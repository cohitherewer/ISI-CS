The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brasa set for April debut
                                                     Brasa set for April debut
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Jose Brasa                           
	New Delhi: Spanish coach Jose Brasa is likely to take over as the national hockey coach in the first week of April, according to Indian Olympic Association (IOA) sources.         
	Though the government and the Sports Authority of India (SAI) are still negotiating with Brasa over the terms and conditions of his contract, the appointment of the Spanish coach has almost been agreed upon, said an IOA ad hoc committee member.         
	Brasa, sources said, has expressed his desire to accompany the team to Malaysia for the Azlan Shah Tournament, albeit as an observer. That could be his first assignment with the national team but not as a coach. He wants to get a feel of the team before formally starting.         
	Sources said the government, which has more or less decided to meet Brasas demand for a pay package of $12,000 per month, is still negotiating with the Spanish coach over his other demands.         
	Interestingly, Brasas demand for a Hindi tutor for the first six months of his stay in India is likely to get the governments nod. It is also likely that the government will provide the coach with a house.         
	Not all his demands are going to be accepted. He, too, will have to adjust to our requirements, said the ad hoc committee member.         
	Brasa, one of the most respected coaches on the international circuit, has asked for an eight-member support team for the national team.         
	It includes a trainer, a physio, a masseur, a psychologist, a video analyst and a number of assistant coaches.         
	Brasa will certainly have to cut down on his support staff to some extent. Also, the government may ask him to pick most of his staff from India instead of bringing them from Europe.         
	Brasa has also asked for a fully furnished house, school fees for his children and salaries for a servant and a maid servant.         
	He has also written to us saying that the coach should be paid bonus money for winning important tournaments. We are looking into these things and will intimate him shortly, the official said.

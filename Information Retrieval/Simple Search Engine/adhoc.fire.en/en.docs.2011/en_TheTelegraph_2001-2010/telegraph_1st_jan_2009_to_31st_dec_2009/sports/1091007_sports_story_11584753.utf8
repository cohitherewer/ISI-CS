The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Insulted, Usha breaks down
                                                     Insulted, Usha breaks down
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            P.T. Usha                           
	Bhopal: Sprint queen P.T. Usha broke down after she was not given proper accommodation at the National Athletics Meet in Bhopal, alleging humiliation.         
	Usha, winner of Asian Games Gold Medal, was in tears after organisers treated her shabbily at Bhopal airport Monday night. There was nobody to receive her at the Raja Bhoj airport. Next, there was no accommodation for her.         
	The Shivraj Singh Chauhan regime too remained a mute spectator saying that it was an internal matter between the Sports Authority of India (SAI) and that the state government had nothing to do with it.         
	Usha had arrived in Bhopal from Mumbai, accompanying an athletics team, which had come to participate in the 49th National Open Athletics Meet, as coach. The meet began in Bhopal Tuesday.         
	Usha could not believe that the SAI centre in Bhopal, which has her photograph framed, did not care to provide her a room in any of the citys hotels. I never expected such kind of behaviour, but then things work like this only in our country and that is the reason we are far behind the rest of the world, Usha said with tears rolling down her eyes.         
	The golden girl first had to wait at the airport for almost four hours before some officials from SAI arrived. She was later asked to share a room with five other girls.         
	Shocked, Usha shifted to the Indian Coffee House Restaurant and Hotel in the TT Nagar area of the state capital where a room was eventually booked by her husband. She took her meals over there. I took the meals at around two in the afternoon as I was hungry, she said.         
	Tuesday evening, the Shivraj government moved her to a posh hotel. State sports minister Tukojirao Puar blamed SAI.         
	It was SAIs responsibility to ensure proper accommodation for Usha. There was no information to the state government about her programme. Had she or SAI informed us in advance, we would have accorded her state guest status after bringing the matter to the notice of the chief minister, Puar said.         
	Event organisers, the Madhya Pradesh Amateur Athlete Association (MPAAA), which is affiliated to the Athletics Federation of India (AFI), said their intention never was to mete out unworthy treatment or provide bad accommodation to anyone.         
	She (Usha) knows me well. Whenever she has come here, she has received good treatment. I never thought of giving bad accommodation to her or to any other athlete. I have apologised for what has happened, said Mumtaz Khan, secretary MPAAA.         
	Earlier, the AFI apologised saying that the sub-standard accommodation was provided to her because of a communication gap.         
	Lalit Bhanot, AFI secretary said: It is not good that she cries on national television. But, you have to see the circumstances in which this happened. We are sorry about this, but it was due to a communication gap. However, we have spoken to her and she is fine with the current arrangement. She has definitely made her nation proud and she will be taken care of, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shukla is first KKR captain
                                                     Shukla is first KKR captain
                                    
	Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla will lead the Kolkata Knight Riders in their first practice match, in Bloemfontein, on Tuesday morning. The second outing, in the afternoon, will see Delhis Aakash Chopra as the nominated captain.         
	While the batting line-ups will be finalised by coach Matthew Mott, The Telegraph learns that the field settings will be determined by the bowlers and the wicket-keeper (Morne van Wyk).         
	Shukla and Chopra wont have a role there.         
	Those who reached Bloemfontein on Monday evening, Sourav Ganguly, for example, will need to acclimatise themselves first and may be considered for the matches on Wednesday.

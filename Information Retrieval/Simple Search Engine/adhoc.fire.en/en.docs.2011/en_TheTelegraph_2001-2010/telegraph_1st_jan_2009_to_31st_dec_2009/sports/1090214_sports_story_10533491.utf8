                                                   Emphatic win for Dempo
                      
	Margao: Dempo SC fashioned an emphatic 3-0 win over Mumbai FC in the 15th round of the ONGC I-League at the Nehru stadium on Friday.         
	Dempo took the lead in the 20th minute when a combined move between Anthony Pereira and Roberto DSilva in the middle saw the latter releasing an unmarked Ranty Martins whose stiff grounder found the target.         
	Eight minutes later, Dempo increased the lead when a measured cross from Anthony Pereira from the right met Clifford Mirandas diving header to give the home team a 2-0 lead at half time.         
	Dempo completed the tally when substitute Clifton Gonsalves found the net from close off a pass from substitute Jerry Zirsanga in the 83rd minute.         
	Dempo could have won by a bigger margin had it not been for Mumbai keeper Kalyan Chaubey who brought of good saves off Martins, DSilva and Sameer Naik.         
	The win took Dempo to 22 points from 15 matches while Mumbai FC remained at the fourth place with 23 points from 15 matches.         
	The Goan club however, have split points in their 13th and 14th round matches against Churchill Brothers and Vasco SC.           (PTI)

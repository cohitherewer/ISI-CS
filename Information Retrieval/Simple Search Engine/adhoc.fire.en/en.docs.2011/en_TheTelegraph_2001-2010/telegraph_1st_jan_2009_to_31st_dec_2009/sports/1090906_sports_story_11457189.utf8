	Vasily Berezutsky struck in the 17th minute before Tottenham Hotspurs Pavlyuchenko converted two penalties in the 39th and 45th minutes.         
	Second-placed Russia, who have 18 points from seven matches, visit Wales on Wednesday. Finland are third on 13 points after their 2-1 win in Azerbaijan on Saturday.         
	In Kiev, Ukraine thrashed Andorra 5-0 in their Group 6 qualifier to draw level in second place on 14 points with Croatia, seven points behind leaders England.         
	Impressive 19-year-old Ukraine debutant Andriy Yarmolenko opened the scoring 18 minutes into the first half. Artem Milevskiy made it 2-0 on the stroke of half-time.         
	Andriy Shevchenkoscored from the penalty spot on 71 minutes after a foul by Marc Vales on Milevskiy just inside the area. Milevskiy earned another penalty in injury time to make it 4-0 and yet another penalty completed the rout after a Vales handball in the area.

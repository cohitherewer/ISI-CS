The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhajji loses cool again
                                                   Bhajji loses cool again
                      
	Bangalore: Harbhajan Singh finds himself in the middle of a controversy all over again after the off-spinner jabbed at a cameraman at the Bangalore International Airport Wednesday.         
	The feisty off-spinner, often in the news for all the wrong reasons, jabbed at the cameraman after his camera brushed his head         
	Harbhajan glared at the cameraman even as a security person tried to push back the pack of lensmen who had the cricketer virtually mobbed.         
	The Punjab spinner has a rather dubious disciplinary record, having been penalised for various offences during his career.         
	The most infamous of these has been 2007s monkeygate incident involving the off-spinner and Andrew Symonds.         
	In the same year, Harbhajan, playing for Mumbai Indians, was banned for the remainder of the IPL matches for slapgate  which was him slapping S. Sreesanth.         
	These flare-ups of a temperamental sportsman will be of little help to the offie in his dream of leading India some day because that is one honour that Harbhajan covets.         
	So, although the soft-spoken Virender Sehwag does not want to lead Team India, the feisty Harbhajan thinks its a challenge worth taking up.         
	However, some of the national selectors, including chairman Krishnamachari Srikkanth, said they were not aware of Sehwags comments.         
	Sehwag had said that a new vice-captain be appointed with an eye to grooming him to take over from Dhoni. Harbhajan said Mahendra Singh Dhoni was doing a fantastic job at the helm but he made no secret of his desire, saying he would not shy away if the captaincy came his way.         
	Whoever plays for India wants to lead the side at some stage and its no different with me.         
	At the end of the day, its a huge honour for a player, Harbhajan said before leaving for the tri-series in Sri Lanka.         
	Incidentally, Harbhajan had a taste of captaincy, leading Air India Blue to the Sahara BCCI Corporate Trophy final where his team lost to the Yuvraj Singh-led Air India Red.

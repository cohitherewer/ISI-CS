	Calcutta: L. Bombayala Devi, part of Indias archery squad for the Beijing Olympics, failed to make it to the womens recurve team for the Archery World Cup Stage IV to be held in Shanghai from August 4-9.         
	Rimil Buriuly (Steel Plant Sports Board), Dola Banerjee (Railways), Pratima Boro (Steel Plant Sports Board) and Reena Kumari (Railways) were named in the team after the completion of the selection trials at the SAI Eastern Centre in Salt Lake here Monday.         
	Chandigarhs Kapil clinched the lone berth in the mens recurve team. He joined Rahul Banerjee, Jayanta Talukdar (both Steel Plant Sports Board) and Mangal Singh Champia for the Shanghai event. Kapil totalled 2657 points at the end of the trials.         
	Rahul, Jayanta and Mangal will represent the country in the World Championships to be held in Ulsan (South Korea) from September 1-9.         
	Bombayala, who was part of the womens recurve team in the World Cup Stage III, held in Turkey last month, finished seventh in the trials.         
	Incidentally, the trio of Rimil, Dola and Pratima comprise the womens team for the World Championships in Ulsan.         
	Meanwhile, the 4th Asian Grand Prix, scheduled in New Delhi from September 15-19, will now be held in Calcutta due to logistical problems.

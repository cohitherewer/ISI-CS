The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spain firm favourites
                                                   Spain firm favourites
                      
	Bloemfontein: Spain will be firm favourites to reach a major tournament final for a second successive year when they play the United States in Wednesdays Confederations Cup semi-final in Bloemfontein.         
	The European champions coasted through to the last four with three comfortable wins in contrast to a dramatic late surge by the unfancied Americans and the Spaniards are hungry for more silverware.         
	We are trying to keep winning, keep playing our game, striker Fernando Torres told reporters.         
	We have ambitions yet and want to win a lot more. After 44 years we won the European championship, now we want a first Confederations Cup for our country.         
	Whoever we face will be tough. We have to prepare as well as always, added teammate Xavi Alonso. Everything is looking very positive right now. We are always trying to progress.         
	The US were surprised to reach the semi-finals.         
	Spain are a great team, we played against them in Santander just before they went on to win the Euro. We know the way they move the ball around and keep possession, said coach Bob Bradley after his side finished second in Group B ahead of world champions Italy on goals scored.

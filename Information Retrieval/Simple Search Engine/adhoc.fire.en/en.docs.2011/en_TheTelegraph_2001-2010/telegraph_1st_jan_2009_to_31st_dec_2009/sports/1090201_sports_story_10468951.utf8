                  Sandeep Singh               
	Chandigarh: India started their campaign in the four-nation Punjab Gold Cup hockey on a winning note, defeating New Zealand 2-0 at the floodlit Sector 42 hockey stadium, here Saturday.         
	India forced New Zealand on to the backfoot right from the start and earned their second penalty corner in the 17th minute.         
	Rajpal Singh and Arjun Hallapa combined well to earn the penalty corner.         
	Skipper Sandeep Singh made no mistakes and scored the first goal in the 18th minute. The early goal unsettled the visitors and they never really managed to find their rhythm.         
	Playing in front of a home crowd that cheered them all the way, Shivender Singh completed the tally in the 61st minute off a reverse hit after receiving a pass from Sandeep.         
	The atmosphere was electric as firecrackers lit the evening sky celebrating Indias win.         
	This victory earned the hosts three points. (PTI)

                                                   Tait replaces Symmo on contract list 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Australia (CA) National Selection Panel (NSP) Friday advised that South Australian quick Shaun Tait would replace Queensland all-rounder Andrew Symonds on the 25-man CA player list to be offered contracts for the 2009-10 season.         
	With Cricket Australia now withdrawing its previous contract offer to Andrew Symonds, Shaun Tait has moved into a position where he has been offered a CA contract offer for 2009-10 under the rankings system CA uses to offer contracts to players, CA NSP chairman Andrew Hilditch said in a statement.

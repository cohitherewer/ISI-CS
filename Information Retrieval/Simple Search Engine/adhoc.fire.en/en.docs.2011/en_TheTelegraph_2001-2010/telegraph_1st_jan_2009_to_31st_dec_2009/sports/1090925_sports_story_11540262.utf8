                                                   Bhullar at tied 28th
                      
	Kyoto: Fresh from his DLF Masters win last week, rising Indian star Gaganjeet Bhullar carded a level-par 71 to be placed at tied 28th after the first round of the Asia-Pacific Panasonic Open here Thursday.         
	Compatriot Jyoti Randhawa had a tough day in the greens as the Delhi golfer brought home a one-over 72 to lie tied 44th.         
	However, Digvijay Singh and Shiv Kapur risk missing the cut with a three-over 74 and five-over 76 respectively to be at tied 71st and tied 103rd at the Joyo Country Club here. Further down the order is senior pro Gaurav Ghei at tied 127th with a horrendous 10-over 81.         
	At the top, Lam Chih Bing of Singapore and local player Tetsuya Haraguchi blasted identical five-under 66 to grab the lead. (PTI)

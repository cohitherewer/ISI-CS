The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hewitt ousts Del Potro
                                                   Hewitt ousts Del Potro
                      
	Wimbledon: Even on one good leg, Venus Williams is tough to beat at Wimbledon.         
	The five-time champion wore a strap on her left knee on Thursday but still advanced to the third round by beating Kateryna Bondarenko of Ukraine 6-3, 6-2.         
	In the mens draw, No. 5 Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina became the highest seed to be eliminated so far, losing in straight sets to Lleyton Hewitt of Australia.         
	Tournament favourite Venus has been hampered by knee trouble in the past, but there was no indication of a problem this week until she walked onto sunny Court 1 bandaged from mid-calf to mid-thigh.         
	She let out a yelp when she appeared to pull up on a backhand in the third game, perhaps because of the knee. Otherwise she moved across the grass freely, charging forward to pounce on short balls. She won 17 points at the net to two for Bondarenko.         
	Venus was coy about the reason for the tape. Just for support, she said twice in response to questions.         
	Pressed about what was wrong with her knee, she said: What happened was that I needed some support, and then I went and got the support, and then I wore it in the match. Ill be wearing it in doubles, too. So its working out. I mean, I think all the players might start wearing it because its so supportive.         
	Venus later played doubles with her sister, Serena. Their mother and coach, Oracene Price, declined to discuss Venus knee.         
	In mens play, two-time runner-up Andy Roddick lost serve only once and defeated Igor Kunitsyn 6-4, 6-2, 3-6, 6-2. Roddick will next play No. 26 Jurgen Melzer, the Wimbledon boys champion in 1999.         
	Hewitt, who won Wimbledon in 2002, beat Del Potro 6-3, 7-5, 7-5 to break an 11-match losing streak against top-five players.         
	I love playing in England, said the Australian, who was cheered on by an often raucous group of yellow-clad Australian fans on Centre Court. It feels like a second home, really.         
	Hewitt was broken for the first time when serving for the match at 5-4 in the third set, but broke right back. He then double-faulted on his first match point in the next game before Del Potro sent a shot long on the second.         
	Del Potro has a history of struggling on grass, and also lost in the second round the previous two years at Wimbledon.         
	Joining Venus in the womens third round was French Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, who beat Pauline Parmentier 6-1, 6-3 in 59 minutes.         
	The Roland Garros runner-up, top-ranked Dinara Safina, never faced a break point and beat Rossana de Los Rios 6-3, 7-5.         
	Last years French Open winner, No. 13 seed Ana Ivanovic, beat Sara Errani 7-5, 6-1. Samantha Stosur, seeded 18th, a Roland Garros semi-finalist this month, swept the last five games to beat qualifier Tatjana Malek 4-6, 7-6 (6), 6-4.         
	Kuznetsova found the court assignments strange  she was on Court 3, while Safina and former No. 1-ranked players Ivanovic, Jelena Jankovic and Amelie Mauresmo were also on smaller courts.         
	Im fine to put me wherever they want to me put, Kuznetsova said in slightly broken English. They dont have to put me on Centre Court. But with the schedule, this is little bit weird thing....But, you know, in Wimbledon you have to expect anything.         
	The third-seeded Venus lost only six points on her serve, two on double-faults. She slammed three aces in her first service game and finished with six.         
	She was just as ferocious with her returns. When one serve came at Williams slower than a lorry on the motorway, she eagerly stepped into the court, took a lusty swing and hit a winner.         
	That took her to set point in the first set, and she whacked another big return on the next point to win the set. There was no letup from there, and she swept the final four games.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger Woods makes strong start
                                                   Tiger Woods makes strong start
                      
	Chaska: Four-time winner Tiger Woods made a strong start at the US PGA Championship, recording two birdies in his first nine holes in Thursdays opening round.         
	On a humid, breezy day at Hazeltine National, the American world No. 1 rolled in a 12-footer at the par-four 12th before splashing out from a greenside bunker to within a foot of the hole at the par-five 15th.         
	That left Woods, who teed off at the par-four 10th in pursuit of his 15th Major title, two strokes off the early lead.         
	Australian Robert Allenby and American Dustin Johnson, after 11 holes, were knotted at three under with Michael Bradley of the US (seven). (Reuters)

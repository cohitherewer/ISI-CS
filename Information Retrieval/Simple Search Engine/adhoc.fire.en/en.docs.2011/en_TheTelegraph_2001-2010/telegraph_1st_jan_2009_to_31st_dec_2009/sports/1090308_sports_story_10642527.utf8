                                                   Violence mars Israels Cup tie 
                      
	Malmo (Sweden): Dozens of anti-Israel activists clashed with police on Saturday as they tried to storm a closed arena where Sweden and Israel were playing a Davis Cup match.         
	The activists hurled rocks and firecrackers at police vans as they tried to break through the barricades set up to keep protesters from the arena. Hundreds of riot police pushed them back using truncheons.         
	There were no immediate reports of injuries. At least five people were detained, police spokesman Lars Hakan Lindholm said.         
	The clashes erupted after about 7,000 people gathered at a square in downtown Malmo to hear speeches condemning Israels offensive in Gaza and urging support for Palestinians.         
	Organisers of the Stop The Match protest had said the demonstration would be peaceful, but extreme-left activists had vowed to disrupt the match, which is being played without fans. Swedens Left Party leader Lars Ohly told the crowd that the European Union and the rest of the world should boycott the racist regime in Israel.         
	Sweden took a 2-1 lead over Israel behind closed doors on Saturday when Robert Lindstedt and Simon Aspelin won the doubles 6-4, 1-6, 7-6, 6-4 over Andy Ram and Amir Hadad.         
	Sweden and Israel had been locked at 1-1 on Friday. Thomas Johansson, back after surgery on his heel in November, had put the Swedes ahead with a hard-fought 6-7, 6-4, 7-5, 4-6, 8-6 win over Harel Levy.         
	But Dudi Sela put Israel on level terms beating Andreas Vinciguerra 4-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 11-9.         
	Meanwhile, last years runners-up Argentina shrugged off the absence of their three top players to go 2-0 up against the Netherlands, while Russia and Croatia also enjoyed two wins in Fridays opening singles, over Romania and Chile respectively.         
	Defending champions Spain, however, were forced to wait to begin their defence against Serbia because high winds in Benidorm made the scaffolding supporting their purpose-built stadium unsafe.         
	In Buenos Aires, the crowd was also sparse in the absence of world No. 14 David Nalbandian, who has a viral infection, and Nos 7 and 45 Juan Martin del Potro and Jose Acasuso, both left out by mutual consent.         
	The few fans were rewarded with a opening match lasting nearly four hours in which Juan Ignacio Chela beat Jesse Huta Galung 6-2, 2-6, 6-2, 6-7, 6-2.         
	Juan Monaco, making his first appearance since the 2006 final against Russia, then defeated Thiemo de Bakker 6-1, 6-2, 7-6. Mario Ancic and Marin Cilic both enjoyed convincing wins for Croatia in Porec.         
	Despite a comfortable win over Victor Crivoi in Russias opening rubber in Sibiu, Marat Safin was not entirely happy, saying the fast indoor surface had given him problems.         
	Mikhail Youzhny overcame Romanian No.1 Victor Hanescu 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 in the second singles to give the Russians a 2-0 lead.         
	Germany and Austria were also locked at 1-1 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen after the home teams Rainer Schuettler lost to Stefan Koubek and Philipp Kohlschreiber came back from two sets down to beat Juergen Melzer.         
	Stanislas Wawrinka, Switzerlands top player in the absence of Roger Federer who has a back injury, served strongly to put his side 1-0 up against the United States in Birmingham, Alabama, with a 3-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 win over James Blake.         
	World No.6 Andy Roddick evened the score for the former champions by defeating Marco Chiudinelli, ranked 341st, 6-1, 6-3, 7-6 in the second singles. (Agencies)

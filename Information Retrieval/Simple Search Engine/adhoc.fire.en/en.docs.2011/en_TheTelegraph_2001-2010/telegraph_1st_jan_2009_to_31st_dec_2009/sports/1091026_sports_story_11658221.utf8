The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vettori wants Wright
                                                   Vettori wants Wright
                      
	Wellington: Former New Zealand coach Andy Moles has confirmed a lack of player support was behind his shock resignation less than a year into his tenure.         
	Moles, 48, who was contracted until the 2011 World Cup, resigned on Saturday following an internal review and only two days after New Zealand Cricket (NZC) affirmed his position amid speculation that unnamed senior players wanted him removed.         
	New Zealand have not named a replacement and will head to the United Arab Emirates for a limited-overs series against Pakistan next month without a head coach.         
	Captain Daniel Vettori, named by the local media as one of the disaffected players, nominated former New Zealand captain and India coach John Wright as a candidate to fill the vacuum while administrators scour for a replacement.         
	Theres no reason we cant utilise his skills. Not necessarily in a head coaching role, but it would almost be remiss of us not to tap into his knowledge, he said.         
	Moles was told he had lost the confidence of the players in a meeting with NZC chief executive Justin Vaughan and had felt blindsided by the revelation, he told local media.         
	Thats the most disappointing thing, Moles was quoted as saying by a newspaper here.         
	Weve been going 11 months but I had no inkling, no communication to say there was a problem until we got back from South Africa (this month).

                                                     Roger triumphs in see-saw tie
                  Federer in action on Friday                     
	Paris: Roger Federer will get another chance to complete his career Grand Slam at this years French Open.         
	The 13-time major champion advanced to the final at Roland Garros by rallying to beat Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina 3-6, 7-6 (2), 2-6, 6-1, 6-4 on Friday. He will face Robin Soderling of Sweden in Sundays final.         
	Federer struggled to land his shots early in the match, while Del Potro found it hard to miss. But things changed in the fourth set when Federer broke to take a 3-1 lead and won each of the next three games to even the score.         
	In the fifth set, Federer broke Del Potro twice as the crowd cheered every point he made.         
	Earlier, Soderling extended his improbable run by beating Fernando Gonzalez 6-3, 7-5, 5-7, 4-6, 6-4 Friday in a seesaw match.         
	Soderling let a big lead slip away when he lost his serve in the final game of the third and fourth sets. The 23rd-seeded Swede fell behind 3-love and 4-1 in the final set, but down the stretch came up with the kind of shotmaking that helped him upset four-time defending champion Rafael Nadal in the fourth round, and he swept the last five games. Soderling never advanced beyond the third round in his previous 21 major tournaments.         
	Soderling has never won a clay-court title, and the victory over Gonzalez was only his fourth in a five-set match. I did a good job of coming back, Gonzalez said. But Soderling is playing at a really high level. He gets to every ball. I couldnt take him out of position.

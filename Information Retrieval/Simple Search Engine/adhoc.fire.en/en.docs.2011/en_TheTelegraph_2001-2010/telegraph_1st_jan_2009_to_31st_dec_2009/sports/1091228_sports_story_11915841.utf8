	New Delhi: Member of Parliament and IOA northeast commission chairman, Birendra Prasad Baishya was unanimously elected Sunday as the Indian Weightlifting Federation president at its General Body Meeting.

	Indias lone woman Olympic medallist, Karnam Malleswari made her debut in weightlifting administration after she was elected one of the vice-presidents.           
	Ludhiana: The Indian Railways womens team scored a thumping 96-50 win over Chhattisgarh on the opening day of the 60th Senior National Basketball tournament Sunday. In the mens section, Punjab had to toil for each point to score a 93-78 win over Karnataka.        
	London: Soccer could be speeded up by replacing throw-ins with kick-ins, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said on Saturday. The Frenchman believes some clubs gain an unfair advantage simply because they have a player who can propel the ball long distances with their throws.     
	For example at Stoke, for Rory Delap it is like kicking the ball, Wenger told the clubs official website. It is a little bit of an unfair advantage. He is using a strength that is usually not a strength in football.          
	Milan: AS Roma are very interested in signing Luca Toni after the Italian forward was told he could leave Bayern Munich, his agent said on Sunday. Roma have shown great interest, Tullio Tinti told Italian media amid reports a deal had already been done with the Serie A side, who are lacking in striking options.         
	Tashkent: World Cup-winning coach Luiz Felipe Scolari says he turned down an offer from Juventus to stay with Bunyodkor.     
	Scolari said on Bunyodkors website that he rejected Juventus offer because he is completely satisfied at the Uzbek league leaders and Asian Champions League quarter finalists.

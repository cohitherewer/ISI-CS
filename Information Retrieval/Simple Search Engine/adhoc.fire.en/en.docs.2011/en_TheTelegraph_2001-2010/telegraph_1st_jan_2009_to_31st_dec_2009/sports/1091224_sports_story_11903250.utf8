The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Looking to pull it off in style

            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                                
	Calcutta: If you are visiting the Eden after quite a while, chances are you will mistake it for a construction site. But relax, the basic requirements are in place!         
	The two sides of the Club House  heaped with debris till late Wednesday evening after blocks B, C and K, L were razed to the ground  are in sharp contrast to the spruced up surroundings that underline the preparations to host an international match after more than two years. The lush green outfield puts things in perspective.         
	The near half-capacity stadium, though, will have little to complain about. The Karbonn Cup has had its share of thrills and frills so far with an almost unreal run feast before some sanity was restored in Cuttack.         
	The 2-1 scoreline is not unexpected given the intensity with which the two teams have gone about it, although India have a realistic chance of wrapping it up on Christmas eve. This despite missing two match-winners in regular captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and all-rounder Yuvraj Singh. Virat Kohli will take Yuvrajs place in the XI.         
	Stand-in captain Virender Sehwag urged the youngsters to grab the opportunities in an effort to put it beyond the Sri Lankans. When a series is going on, the team has to play the matches irrespective of who is in or out. Definitely, we will miss their (Dhoni, Yuvrajs) services but we have to look at other options, Sehwag said.         
	The youngsters are getting an opportunity to play for their country and if they do well and make a mark its good for the team. The bench will get stronger and stronger.         
	The open space at the Eden, no doubt, will bring back memories of the time when the breeze from the nearby Ganges proved to be a handful. Gone are the concrete blocks that were thought to be an obstacle.         
	The ball is expected to move around till early evening and the team batting first will have to deal with the tricky conditions. The experienced Indian new-ball attack would be eager to use this situation to their advantage.         
	Sehwag, however, felt it wouldnt hamper the batsmens natural strokeplaying and was more concerned about the dew factor. That, in fact, prompted him to talk about his preference to field first.         
	The wicket is expected to be low and slow, true to its nature. Both Sehwag and Lanka coach Trevor Bayliss felt run making wouldnt be a problem.         
	Fielding has been the Indians bane in the series and, naturally, Mike Young made the players work overtime on Wednesday. From ground fielding to catching, the fielding coach made them go through the basics as well as drills simulating match situations. Hopefully, the effort will show on the field.         
	The Lankans are debating whether to play Sanath Jayasuriya and thereby bring some solidity to the middle-order. The top-order, led by the prolific Tillekaratne Dilshan, has been instrumental in putting the runs together but the team have been let down by their middle-order.         
	The Lankan trio of Jayasuriya, Mahela Jayawardene and Dilshan skipped nets Wednesday morning but there were no fitness concerns. The veteran left-hander can come in handy with his experience and Bayliss said his usefulness in their scheme of things was being considered.         
	It seems that the defeat in Cuttack, mainly due to an inept middle order, still hurts.         
	We have to get back to scoring runs so that we can put pressure on the opposition. It does not matter what team you are. If you are under pressure, you will lose wickets. Good sides make their own luck, the Lankan coach said.         
	No doubt a good side will also decide the course of this series.         
	TEAMS         
	India (likely): Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Virat Kohli, Dinesh Karthik, Ravindra Jadeja, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma, Ashish Nehra.         
	Sri Lanka (likely): Upul Tharanga, Tillekaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene, Sanath Jayasuriya, Thilina Kandamby, Nuwan Kulasekara, Suraj Randiv, Lasith Malinga, Ajantha Mendis, Chanaka Welegedara.         
	Umpires: Marais Erasmus, Sanjay Hazare. TV: Shahvir Tarapore.         
	Match Referee: Alan Hurst.         
	Match starts: 2.30pm

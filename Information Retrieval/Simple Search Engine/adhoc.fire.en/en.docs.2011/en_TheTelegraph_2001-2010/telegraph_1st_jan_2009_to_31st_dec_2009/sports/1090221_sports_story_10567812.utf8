                                                     Dhoni: New tour a new challenge

	Christchurch: Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni Friday said India do not start favourites against New Zealand although they are better prepared to handle the seaming conditions they may face during the tour.         
	Its not about what is going around in the media or who is considered favourite. You start from scratch when you go out to the middle. Whatever we have been doing in the past one year we have to do again. It doesnt really change, Dhoni said after the teams arrival.         
	Dhoni said his team, which plays two Twenty20 matches, a five-match ODI series and three Tests during the 48-day tour, will have to adapt quickly as it prepares to take on a team that is dangerous as a unit. India have not won a Test series in New Zealand in 41 years.         
	For me the New Zealand team is more about what they are as a unit, not individuals. Thats their asset. They play well as a team. They back each other. They are a competitive side. It will be a good tour if the weather doesnt spoil it, said Dhoni.         
	The Indians were welcomed by rain after their 27-hour, bone-weary journey from Mumbai to Christchurch, prolonged by two transit layovers at Hong Kong (four hours) and Auckland (three hours).         
	Dhoni said the ODI series triumph against Sri Lanka will stand the Indians in good stead, just as the Black Caps would benefit from the drawn ODI series against Australia.         
	It really helps to have tough, competitive cricket under the belt before a big series. You learn a lot. Its not always just about winning or losing. We put a lot of emphasis on the effort we give on the field and believe a lot in the process. The series against Australia will help the New Zealanders. In the same way, playing in tough conditions in Sri Lanka helped us, he said.         
	The captain said the youngsters would have to adapt quickly if the team is to perform to its potential. Its important to practise well and adapt quickly. Most of the guys havent toured New Zealand before.         
	The conditions are very different here. We now have more firepower to exploit the conditions, whether they are seaming conditions or a batting paradise. The first seven days will be important, he said.         
	Dhoni said his pacers are looking forward to exploiting the seaming conditions. The seamers will get a bit of help. That is the first thing that comes to your mind. Apart from that it is windy here. We know a bit about the conditions. But it is about adaptability.         
	It helps that more or less the same group is playing the three formats rather than have five guys coming in just for the Tests. Then it takes them more time to get used to the conditions and that definitely doesnt help the team, Dhoni said.         
	He said the tour would be a massive learning experience for the youngsters in the side, many of whom are coming here for the first time.         
	Its not only about being extraordinarily talented. Its about knowing your limitations and not committing the same mistakes over and over again. It will be a good learning curve for the youngsters. For those who perform, it will be a real confidence booster, for those who dont do so well it will be a valuable learning experience, he said.

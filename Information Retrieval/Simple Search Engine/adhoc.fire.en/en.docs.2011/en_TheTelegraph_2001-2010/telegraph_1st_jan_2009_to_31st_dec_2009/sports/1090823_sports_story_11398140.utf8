  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  ICON ON HIS PROBLEMS WITH AUSSIE COACHES PLUS A LOT MORE      LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Sourav Ganguly closed his India innings at a time when many felt he shouldve waited till, perhaps, the end of the 2008-09 season. The 37-year-old, though, doesnt regret having done so and said as much during a one-on-one with The Telegraph on the eve of leaving for Mumbai. Incidentally, while Souravs days as an international cricketer are over, hes probably more busy now than during the 12-plus years that he was an India regular!               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q You quit playing for India last November. Have you, at any time, regretted having done so?         
	A No... I made the announcement (in the build up to the Test series against Australia) after my mind was made up. I was clear about going.         
	Was there no regret even when England came with a mediocre attack and when we faced pedestrian bowlers in New Zealand?         
	No... To be honest, I havent had the time to sit back and, perhaps, regret... Ive been involved with quite a few things, the IPL being just one... (After a pause) Whoever retires when hes at the top, will always have a year or so of cricket left in him... Sunil Gavaskar (1987), Adam Gilchrist (2008)... They could easily have continued playing, but chose not to... Its hard to reach such a decision, but once made, you should stick by it.         
	There was a suggestion in certain quarters that youd actually reached an understanding with the Board...         
	Not at all... Those reports, which talked about seniors, were without basis... Anil Kumble retired because of a bad shoulder, Rahul Dravid has made a comeback in the one-day team... Had there been any arrangement, then no senior wouldve been playing now.         
	You did very well in your last Test series, playing crucial innings in the two Tests (Mohali, Nagpur) won by India. Werent you disappointed that nobody in the Board asked you to put your decision on hold?         
	It doesnt happen that way... At the end of the day, its a personal decision and people respect it... Having said so, when I spoke to teammates before making the announcement, in Bangalore, a lot of them felt it wasnt the right decision... Kumble, for example, said I should wait till the end of that series... My mind, though, was made up... I was touched by their sentiments, but Id decided to leave.         
	For a while, it seemed age had become an absolute obsession...         
	(Interrupting) Not any more... Rahuls back, in ODIs, at the age of 36... Ashish Nehra, who is 30, got recalled a few months ago... The selectors need to be complimented... Theyve taken the right step, for age should never be a criterion for selection... The IPL is such a fine example... The champions in the first two editions have been led by captains (Shane Warne, Gilchrist) whove retired from international cricket. What does that say?         
	How often, after November, have you viewed footage of your better innings?         
	Havent watched anything from my personal collection... But, occasionally, Ive seen what gets shown on ESPN or Star Cricket.         
	As we speak, which innings come to mind instantly?         
	Loads, actually... My comeback one, in South Africa (51 not out, in the first innings at the Wanderers, 2006-07), which helped India win its first-ever Test in that country, the 128 at Headingley, which helped us beat England (in the 2002 Test series), my debut Test hundred (131) at Lords, in 1996... Also, my hundred (102) in Mohali, against Australia, in my last Test series... The ODI list would be rather lengthy...         
	Today, critically, how do you look back on your international career?         
	With satisfaction... I played 113 Tests (7,212 runs) and 311 ODIs (11,363 runs)... To have played that many matches for India is reason enough to be satisfied... Whats more satisfying, at this point in time, is that Indian cricket is going forward... With help from teammates, the period of my captaincy (March 2000 to September 2005) saw India win Tests (and one-day tournaments) overseas... The impression that we were outstanding at home, but soft outside, changed. That legacy is being carried forward... Now, when the team travels abroad, people at home expect wins. Its a nice expectation.         
	But dont you think you under-achieved in Tests... That you shouldve averaged much more than 42-plus and scored more than 16 hundreds?         
	Dont forget that there were instances when I batted at No.6... Dont think that 7,000-plus is a bad achievement... I wasnt clever enough to get many not outs (17 from 188 Test innings)... Not outs, after all, help improve the average... Also, till (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni arrived, India had a long tail and that didnt help when I batted at No.6.         
	Talking of captaincy, how long did it take to settle down in the job, which is hugely demanding?         
	There was no time to settle down, as youve put it...         
	Did you draw inspiration from anybody youd seen captaining?         
	Not really.         
	What was your approach?         
	I had one obsession  to win... At the end of the day, youre judged by the success achieved... I realised that the players needed a lot more freedom to play, needed a lot less pressure to perform... Clearly, the only pressure on them should be that of having to perform, not the pressure of selection... When a batsman takes guard, he shouldnt be worrying about whether hell be playing the next match or not. The atmosphere has to be conducive.         
	Youre Indias most successful (21 wins) Test captain. Who qualifies to be a difference-making one?         
	Somebody who can identify match-winners and who can handle players well.         
	Where does Dhoni figure in your ratings?         
	Hes been doing very well, but has been fortunate to get a good team... I do believe that a captain is only as good as his team... That applied to me, it applies to Dhoni... That bit wont change.         
	But would you have done a Dhoni and staged a walkout at a media session on the eve of a major tournament, such as the World T20?         
	Can happen in the heat of the moment... Im sure Dhoni will learn... Hes young (28) and, when youre young, you do things which you probably wouldnt if you were more mature. Five years later, Dhoni may himself reflect on the incident (in Nottingham) very differently.         
	Some see your captaincy traits in Dhoni...         
	I havent looked at Dhonis captaincy with the intention of comparing styles... The best thing about his captaincy is that he (too) backs his players... To get the best out of his team, a captain needs to do that.         
	What would you tell rookie captains?         
	(Laughs) Go with your instincts... Captaincy cant be learnt from computers and, so, be ready for decision-making on the field... An eye for players is important, as is the ability to manage them.         
	Obviously, in your book, the captain is the boss?         
	Its not about being the boss, cricket teams arent run that way. For a team to be successful, everybody needs to work towards a common goal... Cricket is a team sport... Its about adjusting (in the dressing room), helping each other and sticking with each other.         
	Why did you have problems with coaches from Australia  Greg Chappell and John Buchanan?         
	Dont know... Really dont know.         
	Was it because of the desire to control the dressing room?         
	Couldve been...         
	Enough adjustments, then, werent made by you and them?         
	Wouldnt like to get into all that... Chappell and Buchanan are part of the past and I dont wish to go down that road.         
	Matthew Hayden, who quit pretty recently, has joined the board of Cricket Australia. Is that something else we need to learn from the Australian system?         
	Theres a difference... In Australia, they get nominated to the board, its different in India, where you need to get elected.         
	Agreed, but the tendency in the subcontinent is to strongly discourage former players from getting into administration. Why?         
	I wouldnt like to get into that... Please leave me out on this one.         
	Youre on the Boards technical committee. How did your first meeting go?         
	Good... Im happy that our suggestions are being implemented... The bowlers, I feel, should have a say in the brand of balls to be used (in domestic cricket)... They should bear in mind what will help them get wickets overseas.         
	Could we see you in the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) presidents chair next July?         
	Ill have to wait and see... A lot of things will decide that... Many factors will come into play... I wish to repeat that Im not around either to fight with people or to put people down.         
	Realistically, how much of a difference could you make?         
	Of course, one can make a difference... One could help create an atmosphere where the players only worry about performing... There are other things, but I wouldnt like to talk about them in public.         
	Youve called Jagmohan Dalmiya a legend...         
	He is... Hes done so much for Indian cricket, hes done so much for cricket in Bengal. The label suits him.         
	When will somebody from the state come close to being a Sourav Ganguly?         
	(Grins) Will take time, but the process of having another Sourav definitely has to start somewhere... The effort and time put in by the players would be critical... The players persistence and, as important, ability to handle the ups and downs will also be a factor... The administrators have a big role to play as well.         
	Right now, some of the India players arent from the established centres of cricket. Should the CAB focus more on the districts instead of largely being Calcutta-specific in its approach?         
	Im sure the CAB is looking at the districts... Perhaps, we need to revisit how players are currently being judged, particularly in local cricket.         
	Is todays generation eager for instant success, without actually putting in the sweat and tears?         
	Wont be able to answer that.         
	T20 has become such a craze...         
	Look, Id like to tell the young players that theyll eventually be remembered for their achievements in Test cricket, not in T20. But, yes, theyll need the expertise to play all forms, including T20.         
	You have nothing left to prove. That being so, can the IPL really motivate you?         
	Yes, because thats a tournament Id like to win for the franchise (Kolkata Knight Riders)... As a cricketer, Ive tasted success in all forms, except this T20... I dont, of course, have to prove anything to anybody.         
	One feels the Knights lack the ammo to win the IPL...         
	I dont agree... Weve got the team... We need to fire collectively and consistently... Need a good environment as well.         
	You were, understandably, very upset when you lost the Knights captaincy on the eve of the IPLs second edition, this year. How long did it take you to get over the sacking?         
	It happened in April, in Cape Town... Ive moved on, leaving Cape Town behind.         
	Its being taken for granted that youll be back as the Knights captain. How would you, at this point in time, describe your relationship with the principal owner, Shah Rukh Khan?         
	Ive always had a good relationship with Shah Rukh, its just that Buchanan took all the decisions last season... Everybody in the franchise needs to believe that a difference can be made, otherwise things wont work.         
	The Knights kept floundering in the second edition...         
	Were looking ahead... We know the franchise has to perform and its on performance alone that one will be judged.         
	Your show on TV, Dadagiri Unlimited, has been attracting much attention... Pleasantly surprised?         
	Im glad that the response has been good... Initially, Id been a bit nervous about playing the quizmaster, but Ive settled down. Playing cricket, I must say, is much easier!         
	The last one: Australia are on the verge of losing the Ashes. If you had a role to play, would you continue with Ricky Ponting as captain?         
	I would... (After a pause) In 2003-04 itself, Id said the Australians wouldnt be the same once Warne and Glenn McGrath retired. Ive been proved right.

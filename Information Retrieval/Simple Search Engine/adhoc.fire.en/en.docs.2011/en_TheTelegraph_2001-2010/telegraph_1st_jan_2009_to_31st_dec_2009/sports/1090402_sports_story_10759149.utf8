The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Buchanan doctrine is ridiculous, says Dilip
                                                   Buchanan doctrine is ridiculous, says Dilip
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar on Tuesday described John Buchanans concept of multiple captains for the Kolkata Knight Riders as a mockery of the game.         
	For the moment, though, the doctrine has put kept on hold.         
	Speaking during a promotional organised by Pepsi, Vengsarkar said that Buchanans idea would never work in the game of cricket.         
	Cricket has seen a lot of changes because of T20, said the former chief selector. But this idea of having multiple captains is simply ridiculous. I shall be happy to see Sourav Ganguly being retained as captain, Vengsarkar said.         
	There could be a situation where one team has to score six runs from one ball and Sourav might find four people giving him different advises.         
	In that case, Sourav should turn towards Buchanan and ask him what should I do? After all, it was your idea. Frankly, such an idea is not going to work. It is nothing but a mockery of the game, Vengsarkar explained.         
	Vengsarkar also disclosed how Mahendra Singh Dhoni was made the captain of the Indian team for the ICC World T20 in South Africa.         
	I dont know whether you are aware that the Indian board was the last one to agree to T20 format. So, when we were asked to pick up a side that would fit into that format, it was not an easy task.         
	There was one good thing  all of us in the selection committee were in the same wavelength and understood each other very well. We picked Dhoni as the captain. He had not even led his state side till that time. We realised here was a man who knew the game. We asked people who fielded in the slips about him and the feedback was that he was a man who was very intelligent and positive. So we picked him ahead of everyone and we won the World Cup, Vengsarkar said.         
	Recalling the three centuries he scored at Lords, Vengsarkar said his first innings at the Mecca of cricket produced no run.         
	I scored a duck in the first innings of the Lords Test in 1979. When I went in to bat in the second innings, I was determined to score at least one run. Thankfully, I got a hundred, said the former captain.

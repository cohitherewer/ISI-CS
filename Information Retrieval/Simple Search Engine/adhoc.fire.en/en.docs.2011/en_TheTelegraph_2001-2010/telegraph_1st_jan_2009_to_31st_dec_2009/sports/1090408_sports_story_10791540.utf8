	New Delhi: Under Mahendra Singh Dhonis charismatic leadership, India have emerged as one of the top three teams in the world and the captain would only get better with experience, former New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming has predicted.         
	He is a brilliant player. People talk only about his ability to lead. But he is a versatile player as well and leads by example... Fleming said. Off the field, he is humble and has taken success in his stride. Dhoni is a very impressive guy who would get only better with experience, Fleming told a TV channel. (PTI)

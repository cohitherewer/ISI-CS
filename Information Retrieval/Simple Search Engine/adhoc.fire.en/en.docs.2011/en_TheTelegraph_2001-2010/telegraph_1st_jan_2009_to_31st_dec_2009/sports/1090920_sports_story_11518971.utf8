The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhajji wants a century
                                                   Bhajji wants a century
                      
	Johannesburg: Harbhajan Singh, is already a handful with the ball and now the offie wants a century, to fulfil Sunil Gavaskars wish.         
	In a function in Mumbai recently Gavaskar wanted to know when I would hit my first hundred. Coming from him it was a huge thing. Hopefully there would soon be a cause for cheer and it would be for Sunny bhai, said Harbhajan ahead of the Champions Trophy.         
	To his credit, Harbhajan has a lot of batting highlights. He missed one opportunity of scoring a century in Australia in 2007. He once helped India win a Test against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo in 2001, besides saving one against the same team in a Test match at Delhi. He also was at the other end when India won the NatWest Trophy final against England at Lords in 2002.         
	However, it is bowling that would be Indias concern as the team could struggle with their fifth bowling option in South Africa as the conditions are vastly different to the subcontinent where part-time slow bowlers can flourish.         
	I wish we had a bowling all-rounder, somebody like Shaun Pollock, Harbhajan said. That would really help the team.         
	Ishant Sharma, meanwhile, has decided how he wants to help the teams cause in the Champions Trophy.         
	Ishant Saturday said he would be relying more on bouncers as it could prove an effective weapon on the seaming tracks here. But the lanky speedster said he had no plans to drop a yard in speed to regain his form during the tournament beginning September 22.         
	All through these years I didnt think bowling bouncers was necessary. But now I am realising with my pace it can make a difference. I am now practising bowling bouncers, Ishant said.         
	The issue of drop in pace depends on conditions. In Australia you could be quick in air while in subcontinental its different. I am essentially a fast bowler and I dont ever want to be a medium-fast bowler, he said.

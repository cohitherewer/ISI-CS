The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians lose third spot to Sri Lanka
                                                   Indians lose third spot to Sri Lanka
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The annual update of the International Cricket Council (ICC)s Test rankings has cost Team India one ranking place as it slips to fourth, separated by the narrowest possible margin  0.01 of a ratings point  from Sri Lanka at third.         
	Australia held onto the No.1 spot after the update but are now just two ratings points clear of South Africa.         
	The outcome of the ongoing Ashes will be factored in at the end of the final Test in September as the rankings are updated only at the end of each series.         
	Ricky Pontings men need to win the remaining two Tests in the five-match series if they are to stay top of the table. Otherwise it will be South Africas turn at the top of the table.         
	The table reflects all Test series that were completed since August three years ago. All series played until the start of next August will be added to it.         
	Thus, by then the ratings will be based on four years, with series completed within the last two years carrying greater weight.         
	Next August the first year of results will be dropped and this pattern is repeated each August, with the oldest of the four years of results gradually replaced with results of series completed over the following 12 months.         
	Regardless of how the Ashes finishes, England will remain fifth. However, if the home side win the series, Australia will drop to fourth on the table.         
	If the series ends in a 1-1 draw, Australia, Sri Lanka and India will all have the same rating, but Australia will still be clinging on to second place by a decimal point.         
	Australia have led the Test rankings ever since the current method was introduced in May 2003.         
	The progress of Kumar Sangakkaras team in the rankings is due to consistent results during the period under the purview of these rankings.         
	In this period, the side have played 10 series, winning six, drawing three and losing just one (in Australia).         
	However, with New Zealand heading to Sri Lanka this month for a two-Test series, there is potential for imminent change.         
	Gautam Gambhir, at No.2 was the highest-ranked Indian batsman with Sachin Tendulkar (No.15), V.V.S. Laxman (No.17) and Virender Sehwag (No.19) the other Team India faces in the top-20.         
	Among Indian bowlers, Harbhajan Singh was the best-placed at No.6 with Zaheer Khan (No.9) and Ishant Sharma (No.19) the other Indian names in the top-20.

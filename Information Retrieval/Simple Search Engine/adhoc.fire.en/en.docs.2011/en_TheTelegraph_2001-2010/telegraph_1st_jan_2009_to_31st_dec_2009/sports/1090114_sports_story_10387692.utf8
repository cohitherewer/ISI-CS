	Brisbane: Tributes poured in for Matthew Hayden after the southpaw announced his retirement from international cricket.         
	Wife Kellie said it has been a great journey. Im really excited, its going to be great. Its also sad, its been a great journey. Im glad hes made the decision.         
	Former captain Steve Waugh said he redefined the role of an opener.               
	The following are excerpts         
	 Greg Chappell: Its a career he can be rightfully proud of, hes achieved a lot. After early setbacks he went away and re-thought his game and philosophy on batting and he came back an aggressive, positive player. He intimidated bowlers, he was reminiscent to me of someone like Gordon Greenidge.         
	Adam Gilchrist: He was an inspirational player who possessed extraordinary mental strength. His greatest asset was his belief and faith in himself, coupled with an amazing work ethic. Whenever someone told him he couldnt achieve something he just became more determined to prove them wrong. He was a brilliant opening batsman.         
	Glenn McGrath: Its been an absolute honour and a privilege to play with him and even more so to call him a mate. And to me Matty is a legend of the game. Hes got nothing left to prove. His career stands alone. Hes an amazing person and an amazing player.         
	Ricky Ponting: I dont think theres any doubt about that (he is Australias greatest opener). You can even look back through the history books of the game and try and see if theres ever been a better opening batsman in the game, let alone Australia.         
	Shane Warne: He had an aura about him when he went out to bat. The thing that will be missed is his aura around the side with the young players in there now. Its another player gone who will be very hard to replace.         
	Steve Waugh: I think he redefined the art of opening the batting. It was no longer about getting the new ball and wearing the shine off it, he was going to smash the shine off it and really set the stage and dominate and give us the psychological advantage in that first session.           (PTI)

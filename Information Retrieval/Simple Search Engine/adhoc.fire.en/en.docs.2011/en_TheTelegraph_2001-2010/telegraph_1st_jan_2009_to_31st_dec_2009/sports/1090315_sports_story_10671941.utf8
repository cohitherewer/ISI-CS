The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chetri is doubtful 
                                                     Chetri is doubtful 
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Yusif Yakubu will be back after a match ban                           
	Calcutta/Margao: East Bengal striker Sunil Chetri is doubtful for the Sundays I-League clash against Sporting Clube de Goa after aggravating his ankle injury during a practice session on Saturday.         
	Chetri, who first picked up the injury during East Bengals away match against Mahindra United, was in discomfort midway through the practice session and left the ground limping. It will be nothing less than a miracle if he starts on Sunday.         
	East Bengal will, however, welcome back Chetris Ghanaian striking partner Yusif Yakubu, who missed the Mahindra tie due to a double booking.         
	Sporting Clube, who are leading the table on 38 points, though, will be out in full strength.         
	The players know they cannot afford to drop points, as it would jeopardise our chances of winning the title. We have to win this match. Because we dont want to depend on other teams to drop points, said coach Clifford Chukwuma.         
	Sporting have done well in their last four matches, winning against Dempo and Churchill Brothers.         
	If we can take full points from two of the best teams, I believe there is nothing that can stop us from collecting full points against East Bengal, Chukwuma said.         
	East Bengal, who defeated Mohun Bagan on February 22, could not log full points in their next two matches. A draw against Mohammedan Sporting and a loss to Mahindra pegged them back.         
	They are now placed seventh with 23 points from 18 matches.         
	We aim to finish in top four in the I-League and for that we need to win some more matches. Hopefully we will come up trumps on Sunday and our campaign will be back on track once again, coach Subhas Bhowmick said.

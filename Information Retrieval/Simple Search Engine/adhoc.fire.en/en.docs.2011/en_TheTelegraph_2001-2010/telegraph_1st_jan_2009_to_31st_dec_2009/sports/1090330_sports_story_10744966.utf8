                                                   Bravos 69 guides WI to 239/9
                      
	Bridgetown: All-rounder Dwayne Bravo hit a brisk 69 off 72 balls on Sunday to steer the West Indies to 239 for nine off 50 overs in the fourth one-day International against England.         
	The right-hander lashed seven fours and two sixes to guide the home side from the peril of 145 for six to a respectable total at Kensington Oval.         
	Dimitri Mascarenhas led the England attack with three for 26 off 10 overs while Stuart Broad (3/62) also claimed crucial scalps.         
	Captain Chris Gayle gave the West Indies a flying start with a boundary-studded 46 off 39 delvieries.         
	The powerful left-hander continued from where he left off on Friday.           (AP)

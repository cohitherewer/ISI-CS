The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spaniards in rousing form
                                                   Spaniards in rousing form
                      
	London: Spain continued to set the standard on Saturday when they, along with Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, took a significant stride towards next years World Cup finals.         
	Spain beat Turkey 1-0 in Madrid to stretch their unbeaten run to 30 matches and make it 15 points out of 15 in Group Five before they travel to Istanbul for the return fixture on Wednesday.         
	Stuttering France earned a vital 1-0 victory in Lithuania to stay in touch in Group Seven, although they are struggling to keep pace with Serbia who produced the days most impressive performance with a 3-2 win in Romania.         
	Serbia inflicted Romanias first-ever defeat in the Black Sea resort of Constanta to move three points clear in Group Seven although their win was tarnished by the behaviour of fans who threw fireworks and fought with riot police.         
	Goals from Milan Jovanovic and Branislav Ivanovic and an own goal from Dorel Stoica were enough for the Serbs who are on course to repeat their feat of reaching the 2006 World Cup.         
	While Europes big guns shone, several smaller nations kept their dreams of appearing in South Africa on track. Northern Ireland went top of Group Three with a 3-2 home defeat of Poland and Bosnia-Herzegovina crushed Belgium 4-2 away in Group Five. Switzerland are also well-placed after a 2-0 win in Moldova.         
	Gerard Pique scored Spains winner but he was not the only player to score his first goal for his country. Debutant Giampaolo Pazzini claimed Italys second goal as the world champions negotiated a potentially tricky trip to Montengero with a 2-0 win. Andrea Pirlo struck the opener.         
	Irelands home draw with Bulgaria means the Italians hold a two-point lead in Group Eight which looks like providing a relatively comfortable passage into the finals. Germany appear in total control of Group Four after thrashing Liechtenstein 4-0.         
	Captain Michael Ballack and Marcell Jansen put the hosts two up inside 10 minutes and they cantered to victory with further goals from Bastian Schweinsteiger and Lukas Podolski. They are four points clear of Russia who beat Azerbaijan.         
	The Netherlands are running away with Group Nine after a 3-0 home defeat of their closest rivals Scotland. Goals from Klaas Jan Huntelaar and Robin van Persie left the Dutch with an eight-point lead after just four games.         
	France needed a second-half strike from Franck Ribery to earn the three points in Lithuania, a result that put them third in Group Seven, five points behind leaders Serbia.

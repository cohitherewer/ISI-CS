	London: Andy Murray wasted 12 of 13 break points before overcoming Fernando Verdasco 6-4, 6-7 (4), 7-6 (3) Thursday to close in on a semi-final spot at the ATP World Tour Finals.         
	The result eliminates Verdasco from the tournament after his third straight round-robin loss.         
	Murray was never broken but struggled with an erratic serve, mixing 18 aces with nine double-faults. He clinched the win when Verdasco missed a forehand wide on the first match point. Murray wasted seven break points spread over three games in the second set, and paid for it in the tiebreaker. Verdasco took a 6-4 lead with a forehand winner, and the Briton then double-faulted on set point.         
	The Spaniard had his only break point of the match at 5-4 in the second set, but Murray responded with a service winner to stay in the set.         
	Murray seemed in full control in the first set, but again struggled to use his opportunities to pull away. He finally converted his fifth break point of the set to take a 5-4 lead when Verdasco netted a simple backhand volley after a long rally where Murray chased down two overhead smashes.         
	The Scot then needed four set points before serving it out in the next game.         
	In the doubles, already assured of a place in the semi-finals, Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles finished their group engagements in the World Tour Finals with a straight set defeat against defending champions Danie Nestor and Nenad Zimonjic here.         
	The third seed Indo-Bahamin pair lost their last group B match 4-6, 6-7 to the top seeded Canadian-Serbian duo after battling for one hour and 18 minutes.         
	This was first win for Nestor and Zimonjic in the season-ending prestigious tournament and they failed to graduate to the next stage.         
	Bhupathi and Knowles had won their first two matches to secure a place in the semi-final stage.         
	Bhupathi was hopeful to make the summit clash.         
	Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Leander Paes and his partner Lukas Dlouhy suffered a straight-set defeat against American Byran brothers Bob and Mike to be out of contention for a last four spot, as reported in Thursdays Late City Edition.         
	Paes and Dlouhy, winners at Roland Garros and the US Open this season, had lost their first Group B doubles match to Kubot and Marach and are now out of contention after their 3-6, 4-6 loss to the Bryan brothers.         
	The Indo-Czech pair were broken serve once in each set in an 84-minute match by their rivals who avenged the defeat they suffered in the US Open semi-finals.         
	Paes admitted he and Dlouhy were not in their best form in the season-ending top event here.         
	It was a bit of a rough outing in the last two matches. Its a bit interesting because we won two Grand Slams this year, then the last two days weve been pretty much off rhythm. Could put it down to many reasons. (Agencies)

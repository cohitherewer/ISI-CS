The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB bosses toe the police line
                                                                                                                       7                                      CAB bosses toe the police line
  - Dilip Vengsarkar, Brijesh Patel among dignitaries for Eden One-dayer       A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) authorities have paid heed to the instructions of police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti during his visit to Eden Gardens on Monday.         
	We are strictly following the instructions of the police commissioner. A temporary wall is being constructed on both sides of the Club House to cover up the open ends of the B, C and K, L blocks. We have already started work and expect it to be completed before the inspection. I believe when the final inspection takes place on Wednesday, everything would be in order, joint secretary Biswarup Dey said.         
	The police commissioner had, in a veiled manner, expressed his displeasure since two ends on the right and left of the Dr BC Roy Club House were left open due to the ongoing renovation.         
	The commissioner had instructed that CAB authorities should construct a temporary wall on both sides to prevent any kind of unnecessary intrusion.         
	The CAB authorities have also ensured that debris, including iron rods that were seen jutting out on either side of the Club House, has been cleared.         
	For the first time in many years, the giant electronic scoreboard will not be in use. The scores and replays will be shown on the giant screens that have placed adjacent to the Ranji stands.         
	CAB curator Prabir Mukherjee said that the wicket will be firm and have even bounce.         
	Obviously the team that bats first on this strip will have an advantage, Mukherjee said.         
	Mukherjee, however, seemed unimpressed by the suggestions from Daljit Singh, chairman of BCCIs pitches and grounds committee, on using anti-dew spray ASPA-80.         
	I dont think that the effect of the anti-dew spray will last for more than 10 minutes. The dew will in any case be a factor, Mukherjee felt.         
	The fourth ODI will see a host of dignitaries from various state associations being present at the Eden.         
	Former captain, chief selector and current vice-president of Mumbai Cricket Association Dilip Vengsarkar, Karnataka State Cricket Association secretary Brijesh Patel, BCCI vice-presidents Rajeev Shukla and Arindam Ganguly have all accepted invitations and are expected to be present during the match.         
	The Sri Lankan team manager Brendon Kuruppu and batting coach Stewart Law were interested in going out for a quick city tour on arrival Tuesday but were not allowed due to security reasons.

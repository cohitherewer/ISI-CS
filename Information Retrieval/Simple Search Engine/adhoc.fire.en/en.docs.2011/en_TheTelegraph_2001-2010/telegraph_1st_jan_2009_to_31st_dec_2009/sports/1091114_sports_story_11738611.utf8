The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand held
                                                                                                                                   Anand held
                      
	Moscow: Viswanathan Anand could not breach Alexander Morozevichs iron defence and settled for a draw to remain joint second after seven rounds in the ongoing Tal Memorial chess tournament here.         
	Playing with white, Anand was expected to crush Morozevich, who is going through a slump in form, but the Russian today stood his ground to walk away sharing the point.         
	With 4.5 points, Anand now share the second spot with Vassily Ivanchuk, while Vladimir Kramnik leads the chart with five points.         
	Anand plays Boris Gelfand in the eighth round. Anand played aggressively and kept the back rank occupied till the queens were off the board.         
	But his strong display did not lead to a decisive finish and both the players signed truce after 36 moves. (PTI)

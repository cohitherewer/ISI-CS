	Johannesburg: South Africa have yet to decide if they will participate in a tri-series in Zimbabwe later this year, making Indias announcement that the event would go ahead premature, Cricket South Africa said on Tuesday.         
	India are slated to join South Africa and hosts Zimbabwe for a one-day series in July.         
	Its way too premature for India to confirm that this series is going ahead, CSA chief executive Gerald Majola told reporters.         
	Zimbabwe have spoken to CSA about it but our board still needs to decide whether to reinstate bilateral relations with Zimbabwe.         
	CSA suspended cricketing agreements with its neighbour in June last year because of political turmoil in Zimbabwe.         
	South Africas players have not been consulted about a possible tour and South African Cricketers Association chief executive Tony Irish said the time when it was scheduled to take place had been earmarked as a rest period for them.

                                                   No fixed captain as of now
    - If I was in Souravs place I would be upset, says KKRs John Buchanan             A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) cricket manager John Buchanan on Wednesday made it clear that the side will have no fixed captain during the second edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Former India captain Sourav Ganguly was present at the press conference with Buchanan. The icon player of the team and the skipper in the inaugural edition of the IPL said he was pretty open to the idea and added that his goal was to perform.               
	The following are excerpts               
	The controversy         
	Buchanan: I dont think theres any controversy at all (putting his arm over Souravs shoulder). I am keen to look at different aspects of the game and different ways of running the show. I have got players of calibre leaders in the side like Sourav (Ganguly), (Chris) Gayle, (Brendon) McCullum, (Brad) Hodge etc. A very young talent in Laxmi Ratan Shukla, the Bengal captain A very experienced side. Ive had a very long discussion with Sourav yesterday (Monday). At the moment there is no fixed captain. The decision has got nothing to do with Souravs fitness or performance. In fact, it could actually be of benefit to someone like him because it could free him up for his batting, when he just needs to do his batting or for his fielding when he just needs to do his fielding or when he needs to just do his bowling without the burden of the 20-over format on his shoulders. At the same stage we might be asking him to make some key decisions for us. It has nothing to do with Sourav whatsoever. It has everything to do with how I perceive the 20-over game.         
	The reasons behind the idea         
	Buchanan: The idea is for somebody to lead even if he is off the field... Somebody has to have a better view of the game even if he is in the dressing room or out in the middle during batting. When McCullum is keeping wickets, he will have a better view from behind Similar is the case when you are batting, bowling or fielding. In T20 there is very little time This concept will help. We will be seeking the knowledge of individuals at different stages of the game. Ultimately there will be a captain to make key decisions. The key point here is that Ive to be clear about communicating. There should be no confusion in the side. I believe there is a way to go about in 20-over cricket and were looking forward to it. At the moment we have plenty of time in which to work through this and I think with Souravs help, with Gayles help, with Hodges help, with McCullums help and with the help of the other players, it will work fine.         
	The role of the captain         
	Buchanan: He will have the right to make decisions. He may be asking Sourav before making key decisions. I dont have any issue about it Just different ways of thinking often helps. We are looking at the knowledge of individuals at different stages of the game.         
	If this will lead to problems         
	Buchanan: I dont agree. If there is a conflict we have to communicate and come back to one point.         
	Will the captain change if the team is having a good run, say win three matches at a stretch?         
	Buchanan: If the team is winning, it will mean the captain is dynamic. It doesnt mean one win or loss will change a captain It depends on the discussions.         
	What prompted him to think on these lines?         
	Buchanan: Cricket is going through a transition. This is T20 and we will see some real changes in the future The game is moving from the longer to the shorter version fast and, hence, it demands different ways of thinking Theres nothing between Sourav and me If you (the media) are going to make a big deal about it, go ahead we are not going to do it. The concept of multiple captains is new and we will have to see how it goes Weve got to get a feel of it through the new system. If it doesnt work out its my fault. I think Im going in the right track at this point of time.         
	If playing in South Africa will be a fresh challenge and whether Sourav will be in the side         
	Buchanan: It is a challenge and it is the same for everybody. We dont know the exact conditions, schedule, format and venues. Whether Sourav will be in the side in three weeks or four weeks time is irrelevant at this stage.         
	How is he (Sourav) taking to it?         
	Sourav: John is the coach of the side and he has his views got the right to make decisions. Im pretty open about it. Well see as it goes along. At the end of the day we all have to deliver. My goal is to perform score runs and take wickets.         
	Buchanan: (Interrupting) I want to say if I was in Souravs place I would be upset. He is the king of Kolkata.         
	Sourav: But I am not upset.         
	Buchanan: Sourav is a fine person and very open about his ideas Let others go ahead with their ideas. Were certainly not doing that.         
	The conditions in South Africa         
	Sourav: The conditions will be different in South Africa. There will be more bounce but youll have good wickets to play You can play more shots. Lets see. The boys can also play there Playing can be fun there Look at the India-New Zealand series. Theyre having fun and its a good series.         
	The pressure of playing away from home         
	Sourav: The pressure element will always be there. The situation was different here The elections are bigger than anything. Security is a concern here and the option was to go to South Africa. There was no option left with the franchise.         
	You had problems with Greg Chappell and now John Buchanan has introduced the concept of rotating captains. Do you find any similarity between the Australian coaches         
	Sourav: No, no. Please dont get into all that

                                                   India under-19 stare at defeat
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Australia Under-19 were comfortably placed with 19 for no loss at the end of the Day II of the three-day match against India Under-19 played at Perth.         
	After being shot out for 165 in the first innings, India did hardly better in their second essay and could manage only 184 runs before collapsing.         
	Australias new-ball bowler Kane Richardson had figures of five for 28. For India, however, Manan Sharma hit a brilliant 81, but he had little support. For Australia, left-arm spinner Luke Doran snared four for 25 from 11.5 overs.         
	The Australians then batted well to declare at 223 for seven. Tom Beaton top-scored with 70. Off-spinner Kundan Singh, who has had a memorable tour, was Indias best bowler, with figures of four for 72.         
	Nic Maddinson and Tom Beaton would return Tuesday to knock off the remaining runs.

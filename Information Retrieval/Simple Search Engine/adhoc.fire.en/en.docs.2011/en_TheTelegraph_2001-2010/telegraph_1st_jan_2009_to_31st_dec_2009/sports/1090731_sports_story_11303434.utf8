The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Massa wants his car back 
                                                   Massa wants his car back 
                      
	Budapest: Felipe Massa is already planning a return to racing and joking about keeping Michael Schumacher away from his car as he continues to return to normal following his crash, his doctor said on Thursday.         
	Massas family doctor Dino Altman said the Brazilian driver has begun eating food normally, was walking around his hospital room and took a shower. He also appeared to have no problem in the (left) eye, which doctors feared had been badly injured in the high-speed crash during qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix.         
	He is back to normal, Altman said.         
	Massa has been recuperating at the AEK hospital in Budapest after undergoing surgery on multiple skull fractures.         
	The 28-year-old driver was hit in the helmet by a loose part from another car and crashed into a protective tire barrier.         
	Doctors have ruled out a return to Formula One this season, but Altman said Massa was already sending warnings to Michael Schumacher that his comeback may be short-lived.         
	Ferrari announced Wednesday that the German seven-time F1 champion would come out of retirement to replace Massa until he is fit to return, starting with the European GP from August 21-23, in Valencia, Spain.         
	Lets see if I let him drive my car because I dont give up, Altman quoted Massa as saying.         
	He has no fear at all, Altman told reporters outside the hospital. He thinks he will be able to race in Valencia.         
	Altman said no decision had been made yet about transferring Massa from Budapest. Massas father, Luiz Antonio, said on Wednesday that he was expecting Massa to be transferred to a hospital in Paris soon.

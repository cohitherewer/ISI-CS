                                                     Dhoni lauds Rampaul
                  Dhoni                     
	Gros Islet: West Indian pace bowler Ravi Rampaul has found an admirer in Indian skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who has praised the right-armer for his ability to force mistakes from batsmen by consistently bowling in the right areas.         
	Rampaul returned career-best figures of four for 37 against India as the West Indies beat the visitors by eight wickets in Kingston to stay afloat in the four-match series currently tied 1-1.         
	Rampaul swings the ball really well and bowls in the right area. He forces you to play a big shot like the cover drive, Dhoni said ahead of the third one-day International here on Friday.         
	Rampauls spell left India tottering at 82 for eight after they won the toss and batted first, but Dhoni hit a responsible 95 to lift his side to 188.         
	Dhoni said lack of assistance from the pitch in Kingston made Rampual and fellow pacer Jerome Taylors performance all the more creditable.         
	I dont think there was that much in (the pitch) for the bowlers, Dhoni said.         
	They bowled really well They were swinging the ball well and, when it stopped swinging, they were able to get reverse swing, he added.         
	The 24-year-old Rampaul, who has been hampered by multiple injuries in his career, said that the Kingston performance has given him confidence for the future.         
	A performance like this has really helped me to come back and play international cricket and improve my confidence a lot, Rampaul said.         
	I have been working hard in trying to make it back to the team and I felt good bowling in the last match. I got a bit of swing with the new ball and picked up a couple of wickets It was a good return to international cricket.

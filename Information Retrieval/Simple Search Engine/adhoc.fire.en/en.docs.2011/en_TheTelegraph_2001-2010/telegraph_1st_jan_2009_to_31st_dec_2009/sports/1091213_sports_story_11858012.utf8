	London: Chelsea stretched their lead over Manchester United at the top of the Premier League to three points despite a 3-3 draw with Everton after the defending champion lost 0-1 at home to Aston Villa.         
	Didier Drogba scored twice as Chelsea recovered from an early own-goal by goalkeeper Petr Cech, but Everton fought back to equalise twice and secure a valuable point in its efforts to move away from the bottom of the standings.         
	Chelsea had not conceded a goal at Stamford Bridge since the opening day of the season in August. They have now lost their perfect home record and have not won for four matches, but was helped by Uniteds fourth loss of the season.         
	Gabriel Agbonlahor scored for Villa in the 21st minute with a header from Ashley Youngs curling left-wing cross.         
	Who can say we are in crisis? Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti said. I dont think so. I want to be objective and, when I look at the game and the way we played, I saw that my team played very well. We still have the same chance to win the title. It will be a long race until the end of the season.         
	Also Saturday, Manchester City equalised three times to hold Bolton 3-3 and draw for the eighth time in nine Premier League games, while Tottenhams hopes of staying in contention for Champions League qualification took a big hit with a 1-0 loss against visiting Wolverhampton Wanderers.         
	Chelsea was undone by poor defending at set pieces. Everton had led in the 12th when Sahas header from a free kick hit the post and rebounded into the net off Cechs back. Ricardo Carvalho and Frank Lampard set up Drogba for an equaliser five minutes later, and Nicolas Anelka made it 2-1 in the 23rd with a close-range shot into the roof of the net.         
	Drogba has now scored 18 goals this season and Anelka has seven but Chelsea has conceded 10 goals in four games.         
	Villa rarely threatened apart from when Agbonlahor hit his eighth league goal of the season. United striker Wayne Rooney had plenty of possession but was below the form that brought him 11 Premier League goals so far this season.         
	United brought on Michael Owen, Dimitar Berbatov and Darron Gibson in search of a goal and continued to dominate without reward. Berbatov was unmarked in front of goal but completely missed Michael Carricks cross and Nemanja Vidic had a header blocked on the line.         
	United has 34 points to Chelseas 37.         
	Birmingham moved to within three points of Spurs with midfielder Lee Bowyer scoring for a 1-0 win over former club West Ham, Fulham drew 1-1 at Burnley and last-place Portsmouth equalised in the final minute for a 1-1 draw at Sunderland.         
	In the other games, Blackburn drew 0-0 with Hull and Maynor Figueroa scored from halfway to help Wigan to a 2-2 draw at Stoke. (AP)

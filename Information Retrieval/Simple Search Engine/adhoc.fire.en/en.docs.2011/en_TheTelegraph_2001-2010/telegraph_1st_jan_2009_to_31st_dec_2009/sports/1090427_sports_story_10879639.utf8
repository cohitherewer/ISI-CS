The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | McLaren likely to escape suspension
                                                   McLaren likely to escape suspension

	Manama: McLaren are expected to escape a suspension when the FIAs world council convenes in Paris to decide on an appropriate punishment for lying to race stewards earlier this month.         
	A points penalty, which would take the team into negative figures for the season, is believed to be the most likely option. McLaren have been summoned by the sports ruling body to answer five charges that they lied to race stewards in Australia and Malaysia  cheating Toyota out of third place  and procured world champion Lewis Hamilton into supporting that deception. The team have already been disqualified from the Australian Grand Prix and stripped of the points they won in that race, while sporting director Dave Ryan, to whom all blame was apportioned, has been sacked.         
	Ron Dennis, the former chairman of McLaren Racing, has also withdrawn from the sport, which was widely seen as an attempt to placate the FIA, with whom he has had a difficult relationship. A points penalty would cost McLaren prize money in the constructors championship  there is roughly $3 million (2.04 million) per place  but it would not break the team entirely.         
	It was reported in this newspaper earlier this week that agents acting on behalf of McLarens major sponsors had approached the FIA and Formula One Management, Bernie Ecclestones company, to say they were considering pulling out of the sport if the FIA gave McLaren a disproportionately large penalty or a race suspension. Such a scenario could well prove terminal for a company of well over 1,000 employees.         
	Mercedes, who own a 40 per cent stake in McLaren, also said this week that they could return to being solely an engine supplier in the sport.         
	With McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh having written to the FIA to offer an unreserved apology for his teams actions, he has effectively given the FIA carte blanche to do with his team as they see fit on April 29. Yet the team have also made strenuous efforts to distance themselves from the Dennis era by repeatedly trying to build relationships with the FIA.         
	The FIA, widely portrayed as a body intent on destroying McLaren, are now in the tricky position of having to uncover the truth about lie-gate and dispense justice without destroying one of the sports most valuable assets.The last thing Formula One wants or needs is a host of global brands pulling out.         
	From the safety cars and support vehicles supplied by Mercedes, to the millions of pounds that McLarens sponsors spend in the Paddock Club their departure would be a devastating loss. Nor do the FIA want to punish Lewis Hamilton, the sports biggest star, or his teammate Heikki Kovalainen, who has done nothing wrong.

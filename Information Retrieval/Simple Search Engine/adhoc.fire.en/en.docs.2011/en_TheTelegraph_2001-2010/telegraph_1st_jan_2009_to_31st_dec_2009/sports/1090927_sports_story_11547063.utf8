	Johannesburg: Mitchell Johnson sizzled with an unbeaten 73 as Australia began the defence of their Champions Trophy title with a 50-run win over a fighting second-string West Indies at New Wanderers Stadium here Saturday.         
	Riding on Johnsons maiden half-century coupled with skipper Ricky Pontings brilliant 79 Australia rattled up a challenging 275 for eight after sent in to bat.         
	Johnson, who came in at number eight, conjured up a crucial 70-run partnership for the eighth wicket with Brett Lee (25) to lift his team from the pits. The defending champions bowled out the West Indies for 225 in 46.5 overs.         
	For Australia, Nathan Hautritz, Peter Siddle, and Shane Watson snared two wickets each.         
	Windies opener Andre Fletcher played a fantastic knock of 54 and Travis Dowlin followed him with an equally impressive 55 to raise hopes of an upset but could not finish off the job for their team.         
	West Indies, who had lost their opening encounter against Pakistan, thus have been ousted from the tournament.         
	Fletcher and Dowlin put up a brave fight with a 86-run stand for the second wicket but their middle-order could not build on the start.         
	The partnership was broken after an unfortunate run out of Fletcher. Skipper Floyd Reifer (28) and Darren Sammy (20) put up a brief resistance.         
	Earlier, Johnsons fiery knock came at a time when Australia were staring an early fold of their innings after being reduced to 171 for seven.         
	Johnson came out all guns blazing and struck eight boundaries and three sixes, in just 43 balls to change the complexion of the game.         
	Australia were cruising at 85 for one, following first-ball dismissal of Shane Watson, as captain Ponting and Tim Paine batted beautifully against a depleted Windies side.         
	However, the Australian middle-order crumbled when their partnership ended with the wicket of Paine (33).         
	Bernard dismissed Paine to break the partnership and then accounted for Michael Hussey (6).         
	Ponting continued his good show as he cracked nine fours and a six during his 94-ball stay.         
	Left-arm spinner Nikita Miller dealt a big blow to the Australians by scalping Ponting in the 31st over.         
	Ponting gave a charge to Miller, misjudged the flight of the delivery and wicketkeeper Chadwick Walton stumped him.         
	Cameron White (4) and Callum Ferguson (20) soon joined their skipper back in the hut, leaving their team in serious trouble.         
	Miller was the most economical bowler for the West Indies as he gave away just 24 runs in his quota of 10 overs while taking two wickets. Roach (2/73) and Bernard (2/63) also took two wickets each.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni blames it on the bowlers
                                                   Dhoni blames it on the bowlers
                      
	Durban: The Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni blamed their narrow nine-run defeat against Delhi Daredevils on poor bowling in the death overs here Thursday.         
	Delhi batsman AB de Villiers struck a magnificent century, scoring bulk of the runs towards the end, to help his side set a challenging 190-run target for Chennai.         
	Matthew (Hayden) kept us in the game with his splendid innings. But I think death bowling was the difference. A score of 150-160 was gettable. I think they scored 20-30 extras runs, which can make a lot of difference in a Twenty20 game. A.B. de Villiers batted brilliantly, Dhoni said after the match.         
	Winning captain Virender Sehwag was all praise for his batsmen, who, he said, showed the world the kind of talent the side possesses.         
	Our batsmen showed how good this side is. Despite losing two early wickets, we posted a big score on the board, he remarked.         
	I knew they (Chennai) are good in batting, so I told my bowlers to put the ball in the right areas, Sehwag added.         
	A.B. de Villiers, adjudged the Man of the Match for his splendid 54-ball 105, said it was fun batting on a batsman-friendly pitch.         
	It was a good pitch to bat on. I enjoyed the bounce... It was nice to come down and bat. I need to keep up the form, he said. (PTI)

	Pattaya: Sania Mirza steamrollered Russian qualifier Vitalia Diatchenko 6-4, 6-0 to storm into the quarter finals of the $220,000 Pattaya Open tennis tournament here on Thursday.         
	In Rotterdam, Leander Paes and his Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy whipped Russian-Polish pair of Igor Andreev and Marcin Matkowski in straight sets to storm into the doubles semi-finals of the World Tennis Tournament.         
	The second seeded Indo-Czech pair hardly broke a sweat as they won their quarter final match 6-2, 6-1 in the euro 1445,000 hard court event.         
	Sania perhaps played her best tennis after her comeback from a wrist surgery and sent the Russian opponent packing in one hour and two minutes in her second round match.         
	The Russian, who had defeated third seeded Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia in the first round, surrendered meekly to her Indian opponent after the two held their serves till the eighth game of the first set.         
	Sania broke the Russian in the ninth game and then sealed the first set by holding her serve.         
	The Indian was at her ruthless best in the second set by winning all the six games, finishing off each game with ease.         
	The only game of the second set which saw some opposition from the Russian was the fifth one but Sania won it eventually, breaking her opponents serve.         
	Sania will next play sixth seeded Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand, who beat Neuza Silva of Portugal 6-3, 6-2 in another second round match.         
	Partnering Italian Mara Santangelo, Sania has also made it to the semi-finals of the doubles event here.         
	Paes and Dlouhy next play the winner of the match between French duo Arnaud Clement and Michael Llodra and the Austrian-Israeli pair of Julian Knowle and Andy Ram.         
	For Paes, it would be his third semi-final of the year and second with Dlouhy after the duo lost in the semi-finals of the Australian Open.         
	Partnering American Scott Lipsky, Paes had lost in the final of the Heineken Open in Auckland last month.           (PTI)

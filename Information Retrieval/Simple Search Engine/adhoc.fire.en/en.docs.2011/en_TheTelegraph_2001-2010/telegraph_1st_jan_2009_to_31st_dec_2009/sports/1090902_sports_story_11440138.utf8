The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rennedy owes it to Nakamura
                                                   Rennedy owes it to Nakamura
            A STAFF REPORTER                                 Rennedy Singh            Deepak Mondal            Mehrajuddin            Syed Rahim Nabi      
	Calcutta: Rennedy Singh did not like it when parallels were drawn between him and David Beckham after his free-kick against Syria on Monday. Come on! I did not bend it like Beckham. It was more like Nakamura, he said on Tuesday.         
	Rennedy has been a big fan of Shunsuke Nakamura, who now plays in Spain for Barcelonas city rivals Espanyol. When he was in Barcelona for the India camp, Rennedy wanted to fix a meeting with someone he is in awe of since the Japan internationals Celtic days.         
	I could not meet him. I tried to go to Espanyols new stadium during his official presentation. But it was too far from where we were staying, Rennedy said with a tinge of sadness.         
	Recollecting Mondays dream goal, Rennedy said the moment he hit the ball he knew he was on target. You wont believe it, but the moment I hit it I knew it was going in. I had been practising that for a long time. I consciously never looked at the defensive wall and was only focused on the ball. Just one look at the wall and then that sweet feeling of the right connect. You know what I mean.         
	The East Bengal midfielder also wore the captains armband against Syria in the group league. I enjoyed it. Now, back in club mode, Rennedy said he was not sure about playing in the IFA Shield right away. I have a slight injury in my calf muscle. I am going to the club tomorrow (Wednesday) and will have to find out about coachs plan.         
	Deepak Mondal said Indias victory would keep the 2011 Asian Cup preparations on track. A loss here would have affected everything Bob sir (Houghton) has planned for us. People were critical of our Barcelona trip. Now they will keep their mouths shut.         
	He said he would be available for Bagan in the IFA Shield. Yeah, I am ready for the club, he said.         
	Mehrajuddin Wadoo, who also made a return to the city on Tuesday afternoon, said it was a big victory for India. We are on right track. It has been proved once again, he said.         
	His East Bengal skipper Syed Rahim Nabi too was ecstatic. Great win for us. Its a team effort and we all played our part, he said.

                                                   Injury puts Clarke out   of India tour
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: With Michael Clarke still nursing a sore back, Cricket Australia (CA) Friday appointed Michael Hussey as the vice-captain of the 15-member squad for the forthcoming one-day International series against India starting October 25.         
	Besides Clarke, Australia will also be without regular wicketkeeper Brad Haddin, who continues his rehabilitation from finger surgery, according to a CA release. He had picked up the injury during the Ashes series.         
	Wicketkeeper-batsman Tim Paine, who did well in both the ODI series against England and the just-concluded Champions Trophy, has been named Haddins replacement. Callum Ferguson and Nathan Bracken will also miss the series due to knee injuries.         
	Opener Shaun Marsh has been brought back into the squad after recovering from a hamstring injury while rookie left-arm spinner Jon Holland, who is playing for Victoria Bushrangers in the ongoing Champions League Twenty20, has also been named for the India tour. Australia will play seven ODI matches.         
	Clarke is continuing his rehabilitation from a back sore and Hussey will be the vice-captain. Haddin continues his rehabilitation from finger surgery and Paine, following a fine ICC Champions Trophy, is selected as wicket keeper, CAs national selection panel chairman Andrew Hilditch said in the statement.         
	Hilditch said Holland has been rewarded for his fine showing with the Australia A team.         
	Holland is in the squad as we wanted to take the opportunity to give a young left-arm finger spinner exposure, both to the Australian team set up and Indian conditions.         
	He has impressed in the recent Australia A series against Pakistan and in his time at CAs Centre of Excellence.         
	If an opportunity arises on the tour we feel he will equip himself very well at the international level, he said.

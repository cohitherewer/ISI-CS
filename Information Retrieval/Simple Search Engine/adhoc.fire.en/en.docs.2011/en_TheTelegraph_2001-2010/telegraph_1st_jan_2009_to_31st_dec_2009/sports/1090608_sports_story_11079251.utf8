	Chennai: Bengal will meet Services in the first semi-final of the Santosh Trophy on Wednesday, while Goa will cross swords with hosts Tamil Nadu the next day.         
	In the quarter final league matches on Sunday, Goa hammered Maharashtra 5-0, while Services defeated Karnataka 1-0. In the match between Services and Karnataka, it was the former who started the game on an attacking note. But Shaji D Silva was guilty of missing the target on both the occasions. Services took the lead in the 28th minute. Karnatakas Naveen Babu brought down S Raleng inside the penalty box and Laldingliana made it 1-0 from the resultant spot kick.         
	Earlier, a hattrick by Mascarenhas helped Goa thrash Maharashtra. Bevan DMello opened the scoring in the 19th minute. Ten minutes later Bevan doubled the margin and 10 minutes before the lemon break, Mascarenhas took over. He completed his hattrick just before the full time.

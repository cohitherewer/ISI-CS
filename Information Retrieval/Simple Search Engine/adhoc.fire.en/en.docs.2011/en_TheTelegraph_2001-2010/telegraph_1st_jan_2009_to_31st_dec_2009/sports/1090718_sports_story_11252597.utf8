	Turnberry (Scotland): World number one Tiger Woods struggled to a 74 in Fridays second round at the British Open to miss the cut in a major championship for only the second time as a professional.         
	The 33-year-old American, hunting a 15th Major victory, suffered a torrid run either side of the turn before posting a five-over total of 145, a stroke outside the cut.         
	A heavy favourite to lift the Claret Jug for a fourth time, Woods was one under for the day for the first seven holes before winds of up to 25-mph (40-kph) blew him off track on Turnberrys Ailsa Course.         
	He dropped seven strokes in six holes from the eighth but partially recovered with back-to-birdies on 16 and 17 before getting up and down from just off the green to save par at the last.         
	I was one under after seven holes and right there in the championship and had a few tough holes in a row and couldnt get it back, Woods said.         
	I hit a couple of bad shots... It was just problem after problem. If I could have just played those holes well Id be fine, coming home downwind I could make some birdies coming home.         
	I didnt do that, hit some bad tee shots, a couple of bad iron shots, didnt get it up and down and kept making mistake after mistake, added Woods.         
	I birdied two of the last four (but) you cant make mistakes and expect to not only make the cut but also try and win a championship.         
	Tom Watson had another magical day, bouncing back from a dismal start and rolling in two impossibly long putts to share the midway lead with little-known Steve Marino.         
	The 59-year-old Watson played the final 10 holes at four-under for an even-par 70 that might have been even more impressive in the windy conditions than his opening 65.         
	Its as if the spirits are on my side, said Watson, who rolled in a 75-foot birdie at the 16th and a 45-footer at the final hole to pull even with Marino.         
	Marino shot 68 at treacherous Turnberry, and the two will start Saturday in the final group at five-under 135. Another old-timer, 49-year-old Mark Calcavecchia, will be right with them, one stroke back.         
	Woods needed a spectacular comeback just to make the cut. Two double-bogeys on the back side pushed him to six over for the day, seven over for the tournament and at least two strokes off the cut line with three holes left.         
	But never count out Tiger. He rolled in a birdie at the 16th to get one stroke back, and headed to a par-five 17th  the easiest hole on the course  needing another.         
	Woods opened with a disappointing 71 in much better conditions Thursday, trudged through the front nine showing no signs of making a move, then began to fall apart after the turn.         
	His tee shot at No. 10 sailed wildly into the tall grass far right of the fairway  a familiar problem both days  and it was clear he was in trouble when he struck a provisional tee shot.         
	Even with dozens of fans helping him look, Woods could only find someone elses ball, took a penalty for a lost ball and wound up with a double-bogey six.         
	Then, from the first cut of rough only 159 yards away, Woods shockingly wound up with another double-bogey 6. A ragged approach missed the green, a sloppy chip failed to stay on, and a missed putt from about 5 feet sent him tumbling into an even deeper hole.         
	Traditional Turnberry weather returned to wreck Gaganjeet Bhullars debut and the Indian risks missing the cut after a poor second round of seven-over 77.         
	With the traditional inclement weather returning to the Ailsa Course, many a golfer found their campaign in complete disarray and his early morning start proved a handicap for Bhullar, who totalled eight-over 148.         
	Watson had his troubles at the beginning. He followed a bogey-free Thursday with bogeys on five of the first seven holes  including four in a row. Just when it seemed he was fading away, the five-time Open champion bounced back with two birdies around the turn.         
	He closed with a real flourish. The long putt at No. 16 plopped right in the centre of the cup, prompting Watson to pump both fists.         
	The one at from the edge of the 18th green dropped, too, and Watson kicked his right leg with glee, hardly looking like a guy who would be the oldest major champion in golf history by more than a decade if he can hold it together for two more rounds.         
	Julius Boros was 48 when he set the record at the 1968 PGA Championship.         
	Calcavecchia, with his wife on the bag, got off to a 67-69 start. He won his lone major 20 years ago at Troon, right up the road from Turnberry.         
	With props to his father for sending along his passport, Marino looked right at home in his first Open appearance.         
	For most, this was a day for surviving.         
	First-round leader Miguel Angel Jimenez struggled to a 73 but wasnt too upset about it.         
	The ponytailed, cigar-smoking Spaniard got off to a grisly start  a 4-over 39 on the front - but held it together and joined the pack at 137.         
	Kenichi Kuboya had the lead for a while, but lost it  along with his ball  when an errant tee shot at No. 13 led to double bogey.         
	A 72 kept the Japanese golfer in contention among that crowded group at 137, which also included Ross Fisher (68) and Retief Goosen (70).         
	John Daly, who won at St. Andrews in 1995, made it to an Open weekend for the first time in four years when a 72 left him at 140. (AGENCIES)

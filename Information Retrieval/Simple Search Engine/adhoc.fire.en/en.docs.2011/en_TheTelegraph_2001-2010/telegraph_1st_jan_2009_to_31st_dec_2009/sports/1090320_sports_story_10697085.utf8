                                                   No issues with schedule: CAB
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Jagmohan Dalmiya is confident there will be no problems in hosting Kolkata Knight Riders seven matches within a span of 15 days.         
	Addressing a press conference on Thursday, Dalmiya admitted it was tough to host seven matches within such a short time, but the association has had enough experience in this regard which will come in handy.         
	It is tough, Dalmiya said. But we have successfully hosted Hero Cup matches, World Cup semi-finals and other major tournaments in the past. And probably going by that yardstick I feel there will be no problems in hosting the matches, he said.         
	It was learnt that the Eden is likely have its first IPL match on April 11 while the second and third matches will probably be held on April 15 and 16, respectively. The fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh matches are proposed on April 18, 22, 24 and 26, respectively.         
	Dalmiya also announced that all CAB members including the National Cricket Club (NCC) and the Society for Sports and Stadium (SSS) will get free tickets for two of the seven KKR matches.         
	Meanwhile, the CAB is likely to fine Ashok Dinda for his spat with Ranadeb Bose during the Vijay Hazare Trophy in Agartala. He may also be suspended for a few matches.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rain helps Aussies retain the trophy
                                                     Rain helps Aussies retain the trophy
                  Brad Haddin scored 88                     
	Brisbane: Australia Friday retained the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy after the crucial fifth and final ODI was called off due to heavy rain. The no result in the final match left the series tied 2-2.         
	The series-decider, which started five hours late due to rain, was first reduced to a 22-over affair and, put into bat, Australia made 168 for four thanks mainly to unbeaten half centuries from wicketkeeper Brad Haddin and Callum Ferguson.         
	New Zealands run chase was further delayed by rain and their target was revised to 156 from 20 overs but the match was eventually called off after the 14th over when the visitors were 123 for six, needing 33 off six overs with four wickets in hand.         
	Opener Martin Guptill was batting on 64 in the company of debutant Brendon Diamanti who was on 26.         
	New Zealand had won the first two matches in Perth and Melbourne. Australia, who retained the trophy by virtue of winning the last series between the two countries, made a comeback winning in Sydney and Adelaide. New Zealands run chase mainly revolved around a blistering 34-ball 64 not out by opener Guptill while his teammates came and went.         
	Australia achieved immediate success with Ben Hilfenhaus castling Brendon McCullum with the second ball of the day.         
	Not to be deterred by the early setback, Guptill and one-down Peter Fulton scored at a brisk rate to reach 38 for one from three overs.         
	Then began the New Zealand slide, mainly due to extravagant shots. Fulton top-edged Bracken to Ferguson and the next man in, Ross Taylor, fell to Mitchell Johnson going for a big shot in the fifth over.

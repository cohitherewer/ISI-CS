The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Obama an inspiration for Serena
                                                     Obama an inspiration for Serena
                  Serena Williams                     
	Melbourne: She may be a Jehovahs Witness and determinedly apolitical, but Serena Williams says she cant help but be inspired by the inauguration of Barack Obama.         
	Serena was happy to talk about the new US president, following her first-round win at the Australian Open Tuesday, although big sister Venus was far more reticent.         
	Serena said she saw some parallels between her and Venuss careers and that of Obamas. I definitely think myself and Venus have opened up a lot of doors, being the first African-Americans to do so much in tennis, she said.         
	Speaking after her impressive 6-3, 6-2 demolition of Meng Yuan, the nine-time Grand Slam winner added that she was taking a keen interest in events in Washington. While she didnt set the alarm and get up early to watch Obamas swearing in, she said she had recorded it so that she can watch it later.         
	This is an amazing moment in American history, she said. Even Monday, (in) the United States it being Martin Luther Kings birthday. To have his birthday and Obamas presidency fall so close to each other ... this morning I was watching on the TV before I went out to play, I looked at my arm and I literally had chill bumps. Im a big fan of African-American history, learning my roots so I can be a better person.         
	You just look at all the things that weve come through. Now to have this opportunity in less than 24 hours is amazing.         
	The two Williams sisters were brought up as Jehovahs Witnesses, a religion which does not allow its adherents to follow secular politics or cast votes in elections.         
	While Serena was happy to speak about Obama, Venus was reluctant to comment following her 6-3, 6-3 win over Germanys Angelique Kerber.         
	I really am not political at all  I dont take any political side, Venus said. I think its exciting that in America we can have a president ... or that we can have diversity.         
	Weve had a long history in America of, you know, in the past racial strife. My parents grew up in the South, things like that. So it is nice to see that diversity, I guess. I think he was the best candidate, so Im happy that the best candidate was elected, but I really am not a political expert  I know zero.         
	Serena said that she had followed Obamas political ascendancy. I didnt vote (in the US election) because I am a Jehovahs Witness  I try to stay politically neutral, dont get involved in worldly matters, she said.         
	Its easy for me because I was born and raised a Jehovahs Witness. For me, because I am black, seeing that (Obama) happen, I would be blind if I didnt take interest in it or I would be lying if I said I wasnt interested in what was going on. Obviously I am. Obviously I was listening to a lot of points that Obama was giving for his election.         
	Some of the things that he said in order to get elected was interesting. But it (being apolitical) is not a hard position for me to take. I mean, hopefully the right thing will happen but, you know, I think its an important position for me to take in my faith.

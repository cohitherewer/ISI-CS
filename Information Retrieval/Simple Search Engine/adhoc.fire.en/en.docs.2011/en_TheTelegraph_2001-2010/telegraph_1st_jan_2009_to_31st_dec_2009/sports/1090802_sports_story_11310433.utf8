                                                   No issues with ICC: Manohar
                      
	New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Shashank Manohar said that the Board would try to work out the best possible solution with the International Cricket Council (ICC) on the World Anti-Doping Agencys (Wada) anti-doping code.         
	We hope to work out the best possible solution thats mutually acceptable. There is absolutely no confrontation between the BCCI and the ICC on the issue and if anyone is trying to convey such a picture, that is wrong, Manohar said.         
	The BCCI has called an emergent working committee meeting in Mumbai on Sunday to discuss the Wada code.         
	Our players have concerns about the security and privacy aspects regarding certain clauses in the Wada code, Manohar said.         
	Manohar though evaded a reply when asked if the BCCI will let the ICC penalise Indian players for missing the deadline. (PTI)

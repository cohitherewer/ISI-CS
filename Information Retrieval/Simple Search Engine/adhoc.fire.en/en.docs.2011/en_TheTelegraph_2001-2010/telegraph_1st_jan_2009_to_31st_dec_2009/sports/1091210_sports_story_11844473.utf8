            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Virender Sehwag has stormed back into the top-five of the ICC rankings for Test batsmen by virtue of his superlative double-century against Sri Lanka in the third Test in Mumbai.         
	Sehwags 293 has catapulted him 14 places to the fifth position which he shares with Pakistan captain Mohammed Yousuf.         
	Sehwags Delhi teammate Gautam Gambhir leads the batting table with the Lanka duo of Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara at second and third. It is the first time since October 2006 that Sehwag has returned to the top-five.         
	Sehwag, who scored 491 runs from his four innings, gained 16 places after starting the series at the 21st position.         
	Zaheer Khan, who returned figures of six for 142 in the Mumbai Test, gained a valuable place that puts him inside the top-10.

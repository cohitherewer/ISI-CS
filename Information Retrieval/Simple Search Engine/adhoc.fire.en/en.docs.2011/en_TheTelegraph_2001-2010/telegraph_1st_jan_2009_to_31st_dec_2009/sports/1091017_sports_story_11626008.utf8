                                                   Clarke named T20 captain
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Michael Clarke was Friday appointed skipper of the Australian Twenty20 side, almost a month after incumbent Ricky Ponting quit the shortest format of the game to concentrate on Tests and one-day Internationals.         
	All-rounder Cameron White has been named Clarkes deputy. An excited 28-year-old Clarke said he would try to follow in the footsteps of Ponting.         
	I have learnt a lot from Ponting over the last few years and would continue to do so. Im really excited to lead Australia in the newest form of the game, Clarke said in a release.         
	Naturally, well target the ICC World Twenty20 in the Caribbean next year and I feel we have plenty of talent to genuinely mount a challenge in that tournament, he added.

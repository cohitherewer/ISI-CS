The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Captain more important, says Younis 
                                                   Captain more important, says Younis 
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan captain Younis Khan, apparently asserting his authority after the team won the World Twenty20 under him, said on Friday that the captain and players mattered the most in the teams performance and the coach and his support staff play a secondary role.         
	I have played domestic cricket as well in Australia and England and the concept is that the coach and others are there as a support staff to help out the players. But the decisions have to be made by the captain and he and the players have to perform for the team to win, Younis said.         
	The support staff is there to help the players and make things easier for players, he added. Younis made it clear that he had no issues with vice-captain Misbah-ul Haq or former captain Shoaib Malik and other players as reported by the media.         
	 I had discussions with Misbah and other players when we planned for the matches. It is not correct to say I didnt speak to Misbah for days.         
	Younis attacked former chief selector Abdul Qadir for not speaking the whole truth when the legendary spinner said that he should not have been in the World Twenty20 squad.         
	I think one must be very honest with oneself. I think Qadir has not spoken the entire truth, he has covered up a lot of things. He should have been more honest and forthright, Younis said.

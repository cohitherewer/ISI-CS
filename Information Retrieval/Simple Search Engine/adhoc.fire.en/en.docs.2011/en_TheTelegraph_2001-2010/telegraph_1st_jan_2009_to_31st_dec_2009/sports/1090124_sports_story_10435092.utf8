                                                   Karim: Happy with 7th win on the trot 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: For Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa there was a sense of dj vu in his teams seventh win on the trot following the 3-0 thrashing of Mumbai FC in the I-League here Friday.         
	On my first assignment as an overseas coach in 2001, my team started the season similarly with seven wins. After that we had a drawn match and then a loss, the Moroccan said after the win.         
	I am happy to repeat the 2001 performance. It (the winning run) has come after a long time. Its a personal thing, but it was a team challenge and the team did well.         
	Bagan had a poor start to the season, losing 1-2 to Mumbai FC at home in the season opener. But they ended the first half with six wins on the trot.         
	Bencharifa said the win at the Cooperage was good not only because it was the seventh successive, but because it also marks a positive start to the second phase of the I-League.         
	When you have a break, sometimes it is good, but not always. When a team is doing well, they would like to continue. Five weeks (for Federation Cup in Calcutta followed by rest) could have affected the team, he said.         
	It was a very tactical game. In the first half we defended well. We knew their gameplan, we knew it would be a physical battle upfront, we were prepared for it.         
	In the second half we still focused on defence, but the message was also to attack. We knew they play a lot of balls in the air and we didnt have the players to tackle that. Therefore we had to work more on the ground and we did that.         
	If you look at our three goals, all of them came from moves on the ground. And they were all scored by strikers.         
	Mumbai FC coach David Booth said: We did well to close them down in the first half but we didnt have the quality to hold them for long enough.

                                                   Sreevats rues missing century
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sreevats Goswami got an opportunity to play on Thursday against Tripura because of Sourav Gangulys unavailability. But the talented left-hander didnt miss the opportunity, top scoring for Bengal with a useful 74. He, though, expressed his disappointment at missing out on a century.         
	I am disappointed with myself for failing to build on my initial good work. But I am satisfied with our teams performance, he said. He was also of the view that the wicket wasnt really easy to bat.         
	Playing shots wasnt easy. Judging by that, we did a decent job. He also didnt forget to thank the selectors for giving him a chance.         
	My job is to play well. I am hopeful of getting more opportunities.         
	Manoj Tiwary, who performed well both with the bat and the ball (55 runs and two wickets), said he was well aware of the fact that he has been getting out in the 50s too often.

            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Favourites may find the going tough against horses who have been carefully nursed at the weights for the end-season coups. Thursday afternoon may see a number of them popping up in the six-event card. Beauty Of Man, for instance, may take all by surprise in the days feature event, the 1,100m Relevance Cup. The Jasbir Singh-trained colt had humiliated two smart sprinters  Areology and Artistical  early in the season. The horse returns to his favourite scurry after matching strides with some upper class sprinters. Pawan Sharma partners the topweighted colt.

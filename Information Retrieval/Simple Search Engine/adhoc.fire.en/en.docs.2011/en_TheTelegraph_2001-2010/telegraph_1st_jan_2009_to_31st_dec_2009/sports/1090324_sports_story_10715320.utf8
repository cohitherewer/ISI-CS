The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Speculation on KKR captaincy continues
                                                   Speculation on KKR captaincy continues
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: There was no announcement by the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) on the captaincy issue on Monday, the day after the franchises cricket manager John Buchanan told The Telegraph that he wanted to approach the captaincy issue a little differently and wanted to develop leaders.         
	However, speculation continued on the role Sourav Ganguly, Indias most successful Test captain and the Knight Riders captain in the inaugural edition of the Indian Premier League, would get to play.         
	If the Buchanan philosophy is taken forward, then he could look at the likes of New Zealand vice-captain Brendon McCullum, West Indies skipper Chris Gayle and possibly even Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla.         
	Its significant that Buchanan has kept open the possibility of coach Matthew Mott being the captain when the team is batting and rotating the captaincy when the team is fielding.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Benitez extends contract till 2014
                                                       Benitez extends contract till 2014
                  Rafael Benitez                     
	London: Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez ended speculation about his future by signing a contract extension on Wednesday that will keep him at the Premier League club until at least 2014.         
	My heart is with Liverpool so Im delighted to sign this new deal, the 48-year-old Spaniard told the clubs website. I love the club, the fans and the city and with a club like this and supporters like this, I could never say no to staying. I always made clear I wanted to be here for a long time.         
	Benitez arrived from Valencia in 2004 and despite failing to end their wait for the top-flight title stretching back to 1990 he has re-established Liverpool as a European powerhouse, winning the Champions League in 2005 and reaching the final two years later.         
	Last week Liverpool reached the quarter finals of the Champions League with a 5-0 aggregate rout of Real Madrid and on Saturday, Benitezs men thrashed Premier League leaders Manchester United 4-1 at Old Trafford.         
	It is wonderful news Rafa has made a long-term commitment to the club, American co-owner Tom Hicks told Liverpools website. Since he became manager he has been responsible for the great progress we have made.         
	I know he will continue to build on his achievements as he has a tremendous hunger and desire to bring more success to the club, success our fans and everyone connected with the club deserves.         
	As well as winning the Champions League, Benitez also lifted the FA Cup with Liverpool in 2006, but his time at Anfield has not always run smoothly.         
	In 2007 he fell out with Hicks and co-owner George Gillett after publicly criticising transfer policy.         
	Liverpools failure to challenge United and Chelsea for the title until this season has also frustrated the fans.

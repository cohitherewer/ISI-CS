The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bangla bat after delayed start
                                                   Bangla bat after delayed start
                      
	Kingstown: Tamim Iqbal and Imrul Kayes led Bangladesh to 36 for no loss against the West Indies in the first Test before persistent rain caused another stoppage at Arnos Vale on Thursday.         
	Rain wiped out the entire morning session before new Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza won the toss and chose to bat first under overcast skies.         
	Play eventually got under way 20 minutes after lunch but showers returned after an hour to stall the visitors progress. Imrul was unbeaten on 21 while fellow left-hander Tamim was 14 not out.         
	Bangladesh gave debuts to fast bowler Rubel Hossain and all-rounder Mahmudullah, both of whom appeared in the Twenty20 World Cup in England.         
	Four bowlers were used by new West Indies captain Floyd Reifer, with Tino Best, the most experienced player in the side, sharing the new ball with Kemar Roach, one of seven players making their West Indies debut.         
	Darren Sammy and Dave Bernard, two of only four West Indians with previous test experience, also had brief spells without success.         
	Reifer, who played the last of his four Tests in January 1999, said he was proud to be captain in the absence of the 13 leading players boycotting the Bangladesh tour in a contract dispute with the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB).

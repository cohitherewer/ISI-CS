	Gavaskar to chair MCA meeting  
	Mumbai: Sunil Gavaskar would chair the first meeting of the newly constituted cricket improvement committee of the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) here on September 16, informed Hemant Waingankar, MCA joint secretary.  
	The meeting comes in the wake of Mumbai captain Amol Mazumdars decision to play for Assam in the upcoming domestic cricket season. Mazumdar is on the verge of becoming the highest run-getter in Ranji Trophy as he is just 31 runs short of the record. Gavaskar has not held any post in the MCA after serving it for a brief period in the early 1990s as a co-opted member of the managing committee.      
	DDCA fiasco  
	New Delhi: Virender Sehwag, who has triggered a virtual players revolt against the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA), and DDCA president Arun Jaitley will be having a crucial meeting on Tuesday to try and resolve the issues raised by the senior cricketers.  
	Pele ire
    
	Rio de Janeiro: Brazilian football legend Pele has slammed the game in his homeland terming it as corrupt and unprofessional. The big problem in our football is corruption, lack of professionalism, said Pele. It is incredible that clubs with an immense fan base, such as Flamengo or Corinthians, still dont have their own stadium, something which any small-time European team has, Pele charged.  
	Player stabbed
    
	London: West Ham defender Calum Davenport underwent surgery on Saturday after he was stabbed at his home. The east London club said in a statement that Davenport and his mother were attacked on Friday night at the players home in Bedford. Davenport started seven of West Hams 38 Premier League matches last season.      
	Milan: Inter Milan defender Nicolas Burdisso confirmed that he will soon be signing for AS Roma. It is all done, Im a Roma player, Burdisso said on Saturday.        
	Greensboro: Jeev Milkha Singh fired a scintillating six-under 64 in the second round to grab a share of the 12th spot but compatriot Arjun Atwal failed to make the cut before darkness suspended play in the Wyndham Championship golf tournament here. Jeev, who was left stranded at one-under yesterday, picked up seven birdies against a lone bogey to take his two-day total to seven-under 133 at the Sedgefield Country Club here.      
	Shiv show  
	Zandvoort: Shiv Kapur brought home an improved card of two-under 68 to surge 19 places to tied 57th and make the cut after the second round of the KLM Open golf tournament here.

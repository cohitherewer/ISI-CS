The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Agassi, Graf take centre stage
                                                     Agassi, Graf take centre stage
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi during their exhibition match at the All England Club on Sunday. (AFP)                           
	Wimbledons historic Centre Court inaugurated a modern makeover as tennis legends Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf staged exhibition matches under a brand new retractable roof.         
	The new roof is part of a wider revamping of Centre Court at the All England Club, which now has an increased maximum capacity of 15,000, and more comfortable seating.         
	It is the roof, however, that will cheer Wimbledon players and fans across the globe who have long had to endure Londons famously wet summers playing havoc with the tournaments scheduling.         
	It has been designed to open and close in under 10 minutes, is translucent to allow natural light to continue to shine on the lawn, and has been fitted with floodlights.         
	Along with weather no longer being a barrier to tennis being played at Wimbledon, tournament officials have admitted that there is no cut-off time to finish a days play, meaning epic matches could turn into after-dark dramas.         
	On Sunday, former Wimbledon champions and couple, Agassi and Graf lost a mixed doubles match against retired former British No. 1 Tim Henman and Belgiums Kim Clijsters 6-7.         
	Then, fans witnessed a singles showdown between Agassi and Henman, a match that Agassi won 6-4 with a forehand down the line on his fourth match point. In the last singles of the day, Clijsters defeated Graf 6-4.

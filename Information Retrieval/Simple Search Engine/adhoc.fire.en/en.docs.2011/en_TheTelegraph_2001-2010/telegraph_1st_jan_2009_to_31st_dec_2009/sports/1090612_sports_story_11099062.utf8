                                                   Zaheer Khan: We have to take this momentum forward
    - Were clicking as a bowling unit, says the Team India spearhead           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	London: Just under two years ago, during the Test series, Zaheer Khan had been the MoM at Trent Bridge. On Wednesday, he bagged another MoM award there  this time in the World T20 match against Ireland.         
	In 2007, Zaheer had been rather emotional in a chat with The Telegraph after being adjudged the MoM (nine for 134). This time, he was more restrained while taking questions from the media (at Trent Bridge).               
	The following are excerpts         
	On being among the wickets in a big way (four for 19)         
	It feels great... Im playing after a long time and Im enjoying every bit of it... This was the second game for me and it was important that I pick up some wickets. Wickets at any level boost your confidence, so Ive definitely gained from this performance.         
	The left shoulder injury midway during the recent IPL         
	It was a narrow escape for me... It could have been worse... I was lucky to get away with missing just four weeks of cricket... I worked really hard on strengthening the shoulder, but some work still needs to be done. The good thing is that there is nothing major, no danger to the shoulder...         
	Having excelled in the 2007 Test at Trent Bridge         
	I enjoy bowling in England, especially on the Trent Bridge wicket... Theres always something for the fast bowlers... Its one of those things that you have favourite grounds... You have good memories and they help you perform better.         
	Bowling in England         
	The conditions are good for seamers, but in this format, you have to be on the button right from the start... Were clicking as a bowling unit, which is a good thing going into the Super Eight.         
	Team India and the Super Eight         
	You cannot really say anything in T20... Today, on a scale of 10, we might be 10, but each game is a new one and thats the way were looking (at the tournament)... We definitely have to do the right things... We have to take this momentum forward.         
	The IPL         
	It has definitely helped players... You can see someone like Rohit Sharma, the kind of form hes in. Its good that we played T20 for five weeks (in the IPL) before the World T20.         
	Teams level of motivation         
	Were in a World Cup and thats a big motivation in itself. Watching us play, our level of motivation would have been obvious... We hope to continue in the same manner.         
	Whether there are areas to improve         
	This T20 form is very unpredictable and one has already seen that when The Netherlands beat England. In T20, theres nothing like a weak opponent or a strong opponent. Any team can, on any day, beat the other. We just have to continue taking each game at a time and focus on that particular game... This is a team sport and somebody or the other will put his hand up (to be counted)...         
	Chris Gayle being fit for our first Super Eight match, on Friday         
	It will be good to take his wicket early, because hes a match-winner.         
	Looking ahead to Sundays clash against England         
	(Laughs) Im not looking that far ahead... If Im the MoM again, on Friday, then Ill be able to talk about it that day!         
	Having opted out of the inaugural World T20, in 2007         
	Its unfortunate that Id opted out, but it was the right decision at that time. Im happy to be part of Indias campaign in this edition.         
	Teams (general) strategy in the World T20         
	Its simple... To give ones best shot and play tough professional cricket... Were intending to win all games, not just two.         
	The bowling unit         
	As Ive said, were clicking... Everyone understands his role and everyone is chipping in with performances at the right time. Thats crucial for the team.         
	Finally, the role played by bowlers         
	Be it T20 or some other form, they have an important role, for the opposition has to be restricted.

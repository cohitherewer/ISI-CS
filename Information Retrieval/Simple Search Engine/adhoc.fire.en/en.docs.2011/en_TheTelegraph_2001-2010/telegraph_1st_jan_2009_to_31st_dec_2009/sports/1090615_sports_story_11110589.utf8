The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Another must-win tie for Indian women
                                                   Another must-win tie for Indian women
                      
	Taunton: The Indian women will cross swords with Sri Lanka in a must-win pool B encounter in the Womens World Twenty20 here on Monday.         
	India, who suffered a 10-wicket mauling at the hands of England in their campaign-opener, rode on leg-spinner Priyanka Roys five-wicket haul and Anjum Chopras gutsy batting to bounce back into contention by defeating Pakistan on Saturday.         
	Skipper Jhulan Goswami will surely expect another good knock from experienced opener Anjum, whose unbeaten 37 was the cornerstone of Indias win Saturday, but what is giving her sleepless nights is the failure of her batters to fire in unison.         
	Even a paltry target of 76 was looking stiff when India were struggling at 21 for three after five overs in Saturdays match and Anjum was candid enough to accept that the batters have to show more responsibility if the team are to qualify for the semi-final.         
	Wickets were falling like nine-pins, so it was a little tense. Fortunately the score wasnt too high and you could push it around for singles. You need matches like this  but not too often, Anjum said.         
	However, bowling is not a concern for India any more especially after the brilliant show in the last encounter. The new-ball pair of Rumeli Dhar and Jhulan Goswami are working well, while spinner Gouher Sultana is capable of getting some timely breakthroughs.

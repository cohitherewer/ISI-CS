            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Virender Sehwag Saturday said he was still not fit to play international cricket but hoped to recover fully from a shoulder injury before the start of the inaugural Champions League T20.         
	I am not able to throw the ball from the boundary. I am not yet fit for international cricket but good to play in domestic cricket, Sehwag said at a promotional event here.         
	I am playing the Irani Cup (as captain of the Rest of India side) but then I will be standing in the slips or close-in position  I am hoping I will be fit in time for the Champions League.         
	On his decision to step down as the captain of the Delhi DareDevils, Sehwag said: I tried for two years and we didnt qualify.         
	I thought my luck was not working and after three years who knows where Sehwag will go. Thats the reason I decided to give up the captaincy.

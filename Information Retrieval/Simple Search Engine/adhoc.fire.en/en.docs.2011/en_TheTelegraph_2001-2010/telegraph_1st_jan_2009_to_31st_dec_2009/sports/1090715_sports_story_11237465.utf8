The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan assistant coach puts in his papers
                                                     Bagan assistant coach puts in his papers
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT    
	New Delhi: Mohun Bagan assistant coach Satyajit Chatterjee submitted his resignation Tuesday and said he wont be available for the new season.         
	The former India captain said it was not possible for him to continue in his position under a coach who was junior to him.         
	I dont like the idea of being the deputy to a person who is junior to me in age, Chatterjee said without naming the current Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa. But I wont mind working under coaches like Subhas Bhowmick, Subroto Bhattacharya or Shabbir Ali as they are senior to me.         
	Chatterjee also said the ongoing row between Bhaichung Bhutia and Bagan should be resolved as soon as possible and that the footballer should be released to play for East Bengal.         
	We should consider Bhaichungs contribution to Indian football and allow him play wherever he wants to, Chatterjee said.         
	Although the former midfielder, who donned the Bagan jersey for 14 years, said there was no controversy behind his resignation, speculation was rife that he was not happy with the Bagan management.         
	Chatterjee, however, said he parted company with the club after talking to its officials. They all asked me to reconsider the decision but I had already made up my mind, Chatterjee said.

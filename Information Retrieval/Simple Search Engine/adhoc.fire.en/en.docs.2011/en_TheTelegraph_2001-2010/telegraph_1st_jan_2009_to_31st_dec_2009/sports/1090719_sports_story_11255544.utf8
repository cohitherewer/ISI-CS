The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Goggin zooms in front 
                                                   Goggin zooms in front 
                      
	Turnberry (Scotland): Six years after being blown away by Tom Watsons golf, Australian journeyman Mathew Goggin overhauled the eight-times major champion to grab the early lead in Saturdays third round at the British Open.         
	Amateur guitarist Goggin, who is yet to win on either the PGA or European tours, maintained his composure in tricky, shifting winds to card a one-under-par 69 on Turnberrys Ailsa Course.         
	He shrugged off two early bogeys with a homeward nine of two-under 33, birdies at the 11th and 17th giving him a three-under total of 207.         
	It was a very good round and I felt very comfortable, the 35-year-old Tasmanian said. I hit the ball well, drove the ball well.         
	The turning point for me was eight. I had birdied seven and then it looked like I was going to make a double bogey but I made a nice putt (from 12 feet) and then played quite well after that. The last 10 holes were really solid.         
	Goggin is now poised to eclipse his previous British Open highlight, the experience of playing in the company of Watson for the third round of the 2003 edition at Royal St Georges.         
	It was shocking just how good he was, he recalled of the American, who was then aged 53.         
	I mean, it was ridiculous. I played with him and Im thinking: Hes getting on in years and not playing so much and hes just smashing it around this golf course.         
	I was really impressed. He was really good to me and I had a really great experience.         
	Goggin has not won anywhere since the 1999 Omaha Classic on the satellite US Nationwide Tour but believes he learned valuable lessons at last years Memorial tournament.         
	He led the Jack Nicklaus-hosted PGA Tour event, which always attracts a strong field, for the first three rounds before finishing in a tie for second.         
	That was probably one of the steepest learning curves to me, just to realise how I wasnt relaxed and I got too quick, he recalled.         
	You start trying too hard as opposed to letting it come to you, so that was a big stepping stone for me as far as being comfortable in that sort of situation.         
	Even today (Saturday), I felt very relaxed and very comfortable and played quite well, so you just try and go out and try to do the same thing Sunday.         
	Two-time US Open champion Retief Goosen of South Africa is right in the mix, shooting a 71 that left him at 208. Lee Westwood of England is at 208, as well, after shooting 70. Englands Ross Fisher also moved to 3 under with two straight birdies before heading to the 18th hole.         
	Meanwhile, World no. 8 Henrik Stenson expressed criticism of the crowd barriers at the British Open on Saturday after his tee shot on the final hole hit a spectator and cost him a double-bogey six.         
	I think the metal fencing in the crowd is way too close to the landing area on 18 in these conditions, a frustrated Stenson said after carding a one-over-par 71 at a breezy Turnberry in the third round.

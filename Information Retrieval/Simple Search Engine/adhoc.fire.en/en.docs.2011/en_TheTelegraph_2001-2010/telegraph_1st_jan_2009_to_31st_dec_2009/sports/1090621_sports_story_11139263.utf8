                                                   Lin test for Saina
                      
	New Delhi: Shuttler Saina Nehwal survived a gruelling battle with Chinese opponent Lan Lu, to advance to the final of the Indonesian Open Super Series in Jakarta on Saturday.         
	Sixth-seeded Saina beat seventh-seed Lu 25-23, 21-19 to set up a title clash against Chinese third-seed Lin Wang in Sundays final.         
	World No. 3 Lin beat eighth-seed Xingfang Xie 21-19, 21-13 in another semi-final.         
	In an edge-of-the-seat match, which saw fortunes fluctuating between the two, it was Saina who held her nerves to emerge the winner. In the first game, Saina and Lu battled tooth and nail and were on even keel, moving from 13-13 to 23-23 before the Hyderabadi sealed the game.

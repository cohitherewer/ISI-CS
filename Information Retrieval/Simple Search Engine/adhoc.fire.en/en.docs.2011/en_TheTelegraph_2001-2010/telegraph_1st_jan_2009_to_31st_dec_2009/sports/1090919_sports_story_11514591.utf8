The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | EBs misery continues
                                                   EBs misery continues
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: East Bengals cup of woe overflowed at the Ambedkar Stadium on Friday when they went down to Mahindra United 0-2 in a Group IV Durand Cup quarter-final league match.         
	The victory took the Mumbai team into the semi-finals ahead of Shillongs Lajong FC on the basis of better goal difference.         
	This was an unprecedented fourth consecutive defeat for the red and gold brigade this season. So far, the Calcutta team have conceded 10 goals in four matches they have played and, during their Delhi sojourn, they failed to score any.         
	The defeat was also a big personal setback for the East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick, who was solely responsible for recruiting players at the start of the season.         
	East Bengal had their fate sealed midway through the second half when Mahindra striker Mohammed Rafi struck twice in a span of four minutes to leave the Calcutta team in a state of daze.         
	The match turned sour for Mahindra coach David Booth as he was told to leave the bench by referee Mohammed Kamil for apparently arguing with him over a decision.         
	Bhowmick, however, blamed his defence for the defeat. They played poorly and conceded silly goals. Things are not going to improve unless we find a good central midfielder, he said.         
	Teams         
	Mahindra United: Subhasis Roy Chowdhury; Denzil Franco, D. Ravanan, Lamine Tamba and Debabrata Roy; Steven Dias, NP Pradeep, Svetozar Mijin (Sushant Mathew, 58th ) and K Aseem (Paresh Shivalkar, 46th ); Sushil Kumar Singh (Thoi Singh, 66th) and Mohammed Rafi.         
	East Bengal: Arup Debnath, Harmanjit Singh Khabra, Govin Singh, Saheb Ali and Syed Rahim Nabi (Jibon Singh, 67th); Beingaichho Bekhokhei (Sanju Pradhan, 57th), Mehtab Hussain, Riston Rodrigues and Rennedy Singh; Subhas Singh and Sebastian Omar (Alvito DCunha, 76th).         
	Referee: Mohammed Kamil

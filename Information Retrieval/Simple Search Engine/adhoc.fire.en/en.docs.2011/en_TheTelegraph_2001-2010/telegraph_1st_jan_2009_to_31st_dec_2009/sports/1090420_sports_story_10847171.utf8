The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rahul or I dont have to prove a point: Sachin
                                                     Rahul or I dont have to prove a point: Sachin
    - Cricket isnt football and there cant be a fixed strategy           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin Tendulkar                                 
	Cape Town: Sunday morning saw Sachin Tendulkar formally launch a cricket website (cricdude.com), which has a fantasy play section, and then start readying for the flight to Durban. In between, he spoke briefly to The Telegraph.               
	The following are excerpts from what he said at the launch and during the one-on-one:               
	His thoughts on the multiple leaders concept         
	But weve always had players making suggestions and helping out with field placements... In fact, when I was in the deep yesterday (Saturday), I got my keeper (Mumbai Indians Pinal Shah) to make sure that the long-on and long-off were at the correct angles... Look, the moon has always existed, right?         
	Whether the coach/cricket manager could one day become the boss, thereby making the captain redundant         
	Its not about being the boss... Its about giving ideas and having a game plan.         
	John Buchanan trying to be an Alex Ferguson         
	Cricket isnt football, where you can take the field with a fixed strategy... In cricket, you may have to revise the game plan after every over...         
	Whether T20 makes a heavier demand on the mind         
	Dont think so... I mean, the team batting first has one target  score the maximum... Theres only one direction to take, which definitely isnt the case in Test cricket... Im not suggesting no planning is involved, but you dont have to do much (mentally).         
	Having opted out of the inaugural World T20 meet, in 2007, which was won by India         
	Thats because my body wasnt up to it and I felt it wouldnt be fair on the rest of the team if I went along without actually being a 100 per cent there.         
	Whether Saturdays outstanding (MoM award-winning) 59 not out, against the Chennai Super Kings, could make him reconsider not playing for the country in T20         
	No... Indias T20 team is settled and I dont wish to disturb it... Its not that Rahul (Dravid) or I are out to prove a point in this edition of the IPL... We dont have to.         
	[Dravid scored a classy 66 for the Bangalore Royal Challengers, an innings which fetched him the MoM award and his team an upset win over champions Rajasthan Royals.]         
	His hunger not diminishing         
	(Grins) Because Im still enjoying the game... Cricket, for me, isnt all about hundreds or five-wicket hauls... Its about enjoyment and contributing to the teams success... I like winning, not losing... If the hunger and the urge to be competitive isnt there, then theres no point playing sport... I love cricket, its in my heart, and take pride in playing for India.         
	Whether batsmen with a tighter technique would, because of the conditions, be more successful in the ongoing edition         
	I wouldnt say so... Probably the ones whore more innovative... Who explore options.         
	Saturdays upsets having straightaway thrown open edition No.2         
	Its too early to say that... T20, though, can surprise and surprise big...         
	Statistics being a yardstick for judging cricketers         
	Its a reflection of ones contribution, yes, but stats alone dont matter... Enjoyment does... I dont really keep track of the stats of others, but do remember mine... What I got where and how I got out.         
	Whether hes into computer games and such like         
	Not really, but my son (Arjun) is teaching me a few things... Also, its only rarely that I go to websites.         
	Finally, on the Kolkata Knight Riders captaincy being taken away from good friend Sourav Ganguly         
	(Grins) Dont know what happened... The developments began when we were in New Zealand, so I wouldnt like to comment.

	Hong Kong: Ace golfer Jeev Milkha Singh leads a strong Indian challenge of 10 players in the UBS Hong Kong Open which tees off here Thursday.         
	Jeev, the reigning Asian Tour Order of Merit title holder, may not have played much in Asia, but he is one of the top draws in the $2.5 million event at the Hong Kong Golf Course.         
	Aiming to back into the worlds top-50 rankings, Jeev with a good show here, will tee up with Lee Westwood and defending champion Lin Wen-Tang of Chinese Taipei in the first two rounds. Eight of the 10 strong Indian contingent, including Jeev, have won in the Asian Tour.

                                                   Interesting contest on the cards
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Teams from Goa and Maharashtra are expected to dominate the final round of the Second Division I-League beginning in Gurgaon from Tuesday.         
	With the All India Football Federation (AIFF) making it official that four teams will qualify for the I-League next season to make it a 14-team affair, the six-team round robin league at the Devi Lal Stadium could well turn out to be an interesting battle.         
	Two of the six teams  Salgaocar and Sesa  are from Goa and are perfectly capable of swelling the number of teams from the state in the Premier Division. If these two teams manage to make the grade, then there will be five teams from Goa in the I-League.         
	Two other teams  ONGC and Pune FC  are from Maharashtra, yet another indication of the states growing influence in Indian football. Three Mumbai teams  Mahindra United, Air India and newly-formed Mumbai FC are already there in the I-League and are doing reasonably well.         
	There are also Viva Kerala and Lajong FC from Shillong, a surprise entry in the final round. But then, they played creditably in the preliminaries and defeated strong contenders ONGC in the concluding encounter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wright praise for Kirsten 
                                                   Wright praise for Kirsten 
                      
	Hamilton: Former India coach John Wright reckons Gary Kirsten a better motivator than himself and feels Mahendra Singh Dhonis men have what it takes to become the top team in both Tests and one-dayers.         
	Oh, hes (Kirsten) probably better. Well, I know he did score more runs than me. He is very thoughtful and very passionate and I think he understands the importance and the privilege of coaching India, said Wright, who was Indias coach from 2000 to 2005.         
	And you have to understand how things work. You bring some ideas from outside India but there is also an understanding of how things are best handled, getting to know your players and keeping them contented and happy and confident. Being able to correct them when they need to, Wright told reporters.         
	Wright, currently a New Zealand selector, also felt that the support staff that works with Kirsten has given the team a professional approach.         
	Every coach is a little bit different, but him and Paddy (Upton) and of course Robin (Singh) and Venky (Venkatesh Prasad), the whole support team looks very professional.           (PTI)

	Cape Town: Anil Kumble bowled a crafty spell of leg-spin to complement Rahul Dravids outstanding 66 off 48 balls as Royal Challengers Bangalore stunned defending champions Rajasthan Royals here Saturday.         
	Rajasthan were dismissed for just 58, the lowest score in the Indian Premier League and the second lowest score in the history of Twenty20 cricket. When the Bangalore side scored only 133 for eight batting first, nobody fancied their chances against Shane Warnes men but Kumbles spell of fiver for five runs turned the tables on the Royals.         
	The top score for the Royals was 11. While three batsmen were dismissed for that score, others could not reach double figures.         
	Kumble, who retired from international cricket earlier this year, picked up the wickets of Yusuf Pathan, Ravindra Jadeja, Warne, Munaf Patel and Kamran Khan after Praveen Kumar had Graeme Smith and Swapnil Asnodkar caught by Dravid and Virat Kohli respectively, to reduce the Royals to seven for two. They could never recover from those setbacks.         
	Earlier, Dmitri Mascarenhas ripped apart the Royal Challengers top-order before Dravid hit a fighting 66 to lead his team to a modest 133. The England all-rounder wreaked havoc with a three-wicket haul as the Royal Challengers found it extremely hard to recover from the disastrous start.         
	Dravid led the Bangalore fightback with his third IPL half-century. New captain Kevin Pietersen (32) was the only other batsman who put up some resistance. Dravid, who led the team in the first edition of the Twenty20 tournament, defied all the odds to ensure his team remained in the hunt. His 48-ball innings was studded with eight fours and a six.         
	Royals skipper Warne (2/18) and Munaf Patel (2/25) shared four wickets between them. Mascarenhas provided a sensational start to the holders, scalping two wickets in the very first over of the game.         
	Mascarenhas struck on the second ball of the innings, having New Zealand batsman Jesse Ryder caught behind and then had the stumps of his compatriot Ross Taylor rattled off the next ball.         
	Without a single run on the board, the Bangalore team had lost two of their most destructive batsmen. Robin Uthappa was back in the hut soon after, when the flamboyant batsman, attempting a big shot, holed out to stumper Mahesh Rawat off Mascarenhas.

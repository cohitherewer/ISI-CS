The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | National selectors to resume tours
                                                     National selectors to resume tours
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Srikkanth                           
	Calcutta: No selector accompanied Team India on the recent tour of Sri Lanka, but the trend started by the Sharad Pawar regime (in 2005-06) hasnt been scrapped by the current dispensation, headed by Shashank Manohar.         
	Indeed, The Telegraph learns that the Krishnamachari Srikkanth-chaired committee will, by rotation, be on duty from within a fortnight.         
	An announcement from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is, however, awaited.         
	The last time that any selector accompanied Team India was during the July-August 2008 tour of Sri Lanka.         
	It was a different committee then, with Dilip Vengsarkar at the helm.         
	One understands Narendra Hirwani and Surendra Bhave will set the ball rolling by heading to New Zealand, though they may miss the first three ODIs. The T20 series is, of course, already over.         
	Theyll remain there till the end of the tour, which is April 7.         
	Next, Srikkanth and Raja Venkat are (as of now) set to watch the ICC World Twenty20 in England. That tournament is from June 5-21.         
	The inaugural edition, in September 2007, had been won by India.         
	Once the World T20 is over, Team India will be off to the West Indies for a four-match ODI series. Yashpal Sharma and either Hirwani or Bhave are expected to do duty there.         
	Unless a change is effected, the Mahendra Singh Dhonis will board a Caribbean-bound flight from London itself. As things stand, barring Sachin Tendulkar, the other players are common to both the T20 and ODI line-ups.         
	The ODIs in the West Indies (worked out via an arrangement between the BCCI and the West Indies Cricket Board in 2006-07) have been scheduled in the period June 26-July 5.         
	Srikkanth and Co., one learns, have done the rotation amongst themselves. Approval by the BCCI is a formality.         
	The current committee is the first comprising paid selectors. Theres no indication, however, that (beginning with the New Zealand assignment) those on tour will actually have a bigger role than simply being observers.         
	Surely, an enhanced role would be more meaningful.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rooney takes on central role 
                                                   Rooney takes on central role 
                      
	Almaty (Kazakhstan): Wayne Rooneys deployment in his favoured central role for England could be key to the countrys move to the verge of World Cup qualification at Kazakhstan on Saturday.         
	Rooney has spent much of the season with Manchester United playing on the left of an attacking trio, but is likely to play in Almaty in the position in which he forged his reputation. The position I play for England is the one I like playing most, Rooney said.         
	The 23-year-old Rooney has hit seven goals in his last five internationals but has needed 19 games to record the same for United. A victim of his own versatility and improved discipline, Rooney is often forced out of his favoured position by Cristiano Ronaldo.         
	But with England seeking a sixth straight qualifying win, Rooney is likely to start as a deep-lying forward behind Emile Heskey or Peter Crouch, and swap with Steven Gerrard on the left of midfield .         
	When youre playing out on the left, you have responsibilities to get back and defend, Rooney said. Sometimes that does take away a bit of energy from your attacking. But with England you can get your rest at times by swapping with Steven. That allows you to get forward as well.

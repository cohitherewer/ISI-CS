  - East ignored as bcci names specialised coaching centres         OUR CORRESPONDENT                            
	Mumbai: The BCCI, at its working committee meeting on Thursday, decided to increase the Ranji Trophy winners purse to Rs 2 crore.         
	The inter-zonal Deodhar Trophy, however, would not be played this year as the members approved without change the domestic calendar finalised by the tours, programme and fixtures committee.         
	The Boards working committee, which met at the Cricket Centre for the last time before the annual general meeting next month, approved the increase in prize-money for the premier domestic championship which will now see the runners-up taking home Rs 1 crore and the semi-finalists Rs 50 lakh each.         
	Earlier, the Ranji champions bagged Rs 60 lakh.         
	Also in for a bonanza were the Emerging India squad members who have been rewarded with an incentive of Rs 1 lakh each following their triumphant return from Down Under where they played a quadrangular tournament last month.         
	The omission of the Deodhar Trophy had created a furore a few weeks ago, forcing the BCCI to come out with an assurance that the Board would try and squeeze in the tournament.         
	Surprisingly, the matter was hardly debated upon during Thursdays working committee meeting.         
	The first report (of the tours, programme and fixtures committee) was passed as it is by the working committee, a source said.         
	The working committee also approved setting up of specialised coaching centres in Mumbai (batting), Mohali (fast bowling) and Chennai (spinners and wicketkeepers).         
	Surprisingly, East Zone remained ignored in the setting up of these specialised centres. Nothing unusual though, given the current regimes apathy towards the zone.         
	These specialised coaching centres will start functioning from September. Specialist coaches will be appointed on an annual retainership basis at each of these centres.         
	Meanwhile, the working committee, as expected, approved the IPL franchises signing up those players who had joined the unauthorised Indian Cricket League but availed the BCCIs amnesty offer to come back to mainstream cricket.         
	The working committee clarified that the players who were yet to be cleared of match-fixing charges would not be welcome, though.         
	Punjab middle-order batsman Dinesh Mongia and former New Zealand all-rounder Chris Cairns are the two players who were allegedly involved in match-fixing in the ICL.         
	The BCCI also approved the financial assistance to the All India Football Federation. The Rs 25 crore grant would be given over a period of two years.               
	The other decisions:               
	The BCCI nominated Amish Saheba and Shavir Tarapore to the ICC international umpires panel while naming Sanjay Hazare as the TV umpire.         
	The working committee approved the setting up of an umpires academy in principle.         
	The match fees for umpires were also approved  domestic matches (except IPL) Rs 7,500 per match-day out of which Rs 3,750 will be contributed to the benevolent fund. The umpire coaches and Match Referees (except IPL) will be paid Rs 10,000 per match-day.

	 Karachi: Pakistans former cricketer and fielding coach Ijaz Ahmed, charged and arrested for an alleged fraud, was finally released on bail by the Lahore High Court on Tuesday.         
	I was disappointed at the way my earlier bail applications were rejected but at least now I have got some relief. I am innocent in this case these are all false charges against me, he said.         
	Pitch penalty         
	 London: Glamorgan were penalised after a pitch at their Sophia Gardens home ground in Cardiff, the venue for the first Ashes Test between England and Australia in July, was rated poor. An England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) pitch panel upheld the umpires decision that the pitch had demonstrated excessive turn and should therefore be rated poor. Glamorgan were penalised two points on Monday, but the penalty wont be applied this season.         
	Strauss upbeat         
	 Chester-le-Street: Andrew Strauss, the England captain, believes the hunger his new-look side have shown in two crushing Test victories over the West Indies augurs well for this years Ashes. If you look at the way the guys are practising at the moment, theres a real hunger to improve and we need to cultivate that and make sure it grows and grows, the opening batsman said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Italy, France eye 2010 Cup berths 
                                                   Italy, France eye 2010 Cup berths 
                      
	Paris: Reigning champions Italy and 2006 runners-up France can train their thoughts firmly on reaching the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa if successful in qualifiers in the next few days.         
	France have a double-header against Lithuania on Saturday, away, and then on Wednesday in Paris, while Italy travel to Montenegro before a top-of-the-table clash against Republic of Ireland in Bari.         
	Coach Raymond Domenech, whose performance is still under the microscope from a demanding French media, leads his side in Kaunas on Saturday with the aim of shoring up their weakness in defence facing freekicks.         
	Central defender Philippe Mexes has battled back after his disastrous showing in the 3-1 defeat to Austria in September last year, when he was at fault for all three goals, and when Frances defensive frailty was exposed.         
	Conceding goals from free-kicks has cursed France since the World Cup final, having let in 14 out of 30 since the defeat to Italy on June 13, 2006.         
	Serbia lead Group Seven from Lithuania, both on nine points from four matches, while France are third with four points from a match less. Romania host Serbia in the other game in the pool.         
	Italy coach Marcello Lippi gave a hint as to his starting team for Saturdays match in Montenegro by separating 11 players from his squad to work alone in midweek training.         
	The team comprised goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, centre-backs Fabio Cannavaro and Giorgio Chiellini, full-backs Gianluca Zambrotta and Fabio Grosso, midfielders Andrea Pirlo, Daniele De Rossi and Angelo Palombo and forwards Vincenzo Iaquinta and Udinese pair Antonio Di Natale and Fabio Quagliarella.         
	If that is indeed Lippis first choice team it means he will be adopting a 4-3-3 formation with Quagliarella and Di Natale flanking Iaquinta up front.         
	Meanwhile, England face Slovakia at home in a friendly on Saturday. (Reuters)

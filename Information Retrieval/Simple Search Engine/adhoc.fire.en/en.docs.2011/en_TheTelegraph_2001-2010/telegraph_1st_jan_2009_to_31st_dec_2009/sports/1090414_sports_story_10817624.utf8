                                                   Gambhir: No qualms about batting order
                      
	New Delhi: Team India opener Gautam Gambhir has no qualms about batting at any position as far it contributes to a win.         
	It will be completely on the team management where I should bat, whether I open or not, Gambhir said. It is not important where you bat but whether your team wins at the end, he said on the sidelines of a function on Monday.         
	Asked if he was tired after the New Zealand tour, Gambhir said: There is no need to take rest in this profession. This is the time I should be active because a player has a limited time in his career. Moreover, I cannot forget the love and support given to me by so many people. This profession is not for resting, he said.           (PTI)

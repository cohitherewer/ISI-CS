                                                   EB thrashed by Churchill
                      
	Margao: Title aspirants Churchill Brothers scored a convincing 3-1 victory over East Bengal in an I-league match at the Nehru Stadium, here on Sunday. Churchill, who led 1-0 at half time, scored through Odafe Okolie (33rd, 74th) and Ogba Kalu (47th). East Bengal reduced the margin in the stoppage time through Yusif Yakubu.         
	After Sundays win, Churchill remain on top of the table with 42 points from 20 matches, three points clear of their nearest rivals Sporting Clube de Goa.         
	Churchill were on the offensive mode right from the word go with swift change of flanks and kept the rival defence under pressure. Odafe tested the rival custodian Abhra Mondal with two long rangers, which missed the target by inches.         
	The East Bengal citadel nearly fell in the 17th minute when Felix Chimaokwu gave a pass to Khanthang Paite whose left footer hit the bar.         
	Churchill took the lead in the 33rd minute. Felix set up Odafe who was seemingly off-side. The rival defenders hesitated to tackle allowing Odafe to move up and get the better of an onrushing Mondal before slamming the ball into the net.         
	Churchill increased the lead in the 47th minute. Felix sprinted down the right and, after beating defender Nirmal Chetri, sent a cross into the box for Ogba Kalu who tapped in.         
	Odafe, who was unlucky to see his power-packed shot hit the post from top of the box, scored his second in the 74th minute to put the match beyond the reach of East Bengal. He dribbled past a couple a rival defenders before finding the back of East Bengal net with a stiff grounder.

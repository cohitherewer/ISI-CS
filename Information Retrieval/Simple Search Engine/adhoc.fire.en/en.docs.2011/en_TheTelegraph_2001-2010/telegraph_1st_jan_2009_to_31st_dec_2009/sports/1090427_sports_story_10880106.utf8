	Port Elizabeth: Fridays return match against the Mumbai Indians, in East London, will be Chris Gayles last for the Kolkata Knight Riders in edition No.2 of the IPL.         
	Gayle is the West Indies captain and has to report in London on May 2.         
	The West Indies tour of England begins on May 2 and Ive got to reach London that day... So, I wont be returning to the West Indies, but joining the team directly, he told The Telegraph.         
	Gayles departure is bound to hurt the Knights, but the franchise is hopeful that Australian David Hussey, who joins on May 8, will make a big impression.         
	Meanwhile, Wriddhiman Saha has resumed full-fledged nets and the Knights expect him to be available for selection within a few days.         
	If all goes well, the keeper could be considered for Wednesdays match (in Durban) against the Bangalore Royal Challengers... Lets see, a member of the Knights management said.         
	Saha, it may be recalled, underwent surgery on his left thumb during the camp in Bloemfontein. Hed been struck by state-mate Ashok Dinda while batting.

	New Delhi: Former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar doubts if Mahendra Singh Dhonis men would be mentally fit and fresh for the World Twenty20 after the recent Indian Premier League (IPL), which he fears could cause an overkill for India.         
	The Indian players are now in a situation where they play two high-pressure Twenty20 tournaments, back-to-back. Thats never ideal, Vengsarkar said.         
	Its the job of administrators to ensure that the players are fresh and ready. Otherwise, there is the possibility of a cricket overkill in India, he was quoted as saying by a website.         
	The former batsman felt coach Gary Kirsten would require to lift the tired-looking Team India in time for their first warm-up game at Lords against New Zealand on June 1. Its a big challenge for Kirsten and his support staff to manage this task. I hope they can pull it off because resting the players completely cant also be done at this point of time, he said.         
	The former chief selector advised the BCCI to revise the schedule and format of the IPL so that players could remain fit for international commitments.         
	The IPL schedule is simply too long and I feel very strongly about it. It affects the fitness and form of players for major international events.         
	And there are always chances of mental fatigue creeping in. One possible solution is to have 10 teams in the IPL playing nine matches each for a maximum of around 25-30 days, he added.

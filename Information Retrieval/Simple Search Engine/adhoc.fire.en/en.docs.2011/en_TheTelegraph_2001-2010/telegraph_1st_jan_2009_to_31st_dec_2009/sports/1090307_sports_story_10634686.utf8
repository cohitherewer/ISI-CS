	London: The former Honda Formula One team has been saved and will race this season as Brawn GP under new owner Ross Brawn, the renamed team said in a statement on Friday.         
	Britains Jenson Button and Brazilian Rubens Barrichello, last years Honda line-up, will continue to drive for the British-based team with the first race in Australia on March 29. Brawn GP, whose change of name is subject to the agreement of the governing FIA, will use Mercedes engines under a deal with McLarens partners.

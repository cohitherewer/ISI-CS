The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Beckham earns England recall
                                                     Beckham earns England recall
            THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            David Beckham                           
	David Beckham, who has made more comebacks for his country than Peter Mandelson, has been given yet another opportunity to resurrect his England career after Fabio Capello last night confirmed his recall to the national squad for Wednesdays friendly international against Spain.         
	His selection means he will have the chance to make history in Seville, by equalling Bobby Moores record of 108 caps for an outfield player  a reward for his resurgent form since he joined AC Milan on loan from Los Angeles Galaxy.         
	Capello left Beckham out of his squad for Englands last match in Germany in November because of his lack of match-fitness in what was the off-season for the American league, but the Italian has been impressed by the 33-year-olds physical condition since his introduction to Serie A.         
	Beckham is a very important player and his form is OK now, said Capello. I watched him in one game in Milan and Italo Galbiati and Franco Baldini saw his other games, and now he is fit. Every player in the squad has to be playing, not only training.         
	Beckhams call-up is vindication of his decision to go on loan to the Italian giants.         
	The absence of the injured Theo Walcott means Beckham is likely to start against the European champions in a match Capello hopes will provide an important test as England attempt to build on their 2-1 win in Germany and their 100 per cent record in their World Cup qualifying games.         
	England will be without Wayne Rooney following his three-week lay-off with a hamstring injury. Capello looks certain to start with the new Aston Villa strike partnership of Emile Heskey and Gabriel Agbonlahor.         
	Meanwhile, Los Angeles Galaxy have rejected AC Milans first offer for David Beckham, the Italian clubs chief executive Adriano Galliani said on Saturday.         
	The 33-year-old England midfielder is on loan at Milan until March 9 but has said he wants to stay with the Serie A team permanently.         
	We made an offer to Galaxy which they have not accepted, Galliani said at Milans home league game with Reggina. For now we are a long way apart but there is still a month to go, he added without going into details about the offer.         
	For technical reasons Beckhams loan is actually until June, meaning Milan can talk to Galaxy outside of the transfer window which closed last Monday.         
	However, there is a written agreement that he goes back to the US in March.         
	The Galaxy have said Beckham will return to Los Angeles as scheduled unless Milan come up with a substantially higher offer.

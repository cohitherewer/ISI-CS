The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sri Lankans chickened out: Chetan Chauhan
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sri Lankans chickened out: Chetan Chauhan
                  Chetan Chauhan                     
	New Delhi: Sri Lanka chickened out of the fifth and final ODI against India fearing defeat and Match Referee Alan Hurst unnecessarily called off the match, an unrepentant Delhi and Districts Cricket Association (DDCA) alleged Monday.         
	DDCA vice-president and former Test player Chetan Chauhan claimed that while it was still being considered whether it would be wise to carry on, Hurst told him unofficially that the Lankans, who were reeling at 83 for five at that stage, were reluctant to carry on.         
	The Match Referee told me unofficially that one side did not want to carry on and he could not force them. It could not be India since (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni was willing to continue. Sri Lanka were at 83 for five and thats why they backed out... It was the Sri Lankans who chickened out, a defiant Chauhan told a TV news channel.         
	Training guns on Hurst, Chauhan said the Match Referee had erred in calling off the game.         
	I dont think the match would have been called off had it been in Australia or South Africa. Had the pitch been dangerous for play, the match would have been called off inside five overs It couldnt have gone on till the 24th.         
	I agree this (the pitch) was not ideal for international matches but neither was it unplayable or dangerous, Chauhan wondered.         
	We offered another wicket and said give us one hour and you would have it ready. But Hurst decided to call it off.         
	The match should have continued because some 45,000 people were at the ground and another 2-3 crore were glued to their TV sets. Only nine out of the 130-odd deliveries had either low or above-normal bounce and that doesnt qualify the match for cancellation. An honest effort should have been made to save the match, Chauhan said.         
	However, later, talking to reporters after an executive committee meeting at DDCA president Arun Jaitleys house, Chauhan toned down his stand and hoped ICC, which has sought an explanation from BCCI on the fiasco, would see that it was merely an accident.         
	We are absolutely sure that the ICC would realise that it was a genuine mistake, an accident and not something deliberate, he said.         
	Chauhan also passed the buck on to the Daljit Singh-led BCCI grounds and pitches committee, which was disbanded Sunday.           (PTI)

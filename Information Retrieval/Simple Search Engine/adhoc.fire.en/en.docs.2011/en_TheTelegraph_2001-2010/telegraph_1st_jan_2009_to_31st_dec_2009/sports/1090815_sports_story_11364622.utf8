	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India will organise a seminar on August 26 in Mumbai to develop awareness about doping in cricket. The seminar will be attended by 27 physios from across the country.         
	National Cricket Academys head coach, education and sports science, Kinjal Suratwala and Team India physio Nitin Patel will be conducting the seminar. Suratwala, who is supervising an A-level refresher course for East Zone coaches at the Eden, said: We will be instructing on the various drugs, the pharmacy rules and the exemptions as specified by the Wada.         
	He also revealed that the NCA was planning to publish coaching manuals in Hindi to overcome the language barrier, which is often a problem for domestic coaches. As part of new plans, the B and C level coaches will be provided with an internship at the NCA from this season.         
	The NCAs website has been upgraded and has been made more interactive. Chairman Ravi Shastri will be answering three queries of coaches every month, he said.

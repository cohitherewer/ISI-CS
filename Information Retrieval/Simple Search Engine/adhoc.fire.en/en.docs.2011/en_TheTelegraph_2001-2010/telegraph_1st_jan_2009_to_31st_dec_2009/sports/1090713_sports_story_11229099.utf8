	Ostrava: Argentina were dumped out of the Davis Cup in the quarter finals on Sunday following a 3-2 defeat by the Czech Republic.         
	Juan Martin del Potro had ensured the tie would go down to the wire by beating Tomas Berdych 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to level the match at 2-2 but Radek Stepanek condemned the 2008 runners-up to an early exit with a 7-6, 6-3, 6-2 win over Juan Monaco.         
	The Czechs will face Croatia in the semi-finals in September. The Czechs, beaten 5-0 by Argentina in their last encounter in 2005, won their only Davis Cup title in 1980 when they were still part of Czechoslovakia.         
	Croatia defeated the United States when Marin Cilic beat James Blake 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 on Sunday in Porec in the first reverse singles.         
	On Saturday, Croatia led the US 2-1, after American twins Bob and Mike Bryan won the doubles.         
	In Tel Aviv, Israel already through to their maiden Davis Cup semi-finals on Saturday with a 3-0 score, beat Russia 4-1.         
	On Sunday, after Dudi Sela retired during the first reverse singles against Igor Andreev, Harel Levy got the better of Igor Kunitsyn in three sets, 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (7-2).         
	In Marbella, Philipp Kohlschreiber has made it tougher for Spain in their first reverse singles on Sundaym, after defeating Fernando Verdasco 6-4, 6-2, 1-6, 2-6, 8-6. The two teams now stand at a level 2-2.         
	On Saturday, Verdasco and Feliciano Lopez beat Nicolas Kiefer and Mischa Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (7-1), 6-7 (6-7), 6-3 in 30-degree (86 F) heat to retake the lead against Germany.         
	Verdasco saved a match point at 5-3 down in the final set but Kohlschreiber, who beat Tommy Robredo on Friday, steadied himself and converted his second in the 14th game with a return winner down the line.         
	With the final singles to come in the best of five clash, the Spaniards are in danger of suffering their first defeat in 16 home ties while the Germans are bidding for an upset win and a first appearance in the semi-finals since 2007.         
	A German victory would set up a September semi-final away to surprise package Israel, conquerors of Russia, and a Spanish win would give them home advantage again.         
	Earlier on Sunday in the Argentina verses Czech Republic tie, Juan Martin del Potro levelled the tie when he beat Tomas Berdych 6-4 6-4 6-4.         
	I did everything. I did very good serves and returns and I was feeling very well, Del Porto said.         
	I really expected a very difficult match, Berdych said.         
	I wanted to try something and break his rhythm but I did not make it. He played an outstanding game, he added.         
	With so much at stake on the final match, Czech captain Jaroslav Navratil opted to replace Ivo Minar in the final match with Radek Stepanek even though the world No. 21 has been struggling with a knee problem. Stepanek had missed Fridays singles rubber due to the injury.

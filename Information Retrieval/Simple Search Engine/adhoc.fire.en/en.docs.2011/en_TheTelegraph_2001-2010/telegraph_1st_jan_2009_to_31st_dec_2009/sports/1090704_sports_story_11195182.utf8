	Mumbai: The elections to the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) got spiced up a bit more Friday with Vilasrao Deshmukh, former chief minister and current union minister for heavy industries, filing his nomination for one of the two vice-presidential posts.         
	Yes, he (Deshmukh) is contesting from Pawars group, confirmed joint honorary secretary Hemant Waingankar.         
	Former India captain and chairman of selectors Dilip Vengsarkar would be contesting for the other vice-presidential post. Praveen Barve is the third candidate.         
	There is a three-horse race for the two posts of joint secretary with incumbents Waingankar and P.V. Shetty being joined by former India player Lalchand Rajput.

	The elections are scheduled for July 10 with the nominations closing three days before.

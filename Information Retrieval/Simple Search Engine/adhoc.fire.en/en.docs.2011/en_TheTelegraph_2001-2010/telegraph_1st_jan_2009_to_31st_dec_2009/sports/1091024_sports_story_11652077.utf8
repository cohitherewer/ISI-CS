The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Record price for Sachin camp
                                                   Record price for Sachin camp
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar and landmarks are just made for each other. Off the field too, it seems.         
	The exclusive day long cricket coaching camp with the Little Master, offered on auction as part of the Joy of Giving Week, has fetched Rs 12 lakh  till date, the most expensive transaction on eBay India. The proceeds go to Apnalaya, an NGO working for underprivileged children in Mumbai.         
	Sachin had appealed, in the pages of The Telegraph, to people across borders to be generous with their donations and the response has been handsome.         
	The auction attracted 99 bidders, a number that Sachin has worn on his shirt for India, apart from 1,024 visitors, and triggered off a bidding war before close when it was found that there was a tie between a Whirlpool employee and two philanthropists who had both bid Rs 6 lakh for the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.         
	On one side was the intention to give some star employers an astounding reward and, on the other, a desire to give underprivileged children a unique gift. Thankfully, the final contenders agreed to pool in their bids, with Sachin, too, agreeing to coach both sets of winners.         
	The camp will last for three hours, followed by lunch with Sachin. It will include guidance on batting technique, inputs on fitness, practice routines, coaching for match readiness and psychological training.

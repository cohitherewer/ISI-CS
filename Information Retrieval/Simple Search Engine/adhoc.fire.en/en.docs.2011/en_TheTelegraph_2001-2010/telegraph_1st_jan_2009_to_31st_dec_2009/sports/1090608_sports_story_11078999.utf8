The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Martina inspired me: Paes
                                                   Martina inspired me: Paes
                      
	Paris: Leander Paes, who battled a freak injury and nerves in the French Open mens doubles final, said that an inspiring eye contact with his legendary former mixed doubles partner Martina Navratilova lifted his spirits.         
	Paes and Czech Lukas Dlouhy rallied from a set down to clinch the French Open title, which was the Indians ninth career Grand Slam.         
	Paes got hit between his eyes by a return volley during the match and required treatment. The 35-year-old said Navratilovas presence in the audience gallery helped him get over the testing moments of the match. Whenever I look at a person like Navratilova, she gives me a lot of inspiration. It was strange that just at the end of the second set when we were getting a bit nervous and a bit edgy, she came out there and we just eye contact. Lukas served three doubles faults early in the third set. I told him at one point that Martina is out there. Come on. Have a look at her. Shes inspiring us.         
	Paes described Navratilova, a 20-time Wimbledon champion with whom he won the 2003 Wimbledon and Australian Open mixed doubles titles, as his soulmate and said the American has been by his side through some of the most trying times of his life.         
	Martina has been a soulmate for many years. Weve been through a lot in life, especially me in the last eight years. Shes been along with me, supporting me, guiding me at times, Paes said.

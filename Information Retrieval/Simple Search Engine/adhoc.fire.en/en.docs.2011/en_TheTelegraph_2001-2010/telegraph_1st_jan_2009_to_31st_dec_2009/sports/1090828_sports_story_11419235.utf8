The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ACA sacks tainted secretary
                                                     CRICKET BRIEFS    ACA sacks tainted secretary
                      
	 Hyderabad: The Andhra Cricket Association (ACA) on Thursday formally sacked its secretary V. Chamundeshwarnath, who had earlier been relieved from the post following allegations of corruption and misbehaviour with women players.         
	The association was not satisfied with the explanation offered by him and asked him to appear in person but he did not do so, ACA president G. Gangaraju said.               
	 New Delhi: After leading a virtual revolt against the DDCA, Virender Sehwag on Thursday made it clear that he decided to stay with Delhi after being given a categorical assurance that selection malpractice would be brought to an end. I am happy to note that Jaitley has stressed on the need to have selectors with ethics, integrity and spine, Sehwag said.               
	 New Delhi: Former India captain and ex-chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar has termed the New Zealand Crickets decision to have captain and coachs say in selection matters as unnecessary even as ex-Australia coach John Buchanan backed the move. I feel it is absolutely unnecessary. I feel the captain and coach should be consulted but thats about it, Vengsarkar said. Buchanan, however, said: It would help build the future of New Zealand cricket by giving additional power to the coach. It is definitely a good move.               
	 Melbourne: Ricky Ponting will not mind even if he is stripped of captaincy in the wake of Ashes debacle but his deputy Michael Clarke is not keen to replace his fantastic leader. At the end of the day, hes our leader and has been for my whole career. Im more than happy to keep playing under him, Clarke said.               
	 Amstelveen: Afghanistan celebrated their maiden first-class victory with a one-wicket win over the Netherlands. In the four-day match, part of the Intercontinental Cup tournament, opener Noor Ali top-scored for Afghanistan in their second innings making 56.           AGENCIES

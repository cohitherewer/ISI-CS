	Chittagong: Half centuries from Tillekeratne Dilshan, Thilan Samaraweera and Kumar Sangakkara helped Sri Lanka reach 296 for four in their second innings at the close of the third day of the second Test against Bangladesh on Monday.         
	The visitors, 1-0 up in the two-Test series, extended their overall lead to 472 without losing a wicket in the final session.         
	Bangladesh had their only chance to get a wicket in the last session when Dilshan on 51 edged Mashrafe Mortaza to Zunaed Siddique who dropped the chance at slip. Zunaed also dropped Dilshan in the first innings on 78.         
	Their unbroken 131-run stand for the fifth wicket helped Sri Lanka add 109 runs in the final session on an increasingly lifeless pitch.         
	The partnership came after Sangakkara had scored 54 before dragging a delivery from rival skipper Mohammed Ashraful on to the stumps.         
	Earlier Jayawardene, playing in his 100th Test, was out for 22, caught at short-cover by Imrul Kayes off left-arm spinner Enamul Haque. Jayawardene made 11 in the first innings.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | East Bengal look to Bhutia for a boost
                                                     East Bengal look to Bhutia for a boost
            K KUMARASWAMY            Bhaichung Bhutia                           
	Pune: Bhaichung Bhutias return to East Bengal ranks may have given their morale the much needed boost, still the red and gold brigade will start with a handicap, literally and figuratively, when they take on newcomers Pune FC in their opening round match of the I League, here on Saturday.         
	Off-the-field issues concerning the coach, no foreigners in the line-up and four consecutive losses in probably the dullest start to a season  East Bengal couldnt have asked for more impediments.         
	That is, of course, without taking into account the lack of match practice to Bhaichung, who is also carrying a slight hamstring injury and the challenging conditions of a ground that is hosting its first I-League tie.         
	Coach Subhas Bhowmick, under fire following the teams disastrous showing in the IFA Shield and Durand Cup, sought to play down the problems confronting his team.         
	Any first round match is a difficult one. One can never say until the ball rolls, Bhowmick said on the eve of the match at the Shiv Chatrapathi Sports Complex.         
	Bhaichung (who has not played since the final of the Nehru Cup in August) will lack rhythm a bit but, given the situation, you cant help it, he added, confirming the Indian captains start on Saturday.         
	The team management had sacked the three foreigners  Edmilson Marques, Jan Berger and Sebastian Omer  last month and has not been able to find a replacement for any one of them. The lone overseas player the team unveiled a few days back, Julius Irabor Apkele, turned out to have an anterior cruciate ligament injury during medical tests.         
	East Bengals predicament is in stark contrast to the vibrancy of Pune FC, which is the first team to have filled their quota of five foreigners.         
	Apart from Arata Izumi, a Japanese midfield player of Indian origin, Nigerian Chika Wali who has been the backbone of the defence in the last couple of seasons, Uzbek midfielder Sergey Tokov, Brazilian forward Edmar Figueira and Ivory Coast playmaker Djidjia Dohou Pierre, the hosts biggest asset would be goalkeeper Subrata Paul.         
	Bhowmick was concerned by the ground conditions and

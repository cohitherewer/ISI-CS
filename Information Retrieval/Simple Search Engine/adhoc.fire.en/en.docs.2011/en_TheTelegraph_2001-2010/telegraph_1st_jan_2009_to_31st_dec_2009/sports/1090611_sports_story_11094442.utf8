The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ireland dance to Zaheers tune
                                                   Ireland dance to Zaheers tune
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	India produced a clinical performance to beat Ireland by eight wickets in their final group league match at Trent Bridge on Wednesday.         
	Man of the Match Zaheer Khan set the ball rolling, and the batsmen, too, didnt disappoint. Gautam Gambhir and Rohit Sharma put on 77 in an opening partnership as India reached the target in 15.3 overs.         
	Against a listless Irish attack, India hardly broke a sweat with Gambhir and Rohit going great guns.         
	Rohit remained unbeaten on 52 (4x4, 1x6) off 45 balls. Gambhir made 37 (3x4, 1x6) off 31 balls and Mahendra Singh Dhoni contributed 14.         
	Zaheer produced a superb spell of pace and swing bowling to restrict Ireland to 112 for eight in 18 overs.         
	The pacer took three wickets in his first spell and added another later to finish with four for 19 from three overs. The match was reduced to 18 overs after persistent drizzle delayed the start. Dhoni put Ireland in to bat on winning the toss.         
	After Zaheer had removed the top-order, Pragyan Ojha and Harbhajan Singh got into the act. While the batsmen struggled against the pace and swing of Zaheer, the spinners were bang on target from the outset. Offering very little width and varying the pace intelligently, they had the batsmen in a quandary.         
	Zaheer took wickets in consecutive overs as Ireland struggled to come to terms with the conditions. Zaheer, who made a comeback from a shoulder injury only in the last game, was fast and accurate Wednesday.         
	After rattling Jeremy Brays stumps with a full-length delivery, Zaheer had William Porterfield caught at first slip as the batsman went for an expansive square drive. The Ireland captain was dismissed off the first ball of Zaheers second over and Andre Botha followed five balls later.         
	The dismissal was almost identical as Botha chased another full-length delivery without moving his feet and Yusuf Pathan was at hand to take a sharp chance at slip. If Zaheer proved to be a handful, the Irish had to negotiate the swing of Irfan Pathan and the sharp seam movement of Ishant Sharma too.         
	Ojha bowled Kevin Brien off an inside edge with his first delivery. It was Harbhajans turn to show his wizardry then. Gary Wilson played the wrong line and was done in by the doosra.         
	John Mooney (19) got the start but perished trying to reverse sweep Ojha and in the next delivery, Regan West (1) ran himself out.         
	The Ireland innings never got the momentum needed because of the regular fall of wickets. None of the batsmen got the time to settle down as they were done in by some disciplined and controlled bowling.         
	It was only in the later stages that Alex Cusack and Kyle McCallan used the long handle to good effect. Twenty four runs came off the last two overs as Ireland crossed the 100-run mark.         
	Andrew White was the top scorer for Ireland scoring 29 off 25 balls, including three boundaries.         
	Amid a superb bowling and batting performance, the Indian ground fielding, however, was patchy at times. Persistent drizzle earlier delayed the start. The steady drizzle prompted the groundsmen to put the square under cover.         
	With both the sides having already made it to the Super Eight stage, nothing really was at stake but Dhoni meant serious business when he walked out with a full-strength team, determined to get another win under the belt. It was the same squad that beat Bangladesh in their first match.         
	Ireland, who will play New Zealand in their Super Eight match Thursday, chose not to risk Trent Johnston, who took three wickets against Bangladesh, and the injured Niall Brien. Andrew White and Andre Botha took their places.

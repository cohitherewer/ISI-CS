            Henry Winter            Manchester Uniteds John Shea celebrates his goal against Arsenal at Old Trafford on Wednesday. (AP)                           
	Manchester: Never the most modest breed, Manchester United fans have taken to wearing centurion helmets and they certainly marched closer to the Rome final of the Champions League on Wednesday night.         
	Utterly irresistible in the first half when they hit Arsenal with a perfect storm, the European champions would have one foot in the Eternal City already but for the shot-stopping feats of Manuel Almunia.         
	Thanks to the Spaniard who withstood the inquisition, this full-on, full-English semi-final remains alive. Just. Arsenal cannot afford one mistake at the Emirates on Tuesday, one defensive slip by Mikael Silvestre as on Wednesday, one lapse in concentration by Emmanuel Adebayor at a United corner as on Wendnesday. If United score, requiring Arsenal to beat Edwin van der Sar three times, the Londoners season is over.         
	John Shea struck their goal on Wednesday but Cristiano Ronaldo almost broke the bar from 30 yards, Rooney deserved more tangible return for his creativity and persistence while Carlos Tevez was twice athletically denied by Almunia. We know we can go there and score  thats the problem Arsenal have to carry, reflected Ferguson. This team can make chances again.         
	Particularly if an Old Trafford old boy messes up. On climbing off the Arsenal bus, Silvestre had been warmly greeted by club staff in the tunnel. Handshakes and hearty words all round. Uniteds pleasure in seeing one of their alumni intensified after 17 minutes when Silvestre erred badly. When Anderson whipped over a corner from the right, the danger appeared to subside as the ball cleared the centre. Adebayor wandered upfield, leaving the far post area unprotected. Carrick reached the ball ahead of Abou Diaby, rounding Bacary Sagna and crossing low and hard.         
	Arsenal panicked. Silvestre poked out a leg but succeeded only in diverting the ball to Shea, left unmarked by Adebayor. Arsenals fortress was vulnerable, the ramparts breached. Shea caught the ball first time, his unstoppable drive making the net tug on its stanchions like rigging in a gale.         
	Sheas goal was the very least the champions deserved. Uniteds mood and tempo had been terrific from the off. Fergusons 4-3-3 tactics were designed to squeeze the space around Arsenal and give United numbers going forward on all fronts. An all-action three-man midfield of Darren Fletcher, Carrick and the excellent Anderson hounded Fabregas, who was trying to pull the strings for Arsenal behind an unresponsive Adebayor.         
	Fergusons three-man attack stretched Arsenal constantly. Bursts of Portuguese lightning in the form of Ronaldo gave Kieran Gibbs, a promising but inexperienced left-back, real nightmares. To the delight of the fans, Carlos Tevez had started, his hair soon glistening with sweat as he ran and ran, chased and chased.         
	Over on the left, Rooney was again in his element, creating chances for colleagues, cutting inside, shooting from range, including an outrageous 50-yard half-volley that faded wide. Rooney was everywhere. When Fabregas paused on the ball in Uniteds half, Arsenals captain was rudely interrupted by a thunderous tackle. Old Trafford loved it. Arsenal hated it.         
	Even before Shea forced the breakthrough, United had come hammering at Arsenals back door so hard it almost flew off its hinges. One move was utterly breathtaking. Ronaldo swept the ball into Tevez, who managed to flick it right despite being clattered by Silvestre. Shea ran on, eluding Gibbs and delivering in a cross that Tevez crashed goalwards. Almunia saved. Somehow.         
	Almunia then saved a header and shot from Ronaldo. This wasnt a siege, this was an invasion. Arsenals keeper stood firm, repelling the raiders in red, even risking injury to frustrate United. When Tevez dived in with studs glinting under the floodlights, Almunia came flying out, knowing that pain hurtled his way. Tevez was slightly reckless and Almunia took the full force of a stocky Argentine in the face.         
	At times, Tevez really looks worth the additional 22 million required to make his loan deal permanent. If Arsenal could call on such a force as Tevez they would look forward to Tuesday with more belief. But its not over yet. If Arsenal dig deep, they have a chance. A slim one.

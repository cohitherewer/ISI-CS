                                                   Id like to see Harbhajan bowl better, says Dhoni
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nagpur: Mahendra Singh Dhoni Tuesday said India needed to work on their bowling at the death for better results.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Injuries in the Australian camp         
	We came for practice with work needed in a few areas. We concentrated on that. We needed to work on our death bowling and also with the new ball. We are concentrating on areas that can affect us in a direct way. Not really thinking about their injuries... They have a squad of 15. Lets see...         
	Bowling at the death         
	Its been a worrying thing for us over the past few months. We have not been great with our death bowling. If you see the last game, the first few overs  42nd over onwards  were good and, in the 50th, we gave away one run. In between, there was a span of four overs when we gave away 50-52 runs. If we can bring that down, say by two to five runs, it will be good It can count in the end.         
	Update on the Indian camp         
	Everybody is fit to play.         
	The wicket         
	Looks like a good wicket There is a little bit of grass cover which will help in binding the wicket. I dont see too much of a change in the condition of the wicket. Dew will be a factor but how much we will see and decide accordingly.         
	Whether he should bat up the order         
	Its a difficult choice to make. The top-order is almost fixed Viru (Virender Sehwag) and Sachin (Tendulkar) open the innings, Gautam (Gambhir) at No.3, Yuvraj (Singh) at No.4. The next slot available is No.5. It depends on the strength of the individuals available. Accordingly we select individuals to bat at particular slots. I float at times and have batted at different positions. But to say I have to bat every time at No.3 or No. 4 ... that is difficult for me (to do)         
	Yuvrajs availability         
	Yuvi has been the backbone of our batting at No.4. Its an important slot, as important as No.3 Especially with the second Powerplay coming in you have some time to settle down If you have an individual like Yuvraj who can capitalise on that, its of great help. His bowling, too, helps as you have one more part-timer who has been bowling well. With injuries, the luxury of having three to four part- timers is not there anymore. With Yuvraj, theres the luxury of three. If one part-timer has an off day, you have the others to fall back on.         
	Amit Mishras chances         
	Right now, it is difficult to fit in Mishra.         
	Harbhajan Singhs bowling         
	He is an experienced bowler. Hes not bowling at his best but still bowling well. Everyone goes through such a patch. He loves challenges and can always bounce back. We have confidence in him. Hes spending ample time at the nets and working hard. Hes batting well but we would like to see him bowling better         
	Praveen Kumars performance         
	He bowled well with the new ball in Vadodara. It was just that some of the edges didnt carry to the slip fielder. If you look at the replays youll see he bowled much better than what the scorecard shows.         
	Choosing the batting Powerplay         
	Getting to know the best time to take it (Powerplay) is important. It depends on the conditions You may want to take it from the 34th over onwards You know the ball will be hard, it will not reverse that much If you have set batsmen and the luxury of seven or eight wickets in hand you will go for it then Even if you lose a couple of wickets you can accelerate and then carry on that momentum into the slog overs. Thats one of the many ways of using the Powerplay. Of course, some teams have used it from the 44th or 45th over. Everyone has preferences...         
	Indias success rate         
	Our match winning percentage was close to 70 per cent. We are winning about 50 per cent now... This team is going through a changing period and has been missing quite a few players because of injuries. The youngsters are coming in and learning the art of bowling and batting in ODIs. We are going through a tough period when everyone is finding it tough to performIm sure that at the end of the year after 25-30 ODIs these youngsters would have learnt enough and will perform.

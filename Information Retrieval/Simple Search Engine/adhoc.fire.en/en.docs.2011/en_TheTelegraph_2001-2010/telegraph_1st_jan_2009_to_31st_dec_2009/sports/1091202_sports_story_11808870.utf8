The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wada set to launch new system 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Wada set to launch new system 
                      
	London: After years of discussion and development, the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) is ready to launch a global programme to monitor athletes blood profiles for evidence of cheating.         
	Meeting in Stockholm this week to mark the 10th-year anniversary of its creation, Wada is expected to ratify the athlete biological passport system that has been under consideration since 2002.         
	The project involves collecting and storing athletes blood samples and monitoring them over time for any variations that could indicate doping  without an actual positive test.         
	International cycling federation UCI has implemented its own blood profiling system, but Wada has finalised protocols for a programme it hopes can be adopted by federations and countries around the world. The passport system will be up for approval Wednesday by Wadas foundation board.         
	The idea is to provide the anti-doping world in general with a model so that any organisation, whether it be at the national or international level, can use this, Wada director general David Howman said on Monday.         
	The blood profiles would be registered in Wadas database and could be used for target-testing or sanctioning athletes when abnormal values are recorded.         
	This would add a major weapon in the anti-doping fight, which has traditionally relied on analysis of standard drug tests. (AP)

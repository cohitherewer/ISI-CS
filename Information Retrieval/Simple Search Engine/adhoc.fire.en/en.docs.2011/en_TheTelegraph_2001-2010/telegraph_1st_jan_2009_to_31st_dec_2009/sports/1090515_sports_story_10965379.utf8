                                                   Warne: Botha a boost for us
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Rajasthan Royals captain-cum-coach Shane Warne said Bothas inclusion would be a great boost to the side after the spinner was signed by the franchise.         
	Johan Botha is a sensational player and we were disappointed when he couldnt be part of our squad at the start of the tournament. It is a real boost, Warne said.

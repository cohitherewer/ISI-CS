                                                   Lanka bank on spinners
                      
	Nottingham: Sri Lanka expect the spinners to pick up another rich haul when they take on the West Indies in the World Twenty20 semi-final at the Oval on Friday.         
	The Sri Lankans have bulldozed their way through the tournament with five straight wins, mainly on the back of spin twins Ajantha Mendis and Muttiah Muralidharan who lead a balanced bowling attack.         
	Mendis has so far picked up 11 wickets in the tournament, just one behind Pakistan seamer Umar Guls tally of 12.         
	Murali has five wickets, while fast bowler Lasith Malinga has picked up 10 with a mix of toe-crushing yorkers and slower deliveries.         
	Former captain Mahela Jayawardene said he was confident the bowlers would deliver at the crunch time. Look Murali can turn the ball on any surface, Jayawardene said of the star off-spinner, who is the worlds highest wicket-taker in both Tests and one-day cricket.         
	And if Ajantha sticks to his plans, we have a fairly good chance of going all the way.         
	Mendis grabbed three for 9 in three overs as Sri Lanka routed New Zealand by 48 runs in their last Super Eight match at Trent Bridge Tuesday.         
	The Black Caps failed to chase down 159 in a must-win game and were shot out for 110 in 17 overs.         
	Jayawardene said the team was taking it one match at a time and would not be carried away just because they had reached the semi-finals. We set goals for ourselves when we came to the tournament. At the start was going through the first round, then the Super Eights.         
	Now we have two goals left, win the semis and the final. We have to stay calm and focused on the job at hand.         
	Jaywardene said the secret of Sri Lankas success in the tournament was trying to stay one step ahead of the others, like bringing on the slow bowlers in the first six overs when the field was inside the circle.         
	As a team we realise we have to peak at a certain time in the tournament, he said. (AP)

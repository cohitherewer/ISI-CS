                                                   IOA panel faces lawsuit over shirt deal
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The sponsor of the Indian hockey team, Sahara India, has threatened to take the ad hoc committee of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) to court for not using the companys logo on the T-shirts of the national teams players during the ongoing Punjab Gold Cup international tournament in Chandigarh.         
	While the ad hoc committee said that the logo was dropped after Sahara failed to make any payment for the past nine months, the companys marketing agents said they were always ready to pay the money.         
	S.S. Dasgupta, the chairman and managing director of the Calcutta-based Leisure Sports Management (LSM), the marketing agents of Sahara , said: We cannot pay the money to anyone without proper papers. The ad hoc committee raised objections on a couple of clauses on the sponsorship deal and we ratified them accordingly.         
	Since then, they have not contacted us. How can we pay them the money? We have served the IOA a legal notice, Dasgupta said.         
	The convener of the ad hoc committee, Mohammed Aslam, said the logo had to be removed from the team T-shirts after Sahara failed to make payment for nine months.         
	The logo was used in the Azlan Shah tournament, the junior Asia Cup, the junior teams four-nation event in Australia and during the senior national teams tour of Argentina.         
	On behalf of Sahara , LSM had entered into an eight-year contract worth approximately Rs 20 crore with the erstwhile Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) in 2004 to have the company logo on the senior as well as junior national team jerseys during all international tournaments. The contract existed even after the dissolution of the K.P.S. Gill-led IHF.

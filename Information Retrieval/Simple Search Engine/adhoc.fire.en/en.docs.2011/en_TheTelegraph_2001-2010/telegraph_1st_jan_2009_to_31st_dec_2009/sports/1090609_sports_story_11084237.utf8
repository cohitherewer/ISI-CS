The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Smith pleased with victory
                                                   Smith pleased with victory
                      
	London: South Africa captain Graeme Smith said his side had sent a message after their crushing 130-run win over Scotland at the ICC World Twenty20.         
	Victory in their first match of the tournament saw the Proteas advance to Super Eight and provided a textbook display of how a Test side ought to deal with one of the minnow nations at this event.         
	The tournament began in dramatic style on Friday with hosts England losing off the last ball to The Netherlands at Lords while Saturday saw Scotland give New Zealand a scare in a match reduced by rain to seven overs per side. But led by AB de Villierss blistering 79 not out, featuring six sixes, South Africa piled up a huge total of 211 for five here at the Oval.         
	Fast bowler Dale Steyn then struck early on and when Scotland were bowled out for 81, they had suffered the second heaviest defeat suffered by any side in a Twenty20 international  Sri Lanka beat Kenya by 172 runs during the inaugural World Twenty20 in Johannesburg two years ago.         
	We probably had a few more nerves after watching the first few days of the tournament and seeing a few of the unpredictable results, said Smith, who shared a first-wicket stand of 87 with Jacques Kallis. It was important to send a message and we did that.         
	Scotland captain Gavin Hamilton admitted his largely part-time team had been given some lessons, especially by the Proteas batsmen.         
	They are an absolutely fantastic outfit, ex-England batsman Hamilton said. They didnt give us any breathing space at all. (AFP)

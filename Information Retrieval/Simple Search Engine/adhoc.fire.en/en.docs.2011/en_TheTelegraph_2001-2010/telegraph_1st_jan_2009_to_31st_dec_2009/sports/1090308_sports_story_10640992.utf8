                                                   Weve got to win: Taylor
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Christchurch: New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor admits his side have lost the momentum in the one-dayers after a dream start in the two T20 matches. Speaking on the eve of the third ODI, Taylor said despite the setback he was confident that the Black Caps would bounce back.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On New Zealands performance         
	Probably a little bit disappointed with the way we bowled. We knew our plans and what we wanted to do; just didnt execute it as well.         
	On the pressure to perform         
	After the rained-out game weve got to win, Dans (Daniel Vettori) told us its a must-win game.         
	Their strategy for the Indian batsmen         
	Apart from giving away too many secrets,we have to bowl a tight line. They like width. And yeah, we have to pitch it up a little bit more. If we bowl a heavy ball and force them to hit down the ground more, itll give us a chance and help us set fields as well.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rookie not surprised
                                                   Rookie not surprised
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                                  Kulkarni		    
	Mumbai: Dhawal Kulkarni says he is not surprised by the India call-up as he was the leading wicket-taker in Ranji Trophy and the second highest in first-class cricket this season.         
	It did not come as a big surprise. I was expecting to be called up even for Sri Lanka (for the ODI series). But the call has come now and Im happy, Kulkarni told The Telegraph.         
	Kulkarni was the bowling spearhead of Mumbai, who won a record 38th Ranji Trophy title this year. The wiry lad picked up 42 wickets  the best tally alongside Saurashtras Ravindra Jadeja  in nine matches at a measly 19.35.         
	His haul of 49 wickets in domestic cricket is second only to 52 scalps by Mohnish Parmar, the Gujarat offie, who has been asked by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to undergo remedial measures for suspect action at the National Cricket Academy (NCA).         
	Kulkarni has often displayed a knack for picking up a wicket at the start of a spell. And a 5/76 in the second innings of the Ranji Trophy final came as a proof of his big-match temperament.         
	But Kulkarni had already made those concerned sit and take note with his impressive performance in the inaugural Indian Premier League  in which he played for Mumbai Indians  last year.         
	The IPL was the turning point for me. I rubbed shoulders with stars like Sachin Tendulkar and Shaun Pollock and interacted with Glenn McGrath (who played for Delhi DareDevils), said the 20-year-old, who had started off as a batsman.         
	A scholarship to Australias Centre of Excellence in Brisbane came as a big boost. Training under Troy Cooley, the former Australian bowler who was instrumental in Englands 2005 Ashes victory, was a huge learning experience for him.         
	I picked up vital lessons there, more about fitness than fast bowling, Kulkarni said.         
	Lalchand Rajput, the former India coach who was with Mumbai Indians last year, rated Kulkarni highly. He is sharp and has increased his pace since last season. His strength is the bouncer which he can follow up with a good yorker, Rajput said.         
	The biggest plus for Kulkarni in New Zealand would be his experience of playing there for the India under-19 team. On that 2007 tour  consisting of three Tests and as many ODIs  he played one Test and had decent figures of 3/33 and 2/42.         
	Rajput said that all his former ward had to do was to keep his composure.         
	He should not be overawed by the conditions. He has to focus on bowling in the right areas, the former India player said.         
	Last time he tried to bowl short and got hit. Then he adjusted his length and got wickets. This time, too, he should remember that three-quarters of the pitch is the right length because there (in New Zealand) the ball will swing a lot.  
	Kulkarni FACT-FILE    Name: Dhawal Kulkarni  Born: December 10, 1988  Major teams: India, India A, India under-19, Mumbai Indians  Bowling style: Right-arm medium  Batting style: Right-handed  Performance in first-class cricket: 49 wickets in 13 matches (42 from 9 matches in Ranji Trophy, 4 from 2 matches in Duleep Trophy and 3 from 2 matches against Australia A).   Kulkarni has four 5-wicket hauls in Ranji Trophy with 7/50 being his best.  Note: 2008-09 was his first   first-class season

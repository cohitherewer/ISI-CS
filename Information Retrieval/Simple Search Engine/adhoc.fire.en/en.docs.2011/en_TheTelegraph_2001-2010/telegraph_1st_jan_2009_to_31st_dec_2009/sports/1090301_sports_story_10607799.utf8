    - Mohammedan Sporting fritter away 2-0 advantage           A STAFF REPORTER            Striker Sunil Chetri (picture above) celebrates after scoring the equaliser for East Bengal as teammates join in. Earlier, Eugene Gray and Mike Okoro with Suroj Mondal (picture below) had been over the moon after Mohammedan Sportings second goal at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.

	Calcutta: It was a tale of two halves at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. If the first half was about Mohammedan Sporting surprising one and all by taking a 2-0 lead, the change of ends saw East Bengal pulling up their socks and coming back strongly to finish the match on even terms.         
	But for a little luck  Sunil Chetris acrobatic header hitting the horizontal and, then at the fag end, his lunging touch missing the target by a whisker  East Bengal could have left the pitch with full points. But that would have been too harsh on a team who, battling hard to beat the drop this season, deserved at least a point from this scuffle.         
	Mohammedan Sporting skipper Mike Okoro put his team ahead in the fourth minute and then Eugene Gray made it all the more difficult for the red and gold brigade by making it 2-0.         
	Staring at defeat in the very next match after the sensational win over Mohun Bagan, East Bengal woke from their slumber after the change of ends. Nirmal Chetri pulled one back three minutes into the second half and the equaliser came in the 54th minute through an industrious Sunil.         
	On the eve of this 17th round I-League match Subhas had been wary of complacency, and his worst fears came true as the red and gold brigade took things a bit too easy.         
	Syed Rahim Nabi, last Sundays hero, missed a sitter inside the six-yard box even before the match commissioner could take his seat and, minutes after the first goal, Sunil volleyed over when he had only the goalkeeper, Naseem Akhtar to beat.         
	The midfield quartet of Nabi, Mehtab Hossain, Ismael Addo and Rennedy Singh were looking seemingly at sea; right back Saumik Dey was finding the going tough against the likes of Suroj Mondal and Gautam Thakur and the two central defenders  M. Suresh and Nirmal Chetri were caught napping time and again.         
	Take the first goal for instance. Rajib Ghoshs lob from the deep and East Bengals defence went for a disastrous offside trap. Okoro, a master in beating these traps, timed his run to perfection and lobbed it past an onrushing Abhra Mondal.         
	Even for the second goal, the defences performance left a lot to be desired. Suraj Mondal left Soumik Dey way behind him and passed to Satyajit Bose inside the box. Bose played it for Eugene Gray who made no mistake in slotting home.         
	Ten minutes before the lemon break Subhas brought in Jayanta Sen in place of Dey and moved Rahim Nabi into the left back slot. That change had its effect straightaway as East Bengal started showing more urgency.         
	In any case, the inexperienced Mohammedan Sporting defence was not expected to hold back the likes of Yusif Yakubu and Sunil. And as the pressure mounted from both the flanks the back four caved in.         
	Yakubu, in particular, was at his menacing best, drawing out his marker and creating that extra space for Sunil and Surkumar.         
	Rennedys deliveries too were getting the desired accuracy and East Bengal pulled one back in the 48th minute. Nirmal Chetri out-jumped his marker and headed in Rennedys corner. In the 54th it was 2-2. Yakubu did well to keep Surkumars deep centre in, and Sunil Chetris acrobatic jab went past a bewildered Naseem Akhar.

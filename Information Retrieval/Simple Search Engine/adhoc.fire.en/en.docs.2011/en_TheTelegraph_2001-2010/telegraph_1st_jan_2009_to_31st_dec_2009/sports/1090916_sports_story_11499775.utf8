            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bhowmick                           
	New Delhi: Despite feeling hot under the collar in the IFA Shield, Subhas Bhowmick remains unmoved.         
	The East Bengal coach has lost none of his appetite for experiments and doing things just the way he wants.         
	As East Bengal prepare to take on Shillongs Lajong FC on Wednesday in the Durand Cup quarter final league, Bhowmick is set to throw open a new formation.         
	A formation that will have Czech recruit Ian Berger in the sweeper role, while Mehrajuddin Wadoo is expected to don the role of a marker in defence.         
	Bhowmicks shift is not limited to defence alone. In midfield, Harmanjit Singh Khabra and Rennedy Singh may take positions on the right and left, respectively.         
	Riston Rodrigues will play in central midfield along with Alvito DCunha, whose role will be different, said Bhowmick.         
	Indications are that a fit Alvito  following recommendation from Bhaichung Bhutia  will play just behind the two forwards  Sebastian Omar and Subhas Singh.         
	Under Bhowmick, East Bengal had won the Durand Cup twice before in 2002 and 2004 but this time the coach is under tremendous pressure. Two big defeats against Tata Football Academy and Chirag United in the IFA Shield have raised serious doubts about the coachs ability to carry the team throughout the season.         
	 Meanwhile, Churchill Brothers defeated Sporting Clube de Goa 1-0 in Group I league match. Okolie Odafe scored the match winner in the 82 nd minute.

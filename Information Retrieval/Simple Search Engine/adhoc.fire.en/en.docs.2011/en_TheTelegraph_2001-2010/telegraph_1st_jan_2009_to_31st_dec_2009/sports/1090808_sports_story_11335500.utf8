	Colombo: Pakistan ended their losing run against Sri Lanka with a comprehensive 146-run victory in the fourth one-day International on Friday.         
	The tourists, who lost the Test series 0-2 and trailed the one-day series 0-3, won their first game of a difficult tour after teenager Umar Akmal scored a brilliant maiden century, powering Pakistan to a formidable 321 for five.         
	Akmal, the 19-year-old brother of wicketkeeper Kamran, smashed an unbeaten 102 off just 72 balls with five fours and four sixes.         
	Sri Lanka made a confident start with opener Upul Tharanga stroking 80 off 89 deliveries and skipper Kumar Sangakkara cracking 39 from 33 balls, but then struggled when the ball grew softer on a slow spinning pitch.         
	The hosts eventually collapsed in the middle overs with medium pacer Rao Iftikhar Anjum claiming five for 30.         
	Off spinner Saeed Ajmal claimed two for 24 from seven overs and leg spinner Shahid Afridi took two for 40.         
	Sri Lanka were bowled out for 175 in 36.1 overs.         
	Earlier, Pakistan made the most out of a good batting pitch having won the toss with Kamran Akmal (57) and Imran Nazir (23) adding 61 for the first wicket.         
	The pace was set early by Umars elder brother Kamran, who ensured the tempo did not flag despite Nazirs early dismissal. Sri Lankas slow bowlers fought back, reducing Pakistan from 106 for one to 130 for four, but Umar Akmal then took centre stage with a magnificent display of hitting.         
	Where Nazir, Mohammed Yousuf and Misbah-ul Haq struggled against a combination of tidy bowling and a slow track, Umar appeared comfortable from the onset.         
	He showed he wasnt going to get bogged down, swinging his seventh delivery off Ajantha Mendis over long-on for a six.         
	His was a sensible approach, poaching the odd boundary and turning ones into twos while also dominating the perceived weaker bowlers.         
	He was efficient in finding the narrowest of gaps in the field.         
	Captain Younus Khan provided support with a 89 from 111 balls, a more measured innings that included just four boundaries.         
	Younis innings contained crisp drives and wristy flicks but most importantly it was an effort that allowed Umar to flourish.         
	Around his captain, Umar could play his own game and Pakistan didnt feel the pinch. Pakistan had been hurt in the series by Youniss indifferent form.         
	The fifth-wicket pair shared a match-winning 176-run partnership, plundering runs at a frenetic rate during the final overs of the innings.         
	Leg spinner Malinga Bandara was Sri Lankas most economical and effective bowler, claiming two for 44 from his 10 overs.         
	Sri Lanka did not help their own cause by giving away 29 wides, 26 of which were delivered by Lasith Malinga.         
	Meanwhile, Sri Lanka pacer Dilhara Fernando will be out for at least two weeks due to an arm injury.         
	Fernando will miss the remainder of the series against Pakistan after sustaining an arm injury.         
	According to Sri Lanka manager Brendon Kuruppu, Fernando injured his right arm while fielding in the third One-day International against Pakistan in Dambulla.         
	Reports added that he had a grade-two tear on his right teres major muscle in the posterior part of his right shoulder. (REUTERS)

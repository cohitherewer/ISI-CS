The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I have made amends, says a proud Biswas 
                                                     I have made amends, says a proud Biswas 
  - Energy-sapping match takes toll on captain Habibur       OUR CORRESPONDENT              Raghu Nandy          Gauranga Biswas                                 
	Chennai: Bengal captain Habibur Rehman Mondal gave media the slip after the semi-final victory over Services in the Santosh Trophy here Wednesday.         
	The reason? He straightway got admitted into Apollo Hospital as the heat in the city was too much for him. Its nothing new for Habibur to go for rehydration after an energy-sapping match. He has a fluid problem that he has been living with since childhood.         
	After an I-league match against Vasco in October last year, Habibur was admitted to a Goa hospital for similar treatment. He will be released by midnight, a Bengal official said late on Wednesday.         
	Meanwhile, Bengals new hero, Gauranga Biswas said Wednesdays match was his best till date.         
	I have scored two goals in the past. But never before in a match of this magnitude.         
	We are in the final and I am the hero. Its yet to sink in, Biswas said wiping off beads of sweat from his forehead.         
	I missed too many chances in the previous matches, but today I think I have made amends. Services are a good side and I am proud that we beat them, Biswas said.         
	Biswas, who played for Chirag United last season, said the first goal was the special one.         
	I deliberately got myself in between the defenders and the goalkeeper. I followed the ball till the last and it was a well-executed goal, he said.         
	Coach Raghu Nandy said the turnaround was the match against Punjab.         
	That match gave us the belief that we can do it. I am happy the team carried out my instructions to the T. To play defensive was because this Services team was too fast.         
	Our ploy did not allow them to play their normal game, he said.

                                                     Australians lord over England 
  - Strauss amp; Co. suffer second defeat in three days       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Brett Lee celebrates the fall of another England wicket during the second ODI at Lords on Sunday. (AP)                                 
	London: England suffered their second defeat in three days to leave them with a mountain to climb in the NatWest Series against Australia.         
	Despite Paul Collingwoods half-century at Lords, England fell short by 39 runs to leave them needing three wins from five remaining matches to take the series.         
	The hosts collapsed to 210 all out after moving to 74 without loss in their run chase, with the regular wickets starting to fall after Shane Watson trapped Ravi Bopara leg before in his first over. Then in his next, he had Matt Prior caught behind for a single.         
	Next to go was captain Andrew Strauss, caught and bowled by Nathan Hauritz three short of his fifty, and Owais Shah was run out when Collingwood called for a single after nudging into the off side.         
	Eoin Morgan and Tim Bresnan, the two changes from Fridays defeat at the Oval, were dismissed by Mitchell Johnson and Luke Wright departed after a brief cameo, leaving England relying on Collingwood to see them home.         
	There was brief hope when Graeme Swann was at the crease but Nathan Bracken accounted for him and Ryan Sidebottom in the same over.         
	England were set 250 to win after an Australian innings that lacked a batsman going on to make a big total, only Callum Ferguson reaching the half-century mark.         
	It meant back-to-back 50s for the South Australia batsman. But the 24-year-old lacked support from his middle order, after openers Watson and Tim Paine got the tourists off to a solid start.         
	They went fairly untroubled until Wright helped make the breakthrough with a stunning catch to dismiss Watson before taking the wicket of Paine, who was caught in the deep.         
	When Wright then had Australia captain Michael Clarke gloving behind down the leg-side, the momentum was with England after a burst of three wickets for 11 runs.         
	Ferguson and Cameron White steadied Australia with a 69-run partnership before the golden arm of Bopara struck. With his first ball, Bopara had White (42) caught behind by Prior  who was standing up to the medium-pacer.         
	England were sharing the wickets around, and next to strike was Swann, with a perfectly-pitched off-break which defeated left-hander Michael Hussey and hit off-stump. James Hopes also went cheaply to Swann, this time sweeping to go lbw.         
	England looked in control when Ferguson was bowled off his pads by James Anderson but Johnson finished the innings off with 43 from 23 balls, including a deft sweep off Anderson and a powerful blow through mid-wicket in the same over.

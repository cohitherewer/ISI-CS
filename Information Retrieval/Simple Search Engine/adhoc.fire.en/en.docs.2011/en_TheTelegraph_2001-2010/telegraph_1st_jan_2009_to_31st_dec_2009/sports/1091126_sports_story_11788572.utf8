	London: Leander Paes and his Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy lost their match to Bryan bothers  Bob and Mike  3-6, 4-6 in the ATP World Tour Finals, here on Wednesday. The match lasted one hour and 24 minutes.         
	Earlier, Robin Soderling advanced to the singles semi-finals by beating Novak Djokovic 7-6 (5), 6-1 for his second straight win at the season-ending tournament.         
	The Swede outlasted Djokovic in a tense first set despite wasting three straight set points with the third-ranked Serb serving at 5-4. Djokovic then put up little resistance in the second and was broken three straight times, netting a forehand on Soderlings second match point.         
	Soderling entered the tournament as an alternate after Andy Roddick pulled out with an injury, but he also beat Rafael Nadal in straight sets on Monday in a rematch of their French Open encounter.         
	He is the first player to reach the semi-finals at the tournament for the top eight players in the world.         
	The loss ended Djokovics 11-match winning streak, and was his first defeat against Soderling in six encounters. Djokovic beat Nikolay Davydenko in his first group match and can still advance to the semi-finals.         
	Soderling started with an ace on the first point and let his strong serve carry him throughout the match. He was never broken and finished with 10 aces.         
	Djokovic had his only two break points when leading 15-40 at 1-1 in the first set, but Soderling bailed himself out with three straight service winners followed by an ace.         
	The Swede then led 0-40 at 5-4 but missed a number of shots to keep Djokovic in the set. In the tiebreaker, Soderling took a 6-4 lead with a forehand volley and then converted his fifth set point with a service winner.         
	He won the last six games of the second as Djokovic grew increasingly frustrated an error-prone. The Serb now likely needs to beat Nadal to reach the semi-finals.         
	I didnt enjoy playing todays match, thats for sure, Djokovic said. He (Soderling) had nothing to lose. I think its his first Masters Cup. He won four straight sets and absolutely deserved to qualify for the semi-finals. I think hes the best player so far in the tournament.

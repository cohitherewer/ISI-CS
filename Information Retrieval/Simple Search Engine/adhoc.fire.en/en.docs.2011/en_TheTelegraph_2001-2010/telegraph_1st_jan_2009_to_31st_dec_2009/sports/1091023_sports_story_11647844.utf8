                                                     Hussey: Ready for the challenge
  - Johnson looks forward to returning to the scene of his best bowling show       OUR CORRESPONDENT            Mike Hussey                                 
	Mumbai: Mike Hussey says he had anticipated the dip in form, which he suffered last season. But the man nicknamed Mr Cricket feels that what others call a slump is a matter of perception. The 34-year-old Australia vice-captain shared his views on his batting and cricket in general at a news conference Thursday.               
	The following are excerpts               
	You had a great start to your Test career and then went through a slump         
	Its about perception. After the kind of start I had (averaging 80-plus in his first season in Tests), when I had to prick myself on waking up every morning, I was kind of half-expecting it (the slump). So I didnt want to listen to the criticism I had faith in my ability.         
	Ponting believes you are the key to handling the Indian spinners         
	But I have to first see the fast bowlers through, right? I enjoy playing the spinners. It doesnt matter what the captain says or the media write, the matter is in the middle.         
	On India struggling to produce quality spinners         
	You have pretty good spinners. Harbhajan Singh is one of the best around and Amit Mishra has done well. These things go in a cycle. In Australia, you are not going to find another Glenn McGrath or Shane Warne in the next few years.         
	The Indian pacers have gone off the boil, too         
	They are all good bowlers. There always will be good and bad days and it could be frustrating when its bad. But from experience I know that when critics criticise, the good players will come up and make them eat humble pie.         
	The toughest aspect of playing in India         
	The heat I have tried to deal with it. The pitches and the noise. We get enough noise back home too, but it is nothing like what you experience in India The huge extremes probably make it the toughest.         
	You had a Bradmanesque average before the slump         
	I dont make too much of averages. The aim is always to play and win every Test for Australia because its tough to just get into the national side. .         
	Any special reason for being dubbed Mr Cricket         
	I can tell you there are plenty of Mr Crickets in the Australian dressing room. Skipper Ricky Ponting is himself one and Shane Warne was another. Somehow with me the label has stuck.             Mitchell Johnson      
	Mitchell Johnson will look to open a few old scars in the opening ODI at Vadodara on Sunday. Thats the venue where the ICC Player of the Year claimed his career-best figures of five for 26 in the 2007 series. Johnson, too, spoke to the media Thursday.                 
	The following are excerpts               
	On returning to his happy hunting ground         
	I dont think we have any advantage because we havent been there for a while. But the Indian crowd can get behind any team, probably more so when they see an Australian doing well. I am looking forward to playing there.         
	Indian batsmen, including Sachin Tendulkar, have been exposed against left-arm bowlers         
	I dont think so. They have got three left-arm seamers in the side and they must be used to it. And its different in each game, never the same. But yes, its always helpful if you are a left-arm seamer and get that angle going.         
	Whether the Player of the Year award came as a surprise         
	I remember telling (Peter) Siddle that probably the Ashes performance had gone against me. Then, eventually, I was surprised to get the award. I am quite proud of it.         
	You have made some changes to your action         
	At one stage it got too mechanical and I tried to get back my natural action. I wouldnt say too many changes; just making sure the front arm is pulling in and working on getting the wrist position right.

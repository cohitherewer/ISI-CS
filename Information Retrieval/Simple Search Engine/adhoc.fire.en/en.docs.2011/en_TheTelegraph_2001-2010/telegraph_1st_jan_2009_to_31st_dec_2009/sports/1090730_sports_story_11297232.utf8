The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Andrew will go out a loser, says Clarke
                                                   Andrew will go out a loser, says Clarke

	Birmingham: Australia may be 0-1 down in this Ashes series, but you would not know it from listening to Michael Clarke. Look out for a dramatic turnaround in this Test, Clarke warned on Tuesday, because the Australians are going to send Andrew Flintoff into Test retirement as a loser.         
	After two underwhelming months on tour, the legendary toughness of Australias cricketers is being tested to the limit. Their fastest bowler, Mitchell Johnson, has lost his radar, while their hotshot opening batsman, Phillip Hughes, has seen his technique unpicked by Englands seamers.         
	But none of this seems to be worrying Clarke, who insisted: We play our best cricket when the chips are down.         
	He is even hoping that Flintoff will be fit to play in all the remaining Tests, so that Australia can stage their comeback against the best-available England attack.         
	I hope Andrew is fit and ready to go, said Clarke. I hope he can finish the series. Unfortunately I think he will be finishing as a loser when we win the series!         
	Asked about the great lengths being taken by Englands medical staff to get Flintoff ready for the Test, Clarke replied: Why wouldnt you? Andrew is always up for the big contest and he seems to perform under pressure. No doubt he will be ready for Thursday.         
	We may be 1-0 down, but we know where we let ourselves down in the last two Tests, and where we need to improve. Im certain that if we play our best cricket well win this Test match.         
	While Englands all-rounder may be creaking physically, he has been peaking on the field. Which could hardly be said of Johnson, Flintoffs opposite number.         
	Australia had hoped that Johnson might outshine Flintoff as the dominant performer in this series.         
	But he has suffered a traumatic last couple of matches  first at Lords, and then at Northampton, where his match figures added up to 18.1-1-107-1.         
	Look back a couple of months, and Mitchell bowled outstandingly well against South Africa, said Clarke. He has done a fantastic job for us since Brett Lee has been out injured.

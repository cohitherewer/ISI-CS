	London: Nottingham Forest, struggling at the wrong end of the Championship (second division), scored the upset of the day when they crushed Premier League club Manchester City 3-0 in the FA Cup third round on Saturday.         
	Goals from Nathan Tyson, Robert Earnshaw and Joe Garner sent City, regarded as the worlds richest club after their summer takeover by oil-rich Arab billionaires, crashing to a humiliating defeat.         
	League One (third division) Hartlepool United also caused a major shock when they beat Premier League Stoke City 2-0 at Victoria Park to reach the fourth round for only the sixth time.         
	Southend United, also in League One, had an afternoon to remember by forcing a 1-1 draw at Chelsea with Peter Clarke equalising at Stamford Bridge in stoppage time on his 27th birthday.         
	FA Cup holders Portsmouth dominated for long periods against Championship side Bristol City who forced a replay back at Ashton Gate after a goalless draw at Fratton Park.         
	Premier League West Bromwich Albion were also held to a 1-1 draw by Peterborough United, the League One side managed by Manchester United manager Alex Fergusons son Darren.         
	There were no such problems for Arsenal who beat Championship side Plymouth Argyle 3-1 at the Emirates with two goals from Robin van Persie, or the other Premier League teams playing against lower league opposition.         
	Everton won 1-0 at fourth tier club Macclesfield Town with Leon Osman scoring a stunning winner, while two goals from Andy Johnson, the second in the 88th minute, gave Fulham a 2-1 win at Championship side Sheffield Wednesday.         
	West Ham United had an easier afternoon against last seasons beaten semi-finalists Barnsley with a 3-0 win at Upton Park.         
	Middlesbrough also made it to the last 32 with a 2-1 win over minor League Barrow with Afonso Alves scoring both their goals.         
	Sunderland gained revenge for their 4-1 home defeat to Bolton just over a month ago, with a 2-1 win at the Stadium of Light in one of Saturdays two all-Premier League ties.         
	Hull City and Newcastle United drew 0-0 while Tottenham Hotspur beat Wigan Athletic 3-1 in the third all-Premier League tie of the round on Friday night.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dev Varman fancies chances vs Russia 
                                                     Dev Varman fancies chances vs Russia 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Somdev Dev Varman                           
	Mumbai: Somdev Dev Varman Thursday said India have a legitimate chance of defeating Russia in the first round of the Davis Cup World Group next year.         
	India, who qualified for the World Group after a gap of 11 years, will travel to Moscow for the March 5-7 tie and can expect the toughest of playing conditions. But Somdev, who has signed up with Percept Talent Management, believes the scenario is not entirely bleak.         
	We always knew we are going to draw a tough team. Its the World Group after all. Playing Russia in Russia means its probably going to be indoor clay and its going to be very cold, Somdev told reporters.         
	But we legitimately have a shot. With Leander (Paes) and Mahesh (Bhupathi) in, we have to win the doubles.         
	Rohan (Bopanna) can play some good tennis; he took a set out of Fernando Gonzalez (in the Kuala Lumpur ATP Tour event). And I can play now and then.         
	We definitely can compete. I just hope fitness is not an issue. Let me not lie, they are the stronger team, but strange things happen in sport.         
	Somdev, about to complete his first full year on the Tour, said he was learning to handle his emotions.         
	Its been a real emotional roller-coaster. On the days you win it feels great. But less than 24 hours later, you are out on court and lose to someone. Then no one really cares who you are, he said.         
	I have been learning to handle these highs and lows and thats what the top players are good at, they know to handle these situations.         
	The Assam-born player said that although his ranking has steadily gone up to 124, he did not have an eye on that. Ranking is just a number, he said.         
	There have been times when I was playing well and the ranking slipped. Then, when I was not doing well, it went up. Its the long term that I am looking at.         
	We athletes normally peak at 26-28, and I am 24 now. So I have got another five-six years left in me and I want to give my best shot.         
	Somdev, who is based in the US, said he would look to spend more time in India from now on, both for reasons commercial and tennis-related.         
	Born and brought up here, I want to give back, not just to the sport, but to the country, he said.         
	I want to make sure I dont get carried away, that I dont become too big for my boots. What I want to do is not really on the top of my head right now, but I want to influence people and motivate kids.         
	Hopefully I can make a difference to peoples lives.

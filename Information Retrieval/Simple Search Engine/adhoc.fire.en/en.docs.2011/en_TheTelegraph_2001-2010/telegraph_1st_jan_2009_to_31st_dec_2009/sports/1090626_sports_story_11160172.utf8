The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Razzaq: ICL affected my fitness 
                                                   CRICKET BRIEFS 
                      
	 Razzaq: ICL affected my fitness
    Karachi: Abdul Razzaq said that the transition from Indian Cricket League (ICL) to mainstream cricket has not been easy as being away from international circuit for almost two years has affected his fitness.         
	I would say it was a satisfying comeback but it is not easy shifting from ICL to international cricket. There is a big difference. I am now working hard on my fitness and hopefully by the end of the tour of Sri Lanka I would be back to my best fitness standards, Razzaq said. I missed playing for Pakistan. The ICL was one way of satisfying my passion for cricket. It also helped me financially but I think in hindsight I would not repeat the same mistake, he added.               
	 Lillee rsquo;s advice
    Chennai: Indias Twenty20 World Cup debacle cannot be blamed solely on the Indian Premier League (IPL) as the cricketers fatigue was an accumulated result of their overcrowded calendar, feels Australian pace legend Dennis Lillee,         
	I do not think that it is just that. It is a combination of all the cricket that is being played and not just one tournament, Lillee said Thursday. In order to protect fast bowlers in the long term considering the amount of cricket being played these days, it is more pertinent now that the respective cricket boards have to come out with a rotation system used in baseball for pitchers, he added.               
	 Colin honour
    London: Former England skipper Colin Cowdrey has been formally inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. Cowdrey, who led England in 27 Tests, was inducted during a memorial lecture at Lords, Wednesday.         
	In a career spanning 21-years, he scored 7,624 runs in 114 Tests averaging 44.06. Cowdreys son Chris, the former England, Glamorgan and Kent player, received the cap on behalf of his father.               
	 Symmo out
    Sydney: Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds was not included in the Queensland squad for the 2009-10 Australian season by Queensland Cricket Thursday.         
	Symonds, whose management said he is deciding on his future plans after also fielding interest from England and South Africa, previously advised Queensland Cricket not to include him on their contract list for next season.               
	 Sunny lecture
    Mumbai: Almost four decades after partnering the late Dilip Sardesai to pilot India to a historic Test series win in the West Indies, Sunil Gavaskar will deliver a lecture in the memory of his former teammate.         
	Gavaskar will deliver the inaugural Dilip Sardesai Memorial Lecture at the Cricket Club of India on July 2.               
	 Gilly view
    London: Cricket and Olympic need each other to spread wings and Twenty20 is the tailor-made format to achieve the common goal said former Australia wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist.

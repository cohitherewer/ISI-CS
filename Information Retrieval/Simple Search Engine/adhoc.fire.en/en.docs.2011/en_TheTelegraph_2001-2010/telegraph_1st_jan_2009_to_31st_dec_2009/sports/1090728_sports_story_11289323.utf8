            A STAFF REPORTER    
	Calcutta: Leander Paes had reasons to celebrate as his team, the Washington Kastles, defeated the Springfield Lasers 23-20, to lift their first World TeamTennis Championship in Washington on Sunday.         
	Paes, the Male Most Valuable Player, had a major role in the final as he, with his respective partners, contributed 10 points to the total of 23.         
	The Kastles led from start to finish in the five-match final.         
	In the opening mens singles, Scott Oudsema served three aces en route to a 5-3 win over Springfields Raven Klaasen.         
	Then, the top two mixed doubles teams of the event faced off in the second match. Paes, with partner Rennae Stubbs, played Martin Damm and Liezel Huber. The Lasers went up a break when Paes double-faulted in the opening game. However, the Kastles immediately broke Damms serve to make it 1-1.         
	Damm held serve the next time around to bring the score back to 3-3. After the score was 4-4, the Kastles rolled through the tie-breaker 5-1 for a 5-4 set win and an overall 10-7 lead.         
	The Kastles extended their lead when Paes and Oudsema edged past Damm and Klaasen 5-4 in the mens doubles to take a 15-11 lead into half-time.         
	It was then the turn of the womens teams. Lasers Vania King teamed up with Huber to close the gap to two games with a 5-3 win over Olga Puchkova and Stubbs in womens doubles.         
	In womens singles, which was to settle the issue, Puchkova saved three match points to beat King in the final set, leading the Washington team to a 23-20 victory.         
	Puchkova and King traded nervous service breaks in the first two games of the final set. King rallied to a 4-2 lead and three championship points before Puchkova staged her comeback to win the final and the championship.         
	Puchkova credited her team and the Kastles crowd for pushing her to victory. It was amazing, it was awesome, said Puchkova of the crowd that chanted her name after she closed out King for the win. The win boosted my confidence a lot. Hopefully this year I can build on this experience.         
	Kastles team owner Mark Ein called it the most exciting match he had ever seen. Its a dream come true to win this in front of our fans, Ein said.         
	The Advanta WTT Finals MVP was the Kastles Scott Oudsema who had the highest winning percentage of any player in the final.

	Miami: Jeev Milkha Singhs dreams of laying his hands on the WGC-CA Championship title didnt materialise but his cultured final round of two-under 70 was enough for a fourth place finish in the elite $8.5 million event here.         
	Jeev signed off with an aggregate of four-under 274, five shots behind Phil Mickelson who shrugged off a bout of exhaustion and dehydration and crawled out of the bed to lift the title.         
	Jeev, the reigning Asia No. 1, pocketed a cool $360,000 cheque for his exploits at the Doral Golf Resort and Spa.         
	Jeev went into the final round at third place and the birdie in the opening hole promised a spirited challenge by the Indian.         
	Birdies came on the fifth and seventh as well but were summarily cancelled out by the bogeys on the fourth and eighth and the Indian made the turn at one-under.         
	On his way back, Jeev birdied the 12th and 16th holes but the 13th proved unlucky for him as he dropped a stroke there and it left him at two-under. Jeev parred the last five holes to finish three shots ahead of the iconic Tiger Woods.         
	I could have done better but Im happy with my performance, said Jeev, who is in pursuit of his first triumph on the USPGA Tour.         
	Those boys up front were superb and were way past us after nine holes, he said, admitting his prospects of winning the title was over by the time he was through his front nine.         
	I made too many errant shots to contend, but that is part of the game, Jeev said.         
	I holed some putts I wasnt supposed to, so I will definitely take the fourth place here, he added.         
	Mickelson won the WGC-CA Championship by a shot from fellow American Nick Watney, battling dehydration as well as nerves to triumph at Doral.         
	In a head-to-head duel between the two overnight leaders, Watney paid the price for bogeys on 11 and 12, which followed his eagle on the par-five tenth.         
	Mickelsons three-under round of 69 allowed him to finish the tournament on 19-under overall and claim his second tour win of the year and his first at a World Golf Championship event.         
	The left-hander had to receive a drip at a clinic after Saturdays third round due to dehydration and Mickelson said he had been far from well.         
	I havent eaten much in three days, so I really wasnt able to appreciate what others were doing but Nick played some great shots and I was very relieved to come out on top, Mickelson told reporters.         
	It was an enthralling battle between the two Americans who broke free of the rest of the leader-board early on.         
	Once Mickelson had his nose in front, Watney was unable to pull back the shot as both players made par on each of the last six holes.         
	The 27-year-old Watney, who had made just one bogey all week before his three Sunday, had an outside chance at birdie on the last but his 29-foot putt fell just inches short.         
	Watney covered his face with his hat as he realised his slight chance of glory had passed and he was visibly upset with the outcome.         
	World No.1 Tiger Woods, in his first stroke-play event since an eight-month layoff following knee surgery, finished on 11 under-par after his 68 on Sunday, enough to tie for ninth.         
	Woods has never finished out of the top 10 in 28 WGC starts. The good news is, I got better each and every day, said Woods.         
	Jim Furyk finished third after a fine back-nine of five-under 31 to finish three shots behind Mickelson. (AGENCIES)

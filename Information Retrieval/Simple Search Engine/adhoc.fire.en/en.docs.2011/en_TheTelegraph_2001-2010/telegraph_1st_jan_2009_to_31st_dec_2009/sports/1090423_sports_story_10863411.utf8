The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | John finds an ally in Siddons
                                                   John finds an ally in Siddons
                      
	Dhaka: John Buchanans controversial multiple captain theory has been backed by his former assistant in the Australia team and present Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons, who intends using a similar plan for Bangladesh to take the pressure off regular skipper Mohammed Ashraful.         
	I have a similar sort of plan for our boys too. I do see some merit in it, maybe it helps to take some pressure off Ashraful, maybe if Shakib (Al Hasan) and Mashrafe (Mortaza) could share a bit of responsibility. I see a bit of merit in it, because of our skippers inexperience. But it needs the boards approval and we havent got that yet, Siddons was quoted as saying by a newspaper.         
	We have a good leadership group. There is enough pressure in the team like talking to you guys (journalists) after every win or loss. So if we go for the multiple captaincy, that can help Ashraful because some pressure will be taken off him, added the Victorian, who was assistant to Buchanan during Australias 2005 Ashes tour of England.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Diwakar slams four goals
                                                   Diwakar slams four goals
                      
	Sydney: Captain Diwakar Ram slammed four goals including two late strikes to help India grind out a 5-5 draw against Malaysia in an inconsequential final league match of the mens hockey event in the Australian Youth Olympic Festival here Saturday.         
	In a high-scoring crowd stunner at the Hockey Centre, Sydney Olympic Park here, Diwakar converted four penalty corners to save the day for the Indians.         
	The two sides were level 3-3 at interval with Diwakar contributing two goals. He then converted two penalty corners in the final nine minutes after his side had been trailing 3-5 till the 61st minute.         
	The Indian colts will now take on Australia, whom they have defeated in their earlier league encounter, in the summit clash Sunday.         
	In the girls event, India registered their first victory of the tournament, beating USA 2-0, though the result came too late as the girls are already out of contention for the summit clash after losing their first two matches. They will be up against US in the bronze medal match.         
	In the pulsating boys encounter, India took the lead in the seventh minute through Jay Karan but Malaysia equalised when Abdul Gaffar found the net two minutes later from a short corner. Diwakar doubled the lead in the 19th minute.

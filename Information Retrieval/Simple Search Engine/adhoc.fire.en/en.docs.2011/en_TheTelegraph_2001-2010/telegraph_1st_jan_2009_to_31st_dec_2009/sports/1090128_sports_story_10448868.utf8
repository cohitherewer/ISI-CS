The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting takes blame
                                                   Ponting takes blame
                      
	Melbourne: Australia have been on the losing side for the most part of this season but the eight-wicket defeat against South Africa in Adelaide was the worst of the summer, says skipper Ricky Ponting.         
	By a long way ... right through the Test series and then the first three games of this series, wed been right in the contest right up until the last over or the last couple of overs of every game, he was quoted as saying in an Australian Broadcasting Corporation report.         
	South Africa became the first team since 1993 to beat Australia at home both in the Test and ODI series.         
	The Proteas have an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match ODI series after they won the Test series 2-1.         
	Ponting said he wasnt too happy with his own batting form despite being the top run-scorer for Australia in the one-day matches.         
	The four games that weve played, Ive got 46, 60-odd, 60-odd and 30. So, for me, in a No.3 position, its not good enough, he said.         
	On Monday, Australia put up yet another sordid batting display and folded up for 222 in 48 overs with only Ricky Ponting (63), James Hopes (42) and Cameron White (30) salvaging some individual reputation with the bat.         
	Chasing 223, South Africa needed 38.1 overs to reach the target with Hashim Amla (80 not out), A.B. de Villiers (82 not out) starring in the chase.           (AGENCIES)

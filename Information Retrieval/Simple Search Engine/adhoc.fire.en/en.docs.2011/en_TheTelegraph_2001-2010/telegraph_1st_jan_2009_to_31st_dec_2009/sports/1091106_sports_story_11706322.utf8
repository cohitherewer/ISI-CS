The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A special achievement: Saurasish
                                                                                                                                   A special achievement: Saurasish
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: If Bengal manage to garner full points in their Ranji Trophy opener against Maharashtra, much of the credit will go to Saurasish Lahiri who picked up four crucial wickets on Thursday.         
	The off-spinner ran through the Maharashtra middle order taking the steam out of the hosts resistance. And, had it not been for skipper Harshad Khadiwales defiant 114, Maharashtra could have been in bigger trouble.         
	Saurasish was even more satisfied with the effort because his third wicket of the day completed his 200 wickets in the domestic circuit. It was special and its a great achievement When I had started my career, I had never imagined that I would come this far. So its really special, he said.         
	With Maharashtra leading by 159 runs with three wickets in hand, Saurasish said he was confident that Bengal will return victorious. Its an excellent batting track and, like most Western India wickets, is quite firm. The pitch hasnt cracked yet. Given the form that our batsmen are in, I dont think chasing a target around 200 runs would be a problem. We are playing well in this match, he said.         
	However, the off-spinner was quick to remind: But we will have to get rid of their last three wickets quickly in the morning session. We all are hopeful of a positive result. He was also all praise for the other bowlers in the team. All of us bowled well. Ranadeb picked up three and Shibsagar, though didnt pick any wickets, bowled excellently, Saurasish signed off.

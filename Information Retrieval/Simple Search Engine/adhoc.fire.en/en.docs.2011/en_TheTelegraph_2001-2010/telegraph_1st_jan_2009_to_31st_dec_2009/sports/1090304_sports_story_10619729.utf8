The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Good start was the key: Dhoni
                                                   Good start was the key: Dhoni
                      
	Napier: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni Tuesday lauded the opening pair of Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar for having laid the foundation for the 53-run victory over New Zealand in the first cricket one-dayer here.         
	Dhoni said the difference between victory and defeat today was the 69-run opening stand between Sehwag and Tendulkar which allowed the middle-order batsmen to free their arms in the later stages.         
	I think the start was important for us. Over the years we have seen that if we get a decent start, we have the firepower to capitalise on that and, especially with the 20 overs of Powerplay, it gets really very difficult for the bowlers to contain us.         
	If we get a good start, more often than not, we will get a good score which our bowlers can defend, he said after the match.         
	The openers role is very important, but I think Rainas knock was fabulous. He came in at a time when he had to decide whether to go after the bowling or not. I think it was a brilliant innings, he added.         
	Asked whether the Indians came out with a different gameplan Tuesday after the two Twenty20 defeats, he said: During the toss I have said it has happened to us in the past. In the Twenty20 games we tend to go out all guns blazing and at times we fall short of the target, but our 50 overs approach has been good.         
	Dhoni, adjudged Man-of-the-Match for his tactical innings, also lauded pacer Praveen Kumar.         
	Meanwhile, New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori blamed his bowlers for the defeat.         
	Right from the start, India outplayed us. We just couldnt get it right with the ball. I was pretty disappointed with the way we bowled, we are a lot better as a bowling unit than what we have displayed today (Tuesday).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev falters, hits a one-over 71
                                                   Jeev falters, hits a one-over 71
                            
	Akron (US): A poor back-nine marred Jeev Milkha Singhs card as he turned in a one-over 71 to slip to the tied 36th spot after the second round of the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational on Friday.         
	The seasoned Indian pro, playing his first tournament after being laid low by a rib injury for three weeks, has total of one-over 141 after two rounds at the Firestone Country Club.         
	A 10th tee starter, Jeev parred five holes on the trot before stumbling to a triple-bogey on the 16th. He managed a birdie on the next hole but dropped a stroke on the 18th to make the turn three-over.         
	His front nine was markedly better as he picked up two birdies on the first and fifth and didnt drop a single bogey to make some amends for the back-nine slump.         
	Meanwhile, Padraig Harrington played patiently on a course that is becoming increasingly difficult to negotiate to take a one-shot lead.         
	Bidding for his first victory of the year on any of the leading tours, the Irishman followed his opening 64 with a one-under-par 69 on a tree-lined layout running fast and firm.         
	Two ahead overnight, Harrington mixed two birdies with a sole bogey to post a seven-under total of 133 in the final World Golf Championships (WGC) event of the season. (AGENCIES)

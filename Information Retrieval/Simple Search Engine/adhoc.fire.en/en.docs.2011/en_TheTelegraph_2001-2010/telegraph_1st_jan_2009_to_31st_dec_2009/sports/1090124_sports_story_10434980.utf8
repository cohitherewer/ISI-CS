The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Erratic Ana bites dust
                                                   Erratic Ana bites dust
  - Federer tames Safin in three sets 
  -   Dokic shows 11th seed the door
                      
	Melbourne: Ana Ivanovics hopes of a return trip to the Australian Open final fell apart in a barrage of mistakes on Friday as Russias Alisa Kleybanova ousted her 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 6-2 in the third round.         
	With 19-year-old Kleybanova constantly aggressive, fifth-ranked Ivanovic lost her serve nine times and finished with 50 unforced errors to just 23 winners.         
	When it was over, Kleybanova dropped to both knees, pumped her fists and blew kisses at the crowd. Ivanovic appeared to be nearly in tears as she walked off court.         
	The Serbs loss came on a day that the late match between second-ranked Roger Federer against former No. 1 Marat Safin  which the Swiss star won in three sets  was supposed to produce the biggest news.         
	Instead, ethnic violence erupted between nationalist fans after Serbias Novak Djokovic, the defending mens champion, beat Bosnian-born American Amer Delic.         
	Instead of talking about how defending champion Djokovic reached the third round with a 6-2, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) victory packed with drama and good sportsmanship  the 21-year-old Serb and Bosnian-born Delic were mostly quizzed about the chaotic scene that followed, when their supporters clashed outside near a big-screen TV showing the match.         
	 Djokovic next plays 2006 runner-up Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus, who beat American Mardy Fish, the No. 23 seed, 6-2, 6-4, 6-4 in a match that didnt end until 1:13 a.m. Baghdatis is unseeded and ranked 97th after playing in only 12 tournaments last year due to wrist and back injuries.         
	And that wasnt even all of the days drama  a man was arrested after dancing across a court, naked from the waist down, as Serena and Venus Williams won a second-round doubles match.         
	The rematch of the 2005 mens semi-final here, won by Safin en route to the championship, was dominated by Federer, who again looked sharp in his pursuit of a 14th Grand Slam title that would tie Pete Sampras record, winning 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (7-5).         
	Federer never faced a breakpoint, and the mercurial Safins growing frustration nearly boiled over when he was called for a foot-fault on his second serve. That gave him a double-fault and Federer a 4-1 lead in the third-set tiebreaker. Safin rallied to lead 5-4 before Federer ran off the last three points, the last on a backhand winner down the line.         
	He gave me quite a few free points in the first two sets, but after that he got tougher, Federer said. Im pretty lucky I got through in three.         
	Safin has said he is unlikely to continue playing after this year. Federer clearly would miss him.         
	After dropping the first set, 21-year-old Ivanovic lost her first two service games in the second, falling behind 0-3. She rallied to force a tiebreaker, where both women were pumping their fists after every point they won. Ivanovic did a three-punch combination after whacking an overhead winner on set point.         
	The jubilation was short-lived: Ivanovic found herself facing 0-3 again in the deciding set and never caught up. Serving at 2-5, she fell behind 0-40.         
	She saved one match point with a high, lunging volley winner before Kleybanova hit a forehand crosscourt that went untouched to end the match in 2 hours and 43 minutes.         
	Kleybanova, who reached the fourth round at Wimbledon last year in her third Grand Slam, dropped to her knees in relief and disbelief.         
	Roddick had a 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 win over Fabrice Santoro.         
	No. 8 Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina extended his winning streak to seven matches, and No. 19 Marin Cilic of Croatia ousted No. 11 David Ferrer of Spain.         
	On the womens side, Olympic silver medallist Safina beat No. 25 Kaia Kanepi of Estonia. Fellow Russians Vera Zvonareva, seeded seventh, and No. 10 Nadia Petrova are also in the fourth round.         
	Unseeded Jelena Dokic, a former Wimbledon semi-finalist making her first appearance in the main draw of a Grand Slam after a three-year absence, knocked off a seeded player for the second straight round, ousting 11th seed Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark.

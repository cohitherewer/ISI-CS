	Margao: Lajong FC coach Stanley Rozario will be looking to turn things around for another upset win when they meet Dempo Sports Club in the third round I-League match at the Nehru stadium on Sunday.         
	Lajong executed their plan to perfection to down Sporting Clube de Goa, and secure their first win in the league.         
	The morale of the boys is high and they are full of confidence following the win against Sporting. They are now ready to face another tough opponent in Dempo, who are one of the title contenders, Rozario said.         
	Meanwhile, Dempo who have four points from two games will field the same side that played the last match.         
	We are playing them for the first time and hence need to be extra careful and guard against complacency, said coach Armando Colaco.         
	Lajongs likely to adopt a defensive game to frustrate their opponents, who have a strong midfield and good strikers.         
	The hosts will be looking forward to their midfield general Brazilian Beto.         
	Winger Anthony Fernandes has shown a lot of promise on the right flank to keep the rival defense on their toes.           (PTI)

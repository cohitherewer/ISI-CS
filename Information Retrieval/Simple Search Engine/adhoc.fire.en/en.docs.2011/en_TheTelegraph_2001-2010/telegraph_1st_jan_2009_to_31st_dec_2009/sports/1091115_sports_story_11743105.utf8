                                                                                                                                     Cup hopes rest on Sachin: Sourav
  - A lot of people are talented, but he made full use of his talent       A STAFF REPORTER            Sourav Ganguly                                   
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly was the captain when India lost the World Cup final to Australia in 2003.         
	And in the 2011 Cup, Sourav feels there is every reason for the country to hope for a triumph. Why? Thats because Sachin Tendulkar, in all probability, will be around.         
	With Sachin around, we are keeping our fingers crossed for the 2011 Cup. I hope he puts up a stellar performance and we do well, said Sourav, on Saturday.         
	He also congratulated the maestro on his 20 glorious years in international cricket, saying that it has been an amazing journey for the man from Mumbai.         
	I have already congratulated him Starting at the age of 16 and continuing successfully for 20 years is unbelievable. I just hope he carries on It has been wonderful, said the former India captain.         
	Recalling his first meeting with Sachin, the former India captain said that he was aware of the masters genius from day one. I have known him for a long time ... since our under-15 years. I first met him during an under-15 camp organised by Vasu Paranjpe. The first day I met him, I knew that he was special, Sourav said.         
	Sachin is the best batsman I have seen. A lot of people are talented, but he ensured that he made full use of his talent. That is why he is so successful, he added.         
	Asked about his memories of his former opening partner, the left-hander said that there were too many for him to single out.         
	There are so many memories of our playing days Im fortunate to have played more than 400 matches alongside him, said Sourav.         
	He picked Sachins blistering 175 against Australia in the fifth match of the recently concluded ODI series as the best he has seen from the little master.         
	That innings in Hyderabad against Australia was amazing He played such a terrific knock and probably its the best ODI innings I have seen from Sachin, observed Sourav.         
	For the record, Sachin crossed the 17,000-run mark in ODIs during his whirlwind knock at Hyderabad.

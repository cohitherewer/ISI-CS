The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gibbs likely to retire
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gibbs likely to retire
                      
	Johannesburg: Controversial South African opener Herschelle Gibbs may quit international cricket after being left out of the one-day International (ODI) team against England but will remain available for his Indian Premier League side the Deccan Chargers.         
	Quoting an unnamed source close to Gibbs, a South African newspaper said Gibbss decision had nothing to do with the fact that he has been omitted (from the national side) for the umpteenth time.         
	Although he still has to weigh up a few choices, (Gibbs) feels that he has had enough after such a long career, the source was quoted as saying.         
	Neither Gibbs nor his agent Donne Commins have commented on the report.         
	South Africa coach Mickey Arthur too has denied any knowledge of the development, remaining adamant that Gibbs was part of his plan for the 2011 World Cup.         
	Gibbs has had an eventful international career of 13 years, often at the centre of controversies ranging from match-fixing to substance abuse. However, he is still regarded as one of the best opening batsmen in the world.         
	But Gibbss batting has been inconsistent in recent years, with his last ODI century coming in April this year against the Australians in Port Elizabeth.         
	The opener has also been dogged by scandals on and off the field. He was kicked out of the national squad last year and sent to a rehabilitation centre for alcohol abuse.

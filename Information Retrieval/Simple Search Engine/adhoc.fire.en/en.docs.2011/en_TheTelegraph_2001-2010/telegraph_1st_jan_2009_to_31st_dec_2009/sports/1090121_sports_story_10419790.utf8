	Karachi: Opening batsman Salman Butt hit an unbeaten century and seamer Rao Iftikhar took a career-best four for 42 on Tuesday to give Pakistan an eight-wicket win over Sri Lanka in the first limited-overs international.         
	Butt made a polished 100 off 117 balls with 13 fours as Pakistan reached 220 for two in 45.5 overs after Sri Lanka were bowled out for 219.         
	Pakistan lead 1-0 in the three-match series.         
	Iftikhar was supported by Umar Gul, who took three for 30 with Kumar Sangakkara top-scoring with 49 for Sri Lanka.         
	Butt and Khurram Manzoor, who hit 83 with nine fours in 127 balls, put on an opening stand of 168 despite facing two of the worlds best spinners in Muttiah Muralidharan and Ajantha Mendis.         
	We made a few plans against them and it worked out well for us, Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik said.         
	The second match will be played on Wednesday in Karachi before Lahore hosts the final game on Saturday.         
	Iftikhar and Gul ran through Sri Lankas batting line-up after Sanath Jayasuriya (42) and Tillekeratne Dilshan (38) had put on an opening stand of 71 off 53 balls.         
	Gul provided the initial breakthrough by getting rid off Dilshan and Jayasuriya. Fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar wasnt able to impress in his comeback one-day International after 13 months out, finishing with none for 43 off seven overs.

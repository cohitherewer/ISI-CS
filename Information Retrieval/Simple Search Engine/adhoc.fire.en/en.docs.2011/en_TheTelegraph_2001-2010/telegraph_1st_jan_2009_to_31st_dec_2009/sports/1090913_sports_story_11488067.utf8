	The International Cricket Council led the way in mourning the death of former Board of Control for Cricket in India president (BCCI), Raj Singh Dungarpur, who passed away on Saturday. The BCCI, former cricketers and former BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya also condoled the death of Dungarpur, a respected cricket administrator.               
	The following are excerpts               
	ICC: Raj Singh Dungarpur was an extraordinary person with extraordinary talent and ability. He was an institution from which plenty of stars have graduated.         
	SHASHANK MANOHAR: It is a great loss to Indian cricket. Rajbhai served Indian cricket diligently and with distinction, in several capacities. He always put the sport, and Indian cricket in particular, above everything else.         
	DILIP VENGSARKAR: I am yet to come across a more passionate cricket lover than Rajbhai who breathed and ate cricket. I was a member of the teams to Pakistan and England (1984-85, 1986) when he was the manager. He was hugely popular in those places, especially at Lords, which he used to visit regularly.         
	BAPU NADKARNI: He was a dear friend of mine and Pollys (Umrigar). He was crazy about the game and was very helpful to cricketers. The greatest example of it is Salim Durrani. He was the one who helped him (in times of difficulties).         
	JAGMOHAN DALMIYA: No one can take away his contribution to Indian cricket. He was associated with the game for over 50 years and was an institution in himself. We shared some great moments together and his passing away has left a void which will be difficult to fill.

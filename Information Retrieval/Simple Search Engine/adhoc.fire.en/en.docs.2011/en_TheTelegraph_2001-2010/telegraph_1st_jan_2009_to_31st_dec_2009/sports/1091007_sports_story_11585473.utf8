The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IBF likely   to revoke   ban on Marykom 
                                                     IBF likely   to revoke   ban on Marykom 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT     
	Jamshedpur: The Indian Boxing Federation (IBF) is likely to revoke the temporary suspension slapped on MC Marykom who had kicked up a storm after her shock defeat to a lesser-known boxer in the 10th Senior Women National Boxing Championship Monday.         
	Col PK Muralidharan Raja, the secretary general of the IBF who arrived in the city on Tuesday evening, went through the report of the jury and the judges score sheet. He also spoke to Marykom and tried to know about the genesis of the whole problem.         
	Raja said he was satisfied with the verdict given by the judges. Prima facie decision of the judges was correct. They (judges) went through the earmarked criteria and came out with the right decision of declaring Pinki Jangra the winner. I have also asked for video clippings of the bout, he added.         
	On his one-on-one with Marykom, the IBF secretary general stated that her reaction seemed to be spontaneous and taken on the spur of the moment.         
	Marykom told me that things were okay when she came down from the ring. She had accepted her defeat but something went terribly wrong after that, which led her to go at the panel of judges. Emotions run high in boxing and things sometimes go out of control, Raja added.         
	According to him, Marykom has not tendered any apology so far. Her suspension could be revoked if she tenders an apology. The panel of jury can revoke Marykoms suspension, Raja said.         
	He added that would be addressing the participating boxers Wednesday to explain them the essentials of good behaviour.         
	The senior IBF functionary stated that Marykom was the brand ambassador of boxing who has never lost bouts in any national championships. She is also a part of the six-member India squad for the upcoming Indoor Asian Games to be held at Hanoi in Vietnam later this month.         
	He indicated that the IBF might have to review the issue (suspension) as the Indian team is supposed to depart for Hanoi on October 29. Raja said indiscipline will not be tolerated. Abusing the judges was not correct.         
	Meanwhile, Jangra stormed into the light flyweight final Tuesday after trouncing Hemani Mehta 18-6. She will take on Krishna Thapa in the final.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | For me, country comes first, says Laxman
                                                                                                                                   For me, country comes first, says Laxman
    - Only regret is missing the 2003 World Cup, reveals stylish right-hander           INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                                              VVS Laxman          
	Hyderabad: Vangipurappu Venkata Sai Laxman has performed consistently for India since making his Test debut in November 1996. True to form, he was among Indias top-three batsmen in their last Test series, in New Zealand.         
	Apart from a brief spell in the late Nineties, his career graph has been pretty stable. The 35-year-old spoke to The Telegraph at the Gymkhana ground (he pulled out of the Hyderabad-Himachal Ranji match because of a stiff back) on Thursday morning.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Nearly 13 years of international cricket         
	The journey has been excellent and Ive enjoyed every moment of it Most importantly, I got the chance to play for India for so many years. Its always been my dream to play for the country and Im happy that Ive achieved it to the fullest.         
	The secret of performing consistently         
	The motivation has always been there to do well for the country. Playing match-winning and match-saving innings gives me a lot of satisfaction. More importantly, to consistently perform for the country For me, the country comes first. That always keeps me motivated.         
	Producing match-saving and match-winning knocks with such regularity         
	I think the best comes out of me when the team needs my services badly I like excelling under such circumstances. Ive always relished and enjoyed such situations and that gives me extra motivation and satisfaction.         
	The forthcoming series versus Sri Lanka         
	With both aiming to be the No.1 nation in world cricket, its going to be very competitive. If we can beat them convincingly in this series, our chances will improve a lot. Both teams have the same potential with a very good bowling attack. They are also used to the conditions in the subcontinent, which means no one will have an edge. Its going to be tough         
	The Test specialist tag         
	Its been there for close to three years now, during which I didnt get an opportunity to play one-day cricket for the country. Im totally focusing on Tests. However, its sometimes frustrating when you dont get to play too many matches. But that is the way the calendar is planned. But Im happy that Im playing active cricket in the sense that I played for Lancashire, in the Champions League T20 and now the Ranji Trophy. All this has helped me stay fit.         
	Twenty20         
	Its a great concept. T20 is full of entertainment and I enjoy playing and watching this form. Im sure this will get better and better in the future. It will not only draw people who understand the game but also who dont because its a very good family package. You can come and spend a quality three to four hours at the ground. Not just entertaining cricket, you are also part of other amusements during the match and the break.         
	If Tests are under threat from T20s and ODIs         
	I dont think Tests will be threatened but one-dayers are sure to feel the heat. At the same time, I know the ICC is taking steps to make the one-dayers more interesting. In the current India-Australia series, most matches so far have gone down to the wire.         
	Whether he has been denied a fair run in the one-dayers         
	Im quite happy with what Ive achieved in one-dayers (2,338 runs in 86 matches), and I dont want to get into whether I should have been given more chances Being a permanent member of the Test side is fine with me.         
	If theres too much cricket         
	Personally, for me, not much (laughs) But for those who are involved in all forms, its quite a hectic schedule. Youve to work hard on your fitness and recover well so that you are fresh for the matches. For a professional, its important that youre ready for the responsibility. The fact that you are representing your country will help you get over the tiredness and ensure youre fit, physically and mentally.         
	The spate of injuries in the Australian side         
	Injuries are part and parcel of any sport, not just cricket. Its a physical activity and its bound to affect your body. Its wrong to blame it on just too much cricket         
	Regrets         
	The only regret is missing the 2003 World Cup. In fact, I havent played any World Cup. But Im happy with what Ive got. Theres always scope for improvement and achieving more, and Im striving to do that.         
	Keenness to improve         
	If you dont seek to improve and set new goals, youll stagnate. Thats why I always strive for improvement.         
	The 281 against Australia at the Eden, in 2001         
	One of my best innings definitely the best series Ive been part of. It was played with such intensity and changed the mindset of the entire team. It gave us the confidence that we can bounce back and win from any situation.         
	Finally, on performing well against Australia         
	Getting runs consistently against the top team is a great feeling. But playing match-winning knocks under pressure has given me the most satisfaction. Not just Australia, I have played match-winning knocks against Pakistan, the West Indies and New Zealand too.

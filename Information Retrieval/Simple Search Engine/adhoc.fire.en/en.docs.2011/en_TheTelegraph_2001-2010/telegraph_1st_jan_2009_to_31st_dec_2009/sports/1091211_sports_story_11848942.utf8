	Kanpur: The good work done by the Bengal bowlers when they bundled out Uttar Pradesh (UP) for a paltry 62 in the first innings ultimately went to vain due to the failure of their batsmen.         
	Uttar Pradesh, chasing a target of 236, were helped by a half-century by Parvinder Singh (62). A 93-run stand between Parvinder and captain Mohammed Kaif also helped them beat Bengal by three wickets inside three days in their Ranji Super League Group B match Thursday.         
	The dismal show by Bengal batsmen in their second innings (they managed a disappointing 104) proved fatal at the end as the hosts notched up full points on a pitch which had eased out considerably.         
	Needing 183 for a win Thursday and with eight wickets in hand, Uttar Pradesh lost overnight batsman Shivakant Shukla (19) in the first over of the morning when he was castled by Ranadeb Bose.         
	But Kaif and Parvinder frustrated the Bengal bowlers with a crucial partnership for the fourth wicket.         
	The duo rattled up their stand from 166 balls with Parvinder, who hit 10 fours in his 95-ball knock, outscoring his captain, whose 96-ball 44 was studded with six fours.         
	A glimmer of hope, however, propped up when Kaif and Parvinder were removed in quick succession. First Bose caught Kaif off his own bowling and then, 10 runs later, Parvinder departed caught by Rohan Gavaskar off Laxmi Ratan Shukla.         
	But Piyush Chawla and Bhubaneswar Kumar steadied the ship somewhat with a 43-run partnership. The stand took the breath out of the visitors and though they scalped two more wickets, Bhubaneswar and Chawla, Praveen Gupta hit a 16-ball 18 to ensure victory for the hosts.         
	Gupta, in fact, hit four consecutive boundaries off Sourav Sarkar to lead his team to the target.         
	For Bengal, Bose, who had a five-wicket haul in the first innings, was once again among the wickets as he pocketed three for 68. Shukla and Sarkar grabbed two wickets each.

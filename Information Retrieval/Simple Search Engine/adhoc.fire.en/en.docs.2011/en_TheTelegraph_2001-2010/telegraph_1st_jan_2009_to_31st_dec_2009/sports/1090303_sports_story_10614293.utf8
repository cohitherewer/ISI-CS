The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Title for Ogilvy 
                                                   Title for Ogilvy 
                      
	Marana (Arizona): Geoff Ogilvy won the Accenture Match Play Championship for the second time in four years with a 4-and-3 victory over Paul Casey of England to stake his claim as the best in the world at match play.         
	In a relentless performance at Dove Mountain, the 31-year-old Australian did not trail over the final 63 holes of the tournament and did not have a bogey on his card over the last 57 holes.         
	He took the lead with a 6-foot birdie on the first hole on Sunday of a 36-hole title match, and never gave Casey a chance. Ogilvy had a 3-up lead after the morning round, then shot 31 on the front nine to pull away.         
	A tournament that began with so much buzz over the return of Tiger Woods ended with a newfound appreciation for the match-play prowess of Ogilvy, who ran his career record to 18-3 in this fickle format.         
	Ogilvy won his third World Golf Championship  he will defend his title in two week at Doral in the CA Championship  the most of any player besides Woods, who has won 15 of these elite events.         
	Casey, who brought a 16-3-1 record in match play into the final, faced a 3-up deficit after the morning match and knew he had to play well to get back in the game. He birdied three of his next eight holes, and Ogilvy still stretched his lead to 5 up.         
	I have no excuses right now, Casey said.         
	Ogilvy closed him out with a 6-foot birdie on the 15th hole. He won $1.4 million and moves up to No. 4 in the world ranking. (AP)

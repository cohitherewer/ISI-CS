The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Prolific Raul in a league of his own
                                                   Prolific Raul in a league of his own
                      
	Gijon (Spain): Raul Gonzalez broke Real Madrids all-time scoring record Sunday, surpassing the previous mark of 307 goals in official competitions held by Alfredo di Stefano.         
	Raul scored twice in Madrids 4-0 win over Sporting Gijon in the Spanish league to take his tally over 15 seasons with the club to 309 goals.         
	The 31-year-old Madrid captain went one better than Di Stefano by turning in Sergio Ramoss short cross with the inside of his left foot in the 15th minute. He then seized on a loose rebound inside the box in the 76th to complete the scoring at El Molinon stadium.         
	Raul needed 504 competitive matches compared to Di Stefanos 401 to set the mark. He has scored 216 league goals  fifth-best on the all-time list  and 11 in 18 games this season.         
	Hes always in the first line of battle, Madrid coach Juande Ramos said. Hes the one who lays himself on the line, the one who carries the weight of the team and you can only congratulate him.         
	Raul is also Spains all-time leading scorer with 44 goals from 102 international matches, and is the all-time leading scorer in Uefa competitions with 66 goals, including a leading mark of 64 in the Champions League.         
	Raul, who was the Spanish leagues top-scorer in the 1998-99 and 2000-01 seasons, even has the record for minutes played having featured more than any other Madrid player.

                                                   Balance right, says Kirsten
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: India coach Gary Kirsten on Wednesday expressed confidence that Team India had the wherewithal to overcome tough challenges on the upcoming tour of New Zealand and record their first series win there in four decades.         
	India have not won in New Zealand since recording their first ever series win there, a 3-1 victory under Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, in 1967. That triumph, fashioned by the spin quartet, was also Indias maiden away victory.         
	Kirsten said that the Indian team has come a long way from relying only on their spinners, and now possessed the right combination to win under all conditions, not just in New Zealand.         
	The most exciting thing about this team is the balance. We not only have the spinners and batsmen but also the pacers who can win matches. We can play on any surface, under any condition, Kirsten said ahead of the teams departure in the wee hours of Friday.         
	India are to play two Twenty20 Internationals, five one-dayers and three Tests in New Zealand between February 25 and April 7. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said the key to the teams success would be how well they were prepared for the 47-day visit.         
	Every place has its demand and challenge. What we would try to do is provide everyone the right environment so that they can give their best, Dhoni said.         
	We are not thinking about the results. The important things are practice, planning and execution. Practice sessions are the most important. These are smaller things, which to me are very important I dont know how I am going to perform, nor does anybody else in the team. But we all know how well we are prepared.         
	Kirsten said that the team was worried about neither the lack of practice games nor the conditions.         
	We have four days to prepare (before the first ODI), and we have two T20s to tune ourselves ... international schedules are tight, the South African said. They play cricket throughout the year and we have to give them sufficient break. It is a fine balancing act but  we are not concerned at all.         
	With regard to conditions, we will go there and assess them. I have seen two different types of wickets there. When India played (in 2002-03), it was seaming, but when the West Indies went there (last year), it was pretty flat.         
	We have to understand the weather. It would be colder, and there could be a bit more rain, which will assist the seamers. But as I said, we have the balance and we are confident, regardless of what conditions we confront.         
	Dhoni, under whom India have beaten Australia and England at home, said the team would put themselves under pressure by looking at the New Zealand series in the context of attaining the world No.1 ranking.         
	We dont know how we will do. To me each venue is the same. When you are playing in India, there can be pressure because we are expected to win, and when we go to New Zealand, there is pressure because of the conditions, he said. As a team, we are not thinking of the rankings. We believe that if we play well consistently over a period of time, the rankings will take care of themselves.         
	Dhonis counterpart Daniel Vettori had said that New Zealand were scared by the six-hitting ability of Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh, apart from the Indian captain himself. But Dhoni would not indulge in any pre-series gamesmanship.         
	What others say is not in our control. We are concerned about landing there and preparing well. It is not only about me or Sehwag. There are others in the team, who, if they start hitting, any ground would look small, he said.         
	Earlier in the day, Dhoni also spoke about how he remained calm and composed when things go wrong on the field. At times I do get frustrated, but it doesnt help, it doesnt contribute if I start abusing the player concerned.         
	These are international players and they know what they have to do. It is better to go back to the dressing room and tell him what wrong he has done.

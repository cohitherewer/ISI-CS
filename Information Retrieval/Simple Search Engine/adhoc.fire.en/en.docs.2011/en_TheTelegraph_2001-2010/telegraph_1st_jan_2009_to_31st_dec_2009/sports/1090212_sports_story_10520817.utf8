The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Milan mull 18-month contract
                                                   Milan mull 18-month contract
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	AC Milan are considering offering David Beckham an 18-month contract to help unlock the impasse with LA Galaxy.         
	Beckham is keen to turn his three-month loan deal in Italy into a permanent move. Sources have indicated that Milan are hopeful of completing the transfer but have said it may fall to Beckham to buy out his contract with LA Galaxy.         
	Beckhams camp insist there is no chance of him doing that and the two clubs will have to reach an agreement. Milan are hopeful that the offer of an 18-month deal may tempt Beckham to break with his American employer.         
	LA Galaxy are holding out for a fee in the region of 15 million, but Milan refuse to match their valuation for a player who will be 34 on his next birthday. Moreover, Beckham has a break-clause in his contract in November, when he will become a free agent. Milan believe that Beckhams dream of playing in the 2010 World Cup will only be achieved if he stays in Serie A.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal underdogs against Delhi
                                                   Bengal underdogs against Delhi
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: It may not be termed a clash of David versus Goliath, but when Bengal lock horns with Delhi in a quarter final match of the national one-dayers for the Vijay Hazare Trophy on Wednesday, Delhi will have a definite upper hand.         
	Though both Delhi and Bengal have qualified as the group leaders from their respective zones for the knockout stages, statistically the North Zone champions enjoy a healthier record.         
	Not only can Delhi boast of the second highest total, 364 for 6 against Haryana, of the tournament, the top two slots in the list of individual run scorers are also occupied by Delhi batsmen, Virat Kohli (527 runs) and captain Aakash Chopra (396). Kohli has also slammed four centuries, the maximum so far, in the tournament. Bengals Wriddhiman Saha lies way down at the 27th spot on the run-getters list.         
	Unbeaten in the group stages, Bengal would be confident of a good show. The pitch however, according to reports received here, is a cause for concern.         
	The team management is worried that they may have to do with an under-prepared pitch in the crucial clash. The team had a three-hour long practice session on Tuesday.         
	The playing eleven though was yet to be decided, and according to a team official, the final call will only be taken on Wednesday morning after a look at the pitch.         
	Bengal, runners-up in the last edition, will bank on Manoj Tiwary, captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Saha with the bat while Ranadeb Bose and Ashok Dinda should be Bengals best bets in the bowling department.         
	Its worth mentioning that it is the part-timers  Shukla, Tiwary and Avik Chowdhury  have been more effective with the ball in the group stages. They will a play an important role in containing the prolific Delhi batsmen. Delhi defeated Railways in the pre-quarters, chasing down a massive target of 306.         
	In the other quarter final clash Wednesday, Mumbai face Tamil Nadu.

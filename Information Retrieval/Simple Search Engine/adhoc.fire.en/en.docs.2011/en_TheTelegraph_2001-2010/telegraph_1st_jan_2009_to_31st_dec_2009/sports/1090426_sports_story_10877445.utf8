The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pole for Trulli
                                                   Pole for Trulli
                      
	Manama: Italian Jarno Trulli seized pole position for the Bahrain Grand Prix on Saturday with Toyota teammate Timo Glock qualifying in second place for the teams first front row sweep.         
	Red Bulls young German Sebastian Vettel, winner in the wet in China last weekend, will start Sundays race in third place with championship leader Jenson Button alongside in his Mercedes-powered Brawn GP.         
	The pole was the fourth of Trullis Formula One career and first since Indianapolis in 2005.         
	The biggest disappointment of the afternoon was suffered by Red Bulls Mark Webber, with the Australian unable to get through the first session after being blocked by Force Indias Adrian Sutil.         
	Sutil was demoted three places to the back row and will start a place behind Webber.         
	McLarens Lewis Hamilton qualified a strong fifth.         
	The Briton will also have the advantage of the new KERS energy recovery system that gives an extra boost of power at the push of a button. None of the cars ahead of him are equipped with it.           (REUTERS)

	Johannesburg: Australia batted to a dominant position with a first-innings total of 466 in the first Test against South Africa on Friday, and then took two South African wickets in four balls to drive home the advantage.         
	South Africa recovered some composure by reaching 85 for three at stumps on the second day, but on two for two and with captain Graeme Smith out for a duck, the Proteas had been in dire straits at the start of their innings.         
	In the first over, Mitchell Johnson had Smith caught behind when he found the outside edge of the skippers bat. Three balls later, Hashim Amla was caught in the slips by Australia captain Ricky Ponting off debutant Ben Hilfenhaus second ball of the match.         
	Veteran South Africa batsman Jacques Kallis then became the eighth player to reach 10,000 Test runs when he got to 12, but he edged one to Michael Hussey in the gully on 27.         
	South Africa face an uphill battle to get back into the match and will need to be as patient as Australia were after the initial hiccups when they batted.         
	Earlier, debutant Marcus North hit a powerful 117 to help guide Australia to an imposing 466 at tea. Australia, seeking to rebound from a 1-2 series defeat against the Proteas at home, showed admirable composure after slipping to 38 for three on the first day.         
	North and no. 9 batsman Johnson, who thrashed 96 not out off 131 balls including 10 fours and five sixes, added 117 for the eighth wicket. The stand demoralised the hosts.

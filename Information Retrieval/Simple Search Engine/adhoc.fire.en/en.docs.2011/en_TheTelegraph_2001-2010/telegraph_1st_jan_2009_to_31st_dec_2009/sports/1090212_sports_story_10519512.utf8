The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Freddie on cruise after loss
                                                   Freddie on cruise after loss
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Andrew Flintoff and Steve Harmison went on a party cruise just hours after England suffered a humiliating innings-and-23-run defeat at the hands of the West Indies during the first Test at Sabina Park.         
	According to the Sun, Flintoff and Harmison, good friends on and off the pitch, boarded the six star Silver Shadow and stayed the night on the superliner, along with former internationals David Gower, Allan Lamb and Darren Gough.         
	The pair reportedly stayed in one of the ships best cabins and were flown back to Kingston by helicopter the next day.         
	A spokesman for the players said: They were having time off after the game and did not drink over dinner on the boat. They had a couple of drinks before retiring.         
	However, England supporters are reportedly less than happy that two of the teams key players, and most obvious flops during the opening Test, should be out partying after the team were bowled out for just 51.

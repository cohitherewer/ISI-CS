                                                     Yuvi: Indispensable too strong a word, I give the team balance
    - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 
  -  Vice-captain confident of being fit for entire Australia series             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Yuvraj Singh walks the ramp in Mumbai on Friday. (PTI)                                 
	Calcutta: Yuvraj Singh, who missed the recent Champions Trophy owing to his right little finger being fractured in a training session (in Johannesburg), spoke to The Telegraph from Mumbai on Saturday afternoon.         
	The 27-year-old Yuvraj, Team India vice-captain (in limited overs cricket) at the time of his injury, is in his tenth year of international cricket.               
	The following are excerpts               
	State of fitness         
	Complete mobility has returned to the right hand, which is pleasing... Today, Id say Im 80 per cent fine... Indeed, Im so much better than before and feeling pretty good with this progress.         
	His rather quick recovery         
	Thanks to Dr Jatin Chaudhary, who is based in New Delhi... Dr Chaudhary had helped fix my (left) knee, too, after Id got injured during the 2006 Champions Trophy... I went to him for three days, from October 3, and his treatment has worked once again.         
	Next step         
	Ill be going to the NCA (in Bangalore) on Tuesday, where Ill be assessed by physio Paul Close. Lets see what he says.         
	Own thoughts         
	Im confident of being fit for the entire seven-match (ODI) series against Australia, starting on October 25. However, the Board will go by what Close says in his report... Im confident, yes, but then lets see how things go in Bangalore.         
	Life immediately after getting injured on September 23         
	Tough... The first few days were really bad... Injuries are part of a sportspersons career, but it can get very tough.         
	Having watched the India-Pakistan Champions Trophy match from the dressing room in Centurion         
	If theres one match you just dont want to miss, then its the one against Pakistan... Sitting in the dressing room is bad enough, but it got worse as we began heading towards that big (54-run) defeat... Actually, I felt terrible, but was helpless.         
	India failing to make even the semi-final         
	Losing to Pakistan pushed us back... I think we were unlucky that the Australia match got abandoned...         
	Whether hed expected Australia to retain the Champions Trophy         
	Once the closing stages were reached, yes.         
	The growing belief that, in limited overs cricket, hes indispensable         
	(Laughs) Look, indispensable is too strong a word... I dont see it that way... Id say I give the team balance, both with my batting and bowling... I suppose Ive come to play an important role.         
	On the indispensable bit         
	From the time Ive returned from South Africa, everybody has been telling me that the result wouldve been different had I not got injured... While appreciating their feelings, I must emphasise that individuals can and do contribute, but 11 players complete a team and cricket is a team sport. My well-wishers should understand that.         
	Past few weeks         
	Mentally, Ive become tougher... Now, Im trying to get stronger physically.         
	Thoughts on the upcoming ODI series         
	The Australians, too, have injuries... That way, then, theres something common to both teams... However, the Australians have shown that their reserves bench is quite strong. A keenly-fought series is on the cards.         
	Buzz that New South Wales would like him on board for the domestic T20 competition in Australia         
	Nobody in an official capacity has approached me, but Id definitely love to play in Australia... Obviously, everything would depend on when and where Im required for India... Clearly, the country comes first.         
	Finally, on having walked the ramp for Manish Malhotra on Friday night         
	It was different from the usual things I do, it was fun.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Guwahati: Pune FC handed a shock 2-1 defeat to last years runners-up Dempo in a Group D match of the 31st Federation Cup at the Nehru Stadium Tuesday.         
	Both sides showed impressive skills and grit in a battle of nerves and Pune FC had to come back from a goal down to cause the first upset of the meet.         
	The opening half saw both sides trying to take the game to the opposition but the opening goal proved elusive and that is how it stayed in the barren first session.         
	It was Dempo striker Clifford Miranda broke the stalemate in the 75th minute after receiving a cross from Valeriano Rebello.         
	However, the advantage proved shortlived as Izumi Arata found the equaliser for Pune just three minutes later  a solo effort culminating in a spectacular strike from outside the 30-yard box.         
	Edmar Figueira scored the winning goal, cashing in on a defensive lapse by Anwar and custodian Abhijit Mondal.

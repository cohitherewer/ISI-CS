	Durban: Ravi Bopara (84) led the Kings XI Punjab to their first victory in the second edition of the Indian Premier League as they defeated the Royal Challengers Bangalore by a handsome seven-wicket margin here on Friday.         
	The England batsman batted with patience initially but stepped on the gas after reaching his half-century.         
	Bopara shared two crucial partnerships  52 for the first wicket with Karan Goel and 66 for the third wicket with Yuvraj Singh  to give the Punjab side a lease of life in the tournament.         
	Chasing 169 to win, the Punjab team overhauled the target with one over to spare with Yuvraj finishing it off with a six off Jacques Kallis.         
	Earlier, Kallis rescued the Bangalore side with a splendid 62 to help them overcome a mini top-order collapse and post a competitive 168 for nine after they were sent in to bat.         
	Yusuf Abdulla was the star performer for the Kings XI with his four-wicket haul while Irfan Pathan bagged three for 35.         
	Bopara initially relied on singles and it was only after the 15th over that he opened his arms and that too with great effect.         
	Bopara, who was adjudged the Man of the Match, hit four fours and five sixes in his 59-ball knock.         
	When Bopara departed, Punjab needed just 11 runs off 11 balls and Yuvraj (30 not out) finished the game for his side in style.         
	The Kings XI chase began on a cautious note as the openers, Goel (19) and Bopara, didnt go for the big shots too often as the ball came slow off the track.         
	The first six came only in the first ball of the seventh over when Bopara lofted Kallis over the mid-wicket, which also brought up the fifty-run partnership.         
	However, the pair frittered away the good start when Goel, who was dropped by Virat Kohli in the previous over, ran himself out.         
	 The Punjab side could have been 59 for two had Rahul Dravid not dropped Kumar Sangakkara (26) off Kevin Pietersen.         
	The Sri Lankan left-hander hit Pietersen for a four and six in the last over before the strategic break but failed to cash in on the life he got as he perished while trying to hit one from Anil Kumble out of the park.

	Linares: World champion Viswanathan Anand played out a hard- fought draw with Grandmaster Lenier Dominguez of Cuba in the third round of the 22nd Ciudad de Leon tournament here on Sunday.         
	Taking his tally to 1.5 points out of a possible three, the Indian ace remained in the joint third spot in the eight-player double round-robin tournament. The standings remained the same as the other games of the third round were also hard fought draws.         
	GM Levon Aronian of Armenia and Alexander Grischuk of Russia remained in joint lead with two points each after drawing with Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan and Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine, respectively.         
	Wang Yue played a solid game to hold Magnus Carlsen of Norway in the fourth game of the day.         
	Anand shares the third spot alongside Dominguez, Carlsen and Ivanchuk while Radjabov and Wang Yue are currently at the bottom of the table with one point each.         
	Playing the black side of a Sicilian Nazdorf, Anand faced the English attack from Dominguez but defended his citadel well.         
	The pieces got exchanged at regular intervals and the players arrived at a rook and minor piece endgame with the balance remaining intact.         
	Anand created his counter play on the king side and the position became exciting for a short period with both players having two passed pawns on different flank. (PTI)

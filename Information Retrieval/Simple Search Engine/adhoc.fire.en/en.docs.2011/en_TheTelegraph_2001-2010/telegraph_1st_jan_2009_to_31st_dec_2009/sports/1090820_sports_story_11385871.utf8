                                                   Gender test
                      
	The IAAF has asked the South African athletics federation to conduct a gender verification test on 800-metre runner Caster Semenya amid concerns she does not meet the requirements to compete as a woman.         
	The IAAF requested the gender test about three weeks ago, after the 18-year-old Semenya burst onto the scene by slicing her personal bests in the 800 and 1,500 by huge margins.

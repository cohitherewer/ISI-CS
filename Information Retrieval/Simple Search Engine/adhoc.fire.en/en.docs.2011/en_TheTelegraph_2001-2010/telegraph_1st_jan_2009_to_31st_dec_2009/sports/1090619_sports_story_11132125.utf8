The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Md. Sp. are peeved with IFA   Kalighat feat   Torch run   Hockey turf
                                                   In The City 
                      
	 Md. Sp. are peeved with IFA 
    Mohammedan Sporting lashed out at the Indian Football Federation (IFA) on Thursday for not sending the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) representatives to their club. The representatives, who were in the city to inspect infrastructure at the various city clubs, visited Mohun Bagan, East Bengal, George Telegraph, Bhowanipore and City Club but bypassed Mohammedan Sporting.         
	Meanwhile, the black and white brigade will sign 19 footballers for the coming season on Friday. Satyajit Bose and Jothi Kumar feature in the list. For the two foreigners slot, Theodore Sunday and Peter Odafe are on the clubs radar.                     
	 Kalighat feat 
    Kalighat made it three in a row as they lifted the CAB senior knock out championship at the Eden on Thursday beating Mohun Bagan by 79 runs in the final. Kalighat had earlier pocketed the CAB two-day league trophy and the AN Ghosh Trophy.         
	Batting first, Kalighat put up 274 for nine with contributions from Anustup Majumdar (75) and Sreevats Goswami (64). In reply, Bagan were bowled out for 195.         
	The Bagan camp was severely critical of a couple of umpiring decisions. Importantly, it was Prosenjit Banerjee against whom the charge was made. Banerjee is the same umpire who allegedly ruled certain appeals in favour of Kalighat in the AN Ghosh Trophy final versus East Bengal.         
	Meanwhile, in a P Sen Trophy match at the Jadavpur University, Salt Lake campus ground on Thursday, Town Club edged past BNR by two runs. Arindam Ghosh of BNR scored 120.         
	SUMMARISED SCORES         
	 CAB senior knock out final: Kalighat 274/9. Mohun Bagan 195. Kalighat won by 79 runs.         
	 P Sen Trophy: Town Club 269/9. BNR 267/8. Town Club won by 2 runs.

    The Bengal Olympic Association, in association with the Indian Olympic Association, will be organising an Olympic Day Run on Sunday. The torch run will be flagged off at 9am from the Bally Deshbandhu Club.                     
	 Hockey turf
    The state may get a new astroturf surface as the Bengal Olympic Association, in association with the Bengal Hockey Association, has plans to lay the turf at the Dumurjala Sports Complex in Howrah.

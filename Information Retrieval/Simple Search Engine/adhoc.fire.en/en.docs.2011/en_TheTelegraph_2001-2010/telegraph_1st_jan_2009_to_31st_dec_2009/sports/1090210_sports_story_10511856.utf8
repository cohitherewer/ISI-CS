The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arshavin wrong choice for Arsenal
                                                   Arshavin wrong choice for Arsenal
            Alan Hansen                                  
	Even though Arsenal were so resilient defensively on Sunday, their challenge is where they go from here. After seven draws in their last 11 games it is not a question now of them not winning the Premier League, it is a question of them not finishing in the top four. How the mighty have fallen.         
	Arsenals problem is never when they have the ball, because in possession they are still as good as anybody we have seen. But it is when they have not got the ball that they have a problem, when they are desperate for a player to win back possession for them in the middle of the park.         
	This is why I am surprised Arsenal pursued Andrei Arshavin so enthusiastically, because the striker is similar to what they already have. Their money could have been better spent elsewhere. They are crying out for player in a different position, of a different mould  whether this be a centre-back or holding midfield player, or simply somebody who can put his foot in and be competitive for 90 minutes non-stop.         
	Wilson Palacios, as we saw on Sunday, has the potential to be this kind of player for Tottenham and Arsene Wenger should have bought a player of his type. Although as many of his passes went astray against Arsenal as went to a white shirt, Harry Redknapp bought him for a certain commodity: to work really hard, to challenge and to tussle.         
	He is a not got the ball type of player, whereas Arshavin is not. We saw in the last European Championships that Arshavin was a multi-talented player but if Arsenal are going to compete for the championship then you need something extra. Wenger has gone away from the ingredients he had in his team four or five years ago, when there was the talent and the ability in his team but also the power and the height. Pace, power and aerial threat still represent a huge part of the game in the Premier League.         
	Possession is king for Arsenal, but while possession will make the opposition tired it is not everything. It has been argued that they are playing this way because of the fluency in which the Spanish played in Euro 2008, but the Premier League is an entirely different proposition from European competition at the highest level. The teams who win the league year after year are those with variation, who can play it long and short, fast and slow.         
	Manchester United do not play brilliantly every game because they cannot, it is an impossibility. Arsenals win against United last September was as good as any team have performed all season, but you cannot play like that every week.         
	So you need something extra and it comes from every area of the pitch, whether in goalscoring, scrapping or ball-winning. Unfortunately Arsenal do not have this something extra  certainly not going forward, although what they have done is to eradicate some of the defensive problems they have had, especially from set plays.         
	Arsenal have the problem that when they are not playing so well, they cannot seem to pick up three points, and this has been the case for the last couple of seasons. So they need a combination of where they can win both when they are playing well and when they are not. Finishing fourth or fifth is not determined by how much possession you have but by how many points. Chelsea have become a mini-Arsenal, in one sense, because they can play 95 passes but the ball often ends up going back to the same position.         
	Wenger has done a remarkable job at Arsenal but theres only one certainty Im aware of in football: that when you are not winning trophies and the supporters are used to winning them, then they are not going to be happy whatever type of football you play. What you want first is to win, and then to win with style.

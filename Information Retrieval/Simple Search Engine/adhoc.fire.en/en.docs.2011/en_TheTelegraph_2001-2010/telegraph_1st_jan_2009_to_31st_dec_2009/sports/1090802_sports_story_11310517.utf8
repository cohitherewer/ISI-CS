The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhullar is tied at third spot
                                                   Bhullar is tied at third spot
                      
	Bandar Seri Begawan (Brunei): Gaganjeet Bhullar put himself in contention for a second successive Asian Tour title after returning a blemish-free seven-under 64 in the penultimate round to take a share of the third spot at the Brunei Open here on Saturday.         
	Bhullar made the biggest move of the day by storming up the leaderboard to the tied third place after starting at tied-21st. He is tied with Australias Scott Barr and Koreas Ted Oh on matching 11-under 202s.         
	With the possibility of becoming the first player on the Asian Tour to win back-to-back victories this season, the Indian talent is now banking on the mental strength that he has acquired over the years to win his second title in two weeks.         
	The thing is to keep everything simple and one thing that has worked for me is to keep my mind relaxed, said the 21-year-old.         
	I think Ive become a better player after playing the Open in Turnberry. My mental vision towards my goal has definitely changed a lot. Playing on the Asian Tour has also helped me a lot as it taught me how to keep myself in contention week after week, he added.         
	Meanwhile, compatriot C Muniyappa set a new course record after firing a sparkling 62 that left him tied sixth just a stroke behind Bhullar overall.         
	The 32-year-old from Bangalore notched his best score of the week after rounds of 69 and 72.         
	Among other Indians, Chiragh Kumar was tied 26th after carding 68 that left his total at five-under 208. Anirban Lahiri (70) rose a rung to tied 35th with a total of three-under 210.         
	Further down, veteran Gaurav Ghei shared the 53rd spot after carding a 72. Ghei has a total of even-par 213.

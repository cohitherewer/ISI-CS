The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahesh, Mark fall; Novak ousts Rafa
                                                     Mahesh, Mark fall; Novak ousts Rafa
                  Novak Djokovic                     
	Cincinnati: Rafa Nadals semi-final exit at the Cincinnati Masters on Saturday had exceeded his own expectations, the former World No. 1 said.         
	The Spaniard was outplayed 6-1, 6-4 by fourth seed Novak Djokovic in the last four, admitting that beating the Serb was a step too far at this stage of his return. He was appearing in just his second tournament after two months out due to injury.         
	Djokovic will now play Roger Federer in the final as the current World. No. 1 got the better of Andy Murray 6-2, 7-6.         
	Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles six-match winning streak ended with their semi-final loss at the hands of Wimbledon champions Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjic.         
	The fourth-seed Indo-Bahamian pair lost 4-6, 3-6 to the second seeded Canadian-Serbian combination in a little over an hour.         
	Bhupathi and Knowles got 360 ranking points each and split the $33,825 prize money.         
	The Indo-Bahamian pair, the winners of last weeks Montreal Masters, dropped their serve once but failed to grab the only chance they got in the first set to break their opponents. In the second set, they broke their opponents service once but dropped their own thrice, which ruled out a comeback.         
	With this win, Nestor and Zimonjic avenged last weeks semi-final loss to Bhupathi and Knowles. In the final, they will face defending champions Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan.         
	Nadal said reaching the quarter finals in Montreal last week and the last four in Cincinnati had been even better than he hoped for going into the US Open that starts on August 31.         
	This week is very important for me, he told reporters. (Agencies)

            A STAFF REPORTER            Devang Gandhi                           
	Calcutta: Former Bengal cricketers Devang Gandhi and Gopal Bose, who are already involved with the training of children at three camps sponsored by Ultra Plus  in the city, Siliguri and Durgapur  would be associated, from October 1, with two new projects with the same sponsor, Naktala Cricket Coaching Centre (NCCC) and Cricket Club of Dhakuria (CCD).         
	The NCCC and CCD have been brought under Ultra Plus umbrella as we are trying to spread our wings, said Devang.         
	Gopalda and myself have decided to implement an uniform coaching method in these academies, he added.

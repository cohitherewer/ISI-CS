	New Delhi: Virender Sehwags allegations of nepotism and corruption in the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA), on Tuesday, triggered a virtual revolt against the administration with more senior players like Gautam Gambhir and Ishant Sharma threatening to quit the Delhi Ranji team.         
	Even as rattled DDCA officials sought to play down the brewing unrest among the players, Sehwag claimed that more players would support him on the issue.         
	More will come out, said Sehwag, who is currently in Bangalore undergoing rehabilitation for his injured shoulder.         
	The DDCA sports secretary Sunil Dev has refuted the allegations and said that he was prepared to talk to the players and resolve the differences.         
	Apart from Gambhir and Sharma, Ashish Nehra was another senior player who supported Sehwags campaign.         
	A concerned DDCA president Arun Jaitley has told his officials not to precipitate the crisis and let things cool down.         
	Sehwag is likely meet Jaitley on August 27 or 28.         
	Gambhir felt the DDCA sports committee needed to be changed as it put pressure on captains and stand-in captains to play their candidates. Ishant voiced his support for Sehwag as he said: He is absolutely right about selection matters.         
	The DDCA vice-president and chairman of the selection committee Chetan Chauhan conceded that there were certain problems of nepotism, which needed to be addressed.         
	Sehwag also got support from Madan Lal, who was critical of the functioning of the sports committee.         
	Meanwhile, the BCCI sought to distance itself from the developments, saying it was an internal matter between the players and their association.           (PTI)

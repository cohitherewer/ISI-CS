The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nasser Hussain too blames it on IPL 
                                                   Nasser Hussain too blames it on IPL 
                            
	London: The Indian Premier League continues to be blamed for Englands cricketing slump with ex-captain Nasser Hussain saying that IPL issues have prevented Andrew Strauss men from playing as a happy bunch.         
	They have not been a happy bunch  there have been issues about the IPL, Hussain was quoted as saying by a newspaper.         
	England went down by an innings and 23 runs against the West Indies in the first Test in Jamaica, being bowled out for an embarrassing 51 runs in their second innings.         
	The defeat came a day after star batsman Kevin Pietersen and allrounder Andrew Flintoff became the worlds richest cricketers attracting record-breaking bids of $ 1.55 million each in the IPL players auction.         
	Hussain said apart from the IPL, Pietersens equation with a few teammates after being asked to step down as England captain, due to his public spat with sacked coach Peter Moores, is also a cause of concern.         
	Ive felt since I arrived there are still issues between Pietersen and certain people, both in and out of the side, he said.         
	It seems this England side have to be kicked before they can show what they can do, he added.         
	Another former skipper Graham Gooch also blamed the IPL for distracting the players during the Test.         
	The England team says there has been no distraction with the IPL. But when all these background influences are going on, its not the best environment to give your best performances, he said.         
	Reflecting on the loss, Ian Botham said Englands cricketers have not bettered their skills as much as other international players have and the team relies too heavily on Pietersens form.         
	At the same time Englands batsmen must face up to their failure. For me there has been too much of a reliance on the top order for Kevin Pietersen to get the runs all the time  it is not good enough.         
	All of Englands so-called young talent need to work harder on getting better. My old pal Nasser Hussain comes up with a bright thought every now and again and I completely agree with his sentiment that Englands cricketers are standing still while the rest of the world are moving forward.

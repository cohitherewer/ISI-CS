                                                   Lehmann bats for Symonds
                      
	Melbourne: Deccan Chargers coach Darren Lehmann feels Australia should include Andrew Symonds in their squad for Ashes 2009.         
	Impressed with the all-rounders performance in the ongoing Indian Premier League, Lehmann has come out in support of Symonds. Hes in good nick, hes enjoying cricket and enjoying being with us, and Im sure hed enjoy being back with Australia as well. Ive been very impressed with him, Lehmann said.         
	He knows the bowlers well, hes played against England many a time, and hes in form, and if they pick him, itd be great for him. The Australian side, too, is still a better side with him in it, he added. (PTI)

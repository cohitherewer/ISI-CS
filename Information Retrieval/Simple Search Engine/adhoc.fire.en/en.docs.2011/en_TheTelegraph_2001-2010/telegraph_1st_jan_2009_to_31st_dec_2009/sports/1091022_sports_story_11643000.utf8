The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nielsen praises Paine
                                                   Nielsen praises Paine
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Australia coach Tim Nielsen Wednesday heaped praises on wicketkeeper-batsman Tim Paine who has been impressive since his debut against Scotland earlier this year.         
	Paine, so far, has 389 runs from 13 ODIs and a century and two half-centuries.         
	Nielsen said Paine would give his team the much-needed flexibility in the top order.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On Australias chances         
	Weve had success in India before and are playing our best cricket now. We have always been excited about coming here... We have come a long way since our loss to South Africa last year and hope this series will be another stepping stone, especially for the younger players.         
	On Tim Paine         
	Hes a great talent and gives us flexibility... We have an option with both Tim (Paine) and Shane (Watson) capable of opening the batting. We will think more about it as we get closer to the first game.

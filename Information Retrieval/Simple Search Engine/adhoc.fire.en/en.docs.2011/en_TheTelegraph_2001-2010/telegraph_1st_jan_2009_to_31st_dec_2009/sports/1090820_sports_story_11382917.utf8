The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Venus upset
                                                   Venus upset
                      
	Toronto: Third seed Venus Williamss return to Canada ended in a shock 6-1, 5-7, 4-6 second round defeat to Ukrainian qualifier Kateryna Bondarenko at the Rogers Cup on Tuesday.         
	Kim Clijsters return, however, had a much happier ending as the hugely popular 2005 champion continued her comeback from a two-year absence with a business-like 6-3, 6-4 first round victory over British qualifier Elena Baltacha.         
	Williams has won 41 career titles but never won a match at the Canadian event that alternates between Toronto and Montreal.         
	In other first-round action, ninth seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus eased past Chinas Peng Shuai 6-3, 6-3 while 11th-seeded Serb Ana Ivanovic needed three sets to beat Slovakian qualifier Magdalena Rybarikova 2-6, 6-3, 6-2.         
	Italian 12th seed Flavia Pennetta advanced with a routine 6-3, 6-3 win over Russian Maria Kirilenko.

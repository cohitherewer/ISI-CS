The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United come calling 
                                                   United come calling 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Manchester United are finally here in India joining hands with the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to promote the game at the grassroots level.         
	On Wednesday, three top officials from the Premier League club visited the AIFF headquarters, Football House, in the capital and held preliminary discussions on how the English club could be associated with Indian football.         
	The high profile delegation included Brian McClair, the director of the Manchester United academy, Steve Jones, the business head of the school and Bell Hopps, a consultant.         
	McClair is a former Scottish international whose playing career for United lasted 11 years. In 468 appearances for the club, he found the net 126 times. The AIFF was represented by general secretary, Alberto Colaco, national coach Bob Houghton and other federation officials.         
	Jones, however, later said: We are in a middle of a discussion at the moment. We are still talking and working out all available options. There is no particular commitment yet.         
	We have not finished yet, Jones said. This is an exciting time for Indian football. Whatever be the outcome, the players will be benefited.         
	According to sources, the English club are here to weigh the pros and cons of lending technical support to the AIFF soccer academy at Cuncolim in Goa. The ambitious 100-crore project would be sponsored and financed by cellular service majors Bharati, who entered into an agreement with the federation last year.         
	A representative from Bharati was also present during the discussion.         
	In the meeting held in the afternoon, the AIFF general secretary made a detailed presentation on the federations activities and pointed out that India were looking forward to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.         
	Houghton on his part said that India has enough talent and resources to become a soccer power in the near future. The Manchester United officials were also informed about Indias recent youth development programme and the training centre in Goa.         
	The officials of the English club said they would make their presentation on Thursday. It was not immediately known what they actually have in mind about supporting Indias cause, but the AIFF would certainly like the visitors to help in planning the state of the art academy in Goa.         
	The academy, which was supposed to come up last March, ran into trouble after a section of the local people in Cuncolim protested against the project. The problem was solved after intervention from the AIFF acting-president Praful Patel, who is also the union civil aviation minister.

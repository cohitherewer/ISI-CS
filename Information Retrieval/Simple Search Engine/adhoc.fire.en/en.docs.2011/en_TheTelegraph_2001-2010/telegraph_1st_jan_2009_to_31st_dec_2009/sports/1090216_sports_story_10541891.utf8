	St Johns: England made a confident start in the third test against West Indies on Sunday, reaching 58 without loss at lunch on the first day at the Antigua Recreation Ground.               
	At 12 am, England were 137 for the loss of one wicket. The West Indies captain Chris Gayle dismissed England opener Alastair Cook (52). Andrew Strauss (71) and Owais Shah (10) were at the crease.               
	The game had been hastily arranged following the abandonment of the second test on Friday after just ten balls when the field at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium was deemed unfit.         
	The start was delayed by 45 minutes due to overnight rain. West Indies captain Chris Gayle won the toss, decided to field first and play began exactly 48 hours after it had finished on Friday.         
	England captain Andrew Strauss looked in particularly good form as he hit seven fours to reach 34 not out by the interval with Alastair Cook on 24. England made two changes to the side selected for the abandoned second test on Friday.         
	Off-spinner Graeme Swann came in for Monty Panesar and seamer Steve Harmison replaced Ryan Sidebottom.         
	West Indies made no changes from the side that took the field for just 10 balls on Friday at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium.           (REUTERS)

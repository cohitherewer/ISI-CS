                                                   Atanu fifth in qualifying
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Atanu Das of Bengal, now with the Tata Archery Academy, stood fifth overall in the individual qualification with a total of 1294 points at the 11th Youth World Archery Championship 2009 at Ogden, Utah (US) on Monday.         
	Amid dominating displays by Korea, in the recurve, and hosts United States in the compound, only the Indian junior recurve team brought cheer to the Indian camp, according to information received here Tuesday.         
	A total of 3822 points earned the India mens junior recurve team a creditable second place in the team qualifications behind Korea (4018) in what was the only silver lining in an otherwise dull day for India. Atanu placed fifth after each archer shot 36 arrows over four distances  90, 70, 50 and 50 metres  for a total of 144 arrows.

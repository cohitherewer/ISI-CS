The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AIFF divided over United
                                                   AIFF divided over United
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) seems divided over the issue of joining hands with Manchester United to set up the Rs 100 crore academy in Goa.         
	According to sources, a number of federation functionaries, including national coach Bob Houghton are against the idea of involving the English club in the project, to be funded by telecom major, Bharti.         
	While Houghton and a few others want to keep Manchester United out of the proposed academy, some other officials see no harm in getting help from the English club, sources said.         
	The issue was extensively discussed in the recent executive committee meeting of the AIFF, which was attended by a representative of the sponsor.         
	While Houghton made no secret of his desire to go ahead without United, the official from the sponsor said his company was convinced that the English club would be of great help in the project.         
	So sharp was the divide in the meeting that at one point, the sponsors representative said nobody should feel his company was carried away by the fame of United.         
	The official even claimed that his employers were in touch with several top European clubs and found Uniteds offer to be the best.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Our destiny is in our own hands: Ricky
                                                     Our destiny is in our own hands: Ricky
                  Ricky Ponting has been in good form                     
	Australia captain Ricky Ponting is expecting a tough encounter on Wednesday despite talks of Pakistan putting up a second string side. He made it clear during a press conference on Tuesday that they were not taking things for granted.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Looking back at Mondays match against India         
	We were disappointed with the way things finished off yesterday (Monday). I thought we were in a pretty strong position. Pretty few wickets down and going into the last 10 overs with 240-odd on the board, youd post a total around 300 which I thought would be really competitive on that pitch. Were disappointed that it didnt finish. The positive for us was to spend that much time in the middle against some good spin bowling .         
	Indias bowling         
	I thought they bowled okay. It was a good wicket to bowl on early when we started. We were surprised by how slow it was but it probably got better as the day got on. We did a good job to combat their bowling early on  the way Paine played thats a positive for us. They bowled steady.         
	Australia regaining the No. 1 spot         
	We havent really thought much about the rankings coming in. All we could do in England was try and get as prepared for this tournament. The ODI cricket we played over there was excellent and when youve seen what England have done here, its pretty impressive. We had one eye on this tournament all the time. We want to be the No. 1 for sure, thats the reason we train and try to become the best player. South Africa being out and India I am really happy with where we are with our cricket at the moment.         
	Ishant Sharmas form has been a worry and if India need to adopt the rotation policy         
	Thats one of the big jobs you have as a coach and fitness advisor Youve to try and mange each player as best you can. Its something weve tried to embrace over the last few years. I had a break in not going to Dubai and missed the first three games in England this year to keep physically and mentally fresh for this tournament. The juggling and rotation of player workload is a big issue. Im not sure if that is the problem with Ishant in this tournament I dont know whats going on there at the moment but I know therere a few people who think hes a little bit off the boil at the moment. Most of the time that is just a confidence thing with the players and Im sure its the same for fast bowlers. When your confidence is down it makes the game very difficult and thats probably where Ishant is at the moment.         
	Thoughts on Wednesdays game         
	We will obviously be trying to win the game. Weve been playing some good cricket recently so were confident that we can match up well against Pakistan. We know what we have to do to progress. Destiny is in our own hands, well continue to play well and improve. Its been pleasing in the last few weeks that we have improved and played better. We all know how dangerous Pakistan can be and especially of late theyve been playing some very good cricket. If they happen to leave some of the big boys out, itll make our job a little easier, but whatever team they put out itll be a tough game.         
	On Australias chances of making the semis         
	Itll be disappointing if we dont make it tomorrow (Wednesday). Were in a pretty good position to make it through but its all about how you play on the day. Youve just got to look at South Africa, red hot favourites who didnt perform at their best for two games and are out.

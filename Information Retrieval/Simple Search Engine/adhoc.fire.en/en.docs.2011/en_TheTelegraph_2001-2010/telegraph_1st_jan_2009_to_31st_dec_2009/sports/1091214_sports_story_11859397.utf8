                                                                                                                       7                                      Chance for India to narrow the gap with the Aussies 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Fresh after claiming the No. 1 Test spot, India can narrow the gap with ODI table-toppers Australia if they win the one-day series against Sri Lanka, but they also risk going down the list if they lose the five-match series starting in Rajkot on Tuesday.         
	In the individual rankings, Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has to perform very well to defend the No. 1 spot in batting while Yuvraj Singh can return to the top-three. Virender Sehwag can regain a top-10 spot with some stellar performances in this series, according to a release.         
	India are currently second with 122 ratings points, eight behind Australia, but can reduce the gap to four points if they manage to win all five matches of the series.         
	On the other hand, India can also only drop a position if they lose the series 1-4 or worse.         
	If India lose the series 1-4, they will drop to 117 ratings points, two behind South Africa, while a 0-5 defeat will put it on a par with Kumar Sangakkaras side on 115 ratings point but behind Sri Lanka when the ratings are calculated beyond the decimal point.

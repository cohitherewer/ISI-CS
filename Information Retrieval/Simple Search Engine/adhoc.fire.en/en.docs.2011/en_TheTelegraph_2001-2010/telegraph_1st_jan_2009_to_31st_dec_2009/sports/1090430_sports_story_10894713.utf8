The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | T20 not just a young mans game: Sachin
                                                     T20 not just a young mans game: Sachin
                  Sachin Tendulkar                     
	Durban: Indian batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar insisted that age has got nothing to do with a players performance in Twenty20 and that those who consider it as a young mans game, have little knowledge about cricket.         
	I dont know who says that its a young mans game. Clearly, he doesnt know much about cricket.         
	Its a cricketers game so it really doesnt matter whether you are young or old. It is a cricketers match, Tendulkar said on the Indian Premier Leagues official website.         
	The 36-year-old skipper of the Mumbai Indians, who has been in sparkling form in the ongoing second edition IPL, have scored 163 runs at an average of over 80 in three matches. He is currently fourth on the leading scorers list.         
	Tendulkar said opening the Mumbai innings with Sanath Jayasuriya has been a fantastic experience so far.         
	... even last year I enjoyed batting at the other end and it was fantastic. He has got excellent hand-eye co-ordination, very quick feet, very quick hands. Needless to say that he is one of the best strikers in the world, said Tendulkar.         
	The right-hander said he is not chasing hundreds in the event and remains focussed on ensuring wins for his team.         
	I am not playing for 100s, I am playing for the team. And if I score a hundred even better for the team. The idea is not to chase a 100. If it comes my way its fine. As long as my contribution is there for the team, that is what matters. If it has helped us to get to a good total, I am a happy person, he said.

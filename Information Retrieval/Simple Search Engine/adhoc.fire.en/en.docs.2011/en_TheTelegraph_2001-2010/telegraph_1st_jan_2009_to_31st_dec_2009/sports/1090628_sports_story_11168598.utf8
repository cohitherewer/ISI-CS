            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The West Indies team has been fined for slow over-rate during their 20-run defeat against India in the first ODI of the four-match series in Kingston on Friday.         
	Match Referee Chris Broad imposed the fines after Chris Gayles side was ruled to be two overs short of its target at the end of India innings when time allowances were taken into consideration, according to an ICC statement Saturday.         
	Gayle was fined 20 per cent of his match fee while his players received 10 per cent fines.         
	The second match of the four-match ODI series will be played in Kingston on Sunday.         
	India won the first one-dayer by 20 runs, riding Yuvraj Singhs explosive 131 off 102 balls.

                                                   EB game if Bhutia gets release
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal are ready to welcome Bhaichung Bhutia back, but not before the India captain gets the release order from Mohun Bagan. Club secretary Kalyan Majumder made it clear on Tuesday that Bhaichung can only return to the red-and-gold brigade after getting the release order.         
	We cannot sign a player who is yet to be released. Its just not on... Then there is the budget factor. We have to weigh the pros and cons before we take the plunge, he said after the executive committee meeting at the club tent on Tuesday.         
	When asked whether it would make good business sense for the club to sign Bhaichung since the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has planned camps for the national team, Majumder said his club had already made their stand clear.         
	Bhaichung would have to abide by the club stand vis--vis the national camp. As we said before, we will release players only for AFC and Fifa-organised tournaments. Rules cannot be different for different players, he said.         
	East Bengals insistence on the release order probably stems from the fact that last year they could not sign Steven Dias and N.P. Pradeep. The Mahindra United duo were eager to play for East Bengal but the Mumbai club refused to give the release order citing contractual obligations. We dont want to repeat that mistake, a source said.         
	East Bengal official Manas Mukherjee said money wont be a problem in their effort to rope in Bhaichung. The amount we earmarked for Sunil Chetri (who was released by the club) can be easily utilised. But then coach Subhas Bhowmick will have to take the final call. He is building the team for the next season.         
	Sources in East Bengal said Bhaichung is believed to have told the club that he was optimistic about getting the release order from Bagan. However, Bhaichung had yet to reply to the showcause notice on Tuesday. Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra said his club were adopting a wait-and-watch policy. We wont act in haste, Mitra said at the Howrah Stadium.         
	Its not only East Bengal who are game for Bhaichung. Chirag United too have joined the race to sign the star player. The club supremo Kaustav Roy is likely to have a talk with Bhaichung in Mumbai on Wednesday. The India skipper left for Mumbai late on Tuesday for the dance programme he is participating in.         
	Chetri, meanwhile, is leaving for Goa to talk to Dempo officials. There are some things to be sorted out before I sign on the dotted line, he said from New Delhi. And if Dempo doesnt materialise, I may take up the Bagan offer. They are showing keen interest in me, he said.

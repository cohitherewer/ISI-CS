The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 75 win was different, says Thapa
                                                   75 win was different, says Thapa
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Shyam Thapa feels that had he converted the penalty on that September afternoon against Mohun Bagan, things would have been different. I scored two goals in that famous 5-0 win but in hindsight I think the penalty miss made all the difference. Had I converted that the record would have been 6-0! the TFA technical director said on Tuesday.         
	The legend goes that East Bengal did not want to score from a penalty on that day and Thapa was advised not to score from the spot.         
	Thats not true. You tell me who would not want to score a goal. I think its just an anecdote the East Bengal fans use to taunt the Bagan supporters, he said.         
	Thapa refused to draw any parallels between the IFA Shield final and Sundays I-League match. During those days five goals in a match used to be very big. But now I think scoring five goals is normal. The 1975 win was different.         
	Today Bagan will score five, tomorrow some other team will score six against them, he said. Football is not the same anymore, he said.         
	However, for Bagan they have exorcised the ghost. It had been haunting them for the last 34 years. Now it will be their turn to taunt their rivals, he said laughing.         
	And even if East Bengal say that they have lost 3-5 and not 0-5 I dont agree with them. Bagan have scored five goals. Thats it.

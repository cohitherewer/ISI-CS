The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saina happy with her fitness after tough match 
                                                   Saina happy with her fitness after tough match 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hyderabad: Saina Nehwal was exhausted after scraping past the Bulgarian 10th seed Petya Nedelcheva 18-21, 21-18, 21-10 in the pre-quarter finals of the World Badminton Championships at the Gachibowli Stadium on Thursday. And she had every reason to be.         
	It was a very tough match, she admitted.         
	But then you have to see the positives. I did not get tired which was a good sign. I also continued with long rallies. That shows that I am back to my normal fitness level, she said.         
	It might be recalled that there were doubts over Sainas fitness after she recovered from a mild bout of chicken pox, just in time for the Championships.         
	Saina said Petya never managed to dictate terms. She took the first game as I made too many unforced errors.         
	The second was tough but I managed to get a good lead. My best game was the third, she said. Sainas record with Petya now stands at 2-1 in the Indians favour.         
	Saina once again thanked the crowd for the support. They were just great. Really helped me, especially in the last couple of points.         
	Its great that so many spectators are coming. I hope they come tomorrow (Friday) to cheer me.         
	Indeed Saina will be needing the crowd support as she will be up against the Chinese second seed Lin Wang.         
	Saina had defeated Lin Wang in the past but then Friday will be a different ball game altogether.         
	If Saina manages to get past her rival, she will possibly take on Danish third seed Tine Rasmussen, whom she has never defeated before.         
	Friday will be tough. I hope my rallies dont let me down against Petya Saina said.         
	About the air conditioning draught which had been drawing a lot of flak from the players, Saina said: We are professionals. We should be able to deal with it.

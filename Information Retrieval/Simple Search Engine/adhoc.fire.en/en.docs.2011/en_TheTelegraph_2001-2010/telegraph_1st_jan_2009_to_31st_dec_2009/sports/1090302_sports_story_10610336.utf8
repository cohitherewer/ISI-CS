The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jury is out on referral system
                                                   Jury is out on referral system
                      
	Bridgetown: The umpire video referral system, designed to reduce mistakes by allowing the use of technology, showed it remains subject to human error in Saturdays fourth Test between England and the West Indies.         
	West Indies felt hard done by after two lbw decisions, crucial in the context of the game, went against them when the television images indicated the ball was too high at the point of impact with the pad.         
	John Dyson, West Indies Australian coach, marched down to the match referee Alan Hurst following the arguable decisions against Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Brendan Nash.         
	I just went down the stairs to have a chat with Alan Hurst. We just wanted to clarify a few things, Dyson said.         
	I think were still getting to grips with the whole concept. When you play your whole life with the umpires being in sole charge, but now sometimes find yourself in situations where you can question the decisions, it is hard to deal with, he added.         
	Hurst said it had clearly been a difficult day for the officials, including third umpire Daryl Harper. (REUTERS)

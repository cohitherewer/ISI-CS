The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Becks clashes with fan again
                                                   Becks clashes with fan again
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	David Beckham has clashed with another fan just one week after an ugly confrontation with spectators during his first home match for the Los Angeles Galaxy after returning from Italy.         
	The latest incident saw the 34-year-old exchange words with a male in the crowd, who was wearing an England shirt, during the Galaxys 1-1 draw with the Kansas City Wizards at the weekend.         
	Beckham appeared to take offence at something the man said, and later claimed the spectator had insulted his wife, Victoria.

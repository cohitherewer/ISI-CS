                                                     Weather worry for Knights, Kings XI
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Yuvraj Singh                           
	Durban: With inclement weather holding centre stage for much of Monday afternoon, both the Kolkata Knight Riders and the Kings XI Punjab, which suffered defeats in their opening matches in IPL 2009, had reason to worry.         
	They are, after all, to play here on Tuesday (the days first match) and desperate to log their first points.         
	Right now, Im largely thinking of the weather... Ive been informed that theres a 60 per cent chance of rain in the morning, the Kings XI captain, Yuvraj Singh, told The Telegraph.         
	While his team lost to the Delhi DareDevils in a rain-shortened match, the Knight Riders were handed an eight-wicket defeat by the Deccan Chargers.         
	Both matches were in Cape Town.         
	Yuvraj, though, isnt reading too much into the losses. We were, to a large extent, done in by rain... As for the Knight Riders, I see them as dangerous... Any team with Chris Gayle and Brendon McCullum at the top would be just that...         
	Till late on Monday, the Knight Riders XI hadnt been finalised. Its to be seen whether Mashrafe Mortaza, whod been fiercely sought by the Kings XI during this years auction, is fielded by the Knight Riders.         
	The match, indeed, will be both a cricket and a Bollywood battle  Shah Rukh Khan versus Preity Zinta, off the field.         
	Match starts: 4 pm (IST).
      Going by a very late development, Ajit Agarkar would be dropped. The Knight Riders could play Anureet Singh or, if the batting is to be strengthened, then Yashpal Singh.

	 The CAB tournament committee on Thursday penalised Kalighat by deducting four points for fielding an outstation player, Sonu Sharma, in a CAB first division league match against YMCA in January. Sonu played without submitting the transfer certificate from Mohun Bagan, the club he played for last season. The points were awarded to YMCA. The committee also set February 10 as a fresh date for hearing Mohammedan Sporting captain Uday Singh regarding an alleged ball-tampering incident.          
	 The CAB has sent a letter to the BCCI requesting them to shift the venues for the upcoming National one-dayers to enclosed grounds for security reasons. A CAB official confirmed sending the letter.

                                                   DareDevils thump Kings XI by 10 wkts
                                  Vettori      
	Cape Town: Daniel Vettori and rain gods helped Delhi DareDevils score a comprehensive 10-wicket win over Kings XI Punjab in their rain-curtailed Indian Premier League (IPL) match here on Sunday.         
	Rain played spoilsport as it denied Kings XI Punjab a chance to put-up a fight since Duckworth-Lewis calculations tilted the match heavily in favour of the Delhi DareDevils.         
	The DareDevils were set an easy target of 30 runs from 25 balls, when play resumed after the second rain-interruption. Earlier delayed start had reduced the match first to 14 and then to 12 overs per side. Chasing 105 to win, Delhi raced away to 24 for no loss in 1.5 overs when the skies opened.         
	Virender Sehwag (38) and Gautam Gambhir (15) returned to the crease and scored the required 30 runs without any fuss.         
	The splendid start by openers Karan Goel (38) and Ravi Bopara (22) went in vain as the Punjab side managed a modest 104 for seven after sent in to bat at Newlands.         
	The side, led by Yuvraj Singh, were taking huge strides towards a massive score at one stage but Vettoris exceptional bowling spell changed the complexion of the game.         
	It was the New Zealand captain who not only stopped the run flow but dealt three huge blows to send shock waves through the rival camp. His spell of three for 15 from three overs tightened the screws Kings XI.         
	The run-outs of skipper Yuvraj (16) and Piyush Chawla (0) only worsened the matter for the Punjab side.         
	Left-handed Goel began with a fluent square cut boundary off Dirk Nannes and then hit Avishkar Salvi for consecutive boundaries to set the momentum.         
	Bopara, the England batsman, joined the party with two massive sixes off Pradeep Sangwan. Goel took Yo Mahesh for some special treatment, hitting him for three sixes  two from his second over. However, Yo Mahesh had the last laugh when Goel holed up to Vettori at mid-off in the last ball of the same over, bringing skipper Yuvraj to the crease.         
	Vettori trapped Bopara with the next ball, dealing the second blow to the Punjab team. The run-rate then dipped and Kumar Sangakkara, while attempting to break the shackles, ended up edging one from Vettori at fine leg.         
	With only three overs to go, Yuvraj found his timing, clouting Nannes and Vettori for sixes over wide long-on and midwicket. Just when Yuvraj seemed to be making a push towards a 120-plus score, Mahela Jayawardene called for an ill-advised run and Vettori broke the stumps with Yuvraj well short at the bowlers end.

                                                     South Africa 195 runs in front 
                  Ashwell Prince on way to his century on Friday                     
	Cape Town: Ashwell Prince and Jacques Kallis scored centuries on Friday to take South Africa to 404 for three at stumps on the second day of the third Test for a lead of 195 runs over Australia.         
	Prince smashed 19 boundaries and two sixes to hit 150 in six hours for his 11th Test century. He was eventually out caught down the leg-side off Ben Hilfenhaus.         
	Umpire Steve Bucknor, standing in his 128th and last Test, gave Prince not out, but the decision was overturned on referral by TV umpire Billy Bowden.         
	Prince added 160 for the third wicket with Kallis, whose unbeaten 102 represented his 31st Test hundred and his first since scoring 132 against India in Ahmedabad in April 2008. Kallis hit 14 fours and two sixes.         
	Australia, who lead 2-0 in the three-match series, were bowled out for 209 in their first innings at Newlands on Thursday.         
	Kallis and A.B. de Villiers (39 batting) added 82 in an unbroken stand for the fourth consecutive partnership of 65 or more in the innings. De Villiers hit five fours and a six in 64 balls.         
	Prince has had an up-and-down summer. He fractured his right thumb just before the Perth Test in December and missed the entire series in Australia as replacement J.P. Duminy excelled in a 2-1 win.         
	Prince was then left out for the first two home Tests.         
	The dropping of Neil McKenzie and injury to captain Graeme Smith meant there were two places in the top six, but Prince could only be accommodated as an opener.         
	And, while he may still prefer to bat in the middle-order, he showed on Friday that he cannot be left out of the Test team.         
	Prince was watchful in the first hour on Friday, adding just eight runs to his overnight score of 37, but later in the days first session he picked up a few boundaries.         
	Fast bowler Mitchell Johnson came in for some punishment as the left-handed batsman drove, pulled and hooked him to the fence.         
	Between lunch and tea, Prince added 49 to his score as he and Kallis took a liking to the leg spin of Bryce McGain.         
	The Test debutant was smacked for several boundaries all around the park, and conceded 102 runs in 11 overs, two of which were maidens.         
	Prince took five balls to move from 89 to his century and went from 93 to 105 by hitting fours to point, mid-off and midwicket off the first three balls of McGains second spell.         
	Kallis began his innings slowly, and took a couple of blows to the body and one to the head from the Australian seamers early on. He accelerated with his boundary-hitting off McGain.

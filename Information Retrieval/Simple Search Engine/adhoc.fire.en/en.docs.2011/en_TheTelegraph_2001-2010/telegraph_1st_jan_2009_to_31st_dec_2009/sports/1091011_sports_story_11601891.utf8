The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Muniyappa is now the sole leader 
                                                   Muniyappa is now the sole leader 
                            
	Gurgaon: C. Muniyappa held his nerve and overcame a final hole drama to hang on to his wafer-thin sole lead as seven Indians broke into the top 10 and tied places after the penultimate round of the Indian Open golf tournament here Saturday.         
	Muniyappas modest one-under 71 took his 54 hole tally to one under 26 and hot on his wheels from one stroke behind are compatriots Digvijay Singh (71) and Harinder Gupta (67), besides Australian Marcus Both (67) and Korean Lee Sung (72).         
	Veteran Mukesh Kumar (70) lie ninth at 290, one shot ahead of Gaurav Ghei (68), Ashok Kumar (68) and Amandeep Johl (69) who share the 10th place along with four others.         
	Muniyappa, however, endured some drama before being able to sign his scorecard.         
	He had been in greenside bunker in two on the par-five 18th and when clearing a wrapper from behind the ball, he appeared to brush the sand with his club head.         
	This could have led to a penalty shot but after reviewing television footage and consulting rules officials, who stood next to the bunker, tournament director David Parkin cleared the Indian of any infringement.         
	I am very happy that it is all over. It was a nervous wait, said a relieved Muniyappa.         
	The 32-year-old, a professional since 1996, is currently enjoying the finest week of his career and is exceeding all expectations. He has two top-20 finishes to his name this year on the Asian Tour and has won once on the local Indian Tour in an event last season.         
	His inexperience leading such a big tournament also showed on the par-four 17th, where he hit his tee shot with a four iron into water and took bogey. However, he showed his class earlier in the round when having fallen off the lead he birdied three holes on the trot from sixth.         
	Among others, US-based Arjun Atwal (211) turned in to be tied 17th, while rising star Gaganjeet Bhullar carded 68 to soar to tied 20th at 210.         
	Indian-born Swede Daniel Chopra (214) brought home his first over-par card and Satudays five pushed him down to tied 31st.         
	Former US Open champion Michael Campbell (221) could not impress either and slid to tied 66th after going six-over 78. (PTI)

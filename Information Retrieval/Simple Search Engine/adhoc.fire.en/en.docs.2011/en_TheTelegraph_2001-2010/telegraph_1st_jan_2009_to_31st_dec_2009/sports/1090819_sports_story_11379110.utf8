The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United aim to maintain good start
                                                   United aim to maintain good start
                      
	London: Liverpools early setback in the Premier League title race has shown Manchester United the need to maintain its winning start to the new campaign.         
	The Reds Devils are prone to stuttering starts themselves, but their quest for a record fourth straight Premier League title began with a 1-0 victory over Birmingham on Sunday, when Liverpool lost 2-1 at Tottenham.         
	You dont want to be playing catch-up, even after only one game, Manchester United defender John Shea said. Shea is likely to continue filling in at center back on Wednesday with Rio Ferdinand out with a thigh injury for at least two more weeks.         
	Wednesdays match will be Uniteds first meeting between the sides in the top flight since 1976, although Burnley defender Richard Eckersley has inside knowledge of the defending champions.         
	Liverpool, which hosts Stoke on Wednesday, also had a miserable start to the season at Tottenham. Also Wednesday, Birmingham hosts Portsmouth and Tottenham travels to Hull. (AP)

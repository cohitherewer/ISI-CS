                                                     Tactics let India down
  - MoM Malik says timing of Bhajjis introduction made a difference       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Rahul Dravid on his way back to the pavilion, at SuperSport Park in Centurion, on Saturday                                 
	Johannesburg: Around half-an-hour had gone after the fall of the last Indian wicket (Harbhajan Singhs), but Mahendra Singh Dhoni hadnt been able to accept the 54-run loss to Pakistan in the Champions Trophy.         
	Indeed, the Team India captains body language gave it away when he came for the customary post-match media conference, in Centurion, late on Saturday. His tone confirmed that hed been devastated.         
	The way things went, I was three bowlers short in the middle... I didnt know whom to bowl, whom to turn to... Its not that I only missed a specialist fifth bowler, Dhoni, who recently took India to No.1 (No.3 after the big defeat) in the ICCs ODI rankings, said.         
	He added: One can set the field for the bowlers, but one cant go and bowl... We bowled short and didnt adjust the length... The key to bowling well is adapting to conditions and our bowlers didnt do so. Pakistan, on the other hand, exploited the conditions well... Youve got to be smart...         
	Just one (Ishant Sharma) among the four specialists didnt go for a minimum of 55 runs. In fact, part-timer Yusuf Pathan also conceded 56 in Pakistans total of 302 for nine.         
	To say that vice-captain Yuvraj Singh, whod dropped by to make promotional presentations during the break, was sorely missed would be an understatement.         
	Of course, Yuvis batting is there, but I missed the bowler in him, Dhoni remarked.         
	Asked why the teams most experienced bowler, Harbhajan, was introduced as late as the 26th over, by when MoM Shoaib Malik and Mohammed Yousuf had taken a stranglehold, Dhoni replied: Because if Id brought him on early, with a part-timer at the other end, the batsman wouldve played it safe against him... I wanted them to take chances...         
	The move, which surprised everybody, turned out to be a disaster and allowed Pakistan to come out of a hole (65 for three) with not a speck of dust on the duos clothes.         
	In my view, had Harbhajan been introduced early, then the result couldve been different, Malik, who is looking to carry this form through the tournament, pointed out.         
	Actually, the move to send Virat Kohli at No.4 flopped as well. Either Dhoni shouldve gone himself or sent Suresh Raina. Worse, the youngster got out to a poor shot.         
	Dhonis explanation wasnt convincing. We didnt want Kohli to come under pressure later, when the Powerplay would be taken... Thats why he was sent ahead of me and Raina... In chasing 300-plus, youve always got to be at your best... We started well, despite losing (Sachin) Tendulkar early, but lost wickets in quick succession in the later stages...         
	In an unusual coincidence, both top-scorer Rahul Dravid (76) and the second-highest scorer, the absolutely brilliant Gautam Gambhir (57) got run out. It happened... I cant explain it... You dont want to be run out...         
	Dravid, whose ODI career has been revived after almost two years, played the role he was expected to perform. In fact, his 72-run partnership for the fifth-wicket with Raina put the pressure on Pakistan and, had they not been separated, the target couldve been reached. The asking rate, after all, was manageable.         
	But, then, that was not to be.         
	Dravid was superb, as usual... He builds his innings... Yes, that partnership was growing, but I knew it was a matter of one wicket and we got Raina (205 for five in the 35th over), observed Younis Khan, the Pakistan captain.         
	Younis, incidentally, thanked an Indian friend for giving him an ayurvedic medicine to inhale, on the eve of the match, which helped clear his chest congestion. Bilkul saaf kar diya, he told The Telegraph, smiling.         
	Having played with a broken finger, Youniss stock has risen sky-high. Hes already a World T20-winning captain.

                                                   Aurelio gets Dunga call
                      
	Rio de Janeiro: Liverpool wing back Fabio Aurelio was handed the chance of snatching a place in Brazils World Cup squad when he was named for the Middle East friendlies against England and Oman next month.         
	Coach Dunga named a 24-man squad on Tuesday made up entirely of European-based players so as not to disrupt local clubs in the run-in to the Brazilian championship. Strike pair Carlos Eduardo (Hoffenheim) and Hulk (Porto) and full back Michel Bastos of Lyon have been called up for the first time.         
	Its an option of ours to bring in players with other characteristics to see how theyre going to fit in to the national team, Dunga said. (AP)

                                                   Ishant has a bright future: Imran
                      
	Islamabad: Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan feels young Indian pacer Ishant Sharma can go on to become an outstanding match-winner if he keeps himself injury-free.         
	Ishant Sharma is a great prospect in fast bowling. If he keeps himself injury-free, he can become an outstanding match-winner, Imran said in an interview.         
	The cricketer-turned-politician said he had similar view about Irfan Pathan and New Zealands Shane Bond, but both became lesser forces after a string of injuries. I predicted the same for Irfan Pathan. When I saw Irfan four years ago, he was a genuine talent. A couple of years later, I noticed slump in his speed.         
	There are certain phases in your career. I look back at Shane Bond, he was a potential fast bowler, but couldnt sustain, he said. (PTI)

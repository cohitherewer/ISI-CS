                                                   AIFF mulls action against IFA 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) is extremely unhappy with the IFA for its conduct of the Federation Cup final at the Salt Lake Stadium last December.         
	According to sources, the executive committee of the AIFF, which met in the capital on Wednesday, has decided to refer the matter to the disciplinary committee to determine whether action should be taken against the parent body of Bengal football.         
	The final, which was played on December 21, witnessed unprecedented chaos after Mohun Bagan clinched the cup. The jubilant Mohun Bagan fans invaded the ground and the prize distribution ceremony was reduced to a mess.         
	With an eye to preventing such incidents in the future, the AIFF has now decided to set up a committee to review security arrangements before the start of all national level tournaments. Fifa has issued a guideline to all national associations to constitute such a committee, sources said.         
	The meeting was also informed that the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has approved Bengals request that they be included in the Vision India programme. The AIFF has asked the IFA to stage the IFA Shield in September.         
	 The hosting of the Federation Cup, however, may remain restricted to major venues like Calcutta , Goa, Mumbai and Bangalore .         
	The other decisions:         
	 Under-21 nationals in Goa stands postponed till April 15.         
	 Santosh Trophy is to be played in May in Tamil Nadu.         
	 Durand Cup in December.         
	 2nd division I-League in late February. Preliminaries in Assam, Gurgaon and Kerala.

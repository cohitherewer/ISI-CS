The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI clarifies stand on tour of Zimbabwe 
                                                   Cricket briefs       BCCI clarifies stand on tour of Zimbabwe 
                
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Thursday said that it has not cancelled the proposed visit to Zimbabwe for a triangular series later this year but has only put the onus on the host countrys board to find a third team to complete the line-up.         
	The BCCI is committed to sending a team to Zimbabwe to play a tri-series. It is the responsibility of the Zimbabwe Cricket, being the host body, to invite and confirm the participation of a third team. The tour will take place after that happens, BCCI secretary N. Srinvasan said in a media release Thursday.         
	Indias Zimbabwe tour was scheduled after the ODI series in the West Indies, to be played after the World Twenty20 meet in England in June.     
	Steve rsquo;s view  
	 Sydney: This years Ashes series in England is shaping up to be one of the most even in years, former Australia captain Steve Waugh said on Thursday.         
	Waugh said he considered the Australians to be slight favourites but there was no reason England could not repeat their series victory at home four years ago. Weve got a very good squad, no matter who is going to be put on the park, Waugh told a luncheon in Sydney Thursday. Our top 11 players will compete against anyone. I dont see why we cant win but England will probably feel the same.         
	Australia and England are both currently in rebuilding phases and Waugh said the Ashes picture would only become clearer once the availability of players became known.    
	Pycroft referee  
	 Calcutta: Andy Pycroft of the Emirates Elite Panel of the International Cricket Council (ICC) Match Referees will be the Match Referee in the first Test between England and the West Indies at Lords from Wednesday.         
	The ICC Thursday announced details of umpire and Match Referee appointments for the upcoming Test series between England and the West Indies. While Steve Davis and Asoka de Silva will be the field umpires for both the Tests, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) will appoint the third and fourth umpires.                 
	Warne praise  
	 Centurion: Former Aussie spinner Shane Warne said that Sachin Tendulkar is the best batsman he has played against for the way he handles expectations and bad umpiring decisions.         
	Warne, who had named Tendulkar as the numero uno batsman of his era in his book Shane Warnes Century, said it was hard to pick between Tendulkar and Brian Lara, and it was the overall conduct of the Indian which was the deciding factor. Over the years there have been a lot of wonderful batsmen, so it is pretty hard to pick between Brian Lara and Sachin Tendulkar, Warne said.

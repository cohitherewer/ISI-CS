  - Strauss calls back Mathews in show of commendable sportsmanship       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            James Anderson celebrates the dismissal of Mahela Jayawardene with teammates at the Wanderers on Friday. (AFP)                                 
	Johannesburg: Captain Andrew Strauss displayed commendable sportsmanship by calling back Sri Lanka batsman Angelo Mathews during Englands opening Champions Trophy match on Friday.               
	England were 101 for three after 24 overs. Owais Shah (17) and Eoin Morgan (14) were at the crease. Paul Collingwood made 46 after the early dismissals of Andrew Strauss and Joe Denly               
	Mathews was initially run out towards the end of Sri Lankas 212 all out at the Wanderers after colliding with bowler Graham Onions going for two.         
	Joe Denlys throw from the deep would arguably have accounted for Mathews anyway but Strauss opted to ask the Sri Lankan all-rounder back to the crease as he strode towards the pavilion.         
	It was perhaps a reaction to the last time such an incident occurred in an England match when then captain Paul Collingwood later admitted regret at not pardoning New Zealands Grant Elliott in a one-day International at The Oval.         
	This reprieve was not costly, however, as Sri Lanka  on 170 for six  at the time managed just another six runs before Mathews, who rescued his side with 52 from No. 7, edged a low catch behind off Luke Wright.         
	Mathews acknowledged Strauss gesture as he left the field and England soon wrapped up the innings thanks to two wickets in as many balls by Stuart Broad.         
	Muttiah Muralidharans swashbuckling 18, from 10 balls, was terminated when Broad knocked back off-stump and Lasith Malinga suffered the same fate next delivery.         
	James Anderson, the pick of Englands attack, then finished things when he had Ajantha Mendis caught at slip in the 48th over.         
	Mathews had shared a 82-run stand with Thilina Kandamby  which had ironically come to an end via a run out earlier in Onions 10th and final over  to ensure the Sri Lankans posted a competitive score in the day-night contest.         
	Andersons excellent new-ball spell earlier provided England with a perfect start to their campaign.         
	Anderson struck twice during an opening burst of 7-2-11-2 as the bowlers made good use of the conditions.         
	Onions also claimed two wickets during a stunning opening half-a-dozen overs, which left in-form Sri Lanka reeling on 17 for four.         
	In a massive turnaround from the one-day drubbing meted out by Australia earlier this month, England revelled under the cloud cover after Strauss won the toss.         
	Lancashire pacer Anderson removed dangerous duo Tillekaratne Dilshan and Mahela Jayawardene after Onions had accounted for veteran Sanath Jayasuriya in the second over.         
	A sliced drive from Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara then left Sri Lanka, who trounced hosts South Africa in the opening match of Group B, in disarray.         
	In conditions similar to what the English attack might discover at this time of year back home, there was considerable swing and seam movement for the fast bowlers.         
	It was a mild day on the Highveld with the overcast covering of the ground encouraging.         
	England exploited it perfectly as left-hander Jayasuriya feathered an edge behind feeling for the ball around off-stump.         
	Dilshan then drilled a square drive low to Eoin Morgan at backward point before Anderson doubled his tally by nipping one back to claim a plumb lbw.

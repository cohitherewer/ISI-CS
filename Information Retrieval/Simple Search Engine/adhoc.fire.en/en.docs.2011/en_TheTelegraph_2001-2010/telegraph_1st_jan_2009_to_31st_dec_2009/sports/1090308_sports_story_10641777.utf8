The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chelsea sweep past Coventry
                                                   Chelsea sweep past Coventry
                      
	London: Didier Drogba and Alex fired Chelsea into the semi-finals of the FA Cup in a 2-0 victory at Coventry on Saturday. Guus Hiddinks team shook off the negative publicity that followed Ashley Coles arrest and drunken behaviour in a nightclub on Thursday and outplayed the second-tier Sky Blues with a goal in each half at the Ricoh Arena. Hiddink criticised the leftback for his behaviour but still started the England defender in the cup game.         
	I think that we can be very happy and satisfied with the win but also the way we played almost the total game. Its good to see that we are improving, Hiddink said after his fifth league and cup victory in a row after taking over from the fired Luiz Felipe Scolari a month ago.         
	I thought we controlled the game very well and made a very beautiful second goal which killed the game.         
	After shaving the post with a left-foot shot, Drogba gave Chelsea a 15th-minute lead by punishing some woeful Coventry defending. A poor back header by Scott Dann put teammate Ben Turner under pressure. Drogba won the ball from the defender, shrugged him off, rounded goalkeeper Keiran Westwood and fired the ball from an acute angle inside the near post with his left foot.         
	Westwood tipped a free kick from Frank Lampard over the bar and Coventry threatened when Leon Best fought off both Alex and John Terry only to fire tamely over the top.         
	Michael Essien was back in the Chelsea squad after being absent for six months because of a serious knee injury, and went on in the 65th minute for John Obi Mikel.         
	Chelseas second in the 72nd minute was a breakaway after the Blues cleared a long throw during a spell of rare Coventry pressure.         
	Defender Alex charged upfield to arrive unmarked and meet a cross from Ricardo Quaresma with a simple tap-in. (AP)

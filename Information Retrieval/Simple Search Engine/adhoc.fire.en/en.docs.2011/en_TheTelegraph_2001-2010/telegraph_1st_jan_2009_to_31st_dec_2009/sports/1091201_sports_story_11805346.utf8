The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Serena fined $82,500 for tirade
                                                                                                                       7                                        Serena fined $82,500 for tirade
                  Serena Williams with an ICC World T20 2010 commemorative bat                     
	Washington: Serena Williams was fined a record $82,500 for her US Open tirade and could be suspended from that tournament if she has another major offence at any Grand Slam in the next two years, Grand Slam administrator Bill Babcock told said on Monday.         
	Babcock said Williams faces a probationary period at tennis four major championships in 2010 and 2011. If she has another major offence at a Grand Slam tournament in that time, the fine would increase to $175,000 and she would be barred from the following U.S. Open.         
	But if she does not have another offence in the next two years, the suspension is lifted, Babcock said in a telephone interview from London. He said the previous highest fine for a Grand Slam offence was about $48,000 to Jeff Tarango in the 1990s.         
	Williams lashed out at a lineswoman after a foot-fault call at the end of her semifinal loss to eventual champion Kim Clijsters at the US Open in September.         
	Williams earned $350,000 by reaching the semi-finals, part of her more than $6.5 million in prize money in 2009, a single-season record for womens tennis. Her career prize money tops $28 million.         
	The American is an 11-time Grand Slam singles champion and ended the 2009 season at No. 1 in the WTA rankings.         
	Williams profanity-laced, finger-pointing outburst drew a $10,000 fine from the U.S. Tennis Association in September  the maximum onsite penalty a tennis player can face. But because it happened at a Grand Slam tournament, Babcock was charged with investigating whether further punishment was merited.         
	He concluded that Williams violated the major offence rule for aggravated behaviour. The Grand Slam committee  with one representative from each of the sports four major championships approved his decision Saturday.         
	Babcock said Williams has been informed of the ruling. She has been in Barbados for an exhibition tournament, and her agent did not immediately reply to a request for comment Monday.         
	Babcock said a major offence under Grand Slam rules is any conduct that is determined to be the major offence of aggravated behaviour or conduct detrimental to the game. There is no specific definition of what sort of actions constitute a major offence.         
	He said the highest possible fine that Williams could face $175,000, if she violates her Grand Slam probation  was chosen because it is the difference in winnings between reaching the quarter finals and semi-finals at the US Open. The $10,000 Williams already was docked by the USTA will be counted toward that total; thats why she is paying half of $165,000 now.         
	During the Sept. 12 match at Flushing Meadows, the foot fault  a call rarely, if ever, made at that stage of such a significant match  resulted in a double-fault for Williams, moving Clijsters one point from victory.         
	Williams paused, retrieved a ball to serve again and then stopped. She stepped toward the official, screaming, cursing and shaking the ball at her. Williams was penalised a point for that display; because it happened to come on match point, it ended the semi-final with Clijsters ahead 6-4, 7-5.

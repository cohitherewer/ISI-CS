The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Roma lack manpower vs Arsenal 
                                                   Roma lack manpower vs Arsenal 
                      
	Rome: AS Roma are decimated by injuries and suspensions before their quarter final second leg match against Arsenal in the Champions League on Wednesday. The Giallorossi need to overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit but might not have the manpower necessary for the task.         
	While captain Francesco Totti will likely play despite a bad right knee, key midfielder Daniele de Rossi is suspended, Simone Perrotta is out with a hip injury, Cicinho underwent knee surgery Monday and fellow right back Christian Panucci cant step in as a replacement.         
	Panucci was removed from Romas list of eligible players after clashing with the club and coach Luciano Spalletti over playing time.         
	Theres not many of us left, but whoever plays you can count on them giving 100 percent, said forward Mirko Vucinic. Vucinic will likely pair with Totti in attack, with Alberto Aquilani in the playmaker position despite lingering ankle pain.         
	Teenage striker Theo Walcott has returned for Arsenal, coming on as a second-half substitute in Sundays 3-0 FA Cup win over Burnley  his first appearance since dislocating his shoulder nearly four months ago.         
	 De Rossis absence could prove the most troublesome. The Italy midfielder is the only member of Romas squad besides goalkeeper Alexander Doni to have played every minute of all seven Champions League games this season. At Nou Camp in Spain, coach Pep Guardiola faces the biggest test of his debut season when Barcelona meet Lyon. The French champions have a challenge of their own with striker Karim Benzema still doubtful to start.         
	Guardiola will be without captain Carles Puyol after the Spain defender was sidelined for three weeks when he injured his left ankle against Athletic Bilbao on Saturday.         
	In Porto, FC Porto host Atletico Madrid. Having conceded two goals at home in the first leg, the Spanish club know they need to chase victory.         
	Atletico were held 2-2 by Porto two weeks ago, but are buoyant ahead of the game.           (AGENCIES)

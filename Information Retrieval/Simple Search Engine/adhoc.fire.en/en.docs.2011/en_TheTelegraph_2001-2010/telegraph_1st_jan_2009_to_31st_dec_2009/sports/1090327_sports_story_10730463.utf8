                                                     Buchanan, Sourav speak, just a little
    - THE DAY AFTER THE KKR CAPTAINCY STORM           A STAFF REPORTER            John Buchanan and Sourav Ganguly at the Eden on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: The second day of the second phase of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) preparatory camp was a much-awaited one. Everybody wanted to see how Sourav Ganguly and John Buchanan face each other after Wednesdays declaration that KKR will have multiple captains.         
	But on Thursday, at the Eden, KKRs cricket manager Buchanan and Sourav avoided each other for the better part of the day. The practice session, which lasted for about three hours, began at 2pm without Buchanan, who arrived an hour late. It was only at the end of the days workout that Buchanan and Sourav had a brief chat.         
	As it is, only four players from the KKR squad  Sourav, Arindam Ghosh, Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Sourav Sarkar  attended the camp. Some other players, summoned by the KKR management to help out in practice, were visibly of a poor standard, dropping too many catches.         
	The session started with fielding coach John Deeble engaging the players in drills which concentrated mainly on catching. Buchanan, who attended a programme of a city-based NGO in the morning, came in at 3pm but did not play an active part in the practice session. He initially kept himself busy chalking out plans on the board, and later watched the batting and bowling practice from a distance.         
	Sourav and Buchanan crossed each other on a number of occasions, but did not communicate. The lack of interaction between the two was quite conspicuous because of the fact that Sourav was chatting with others.         
	The KKR players had batting practice in simulated match situations on Thursday. But the lack of quality bowlers, coupled with some pathetic fielding, reduced the event to a farce.         
	Arindam was the most impressive player of the day, first taking some fine catches during the fielding drills, and then slamming a couple of huge sixes.         
	It was Buchanan who went up to Sourav, as the left hander was heading towards the dressing room. Both talked for a few minutes before parting ways.         
	When the Australian was questioned on the captaincy issue, he replied: I will talk to you in two days.

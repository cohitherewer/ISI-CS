The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 4-fold increase in prize money 
                                                     4-fold increase in prize money 
            A STAFF REPORTER    
	Calcutta: Eight teams will fight out in the ICC Champions Trophy for a prize money of $4 million, almost a four-fold increase, from September 22 to October 5.         
	The re-modelled short, sharp event of 15 matches in only 14 days will take place at two venues  Centurion Park and The Wanderers.         
	For the first time, the ICC Champions Trophy will feature only the top eight sides in the world in the 50-over format. It is the last major tournament, to be played in this format, before the 2011 World Cup in the Asian sub-continent.         
	The teams  Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, hosts South Africa, Sri Lanka and the West Indies  have been divided into two pools of four, with the top two from each pool progressing to the semi-finals stage.         
	The action begins on September 22 with hosts South Africa in action against Sri Lanka in a day-night encounter at Centurion Park. The tournament will end with a day-night final at the same venue on October 5.         
	Holders Australia will begin their title defence against the West Indies, in a repeat of the 2006 final, in a day game at The Wanderers on September 26.         
	The same day will see another blockbuster as India take on arch-rivals Pakistan in a day-night encounter at Centurion Park.         
	This short, sharp event, with its new format involving only the top eight sides in the world in nation-versus-nation action, should be a fantastic spectacle to follow on from the others that have already taken place in the ICCs centenary year, ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said.         
	The format, with two pools of four leading to the semi-finals and final, means that every match counts and each side has to hit the ground running.         
	The ICC will announce the details of how to purchase match tickets in Johannesburg on July 23.         
	The sides to have won the Champions Trophy are South Africa (Bangladesh, 1998), New Zealand (Kenya, 2000), India and Sri Lanka (joint winners after the final was washed out in Sri Lanka, 2002), the West Indies (England, 2004) and Australia (India, 2006).

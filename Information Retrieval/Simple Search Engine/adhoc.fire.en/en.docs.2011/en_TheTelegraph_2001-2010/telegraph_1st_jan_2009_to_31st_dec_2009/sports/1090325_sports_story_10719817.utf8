The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods top spot under threat
                                                     Woods top spot under threat
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Tiger Woods                           
	Tiger Woods is in danger of surrendering his position as world No.1 to Phil Mickelson in two weeks time.         
	Woods has been top for 198 consecutive weeks but his commanding lead was whittled away as he spent eight months on the sidelines following reconstructive knee surgery after his US Open triumph in June.         
	The No.1 is now only 0.20 points ahead of his fellow American and if Woods fails to win this weeks Arnold Palmer Invitational in Florida, victory for Mickelson at the following weeks Houston Open would put the left-hander top.         
	Mickelson, who has never been No.1, is taking this week off.         
	It is astonishing someone can effectively take around a year off, because after the US Masters in April he only played again at the US Open in June, and still hang on to the No.1 spot, Ian Barker, who manages the official rankings, said on Monday.         
	Woods was also top for 264 consecutive weeks between 1999-2004.         
	The next longest run is Australian Greg Normans 96-week spell as world No.1 from 1995-97.

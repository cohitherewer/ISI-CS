	Nagpur: Ravindra Jadejas gutsy 77 and an unbeaten 36 from Munaf Patel guided Rest of India (RoI) to 260 in their first innings against Ranji Champions Mumbai on the opening day of their Irani Trophy clash Thursday.         
	RoI were in for an early shock as India discard Ajit Agarkar (3/45) removed captain Virender Sehwag (10) in the fifth over and then ended the 69-run stand between Murli Vijay (17) and Abhinav Mukund (47) by castling the latter.         
	Down the order, Jadeja waged a grim battle and top-scored with a 121-ball 77, but things could have been a lot worse for RoI had Munaf not come up with some lusty blows during his 34-ball 36 before he ran out of partners.         
	In reply, Mumbai were 38 without loss at stumps with Sahil Kukreja (11) and Wasim Jaffer (24) seeing off the final eight overs.         
	All eyes were on Sehwag, who returned to competitive cricket after a shoulder surgery, but the star opener let his team down and fell to Agarkar early in the innings.         
	Vijay and Mukund stemmed the rot but once Agarkar broke their stand, RoI witnessed a middle order collapse. Dhawal Kulkarni ended Vijays long vigil at the crease after the batsman struggled his way to 17 after facing 76 balls.         
	Jadeja, however, stood tall amid the ruins and played sensibly.           (PTI)

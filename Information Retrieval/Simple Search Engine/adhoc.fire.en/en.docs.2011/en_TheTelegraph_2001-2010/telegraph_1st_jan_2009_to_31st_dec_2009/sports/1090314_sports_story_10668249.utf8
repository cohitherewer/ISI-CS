The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ferguson defends Rooney
                                                     Ferguson defends Rooney
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Wayne Rooney                           
	Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has moved to defend Wayne Rooney after the England striker told of how he hates Liverpool ahead of the two sides top of the table meeting at Old Trafford.         
	The comments were made on MUTV in the immediate aftermath of Wednesday nights Champions League win over Inter Milan and were eventually removed from Uniteds official website Thursday afternoon for fear of inflaming passions ahead of Saturdays encounter.         
	Im very excited about the game because I grew up as an Everton fan hating Liverpool. And that hasnt changed!         
	Were in pole position in the title race and we know if we can beat Liverpool, then that will more or less end their chances of winning the League.         
	As an Everton supporter, a former Everton player and a member of Manchester Uniteds Champions League-winning team, Rooney has always been a target for abusive Liverpool fans. And it is little surprise to learn that the feeling of antipathy is a mutual one. However, Ferguson has claimed that Rooney was guilty of little more than an injudicious turn of phrase.         
	Hate is an easy word to say, easier than dislike. Maybe it is not the right word, said Ferguson.         
	But Wayne has had plenty of stick from Liverpool fans over the years, so it is understandable. He supported Everton as a kid and the rivalry between them and Liverpool is pretty ferocious now. Since then he has come to Manchester United and he wants to win. It is nothing out of the ordinary really.         
	There has never been any love lost between the two sides, a fact Ferguson recognised as soon as he came down from Aberdeen and vowed to knock the Merseyside outfit off their perch as the top team in England.         
	United are chasing an 18th league title to match Liverpools long-standing record, something that further adds to the intrigues of the contest.         
	Liverpool have always been our main rival, said Ferguson. It does not matter what the position in the league, as far as I am concerned, it has always been the derby game. It will always be that way because of the geography and history of the two cities. We are the two most successful football clubs in England. When they get together you expect sparks to fly.         
	Meanwhile, Cristiano Ronaldo has again reiterated his desire to remain a United player for the foreseeable future. The Portuguese wingerinsists: The team are playing very well, I feel very happy here and I want to stay here. Only God knows the future, but I dont want to go anywhere.

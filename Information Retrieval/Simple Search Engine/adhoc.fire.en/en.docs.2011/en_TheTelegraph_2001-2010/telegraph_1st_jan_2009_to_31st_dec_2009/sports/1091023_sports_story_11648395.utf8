The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | NZC backs Moles as players revolt
                                                   NZC backs Moles as players revolt
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Trouble is brewing in New Zealand cricket as some players have voiced concerns over coach Andy Moles coaching abilities and dont want him to continue at the helm.         
	However, Moles has got the New Zealand Cricket (NZC)s support to retain his post.         
	New Zealand Cricket has confirmed Andy Moles position as the New Zealand coach. This confirmation comes in response to news reports speculating on Moless future as coach of the side, NZC said in a statement responding to reports in Wellington that senior players want Moles to be sacked.         
	NZC chief executive Justin Vaughan reaffirmed Moles as the coach and said he is preparing the side for forthcoming tour to the United Arab Emirates for an ODI and Twent20 International series against Pakistan.         
	Following the Black Caps return from Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy we are undertaking a review of the teams performance, Vaughan said.         
	This looks at all aspects of individual and collective performance with a view to continuous improvement, he added.         
	The Dominion Post reported that senior players of the side have made it clear to NZC that Moles has been of no help in the past few months with captain Daniel Vettori doing the job of leading and coaching the side.         
	Moles is understood to be entering mediation talks with NZC after players effectively expressed a vote of no confidence in him when they returned from the nine-week tour of Sri Lanka and South Africa, the report said.         
	Senior players approached NZC on their return from South Africa, complaining Moles had not provided them with an acceptable level of tactical or technical support.         
	 It was also said captain Vettori had effectively been coaching the side for the last six months, it added.

                                                   Ready for India: Sara
                      
	Sydney: New Zealand all-rounder Sara McGlashan feels her side would prove quite a handful for the Indian women in their World Cup Super Six stage match on Tuesday despite the Jhulan Goswami led sides strong showing in their shock defeat of Australia.         
	It is always a well-fought match when you play the Indian girls and they are similar to us in terms of the pace and spin bowlers that they have. The girls do enjoy playing them and hopefully we will have a really good match on Tuesday, said Sara, whose brother Peter is part of the mens team.         
	India will be a big game. We played against them and lost in the warm-up game and they will be on a high after beating the Aussies, so it will be a matter of making sure we know what we need to do on the day, the all-rounder added.         
	New Zealand remained unbeaten in the group stage and Sara said the competition was heating up.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England thump WI by six wickets
                                                     England thump WI by six wickets
                  Collingwood                     
	Bristol: Paul Collingwood hit an unbeaten 47 and took three for 16 as England beat the West Indies by six wickets in the second one-day International on Sunday to take a 1-0 lead in the three-game series.         
	Ravi Bopara hit 43 and Owais Shah 38 as England reached 161 for four off 36 overs at Bristols County Ground to surpass the West Indies 160 all out in 38.3 overs. England paceman Stuart Broad took four for 46, his wickets coming at the beginning and the end of a disappointing West Indies innings.         
	Dwayne Bravo top-scored with 50, while captain Chris Gayle hit 31. Shivnarine Chanderpaul with 27 and Darren Sammy with 13 not out were the only other batsman to reach double figures in the warm, sunny conditions.         
	England made a steady start in search of a modest total before Strauss, who had made four, tried to hook a ball from Taylor, top-edged the ball and Sammy took the catch with 31 runs on the board.         
	Prior made 11 to push the score onto 61 before he edged a catch to third slip where Gayle took it at second attempt off Sammys bowling.         
	Ravi Bopara hit five boundaries in an entertaining 43 before he was beaten by the swing and was out leg before to Bravo before Collingwood joined Shah.         
	Collingwood hit Bravo for a four and a six in the same over and then a lofted drive for four off Pollard. Shah was out trying to hit a boundary to finish the game but his powerfully hit cut was brilliantly stopped by Pollard, who then reacted quickly by hitting the stumps from 30 yards with Shah well out of his crease.         
	Eoin Morgan, who faced the West Indies while playing for Ireland in the 2007 World Cup, came out on his England debut and scored the winning run, ending unbeaten on two.         
	The first ODI at Headingley on Thursday was washed out. The two teams meet again at Edgbaston on Tuesday for the final game of series.         
	Earlier in the day, the West Indies, put in to bat, were in trouble as Broad struck twice to dismiss Lendl Simmons and Ramnaresh Sarwan with both failing to score to leave their side at 7 for two in the fourth over.         
	The visitors never really recovered from the early setback and kept losing wickets at regular intervals.           (AP)

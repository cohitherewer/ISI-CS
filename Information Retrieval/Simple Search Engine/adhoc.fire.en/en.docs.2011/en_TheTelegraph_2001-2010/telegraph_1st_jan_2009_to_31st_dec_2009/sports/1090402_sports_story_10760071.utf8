            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Wellington: New Zealand vice-captain Brendon McCullum is banking on the tough conditions here for his team to level the series when the third and final Test starts here Friday. Talking to the media on Wednesday, McCullum said if the hosts can play as well as they did in Napier, a win is possible.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On the conditions         
	Very cold. But not really the golf weather. Very blustery and the sun hasnt really shone much. Hopefully, the pitch will respond to that and provide us with a little bit of bounce. I think they (India) will find it a little bit cold. If we find it cold here, no doubt theyll be freezing. Im sure, from their point of view, they will be hoping that the wind dies down and the sun comes out but from ours, itll be great to have them on the park when the conditions are like this. Im sure were going to find the conditions a little bit more pleasant than they are.         
	How will the pitch behave?         
	Its usually a pretty good surface, but a lot depends on the overhead conditions over the next few days. That will determine whether some moisture is there, or it remains dry and plays flat. Well just have to wait and see.         
	Is the team confident about making the series 1-1?         
	More confident than we were after the Hamilton Test. Its just the way we competed in the last game. We should be a little bit wary about the confidence we have. But I guess when you have come off a 10-wicket loss in the first Test, your confidence is really dented, and when you respond the way we did, particularly after being three for 20 on the first day, is a pretty good sign for the team. The boys are a lot more confident now than they were a week ago.         
	If he is surprised that his team is commanding more respect from the media after the second Test         
	Thats cricket in general. You are evaluated by how you perform in your last game. At the moment, we are confident but we do have to step up and make sure we play as well as we did in the last Test. If we create the opportunities or stick to the plans like we did in the last Test, I think well get slightly better results.         
	On the New Zealand openers performance in the series         
	It does put pressure on the middle-order but it is not for lack of trying. The openers are trying to do everything they can to get a start. We are still confident that even if we dont get a start, we are capable of turning it around like we saw the other day with Ross (Taylor) and Jesse (Ryder). You cant be too concerned about how other people are doing. You just try and make sure you remain confident and do your own job.         
	On Tim McIntosh         
	Tims had a bit of bad luck. In the last two Tests, he hasnt had the greatest of decisions. But Tim works hard and he will get results. He still remains confident through the work he does at nets; if he gets in in this Test, Im sure he will score heavily for us.         
	On Tim Southees return to the squad         
	Tim Southee has learnt a few good lessons out of it (remaining out of the side). Its great to have him back in the environment. He is constantly laughing and joking away. Its good to have him back. I am sure if he gets a game, he will do really well.         
	On the Indian batsmens superb performance during the ODI series         
	I think they targeted any bowler, or every bowler, in that one-day series. The boundaries were small and the wickets were flat and the guys were really good. It was always going to be tough for our bowlers. Unfortunately, we werent able to respond well but they have done it to many bowlers over the years.         
	If the Indians can be equally aggressive in the Test         
	Ill be surprised if they target the bowlers in the Test match as well, purely because they are 1-0 up in the series. I would imagine they wouldnt necessarily try to force it as much as they did in the one-dayers. If they do, then it might provide some sort of opening for us as well. But from our point of view, we are just trying to make sure that we control the areas that we can control and put ourselves in a position from where we can walk away 1-1.         
	On his personal targets  
	You always want to take up more responsibility. Being the vice-captain of the side and after being around for a little while, you rsquo;ve got to start backing up performances and scoring heavily. You should be able to make contributions that actually win Test matches.

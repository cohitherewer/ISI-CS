The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pak to miss Asif vs Black Caps
                                                   Pak to miss Asif vs Black Caps
                      
	Karachi: Pacer Mohammed Asif will not feature in Pakistans series against New Zealand as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has not been able to facilitate his entry into Dubai due to a dope case.         
	The Dubai authorities had banned his entry into the United Arab Emirates last year after he was caught with drugs while returning from India after participating in the inaugural Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	The chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), Ejaz Butt, Monday confirmed that they could not get clearance from the UAE authorities for Asif to travel with the team to Abu Dhabi and Dubai.         
	We did our best, but due to shortage of time, the matter has not been resolved as yet. So Asif will not be part of the team that plays against New Zealand, he said.         
	Asif had been detained for 19 days in Dubai. Though the authorities released him without any criminal charges, he was deported to Pakistan, which means he can not enter the UAE without clearance.         
	The bowler was also fined by the PCB. It had sent him on a separate flight to Johannesburg, via Qatar, for the Champions Trophy, even though the team went via Dubai.         
	Butt added that since Asif was in good form in domestic cricket, he would be considered for the coming Test series in New Zealand and Australia.         
	Twenty six year old Asif has played 11 Tests, 32 one-dayers and nine Twenty20 internationals so far.         
	He made his Test and ODI debut for Pakistan in 2005, and became one of his countrys premier bowlers. But doping and injury have harmed his progress as an international cricketer.

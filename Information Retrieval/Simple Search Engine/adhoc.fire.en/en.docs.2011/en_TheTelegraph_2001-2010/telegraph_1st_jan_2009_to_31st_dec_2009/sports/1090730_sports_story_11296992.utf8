                                                   Mediator hints at August deadline
                      
	Kingston: Settlement of the impasse over players contract between the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) and the West Indies Players Association (WIPA) may be reached in August.         
	Former Commonwealth Secretary General Sridath Ramphal, who was appointed to mediate the negotiation between WICB and WIPA, after meeting the representatives from both the sides set the deadline, saying they were keen on moving swiftly towards a resolution to the dispute.         
	The parties, who were with me together over those many hours, and I share that view that weve got to get on with this quickly, Ramphal said.         
	My own timeline  although the meeting hasnt put a time on it  my own personal hope is that we can see this process through within August, he told the Caribbean Media Corporation (CMC) Sports.         
	By the end of August, this should be a process done and put behind us with a line drawn in the sand and with the future for West Indies cricket and the whole region, and indeed international sport (settled), he added.         
	Ramphal said the issue could not be taken lightly as it involved the interest of West Indies cricket.         
	West Indies cricket cannot afford a long stalemate, which is the situation we are in now. These issues that so trouble the game in the West Indies, trouble the game in the world and Im sure that England and Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India  they are all looking.         
	At this intimate process and hoping that the West Indies will get its act together and resume its prominent place in world cricket, he said.         
	The players refused to play Test and one-day series against Bangladesh which forced the selectors to field a second string squad. (PTI)

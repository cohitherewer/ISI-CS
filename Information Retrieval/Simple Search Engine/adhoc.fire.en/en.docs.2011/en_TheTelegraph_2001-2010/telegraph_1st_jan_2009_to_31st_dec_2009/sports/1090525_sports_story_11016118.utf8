The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chandhok let down by drive shaft
                                                   Chandhok let down by drive shaft
                      
	Monaco: Karun Chandhok was on course for a win in the Monaco GP2 race but a drive shaft failure just eight laps from the chequered flag cost the Indian racing sensation a deserving victory here Sunday.         
	Chandhok got off to a good start by qualifying in the 10th place for the feature race but a traffic congestion saw him slip to the 15th spot before he made amends by finishing seventh.         
	Starting second in race two, Chandhok was dominating but disaster struck just eight laps from the end as his drive shaft failure forced him to retire.         
	I am gutted, words cant describe how I feel right now. Ever since I was a child, my dream has been to win in Monaco and I was robbed of it today. Without any warning, I lost drive instantly as I came down the start-finish straight and just could not believe this was happening, Chandhok said after the race.         
	The team is also distraught as this would have been our first win in just their second weekend of GP2, having dominated the race, but unfortunately, this is motorsport, he added.

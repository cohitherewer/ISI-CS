The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vijender scales the peak
                                                     Vijender scales the peak
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Vijender Singh                           
	New Delhi: Olympic bronze medallist Vijender Singh on Tuesday became the first Indian to be ranked the No. 1 middleweight pugilist in the world by the International Boxing Association (AIBA).         
	Vijender, who recently won the countrys first bronze medal in the World Championships in Milan, has topped the points tally in the 75 kg section with 2700 points, followed Emillo Correa Bayeux of Cuba, who has 2500 points. Abbos Atoev of Uzbekistan , who defeated Vijender in Milan , is in the third position with 2100 points.         
	Vijender was No. 2 in the chart when the AIBA launched the official world rankings for the first time last month in an effort to determine seedings, which was also used during the recent World meet.         
	The lists are compiled according to the number of points won by boxers in different ranking events like the Olympics, the World Championships, the Youth World Championships and the continental meets. Since more points are awarded in the Olympics and the World Championships, Vijender has found a place ahead of many of his fancied rivals.         
	This honour is like winning another international medal, said Vijender. The No. 1 ranking is the recognition of my continuous hard work and consistency at the top level. Now, the most important task is to maintain my position at the top, he added.         
	Vijender said he was now motivated to perform better in future. I am not a person who takes things lightly in the ring. Now that I have been clubbed with the best, my effort would be to do better in international tournaments, Vijender commented.         
	National coach G.S. Sandhu said Vijenders elevation to the top spot was the result of his dedication to the sport. During practice sessions, Vijender would carefully listen to every instruction of his coach. Other boxers sometime tend to forget the advice, but Vijender would never do the same mistake twice, Sandhu said.         
	The Olympic medal, Sandhu felt, made Vijender a hugely confident boxer. In the Milan World meet, after Vijender had a look at the draw, he declared he was going to win a medal. I have never seen an Indian boxer expressing such confidence in an international meet, said Sandhu.         
	Former world youth champion Thokchom Nanao Singh has lost three places to grab the eighth position with 1400 points in the light flyweight (48kg) category. Olympian Akhil Kumar has gone down a rung to 10th spot in the featherweight (57kg) category with 1050 points while Suranjoy Singh was 17th in the flyweight (51kg) category.         
	World Championships quarter finalist Dinesh Kumar has retained the sixth spot with 1550 points in the light weight (81kg) category.

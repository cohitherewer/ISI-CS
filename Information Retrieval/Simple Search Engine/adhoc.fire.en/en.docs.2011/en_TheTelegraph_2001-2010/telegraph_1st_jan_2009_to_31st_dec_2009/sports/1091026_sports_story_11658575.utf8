                                                   Ponting: Bowlers have work to do 
                      
	Vadodara: After narrowly escaping defeat in the series opener, Australia captain Ricky Ponting Sunday said his bowlers will have to pull up their socks when it comes to bowling at the death.         
	The visitors had India on the mat at 201 for seven before Harbhajan Singh (49) and Praveen Kumar (40 ..) came up with a mesmerising 84-run stand for the eighth wicket off just 54 deliveries, to raise visions of a come-from-behind victory for India.         
	Ponting singled out Shane Watson, who had a torrid time in the later stages of the India innings, saying the burly all-rounder has to go back to the drawing board before the second ODI in Nagpur on Wednesday.         
	We had bowled very well in the first 45 overs. We need to do better in our death bowling. There are lessons to be learnt. (Peter) Siddle bowled a splendid last over. He has done it before, he said. (PTI)

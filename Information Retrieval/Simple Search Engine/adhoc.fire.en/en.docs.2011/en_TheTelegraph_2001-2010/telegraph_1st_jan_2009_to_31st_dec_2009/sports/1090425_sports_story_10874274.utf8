The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Time for the Knight Riders to   prove they mean business
                                                     Time for the Knight Riders to   prove they mean business
          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            John Buchanan                                       
	Cape Town: The joke doing the rounds is that there are more captains/leaders than performers in the Kolkata Knight Riders ranks.         
	All thanks to the multiple captains/leaders concept floated (and, then, more or less discarded) by the franchises head of cricket operations, John Buchanan.         
	Shah Rukh Khan may not be amused, but hes played a significant part in confusing things within his own team. Not least by a series of flip-flops on the captaincy and the manner of Sourav Gangulys removal.         
	Poor Brendon McCullum (the new captain) has had to deal with plenty on his plate, including perhaps the approach he ought to be taking while opening. On the evidence of the first three matches in this years IPL, it seems the free-flowing element has gone from his game.         
	Of course, much cricket remains to be played in this edition and, so, the Knights could stage a recovery. Right now, though, few would put enough Rands on that.         
	To send a we-actually-mean-business message, the Knights will first have to put it across the Chennai Super Kings, at Newlands, on Saturday.         
	Both teams have just one win from three matches.         
	Its to be seen just how much of a difference it makes on the field, but the Knights wont have to contend with Andrew Flintoff, who has returned to England for one more surgery.         
	Flintoff hadnt been bowling well, but it wouldve been foolish to write him off.         
	After such a draining game, on Thursday, the Knights took a day off cricket.         
	While McCullum decided to play golf, most of the others took the 45-minute drive to Cape Point, where the Indian and Atlantic Oceans meet.         
	The belief being that getting the Super Over defeat, at the hands of the Rajasthan Royals, out of the system, would help against the Super Kings.         
	After the match, by the way, the Knights had a team dinner at an Ethiopian restaurant. Shah Rukh wasnt present. In fact, he didnt meet the McCullums after the loss.         
	We didnt finish on the right side, but the game has been the winner... The outcome will help lift the tournament, Buchanan told The Telegraph.         
	Meanwhile, one learns that the Knights may drop Sanjay Bangar and field Arindam Ghosh instead.         
	Match starts: 8 pm (IST).

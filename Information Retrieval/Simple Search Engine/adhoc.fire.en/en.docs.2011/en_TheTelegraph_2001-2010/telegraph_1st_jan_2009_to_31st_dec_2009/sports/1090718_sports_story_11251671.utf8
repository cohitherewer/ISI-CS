                                                   CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	 Sachin still good for T20: Amre
    
	New Delhi: Former India coach Pravin Amre on Friday described John Buchanans criticism of Sachin Tendulkars abilities in the T20 format as a publicity stunt.  
	It is wrong to question Sachins abilities in any format of the game. Even at this stage of his career, he has played all the Indian Premier League matches and demonstrated his commitment to the game. I believe all this criticism is just a publicity stunt.               
	Bird cleared   
	Calcutta: Cricket Australia on Friday lifted the ban on New South Wales pacer Aaron Bird after biomechanical analysis of his bowling action showed that it complied with CAs tolerance level. The 25-year-old pacer was reported for a suspected illegal bowling action on January 30 and was accordingly tested under the Cricket Australia Doubtful Bowling Action Procedures on February 11.  
	Jones dumped   
	London: Former England fast bowler Simon Jones, an integral part of 2005 Ashes winning England squad, will not have his contract renewed by county team Worcestershire. Jones, 30, played in 18 Tests and last appeared for England at Trent Bridge in the 2005 series against Australia.  
	Vaas recalled   
	Colombo: Sri Lanka recalled seasoned left-arm seamer Chaminda Vaas for the final cricket Test against Pakistan at the Sinhalese Sports Club starting Monday, but star spinner Muttiah Muralidharan, nursing a knee injury, was again left out.  
	The squad         
	Kumar Sangakkara (capt.), Mahela Jayawardene, Tharanga Paranavitana, Malinda Warnapura, Thilan Samaraweera, Tillekaratne Dilshan, Angelo Mathews, Rangana Herath, Nuwan Kulasekera, Thilan Thushara, Chaminda Vaas, Ajantha Mendis, Chamara Kapugedera, Kaushal Silva, Suranga Lakmal, Dhamikka Prasad.               
	Chinese cricket   
	Karachi: Pakistans Rashid Khan and Indias Mamatha Maben are working together as coaches to help raise the mens and the womens cricket teams for China and popularising the game in the country ahead of the 2010 Asian Games. For the first time in the Asian Games history, the organisers have included cricket as a discipline in both mens and womens categories to compete in the Twenty20 format of the sport in Ganghzou.  
	Sohail plan   
	Karachi: Pakistans former Test captain Aamer Sohail has said he would decide on his future in the Pakistan Cricket Board in the next few days as rumours of his resignation as director of game development has been doing the rounds. No I have not resigned as yet and if I do this, I will inform the media. But yes, I will take a decision on my future in the board in the next few days, he admitted.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Suspect action kept Botha out

	 Suspect action kept Botha out
    Cape Town: Suspect bowling action has cost South African off-spinner Johan Botha a chance to play for defending champions Rajasthan Royals in the high profile Indian Premier League.         
	According to media reports, Botha was in line for a lucrative contract with the Royals in the weeks prior to the Twenty20 tournament. But the IPL franchise dropped the idea after the off-spinner was reported for suspect action during the fourth ODI against Australia in Port Elizabeth recently. The Royals were understood to have been the team most interested in acquiring Bothas services for the second season of the IPL in the absence of last years Most Valuable Player Shane Watson, the highest wicket-taker Sohail Tanvir and Australian speedster Shaun Tait.               
	 Row Resolved
    Johannesburg: Decks were cleared for the Wanderers to host eight Indian Premier League matches after the IPL organisers and the Gauteng Cricket Board settled the row over VIP hospitality suites.         
	While IPL organisers demanded complete control over the corporate suites, the GCB had earlier refused to bend, resulting in a stand-off. IPL chairman Lalit Modi said the Wanderers would host all eight matches as per schedule and tickets for the first game on May 2 between Delhi Daredevils and Chennai Super Kings will go on sale Thursday.                 
	 Strategy Breaks 
    Durban: Indian Premier League chairman Lalit Modi has admitted that the strategy breaks in the ongoing second season have not gone down too well with a section of players but insisted that the experiment will continue.         
	The seven-and-half-minute break at the end of every 10 overs has been criticised for slowing down the pace of the game with some players complaining that it was also disturbing their rhythm. Star players like Sachin Tendulkar have rejected the idea, saying that the breaks have only broken the momentum of the matches.               
	 Vettori view
    Cape Town: Long before the start of the Indian Premier League (IPL), New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori had suggested that the tired, end-of-season pitches in South Africa would see spinners play a serious role in the tournament. And it is turning out to be exactly so!           (AGENCIES)

	Calcutta: Yuki Bhambri continued his cakewalk into the last eight of the ONGC-ITF F10 Futures event at the Bengal Tennis Association on Wednesday.         
	The 17-year-old Davis Cupper defeated Chin-Yu Huang, a qualifier from Chinese Taipei, 6-4, 6-1. Serving for the first set, the fifth seed slammed two aces to clinch it.         
	US-based eighth seed Rupesh Roy and seventh-seed Rohan Gajjar had to fight hard for victory in their respective pre-quarter final matches.         
	Rupesh beat Vignesh Peranamallur Chandrasekhar 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 while Rohan played a 181 minute marathon to overcome qualifier Mithun Murali 6-2, 6-7(4-7), 6-4.         
	Despite being up 3-0 in the first set, Rupesh made numerous unforced errors to lose his temper and the set. But he made amends by coming back strongly in the next two sets.         
	However, it was the end of the road for Rupesh in the doubles event. The third seed pair of Rupesh and Vivek Shokeen lost to the Indo-Korean duo of Yuki and Young-Jun Kim 3-6, 4-6.         
	National grass court champion and third seed Vishnu Vardhan cruised into the quarters with a 6-3, 6-4 defeat of Vijayant Malik in 98 minutes.         
	Top seed Daniel King-Turner of New Zealand was stretched by N. Vijay Sundar Prashanth before he won 6-0, 2-6, 6-3 in 114 minutes.

                                                                                                                       7                                        Jeev looks to enter top 30
                  Jeev Milkha Singh                     
	Chandigarh: Jeev Milkha Singh has set himself the twin targets of staying fit and breaking into the top 30 in golf rankings next year.         
	My main aim is to remain fit in the coming year and the main goal is to move into the top 30, Jeev said.         
	This year was average for me. But now I have my US PGA Tour card (for next year), the golfer said.         
	After a fairytale 2008  Jeev won four titles on three different tours  the current year was largely forgettable for the Chandigarh pro who slipped out of the top 50 in world rankings after failing to add any trophies to his cabinet.         
	Jeev had to deal with persistent injuries and the golfer said he would do everything in his powers to stay injury-free in the year ahead.         
	I will work hard on my fitness, he said.         
	Now its perfectly fine. I am fit and there is no problem, Jeev said.         
	The rise of youngsters like Gaganjeet Bhullar and C. Muniyappa  both of them won Asian Tour titles this year  has got Jeev excited and the golfer advised them to have faith in their abilities.         
	There is a lot of talent in the country. These boys have put in hard work and have the potential to become champions.         
	They just need to believe in themselves and also believe that they are as good as anybody else, Jeev said.         
	As to his game, Jeev said he had changed his irons to conform to the groove rules, which come into effect from January 2010.         
	The changes, which will require V-shaped grooves on irons, would make the game more challenging as spinning the golf ball will become more difficult, Jeev said. (PTI)

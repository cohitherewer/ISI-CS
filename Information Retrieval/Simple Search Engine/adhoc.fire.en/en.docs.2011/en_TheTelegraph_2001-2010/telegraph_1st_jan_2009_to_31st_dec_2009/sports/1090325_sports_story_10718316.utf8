            STAR RACER                                
	Calcutta: Caution is the watch-word in Wednesdays eight events. Fields are big, though nothing unusual about it, but most of the events in days card are packed with horses known for their inconsistent form. Punters are better advised to exercise utmost restrain.          
	The afternoons feature-event, the 1,400m Star Magic Cup, too, is a teaser. There are 14 in the line-up but none of the horses boast of winning at the top-end of the combined classes  III and IV. Solid Success, Romantic Quest, Artistical and Italian Star, have, however, come close to striking in their previous outings and they, including the recent winner, Crown Princess, are expected to fight out the issue. Among them, Italian Star appears to have the best credentials to win in view of his recent performance when he troubled Agios Nikolaos. Ashhad Asbar partners John Stephens trainee.

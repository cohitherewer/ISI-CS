            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Sri Lanka all-rounder Angelo Mathews admitted that he was in tears after falling short of his maiden Test century Thursday, when he was run out for 99.                 
	The following are excerpts               
	Falling one run short of a century         
	Very disappointed... The first Test hundred is a big achievement for any cricketer.         
	His run out         
	I thought that was two runs. I dragged the bat way into the crease on my first run that was why I got run out.         
	Whether he was upset         
	Back in the dressing room, I was thinking about it a bit longer. Then, I recovered when we went out to field. There were a few tears. All the senior players, including the captain, said it was okay and that it was part and parcel of the game.         
	His game plan         
	I was under pressure coming into this Test. I had failed in three innings, so I had to score and get into some form.         
	Living up to the expectations         
	I need to be patient I am working hard on my bowling and, so, hopefully, it will be better in the future. The team management never puts pressure on me They tell me to go out there and enjoy it.         
	The pitch         
	Yesterday (Wednesday), in the morning session, it was turning a quite a lot but as the day progressed, it got better. In the morning, too, it was better than yesterday and it wasnt turning that much.         
	Whether Lanka had lost ground         
	We can come back from where we are right now. India havent won this game. Its just a matter of two-three wickets early in the morning and then wed be right back in the game. There are three more days left and anything can happen.

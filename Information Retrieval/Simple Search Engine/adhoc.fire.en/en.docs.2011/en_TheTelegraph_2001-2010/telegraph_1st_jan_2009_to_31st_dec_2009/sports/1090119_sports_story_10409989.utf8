                                                     Triple delight for Kenyan runners
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Mungara                           
	Mumbai: Kenneth Mungara smashed the course record as he led a Kenyan 1-2-3 to win the overall mens title while Ram Singh Yadav asserted himself as the countrys best by claiming the Indian crown for a third successive time in the Mumbai Marathon here Sunday.         
	Mungara shrugged off the tough weather conditions to clock 2hrs 11 minutes and 51 seconds, thus bettering the previous mark of 2:12:03 set by compatriot Rono Daniel in 2006.         
	David Tarus was second in 2:12:02 while John Kelai, aiming for a hattrick, came in third on 2:12:23, which incidentally was his gold-winning time last year.         
	Besides the humidity, the overlapping of half marathoners in the latter stage of the race also posed a hurdle for Mungara. It was Mungaras third win from the six races he has participated in so far.         
	Ram Singh Yadav was the best among the Indians with a time of 2:18:03, a creditable effort since he missed the top-10 by one spot. Deep Chand (2:26:01) and Narender Singh (2:26:41) respectively, were 21st and 23rd overall. The womens race was won by Haille Kebebush of Ethiopia in 2:34:08 with compatriot Marta Marcos (2:34:15) second and Kenyan Irene Mogaka (2:37:28) third.         
	There was disappointment for Indresh Dhiraj, the best Indian woman last year, as she was pipped by Aruna Devi.         
	Half marathon results         
	Men: 1. Surender Singh, 1h:06m:09s; 2. Santosh Kumar, 1:08:08; 3. B.C. Tilak, 1:08:35         
	Women: 1. Kavita Raut, 1:20:58; 2. Preethi Rao, 1:21:23; 3. Vaishali Chatare, 1:26:45

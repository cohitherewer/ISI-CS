The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No sport is bigger than television
                                                   No sport is bigger than television
                                  
	John McEnroe, the reformed flag bearer of screaming dissent, traumatised Wimbledon in the Eighties with his tantrums. One incident which has been replayed thousands of times on television is when while disputing a call he screamed, You cant be serious to the umpire along with a tirade of expletives.         
	The remark has now become a part of tennis folklore, and, combined with McEnroes ravings and rantings, became a benchmark high in the history of the game. At the recent US Open, Novak Djokovic mimicked the old McEnroe incident after his match to peals of laughter and invited McEnroe to play a few shots with him, which McEnroe sportingly did.         
	In the recent US Open, Serena Williams, one of the greatest women players of all time, was called a foot fault on her second serve, when down 4-6, 5-6, 15-30, giving Kim Clijsters two match points.         
	Incensed at the call, Serena advanced towards the lineswoman menacingly, waving her racket, with a ball in the other hand, and screamed, I will shove the f***ing ball down your throat and kill you. This was no innocent cattle class Tharoor twitter, but a death threat conveyed with physical intimidation. Everybody was stunned.         
	To her credit the short, puny lineswoman bravely stood her ground, did not bat an eyelid, went and reported the incident to the umpire who, after consulting the referee, awarded the match point to Clijsters on the basis of a code violation.         
	Serena stomped off in a huff and refused to apologise. Two days later, on Monday, she apologised through her website to the lineswoman, to Clijsters, to the United States Tennis Association and to the fans. She stated that she wanted to apologise to the lines woman, but could not locate her. I would like to give her a big old hug.         
	My gosh! Serenas sudden love for the lineswoman was fuelled by the fear of plummeting television ratings and the evaporation of sponsors  a fatal blow to earnings of professional tennis players.         
	One must not judge Serena harshly. After a lifetime of fighting her way through the bruising gauntlet of racist barbs, social discrimination and myriads of other obstacles, she came off the bridle for a few minutes to enjoy the freedom of language which most of us suppress.         
	The Grand Slam title which slipped away, the $10000 fine, and anything more the authorities choose to do will not hurt as much as the blow to her pride. A few years ago Serena appeared on the show court in the US Open dressed like a gladiator. At that time we dismissed it as yet another one of the Williams sisters gimmicks.         
	Sociologists or psychologists might find a deeper meaning in the raised hand with the gladiatorial attire  not a mere victory but a signal of triumph over an unfair cruel society.         
	Many youngsters  who presume that success also brings wisdom often pontificate in interviews that no body is bigger than the game, must now understand that no sport is bigger than television.         
	The 3000-tonne sliding roof at Wimbledon, which shuts out the rain, is there because television time sold for millions of pounds cannot be tampered with.         
	During the 20 years I played at Wimbledon, players were not allowed to even sit down and all one could do was to quickly gulp down some water during changeovers.         
	Television ratings and money brought Serena back to heel. In fact in modern times, in any global televised event, television calls the shots.

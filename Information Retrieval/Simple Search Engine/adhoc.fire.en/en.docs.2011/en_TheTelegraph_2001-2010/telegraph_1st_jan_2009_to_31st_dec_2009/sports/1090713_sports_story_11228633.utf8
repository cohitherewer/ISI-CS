The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Peirsol raises the bar 
                                                   Peirsol raises the bar 
                      
	Indianapolis: Aaron Peirsol broke the world record in the 200m backstroke at the US Championships on Saturday, beating previous owner Ryan Lochte and lowering his second world mark in three days.         
	The Olympic silver medallist touched in 1:53.08 seconds, bettering Olympic champion Lochtes old mark of 1:53.94 set in Beijing.         
	Im elated I went that fast, but the real work is in two weeks, Peirsol said, referring to the world championships in Rome.         
	Lochte was under his world-record pace in the opening 50m before Peirsol took over for good. Peirsol dipped a full second under the mark after 150m while wearing an Arena X-Glide suit.         
	The last 50 really hurt, so I know the other two guys really, really hurt, he said, referring to Lochte and third-place finisher Tyler Clary.         
	Lochte took second in 1:54.21. He and Peirsol will swim the event in Rome.         
	Peirsol dominated the 200 back from the 2000 Sydney Olympics, when he finished second, until finally losing the race and his world record to Lochte at the 2007 worlds in Melbourne.Its been a few years since I really felt good racing, said Peirsol. He reclaimed his 100 back world mark with a time of 51.94 seconds on Wednesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dravid downplays loss in warm-up match
                                                     Dravid downplays loss in warm-up match
                  Rahul Dravid                     
	Potchefstroom: Indias shambolic performance in their only warm-up match ahead of the Champions Trophy is nothing to be concerned about, said senior batsman Rahul Dravid, insisting that the team would be alright once the main tournament gets underway.         
	Dravid said not much should be read into the teams crushing 103-run defeat at the hands of New Zealand in a warm-up game here Sunday. The Champions Trophy starts Tuesday. India play their opening match on Saturday against Pakistan.         
	We shouldnt read too much into it. When the main tournament begins, we would be alright, Dravid said after the match.         
	Neither the bowling nor the batting clicked for India in the practice match and the team seemed to be missing explosive opener Virender Sehwag, who has been crucial to the teams success while chasing big targets.         
	But Dravid was confident of a better show in the main tournament.         
	The veteran right-hander said his optimism stemmed from the fact that conditions at the actual venue of the tournament, the Wanderers and the Centurion, would be dramatically different from here.         
	The conditions in Johannesburg and Centurion would be different. This was a dry surface and it turned straightaway. Spinners bowled 30 overs (of the 50) and that doesnt happen often in these conditions, he said.         
	Indians will spend three days at this venue where practice facilities and actual wicket is not ideal, being too slow and dry, but Dravid chose to look at the situation philosophically.         
	These are not the best of facilities and it could have been better. But as international cricketers, we do not always get ideal conditions, he said.         
	Dravid himself was pleased with his 37-run knock in the practice match but wished he had carried on a bit longer.         
	It was a kind of wicket where if you get in, you need to make it count. I feel disappointed that I couldnt do it. But I feel good about my form, said Dravid.         
	The humiliating loss to New Zealand in their only warm-up game coupled with uncertainty over Gautam Gambhirs fitness has marred Indias build-up to the tournament.         
	After staying briefly on top of the ICC rankings and clinching the triangular series in Sri Lanka recently, the Indians were humbled by 103 runs by a side that had lost to a local team in their previous match.         
	Nobody has an answer if Gambhir, who missed Sundays warm-up tie at Potchefstroom, has really recovered from his groin strain.         
	It could well be a race against time for the left-hander. So would be the concern about the striking prowess of pace duo of Ishant Sharma and RP Singh, from whom the side would expect some timely breakthroughs during the tournament.         
	India would be expecting some big knocks from Sachin Tendulkar and Dravid.         
	Tendulkar is averaging just over 31 against South Africa in the one-dayers, from 52 games and has just three hundreds against the Proteas in their own backyard.         
	On the other hand, Dravid is averaging an impressive 44.74 in South Africa but is yet to hit a century. However, his average against South Africa is an eye-popping 51-plus in the latters den.         
	Suresh Raina and Yuvraj Singhs form will also be crucial to the side.         
	Raina looked good last night before being run-out and even got a nod from skipper Dhoni.         
	But Yuvraj, despite hitting one of the most sumptuous of sixes against spinner Daniel Vettori, appeared at sea against pacer Shane Bond.         
	The quicker pitches at the Centurion and the Wanderers would certainly keep these two young guns pre-occupied.           (AGENCIES)

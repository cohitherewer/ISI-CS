                                                   Roaring victory for Tiger
    - Jeev Milkha singh signs off with one-over 71 to finish tied 27th           Larry Dorman                                      Tiger Woods    
	Orlando: Tiger Woods returned to the top Sunday like some inexorable force, stalking with an almost frightening purposefulness to overtake Sean Hair and his five-stroke lead in the Arnold Palmer Invitational. As has become his custom, Woods delivered the stunning coup de grace with a flourish on Bay Hills 18th green, sinking a 15-foot putt in the heart of the hole as darkness fell.         
	[The 16th hole bogey snapped an incredible string of par shots as Indias Jeev Milkha Singh signed off with one-over 71 to finish tied 27th. Jeev parred each of his first 15 holes before the par-four 16th caught him off guard, costing him a stroke. Jeev parred the next two to settle for a round of 71 and his aggregate of four-over 284 earned him a share of the 27th place besides $44,400.]         
	Just as he did a year ago, and as he did in 2001 in his second of six victories in this tournament, Woods waited to erase doubts until every shot had been hit.         
	Then he stroked the winning putt. This time it was for a round of 67 and a five-under-par 275 total, one stroke better than Hair, who closed with a 73.         
	Woodss climb from five strokes back matched the largest comeback in his PGA Tour career. He also came back from five down at the 2000 Pebble Beach Pro-Am.         
	But there was no cap thrown to the ground in exultation, just a quick two-step to his left as the ball moved toward the hole, and a trademark fist-pump, like a hard right hook to the jaw to those who thought he could not win. Woods embraced his caddie, Steve Williams, and flashed a megawatt victory grin for the first time in a long time.         
	It feels good, it feels really good, said Woods, whose last victory was nine months, in a 19-hole playoff at the US Open, and one major knee operation ago.         
	It feels good to be back in contention again, to feel the rush and have to deal with everything coming down the stretch.         
	For Hair, who struggled with his driver most of the day, hitting just six of 14 fairways, it was like a punch to the stomach. Hair, a personable two-time winner on the tour, hung in until the end.         
	After losing the lead with a bogey at 16, Hair pulled even with a par to Woodss bogey at the 17th. But Woods was undeterred. Like flicking dust from his lapel, Woods dismissed the bogey, and after Hair missed a 38-footer for birdie at the 18th, he closed the deal.         
	The last three days, I hit the ball fantastic, Hair said. I think thats kind of the outcome of today was the ball-striking wasnt there.         
	The drama that played out at the Bay Hill Club and Lodge on Sunday was like something from two dreams  a sweet one for Woods and a nightmare for Hair. On the putting green before the round, the two laughed about Woodss two workouts before their tee time when Woods joked, I dont sleep.         
	Hair responded that sleeping was something he did best, except last night when I was thinking about playing you today.         
	It did not take Woods long to get serious. He quickly established that a five-stroke deficit was not insurmountable by going for the jugular early.         
	He birdied the second hole to close the gap to four strokes, and he birdied the third, hitting his wedge to six feet. Hair had trouble on No. 3, sending a pitch from 25 yards right of the green 12 feet past the hole. He missed the par putt and settled for bogey.         
	Missing greens and fairways, bereft of the ball-striking that had carried him to a five-stroke lead after three rounds, Hair suddenly found himself in Woodss world. In the caldron where throngs of people were screaming Woodss name and shouts of Hes baaaack! were heard across the course. The crowd was getting just what they had come to see  a Woods charge, and a tight race to the end.         
	Hair was not in a pleasant place. He bogeyed the seventh hole with a three-putt from 25 feet, and his lead was down to one. But he kept coming, birdieing the ninth to temporarily restore a two-stroke cushion.         
	Cutting Hairs lead to two at the turn had been Woodss goal from the start. It was exactly the position he had been in last year when he came back to win.         
	And when it came time to close it out, he got into the mind-set he needed, the feeling he had during every one of his previous 65 victories flooding back. At the par-3 14th, after finding his ball buried in a bunker for the second time, he blasted it out to 12 feet and threw his wedge at his golf bag. He was burning with a controlled anger, laser focused, and he rolled in the putt.         
	That putt, he said later, was the shot of the day for him. You just remember how to do it, he said. It hasnt been that long for me, but you just have that feel of what to do. And its a matter of getting it done.                 NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

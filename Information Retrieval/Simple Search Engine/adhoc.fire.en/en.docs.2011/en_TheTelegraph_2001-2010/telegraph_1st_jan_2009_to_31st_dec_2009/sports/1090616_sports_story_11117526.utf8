                                                   No decision
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Counil (ICC), at a meeting held at Lords on Monday, could not take a decision on where to hold the 2011 World Cup matches that have been taken out of Pakistan.               
	Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka accepted that if any of those 14 matches were to take place in their countries, they would not get any hosting fee.         
	However, it is understood that Pakistan would like Dubai and Abu Dhabi as the alternative venues for their share of matches.         
	The PCB agreed that any legal proceedings already launched against the ICC would remain on hold pending further discussions.

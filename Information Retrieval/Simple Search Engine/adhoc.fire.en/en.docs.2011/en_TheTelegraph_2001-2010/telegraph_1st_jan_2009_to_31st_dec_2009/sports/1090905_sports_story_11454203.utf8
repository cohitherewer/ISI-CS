The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Still feel quite frustrated, says Bhaichung Bhutia
                                                     Still feel quite frustrated, says Bhaichung Bhutia
    - India captain is peeved with dilly-dallying over his transfer           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Bhaichung Bhutia                                 
	Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutia finds himself in a bizarre situation. Hes eligible to lead India (and it was under his captaincy that we retained the Nehru Cup this week), but cant turn out for any club in the country!         
	Yes, thats how things stand Im afraid I cant wear the East Bengal colours till the Mohun Bagan issue, which has been hanging fire for almost three months, gets resolved, Bhaichung told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Friday, the day after the All India Football Federation (AIFF) appointed an arbitrator, legal eagle Amarendra Sharan, to break the impasse, Bhaichung said: I still feel quite frustrated First, the Indian Football Association (IFA) took weeks to decide that it couldnt take a decision         
	The matter got referred to the AIFF around July 9 and the arbitrators appointment came yesterday (Thursday) So, it took the AIFF almost two months to reach the same decision as the IFA Its reason enough to feel frustrated.         
	 Bagan, it may be recalled, suspended Bhaichung for six months on June 8, a move intended to hurt the India captain hard. Major differences with a key official, especially, led to the rather arbitrary punishment.         
	Look, if I have a problem with my driver, Ill sack him I wont stop paying him and, at the same time, bar him from seeking employment elsewhere How can something like that be done? Except one or two persons, I never had an issue with anybody in Bagan Its a club which has a rich history and I acknowledge that, Bhaichung, who promptly signed for arch-rivals East Bengal, pointed out.         
	His move to East Bengal, it seems, has led to a hardening of Bagans stand. Has probably made the club lobby harder, in the corridors that matter, too.         
	The way I see it, if you cant take a decision, then let that be known immediately Dont harm a players career The IFA could only meet on a particular date and it was the same with the AIFF The AIFF, in my view, is strong enough to take decisions. Instead, an arbitrator has been appointed Its because of such delays that some players are forced to compromise and sign one-sided contracts They give in to pressure.         
	We, at the Football Players Association of India (FPAI), have suggested to the AIFF that uniform contracts be introduced across India In fact, weve even sent a draft and said it should be circulated to the clubs, as they may have good suggestions So far, though, nothing has happened, Bhaichung, who is the FPAI president, lamented.         
	The contracts must give equal rights to both the players and the clubs If the contracts are one-sided, then do you think the players will actually give their 100 per cent? The days of die-hard loyalty to one club have gone Its disappointing, even sad, but thats the way it is Today, its all about money, because some officials have regularly broken the trust and problems have kept multiplying, he added.         
	Asked about the role being played by the FPAI, Bhaichung answered: Weve been guiding those whove approached us but, obviously, its not possible to get all details and guide every single player Uniform contracts would benefit everybody.         
	During the one-on-one, Bhaichung informed that the FPAI had taken the first step towards joining the 43-year-old Federation Internationale des Associations de Footballers Professionnels (Fifpro), which is headquartered in Holland, and also intends signing an MoU with the AIFF.         
	The Fifpro members have done just that with their national bodies, theyve signed MoUs, Bhaichung explained.         
	On a personal level, Bhaichung is awaiting a call from the arbitrator. If Im allowed to, Ill take a lawyer to the arbitration session Clearly, I want a quick settlement, he signed off.         
	Footnote: East Bengals shock defeat (and ouster from the IFA Shield) at the hands of TFA hasnt left Bhaichung despondent. Football can be a dodgy game Remember, as the reigning champions, Argentina lost (0-1) to Cameroon in the 1990 World Cup opener Such results happen and it doesnt mean that this East Bengal team isnt good

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wasim, Sanjay flay Dravid recall
                                                   Wasim, Sanjay flay Dravid recall
                      
	New Delhi: Indias bowling is their Achilless heel and recalling Rahul Dravid to prop up the batting order is a retrograde step, said former cricketers Wasim Akram and Sanjay Manjrekar at a promotional of ESPN STAR, ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy.         
	Both reckon that Zaheer Khans absence would render India a lesser force in the upcoming Champions Trophy and unless their batsmen step up to compensate with those extra runs, the team would be found wanting in South Africa.         
	Their bowling is their weakness. The batsmen made up with some extra runs in Sri Lanka and thats how they won the tri-series there. To win the Champions Trophy, the batsmen would have to do it again, said Manjrekar.         
	Akram said India would feel Zaheers absence even though he was expecting Ishant Sharma to do better in South Africas lively pitches.         
	Zaheers absence would affect Indias chances. At this level, experience does matter, Akram said.         
	These days, Ishant (Sharma) tends to go wide of the crease. His bowling coach should tell him to run straight and I think it would be okay with him, Akram advised.         
	Dwelling on the Indian team, both felt Dravids ODI return was a matter of temporary convenience and not any long-term plan.         
	Manjrekar went on to say that it was a step in the backward direction.         
	I dont see any long-term plan behind that. Its because India were knocked out of the World Twenty20, and the way they were knocked out, that prompted Dravids recall.         
	Our frontline batsmen got exposed in the tournament and thats how Dravid came into it. I think it was a backward step, said the former India player.         
	Akram said Dravids return would make sense only if he was in Indias 2011 World Cup scheme of things.         
	Dravid is one of the greatest players but he has not played ODI for two years and is now back. I think India should look ahead for the next World Cup and either keep Dravid as part of it or groom Rohit Sharmas and Suresh Rainas, the former Pakistan captain said.         
	Both Manjrekar and Akram felt by dropping Raina down the order and drafting in Dravid for the number three slot would dent the youngsters confidence.         
	Instead, they argued, Raina should be allowed to face the fire and come out unscathed to regain his self-belief.         
	Manjrekar said that he was also happy to see Sachin Tendulkar in vintage form but the former India batsman stands by the comments he made last year, calling the batting great an elephant in the dressing room after a lean patch.         
	That was a phase when he was too cautious and tension could be seen on his face. He was afraid of failure and getting out. That seems to have disappeared now and he is playing with more freedom, Manjrekar said.         
	I stand by the comment I made at that phase, he said.         
	But both Akram and Manjrekar warned the International Cricket Council against rushing with Tendulkars idea of splitting the 50-over format, saying such a far-reaching decision should not be taken in haste.         
	When asked about the implication of Andrew Flintoff rejecting a contract from his Board and turning freelancer, both agreed that more cricketers would follow him. (PTI)

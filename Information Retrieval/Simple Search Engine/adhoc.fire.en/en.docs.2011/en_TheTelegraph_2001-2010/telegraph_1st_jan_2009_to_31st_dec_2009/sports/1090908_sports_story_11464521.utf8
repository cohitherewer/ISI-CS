The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Filippov cuts Nigel short 
                                                     Filippov cuts Nigel short 
            BIPIN SHENOY            A sombre Surya Sekhar Ganguly at Gorky Sadan on Monday.   A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: The fourth Kolkata Open Grandmaster Chess tournament, with three rounds remaining, is poised for an exciting finish.         
	On a day of upsets, chess goddess Caissa smiled on 18-year-old GM Le Quang Liem of Vietnam who surged into sole lead with a fortunate victory over GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly from a clearly inferior position.         
	Le Quang now has six points and is followed by Sandipan Chanda, Viktor Laznikov and Anton Filippov on 5.5 points each.         
	The other shocker was English Grandmaster Nigel Shorts suicidal loss to Anton Filippov of Uzbekistan. Shorts choice of opening  the ultra sharp Evans Gambit  declared his intention of going all out for an attack.         
	Trying desperately to open lines against Filippovs castled king, Short burnt his bridges, sacrificing pawns, but Filippov put up a stubborn defence and launched a counter attack with his queen and rook after which Short resigned.         
	On the top board, GM Sandipan Chanda survived a scare against defending champion Viktor Laznica of Czech Republic and drew from a unmistakably inferior position by stalemating his opponent.         
	I mishandled the opening and my opponent obtained a definite positional advantage. I was lucky to wriggle out from that position he said later.         
	Top seeded Grandmaster Shakriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan played a sharp game to get the better of Indian GM Magesh Chandran from the white side of a Reti opening.         
	Sahaj Grover of Delhi drew yet another GM when he drew against G. N. Gopal from the black side of a Reti Opening in a marathon game which lasted 60 moves.         
	IM R.R.Laxman won against GM Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh in a long endgame and looks all set for his third and final GM norm out here. IMs B. Adhiban and S. Satyapragyan have excellent chances of getting their GM norms.         
	TOP BOARD RESULTS         
	GM Viktor Laznicka(5.5) drew with GM Sandipan Chanda (5.5); GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly(4.5) lost to GM Le Quang Liem(6); GM Nigel Short (4.5) lost to GM Anton Filippov(5.5); IM B.Adhiban (5) drew GM Parimarjan Negi(5); GM Mikheil Mchedlishvili (5) drew with GM Eltaj Safarli (5); GM Shakhriyar Mamedyarov(5) beat GM Magesh Chandran(4.5); GM Ni Hua (4) lost to GM Rustam Khusnutdinov(5); GM Enamul Hossain(4) lost to GM Evgeny Postny(5).

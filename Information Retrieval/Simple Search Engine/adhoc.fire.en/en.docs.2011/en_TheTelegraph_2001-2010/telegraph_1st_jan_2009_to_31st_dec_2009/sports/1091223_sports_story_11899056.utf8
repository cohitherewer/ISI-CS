            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Guwahati: Lajong FC were held to a 2-2 draw by Air India at the Nehru Stadium, here on Tuesday.         
	The Shillong outfit took the lead in as early as the sixth minute when Seikhohau Tubois gem of a shot didnt give Air India goalkeeper Kunal Sawant a chance to move.         
	AI slowly but steadily came back into the match and Lajong started showing signs of nervousness. Lajong custodian R Lalthuammawia had no business in handling the ball from a backpass and off the resultant free-kick Air India skipper Khelemba Meitei made it 1-1.         
	Four minutes into the second half Lajong were up once again. Tuboi was brought down innside the box and Daniel Bidemi gleefully converted the penalty to make 2-1.         
	But Lajongs joy was shortlived as Kailash Patil headed in a Yusuf Ibrahim cross to make it 2-2.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tait irked with CA decision
                                                   Tait irked with CA decision
                      
	Melbourne: Australian fast bowler Shaun Tait agreed to sacrifice the Indian Premier League (IPL) riches thinking of future rewards but after being denied a central contract by the Cricket Australia (CA), he now feels humiliated.         
	Tait believes that he was fit enough to play in the IPL for the Rajasthan Royals, but he was restricted by CA medical staff from doing so, thereby depriving him of $375,000.         
	He then suffered the blow of not having his central contract renewed, and was clearly annoyed to be told he was still in the scheme of things despite not being offered a contract.         
	I thought they (CA) had me in mind for future tournaments, so that was fair enough at the time. But to not let you go, then not pick you in the squad and then not give you a contract is a little bit of a kick in the teeth, Tait said.         
	However, Australias national selection panel chief Andrew Hilditch said Tait remained in CAs scheme of things and could be considered for the one-day series that follows the Ashes but the injury-prone fast bowler wasnt amused.         
	The pacer was furious on Hilditchs public pronouncement that he took the news well. Diggers (Hilditch) trying to sugar-coat that to be honest, he said.         
	Tait will go to England for a holiday before coming back to focus on the limited-overs format. (PTI)

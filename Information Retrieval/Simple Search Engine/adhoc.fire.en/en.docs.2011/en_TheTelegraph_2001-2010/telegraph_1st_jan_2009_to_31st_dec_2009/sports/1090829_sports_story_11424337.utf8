The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ECB under fire from players
                                                   ECB under fire from players
                      
	 London: The England and Wales Cricket Board on Friday came under attack from current and former players including Paul Collingwood and Geoff Miller, who criticised ECB for scrapping the 50-over format from its 2010 domestic calendar.         
	If we are not playing the 50-over game (at county level) it is going to be a hindrance, Collingwood said.         
	Miller said: If there is a global 50-over tournament and we have to participate in it, and if all we are playing is 40-over cricket then I have a problem with that.         
	Meanwhile, former Pakistan captain Zaheer Abbas said: If powerful Boards like India, Australia and South Africa push for more Twenty20 cricket, I fear it might be the end of ODIs in the next two years time.         
	Sree excels         
	 London: Team India discard Sreesanth put Warwickshire on a strong platform, capturing four Yorkshire wickets for 36 runs to reduce them to 100 for seven at close on the second day of their four-day match.         
	Brief scores         
	Warwickshire 320 (T. Ambrose 113; Kruis 3/68). Yorkshire 100/7 (Sreesanth 4/36). Match to continue.         
	Clarke wish         
	 Edinburgh: After resisting the Indian Premier Leagues lure in the first two editions, Australian vice-captain Michael Clarke on Friday said he wants to play in the 2010 chapter of the cash-awash event. The positive I see about the IPL is it leads into the Twenty20 World Championship, so its a very good preparation for all the guys playing in the IPL, he said.         
	Renovation         
	 Calcutta: The demolition work of blocks B, C, K and L at the Eden Gardens will begin within 10 days. The CAB stadium committee, which met on Friday, decided that the work will have to be completed within 75 days and it will cost the CAB Rs 69.75 lakh.         
	Butt trouble         
	 Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ejaz Butt has run into fresh trouble after the sports ministry sought a clarification from the Board for failing to keep its promise to lay international standard turf pitches in a renowned school in Colombo. Butt promised Sri Lankan foreign minister Rohitha Bogollagama to help in laying pitches at the school ground.         
	Pak-NZ series         
	 Karachi: Pakistan might end up playing their ODI series against New Zealand later this year in the United States or Malaysia if negotiations with cricket authorities in Abu Dhabi and Dubai fail. These are available options for us although our first preference is to have the series in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, a PCB official said.

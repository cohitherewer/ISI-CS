            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan will miss the services of Dipak Mondal in the I-League derby on October 25.         
	The defender, who was given marching orders following a double booking in their match against JCT, has been suspended for two matches. He missed Mondays match against Viva Kerala.         
	It was learnt that referee A. Rowan has castigated Dipak in his report, accusing the defender of pushing and hurling expletives at him. Mohun Bagan, however, have appealed against the decision to the All India Football Federation.         
	While Dipaks absence will mean redrawing plans for Karim Bencharifa, the coach was a relieved man after their first victory in the I-League on Monday. Its important to get some points before the Calcutta derby on October 25 especially considering the circumstances. Hope this is the start of the turnaround, said the Moroccan.         
	Edeh Chidis numerous misses on Monday has, no doubt, left the coach worried. Chidi is also human. The more goals you miss, the more it becomes a psychological thing  He needs a goal He is a quality player.

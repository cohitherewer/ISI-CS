                                                     McLaren crack the whip
    - Embarrassed F1 Team suspend long-time sporting director Dave Ryan             THE DAILY TELEGRAPH amp; AGENCIES              Lewis Hamilton in his McLaren-Mercedes                            
	An embarrassed McLaren suspended long-time sporting director Dave Ryan on Friday and ordered him home over the Lewis Hamilton controversy at the Australian Grand Prix.         
	Ryan represented McLaren along with Hamilton in the post-race stewards hearing in Melbourne that dealt with Jarno Trullis overtaking of the Briton under safety car conditions.         
	The incident earned the Italian a 25-second penalty, which saw him relegated to 12th, with Hamilton promoted onto the podium behind the Brawn 1-2 team of Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello.         
	But after a hastily arranged hearing in Malaysia on Thursday, the sports governing body ruled that the Briton and his team lied about the circumstances leading to Trullis penalty.         
	Trulli was reinstated and Hamilton disqualified.         
	Team principal Martin Whitmarsh said Ryan, who has been with McLaren for 35 years, had to take full responsibility. Hamilton, though loses face and points. It is a very sad day for the team as we have suspended our long-standing sporting director Dave Ryan, said Whitmarsh.         
	He has been with the team for 35 years. Ive known him personally for 20 years and anyone who knows him knows that he is a dedicated, straightforward, hard-working individual.         
	However, it has become clear during discussions with Davey (Dave) last night (Thursday) into this morning, that during the stewards meeting after the Australian Grand Prix, he was not entirely full and truthful in the answers that he gave to the stewards.         
	Consequently we have had no alternative today other than to suspend him.         
	Its something that the team and myself are deeply embarrassed about but also deeply regretful and I think for Davey, its been an extremely shattering day for him.         
	Whitmarsh sought to rationalise the decisions made by the 55-year-old New Zealand native. Anyone who knows Davey knows that he didnt set out with any deliberate intention to mislead, said the McLaren chief.         
	He went to the meeting with every intention of being clear and straightforward but during the course of that meeting  as we explored it more deeply in the last 24 hours  it was found that he was not as clear and comprehensive as he could have been.         
	Dave was the senior member of the team there and has to take full responsibility for leading that process.         
	Davey made a serious error of judgement going into that stewards meeting and he is paying the consequences for that. Thats something that he regrets and is something that Lewis, I and the rest of the team deeply regret and its something that we must put right.         
	While agreeing that Hamilton had not been entirely truthful himself during the hearing, Whitmarsh implied that the driver had followed the lead of Ryan in their meeting with the stewards.         
	I think that Lewis was not entirely truthful but we have spoken to Davey, who was the senior member of the team, and they went into a situation together and they were trying to deal with the situation and they got it wrong, he said.         
	Hamilton still faces the possibility of suspension or disqualification from the championship as a result of the incident. There is also the threat of further sanctions as the situation contravenes the International Sporting Code and the FIA have it within their power to pursue the matter further.         
	An FIA spokesperson confirmed: Given the seriousness of this matter, we cannot rule out further action at this stage.

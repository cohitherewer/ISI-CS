	Berlin: Three-time Olympic gold medallist Usain Bolt tried marijuana as a kid, according to a German newspaper.         
	Bolt, who set world records in the 100 and 200 metres at the Beijing Olympics and was part of the Jamaican team that broke the world mark in the 400-metre relay, made the admission in an interview published online Sunday.         
	In Jamaica, you learn as a child how to roll a joint. Everyone here has tried it. I did too  but I was real young then, Bolt was quoted as saying.         
	My family and my friends dont smoke and I dont hang out any longer with people who smoke.         
	The paper added that Bolt has been assigned two bodyguards by the Jamaican government.           (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Everton face tall order in United 
                                                   Everton face tall order in United 
                      
	London: Without a title since 1995, Everton now have the chance to reach their first FA Cup final since beating Manchester United 14 years ago after having long been in the shadow of the big four in English football.         
	Everton face the Red Devils again Sunday for the right to progress to the May 30 final at Wembley, with Champions League semi-finalists Chelsea or Arsenal as possible opposition. But first the Toffees have to get past the record 11-time FA Cup winners, who are top of the Premier League with an eye on winning five trophies in one season.         
	Manchester United are not only the top team in England but in Europe also, Everton midfielder Steven Pienaar said. But sometimes a side has a dip in form and in the last few games they have not done so well, but they can turn it around in a second. We just have to go out and play our own game and not worry about them.         
	United had defensive problems when central defenders Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic were out of the team through injury. But they returned for Wednesdays Champions League quarter final at FC Porto, which United won 1-0 through a spectacular long-range strike by Cristiano Ronaldo.         
	United have a wealth of attacking talent and manager Alex Ferguson has to decide which of his top strikers  Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez and Dimitar Berbatov  to leave on the bench. Federico Macheda, the 17-year-old Italian who has scored two match-winning goals as a substitute, is unlikely to start.         
	By contrast, Everton manager David Moyes has had striker problems all season, with Louis Saha, Ayegbeni Yakubu and James Vaughan out for long spells, and the manager has done well to lift the team into the top six.         
	Evertons central defenders Phil Jagielka and Joleon Lescott have been outstanding all season and have the ability to handle Uniteds star-studded strikeforce. Behind them, American goalkeeper Tim Howard hopes to shine against his former club. Moyes may go for Marouane Fellaini in attack with Tim Cahill as support, the Australian playing just behind the Belgian international.         
	Cahill has the experience of scoring in the FA Cup semi-finals and playing in the final, when he was in the 2004 Millwall team that beat Sunderland and then lost 3-0 to Manchester United.         
	I have been there before and it was an amazing experience and, hopefully, I can relive that experience again, quot; said Cahill, who believes United have rallied from their recent spell of poor form.         
	They have overcome a lot of their hiccups. Everyone says it is a good time to play them, but at any stage of the year they are a hard team to play against. Moyes is concerned that Mike Riley has been chosen as a replacement referee for the ill Steve Bennett after hearing suggestions in the media that Riley might be a United fan.         
	If you (the media) are saying that Mike Riley is a Manchester United supporter, you would hope the FA would look at that, the Everton manager said. (AP)

	Dhaka: Shakib-al Hasan hit an unbeaten 105 off 69 balls to lead Bangladesh to a seven-wicket victory over Zimbabwe in the second one-day International on Thursday.         
	Shakibs unbeaten century, his fourth in ODIs, helped the hosts level the five-match series 1-1. Left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak returned a career-best five for 29 as Bangladesh bowled out Zimbabwe for 219 in 47.2 overs.         
	Shakib shared 165 runs in an unbroken fourth wicket stand with Raqibul Hasan (39 not out) as the hosts stormed to victory in 29.3 overs, scoring 221 for three.         
	Hamilton Masakadza (34) and Justice Chibhabha (39) gave the tourists a blistering start with a 59-run stand off 10 overs before the Bangladeshi spinners applied the breaks.         
	Off spinners Naeem Islam and former captain Mohammed Ashraful claimed two each as the Zimbabwe batsmen struggled to find their comfort zone.         
	Malcolm Waller top-scored for the visitors with 40 while former captain Tatenda Taibu, who was dropped twice by Nazmul Hossain, added 38.         
	Bangladesh raced to 44 inside fours overs before Elton Chigumbura struck twice to halt their progress. Chigumbura finished with two for 47. The third match of the series will be held at the same Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Saturday.

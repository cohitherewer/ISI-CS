	Paris: Pete Sampras says Roger Federer already earned the title of best tennis player in history, even before winning the French Open.         
	Sampras said from Los Angeles that hes happy for Federer, who won his first championship at Roland Garros on Sunday. Its Federers 14th Grand Slam singles title, tying Sampras record.         
	Says Sampras: Im sure hes going to go on and win a lot more. Now that hes won in Paris, I think it just more solidifies his place in history as the greatest player that played the game, in my opinion.         
	Federers victim on Sunday, Robin Soderling, heaped praise on the Swiss maestro. Roger, really, congrats to you, Soderling said.         
	You really gave me a lesson in how to play tennis. And to me youre the greatest player in history. So you really deserved to win this title.           (AP)

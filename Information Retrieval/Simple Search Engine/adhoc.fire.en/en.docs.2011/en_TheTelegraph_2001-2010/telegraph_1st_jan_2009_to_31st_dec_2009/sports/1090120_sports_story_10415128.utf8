The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wasnt easy with Greg: Sehwag
                                                   Wasnt easy with Greg: Sehwag
                      
	New Delhi: Greg Chappell betrayed the trust of players but Gary Kirsten, his successor as India coach, is the best I have ever seen, Virender Sehwag said Monday.         
	Kirsten doesnt force things on you, Sehwag said.         
	Comparing the two coaches, Sehwag indicated that Chappell had tried to get him to change his batting style. He had his view on my front-foot play, my footwork.         
	The thing (Chappell) was that whatever you shared with him, it was promptly disclosed to the media and selectors. He hurt the trust. I wasnt comfortable with him, Sehwag said.         
	Sehwag was all praise for Kirsten. He is the best coach I have ever seen. His basic premise is: you all are international cricketers and you know how to succeed and how important it is to succeed. So I wont thrust anything on you. But whenever you need me, for practice, throwing balls, sharing ideas, worries, I am always there.         
	During Test matches, there are days when he doesnt force you to follow a similar routine in warm ups. If he senses a day when it can be an easy one for the lads, he allows you to do no warm ups. When an intense day is ahead, we all come together to bring that required intensity, Sehwag explained.         
	Sehwag was also praise for Sourav Ganguly, who got him to open the innings. Yes, it was in Sri Lanka. I hit gold in the third match with that blistering century off 69 balls (against New Zealand). A lot of youngsters, including me, came to the fore under Dada. Remember, when he took over world cricket was reeling under the impact of match-fixing. He always backed us.

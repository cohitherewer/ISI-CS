                                                   Bhatia chokes Chargers
                      
	Durban: Brilliant bowling by Rajat Bhatia towards the end helped the Delhi DareDevils snatch a 12-run victory against the Deccan Chargers in the Indian Premier League (IPL) here on Wednesday.         
	Bhatia (four for 15) with his medium pace first bowled Andrew Symonds (41), who was going great guns, and then uprooted Dwayne Smiths (1) stumps to bring the DareDevils back into the game after they looked down and out following Adam Gilchrists hurricane 33-ball 64.         
	With Wednesdays victory, the DareDevils cemented their place at the top of the table with 16 points. They almost assured themselves of a last-four berth with the eighth win from 10 matches.         
	It was a match that swung one way to the other after Delhi posted a competitive 173 for four following wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthiks breezy 44 and excellent batting by Tillekaratne Dilshan (37) and A.B. de Villiers (44).         
	Virender Sehwag (11) returned to the side to lead the DareDevils but fell cheaply, caught by Symonds off Chaminda Vaas.         
	In reply, Gilchrist made the most of two dropped chances to play a captains knock that saw balls flying over the ropes regularly.         
	Gilchrist, who was dropped by Amit Mishra and then by De Villiers, cut, drove and punched his way to 50 in just 24 balls.         
	However, just as in other matches in the tournament, the strategy break proved costly for the Chargers.         
	Left-arm pacer Pradeep Sangwan (three for 18), who had earlier accounted for T. Suman (3) and Rohit Sharma (6), came back to dislodge Gilchrists stumps. Gilchrists knock was studded with five fours and an equal numbers of sixes.         
	Symonds picked up from where Gilchrist left, hammering Mishra for two sixes. With the Australian all-rounder at the crease, the Chargers looked comfortably placed to win the match.         
	But Dirk Nannes removed Ravi Teja (27) and then Bhatia removed Symonds  he hit three fours and two sixes  and the Chargers batting crumbled. From 148 for three, the Chargers were all out for 161.         
	Earlier, a late charge from Karthik helped the DareDevils post a commanding 173.         
	Karthiks 23-ball unbeaten 44 had four boundaries and three sixes, including two over-boundaries off Chaminda Vaas in the last over that cost 23 runs.         
	He got good support from Dilshan and De Villiers, both of whom survived dropped chances.         
	Dilshan scored a quick-fire 18-ball 37 after he was dropped on eight by Sharma at slip. He hit seven fours and a six and clouted Shoaib Maqsusi for 24 runs in an over, including two paddle scoops over the wicketkeepers head.         
	De Villiers, who was dropped on seven, went on to compile 44 from 36 balls before being caught in the deep. The South African hit Dwayne Smith for two successive fours in the 17th over but fell trying one too many.

    - Former Commonwealth secretary general Ramphal named arbitrator           A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Chris Gayle (right) amp; Co. were sorely missed in the series against Bangladesh                                 
	Calcutta/Georgetown: Striking West Indies cricketers made themselves available for international duty on Tuesday after an arbitrator was appointed to mediate in the dispute with the national board.         
	The decision came two days after a weakened West Indies side lost both matches of a two-Test home series against Bangladesh. The members of the original 13-man squad for the series boycotted it and, witnessed their replacements lose both matches.         
	Also in an interview published on Tuesday, Trinidad and Tobago Cricket Board (TTCB) chief executive Forbes Persaud had said leading figures in the nations cricket body were considering breaking away from the West Indies team.         
	Trinidad and Tobago has been one of the traditional powerhouses of West Indian cricket along with Barbados and Jamaica. Cricket is the only sport in which the former British colonies still compete as one unit  all the Caribbean nations play soccer and compete in the Olympics independently.         
	But, despite the development, the West Indies are going with their weakened squad for the one-day Internationals against Bangladesh.         
	It was widely expected that players such as Chris Gayle, Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Dwayne Bravo would return for Sundays first one-dayer against Bangladesh.         
	The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) Wednesday posted on its website a squad list that featured none of the formerly striking players.         
	No explanation for the decision was given and the WICB was not immediately available for comment.         
	They (are) not picking us for the first two games; so I guess that sums up the situation, wrote Gayle, the pre-boycott captain of the team, on his Twitter feed.         
	They are the boss playing hard ball, he added.         
	The squad continues to be captained by the 36-year-old Barbadian Floyd Reifer with Darren Sammy as his deputy.         
	Former Commonwealth secretary general Shridath Ramphal was named arbitrator by the Caribbean trade bloc after it was asked by the West Indies Players Association (WIPA) and WICB to mediate in their dispute over pay, medical care and working conditions.         
	Guyana President and trade bloc chairman Bharrat Jagdeo said both sides agreed on Ramphal to immediately start, with help from the bloc secretariat in Guyana.         
	Both sides were conscious of the importance and urgency of resolving their differences and setting their relationship on a path of lasting co-operation, Jagdeo said in a statement.         
	Both parties have taken this step mindful of the responsibilities of both organisations to the people of the West Indies and to the international sport of cricket, and that all players will make themselves available for selection.         
	The latest move came hours after the board named a 14-man squad excluding the strikers for the first two of the three one-day Internationals against Bangladesh, on July 26 and 28.         
	WIPA asked Jagdeo to intervene, saying the senior players were angry with the board for allegedly not paying them for tours this year, neglecting to take care of injuries, and for forcing them to play a Test and one-day series in England in April without first consulting them.

                                                   Viru: Need to field better
    - Second test 
  - Twin centuries rescue NZ after early setback             A CORRESPONDENT                                  
	Napier: Stand-in captain Virender Sehwag said the McLean Park wicket is easy to bat on and hoped that Indian batsmen will also score big, after New Zealand reached 351 for four on the first day of the second Test here Thursday.         
	The hosts were reduced to 23 for three before Ross Taylor (151) and Jesse Ryder (137 not out) seized control with a 271-run fourth wicket partnership.         
	The Indian fielders dropped both of them early in their innings but Sehwag refused to blame the dropped chances for losing the initiative.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On leading the team         
	Its an honour to lead India. Everybody wants to lead. I am happy and am enjoying it.         
	When was the news (that he was to lead) broken to him?         
	Gary spoke to me yesterday (Wednesday) and told me that Dhoni may not be fit for Thursday. But he said that the management would decide before the match.         
	On Dhonis injury         
	I think he has some back problem. Hes got a back spasm. He went for an MRI scan I think he is okay now.         
	If it was a tough day on the field         
	Yes. It is a good track to bat on and there is nothing for the bowlers. So hopefully we will do well when we bat.         
	If fielding let the team down         
	I dont think so. Sometimes we take catches, sometimes we drop them; it happens in Test matches. But we have to improve our fielding, especially our catching.         
	On the bowling         
	It was a tough day for the bowlers. It is not easy to bowl one line or length because the ball is coming on to the bat and, with a fast outfield, if batsmen play their shots and the ball goes in the gap, it is very difficult to set a field. Taylor and Ryder played really well. The way they were batting, it wasnt easy to stop them from scoring. Harbhajan really bowled well but there is nothing for the quick bowlers.         
	There is just bounce and if someone is set, it becomes an advantage. With the bounce, you can play your shots. Had we taken the catches, we could have seven or eight wickets. But it happens in cricket. Some days you catch everything, some days you drop everything.         
	On Ryders innings         
	One good thing about him was that he was playing his shots. So it is very difficult to stop him. If someone is playing his shots, it is very difficult to set the field and stop the runs.         
	Will the ball turn from the third or fourth day?         
	We are hoping for that. But there is good bounce on this wicket.         
	On McLean Park         
	Its a small ground. The square boundaries are very short. It is very difficult to contain the batsmen on such grounds.

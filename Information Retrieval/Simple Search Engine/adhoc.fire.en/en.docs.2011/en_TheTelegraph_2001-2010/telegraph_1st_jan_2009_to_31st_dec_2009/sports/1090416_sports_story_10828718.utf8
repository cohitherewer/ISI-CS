The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kaif finds no place in Royals team
                                                   Kaif finds no place in Royals team
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta: Former India Test player Mohammed Kaif along with six others players have been left out of the Rajasthan Royals final squad for the second edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) starting on Saturday.         
	Kaif, however, may return if there are injuries to other members of the squad.         
	The defending champions will play Royal Challengers Bangalore in the opening match at Cape Town.         
	The 28-year old who played all the 16 matches in the first edition of the IPL was the most expensive buy of the Jaipur-based franchisee.         
	The other six players are Dinesh Salunkhe, Paras Dogra, Anup Revandkar, Srideep Mangela, Ashraf Makda and Azhar Malik. All of them will fly back to India.         
	It has always been a target to pick a final squad of 17-18 players, and this year we have an even stronger squad than last year, Manoj Badale, the owner of the franchise said.         
	It is disappointing to have to let go of any players, as they are all stars in our view. Much of the attention will focus on Mohammed Kaif, who has been a key part of our success to date  not just as a batsman, but as a role model for our younger Indian players. He has been extremely supportive of the decision, which says a lot about him as a person. Injuries and new conditions mean that the players participation later in the tournament is not ruled out.

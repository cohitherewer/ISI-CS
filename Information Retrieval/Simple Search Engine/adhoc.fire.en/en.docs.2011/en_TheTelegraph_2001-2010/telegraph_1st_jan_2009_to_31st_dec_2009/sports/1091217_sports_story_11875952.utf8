            OUR CORRESPONDENT AGENCIES      RANJI ROUND UP            Rohit Sharma celebrates his triple century in Mumbai on Wednesday. (PTI)                           
	Mumbai: Rohit Sharma proved a point on Wednesday when he struck an unbeaten triple century that put hosts Mumbai in the box seat against Gujarat in the Ranji Trophy Super League tie at the Brabourne Stadium.         
	Rohit, resuming on overnight 145, notched up an unbeaten 309 before Mumbai declared at 640 for six in their first innings.         
	At close on the second day, the visitors were 120 for one.         
	Everybody used to say that I am a limited overs batsman. But with this knock, I have shown that I can also play the longer version of the game, Rohit said after his maiden triple in first-class cricket.         
	I was not concerned about the score. Everything was going well for me from the moment I struck the first ball of the day to the boundary. I told myself that if they bowled a negative line, I would keep taking singles and thats what I did, said Rohit who hit 18 fours and a six on Wednesday.

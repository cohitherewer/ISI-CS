	Cape Town: In Khayelitsha, the largest township in South Africa, 80 per cent of the people are unemployed, a third are HIV positive and one  some say two  million live in cramped impoverishment. But it has its own field of dreams, as David Beckham saw.         
	He was championing a Football Association-backed project, Coaching for Hope, to talk about Englands aim of hosting the 2018 World Cup finals, but also to share some of his thoughts  on the role he plays, on the death of his grandfather the day before, and what it is like to appear at such a place.         
	I was brought up in the east end of London, Beckham said, before checking himself slightly. Poor as some of that area once was, it is not remotely on the scale of what he was now witnessing.         
	Ive been gifted in many of the things that Ive been able to have in my life, and many people take things for granted. You can talk about these townships and you can talk about different parts of the world that have poverty, but nothing prepares you and nothing makes you realise what its actually like for the families and for kids until you visit these places.         
	Going to Sierra Leone a year and a half ago was one of the most rewarding things that Ive done. As much as the poverty is horrendous there, you saw the positives. Then you come to somewhere like this and this plastic pitch just appears in the middle of nowhere in the township which obviously has this poverty.         
	The plastic pitch he was standing on is an extraordinary place. Built a year ago at a cost of 3m rand (250,000), it is a floodlit oasis that has quickly become a cherished landmark. It is unique, though there are plans to build others, and so popular that in one day recently, 1,500 children played on it, next to the Ikuhusi PP primary school, which has so many pupils that they attend in shifts.         
	On Friday and Saturday nights, there is a midnight football league of local teams, many involving youths and young men more often found mired in drugs, alcohol and violence. The gang-like teams must adhere to strict rules  if they try to smoke on the premises, their team are deducted five points. There is barbed wire on the fences but no damage has been done inside.         
	The floodlights are a beacon in an area so bewilderingly, crushingly uniform, divided as it is into areas known by blocks and letters rather than street names and where shops and salons are made from ship containers so they cannot be torched.         
	The strength of these people and the strength around these townships is something special, Beckham said. It could have sounded condescending coming from a multi-millionaire icon, who flies in and out in opulence and stays in six-star hotels, but the 34 year-old has a quality that does not make this sound trite.         
	He is convincing, always replying politely and diligently. Just watching these kids play football, its just like watching my boys play. That passion, that fun and just having a football and playing, he said, having spent time chatting and being photographed with the children.         
	I love being a part of these events, Beckham said, admitting that he also had to keep his feelings in check. Im an emotional person.         
	His visit to Khayelitsha came a day after arriving in South Africa to help promote Englands 2018 bid and take a role in Fridays World Cup draw, only to hear that his maternal grandfather, Joseph West, had died.         
	I was so close to my grandad, Beckham said. To be here, its something that my grandad was proud of me being a part of. He was so proud of everything in my career and he followed every game. He would call me after every game, every training session. If I had decided to go home [back to England], I know what he was like  hes an East End strong person  and I know what he would have said.

	Mumbai: Sania Mirza will begin her clay court campaign this season by trying to qualify for the Madrid Open womens tennis event later this week, allaying concerns over her fitness after she pulled out of an European tournament at the last minute.         
	The 22-year-old from Hyderabad had entered a $100,000 International Tennis Federation (ITF) event in Bucharest, Romania, which began on Monday. However, she withdrew before the qualifying sign-in deadline on Friday. It would have been the first Challenger level event for Sania since the 2004 season.         
	Her father, Imran, clarified that there were no major concerns behind the late withdrawal, confirming that the rest of Sanias clay court schedule was on track.She had developed high fever but has recovered and will leave for Madrid late on Tuesday, Imran said.         
	After Madrid Open, Sania will aim to qualify for the $220,000 Strasbourg Open. She will then play the French Open where she has a direct entry.

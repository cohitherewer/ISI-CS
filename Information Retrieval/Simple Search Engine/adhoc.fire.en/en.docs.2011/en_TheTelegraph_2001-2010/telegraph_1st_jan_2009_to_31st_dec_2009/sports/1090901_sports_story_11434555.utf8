The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL committee to discuss IMG issue
                                                   IPL committee to discuss IMG issue
                      
	New Delhi: Amid speculation of a rift in the top brass of the BCCI, the Indian Premier League (IPL)s governing council will meet in Mumbai on Wednesday to draw up a future course of action following the BCCIs abrupt termination of its contract with the event management company IMG.         
	With as many as four top franchises protesting the decision, the governing council is expected to discuss the legal implication of the development and also explore possibilities of conducting the third edition of IPL on its own.         
	Apart from IPL commissioner and chairman Lalit Modi, the meeting will be attended by BCCI president Shashank Manohar, secretary N. Srinivasan and senior officials Arun Jaitley, Rajiv Shukla, Niranjan Shah and I.S. Bindra.         
	The BCCI had decided to snap ties with IMG after the working committee refused to approve the terms of the contract.         
	The development is being interpreted as an attempt to clip Modis wings who was largely instrumental in roping in the services of IMG for the first two editions of the cash-rich event.         
	BCCI secretary Srinivasan, who negotiated the agreement with IMG, conveyed the boards decision to the company in a letter.         
	Srinivasan said in the letter that BCCI primarily engaged the company for the first edition of the IPL for an amount of Rs 42.92 crore after which the boards working committee refused to approve the terms and conditions of the contract.         
	The letter said the working committee felt that IMGs fee was disproportionate to the services rendered.         
	Srinivasan claimed in the letter that he and Manohar, the BCCI president, had met the IMG bosses in London in June for negotiations on the issue and had asked them to submit a fresh fee proposal before the next working committee on August 13. IMG failed to do so and the BCCI said the deal was over.         
	Srinivasan and IMG refused comment on the issue.         
	The IPL franchises were informed about the decision only on Saturday morning through a separate email sent by league officials, a franchise official confirmed.         
	Sources in the IPL governing council said they expected IMG to drag the Indian board to court over the issue, but the latest development is on expected lines as the payment to the sports management firm was a matter of debate within the BCCI last year too.         
	One section of officials claimed that the fee was exorbitant and argued that IMGs role was over once the tournament was launched.         
	The four IPL franchises  Delhi DareDevils, Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals  have separately written to the BCCI, resenting the termination of IMGs contract.

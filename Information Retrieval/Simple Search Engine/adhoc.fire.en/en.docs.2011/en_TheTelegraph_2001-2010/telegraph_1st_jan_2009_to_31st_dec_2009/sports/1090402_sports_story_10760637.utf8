The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United SC earn a point
                                                   United SC earn a point
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: United SC failed to get the better of an off-colour and weary Mumbai FC as they played out a goalless draw in their penultimate match of the I-League at the Cooperage here on Wednesday.         
	The single point from the match nudged their tally to 23 but the fate of the Calcutta club in the elite division hangs in balance.         
	On Wednesday Subrata Bhattacharjees men lacked the teeth. Despite enjoying better ball possession in the second half, United failed to create any cohesive moves to find the target. The hosts were reduced to 10 men after the 78th minute with key player Kulothungan picking up his second yellow card, but even then United could not threaten the Mumbai FC defence.         
	Bhattacharjee admitted that his teams striking prowess was very poor.         
	Our team could have played much better, but they were under pressure. Thats why they couldnt. There was not much of constructive game, he said.         
	Teams         
	Mumbai FC: Lihas Koya, Anas Edathodika, Selwyn Fernandes, Abhishek Yadav (Alex Ambrose 63), Felix Aboagye (Kutty Mani 65), Abel Hammond, K Kulothungan, Sanjay Parte, Riston Rodrigues, Anees Kutty (Subhas Chakraborty 64), Kamaljeet Kumar.

	Referee: A Rowan         
	Man of the Match: Anas Edathodika.

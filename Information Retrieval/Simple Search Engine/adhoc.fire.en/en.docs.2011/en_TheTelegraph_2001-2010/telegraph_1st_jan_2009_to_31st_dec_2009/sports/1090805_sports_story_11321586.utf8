The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mixed reactions to the BCCIs stand
                                                   Mixed reactions to the BCCIs stand
                                      Sania and Mahesh      
	New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)s decision to reject the controversial whereabouts clause of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) has evoked mixed reaction from former Test cricketers.         
	Sandeep Patil and Ajit Wadekar backed the BCCI while Chandu Borde found merit in the Wada code.         
	Former India captai Wadekar said there should be different dope-testing norms for cricket which is unlike games like hockey, which were shorter in duration.         
	Here Im talking about Test cricket which is different from short-duration games like hockey. There should be different testing norms for cricket which cant be clubbed with other sports, Wadekar said.         
	He also felt that the International Cricket Council (ICC) could have had a discussion with the various boards and players on this issue instead of allowing it to fester.         
	ICC could have discussed this with the other boards and the players. Then they could have sorted this out earlier, Wadekar said.         
	If Im in the boots of Yuvraj Singh or (MS) Dhoni I would certainly not like to be disturbed when Im on a holiday. Like every individual, the cricketers too need to have their privacy respected, Patil said.         
	Former India captain Borde, however, said: It seems both have valid arguments to support their respective views. It is advisable for the anti-doping authorities to talk to the cricketers and remove whatever apprehensions they are having. They need to be convinced Its for the betterment of the game.         
	However, Indias star tennis players and sports medicine experts differed with the cricketers and said there could not be separate rules for them.         
	While sports medicine experts termed the objection as silly and absurd, Indias leading tennis players Mahesh Bhupathi and Sania Mirza sought to dispel their apprehensions and asked them to sign the document.         
	Bhupathi and Sania stressed on the point that the Wada initiative was about weeding out drug cheats from the world of sports and both felt it was the duty of every sportsperson to co-operate and contribute to create a dope-free world.         
	I have been doing the whereabouts this entire year. I think if the system allows for those who abuse it to be caught we should go with it, Bhupathi said.         
	Lots of tennis players had apprehensions early on but we are all doing it, Bhupathi said.         
	Echoing his view, Sania Mirza said rules should be same for everyone.         
	It would not be fair to all the other sports and sportsmen of the world to make exceptions to Wadas rules and Im sure any doubts that the cricketers have can be sorted out amicably through consensus before they sign on the dotted line, Sania said.         
	Reminding that every sportsperson has a duty to support the anti-doping agency in its bid for a dope-free world, Sania said: We all share the same goals as Wada, being a part of the world sports fraternity.         
	The Indian cricketers on Sunday refused to sign the clause claiming it infringes on their privacy and puts their security at risk. (PTI)

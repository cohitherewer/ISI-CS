                                                   Uphill task for NZ
                      
	Galle: Tillekaratne Dilshan scored a century as Sri Lanka set New Zealand an improbable 413-run target on the fourth day of the first Test on Friday.         
	Beginning their run chase, makeshift opener Daniel Flynn  standing in for Tim McIntosh, one of seven players hit by a stomach bug  was dismissed for nought in a short evening session to leave the tourists on 30 for one at stumps.         
	Dilshan has revelled in his new role as opener on his return to cricket after injury, scoring 92 the in first innings and then an entertaining 123 from 131 balls with 12 boundaries and a six.         
	Sri Lanka powered their way to 259 for four from just 49 overs.

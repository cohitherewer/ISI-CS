            A STAFF REPORTER            Peter Siddle                           
	Calcutta: Opener Phillip Hughes has returned to the Australian Test squad. He was named in the 13-man squad Monday, for the Boxing Day Test against Pakistan to be held in Melbourne.         
	Pacer Peter Siddle, who was out with injury, has also made a return. However, Ben Hilfenhaus is still not fit and will not play any part in the first Test against Pakistan, according to a Cricket Australia release.         
	Andrew Hilditch, chairman of the national selection panel, said: While Ricky Ponting is expected to be fit for the Test, the NSP has picked a squad of 13 players for the match, so that theres adequate cover in the event Ponting does not recover as quickly as is hoped.         
	The NSP has taken the opportunity of including Hughes in the squad, given his exciting debut at international level against South Africa, his recent form in Weet-Bix Sheffield Shield cricket and our view that he will be an important player for Australia moving forward.         
	Peter has recovered from injury and returns to the Australian squad. He will play in the Ford Ranger Cup match on Wednesday for Victoria, Hilditch added.         
	The squad         
	Ricky Ponting (captain). Michael Clarke (vice-captain), Doug Bollinger, Brad Haddin (wicket-keeper), Nathan Hauritz, Phillip Hughes, Mike Hussey, Mitchell Johnson, Simon Katich, Clint McKay, Marcus North, Peter Siddle, Shane Watson.

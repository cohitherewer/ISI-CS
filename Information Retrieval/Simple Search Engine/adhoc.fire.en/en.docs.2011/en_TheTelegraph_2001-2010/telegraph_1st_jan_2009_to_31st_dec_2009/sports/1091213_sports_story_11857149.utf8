	Calcutta: A ragtag East Bengal were good enough to hold Chirag United goalless in a CFL Premier Division match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. The red and gold brigade, who decided to play the match at 11.45 am and had only five players on the bench, should be lauded for showing enough guts and character on the day.         
	Chirag, sensing that their rivals were not in the best of health, were fancying their chances but they never expected the likes of Priyant Singh, Mumtaz Akhtar, Soumik Dey or Mehtab Hossain would put up such a dogged performance.         
	If under-19 player and man of the match Priyant made some outstanding saves under the bar, then Soumik, making a comeback after two months of injury lay-off, played a solid game as a sweeper.         
	Mehtab, who survived a desperate lunge from Parveen Kumar midway through the first half, played through the pain. The hero of the day was undoubtedly Priyant.         
	The goalkeeper got the start only because coach Phillipe de Ridder did not have any under-19 player to fill the slot. And boy! What a match this youngster played. Of all the saves, one that stood out came in the 69th minute.         
	A Basudeb Mondal free-kick saw Eduardo Chacon slipping in from the blind side. Priyant dived to his left and saved the header.         
	Eduardo then hit a volley off the rebound ,and this time Priyant dived to his right and fisted the ball, which landed just outside the six-yard box. This time Gouranga Biswas tried with a drop shot but the goalkeeper was again equal to the task and palmed it away for a corner.         
	Chirag had another chance in the dying minutes when Basudeb free kick found Denson Devadas and his header was perilously close to the target.         
	Edurado once again was following the ball but before he could reach Harmanjyot Khabra came from nowhere and headed it out. East Bengal came close once when Alvito DCunha got past Eduardo on the left and sent a low cross for Poibang Poshna who held onto the ball a trifle long and was easily closed down by the rival defenders.         
	Lastly something about the poor refereeing. Tushar Kanti Guha was a complete embarrassment on the day and the Indian Football Federation, along with Calcutta Referees Association, should do something about assigning inept referees for matches like this.         
	Parveen Kumar had no business in staying on the field after that inhuman challenge on Mehtab and surprisingly the referee did not even flash a yellow card!

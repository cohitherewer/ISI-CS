The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies keep Indians off peak
                                                                                                                                   Aussies keep Indians off peak
    - Fourth ODI Sachin falls seven short of 17,000 mark             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  
	Chandigarh: Pulled down by umpire Asoka de Silva, Sachin Tendulkar failed to climb a peak in Mohali, on Monday. Australia, on the other hand, ensured that they werent left with having a mountain to climb.         
	The fourth ODI saw the visitors win by 24 runs, a result which took the Hero Honda Cup scoreline to 2-2. Another loss and they wouldve faced the Everest.         
	That apart, a defeat wouldve given the No.1 ranking back to India. For now, the Australians dont have to head for the nearest oxygen parlour.         
	In fact, their strong comeback may just do wonders in the remainder of the seven-match series.         
	Actually, Ricky Ponting began on the wrong foot, losing the toss to Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Then, four run outs didnt exactly help and 250 was managed in 49.2 overs, a good 25-30 runs short of a dominating total.         
	However, that proved to be match-winning, even though the ball was often almost impossible to grip when the hosts set out to bat under the lights.         
	The failure of Sachin and Virender Sehwag, yet again, to script a solid start made it easier for Ponting and his men. A best of 40 (on Monday) in four ODIs is, well, poor.         
	Yes, Sachin hasnt been dominating us, but as long as hes in, India would fancy their chances... Weve kept Sachin in check, not allowed him to play extravagant shots, is how Ponting put it.         
	Sachin, for the record, is now seven short of the 17,000-mark.         
	Instead of Australia slipping on the dew, the Indians got it all wrong, when a treating-the-ball-on-merit approach wouldve been enough.         
	One did, at times, get the impression that Dhoni and Co. were a tad complacent. Thats disastrous when the opponent happens to be the World Cup holders.         
	Towards the end, Harbhajan Singh and Praveen Kumar did try to repeat their splendid (albeit futile) Vadodara effort, but their partnership ended when Harbhajans balle-balle show got over on 31  204 for eight.         
	Its a good win, particularly as wed scored 30-40 short... After the first few overs, our bowling had been excellent, defending a smallish total... With all the troubles, our teams balance isnt perfect, but we can pick ourselves up when people think were down, remarked Ponting.         
	MoM Shane Watson (49 and three for 29) was spot on when he said: We were good enough to get wickets at important times... Id say its a great win for us...         
	Dhoni pointed out that his bowlers (save Ishant Sharma, who was taken to the cleaners) did a superb job in restricting Australia, but the batting failed as a unit.         
	Clearly, it did.         
	Its not a real setback... Its difficult to say what exactly was the turning point... We had a good start, but kept losing wickets and failed to take advantage of that... We shouldve been able to chase, Dhoni maintained.         
	He was, of course, mighty pleased with the fielding. One wont always get run outs, but the fielding today was very good... Well have to continue with this effort...         
	Asked if he was disappointed by the failure of Suresh Raina, Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja to take the team over the finish-line, Dhoni replied: Not really... Its a cruel game and the players need to grab opportunities...         
	Understandably, Dhoni steered clear of the controversy surrounding Sachins dismissal off Nathan Hauritz. Its a part and parcel of the game... I didnt see the hawk-eye replay, was his answer on being asked whether hed been disappointed with the decision.         
	Among others, the match was watched by Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ijaz Butt. I hope to see a fine contest, hed told The Telegraph, in the morning.         
	It wasnt quite that.         
	Footnote: The constant movement behind the sightscreen at the pavilion end came in for much criticism, and rightly so, from both captains. It probably distracted Yuvraj Singh to the extent that he was run out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cyclone Sehwag lashes Lanka

	Mumbai: The Cricket Club of India track was supposed to play true, somebody just forgot to tell Virender Sehwag.         
	The Nawab of Najafgarh cracked the second fastest double hundred ever to put India in box seat in the third and final Test of the Jaypee Cup against Sri Lanka.         
	At the end of the second days play, India were 443 for one with Sehwag unbeaten on 284 and Rahul Dravid batting on 62.         
	Earlier in the day, Sri Lankas first innings closed at 393.         
	It was Sehwags sixth double century, the most by an Indian batsman. Sixteen runs more on the morrow would put him on a higher pedestal, even above Sir Don Bradman and Brian Lara, as he would become the only player ever to have scored three triple centuries. Apart from Sehwag, Bradman and Lara each have two triple hundreds under their belt.         
	With Murali Vijay (87) making sure that the absence of Gautam Gambhir was not felt, Sehwag had the license to thrill the spectators and, in the process, make the contest look like a one-sided affair.         
	Sehwag went about his task in a nonchalant yet ruthless manner. As long as Vijay was giving him company, Sehwag seemed to be content with cruising at run-a-ball rate. However, once the Tamil Nadu batsman departed in the post-lunch session, he quickly changed gears.         
	The spinners bore the brunt of his broad blade, as Sehwag struck five of his seven sixes off Muttiah Muralidharan and Rangana Herath.         
	When Sehwag moved on to 48, brought up with a six off Ranagana Herath, he reached the 6000-run mark in Tests. By the time he reached the three-figure mark, from 101 balls, he had struck 13 fours and three sixes.         
	Vijay proved that he has come a long way since his debut Test, against Australia at Nagpur a year ago. If his drives bore class, his repeated stepping out to spinners was a testimony of his confident approach.         
	Pity then that a rare mistake in shot selection, when he tried to sweep one off Herath, denied him a well deserved century. Vijays opening stand with Sehwag was worth 221 runs.         
	Then, Sehwag went berserk. He got to the 200-run mark, with a superb on-drive off Nuwan Kulasekara, from only 168 balls. Nathan Astle of New Zealand holds the record for the fastest double hundred, which came off 153 balls against England at Christchurch in 2001-02.         
	With 470 runs scored in the day, the Lankans must have been left wondering what conspired the 22-yard strip at the Brabourne to behave like the one at Motera, overnight. Suddenly all the zing seemed to have vanished from the pitch and they were in for a leather hunt under the sun.         
	But they had only themselves to blame. The spinners and the seamers were listless and kept feeding the Indian batsmen with loose deliveries.         
	In the process, Muralidharans hope of bidding adieu, in his last overseas Test, in style took a severe beating. He went for nearly six runs per over, conceding 119 from 20 overs without picking up a wicket.

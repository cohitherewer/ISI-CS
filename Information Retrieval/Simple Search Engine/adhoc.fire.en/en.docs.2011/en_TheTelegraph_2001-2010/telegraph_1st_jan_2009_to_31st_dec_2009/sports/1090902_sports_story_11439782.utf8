The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pakistan split camp
                                                     Pakistan split camp
          
	Karachi: The Pakistan team management on Tuesday decided to split the Champions Trophy preparatory camp into two parts with coach Intikhab Alam laying stress on having more flexibility in the team.         
	This comes amid reports that Intikhab and Miandad disagreed on the methods of preparation for the Champions Trophy.         
	Miandad wanted the batsmen to be prepared for bouncers and seaming balls in South Africa, the venue of the tournament and so had ordered the pitch to be made accordingly.         
	But Intikhab said that he would like to see the national team players practice on all type of pitches in the conditioning camp and he would like to see sporting tracks which encourage bowlers and batsmen.         
	Initially, it was announced that the players would attend a 10-day conditioning camp in Lahore, for which the newly appointed batting consultant Miandad had also prepared special grassy pitches for the batsmen in Lahore.         
	But on Tuesday, Intikhab said the players would first attend a conditioning camp in Lahore from September 1 to 6 in which they will only have physical training and counselling sessions with psychologist Maqbool Babri, who also worked with them before the World Twenty20 in England.         
	The second part of the preparations would be a training camp in Karachi from September 12 to 16 in which the players will work with Miandad and other specialist coaches nominated by the Pakistan Cricket Board.         
	Intikhab, a former Test captain, said he was trying to introduce a policy of flexibility in the team under which players can be asked to bat at any position and team combinations changed according to situational requirements.         
	We must not be rigid in our approach. We have the talent to be flexible and that is the main requirement of limited over cricket these days, Intikhab said.         
	The Pakistan coach said only one specialist opener was picked in the squad because of this flexible approach.Intikhab also made it clear that he was counting on experienced batsman Mohammed Yousuf to provide stability in the middle order.         
	He is a very good player and the batting should revolve around him in South Africa.         
	Intikhab said he saw bowling as Pakistans main strength in the Champions Trophy, with an excellent pace attack and two quality spinners in Saeed Ajmal and Shahid Afridi.         
	We now also have Mohammed Asif in the team and he is a top notch performer. He is coming back after a long time and he will take time to settle down but we still have plenty of bowling options, he said.         
	Pakistan will leave for South Africa on September 17 and Intikhab said they would play a couple of warm up matches before the competition.         
	The warm up matches we played against India and South Africa in the World Twenty20 helped us a lot in adjusting to English conditions. The warm up games will play a similar role for us in Champions Trophy, he added.

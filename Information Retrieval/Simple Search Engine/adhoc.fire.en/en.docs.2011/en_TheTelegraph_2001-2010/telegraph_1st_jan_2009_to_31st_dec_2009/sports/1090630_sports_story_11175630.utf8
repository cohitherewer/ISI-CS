                                                     Manoj signs for Kalighat
            A STAFF REPORTER            Kalighat captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla with Manoj Tiwary at the Kalighat Club on Monday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Manoj Tiwary has left Mohun Bagan for Kalighat, signing a one-year contract with the club Monday. This means Manoj will play alongside Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla for the first time in club cricket.         
	This is Manojs second stint with the club.         
	Look, from childhood I dreamt of playing for major clubs in the city. I had a better offer from Kalighat so I decided to move on. I realised that Kalighat will be a good club to play this season, Manoj said, minutes after signing the contract at the Kalighat club tent. The signing lays to rest rumours that East Bengal are all set to snap up Manoj for the next season.         
	Asked whether the tiff with Bagan coach Abdul Munayem forced him to take the decision, the 23-year old Bengal batting mainstay said: No, thats not the case I had a good time with Bagan. They supported me throughout my stint there. But I felt Kalighat have good players and playing here would help me.         
	Talking about playing with Shukla, Manoj said that it would be of immense help in building up a good understanding between the duo.         
	He is like my elder brother There was never any problem between us That was the wrong news circulated in the media He is a nice player and this will help us improve our mutual understanding, Manoj said.         
	Manoj, however, rubbished reports about him leaving Bengal for another state to enhance his chances for a Team India comeback.         
	Look, this is all nonsense I played for Bengal last season when we were reeling in the plate division Now when we have been promoted to the Elite division why would I leave Bengal I will never leave Bengal and I know that from here I will make my way to the Indian team again, he said.         
	Meanwhile, it was learnt that former Bengal captain Deep Dasgupta, who has left the Indian Cricket League (ICL), was all set to join Kalighat.

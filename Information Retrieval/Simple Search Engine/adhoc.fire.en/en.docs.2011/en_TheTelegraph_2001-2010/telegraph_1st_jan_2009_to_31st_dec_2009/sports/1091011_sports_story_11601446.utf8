            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Around 50,000 seats will be available for the public when Eden Gardens hosts the one-dayer against Sri Lanka in December.         
	This is because of the renovation that is already in progress in four blocks of the stadium for the 2011 World Cup.         
	Even the electronic scoreboard has been dismantled. The Eden has a seating capacity of 90,000 spectators.         
	The renovation is on in blocks B, C, K and L. We will lose around 40,000 seats since those blocks will not be ready at such short notice. Those blocks will be sealed and will not cause any inconvenience to the others, CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey said.

                                                     Aussies mull giving Ricky a break
                  Ricky Ponting                     
	Melbourne: The Australian cricket team may miss captain Ricky Ponting for the remaining one-dayers against New Zealand as the national selectors want to give him enough rest before the South Africa tour.         
	Michael Clarke would lead in Pontings absence.         
	Australias dismal run continued as they lost the first of the five-match series against New Zealand by two wickets in Perth Sunday.         
	The defeat followed their humiliating loss in both the ODI and the Test series at home against South Africa.         
	We are discussing Ricky having a break at the moment. The reality is if he doesnt take a break now, he wont get one until the end of the South African tour. So I think a break is quite likely, Andrew Hilditch, chairman of the national selection panel, was quoted as saying in an Australian daily.         
	Its been pretty hard on him since India  its been a long stint. Ricky wanted to play the entire South African series for obvious reasons, so if there is going to be a break, it will be against New Zealand.         
	Meanwhile, Ponting said Sunday that he wants Andrew Symonds on the South Africa tour. We are hurting with Andrew Symonds and Shane Watson missing, both the guys would be picked in our first XI, Ponting said.         
	South Africa will be a very big test for us and the Ashes is something we all want to be part of. I will be making that point to the selectors if they dont know that already, he added.

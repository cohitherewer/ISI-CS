                                                     Final drama not yet over
            A STAFF REPORTER            Chaminda Vaas of Mohun Bagan tests his football skills at the JU ground, Salt Lake, on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: The drama surrounding the JC Mukherjee Trophy final threatened to become farcical when the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) decided to call a meeting of the tournament committee on Saturday to decide the outcome of the match. This despite Kalighat not turning up to play the match on Tuesday.         
	In normal circumstances, the match should have been awarded to Mohun Bagan, their rivals who were present at the venue.         
	Kalighat sent a letter to the CAB in the evening, saying they would play the final if it were rescheduled.         
	Arun Mitra, joint secretary of the CAB, said: After getting the letter, weve called the tournament committees meeting on Saturday. Well decide the result of the match in that meeting.         
	Earlier in the evening, Mitra had said he would recommend action against Kalighat for not playing the twenty20 tournaments final. Ill recommend to the working committee that some action be taken. Otherwise, this could become a bad precedent, Mitra had remarked.         
	A defiant Bablu Kolay, secretary of Kalighat, had said: CAB can take action if it wants to. But I want to make it clear that weve not given a walkover to Mohun Bagan. We only said that we cant play the final on January 20 as our players need rest.         
	Informed about CABs apparent change of stance after getting the letter in the evening, Srinjoy Bose, assistant secretary of Bagan, said: I dont want to say what the CAB should do and what it shouldnt but I strongly believe nobody has the right to hold the parent body to ransom. It would be unfortunate if the final is rescheduled.         
	Citing the example of his own club, Bose said: We also had issues with the schedule of Federation Cup football. We sent a letter to the All India Football Federation but we never said wed pull out of the tournament.         
	We played on protest and won the tournament, the official pointed out.

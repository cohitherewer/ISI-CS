The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australia are back on track
                                                                                                                       7                                      Australia are back on track
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                       
	Shane Watson and Michael Clarke put Australias hopes of a crushing Boxing Day Test victory at the MCG back on track after the top order was rocked by Pakistans twin pace pairing of Mohammed Aamer and Mohammed Asif in the final session on Day III.         
	Within the first 12 overs of the second innings, Ricky Ponting (12) and Michael Hussey (four) succumbed to 17-year-old firebrand Aamer (two for 43), and opener Simon Katich (two) fell to Asif (one for 16).         
	But Watson (64 not out), who scored his seventh half-century in 12 innings this year, and Clarkes circumspect unbeaten knock of 21 off 65 balls guided the hosts to 111 for three  and a huge lead of 307  at stumps. They compiled an unbeaten 71-run fourth-wicket stand.

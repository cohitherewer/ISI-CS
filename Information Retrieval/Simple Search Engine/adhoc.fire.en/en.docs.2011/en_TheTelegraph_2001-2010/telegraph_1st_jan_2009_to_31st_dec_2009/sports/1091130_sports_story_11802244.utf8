The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Md. Sp. set to miss foreigners
                                                                                                                       7                                      Md. Sp. set to miss foreigners
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting will miss their foreign striking duo of Eduardo Escobar and Theodore Sunday in their Calcutta Football League match against BNR on Monday. While Eduardo is out with a double booking, Sunday is suffering from viral fever.         
	Gautam Thakur is likely to partner Dipendu Biswas upfront. Coach Shabbir Ali may also have a look at youngsters Shaheed and Lucky Imran. The under-19 player Lucky Imran is coming in place of Suman Bose, who was impressive in their last match.         
	Mohammedan Sporting were held to a 1-1 draw by Mohammedan AC last Thursday and will definitely like to get back to winning ways.         
	Dipendu, who scored the equaliser a minute after coming in as a substitute in place of Sashti Duley, will want to grab this chance with both hands.         
	Ever since Sunday returned from his eight-month lay-off, Dipendu has been relegated to the bench. Monday gives him a chance to prove a point.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Two golds for India
                                                   Two golds for India
                      
	Kunshan (China): Shot putter Om Prakash and long distance runner Surendra Singh fetched a yellow metal each as Indian athletes won two gold, three silver and four bronze medals in the Asian Grand Prix second leg here Wednesday.         
	Om Prakash threw the iron ball to a distance of 19.48m to improve upon his personal best (19.36m) outside India which he set four days ago in the first leg at Suzhou.         
	He, however, failed to cross the Berlin World Championships B standard of 19.90m.         
	Surendra, who bagged a gold in 3000m at Suzhou, fetched his second gold of the Asian Grand Prix series by winning the mens 500m race in the second leg here.         
	He clocked 13:40.45 to win the race though his effort failed to touch the Berlin B standard of 13:29.00.         
	India won all the medals in the race with Kashinath Aswale (13:44.32) and Sandip Kumar (13:47.45) winning the silver and bronze, respectively.         
	In a closely contested 400m race for men, Bibin Mathew was second (46.48) followed by his VB Bineesh (47.12).         
	In mens high jump, Hari Shankar Roy finished third with a leap of 2.15m. (PTI)

            Ranji Round Up            Ajinkya Rahane                     
	Hyderabad: Sahil Kukreja (87) and Ajinkya Rahane (89) were on course for their individual centuries as defending champions Mumbai reached 198 for one against Hyderabad at the end of Day II of their Ranji Trophy Super League group A match Thursday.         
	Mumbai are trailing by 68 runs but with nine-wickets in hand they can easily go on to consolidate their position.         
	Overnight Hyderabad-batsman Syed Quadri added 28 runs to his total and remained unbeaten on 76 as the hosts were folded for 266.         
	Meanwhile, in Vadodara, skipper Irfan Pathans unbeaten 52 was the only semblance of resistance as Baroda were 137 for nine, still needing a mammoth 351 runs to stop Karnataka from taking a first innings lead.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeers greet Beckham at home
                                                   Jeers greet Beckham at home
                      
	Los Angeles: David Beckhams contribution in both of the Galaxys goals in their 2-2 draw against AC Milan would have pleased the clubs supporters. But Sundays friendly was surely an unpleasant experience for the former England captain as he was ushered away by security guards after he confronted fans who provided an ugly reception for his return to the Los Angeles Galaxy home ground.         
	Beckham was playing at home for the first time since he returned to the Galaxy after controversially extending his loan spell with Milan into the first half of the Major League Soccer season.         
	The former England captain had also seemingly fallen out with his teammates with Galaxy captain Landon Donovan reportedly questioning his effort and leadership last season.         
	Beckham was constantly booed on Sunday by many in the 27,000 sell out crowd, with some holding derisive banners. One said go home fraud, while another read Hey Becks, here before you, here after you, here despite you.         
	Beckham was visibly annoyed at the frequent jeering and had to be escorted away by security as the players left the field at halftime when he walked over to an area of seats to confront the booing fans. Security was tightened in the second half.         
	After Thiago Silva had put Milan in front, Beckham provided a field-length cross to Landon Donovan, who set up Alan Gordon for the equaliser in the 29th minute.         
	Filippo Inzaghi put the Italian giants ahead again in the 61st minute only for Bryan Jordan to connect on a Beckham corner in the 65th minute and equalise at 2-2. After the second goal, Beckham turned in the direction of the stadium that had been the most vitriolic and simply shrugged his shoulders. He was substituted after 75 minutes.

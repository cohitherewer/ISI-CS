	Calcutta: Kolkata Knight Riders have short-listed 27 players who will travel to South Africa for the conditioning camp preceding the second edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL). The Shah Rukh Khan-owned franchise had earlier proposed to take 24 players. The number will be pruned down after cricket manager John Buchanan has a close look at the players in South Africa.         
	It was learnt that Buchanan was keen on having 24 players on board, but the number was revised after consultation with other members of the team management.         
	Debabrata Das and Mohnish Parmar will be left out of the 28-member players list announced earlier. As of now, former India all-rounder Sanjay Bangar is the only player outside the initial list who will travel to South Africa. The Knight Riders will be based in Bloemfontein.         
	Once we get there, if the team management feels that a certain player needs to be tried out or will be more suited to the conditions, he might be again called for trials Basically we need to see how the players adapt to totally different conditions, a Knight Riders official said.               
	Knight Riders had their final practice session at the Eden on Monday morning. The players spent around three hours under the watchful eyes of Buchanan. In keeping with the nature of wickets in South Africa, the stress was on tackling short balls  thrown at different lengths from a bowling machine  at the nets.         
	There was no official word, but it is most likely that Sourav Ganguly will be the nominated captain in their first match against Deccan Chargers on April 19.         
	Buchanan left for Mumbai on Monday afternoon to be present at the launch of the team jersey. He is also slated to meet Shah Rukh before leaving for South Africa. Sourav is also expected to be in Mumbai on Tuesday.         
	The players are expected to leave in batches, with the first group set to depart early Wednesday morning. Sourav is likely to leave on Sunday.         
	It is a matter of logistics Were working out the schedule for the players. Players will be leaving in batches from Mumbai and Delhi, the official said.         
	Bengals Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Wriddhiman Saha, Ashok Dinda and Sourav Sarkar will leave on Wednesday.

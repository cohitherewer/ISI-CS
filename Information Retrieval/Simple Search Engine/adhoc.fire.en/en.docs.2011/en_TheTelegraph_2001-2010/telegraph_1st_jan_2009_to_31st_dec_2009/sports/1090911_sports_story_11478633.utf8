The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB keen to revive ties
                                                   PCB keen to revive ties
                      
	Karachi: The Boards of India and Pakistan are in touch to discuss the resumption of bilateral cricket ties in the near future.         
	Sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said a BCCI official had spoken to them this week and discussions had also revolved around the possibility of the revival of bilateral cricket with matches at neutral venues.         
	The PCB is very keen to push this idea as a series against India will improve its financial health considerably and also allow it to meet its commitments with the broadcasters who are paying a lot of money for the television rights, a source said.         
	The source confirmed that the PCB wanted to convince the Indians to play a short series of one or two one-day Internationals and a T20 match at some neutral venue.         
	The ice can be broken with a short series which can happen if the Indian government gives the go ahead to its Board, the source said.         
	The source added that the BCCI had assured PCB that it was keen to see Pakistani players in next years IPL.         
	The PCB has already cleared all-rounder Abdul Razzaq and some other players for signing up with IPL franchises.         
	Bilateral sporting ties took a hit early this year after the Mumbai terror attacks. Indias Test tour of Pakistan in January was called off and that cost the PCB $25-30 million.         
	Meanwhile, former ICC president Ehsan Mani has held the BCCI responsible for the shifting of the 2011 World Cup matches out of the country and said the move was a deliberate effort on BCCIs part to isolate Pakistan from the cricketing world.         
	Mani was critical about Indias role in ICCs decision to shift Pakistans share of World Cup matches out of the nation due to security concerns and said BCCIs financial might lends it an upper hand in the world body.         
	I can say this with conviction that no Board is today able to stand up to the Indian Board in the ICC. Unfortunately, it is all about making money these days and the Indians dominate, he said.         
	In a calculated manner, India is trying to isolate Pakistan from international cricket, he added.           (PTI)

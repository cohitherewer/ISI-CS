The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB gesture draws praise
                                                   CAB gesture draws praise
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengals decision to invite former state captains, currently associated with the Indian Cricket League, to Sourav Gangulys felicitation has raised quite a few eyebrows but the men in question are finding nothing wrong with the move.         
	Pranab Roy, Deep Dasgupta and Rohan Gavaskar will be present at the Eden on Sunday, but Ashok Malhotra is still undecided because of prior commitments. The CAB, it may be recalled, had kept them out of bounds during Prasun Mukherjees regime.         
	It obviously feels good Its a sort of recognition, said Deep. A very good gesture and is definitely an honour.         
	Rohan did not wish to say anything but was obviously happy at CABs gesture.         
	Malhotra, though, was forthcoming. I have got the invitation, but dont know whether I will be able to make it since I have prior commitments. Theres nothing wrong in it If the BCCI can invite Kapil Dev for a felicitation, why cant the CAB? said Malhotra.

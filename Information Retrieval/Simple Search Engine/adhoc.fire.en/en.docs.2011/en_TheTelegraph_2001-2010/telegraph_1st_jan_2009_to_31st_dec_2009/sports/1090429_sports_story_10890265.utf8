The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A blockbuster on the cards
                                                   A blockbuster on the cards
                      
	Durban: Two buoyant sides, boasting of some of the best stroke-players in contemporary cricket, will collide when the Kings XI Punjab take on the Mumbai Indians in a potential humdinger in the Indian Premier League here Wednesday.         
	The Yuvraj Singh-led Kings XI have managed to revive their campaign with back-to-back victories over Royal Challengers Bangalore and defending champions Rajasthan Royals.         
	That lifted the pall of gloom that had descended on the Kings XI camp following their defeats against the Delhi DareDevils and the Kolkata Knight Riders in two rain-marred ties.         
	In contrast, the Mumbai Indians got off to a perfect start with a victory over last years finalists, Chennai Super Kings, before sharing points with the Royals from their washed-out outing.         
	Tendulkar and his men tasted their first defeat against the all-conquering Deccan Chargers in their third tie but shrugged off the setback with a thumping 92-run win over the Knight Riders.         
	Tendulkar himself has led from the front with his consistent display at the top in the company of the ageless Sanath Jayasuriya.         
	JP Duminy didnt convert the start Monday but the exciting Proteas youngster is unlikely to squander another chance to impress the home crowd.         
	In contrast, the Kings XI batting has been inconsistent with Yuvrajs reputation, as one of the deadliest batsmen in this format, in tatters.         
	Rather, Kumar Sangakkaras has been a reassuring presence in the middle and it was the Lankans unbeaten half-century that paved the way for the sides victory against the Royals.         
	Irfan Pathan has also done justice to his all-rounders reputation, shining both with the bat and ball. (PTI)

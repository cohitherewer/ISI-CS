The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kaka tipped to join Real Madrid 
                                                     Kaka tipped to join Real Madrid 
                  Kaka                     
	Milan: AC Milan star Kakas future remained unresolved Wednesday amid reports that he could be on his way to Real Madrid in a euro65 million ($92 million) deal.         
	Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani was in Madrid on Tuesday night to finalise the deal, along with Kakas father-manager Bosco Leite, Italian sports dailies La Gazzetta dello Sport and Corriere dello Sport reported Wednesday.         
	After four hours of meetings with Madrid president Florentino Perez, a deal was reached under which Kaka would get euro9.5 million ($13.5 million) a season for five years, Gazzetta said.         
	But Britains Sky Sports News said that Chelsea had countered Madrids offer by bidding 73.5 million (euro85 million; $120 million) for Kaka and offering him 10 million (euro11.6 million; $16.4 million) per year in wages after tax, a report that the London club denied.         
	Kakas coach at Milan, Carlo Ancelotti, was appointed Monday as Chelseas new manager.         
	None of the clubs involved have offered official confirmation on the dealings.         
	Milan said on its website that Galliani was only in Madrid because he had been previously invited to attend a dinner honouring Perez. Madrid said it had nothing to announce.         
	Kakas Milan teammates seemed resigned to seeing the 2007 world player of the year leave.         
	I want to wait until it becomes official, but of course it greatly upsets me, Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso said from Italys training camp.         
	Kaka is not just any old player. Someone who helps you win is leaving.         
	Gattuso said the current financial crisis may play a role in Milans apparent decision to sell Kaka.         
	When confronted with certain numbers, the club decided to put him on the market, Gattuso said, according to the a news agency. Im on Milans payroll and if the club has made that decision its not up to me to intervene.         
	About 30 fans protested Kakas possible transfer outside Milans downtown offices, in a scene similar to when the Brazilian was considering going to Manchester City.         
	Kaka flew home on Monday to Brazil to join the national team for World Cup qualifiers and the Confederations Cup.         
	Before leaving, however, he insisted he was happy in Milan.         
	I want to stay with Milan and from today this issue is over, Kaka said in Gazzetta on Tuesday. I will say it for the last time, the last time. I dont want to leave Milan.         
	But Milan owner Premier Silvio Berlusconi conceded he didnt think he could keep the Brazilian midfielder. I dont think we can keep him back because they (Real) are offering so much money, he said Tuesday.         
	Kaka was also the subject of a failed record bid by City in January that would have made him the best-paid player in football, but he turned down the move saying he chose Milan over money.         
	New Madrid coach Manuel Pellegrini said this week he planned to bring in new players to revitalise the club which finished second in the league behind Barcelona.         
	Perez instituted the galactico policy of signing the games biggest stars during his first tenure with the club, and has pledged a similar approach to the transfer market this off-season.         
	The Brazilian, whose full name is Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite, joined AC Milan from Sao Paulo in 2003 and has won Serie A, the Champions League and the Fifa Club World Cup with the Rossoneri, as well as personally claiming the Ballon dOr and Fifa World Player of the Year in 2007.

                                                   WI make no changes in squad
            CRICKET BRIEFS                
	 Kingston: The West Indies on Monday named an unchanged 13-man squad for the third and fourth one-day Internationals against India at Beausejour Stadium in St Lucia on July 3 and 5. The four-match series is levelled 1-1.         
	The squad         
	Chris Gayle(c), Denesh Ramdin(wk), Lionel Baker, Darren Bravo, Dwayne Bravo, Sulieman Benn, David Bernard, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Narsingh Deonarine, Runako Morton, Ravi Rampaul, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Jerome Taylor.         
	PCB hope         
	 Karachi: Snubbed by the ICC and the other host countries of the 2011 World Cup, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is now trying to restore the hosting rights of the matches through the governing bodys dispute resolutions committee. PCB chairman, Ejaz Butt said that Pakistan would first try to get the matter resolved by the ICC disputes resolution committee.         
	FTP issue         
	 Karachi: The PCB is unhappy with the Future Tours Programme (FTP) drafted by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) since it does not include any bilateral series between the arch-rivals. The draft proposed by India does not have any Test series against Pakistan, which is astonishing since both boards have an agreement they would play against each other once every two years in both countries, a PCB official said.         
	Pak dilemma         
	 Karachi: The return of former ICL players Mohammed Yousuf and Abdul Razzaq to the national fold has created a problem of plenty for Pakistan, which now faces a selection dilemma. With Yousuf and Razzaq back, the tour selectors are not sure what to do because if both Yousuf and Razzaq are selected then the axe will fall on former captain Shoaib Malik, one source said.         
	Javed warning         
	 Karachi: Pakistan are in for a tough battle against Sri Lanka in the forthcoming Test series despite their recent triumph in the World Twenty20, warned former player Javed Miandad. I think the amount of responsibility on our players to do well has now increased a lot after their World T20 triumph, Miandad said.         
	Davidson view         
	 Melbourne: Brett Lee does not merit a place in Australias main Ashes squad and his role should be confined to mentoring the bowlers, said former Aussie pacer Alan Davidson. Davidson, who tormented England in the 1953 and 1961 Ashes tours, said Australia should stick to the successful pace battery that delivered the goods in South Africa this year.         
	Surprise guest         
	 Worcester: Ricky Ponting and his teammates had a surprise visitor at their Ashes training session in Worcester as Australian Formula One driver Mark Webber turned up for an interaction with them. The Red Bull driver accepted friend Pontings invitation and interacted with the players and looked happy after his experience.           AGENCIES

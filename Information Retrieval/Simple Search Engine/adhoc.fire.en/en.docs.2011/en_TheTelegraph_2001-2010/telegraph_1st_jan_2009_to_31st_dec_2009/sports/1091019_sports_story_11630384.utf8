            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Already out of contention for a place in the semi-finals, the Delhi DareDevils will play Cape Cobras from South Africa in an inconsequential T20 Champions League match at the Kotla on Monday.         
	The DareDevils crashed out of the tournament on Saturday, when they lost to Royal Challengers Bangalore in a League B Super Eight encounter. The South Africans have already assured themselves of a place in the semi-finals after their eight-wicket win over Victoria Bushrangers.         
	Yet, Mondays contest would be of some interest as the local crowd will get a chance to watch in-form Cobras batsman Jean-Paul Duminy, one of the most talked about youngsters in international cricket these days.

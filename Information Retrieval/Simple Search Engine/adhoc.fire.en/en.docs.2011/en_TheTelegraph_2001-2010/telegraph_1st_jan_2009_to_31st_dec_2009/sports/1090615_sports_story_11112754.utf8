The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chote nawab turns up at Lords
                                                     Chote nawab turns up at Lords
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Saif Ali Khan                           
	London: Saif Ali Khan, the chote nawab, was at Lords on Sunday afternoon, decades after his father, Mansur Ali Khan (the nawab of Pataudi), last took guard at the home of cricket.         
	In town in connection with his latest movie, Love Aaj Kal, Saif was accompanied by Deepika Padukone, once linked to Mahendra Singh Dhoni and, later, Yuvraj Singh.         
	While at Lords, Saif and Deepika spent some time in the media centre before being escorted out by security personnel. It was there that Saif, sporting a bandana, ran into Sunil Gavaskar and Ian Chappell.         
	Hows the old man? Give him my regards, Ian remarked, after Gavaskar introduced him to Saif. Deepika was introduced as the daughter of Indias finest badminton player.         
	Ian was impressed.         
	Interacting briefly with The Telegraph, Saif said: Ill definitely be rooting for the Indian team, but I dont have favourites from this generation... My heroes played in the Seventies, like Dennis Lillee... I liked Tony Greig too...         
	Didnt he hero-worship his father, arguably Indias finest captain?         
	Of course, yes... Dad as well, Saif replied, laughing.

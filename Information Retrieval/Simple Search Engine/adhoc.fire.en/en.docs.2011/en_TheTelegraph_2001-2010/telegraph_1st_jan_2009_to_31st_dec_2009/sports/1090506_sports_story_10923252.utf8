                                                   Gambhir: Knew we could achieve target
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	The Delhi DareDevils stand-in-captain Gautam Gambhir led from the front against the Kolkata Knight Riders on Tuesday with a match-winning unbeaten knock of 71 off 57 balls.         
	The Delhiite, whose effort saw him walk away with the Man of the Match award, said that he was always confident of chasing down the Knight Riders total after having restricted them to a modest 154. The way they started, I thought that they might end up with 180 on the board. But then Amit (Mishra) and Ashish (Nehera) bowled really well to restrict them. I was confident that 154 was achievable, he said.         
	Asked whether he was happy having played such a crucial innings, Gambhir replied: To be honest, Im not hitting the ball well. I knew the importance of staying at the wicket. It was my job to see the team through today (Tuesday) and Im happy to have achieved that.         
	Gambhir was also elated with the form of Sri Lankan Tillekaratne Dilshan.         
	Knight Riders captain Brendon McCullum couldnt hide his disappointment at yet another loss. Its disappointing. We cant afford to drop catches in such matches, he rued. He added: Its hard to recover when you lose. We are working hard but just cant get the result, he said.

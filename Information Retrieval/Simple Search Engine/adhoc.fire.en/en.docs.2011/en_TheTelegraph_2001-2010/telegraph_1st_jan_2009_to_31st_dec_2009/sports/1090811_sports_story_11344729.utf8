The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger Woods hits out at officials
                                                   Tiger Woods hits out at officials
                      
	Akron (US): Tiger Woods criticised rules officials at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational on Sunday after he overhauled Irishman Padraig Harrington to win the elite tournament for a record seventh time.         
	The American world No. 1 effectively sealed victory with a birdie at the par-five 16th, where he struck a superb eight-iron to a foot after he and Harrington had been put on the clock for slow play.         
	Harringtons bid for a first title in 12 months on either the PGA or European tours unravelled on that hole as he ran up an ugly triple-bogey eight after hitting his fourth shot into water. The resulting four-shot swing ended a gripping duel between the players.         
	Although Woods accepted his brilliant third shot from 178 yards had put the pressure back on Harrington, he slammed European Tour chief referee John Paramor for his decision to put them on the clock. Im sorry that John got in the way of a great battle because it was such a great battle for 16 holes, Woods said.         
	I think being on the clock influenced Padraig. Im sure he would have taken a lot more time on his third shot to try to figure out how to play it, where to place the next one.         
	While on the clock, players must play their shots within an allocated time or risk an initial warning followed by a $5,000 fine and a one-shot penalty for a second offence.         
	Paramor defended his decision.         
	Padraig and Tigers group were 13 minutes over time through 11 holes, he said in statement. We could have put them on the clock at the 13th but we opted to cut them a bit of slack due to problems up at the 16th green at that time.

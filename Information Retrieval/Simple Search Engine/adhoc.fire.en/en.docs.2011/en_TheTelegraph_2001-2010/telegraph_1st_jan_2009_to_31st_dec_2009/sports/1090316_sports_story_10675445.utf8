	The win propelled him to fourth position on the PGTI Order of Merit from 38th. I attribute my win to my good driving and mental toughness this week.         
	Today I had a fantastic round. I was sharp in all departments of my game. My concentration also got better on the back nine as I came closer to victory, Bhullar said after his victory.         
	Its a special win because its my first since I turned professional in December 2006. Ive waited a long time for this moment and I really have no words to describe my joy, he said.

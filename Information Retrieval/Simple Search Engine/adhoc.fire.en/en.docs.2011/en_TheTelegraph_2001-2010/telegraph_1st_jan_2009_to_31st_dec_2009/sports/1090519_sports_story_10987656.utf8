The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Humiliated Bhutia to sever ties with Bagan
                                                     Humiliated Bhutia to sever ties with Bagan
    - India captain asks for release, visits club tent and picks up his belongings           A STAFF REPORTER            Bhaichung Bhutia watches teammates practise at the Howrah Stadium on Monday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: His commitment questioned and the icon feeling humiliated after Mohun Bagan leaked the contents of the show cause notice to the media even before it had reached him, Bhaichung Bhutia sought a release order from the club at the earliest.         
	Speaking to the reporters at a news conference at the Howrah Stadium on Monday, the Bagan and India skipper did not mince his words.         
	After what has happened in the last few days I have no inspiration left to play for this club. I had a meeting with the club in the morning and I have told them clearly that I want a release order at the earliest, Bhaichung rattled off from a piece of paper.         
	Bhaichung, for the record, signed a two-year contract in 2008 and is believed to have cost Bagan approximately Rs 42 lakh for the 2008-09 season. Bhaichung, who had an equally tumultuous one-year stay in Bagan in 2002, rejoined the club in 2006 after the ruling Swapan Sadhan Bose and Anjan Mitra group came to power the year before.         
	Club secretary Mitra, the brain behind the show cause notice, reacted strongly and said nobody from the club had met Bhaichung officially. At least I am not aware of any such meeting. We are still waiting for his reply and will take a call only after that. Right now, we are in no mood to relent, he said. Mitra, however, said that there was no timeframe for a reply.         
	Earlier, blasting the secretary, Bhaichung said that the club could have handled this affair in a much more professional way. I am playing football for the last 18 years and nobody ever doubted my commitment. They are trying to make me a scapegoat for the clubs failure to win the I-League. Its very unfair. How can the media come to know of the content of the show cause notice before me? I feel humiliated and slighted. They dont have any right to malign me like this, Bhaichung never sounded so peeved.         
	The India skipper, who reached the city from Mumbai on Sunday night, said that the club and the coach (Karim Bencharifa) were aware of the dance programme he was participating in. They were in the loop and the programme is on air for the last two months. Why didnt the club voice their reservations then? And I never missed a single match for this programme. Now for an exhibition match (played at Jalpaiguri) which I skipped, they serve me this notice, he said.         
	Bhaichungs no-show in Jalpaiguri was a face loss for the club since the match was marketed as the Bhutia-Barreto combine in Jalpaiguri for the first time. Barreto skipped for a pressing family engagement, Bhaichung, the club believed, deliberately shirked.         
	Bhaichung refused to buy the fact that the since the national players would be missing domestic action for most of the coming season, the club wanted to get rid of him. Why did they sign new contracts with N.S. Manju, Deepak Mondal and Rakesh Masih then? Also I dont think me being the president of the FPAI (Football Players Association of India) played any role. Why should they suddenly feel intimidated when the association was formed three years back?         
	Clearing the air about his commitment, Bhaichung said it was decided after the Mahindra United match (their last I-League tie on April 16) that the focus should be on winning the Super Cup. I was told that I may not travel to Kuwait for the AFC Cup match.         
	I have newspaper cuttings with me where two of the coaches (Al Wehdat and Kuwait SC) praised my performance against them. And talking about the Mahindra match, at half time when news filtered in that Churchill Brothers were winning, leading 3-0 against Mohammedan Sporting, most of the players lost motivation.         
	The fact that the I-League slipped away after coming so close left the players dejected. I think that was the reason why we lost to Mahindra. And the club think I am to be blamed for the loss, he sounded surprised.         
	 Bhaichung, in fact, met the team members before the news conference and told them about his intentions. He sounded very upset and told us goodbye. We knew something was brewing but never thought of this. We (the players) will miss him. I hope he changes his mind, a senior player told The Telegraph late on Monday.         
	Well, that seems unlikely as the India skipper drove straight to the club tent from the Howrah Stadium and picked up all his belongings. Bhaichungs three-year association with Bagan looks well and truly over.

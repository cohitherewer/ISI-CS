The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Weve no issues with clause: PCB
                                                   Weve no issues with clause: PCB
                      
	Karachi: The Board of Control for Cricket India (BCCI) may consider a World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) anti-doping clause unreasonable but the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) disagrees and believes the Indian players are unlikely to be exempted from signing the document despite their Boards tough stand.         
	The PCBs chief operating officer Saleem Altaf said that Pakistan had no issues with the contentious whereabouts clause in the Wada agreement that has been rejected by the Indian board and its players.         
	The automatic anti-doping and testing mechanism outlined in the new agreement by Wada is acceptable to us and nine of our male and two female cricketers have signed it, Altaf said.         
	All the cricket-playing nations including Pakistan are Wada compliant. So, I dont think there is any way any country can escape this issue, he added.           (PTI)

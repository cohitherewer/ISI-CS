The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand plays out draw to finish fourth
                                                   Anand plays out draw to finish fourth
                      
	Linares: Viswanathan Anand had to be content with a fourth place finish following his final round draw against Magnus Carlsen of Norway in the Linares chess tournament here on Sunday.         
	GM Alexander Grischuk of Russia won the tournament after settling for a draw with Levon Aronian of Armenia. Grischuk finished with eight points in all and tied for the top spot along with Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine.         
	The tiebreak favoured Grischuk as he had won three games in the event compared to two victories by Ivanchuk who drew with Lenier Dominguez of Cuba in his final round game. The tiebreak favoured the player with more decisive games and so, despite remaining unbeaten, Ivanchuk finished second.         
	Carlsen finished third on 7.5 points, half a point ahead of Anand, who, in turn, had half a point more than Aronian, Wang Yue of China and Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan. Dominiguez finished last on 6 points.         
	The final day did not have even a single decisive game and the standings remained same as they were after the penultimate round. Grischuk gained a great deal from his performance here as apart from the trophy and winners cheque, the Russian also earned the right to take part in the Grand Slam final scheduled to be held in Bilbao, Spain later this year.

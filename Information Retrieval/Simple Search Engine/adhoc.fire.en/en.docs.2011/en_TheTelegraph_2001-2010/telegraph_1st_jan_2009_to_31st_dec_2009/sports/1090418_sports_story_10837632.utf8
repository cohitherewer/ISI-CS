The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Button best at practice
                                                     Button best at practice
                  Jenson Button                     
	Shanghai: Jenson Button made the best possible start to his quest for a third successive Formula One victory by setting the quickest lap time in Fridays two practice sessions for the Chinese Grand Prix.         
	Button, who won the first two races of the season from pole position, again showed the pace of his Brawn GP car with a storming lap of one minute, 35.679 seconds late in the second session.         
	For Force India, Giancarlo Fisichella struggled for balance but teammate Adrian Sutil had a strong start to his Chinese Grand Prix campaign with the German clocking the 14th and the 11th quickest times respectively in the morning and the afternoon practice sessions.         
	Fisichella struggled to find a good balance on the VJM02 and was 17th (1:38.460) in the morning session and 20th (1:37.750) in the afternoon. The only consolation for him was that he managed 50 laps over the day and gathered a lot of information to improve overnight.         
	In contrast, Sutil enjoyed a strong day as he set the 14th quickest (1:38.319) time in the morning and 11th (1:36.829) in the afternoon.         
	German Nico Rosberg also left it late before posting a time of 1.35.704 for Williams to edge Brazilian Barrichello (1.35.881) and deny Brawn GP the top-two times of the day.         
	Weve improved a car a lot over the day, but theres still a bit more work to do until Im completely happy, said the 29-year-old Button, who leads the championship by five points over teammate Rubens Barrichello. There seemed to be a lot of traffic on the track today (Friday) so my main concern was finding some clear air.         
	World champion Lewis Hamilton had put his McLaren teams troubles behind him by setting the quickest time in first practice but faded in the second session.         
	The 24-year-old Briton, whose title defence has been marred by struggles on the track and controversy off it, finished 13th fastest in the quicker afternoon session at the track where he claimed his last win in the penultimate race of the 2008 season.         
	Ferraris travails also continued with Brazilian Felipe Massa 12th fastest in second practice and Kimi Raikkonen managing only the 14th best time for the reigning constructors champions. Raikkonen came off the track in both sessions, one of several drivers struggling with grip as teams weighed their tyre choices for the weekend.

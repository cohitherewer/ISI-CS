	 Pietersen defends dismissal
    Cardiff: England may lament and Australia may lampoon his brain-snap dismissal in the first innings of the ongoing first Ashes Test but a nonchalant Kevin Pietersen is in no mood to oblige his critics.         
	The sooner people realise I will keep on playing shots, and I will keep on playing the way I play, the better, Pietersen said. I looked at the dismissal from the first innings and it does look quite funny and quite peculiar. But Id actually played with a lot of restraint up until that point and Ive played that paddle sweep so many times before, Pietersen resoned.               
	 Akhtar issue

	 Tanvir hopeful

I think even the IPL franchises now want to play their Pakistani players. The IPL has also said it has no problems. So I think the next time the IPL is held you will see Pakistani players taking part in it, Tanvir said.

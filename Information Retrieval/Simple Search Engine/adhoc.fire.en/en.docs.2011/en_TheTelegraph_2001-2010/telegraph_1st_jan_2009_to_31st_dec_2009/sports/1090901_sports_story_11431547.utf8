	Calcutta: Chirag United coach Subrata Bhattacharya may after all be present during their IFA Shield match against Tata Football Academy at the Mohun Bagan ground on Tuesday.         
	On Monday morning after a practice session at the Salt Lake Stadium, Bhattacharya had hinted that he might skip the match. Last year after Chirags Calcutta Football League tie against the green and maroon brigade, Bhattacharya was heckled by some Bagan supporters. So this time, apparently, he had told the Chirag officials to let Anjan Nag, the assistant coach, sit on the bench.         
	Later in the evening Chirag officials said Bhattacharya had mellowed down after much persuasion and were confident of the their coach present at the ground.         
	The Tata Football Academy, meanwhile, reached the city on Monday evening, barely hours before the kick-off. Shyam Thapa, the academys new technical director said have one Robin Singh, a tall striker, which is a rarity in Indian football these days.         
	Two-time champions Mahindra United also begin their campaign on Tuesday. They take on George Telegraph at the Khardah Stadium, on the outskirts.         
	The team wanted to have a venue practice, so they went to the stadium. The team started at 8.30 a.m. from their hotel and came back at 2.30 in the afternoon!         
	Just for a 45-minute practice session, so much travelling! joked team manager Henry Menezes. And for coach David Booth one could have come back from the moon in the time consumed!         
	The four national team players  Steven Dias, NP Pradeep, Subhasish Roy Choudhury and Sushil Singh  will be joining on Tuesday.         
	Skipper K Ajayan has been ruled out due to a broken arm. He is also getting married on Saturday, Menezes said.

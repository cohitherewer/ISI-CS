The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Egypt hold India 2-2 
                                                     Egypt hold India 2-2 
                  Sandeep Singh                     
	Ipoh: India started their Azlan Shah campaign on a disappointing note, conceding a last-gasp goal to settle for a 2-2 draw against tournament debutants Egypt here Sunday.         
	The Indians, who were runners-up last year, scored through Sandeep Singh (14th minute) and Shivender Singh (50th), while Mohamed Hasan (8th) and Amr El Saied (70th) sounded the board for the Egyptians.         
	Saieds goal came just 40 seconds before the final hooter. Disappointed with the result, India coach Harendra Singh said he has no words to explain the teams poor show.         
	You do not expect to win matches with this kind of performance, coach Harendra Singh said after the match.         
	In a match played on a soggy pitch following heavy downpour, the Egyptians, who were playing here for the first time, took the lead in the eighth minute when Hasan converted from a penalty corner. India went on the offensive and equalised in the 15th minute in a similar fashion through their penalty corner specialist Sandeep.         
	The Indians kept attacking but poor finishing meant that the scoreline read 1-1 at half-time. The Indians finally took the lead in the 50th minute through another penalty corner, converted by Shivender.         
	The Egyptians kept up the pressure before snatching a 70th-minute goal through a penalty corner.         
	In the second match hosts Malaysia shocked Pakistan 3-2 to win their opening match.           (PTI)

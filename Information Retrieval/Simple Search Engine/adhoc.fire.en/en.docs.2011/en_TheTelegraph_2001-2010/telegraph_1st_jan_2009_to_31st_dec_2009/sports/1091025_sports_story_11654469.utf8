                                                     Hussey: India will miss Zaheer Khan
                  Mike Hussey                     
	Vadodara: India will badly miss the services of pacer Zaheer Khan in the One-Day International series against Australia starting here Sunday, but the hosts still have a potent bowling attack, according to Australia vice captain Michel Hussey.         
	Zaheer has not been included in the India squad for the first two one-dayers as he is recuperating from a surgery, after injuring his shoulder during the second Indian Premier League (IPL) in South Africa earlier this year.         
	The last time we were here (for the Test series), Zaheer was a crucial bowler for the Indians, and his absence will be a big loss for their attack, Hussey said, on the eve of opening encounter of the series, here Saturday.         
	Ishant Sharma still looks a wonderful bowler to me, he is always a difficult customer. I have not faced the other quickies much while we were here, but they have a very good bowling attack, and it will be wrong to underestimate them, he added.         
	They have some fine bowlers, who bowl well in Indian conditions, he pointed out.         
	Even though Hussey praised the Indian spin attack, he hoped the Aussies would be able to put pressure on the hosts to come up trumps.         
	Its wrong to underestimate the Indian spinners. Harbhajan Singh has an amazing record and has played some brilliant games. (Amit) Mishra is a very good spinner as well. Hopefully, we can put all their bowlers and batsmen under pressure, and can come out on top, he said.         
	The left-hander agreed with India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in saying the length of the series would provide the teams an opportunity to bounce back. I agree (with Dhoni). The more matches, the more chances you have to get back into the series if you get off to a bad start, Hussey said.         
	He also stressed on the importance of gaining a momentum, which, he felt, both teams would strive for.         
	Both teams play well with momentum. Once the Indians get confidence and momentum, they can be very difficult to stop. It is similar with Australia. Once we get momentum and confidence, we are a difficult team to beat. The first few games are going to be crucial. But if things dont go right, theres still time to try and catch up, he elaborated.         
	Hussey said that the visitors, too, were not motivated by the rankings.

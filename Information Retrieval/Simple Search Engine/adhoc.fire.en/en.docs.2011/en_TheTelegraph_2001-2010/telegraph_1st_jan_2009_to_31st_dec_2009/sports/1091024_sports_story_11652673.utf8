The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shukla only option
                                                   Shukla only option
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Lack of options may ultimately lead the Cricket Association of Bengal to retain Laxmi Ratan Shukla as the Bengal captain for the ensuing Ranji Trophy.         
	For Bengal, changing the captain could have been an option to reignite the zeal in the team. But as a CAB official put it Friday, even if we try to replace Laxmi, we dont have any options. Manoj Tiwary is not the right guy at the moment, while Wriddhiman Saha shouldnt be burdened with the job. The rest are either not performing or are simply not captaincy material.         
	One camp, though, believes that making Deep Dasgupta the captain with Wriddhiman as his understudy is a viable option.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania moves into quarters
                                                     Sania moves into quarters
                  Sania Mirza                     
	New Delhi: Top-seeded Sania Mirza quelled a late challenge from American wildcard Laura Granville to enter the quarter finals of the $75,000 International Tennis Federation (ITF) Vancuover Open according to information received here on Friday.         
	Competing in only the third ITF event of her career, the Indian ace defeated Granville 6-2, 7-5.         
	Sania will now take on local favourite Rebecca Marino in the last-eight stage.         
	Rebecca stunned eighth seed Australian Olivia Rogowska 7-5, 7-6 (0) to make the quarter finals.         
	Laura had advanced to the second round after her Japanese opponent Aiko Nakamura conceded the match when leading 4-3 in the final set.         
	Sania had won the ITF Lexington Challenger recently.         
	Her year had started on a high note after winning the Australian Open mixed doubles with compatriot Mahesh Bhupathi in January. She then reached the final of the Pattaya Open in February where she lost to Vera Zvonareva. However, she couldnt make much of a mark in the French Open or Wimbledon.         
	She is currently playing hardcourt events in North America as preparation for the US Open, which begins later this month.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United look for domestic bliss
                                                   United look for domestic bliss
                      
	London: Manchester United appeared to be heading towards an unprecedented quintuple a month ago, but a string of lacklustre results since capturing the seasons second trophy have left the sides campaign hanging in the balance.         
	The Club World Cup and the League Cup triumphs will count for little at Old Trafford unless they are accompanied in May by the bigger prizes of the Premier League, Champions League and  to a lesser extent  the FA Cup.         
	While the Red Devils have had three days to recover from playing Aston Villa and Porto inside 50 hours, they would have preferred an easier trip Saturday than one to Sunderland, who are just one place above the relegation zone.         
	It doesnt matter what happened on Tuesday night against Porto, United manager Alex Ferguson said. Were still in the European Cup with a chance, were still in the FA Cup semi-final (against Everton) with a chance, were top of the league.         
	Tuesdays 2-2 home draw against FC Porto in the Champions League has made reaching the semi-finals of the competition a difficult task when the teams meet in the second leg next week in Portugal, while a seven-point lead in the Premier League has been slashed to a point in a month  albeit with a game in hand  over second-place Liverpool.         
	Liverpool still believe they have a chance of catching United to win their first English title in 19 years, a feat that took on additional importance after the clubs Champions League hopes were diminished by losing 1-3 at home to Chelsea in the first leg of their quarter final.         
	But with Chelsea just three points adrift in the league, midfielder Frank Lampard believes the Blues can use the impetus of the European win to climb above Liverpool, starting Saturday against Bolton.         
	Everything is still up for grabs, even though we are behind in the league, Lampard said.         
	In the struggle to avoid relegation, West Bromwich Albion are eight points from safety and bottom of the league, but north-east sides Middlesbrough and Newcastle, at 19th and 18th respectively, can still avoid dropping into the League Championship. Middlesbrough have 27 points  three more than West Brom and two fewer than Newcastle  and must beat 15th-placed Hull to revive their survival hopes. Alan Shearer takes charge of his second game at Newcastle in a tough trip to Stoke.         
	West Brom can have a big say on Portsmouths Premier League status when the two meet at Fratton Park, with Pompey four points above Newcastle. Sunderland are a point behind Pompey. West Ham will be looking to cement their grip on seventh place and likely European qualification with a victory at Tottenham, knowing that eighth-place Wigan host Arsenal at the same time. In Sundays matches, Aston Villa host Everton and Fulham are at Manchester City.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Buchanan eyes six ICL players
                                                   Buchanan eyes six ICL players
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta: John Buchanan, the Kolkata Knight Riders head of cricket operations, said on Tuesday that the beleaguered Indian Premier League (IPL) outfit is eyeing at least six players who have snapped ties with the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL) and are eligible to return to the mainstream after Tuesdays amnesty.         
	Weve shortlisted about half a dozen Indian batsmen from the ICL. Now were just waiting to hear from the IPL, he said.         
	KKR team director Joy Bhattacharjya though declined comment.         
	Incidentally, Buchanans own future does not look secure with the franchise amid reports that owner Shah Rukh Khan might sack the Aussie.         
	Buchanan, however, said: Its all under review at the moment. Theres lot of conjecture, but it will come down to what the team wants and how the owners feel. Nothing is finalised.

                                                     Tennis will miss a gentleman: Ramanathan
            A STAFF REPORTER            Premjit Lall                           
	Calcutta: Indian tennis legend Ramanathan Krishnan feels the game will miss a gentleman with the demise of Premjit Lall on Wednesday.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph from Chennai, the 71-year old said: I was shocked to hear that Premjit has passed away It is like losing a member of my family. Indian tennis will miss a fine gentleman.         
	The former Davis Cup captain described Premjit as one of the best players of his era.         
	Premjit was a product of the South Club He was great player with a glorious career Whenever I think of Premjit, I remember his match against Rod Laver He was just unplayable in that match He was hitting hard and Laver, at one point of time, struggled to get back to his normal game Although he (Premjit) lost the match, his fight will always be remembered.         
	Incidentally, Ramanathan went to meet Premjit at his residence during his recent visit to the city a couple of weeks back. I never thought he wont be among us for long. He was very jolly that day when we went on to meet him, Ramanathan said.         
	We used to call him the Gregory Peck of Indian tennis. A gentleman off the court, he was also extremely co-operative on court. Though I havent played much as he and Jaidip (Mukerjea) used to be partners, I played a few matches with him.         
	Mahesh Bhupathi, when contacted, said: Its a big loss for Indian tennis. We have lost a stalwart and his absence will always be felt.         
	Meanwhile, Premjit was cremated around noon on Thursday. Former India captain Naresh Kumar, Mukerjea and Akhtar Ali were present.

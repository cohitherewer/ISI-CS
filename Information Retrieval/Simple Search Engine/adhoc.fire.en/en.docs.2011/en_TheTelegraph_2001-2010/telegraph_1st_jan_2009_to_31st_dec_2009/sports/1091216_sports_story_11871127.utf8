The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India win battle of nerves
                                                                                                                       7                                        India win battle of nerves
    - Sehwag explodes with 146; dilshans 160 in vain; yorkers prove effective             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Virender Sehwag after his century in Rajkot, on Tuesday. (PTI)                                 
	Rajkot: Wow, what next?         
	That, indeed, was the question doing the rounds after 825 runs were scored (the second highest aggregate in an ODI) at the Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Ground, on Tuesday.         
	Clearly, the sponsors of the five-match ODI series, Karbonn Mobiles, couldnt have hoped for a better entry into cricket.         
	As for the 50-over game itself, no better advertisement would be needed.         
	So intense was the face off that Ashish Nehra, who bowled the match-clinching last six deliveries, uprooted a stump when the 1-0 lead was taken. Not to keep as a souvenir, but just to release the tension within.         
	The finish wasnt for the faint-hearted.         
	Till the last over (with Sri Lanka requiring 11 to overhaul Team Indias 414 for seven), it could have gone either way, remarked MoM Virender Sehwag.         
	Sehwag smashed a career-best 146 (102 balls, 17x4, 6x6) and featured in two hundred-plus partnerships. For a while, it seemed his superb innings would go waste, but his teammates didnt lose composure and stopped Sri Lankas astonishing challenge.         
	The visitors fell three short.         
	It was a great effort to get so close, but the boys are very disappointed... They realise that they made a few mistakes while bowling, fielding and batting, coach Trevor Bayliss said.         
	Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara raised eyebrows when he chose to field and Sehwag, who has been in excellent touch over the past month, made him regret that rather quickly.         
	Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar allowed the moisture to evaporate and, then, helped themselves to plenty. With that, Sangakkaras hopes of an early breakthrough disappeared faster than the savouries at the food stalls.         
	The opening partnership produced 153 runs, before Sachin got out (69 from 63 deliveries, 10x4, 1x6). The momentum, though, didnt suffer with Sehwag and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni collaborating 156 for the second wicket.         
	Sehwag fell on 309. Dhoni, whod promoted himself at the expense of Gautam Gambhir, cracked 72 (53 balls, 7x4, 3x6), before quickly following Sehwag.         
	The rest of the batsmen  strangely Gambhir came after Suresh Raina and specialist Virat Kohli after Harbhajan Singh  managed little, but Team Indias best was still posted.         
	On a model flat wicket, Sri Lanka missed the surprise element usually unleashed by Lasith Malinga and Muttiah Muralidharans guile.         
	However, despite conceding 414, Sri Lanka didnt look like a team which had already thrown up its hands. Rather, what followed was mind-blowing, as Tillekaratne Dilshan took centre stage for the umpteenth time this year.         
	With Upul Tharanga for company, Dilshan put on the best partnership of the day (188). The good work continued when the classy Sangakkara took Tharangas place.         
	Both Dilshan and Sangakkara batted so fluently and with such command, adding 128, that it was difficult picking who was more pleasing.         
	The Dil-scoop, for example, was played with abandon, the trademark-holder even using it to take a six off Zaheer Khan. In fact, it was mayhem from both ends with not one bowler having the courage to try something different.         
	Despite the target being as intimidating as 415.         
	Fortunately, Praveen Kumar ended Sangakkaras stay (90 from 43 deliveries, 10x4, 5x6) and, then, Harbhajan got into the act to bring the hosts right back in the thick of action.         
	Just as well.         
	Dilshan, who has grown enormously as a batsman in recent times, scored 160 before being dismissed. His stunning career-best show came in 124 balls (20x4, 3x6).         
	Nobody made a contribution of note, thereafter, and three run outs didnt help Sri Lankas cause.         
	The Indians did drop three catches, but the ground fielding was brilliant when it came to the crunch. As was the bowling at the death, by Zaheer and Nehra.         
	Both relied a lot on yorkers and that strategy worked as Sri Lanka lost a game which had been all but wrapped up.         
	Dhoni had, on the eve of the match, told The Telegraph that things could get better for him. Not that he was, in any way, unhappy with the existing state of affairs.         
	Well, how much better can it get? Dhoni reached a milestone as well, taking his tally of victims to 200.         
	Speaking exclusively, a Team India member said: We were relieved and we were overjoyed... Our emotions varied...         
	Meanwhile, Sehwag, who hurt his left knee very early in the second session, is hoping to be fit for ODI No.2, in Nagpur, on Friday.         
	The media compares me to Sachin and Viv Richards, but I dont think Im anywhere close to them... This has been my best one-day innings, though, Sehwag maintained.         
	When somebody asked if hed been batting at his best, Sehwag replied with a perfectly straight face: My best is yet to come.         
	The Nuwan Kulasekaras must have begun running for cover. Could even have begun mulling retirement.         
	Such is the Sehwag effect.

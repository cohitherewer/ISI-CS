  - BCCI not aware of the development       A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Butt                                 
	Calcutta/Karachi: Neck-deep in financial crisis, the Pakistan Cricket Board on Monday offered to play their home series in India, if the Indian government and the BCCI agree to the proposal.         
	Ratnakar Shetty, chief administrative officer of the BCCI, however, said he wasnt aware of any such offer.         
	Referring to Indias pull out from the Pakistan tour earlier this year in the wake of last years Mumbai terror attacks, PCB chairman Ijaz Butt said if the BCCI wanted to reschedule the series, with permission from the Indian government, Pakistan were ready to play their home series across the border. We are playing our home Test series in New Zealand right now, we can plan a home Test series in India as well, provided the Indians show interest, Butt said.         
	If India are willing to reschedule that series or part of that series in India, it is something we would like to discuss with them, he said. We just need to find a window next year for such a series which would I am sure be a big draw, he said.         
	Butt was candid enough to admit that PCB was finding it hard to recover the nearly $47 million loss of revenues it suffered after the cancellation of the Indian teams tour to Pakistan.         
	We are definitely keen on playing a bilateral series with India as soon as possible , Butt said.

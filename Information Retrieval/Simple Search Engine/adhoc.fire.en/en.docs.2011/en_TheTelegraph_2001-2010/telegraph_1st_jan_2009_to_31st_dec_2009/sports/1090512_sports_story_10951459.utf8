The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | David Hussey set to play vs Challengers today
                                                     David Hussey set to play vs Challengers today
            A STAFF REPORTER            David Hussey                           
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders will hope for a reversal in their fortunes when they take on the struggling Royal Challengers Bangalore in Johannesburg in their 11th Indian Premier League (IPL) match on Tuesday.         
	The Royal Challengers are currently placed a rung above the bottom-placed Knight Riders and have managed eight points from 10 matches. After enduring two successive defeats, the Bangalore side would look to bounce back.         
	The second edition of the IPL has been a nightmare for the Knight Riders to say the least. They have lost eight matches out of 10 and are reeling at the bottom of the table with three points.         
	The side, led by Brendon McCullum, will be boosted by the inclusion of Australian David Hussey in Tuesdays match.         
	Hussey had joined the squad before their last match against the Delhi DareDevils but was not included in the team. Husseys omission was a last-minute decision as he was not back at his 100 per cent, suffering from a jet lag upon arrival from Dubai.         
	But according to sources, he is absolutely fit now. Thus, it can be taken for granted that Hussey will replace Moises Henriques as the fourth foreigner of the team.         
	Medium pacer Anureet Singh, who suffered an injury earlier in the tournament, is likely to make a comeback in place of Sourav Sarkar. Anureet pulled a muscle in his right thigh in the very first over of the match against the Mumbai Indians, on April 27. Sarkar had a forgettable debut for the Knight Riders on Sunday and gave away 19 runs in 1.1 overs.         
	Consistency seems to be the worrying factor for the Bangalore side and much depends on the batting prowess of Jacques Kallis, Mark Boucher and Rahul Dravid to set things right.         
	The experienced Anil Kumble leads the bowling department and is still capable of throwing a spanner in the oppositions plan, provided he gets some support from the other end. Praveen Kumar and Dillon du Preez have had decent outings and against a faltering Knight Riders, they ought to fancy their chances.         
	Boucher played down the order to try and finish the game for us, but unfortunately it was too many runs at the end for him, Kumble said after their defeat against the Mumbai Indians on Sunday.         
	We lost too many wickets at the start and that probably was the main reason for the loss. Thats what we need to look at seriously.

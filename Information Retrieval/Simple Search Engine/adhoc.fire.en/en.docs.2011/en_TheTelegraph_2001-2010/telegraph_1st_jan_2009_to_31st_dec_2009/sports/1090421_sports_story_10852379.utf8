The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies chance to get back No.1 spot
                                                   Aussies chance to get back No.1 spot
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The five match one-day International (ODI) series between Pakistan and Australia would provide both the teams with a chance improve their ODI rankings. A clean sweep by the Aussies would be enough to take them back to the top of the ODI rankings, above current leaders South Africa.         
	A clean sweep would see them draw level with the Proteas on 126 rating points but Australia would move ahead of Graeme Smiths side when the numbers are calculated beyond the decimal point.

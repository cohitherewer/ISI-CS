	According to an ad hoc committee member, the Spanish coach, who arrived in the morning, made a presentation at the Olympic Bhawan. He will meet the IOA president on Friday, the members said.         
	The member also revealed that Brasa, who coached the Spanish womens team to gold medal in the 1992 Olympics, has already specified his demands for taking up the job.

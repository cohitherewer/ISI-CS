The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Umpire Koertzens howler claims more than one victim
                                                     Umpire Koertzens howler claims more than one victim
    - AFTER FLYING START IN CARDIFF, SETBACK FOR PONTINGS CANCER INITIATIVE				       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Umpire Rudi Koertzen (centre) confers with Billy Doctrove before (wrongly) ruling Ricky Ponting out on the second day of the second Test, at Lords, on Friday. (AFP)                                 
	Calcutta: If theres another umpiring howler which claims Ricky Ponting, like the one by seasoned Rudi Koertzen at Lords on Friday, then it wont just hurt the Australia captain and his team, but cancer-stricken children who stand to gain from the Ponting Foundations RunRickyRun initiative, as well.         
	Every Ashes run from Pontings blade is, after all, fetching a donation from companies and individuals whove pledged their support to an excellent cause.         
	The funds collected will go to two beneficiaries  the Childrens Cancer Institute Australia (CCIA), and redkite, a charity which focuses on children with cancer and their distraught families.         
	Ponting, it may be recalled, was incorrectly given out caught in the slips cordon for two by Koertzen, officiating in his 100th Test. Replays more than indicated that the bat had actually clipped his boot and not made contact with the ball.         
	Koertzen did consult on-field colleague Billy Doctrove, but its his index finger which went up, leaving Ponting shell-shocked and Australia in disarray.         
	In his only innings in the first Test, in Cardiff, Ponting had scored a superb 150. Hed, therefore, taken guard at Lords as an in-form batsman.         
	The RunRickyRun project was unveiled on May 19 by the Pontings (Ricky, Rianna and their infant daughter, Emmy), with donors having the option of contributing (AUD) 25 cents for every run or committing themselves to a fixed donation.         
	Children are our future and we have to do everything we can to win the battle against childhood cancer The work of the Foundation has become more significant for Rianna and I since Emmy was born         
	Having a beautiful healthy child of our own has given us an even greater sense of determination and resolve to support the children and families that arent as fortunate as us, Ponting said at the launch.         
	Pontings best in the passionately-followed bilateral contest has been 576 runs, at home, in 2006-07. Thats when Australia regained the Ashes, after losing it in the summer of 2005.         
	The 34-year old led from the front.         
	James Henderson, the Foundations chief executive, didnt identify the donors, but revealed that some of the Australia players too had made donations.         
	As of now, the RunRickyRun initiative is limited to the ongoing Ashes, but the initial interest has been significant and, so, we will review our position at the end of the five Tests, Henderson, who is in London, told The Telegraph on Saturday.         
	The 2009 Ashes ends with the Oval Test, from August 20.         
	Incidentally, the RunRickyRun project is also being supported by Cricket Australia as part of its Cricket Cares programme.         
	The Pontings started the Foundation after an emotional visit, in 2004, to the cancer ward of the Sydney Childrens Hospital.         
	That trip had been arranged by the CCIA.         
	Of course, the legendary Imran Khans cancer-specific work in Pakistan has been much bigger, but full marks to Ponting for the initiative he has taken.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mancini denies rift with Craig Bellamy
                                                                                                                       7                                        Mancini denies rift with Craig Bellamy
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH             Mancini                           
	Craig Bellamy, the Manchester City striker, was reported as being angry with the way Mark Hughes had been dismissed by City but new coach Roberto Mancini was keen to stress there was no rift between himself and the prickly Welshman.         
	Mancini dropped Bellamy to the bench, despite the strikers excellent form in the 2-0 win over Stoke Saturday, preferring to play the expensive and inconsistent Robinho.         
	Bellamy is my friend, he said. I spoke with him two days ago. There is no problem. I think all the players in the squad are happy. I told him we have two games in three days and I need all my players at 100 per cent. Today we played Robinho but it is possible that against Wolves we will play Craig.

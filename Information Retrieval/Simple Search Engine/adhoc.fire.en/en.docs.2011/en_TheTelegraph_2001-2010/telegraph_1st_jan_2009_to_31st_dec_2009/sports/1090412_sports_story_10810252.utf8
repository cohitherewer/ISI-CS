	London: Teenager Federico Macheda kept Manchester Uniteds title defence on track for the second straight Premier League match, clinching a 2-1 victory at Sunderland with his first touch after coming off the bench, on Saturday. Machedas goal in the 76th minute kept United top of the standings and a point ahead of Liverpool, who eased to a 4-0 victory over Blackburn.         
	Last weekend, the 17-year-old Italian scored a late winner on his debut to give United a 3-2 victory over Aston Villa.         
	Paul Scholes had put United ahead after 19 minutes, but Kenwyne Jones cancelled out the 34-year-old midfielders header in the 55th.         
	Fernando Torres scored twice to help Liverpool to their fifth straight league win. Emotions were running high at Anfield before the kickoff when a minutes silence was held to mark the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough stadium disaster, which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans.         
	United, who still have a game in hand, top the league with 71 points. Liverpool are second with 70 and Chelsea, who edged Bolton 4-3 after leading 4-0, are third on 67.         
	Buoyed by Liverpools lunchtime win, manager Rafa Benitez claimed the Red Devils were under pressure and their manager Alex Ferguson was nervous. Had it not been for Machedas winner at the Stadium of Light, Benitezs side would be top.         
	Seconds after replacing striker Dimitar Berbatov, Uniteds most expensive player, Macheda steered home a low shot by Michael Carrick that was heading wide past keeper Craig Gordon.         
	For the first 20 minutes United were cruising with Scholes and Carrick in complete control of midfield and Wayne Rooney causing Sunderland problems. The dominance was capped when Rooney cut inside and crossed for the unmarked Scholes to glance a deft header past the stranded Gordon and into the top corner.         
	After that Sunderland squandered a string of chances to equalise before Jones found the net after the break. United goalkeeper Ben Foster failed to claim Teemu Tainios cross under pressure from Jones, and the striker fired the ball into the empty net.         
	At Anfield, Torres took just five minutes to breach Blackburns five-man defence. Jamie Carragher sent a lofted pass from the halfway line and the ball was chested down by Torres, who swivelled and hooked a superb volley into the far corner.         
	In the 33rd, Torres ran unchecked from the far corner of the penalty area and beat Blackburns Chris Samba in the air to head home Xabi Alonsos cross. Daniel Agger ensured a comfortable finish by running from 40 metres out and blasting a swerving shot past Paul Robinson in the 83rd and David Ngog nodded in Lucas Leivas header across the face of goal in the 90th.         
	The emphatic victory meant that midfielder Steven Gerrard, who is struggling with a groin problem, could remain on the bench. Benitez hopes his captain will be fit to play at Chelsea in the second leg of their Champions League match as Liverpool looks to recover a 3-1 deficit.         
	Chelsea were 4-0 up after 63 minutes thanks to two goals from Didier Drogba, a penalty converted by Frank Lampard and Michael Ballacks first league goal of the season. But after coach Guus Hiddink replaced Drogba with Nicolas Anelka and Lampard with Deco in the 65th minute, Bolton fought back.         
	Bolton scored three times in 11 minutes through Andy Brien, Chris Basham and Matt Taylor. Gary Cahill was only denied a stoppage time winner when Deco cleared off the line.         
	Arsenal went nine points clear of Aston Villa in the fourth Champions League spot after coming from behind to win 4-1 win at Wigan.         
	After Midos early goal, Arsenal stormed back after the break with goals from Theo Walcott, Mikael Silvestre, Andrei Arshavin and Alex Song.

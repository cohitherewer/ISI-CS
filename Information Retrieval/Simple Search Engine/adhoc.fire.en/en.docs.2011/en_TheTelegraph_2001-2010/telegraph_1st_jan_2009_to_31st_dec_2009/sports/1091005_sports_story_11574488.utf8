                                                     Rest in cruise control 
          
	Nagpur: Rest of India (RoI) continued in the drivers seat, reaching 352 for four in their second innings against Mumbai thanks to Abhinav Mukunds fine knock of 126 before rain and bad light played spoilsport on the fourth day in the Irani Trophy here Sunday.         
	The fury of the elements led to the loss of the crucial final session but RoI still look good to force a win after having taken an overall lead of 382 runs.         
	Manoj Tiwary was going strong on 80 with Wriddhiman Saha (5) when bad light forced an early tea.         
	The post-tea session could not be resumed as the heavens opened up and the umpires finally called off days play.         
	Mukund, who resumed the day on 86, got enough time to complete his seventh first-class hundred before falling, in the morning session, to Ramesh Powar after a 250-ball stay at the crease. He moved towards the century when he clipped Dhawal Kulkarni off his pads to deep square leg boundary.         
	Murali Vijay, however, missed out on his hundred becoming the first to depart for 91 (211 balls; 10X4) when he fell to Iqbal Abdulla. On 79, he was dropped by Vinayak Samant off Dhawal Kulkarni.         
	S. Badrinath and Manoj did not let the tempo drop as they shared a 78-run partnership for the third wicket from 31 overs before the former got out in the post-lunch session. Ravindra Jadeja (3) could not contribute much but Manoj was in good nick to extend RoIs lead.         
	Persistent drizzle brought about an early end to the first session and returned later to force the umpires to call for tea early. RoI captain Virender Sehwag was seen padded up to come out in the middle as the next batsman.         
	But the India opener will not bat if he decides to declare RoIs innings overnight to give a full days play to his bowlers to dismiss Mumbai assuming play is possible Monday.For Mumbai, Pawar and Abdulla took two apiece for 78 and 96 runs respectively.         
	Meanwhile, RoIs Sreesanth was Sunday docked 60 per cent of his match fees for his verbal spat with Mumbai pacer Dhawal Kulkarni on the second day of the ongoing Irani Trophy.         
	Sreesanth was found guilty of using offensive, obscene language/gestures, which fall below acceptable standards under clause 2.8 of Level II offence of the BCCI guidelines. Match referee K.P. Bhaskar held a formal hearing this afternoon before announcing his verdict.         
	If found guilty of any further breach in the code of conduct in future, the maverick Kerala pacer will attract Level III offence which could lead to a ban of minimum two to maximum five matches, Bhaskar said.         
	Kulkarni was also charged under clause 1.4 of Level I for instigating and wrongfully accusing the opposition bowler and brining the game to a halt.         
	He, however, was let off after being reprimanded and an official warning.           (PTI)

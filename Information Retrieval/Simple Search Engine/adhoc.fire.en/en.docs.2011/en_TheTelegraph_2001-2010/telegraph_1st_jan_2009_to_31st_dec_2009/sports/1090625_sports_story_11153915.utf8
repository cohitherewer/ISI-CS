The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians did not want to play us, says Afridi
                                                     Indians did not want to play us, says Afridi
                  Afridi                     
	Karachi: Senior pro and the man who is tipped to lead Pakistan in Twenty20, Shahid Afridi, on Wednesday alleged that Team India were reluctant to play against Pakistan in the World T20 and it showed in their attitude.         
	Even though the archrivals did not meet in the tournament, and couldnt have unless it was in the final, they featured in a sold-out warm-up match. Afridi has now said that Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men did not seem keen to play Pakistan even though they claimed they were eager to.         
	I was a bit disappointed. It didnt appear to me by the attitude of the Indian players that they wanted to play against us, Afridi told a Pakistan television channel.         
	On the face, they said they would like to see cricket between the two countries but I think in their hearts they thought otherwise. Their attitude and behaviour while playing against us showed this, Afridi said.         
	Pakistan and India have frozen bilateral cricket ties since the Mumbai terror attack last November with the Indians cancelling a scheduled tour earlier this year.         
	Afridi said he still believed that cricket could heal ties between the two nations and bring people together.         
	I always say use sports to foster good relations and remove misunderstandings, Afridi said.         
	He said Pakistan had proven critics wrong by winning the World T20 when everyone had tipped India and South Africa as favourites.         
	I think our performance is a lesson for other teams. We are world champions and I hope teams will now come to Pakistan.         
	Afridi, who dedicated his inspiring performances in the World T20 triumph to victims of the conflict in his troubled nation, said that the short gap between the just-completed World T20 and next years edition has robbed Pakistan of full enjoyment of their triumph.         
	I fail to understand why the next World Cup will be played in nine months time, Afridi said.         
	If its organised after two years, people would have remembered Pakistans victory and it would have been more enjoyable.         
	It should have been scheduled a bit later, but cricket is no more a sport, its becoming a business everywhere.           (AGENCIES)

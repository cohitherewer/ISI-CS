	Roseau (Dominica): Fast bowler Kemar Roach claimed five wickets for 44 on Sunday as the West Indies restricted Bangladesh to 246 for nine off 50 overs in the opening one-day International at Windsor Park.               
	At midnight, West Indies were 27 for three after eight overs               
	Bangladesh stand-in skipper Shakib-al Hasan (54) and Mohammed Ashraful (57) stroked half-centuries to lift the visitors after they lost the toss and were sent in to bat. All-rounder Mahmudullah also chipped in with 42 off 39 balls.         
	Roach gave the home team an electric start in the inaugural international at Windsor Park, gaining Tamim Iqbals edge to the wicketkeeper with the first ball of the match.         
	But Ashraful and Junaid Siddique soon dulled the local fans enthusiasm with a second-wicket stand of 74. Siddique forged 36 off 47 balls with three fours before he lofted medium pacer David Bernard (Jr) to mid-off.         
	Roach returned to dispatch Raqibul Hasan (12) at 97 for three in the 34th over.         
	Ashraful passed 50 off 83 balls with five fours but was hampered by an injury and fell soon afterwards via a run out. The diminutive right-hander was too slow to beat West Indies captain Floyd Reifers pinpoint return from cover.         
	Bangladesh were struggling when Mushfiqur Rahim (11) slapped to backward point off Rawl Lewis at 149 for five.         
	But Shakib and Mahmudullah, two stars of Bangladeshs success in the preceding Test series, added 79 off 66 balls to boost their side. Mahmudullah provided the runs by launching two fours and two sixes.

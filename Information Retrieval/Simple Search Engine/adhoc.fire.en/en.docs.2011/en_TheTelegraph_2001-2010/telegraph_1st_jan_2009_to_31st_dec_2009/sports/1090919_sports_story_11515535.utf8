The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australia regain No.1 spot
                                                   Australia regain No.1 spot
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Australia have regained the top spot in Reliance Mobile ICC ODI Championship, after going 6-0 up with one match to play in the ODI series in England.         
	Ricky Pontings side beat the home team by 111 runs at Trent Bridge on Thursday, and in the process, moved ahead of South Africa by a fraction of a ratings point.         
	But they need to win the last ODI to stay atop, and head into the ICC Champions Trophy as the No.1 team in the world. If they lose the third ODI, they will slip to the third spot, according to an International Cricket Council release.         
	As a result of Australias rise, India have dropped to third, while England stay seventh, three ratings points behind New Zealand in sixth.         
	The ICC Champions Trophy 2009 gets underway in South Africa on September 22, and with just a single ratings point separating Australia in the first position from India in third place.

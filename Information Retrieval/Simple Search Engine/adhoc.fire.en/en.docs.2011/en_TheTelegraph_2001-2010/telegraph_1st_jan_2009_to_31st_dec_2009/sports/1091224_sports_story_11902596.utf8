	Guwahati/Mysore: A buoyant Karnataka would strive to continue their unbeaten journey in the Ranji Trophy when they take on a confident Punjab in a quarter final match commencing Thursday at the Gangothri Glades cricket ground here.         
	Karnataka have performed magnificently right through the league phase and topped the Group B with 28 points from six outings.         
	On the other hand, Punjab have qualified for the final-eight stage from Group A after finishing second, behind Tamil Nadu, in the league stage and would undoubtedly be a hard nut to crack.         
	Return of Rahul Dravid has bolstered Karnatakas batting order which has never been so consistent over the last eight seasons.         
	Manish Pandey has amassed 553 runs including two centuries so far in the tournament and Karnataka would expect another responsible performance from him.         
	Besides, Ganesh Satish, KB Pawan and Amit Verma have been the mainstay of the bristling Karnataka batting order.         
	Led by seasoned Pankaj Dharmani, Punjab on the other hand, depend a lot on the pace duo of Manpreet Gony and Love Ablish, both have the potential to spoil Karnatakas plans.         
	Meanwhile, a resurgent Delhi will have to play out of their skin to upset Tamil Nadus apple cart when the two teams cross swords in the second quarter final match in Delhi.         
	Topping group A with 26 points, Tamil Nadu have been invincible so far and clearly start as the hot favourites, even though the visitors would be without skipper Dinesh Karthik who is busy doing national duty.         
	In contrast, Delhi had suffered an innings defeat to Uttar Pradesh. Although the team, coached by Vijay Dahiya, did well to reach the quarter finals, it will be tough road ahead for them.         
	In another quarter final, Mumbai will have the upperhand when they take on Haryana in Lahli.         
	For Assam it is going to be a fresh start when they take on Uttar Pradesh in the fourth Ranji Trophy quarter final encounter at the NF Railway Stadium in Guwahati.         
	After qualifying for the elite group beating Andhra by five wickets in the Plate Group semi-finals last week, Assam are now not only looking forward to a win but also for the right exposure to prepare themselves for the super league next year.         
	Speaking about the playing XI, captain Amol Muzumdar refused to comment but coach Subhrajit Saikia said there could be a couple of changes taking into account the conditions.         
	He, however, hinted that Assam might field a batsman or an all-rounder in place of a pacer on what appears to be a flat track.         
	Rishav Das has replaced wicket-keeper-batsman Rajdeep Das, who has been suffering from chest congestion.

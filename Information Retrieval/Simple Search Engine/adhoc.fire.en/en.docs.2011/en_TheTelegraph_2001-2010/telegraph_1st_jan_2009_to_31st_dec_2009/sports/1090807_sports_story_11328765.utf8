	Leeds: England will not know whether Andrew Flintoff will be fit enough to play in the fourth Ashes Test against Australia at Headingley on Friday until the morning of the match, according to captain Andrew Strauss.         
	Flintoff, who announced last month he is retiring from Test matches after the Ashes series because of an injury to his right knee, bowled gingerly in practice for 36 minutes Thursday morning.         
	Although Flintoffs opinion on whether he will be fit to play will be taken into account, the final decision will be taken by Strauss and coach Andy Flower.         
	We have to take the players point of view on board because he knows his body better than anyone, Strauss told reporters on Thursday. We will also speak to the medical people but ultimately its the decision of me and the coach.         
	He did a fair amount of bowling today and he got the ball through but he didnt look like he was (bowling) at 100 per cent. Its not about what he did in the nets today but more about how much swelling there is on his knee the day after, Strauss said.         
	Flintoff, 31, was Man of the Match at Lords for his bowling performance that helped give England a 1-0 lead they still hold in the five-match series.         
	He was hoping to play all five Tests before bowing out to play only limited-overs cricket because his body can no longer stand up to the rigors of the five-day format. If he does not make Fridays game, he will hope for a swansong Test at The Oval on August 20.         
	The influential all-rounder scored an explosive 74 from 79 balls in the third Test that ended as a draw at Edgbaston Monday, but he did not take a wicket from his 40 overs in the match, on a slow pitch that did not help his short, fast bowling.         
	Strauss acknowledged so much attention on Flintoffs fitness is not ideal while preparing for a match that could see England regain the Ashes if they win in Leeds.         
	He understands the importance of the player to the team, though, but says he wont allow sentiment about Flintoffs farewell to distract him from picking the right team.         
	Its not an ideal situation but thats the situation we are in and if he is fit we will desperately want him to play but if he is not fit to play it wouldnt be right for us to pick him, Strauss said.         
	When you are captain of a team you are motivated by what is right for the team. We cant make a decision on sentimental grounds. And the last thing he would want is to play and then not be able to play a full part in the game.         
	Flintoff has so far played 78 Test matches in an 11-year career. He has been plagued by injury since 2005. (AP)

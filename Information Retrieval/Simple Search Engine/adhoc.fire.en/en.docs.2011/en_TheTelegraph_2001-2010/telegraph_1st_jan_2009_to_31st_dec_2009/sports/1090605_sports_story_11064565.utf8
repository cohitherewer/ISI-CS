The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Already at Tussauds, but Sachin debut awaited
                                                     Already at Tussauds, but Sachin debut awaited
  - Family in tow, Master blasters UK visit to coincide with World T20       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin at the unveiling of his wax statue in Mumbai                                 
	Nottingham: Sachin Tendulkar, the first Indian sportsman to have his wax statue placed at Madame Tussauds, will (believe it or not) be making his first visit to the landmark London address, on Marylebone Road, on his forthcoming trip to the UK.         
	Ive never been to Madame Tussauds... So, it will be a first for me when my family and I visit the museum on our trip to London, Sachin told The Telegraph, on the eve of leaving Mumbai.         
	Of course, Ive already posed with the almost life-like wax creation, but Ill probably feel different once I see it in the midst of some of the biggest names from all walks of life, Sachin added.         
	Sachin will be in the UK for less than three weeks, almost all of it coinciding with the World T20. Son Arjun is likely to decide on the matches that the family should watch.         
	Incidentally, Sachin confirmed that one of the national selectors had very informally asked him during the recent IPL (in South Africa) whether hed review his decision of not playing T20 for the country.         
	There was nothing official about it... I reiterated that our T20 team had a settled look and I just didnt wish to disturb it... Thats it, Sachin said.         
	Sachin, wholl complete 20 years at the international level in November, wont be seen in the India colours till the four-match ODI series in the West Indies, to be held between June 26-July 5.

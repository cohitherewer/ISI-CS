The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting is Williams role model captain
                                                     Ponting is Williams role model captain
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Porterfield                           
	Nottingham: Ricky Ponting can take heart from something at least: Hes William Porterfields role model captain.         
	Yeah, Pontings a role model for me... I like the way he stays calm and doesnt get flustered, the Ireland captain told The Telegraph.         
	Porterfield added: In the years gone by, I would admire Steve Waugh and Michael Vaughan... Both would also be so calm, never allowing the pressure to get the better of them.         
	The 24-year-old, incidentally, is one of the few full-time professionals in the Ireland team and has been captaining for over a year.

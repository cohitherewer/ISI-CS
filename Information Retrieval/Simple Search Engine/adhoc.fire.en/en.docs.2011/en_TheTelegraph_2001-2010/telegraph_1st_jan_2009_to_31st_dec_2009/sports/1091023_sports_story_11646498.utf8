                                                   Tim Nielsen: Pressure affecting   Ishant game
                            
	Melbourne: Australian coach Tim Nielsen feels struggling Indian pacer Ishant Sharma was bound to go through the lean phase he is currently enduring as he has been forced to lead the bowling attack too early in his career.         
	Sharmas an example of young players when they do start well theres expectation on them the whole way through, they find it difficult, they become targeted by opposition teams, Nielsen was quoted as saying by an Australian daily.         
	Rather than being the second or third fast bowler in the group, you all of a sudden become the one everyones very aware of.         
	They havent had Zaheer Khan playing for them for the last little while through injury, so hes had to take on a leadership mantle. All those things add up to mean more responsibility and more pressure, he said.         
	India and Australia start a seven-match ODI series from Sunday in Vadodara and Ishants lean patch is a concern for Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	The 21-year-old speedster, who came across as an exciting talent when he first burst into the international stage, is miserably out of form currently, coming a cropper at last months Champions Trophy.         
	Nielsen said Ishants poor form could be one of the reasons why the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) sacked bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad and fielding coach Robin Singh.         
	That may be one of the reasons why theyve changed their staff, trying to spark a bit of a change of message or voice to their younger players who mightve gone a little off the boil over the last little while, Nielsen said.         
	Prasad and Singh were with the Indian team since 2007 but never got a formal contract.         
	The two were sacked after the teams Champions Trophy debacle with the BCCI issuing just a one-line statement to confirm their ouster.         
	Nielsen said such sackings make it seem that the Indian Board was looking for a scapegoat.         
	When you have a result like (India) did in the ICC Champions Trophy and then you lose some staff at that time, it always looks like theyre the ones whove been made the scapegoats, so its unfortunate for them and something theyll have to deal with in the next little while, he said.         
	From our perspective, one of the things we try to maintain with our staffing and the way we approach it is that were aiming and wanting to win and preparing as such for every series we play in.

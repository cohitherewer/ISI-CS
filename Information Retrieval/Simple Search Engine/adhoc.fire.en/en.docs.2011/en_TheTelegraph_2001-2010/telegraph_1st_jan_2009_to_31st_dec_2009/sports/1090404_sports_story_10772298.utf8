	Durban: Michael Hussey returned to form Friday to hit 83 not out off 79 balls and steer Australia to 286 for seven wickets in the first one-day International against South Africa.         
	Hussey, who has struggled against the Proteas in recent home and away Test series, ran out Brad Haddin for 53 just eight balls after coming to the crease. But he then put on stands of 53 with Callum Ferguson (25) and 67 with James Hopes (38) at Kingsmead to steady the Aussie innings.         
	Hussey smashed six boundaries and two sixes and helped add 53 in the final batting Powerplay.           (AGENCIES)

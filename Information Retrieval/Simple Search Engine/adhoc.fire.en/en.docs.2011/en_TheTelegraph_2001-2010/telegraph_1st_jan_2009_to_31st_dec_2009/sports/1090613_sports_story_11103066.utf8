The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania enters semi-finals
                                                     Sania enters semi-finals
          
	Birmingham: Sania Mirzas impressive run at the Aegon Classic continued as the Indian ace sealed a semi-final berth beating 16th seed Hungarian Melinda Czink in straight sets here Friday.         
	The unseeded Indian survived some anxious moments in the dying minutes of the match before pulling off a 6-1, 7-6(7-4) in the quarter finals of the $220,000 WTA event.         
	Sania went ahead by breaking Melinda at love in the fourth game. The Hungarian double faulted and Sania pounced on the first chance and held next game to surge to a 4-1 lead. Melinda struggled with her serve and a flurry of double faults helped Sanias cause as she capitalised on her rivals errors to get one more break in the sixth game to serve out the set.         
	The double fault bug bit the Indian in the second set as she committed two in the fourth game to hand a 3-1 lead to the Hungarian Czink. In the next game Sania converted the second breakpoint and held her serve in the next to make it 3-3.         
	Sania broke Melinda in the ninth game to create that little vital gap but squandered a match point in the next game to allow Melinda achieve parity.         
	Again she survived a few anxious moments in the 12th game before stretching it to a tie-breaker, where she outplayed her rival to make the next round. With this win Sania also equalled the win-loss record against Melinda at 1-1 as she had lost her first match against the Hungarian when the two had clashed in Calcutta in 2005.

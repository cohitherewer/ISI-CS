The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Came alive in second half: Subhas
                                                   Came alive in second half: Subhas
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick said he had expected a hard battle against Mohammedan Sporting in the I-League match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.         
	I told my players yesterday that we can lose this match. Post-February 22, we have not been able to prepare the way I would have liked to. The first half was disastrous and we were punished for that. We showed our true colours in the second and had the character to come back strongly, Subhas said. Rallying to hold a team after being 2 goals down inside the first 30 minutes is no joke, he added.         
	Refusing to elaborate on what occurred at half-time in their dressing room, Subhas said that once the flanks became active, East Bengal started to dictate terms. The wing-play in the second half was really satisfying. And our defence also stopped trying silly things.         
	Subhas rued the fact that his team could not log full points. We missed a couple of sitters in the first half and, then in the second, luck was not with us. We deserved full points, he said.         
	Subhas said he was not worried about the fact that Yusif Yakubu would be missing the Mahindra United match in the next round. Yakubu will serve a two-match ban for a double yellow.         
	Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali said it was a perfect case of so-near-yet-so far. Failing to win after being 2-0 up is demoralising. But I am seeing the brighter side. We have a point from this match, he said.         
	Shabbir was candid enough to admit that Mohammedan Sporting could have lost the match. Given our limited resources we could have ended up with nothing. But our boys had the guts to stop them, he said.

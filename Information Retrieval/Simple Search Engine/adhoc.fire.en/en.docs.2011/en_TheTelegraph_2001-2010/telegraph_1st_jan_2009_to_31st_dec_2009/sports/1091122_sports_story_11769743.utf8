The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Manjrekar hits out at flat tracks
                                                                                                                       7                                      Manjrekar hits out at flat tracks
                      
	New Delhi: Disappointed with the tame draw in the Ahmedabad Test between India and Sri Lanka, former batsman Sanjay Manjrekar said placid wickets, like in Motera, are a serious threat to Test crickets progress.         
	The first Test match at the Sardar Patel Stadium in Motera, ended in a draw Friday after around 1600 runs were scored on the shirtfront of a wicket.         
	I think no sport is so dictated by the track on which it is played on. If we continue to encourage the curators by calling their flat tracks good wickets, then we are seriously hampering the progress of Test cricket, Manjrekar said.         
	The last thing that Test cricket needs in present times is a sport that is played over five days, around seven hours a day, and ending in a no result.         
	In todays day and age it looks completely outdated and the concept will not at all appeal to the younger generation, he added.         
	Manjrekar feels India and Sri Lanka didnt have the bowling attack to pick 20 wickets and their cause was not helped by an overtly batting-friendly pitch.           (PTI)

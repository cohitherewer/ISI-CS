	Gros Islet: Ramnaresh Sarwans half-century helped the West Indies register 185 for seven off 27 overs in the rain-truncated third one-day International against India at the Beausejour Stadium on Friday. With Duckworth-Lewis coming into the picture, Indias target was revised to 195.               
	India were 45 for no loss after six overs. Gautam Gambhir (14) and Dinesh Karthik (27) were at the crease.               
	The hosts braved the stop-start game, which witnessed as many as four rain interruptions, to post a competitive total after India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni won the toss and opted to field.         
	Sarwan (62) was involved in two crucial partnerships, 51 runs with Runako Morton (22) and another 48 with Shivnarine Chanderpaul (15) before he was run out .         
	Gautam Gambhirs strong throw found Sarwan short of the mark. His 58-ball stay included five fours and a six.         
	He carried on the momentum provided by captain Chris Gayle (27), who gave the hosts a rollicking start after the match started two hours and five minutes late following a rain delay that first reduced the match to 41 overs a side.         
	Gayle hit Ishant Sharma for a couple of boundaries in each of his first two overs.         
	Ashish Nehra received similar treatment in his second over, another couple of boundaries, before rain intervened with the West Indies at 27 for no loss from 3.3 overs.         
	Play resumed after a 15-minute delay but the distraction was enough to unsettle the West Indies captain, who departed chasing a widish delivery from Nehra. He slashed the first ball after resumption and Dhoni did the rest behind stumps. His 14-ball stay at the crease had six hits to the fence.         
	Morton (22), who was a silent spectator till then, was joined by Sarwan and the duo took the score to 56 for one from 9.1 overs before rain intervened for a third time.

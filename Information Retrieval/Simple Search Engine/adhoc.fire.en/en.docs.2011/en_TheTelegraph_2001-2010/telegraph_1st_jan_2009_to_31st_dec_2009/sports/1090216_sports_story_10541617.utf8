                                                     Perfect 10 but a flawed show
    - Md. Sp. give league leaders a run for money           A STAFF REPORTER            L. James Singh of Mohun Bagan (centre) celebrates with Jose Ramirez Barreto (right) and Habibur Rahman during their I-League match against Mohammedan Sporting at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: It was a perfect 10 for Mohun Bagan but even an ardent fan would not like the way it came. Karim Bencharifas boys clung on to James Singhs 14th minute strike against a distinctly unlucky Mohammedan Sporting to record their 10th consecutive win in the I-League at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday.         
	Now with 33 points from 15 matches, Bagan are two ahead of Sporting Clube de Goa who, after their 1-0 win against Churchill Brothers in Margao earlier in the day, have 31 from 15.         
	Mohun Bagan never looked so pedestrian and it was all the more glaring in the floodlit stadium. They were inconsistent in building moves, lacked their usual consummate conviction in front of the goal, and were unusually coy in the centre of the park.         
	That they managed to log full points was more due to the profligacy of the Mohammedan Sporting striking duo of Mike Okoro and Suraj Mondal than anything else.         
	Agreed that Okoro and Mondal combined well, the latter in particular was a constant thorn in Bagans flesh with his explosive pace and brilliant step-overs, but the good work came to nought.         
	If Okoro was guilty of missing some chances  the easiest came midway through the first half when he volleyed wide from close after Mondal set him up inside the penalty box  Suraj headed straight to an onrushing Sangram Mukherjee from sniffing distance of the target at the hour mark.         
	May be it wasnt Mohammedan Sportings day, otherwise their unbeaten record this season against their financially stronger rivals would have remained intact. And who knows with a little bit of luck even the Rs 1 lakh incentive that Mohammedan Sporting officials announced could have gone to the players.         
	Mohun Bagan have a tendency of going into a shell every time they come up against muscle power in the midfield.         
	 It happened once again on Sunday as Eugene Gray and Adebayor Adewusis physical strength was too much to handle for Marcos Pereira and Rakesh Masih.         
	With the Brazilian, one of the revelations for Bagan in the ongoing campaign, failing to pull the strings from the midfield, and James Singh kept silent by Rajib Ghosh, Bhaichung Bhutia and Jose Ramirez Barreto did not have the respect they generally command in the rivals defensive third. Even Ishfaq Ahmed was wayward with his deliveries from the flanks.         
	Still Bhaichung and Barreto created some chances, in tandem with Ishfaq, but some dogged defending by Sheikh Azim, Wasim Feroz and Gurpreet Singh nullified their attempts.         
	The frail-looking Azim, in particular, was a picture of confidence in the back-four. He denied Bhaichung and Barreto their place under the light by throwing his body in front of the goal.         
	And he almost got his name on the scoresheet, but, unfortunately, his header off an Okoro free-kick went over from close just before half-time.         
	The all-important goal came in a bizarre way. Peter Odafes throw-in was played by Barreto on to James Singh whose speculative low right-footer took a wicked deflection off Gurpreet Singh and nestled into the net. Goalkeeper Naseem Akhtar, who had an otherwise good day in office, could only watch helplessly.         
	Despite the loss Mohammedan Sporting should take a lot of positives from this match. Okoro and Mondal are developing a good understanding and it will be good for Shabbir Alis team if Okoro guides this youngster.         
	Their next stop is Mumbai where they meet Mahindra United and if they repeat Sundays performance, victory is not something impossible. After all, it is not every day that a better team finish losers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mumbai FC take on Churchill
                                                   Mumbai FC take on Churchill
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                            
	Mumbai: Mumbai FC will have their task cut out when they take on title contenders Churchill Brothers at the Cooperage here on Sunday.         
	David Booths men have been impressive in their debut season in the I-League but face an unenviable task of containing Okolie Odafe.         
	The 24-year-old has been nothing but prolific with 21 goals this season, highlighted by a double hattrick against Vasco last month.         
	Mumbai FC have a chance to leap ahead of city rivals Mahindra United to fourth position but would be handicapped by the loss of defender Anes Edathodika due to double booking.

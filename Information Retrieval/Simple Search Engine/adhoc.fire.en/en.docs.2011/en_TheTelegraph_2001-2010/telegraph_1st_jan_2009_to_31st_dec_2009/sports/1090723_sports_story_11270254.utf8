The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Favourites disappoint again
                                                                                                               Favourites disappoint again 
            STAR RACER                                    
	Calcutta: Punters had little to cheer about in Wednesdays six-event card. Much like the opening day, last Wednesday, favourites fell like nine pins as rain ruled the turf throughout the afternoon. However, jockey C. Alford and trainer Vijay Singh reacted differently to the prevailing conditions. They combined to notch up a quick trophy-double through Alterity and Absolutely Royal, the winners of their respective events  the Goldliner Cup and the Citi Limits Cup, both over 1,400 meters.          
	The 9-2 second favourite Alterity, however, returned an easy winner as Alford out-witted his four rivals, taking the five-year-old to a start to-finish mission. The hot-favourite Absolutely Royal, on the other hand, was hard-pressed to beat Glory Of North when ridden in a check.

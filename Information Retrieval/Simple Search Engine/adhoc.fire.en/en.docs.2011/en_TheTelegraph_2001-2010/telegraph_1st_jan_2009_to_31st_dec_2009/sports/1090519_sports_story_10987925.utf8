The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhaichung   finds sympathy
                                                   Bhaichung   finds sympathy
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Football administrators and coaches all over the country have openly sympathised with Bhaichung Bhutia saying the manner in which the Mohun Bagan captain was treated by his club was unfair and that the striker definitely deserved better.         
	The striker has sparked speculation as to his destination now following Mondays announcement that he wants to quit Bagan.         
	While the people The Telegraph spoke to were unanimous that Bhaichung, for all his 32 years, was an asset, it was Dempos Armando Colaco who seemed most excited at the prospect of having Bhaichung in his line-up.         
	Sunil Chetri, the India forward has signed for Dempo in the coming season.         
	Here is what they (in alphabetical order) had to say:         
	Armando Colaco, secretary and coach, Dempo SC: Bhaichung was pushed to a corner by Mohun Bagan. They forced him to leave the club.         
	It is unfair. After all, he is one of the best players of his time and an icon of Indian football.         
	Players should be treated with more respect.         
	We are ready to recruit Bhaichung for our club. If he approaches our club and we agree on terms and conditions we will definitely take him. Our team will be strengthened. We know how to respect a player.         
	R.A.J. Gomes, secretary, Salgaocar: Whatever has happened with Bhaichung is wrong. He has dedicated long years to his country and has served his club well. He should not have been treated like this.         
	As far as recruiting him is concerned, had this happened a month ago we would have seriously considered approaching him but since our squad for the season has been finalised we are in no position to take any players.         
	Sukhwinder Singh, coach, JCT: What happened with Bhaichung is unfortunate. I dont blame him for refusing to play for Bagan.         
	The situation was such that he was left with no other option. It is a good decision since the relationship has gone sour.         
	I dont think we are going to approach Bhaichung to play for our club. Our team budget is relatively low. We may not be able to afford a highly paid footballer like him. My best wishes, however, are always with him.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SRK awaits feedback
                                                     SRK awaits feedback
  - Mehta is on a mission in SA       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Buchanan is under a lot of pressure                                 
	Calcutta: Jay Mehta, the Kolkata Knight Riders co-owner, isnt on a holiday in South Africa. In fact, he has been deputed by principal malik Shah Rukh Khan to get a first-hand feedback from the franchises players and support staff.         
	Irrespective of Wednesdays result, in the Knights final league match, against the Rajasthan Royals in Durban, the franchise will end IPL 2009 at the bottom of the table.         
	Last year, the Knights had finished sixth (third from the bottom).         
	Mehta has a clear brief... As Shah Rukh didnt go back to South Africa, Mehta is acting as his eyes and ears... Its understood that Shah Rukh will be briefed on all matters once the edition ends, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	As part of Operation Feedback, Mehta has already spent considerable time with captain Brendon McCullum. He has also had one-on-ones with some players.         
	Mehtas most important meeting could well be the one behind closed doors with the support staff, either on Thursday evening or Friday morning, in Johannesburg.         
	Head of cricket operations John Buchanan, coach Matthew Mott and team director Joy Bhattacharjya will (among others) be present.         
	That, indeed, is going to be the real stock-taking exercise and Mehtas own feedback to Shah Rukh after that may be very crucial for certain individuals, Buchanan included, the well-placed source added.         
	As reported last week, drastic steps arent ruled out.         
	Meanwhile, left-arm spinner Murali Kartik is unlikely to play against the Royals. Back spasms have limited his mobility and hes in pain.         
	If the Knights team management decides to finally give Charl Langeveldt a game, then the XI wont have a specialist spinner as the South African quick can only take the place of Ajantha Mendis.         
	After all, McCullum, the in-form Brad Hodge and David Hussey will be occupying three of the four berths for overseas players.         
	The Knights XI on Monday, which forced a superb last-ball win over the Chennai Super Kings in Centurion, included nine with the ability to bowl. The make-up is set to be different on Wednesday.         
	For the Royals, the defending champions, its a must-win match. The first encounter between the two, last month, had seen the Royals get full points in a Super Over-finish.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England still before IPL, says Flintoff
                                                                                                                       7                                      England still before IPL, says Flintoff
                      
	London: Andrew Flintoff might have turned a freelancer but the talented all-rounder said his passion to play for England is still intact and he would never choose to play cash-rich twenty20 events like the Indian Premier League over England.         
	I would never turn down England... I have shown more than enough passion over the years, and thats not something you lose because I dont have a contract, Flintoff said.         
	If I didnt think I was going to play for England again, I would not have had this latest operation, no way. It is all about playing for England, he added.         
	My intentions are to play every one-day and Twenty20 game for England. It is never going to be a case of picking and choosing.         
	I want to play for England and Lancashire. Ive got my contract with the Chennai Super Kings and now I have the opportunity to play around the world as well.         
	Im really keen to play in Australia, which has always been an ambition of mine. When Im fit again, I would love to play in their Big Bash Twenty20 competition, he added.         
	Flintoff hoped this break would help him to rejuvenate so that he can play his best ever cricket. (PTI)

                                                   Have to win league for Real, says   Ronaldo

	Cristiano Ronaldo has said he has absolutely no regrets about leaving Manchester United for Real Madrid.         
	The winger, currently only a couple of hundred miles across the Irish Sea at Reals pre-season training camp near Dublin, also admitted that after having unprecedented sums of money spent on them this summer, the new players at Madrid need to live up to their billing in the coming season and help the club to the domestic league title.         
	The winger, who became the most expensive player in football when Real bought him for 80 million, stressed that it was a difficult decision to leave United, but maintained that after spending a week with his new club, which has included training three times a day, he believes he has made the correct move.         
	Having achieved all he could in England, it is time for a new challenge feels Ronaldo.         
	It was not an easy situation, he said. I arrived at United when I was 18 years-old, and I have been there for six years.         
	It is a long time, and I won many things there, both collectively and individually. I met very good people, good friends, so it is not easy, but life is a challenge, and I think it is a good move. I am very proud to be here, it is a top group. I hope to be as happy here as I was at United.         
	Those six years seems to have instilled a greater degree of loyalty than the effect that two seasons at Old Trafford had on Carlos Tevez.         
	Asked whether he had considered crossing the Manchester divide to join City, like Tevez, Ronaldos reply was simple: Never.         
	But that does not mean Ronaldo will be overly bothered about events in the Premier League next season.         
	City are trying to build a nice team, they have bought a few good players, but that is not my problem, he said.         
	It is a problem for United, for Chelsea, for Arsenal. I have to concentrate on my team. I dont care what City are going to do.

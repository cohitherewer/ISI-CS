	Liverpool: Fernando Torres sparked the end of Liverpools four-game losing streak in a stormy Anfield clash that saw Nemanja Vidic and Javier Mascherano sent off.         
	Second-half goals from Torres and an injury-time David Ngog strike moved Liverpool to within four points of champions Manchester United.         
	But the game was marred by the dismissals of Vidic  his third in successive games against Liverpool  and Mascherano, who both saw red for two yellow cards.         
	Jamie Carragher was fortunate not to be sent off when receiving only a yellow card for fouling Michael Owen as the last defender on 87 minutes.         
	But as United chased an injury-time equaliser, Ngog sealed victory for Liverpool with a cool finish past Edwin van der Sar.         
	With captain Steven Gerrard unable to shake off a groin strain in time for the game, Liverpool were forced to tackle the champions with their most influential player sat in the stands.         
	But the home side managed Gerrards absence well in the early stages, with Liverpool going close to opening the scoring three times inside the first 20 minutes.         
	Brazilian midfielder Fabio Aurelio, who netted a free-kick during the 4-1 win at Old Trafford last March, almost repeated the feat with a stunning 16th-minute effort from 20 yards. But United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar produced a full-length save to keep the left-foot strike before scrambling to his feet and blocking Dirk Kuyts follow-up shot.         
	United were struggling to gain a foothold and Paul Scholes, otherwise impressive, lost the ball to Lucas in the centre-circle on 18 minutes, allowing the midfielder to tee up Kuyt, whose shot flashed across the face of goal.         
	Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina was finally called into action on 21 minutes, though, when Antonio Valencias cross resulted in a free header for Wayne Rooney, which the Spaniard saved comfortably.         
	Uniteds passing was slicker and more threatening than Liverpools and both Valencia and Dimitar Berbatov should have done better when in good positions.         
	Berbatov was fortunate not to concede a penalty on 45 minutes after a wrestling match with Kuyt that left the Liverpool midfielder with a torn shirt.         
	United survived that scare, with referee Andre Marriner missing the foul.         
	But after dominating the early stages of the second-half, United were caught out when Torres broke away to score a trademark goal.         
	Released by Yossi Benayoun, Torres escaped the challenge of Rio Ferdinand before beating Van der Sar with an unstoppable shot into the roof of the net at the Kop end. Having fallen behind, United now needed a lifeline to get themselves back into the game, prompting Sir Alex Ferguson to introduce Michael Owen from the bench.         
	As expected, the former Liverpool forward was greeted with a torrent of boos as he stepped onto the pitch in place of Berbatov on 74 minutes.         
	Once a Manc, never a Red, chanted the Kop as Uniteds No 7 entered the field.         
	Owen almost created an equaliser for Valencia on 84 minutes when his lay off was sent crashing against the bar by the United winger.         
	Carragher was then fortunate to escape a red card for hauling Owen to the floor on the edge of the penalty area on 87 minutes. Marriner booked the Liverpool defender, despite him being the last man.         
	Three minutes later, Vidic earned a second yellow card for dragging down Kuyt on the halfway line.         
	Mascherano then followed him for a wild lunge at Van der Sar before Ngog made it 2-0 five minutes into stoppage time.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

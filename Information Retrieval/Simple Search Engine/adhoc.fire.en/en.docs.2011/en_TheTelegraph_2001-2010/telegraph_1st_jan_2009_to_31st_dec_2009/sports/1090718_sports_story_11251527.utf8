The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Freddie will inspire the hosts: Gilly
                                                   Freddie will inspire the hosts: Gilly
                      
	London: Andrew Flintoffs teammates would do everything to win the ongoing Ashes series as a farewell gift to the burly all-rounder, believes former Australia wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist.         
	Gilchrist paid glowing tribute to Flintoff and felt his retirement would inspire England to put their best foot forward in the ongoing Ashes.         
	I dont think the Aussies will be affected but it can be a boost for the English players, Gilchrist said. I know from my time that a when a great player retired, you did everything you could to see him off with a series win. So England will be up for this Ashes series even more, said the Australian.         
	Gilchrist had no qualms admitting that Flintoff, as an opponent, often made life difficult for him.         
	Freddie announcing his retirement means there will be a lot of Test cricketers sleeping easy now. He definitely terrorised me and my teammates on many occasions, he said.         
	Gilchrist was of the view that Flintoff, as the premier all-rounder of his era, shouldered more responsibility than his body could endure and paid the price with a premature retirement.         
	Its always sad when a player of that calibre retires but his body clearly couldnt cope with the demands. I think Freddie is a victim of his own abilities and skill  he happily took on huge responsibility with the bat and ball, he said.

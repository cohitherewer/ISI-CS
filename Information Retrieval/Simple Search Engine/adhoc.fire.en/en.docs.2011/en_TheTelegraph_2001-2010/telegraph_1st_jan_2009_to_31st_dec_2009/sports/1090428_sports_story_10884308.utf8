The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | US, Italy enter final
                                                   US, Italy enter final
                      
	London: The United States and Italy reached the Fed Cup final, with the Americans saving a match point in the decisive match of the best-of-five series and the Italians ousting defending champion Russia.         
	The Americans, who have won a record 17 Fed Cup titles but none since 2000, beat the Czech Republic 3-2 in Brno Sunday.         
	Liezel Huber and Bethanie Mattek-Sands saved a match point before defeating Iveta Benesova and Kveta Peschke 2-6, 7-6 (2), 6-1 in the decisive doubles match.         
	Italy beat Russia 4-1, with Francesca Schiavone earning the winning point for Italy by defeating Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 7-6 (6), 4-6, 6-2. The Russians had won four of the last five Fed Cup titles, with Italy taking the other title in 2006. The 2009 final, which will be in Italy, is set for November 7-8. The Czech doubles team broke Mattek-Sands serve twice in the first set, and then broke Huber twice in the second to lead 3-1. The Americans, however, saved a match point at 5-2 and fought back to level the set at 5-5 before forcing the tie-breaker.         
	At the end, we were lucky, Huber said. We took our chances.         
	In the final set, Benesova was broken in the second game and sixth game before Huber served out the match, converting the second match point.           (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jonty for fielding captain
                                                   Jonty for fielding captain
                      
	Durban: John Buchanans multiple captaincy idea has found partial backing from Jonty Rhodes who feels a fielding captain can act as a facilitator to the normal skipper.         
	Rhodes, now Mumbai Indians fielding coach, said a fielding captain can relieve some of the burden on the teams regular skipper in a Twenty20 game.         
	You can have a guy who is responsible for fielding, if you want to call him the fielding captain thats fine, he said at Mumbai Indians base camp here.         
	Also if there is an instance where the player could dive but doesnt then, without adding pressure on him, you need the guy (fielding captain) to tell him what couldve been the result if only he had attempted the dive, Rhodes said.         
	Thats not the captains role (to advise the fielders). He has many other things on his head. The fielding captain is like a facilitator.Rhodes said his former captain Hansie Cronje had given him the task of monitoring the field to make sure all the players were attentive, and that helped South Africa become one of the best fielding units.

    - McCullum prepared to step aside if knights dont make semis           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Port Elizabeth: Sachin Tendulkar-Sanath Jayasuriya.         
	The dream opening combination in any limited-overs game became the Kolkata Knight Riders nightmare at a packed St Georges Park here on Monday evening.         
	MoM Sachin turned 36 last week, while Sanath turns 40 in June. Batsmen half their age, though, would struggle to match the pace of the stalwarts, who blasted 111 in the first 10 overs.         
	Three-fourths of the face-off remained, but the Mumbai Indians, after winning the toss, were already on the road to victory.         
	Eventually, the Mumbai Indians won by as many as 92 runs (with almost five overs remaining), handing out the humiliation in the presence of their co-owner Nita Ambani as also the Knights principal owner, Shah Rukh Khan.         
	Just three points in five games is an awful bottomline, but Shah Rukh and the rest of the management team have contributed to this dismal state of affairs.         
	Having said that, the players too must take responsibility, but some neither have the skills nor the josh to overcome difficult moments.         
	Shah Rukh, who reached Port Elizabeth on a chartered flight, had spent some time on the field during the Knights warm-up session. The customary hugs and words of encouragement were there, but nothing worked for the home engagement.         
	After the match, captain Brendon McCullum admitted that some pretty strong messages were given in the dressing room and that hed be prepared to step aside if the Knights didnt make the semi-finals.         
	The way we batted was frustrating, McCullum added.         
	On Sunday, however, John Buchanan had (in a one-on-one with The Telegraph) insisted that he had every reason to look ahead with confidence.         
	Pretty misplaced that, as the Knights head of cricket operations wouldve realised.         
	Getting back to the masters, both Sachin and Jayasuriya are in their 20th year of international cricket, but still as hungry as they were in their debut season  1989-90.         
	Their partnership was broken in the 13th over, by Laxmi Ratan Shukla, who got captain Sachin (68 from 45 balls, 6x4, 4x6), but by then 127 had been put on the board.         
	Clearly, the Knights cheerleaders couldnt have asked for a more relaxed outing.         
	The Mumbai Indians overconfidence and a rather unnecessary change in the batting order (Harbhajan Singh coming at No.3), did subsequently keep them on their toes somewhat, but its the Mumbai Indians cheerleaders who hardly got a breather.         
	It didnt help the Knights that medium-pacer Anureet Singh, whod been impressive against the Rajasthan Royals, hurt himself in the evenings very first over and the team was one specialist bowler short straightaway.         
	Because of the slip-ups, the Mumbai Indians, whod looked like becoming the first to cross 200 in this edition of the IPL, ended at 187 for six, two short of the best, 189 for five by the Deccan Chargers.         
	Jayasuriya, the second of Shuklas three victims, scored 52 (off 32 balls, 2x4, 4x6).         
	I was happy with the total we reached, but 188 was achievable and, so, we tried not to be overconfident while bowling... Funny things can happen, Sachin remarked.         
	Asked whether hed expected the Knights to pack up so fast, Sachin answered: Not really, but funny things are possible...         
	For the Knights to have even a semblance of a chance, McCullum and Chris Gayle had to get off to a flyer.         
	The start was anything but that  McCullum is no longer the player he was last year, when he wasnt burdened by anything  and top-scorer Sourav Ganguly (34) merely delayed the inevitable.         
	Not by much, though.         
	According to McCullum, the in-form Sourav continues to come at No.4 (after Brad Hodge) because hes comfortable at that position.         
	Thats debatable.  
	SHAH RUKH-SPEAK   ldquo;Our team has not gelled together... It rsquo;s very sad... We could not raise our level to that of the Mumbai Indians... Their opening partnership was great... When a team starts like that, with two great players, you realise it becomes one-sided... Only (Chris) Gayle and (Brendon) McCullum could rsquo;ve won the game for us, but once we lost them early... rdquo;

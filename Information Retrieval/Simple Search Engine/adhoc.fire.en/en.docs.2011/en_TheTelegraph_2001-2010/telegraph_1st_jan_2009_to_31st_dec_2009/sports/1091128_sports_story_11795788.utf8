            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal coach Phillippe de Ridder believes that the team will continue to suffer until the players from the national camp rejoined the club.         
	After Fridays shock 1-2 defeat at the hands of Tollygunge Agragami, the Belgian coach said that he still needs a three weeks to transform the side.         
	I am not a magician I still need three weeks. Things cannot be done overnight, you need time to settle down I need to change the attitude of the players and that transformation is not at all an easy task, Ridder said.         
	I believe that until the players from the national camp are back, East Bengal are going to suffer, the Belgian added.         
	As to what went wrong against Tollygunge, Ridder said: Look, this is a game only and they (Tollygunge) played really well. I am happy that the boys tried their best happy that we created chances. But its our hard luck that we missed them.

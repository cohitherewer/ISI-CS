                                                     Jeev Milkha earns India direct entry 
                  Jeev Milkha Singh                     
	New Delhi: Thanks to Jeev Milkha Singhs presence among golfing elites, India became one of the six Asian countries to earn a direct entry to the 2009 Omega Mission Hills World Cup to be played in Shenzhen, China from November 26 to 29.         
	The field, selected on the basis of each nations leading player on the Official World Golf Ranking as of June 22, is headed by world No.5 Sergio Garcia, ranked No.4 at the cut-off date.         
	There are always a lot of good teams at the World Cup. I think that the Swedish team, the defending champions, will be very good, Garcia said in a statement. The Americans always seem to bring a good solid team into the tournament. Australia, of course, are going to have a good one coming in. One of the Asian teams could be solid.         
	Among the Asian countries, 42nd ranked Jeev Milkha Singh will represent India, with Jyoti Randhawa as his likely partner while Thongchai Jaidee will spearhead Thailands challenge for the second straight year.         
	Lin Wen-tang will lead Chinese Taipei, US-based Charlie Wi will represent Korea while Ryuji Imada, who featured for Japan and finished tied third last year, will return for another crack at the prestigious team title.         
	Swede Henrik Stenson, the world No.7, has confirmed he will defend the title but he may have to choose a new partner as 2008 European No.1 Robert Karlsson might need to take the rest of the year off because of an eye problem.         
	The hopes of a first American win since Tiger Woods and Mark Mearas victory in 2000 will rest on the shoulders of world No.34 Nick Watney and whoever he selects as teammate.         
	Nineteen countries, including hosts China, have already secured their places in Shenzhen with nine more spots up for grabs at regional qualifiers.           (REUTERS)

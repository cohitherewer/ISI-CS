The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | NZ blank   India in opener
                                                   NZ blank   India in opener
                                  
	Perth: The Indian team badly missed Sania Mirza as it made a miserable start to the Fed Cup, losing 0-3 to New Zealand in their opening group I tie of the Asia/Oceania zonal play-offs here on Wednesday.         
	Rushmi Chakravarthi, up against a non-ranked Dianee Hollands, was no match for her opponent and was outplayed 3-6, 0-6.         
	In the second match, Indias No. 1 player, Ankita Bhambri, was threashed 2-6, 3-6 by world No. 68 Marina Eracovic.         
	In the inconsequential doubles rubber, Ankita teaming up with her sister Sanaa Bhambri, lost 2-6, 3-6 to Eracovic and Kairangi Vano.         
	Team captain Enrico Piperno was a disappointed man. The girls did not play to their potential. The opposition was tough but our girls played bad. It makes the job tougher for India now, Piperno said.         
	India next play Indonesia, who pulled off a big upset, beating Uzbekistan 2-1 in another pool A match, on Friday.         
	Meanwhile, fresh from her surprising quarter final run at the Australian Open, Jelena Dokic led Australia to a 3-0 win over South Korea in a pool B match.         
	Dokic, representing Australia at the Fed Cup for the first time since 2000, had a 6-0, 6-3 win over Lee Jin-A. Samantha Stosur beat Lee Ye-ra 6-2, 6-4 and then Casey Dellacqua and Rennae Stubbs combined to win the doubles.         
	I could have gone to Europe or America but I made it very clear I wanted to play Fed Cup and I would always make myself available again for Australia, just like I did before, Dokic said. There was no way for me to miss this opportunity to play again.         
	In the other group B encounter, Tamarine Tanasugarn led Thailand to a 3-0 win over Taiwan.         
	The pool A winner will advance to Saturdays final against the pool B winner.         
	Saturdays eventual winner will then advance to the World Group II play-off in April for the right to join the top-16 countries in next years Fed Cup.           (AGENCIES)

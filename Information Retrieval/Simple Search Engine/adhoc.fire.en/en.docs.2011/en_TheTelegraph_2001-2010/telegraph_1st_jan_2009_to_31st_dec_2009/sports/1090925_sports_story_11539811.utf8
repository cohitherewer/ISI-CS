The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Boys were clinical: Smith
                                                     Boys were clinical: Smith
                  Graeme Smith                     
	Centurion: South Africa captain Graeme Smith heaved a sigh of relief and said his side played the kind of clinical game expected of worlds top team, against New Zealand Thursday.         
	The boys gave a clinical performance today. We played the way we had been doing for the last few months, which made us the worlds top team, he said after his sides five-wicket win over New Zealand.         
	I thought to get us home in the 42nd over was a good effort, Smith said.         
	We knew the pitch would be a touch slow and wed have to work harder with the bat today. The nature of the pitch was such that to really attack the spinner was tough.         
	South Africa were the No.1 team in the ICC rankings before the start of Champions Trophy but the Proteas slipped to third following their 55-run loss to Sri Lanka in the tournament opener.         
	Smith praised his bowlers for restricting the Black Caps to a modest 214.         
	Dale Steyn and Wayne Parnell set up the match for us with their fine bowling efforts and then De Villiers and the other batsmen stood up. The big guys stood up in our important match I am very happy, he added.         
	Left-arm spinner Roelof van der Merwe, who took two for 35, also received praise from his captain.         
	Roelof is one of the most competitive players in our squad, he even gets worked up in schools games, Smith said.         
	He plays at 100 per cent and its great to see his skills are at the same level as his competitiveness, Smith said.         
	Smith admitted his side had been a bit tentative in their match against Sri Lanka.         
	We were a bit tentative against Sri Lanka. We were a lot more intense today, he said.         
	We have improved a hell of a lot from the first game. It was a far better day all round.         
	New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori was disappointed that his batsmen could not put up a competitive total.         
	South Africa bowled really well, we got bogged down. We could not score much from the last 10 overs.         
	If we had got something around 250, it would have been a competitive total, Vettori said.         
	He said his side felt the need of an extra spinner on the SuperSport pitch which assisted slow bowlers.         
	We would have played a second spinner if Oram wasnt injured.         
	He was injured and since we were struggling with our batting we went with an extra batsman for the sake of balance, he said.         
	But we will come back strongly in our next match against Lanka at the Wanderers. That will be a different wicket which should assist the fast bowlers, he added.         
	Man of the Match Wayne Parnell said a relaxed approach despite the bashing he received against Sri Lanka was the key to his performance.         
	I gave away 79 runs from my 10 overs against Sri Lanka though I got three wickets. I was a bit nervous going into todays match, said Parnell, who claimed his maiden five-for (5/57) in his sixth one-dayer.         
	But later on I tried to be relaxed and that did the trick. Picking up five in this match was a good way to bounce back.         
	You could say that Centurion is my best and worst ground, Parnell added.           (AGENCIES)

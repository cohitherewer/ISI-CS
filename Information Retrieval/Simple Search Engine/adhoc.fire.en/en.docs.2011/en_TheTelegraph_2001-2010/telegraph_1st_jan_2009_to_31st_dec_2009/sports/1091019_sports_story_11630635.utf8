The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis fate to be decided today
                                                     Younis fate to be decided today
            OUR BUREAU AMP; AGENCIES      EIGHTH COLUMN            Younis Khan                           
	Calcutta/Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) will announce Monday whether Younis Khan will continue as captain of the Test and ODI sides or a new skipper will take over.         
	Despite having quit the captaincy, Younis continues to enjoy the complete support of PCB chairman Ejaz Butt, and so because of this support, it should not come as a surprise if he is retained captain for the series versus New Zealand. The ODIs and the Twenty20s will be played in UAE and the Tests will be played in New Zealand.         
	Butt is due to address a press conference immediately after concluding a meeting of the governing council in Lahore, in which he is expected to inform the members what he plans to do.         
	Pakistan cricket plunged into a crisis last week when Younis submitted his resignation to Butt, in protest against the match-fixing allegations made against him and his team, for losing to Australia and New Zealand in the Champions Trophy.         
	The crisis has also created a clear divide in Pakistan cricket, with one side pressurising the board to accept Youniss resignation, while the other side believes the board should convince Younis to take back his resignation by accepting some of his demands.         
	The anti-Younis camp is saying if the board does not accept the resignation, it might lead to an open revolt by eight to nine players. The anti-Younis side has also taken great pains to point out that Youniss exit would have no political repercussions as sports minister Aftab Shah Jillani has made it clear that the government would not interfere in the matter.         
	Younis met the chairman last week, and made his position very clear. First, he will only take back his resignation if he is appointed till the tour of England next year. Second, he does not want Yawar Saeed or Shafqat Rana continuing in the management set up, a close aide of Younis said.         
	If the board wants the betterment of Pakistan cricket and the team, they must accept Youniss demands. Younis, on his part, has no issues playing as an ordinary member of the team, but he will not like to be a toothless captain, the aide said.         
	He also said Younis had told Butt to call those players who have problems with him to meet face-to-face and sort out things. Younis is a dedicated and honest person, who will not tolerate anything less than 100 per cent from the other players, he said.         
	Apparently, vice-captain Shahid Afridi and senior players Misbah-ul Haq, Shoaib Malik and Kamran Akmal feel Younis has been behaving like a dictator, believing he could be another Imran Khan.

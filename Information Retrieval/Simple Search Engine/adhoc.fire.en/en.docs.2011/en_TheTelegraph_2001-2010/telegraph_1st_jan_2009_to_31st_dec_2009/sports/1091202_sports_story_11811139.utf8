	Apart from Shukla, who was out due to a quadriceps strain, replacing Sayan Sekhar Mondal, there were no major surprises in the 15-member-squad which was announced Tuesday.         
	Sourav Ganguly, who has so far played the matches against Baroda and Saurashtra, at home, will be playing his first away game considering the importance of the encounter.

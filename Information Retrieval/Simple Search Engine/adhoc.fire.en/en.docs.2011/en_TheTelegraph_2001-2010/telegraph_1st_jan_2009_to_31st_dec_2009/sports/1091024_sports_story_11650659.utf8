The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Blues set for battle
                                                   Blues set for battle
                      
	London: The beach balls have been bought, the songs dusted down and the internet rants prepared as Manchester United seek to bounce Liverpool out of the title race on Sunday with almost three quarters of the season remaining.         
	But before that Chelsea, currently behind Alex Fergusons team at second on the league table, will look to back their bid for the title with a strong show against Blackburn Rovers at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.         
	Tottenham Hotspur, Chelseas city rivals and third on the table for the scintillating form they have shown in winning six of their nine matches so far, take on Stoke City at White Hart Lane.         
	Chelsea, beaten at Aston Villa last week, warmed up for the Blackburn game by hammering Atletico Madrid 4-0 at home in the Champions League on Wednesday and, although the Blues have lost to unlikely opponents in the league, they remain one of the strongest contenders for the title.         
	Also Saturday, Aston Villa are at Wolverhampton Wanderers, Wigan at Burnley, Sunderland at Birmingham and Portsmouth at Hull.           (AGENCIES)

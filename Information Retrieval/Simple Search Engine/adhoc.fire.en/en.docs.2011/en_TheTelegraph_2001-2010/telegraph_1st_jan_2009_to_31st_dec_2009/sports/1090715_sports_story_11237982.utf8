The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ex-captains criticise England ploy
                                                   Ex-captains criticise England ploy
                      
	London: Four former England captains have criticised the time-wasting tactics used by the hosts in their drawn first Ashes Test against Australia.         
	England drew the match in Wales on Sunday after last batting pair James Anderson and Monty Panesar held out for 69 balls. But Australia captain Ricky Ponting was upset by Englands 12th man twice running on to the pitch in the final overs, the second time accompanied by the team physiotherapist, describing the tactics as ordinary and suggesting the umpires should have intervened.         
	He received support from former England leaders Nasser Hussain, Bob Willis, Ray Illingworth and John Emburey.         
	When the 12th man and physio came on at the same time, they went too far, Hussain said in his column Tuesday for The Daily Mail. It wasnt a street-wise move at all  it was village-green stuff. It was amateur and embarrassing to watch. And it was bad for the game  more like diving to win a penalty than delaying a throw-in.         
	It didnt spoil a classic Test match but it did lead to a slightly farcical finish, which was a shame. If I were Ponting, I would have been angry, too, and would have told the physio to get off.         
	Emburey said the move could have backfired and broken the concentration of Anderson or Panesar, Willis said Pontings reaction was proportionate and measured, while Illingworth was annoyed by what he claims were pathetic excuses for the interruptions.         
	If the series finishes 0-0 or England win 1-0, it will come up again, Emburey said in The Guardian. (AP)

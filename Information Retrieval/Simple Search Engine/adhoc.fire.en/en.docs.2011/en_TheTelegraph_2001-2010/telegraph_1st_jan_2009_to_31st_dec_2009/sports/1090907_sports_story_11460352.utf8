The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | As a footballer, I havent progressed in Calcutta
                                                   As a footballer, I havent progressed in Calcutta
    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
	   Captain Bhaichung Bhutia in a candid one- on- one      LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                          
	Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutia, Indias football captain for the last nine years and the countrys most capped player, spoke to The Telegraph for over 75 minutes at his tastefully done up residence here the other afternoon. Bhaichung, who turns 33 in December, is also the Football Players Association of India president.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q For a few days, you and your team forced cricket off the main sports pages. Did that bring about a sense of satisfaction?         
	A (Laughs) Retaining the Nehru Cup gave the biggest satisfaction... Coverage and other things are secondary... I guess there will be some hype and mileage if you play well and win tournaments... We were under pressure to retain the trophy and we handled that well. Now, people expect us to win, which is a good thing.         
	[Besides the two Nehru Cups, weve won three tournaments under Bhaichungs captaincy.]         
	Are you, too, a cricket-basher?         
	Not at all. Why bash cricket? In fact, Ive always maintained that we need to clean up our house first... Cricket has been doing brilliantly and, instead of being critical, we should absorb the good points and market football in a much better manner... We need to learn from cricket and exist side by side... Dont forget were in an era where everything is commercial.         
	The cricket Board is bailing out the All India Football Federation (AIFF)...         
	Its a great gesture and will go a long way in helping us prepare for the 2011 Asian Cup, a tournament for which weve qualified after decades.         
	Its creditable to have retained the Nehru Cup, but except Syria, the other teams werent even close to being hot. So, do such tournaments really help?         
	They do... Its important to play in touraments where the other teams are of the same standard and a bit higher and a bit lower... Theres no point playing against vastly superior teams and getting thrashed... When that happens, even the confidence goes and confidence is such a huge thing in sport... I endorse (coach) Bob Houghtons plan to keep playing against the teams we can compete with. Frankly, within Asia, we arent ready to take on Japan or South Korea and it wouldnt help to be hammered by them. Weve got to have a step by step approach, eventually aiming to take on Japan and South Korea. No point trying to take 10 steps at a time... Houghtons plan shouldve been thought of in the Eighties and Nineties. We would, then, have been better-placed today.         
	Youre a Houghton fan...         
	(Grins) Everybody has to be judged on his/her performance and, under Bob, weve won three trophies (two Nehru Cups and the AFC Challenge Cup) in as many years... Thats a good record... He has ideas and, by now, has understood Indian football well... When we go overseas, the media there may not know about Sunil Chetri or me, but everybody is aware of Bob... When we went to Barcelona recently, the media there didnt know anything about any of our players, but everybody knew Bobs background... Thats a plus... He puts his foot down if the facilities arent up to the mark and, if theres a problem technically, hes there to sort it out.         
	But he stays in a different, often a higher-rated, hotel...         
	Thats Bobs style... He wants to keep a distance and treats everybody equally... Performance gets you a place in his XI, not your closeness to the coach... Its not about being in the good books of the coach... Im comfortable with his approach... I dont think its necessary for the coach to stay in the same hotel, he doesnt have to act like a headmaster. Its not that Bob doesnt inquire about our well-being, the standard of our accommodation, the food... He keeps a track and his advice is simple: Be responsible. I should add that, nowadays, we do stay in good hotels... A big improvement from the shit ones of the past.         
	How often do you interact with Houghton on non-match days?         
	You may not believe it, but I didnt even have his cell number till the just-ended Nehru Cup! We talk during classes and at the training sessions. If there are other issues, theyve got to be sorted out with the manager. Thats how it should be.         
	Is there a significant difference in the mindset of coaches in India and the ones who come from overseas?         
	I wouldnt say all foreign coaches are good... Ive worked with some who havent been so... At the same time, Ive worked with some good Indian coaches, but wouldnt like to single out one or two... What Id like to say is that our coaches must get opportunities to learn and to work overseas. Its needed for their development.         
	Youve played for Bury FC in England ...How did the people there react to your presence?         
	It was one of amazement... How did you learn football in India? Nobody there believed that, in some ways, the sport was quite big in India... I guess wed react the same way if a cricketer from Brazil turned up to play here! (After a pause) Today, Indias ranked No.149, which is no big deal... Realistically, in the big world of football, nobody knows about our existence.         
	Its disappointing that Chetri couldnt get a work permit for the UK...         
	Absolutely... Couldve been a great opportunity for Sunil with the Queens Park Rangers.         
	Briefly, how can the standard of Indian football improve? Millions of Indians are passionate about Brazil and Germany and England, to name a few countries, but havent really been enthused by their own national team... How is this going to change?         
	I get your point... Interest is bound to increase if the team does well consistently... Performance, clearly, is the key... To improve, we need to play more... Weve just played a handful of matches this year and dont know when we will be playing next... The exposure bit, which is critical, comes in... Also, for the national team to do well, good players are needed... To produce good players, the country needs a good development programme and excellent infrastructure. Its a cycle, you know. Im not suggesting all this is the responsibility only of the AIFF... The state associations and clubs have to play a role as well, and in a big way. Bottomline is that a good system is required.         
	Youve mentioned clubs... Two of the biggest, Mohun Bagan and East Bengal, are in the city which has been your home from the early 1990s...         
	Sadly, they dont reach out beyond Calcutta or Bengal... A lot of kids in New Delhi and Mumbai, coming from rich families, are taking to football. However, their favourite teams are either Manchester United or Chelsea or Arsenal or... Not East Bengal or Mohun Bagan... Why not? Thats because the clubs havent reached out, they havent learnt to brand themselves... Theyre happy being in the state they are, continuing to have the approach of the 1950s, even though the world has changed so much. Its shocking that Mohun Bagan and East Bengal still dont have a ground of their own! Their grounds are owned by the ministry of defence... So many greats have turned out for both clubs, but look at how their portraits are hung... Why not have a museum? Why not souvenir shops? Forget all that, they dont have proper toilets. Thats the state the two clubs are in and, sadly, are happy being that way... Both East Bengal and Mohun Bagan need to change with the times... Need to look at the benefit of academies, of producing players in-house... Man U is even growing beyond football... It has just opened a restaurant and bar in New Delhi! So much for expanding a brand which is already so well known... The Indian clubs, especially the bigger ones, need to brand themselves... That would be a good starting point to go forward.         
	What would be your priority  investing in quality infrastructure or a professionally-run development programme?         
	Both... Actually, Id like the AIFF to review the entire system in the country... The acting president (Praful Patel) has ideas, but much would depend on the kind of people he gets to work with under him.         
	Has anybody in the AIFF ever asked you, the India captain, for suggestions?         
	(Grins) No... If I have to sit down and prepare a paper, then Ill have to stop playing... Im sure there are people whore supposed to be looking at ways to go forward. Its their headache... I do know there are people willing to work hard, but our biggest problem, I think, is that we dont have enough people with the knowledge to implement things in the correct manner... You need people with brains to put things in the right place...(After a pause) Id rather concentrate on playing.         
	For an Indian sportsman, youre very outspoken. Is that your nature or has frustration made you talk bluntly?         
	I never say things, positive or negative, without a reason. A lot of people say things for the sake of saying something. Thats not me... I do get frustrated about a lot of things and speak out, but its issue-driven...         
	Youve been playing in the Calcutta league from 1993. Over the years, just how much has life changed?         
	Off the field, the lifestyle has changed, yes... Then, expectations are higher... Theres more responsibility on ones shoulders... The better you are on the field, the better you will be off it (materially)... What Ive learnt is that the clubs expect you to deliver.         
	As a footballer, how much have you grown by playing in Calcutta?         
	Look, the Calcutta league wont take you to the next level... Wont take football to the next level... I say that because we dont play in the best of conditions... Slushy surfaces dont produce quality football... I say that because for the past so many decades, the title has been won almost exclusively either by East Bengal or Mohun Bagan... I say that because I dont see things changing in the next 20 years... If Im to look at it purely selfishly, then Ive gained... In monetary terms, in terms of adulation, in terms of big headlines, but not otherwise. Indeed, purely as a footballer, I havent progressed by playing in Calcutta.         
	Nowadays, theres little crowd support...         
	Thats because the boorish behaviour of a section of the crowd keeps the bhadralok away... Keeps away many young fans, too... Football cant afford to lose quality fans and the administrators need to address this issue.         
	Is it a must to be on good terms with the club officials? Whats your experience?         
	Yes, youve got to be on good terms, but that doesnt guarantee anything. If you dont perform, those very officials will be the first to give you a kick.         
	Youre still very upset with the way Mohun Bagan treated you...         
	I have good reasons... Suspended without salary.         
	Does the emotional nature of fans in Calcutta add to pressure?         
	It does and I advise fellow-players not to read the newspapers after a bad day in the office... Doing so brings down the level of confidence even more... Negative comments and thoughts dont help... Every para has experts... After a bad day, a player only has to step out the next morning to be told kalke ki khellen... Its very demoralising.         
	Whats your advice after a good day?         
	Buy two copies of each newspaper! Its nice to read and hear good things about oneself.         
	You grew up idolising Diego Maradona... Is there somebody you envy?         
	I envy the entire Barcelona team and the FC Barcelona set-up... I like the teams style... I also like Arsenal, like the way they play.         
	Did you get to talk to your idol during his Calcutta visit last December?         
	Shook hands, thats all. It was so chaotic.         
	Is there a message for young footballers?         
	Youve got to be passionate and work hard... Have your priorities right... Self-discipline is important. I go to parties, but you wont find me partying on the eve of an important match... Its about priorities and knowing whats good for you.         
	The last one: Youve recently been seen with a number of pretty women, at some promotional or the other. Has wife Madhuri been tweaking your ears?         
	(Laughs) No... No... She trusts me and I trust her... Weve been married for over four years and have known each other for seven-eight years... She doesnt have to worry.

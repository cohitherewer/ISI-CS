The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan recruit has a mission
                                                   Bagan recruit has a mission
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagans new signing Micky Fernandes followed his heart in deciding which team to play for in the coming season. The Sporting Clube de Goa midfielder said he had offers from Dempo SC and East Bengal.         
	But I chose Bagan since I had always had this wish of playing for them. This offer was there for the last four years. This time I could not say no even though other offers were more enticing, Micky said from Goa.         
	Micky, who missed the second phase of the I-league due to typhoid, said the fact that Karim Bencharifa was at the helm also played a part in him going for the green and maroon brigade.         
	A player equally at home on the right as well as at the centre of the park, Micky is also looking forward to sharing the dressing room with Bhaichung Bhtuia and Jose Ramirez Barreto. There is so much to learn from these two, he said.         
	Micky who was in the Indian team that lost to Yemen in an Asian Cup qualifier at New Delhi three years ago, said he would use his Bagan stint as a springboard to the national team. I want to make a comeback to the Indian team, and good performance in a Bagan shirt will help me, he said.         
	Micky also has a point to prove. They say that Goan footballers find it difficult to adjust to the Calcutta way of football as if we are not good enough for Calcutta football. I want to prove that wrong. Agreed there is too much pressure from the fans and the media, but I am ready for the challenge, he signed off.         
	Meanwhile, Bagan have roped in midfielder Genius Zenith of Churchill Brothers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wright would like to work with Sourav once again
                                                   Wright would like to work with Sourav once again
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Chennai: Former India coach John Wright has said he doesnt mind working with Sourav Ganguly for Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League next year.         
	While principal owner Shah Rukh Khan is understood to be moving towards reinstating icon Sourav as captain, getting on board Wright  whod forged a strong bond with the former India captain during much of his five-plus years as the Team India coach  is also very much on the cards.         
	In Chennai to assist the New Zealand A side in the Buchi Babu tournament, Wright said: We worked well together. It was a good combination... Looking to working with Sourav again.         
	Wright also recalled the exciting stint with Team India under Sourav. Working here is always so exciting It keeps you rather busy and it is also part of the excitement, Wright said.         
	Sourav and myself are strong individuals and we had great times being in the same boat. He was the first captain from Bengal and I was the first foreign coach for India, and we knew we had to win matches. He did his things his way. I would challenge him. Sometimes, we did not know why to agree.         
	He did things differently, but we had great trust in our relationship. I was so proud at the way he fought back after being dropped. It is always nice to see that your players are doing well, when you are out of the job and being away in your own country, said the former New Zealand opener.         
	Looking back at his stint with the Indian team, Wright said he had a good time.         
	You always try to work with the individuals in the team to make them better. Sometimes that requires some encouragement and sometimes it requires some firm words. I think that is part and parcel of a coaching cycle.         
	It is always a bit of both and sometimes you can please everyone. I do know that working in India, you have to get results and I love about that in India cricket. I am honest that it is not fun coaching a losing team, he said.         
	Wright said he was also pleased to see pacer Zaheer Khans revival. I was really impressed with Zaheer. His improvement has been tremendous. He is a world class fast bowler. I have seen his development from the time when he wanted to be a professional cricketer.         
	Wright said India has the biggest talent pool in international cricket. He coached India for four years and says the biggest difference between the side then and now, is the increased confidence.         
	There seems to be more confidence in the team. They seem to be winning outside India more. The Test team has so much of players that I had worked with. The team that won the World Twenty20 is an exciting side. Gary Kirsten has been working well with the team members.         
	Wright was also impressed by Mahendra Singh Dhonis captaincy.         
	I follow that Sachin wants to cross 15,000 runs and wants to win the World Cup. So, that probably in many ways, typifies the goals and the attitude that the members of the present team has... Dhonis captaincy is very impressive. He probably had a good tutor in Kumble. So India is making progress, he said.         
	On the issues facing the game, Wright said saving Test cricket is most important but warned against too much experimentation. ICC needs to be careful in tinkering with the five-day Test cricket. May be, if you do, you got to have a trial period. I feel very strongly that it is good to have the longer form of the game.         
	Limited-overs and Twenty20 is part of cricket. It is so hard for youngsters to learn properly in 50 and 20-over cricket, he said.         
	In shorter versions of the game, it is only a question of limiting the runs How do you expect the bowlers to learn to take wickets and the batsmen to make hundreds in games other than Test cricket! It is a great challenge for cricket administrators to get the balance right, he added.         
	Asked about the Wada-BCCI standoff on the whereabouts clause, Wright said a middle path has to be found. It is a complex situation... The best possible solution for the respective cricket boards will be to find a strong balance between maintaining privacy of the players and a common policy.

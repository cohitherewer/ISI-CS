                                                   Sushmita ends 26th
                      
	Berlin: Indian athlete Sushmita Singha Roy was nowhere near her personal best as she finished a dismal 26th in the womens heptathlon event on the second day of the 12th World Athletic Championships here.         
	Sushmita, who was lying 25th after the completion of five disciplines with 3774 points, managed to add 1209 points from the last two and finished last in the 26-athlete event late Sunday.         
	Jessica Ennis of Great Britain clinched the title with 6731 points in the seven-event competition.         
	In javelin throw, Sushmita managed to cover 36.03m to fetch 591 points  which is worse than her current years best performance of 39.17m.         
	It was followed by another disappointing show in the 800m event, where Sushmita clocked 2:36.13sec to pocket 618 points but it was not enough to improve her standing in the final tally. Sushmita eventually finished with a total of 4983 points.         
	India are being represented by six athletes in the championship, including women discus throwers Krishna Poonia, Seema Antil and 400m hurdles runner Joseph Abraham, who was disqualified Sunday.         
	Long-distance runner Surendra Kumar Singh will compete in mens 10,000m.           (PTI)

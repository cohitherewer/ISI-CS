                                                   Sangakkara is back as No.1
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara reclaimed the No. 1 position in the Reliance Mobile ICC Player Rankings for Test batsmen from India opener Gautam Gambhir after an impressive outing against New Zealand.         
	Sangakkara, in the second Test against the Black Caps, followed up his half-century in the first innings with an exquisite 109, his 20th Test century, in the second essay to claim the top spot for the fourth time in his career.         
	Sangakkara first achieved the No. 1 ranking in December, 2007 before he returned to the top spot in March, 2008 and then in July, 2009.         
	He is not the only one on the move after a successful campaign against New Zealand. Sangakkaras predecessor Mahela Jayawardene and middle-order batsmen Thilan Samaraweera, who was player of the series, have both achieved career-best rankings.         
	While Jayawardene has jumped four places to third position after knocks of 92 and 96 which made him the first Asian and fourth overall to be out in the 90s twice in a Test, Samaraweeras 11 th century has put him just outside the top 10 in 12 th position.         
	South Africas Dale Steyn leads the bowlers rankings. Indias Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan are placed at the fifth and the eighth spot respectively.

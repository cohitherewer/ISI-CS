	New Delhi: Indias aspirations of making the main rounds of the Asian under-19 championships suffered a huge jolt when they went down to hosts Iraq 0-5 in their opening Group C qualifiers in Arbil on Thursday.         
	Playing their first international tournament at home in the recent past, Iraq toyed with the listless Indians from the very beginning and led 2-0 at the half time. Striker Amjed Waleed Hussein was the architect of Iraqs victory. Apart from scoring a brace, he was also the brain behind two other goals scored by Mustafa Jouda and Saleem Mallakh. Mohammed Saad scored the last goal.         
	India have now very slim chances of moving ahead in the tournament as they have some tough matches ahead in the group league against Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman and Afghanistan.

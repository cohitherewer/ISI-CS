	Durban: Graeme Swann took five for 54 as England clinched victory by an innings and 98 runs on the fifth day of the second Test against South Africa at Kingsmead Wednesday.         
	The win gave England a 1-0 lead in the four-match series.         
	It took England just 75 minutes to complete their win after South Africa resumed at 76 for six. They were bowled out for 133.         
	Its not the best performance Ive seen by an England team but Im aware the series is very much alive and there is still hard work to be done, said England captain Andrew Strauss.         
	South Africa captain Graeme Smith, on the other hand, admitted that his side had been outplayed.         
	Weve got to look at ourselves in the mirror and bounce back very quickly, he said.         
	The third Test starts in Cape Town on Sunday.         
	Off-spinner Swann returned match figures of nine for 164 to earn his second successive Man of the Match award following a five-wicket haul and an innings of 85 in the drawn first Test at Centurion. Swann now has 62 wickets from 17 Tests.         
	South Africas faint hopes of extending their innings beyond lunch evaporated when Morne Morkel was out to the 11th ball of the morning.         
	Morkel was dropped by Strauss off the previous delivery from Swann, which the left-hander edged low to the England captains right. But Swann pushed the next ball through quicker and Morkel, stuck in his crease, was trapped leg before.         
	After that, Boucher and Paul Harris added 22 runs for the eighth wicket. The pair hung around grimly for seven overs.         
	Mark Boucher went on to make 29 before he gloved Stuart Broad down the leg side to wicket-keeper Matt Prior.         
	He was given not out by umpire Amiesh Saheba but England asked for a review and replays clearly showed that the ball had deviated off his glove.         
	Thus Boucher had to depart for the second time after initially being ruled not out. Theglovesman hit three boundaries inhis 65-ball knock and batted for 91minutes.         
	With hardly anything left to playfor, Paul Harris then started usingthe long handle. In the process, he hitfive boundaries.         
	Along with DaleSteyn, he added 21 runs for the ninthwicket and delayed the inevitable byconsuming 37 minutes.         
	Harris innings of 36 came to anend when he scooped JamesAnderson to Broad at mid-on. Swann completed the comprehensive win when he had Dale Steyn trapped leg before. Stuart Broad provided able support grabbing four for 43.

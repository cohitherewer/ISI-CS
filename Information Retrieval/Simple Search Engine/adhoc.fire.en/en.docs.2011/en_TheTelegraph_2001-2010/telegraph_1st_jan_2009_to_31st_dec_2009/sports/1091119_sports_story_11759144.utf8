            A STAFF REPORTER            Graeme Smith                                 
	Calcutta: An all out victory in the five-match one-day International (ODI) series against England will earn South Africa a chance to close the gap on Australia in the Reliance Mobile International Cricket Council ODI Championship table.         
	A 5-0 win will help Graeme Smith and Co. to reduce the gap with Australia to just two points. However, a clean sweep over the Proteas would help sixth-placed England to climb three places to third.         
	But, if the Proteas win 3-2, their victory margin will not be enough to maintain their second place and they will slip to third behind India.         
	On the contrary, a 3-2 win for England would witness them rise one spot to the fifth and consequently South Africa would drop to third, again providing India with the second spot.

	Panaji: Dempo take on Mumbai FC on Friday in the 15th round of the ONGC I-League, at the Nehru Stadium in Margao.         
	Dempo are fifth in the table with 19 points from 14 matches, while Mumbai FC are fourth with 23 points from as many matches.         
	Dempo, who lost 1-2 to JCT and drew against Churchill Brothers and Vasco, are keen to put on an improved performance against the Mumbai outfit.         
	We have worked on our mistakes and hopefully the boys will put up an improved performance on the morrow, Dempo coach Armando Colaco said.         
	With Joaquim Abranches not available, along with defender Domnic Noronha, the coach is planning to move midfielder Anthony Pereira upfront and bring in Jerry Jirsanga in his place.

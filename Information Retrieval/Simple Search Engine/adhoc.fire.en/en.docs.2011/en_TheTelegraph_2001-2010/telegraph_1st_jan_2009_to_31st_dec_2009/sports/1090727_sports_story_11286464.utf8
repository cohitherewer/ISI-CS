The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Family influenced decision: Flintoff
                                                   Family influenced decision: Flintoff
                      
	London: England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff says fitness issues had left him with little choice but to quit for the sake of his injury-ravaged body, and his family.         
	Ive done something like two years rehabilitation out of the last four and for my body, for my familys sake I have decided to call time on Tests and concentrate on the shorter form of cricket, he said.         
	It just came to a point where I would come back from an injury and have a couple of weeks where everything was fine, then things would go downhill again, the 31-year-old, who will quit Tests after the ongoing Ashes, told an English daily.         
	Youre whacking your foot down with something like 10 times your bodyweight going through it, you put your body in positions that are unnatural and, frankly, nobodys body is designed to do that hour after hour, he said.         
	Ive bowled with injuries for most of my career  most fast bowlers do. At Lords I was in discomfort for most of the game although it never got to the point where I was thinking this will be my last Test, he added.           (PTI)

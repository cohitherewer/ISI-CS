The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Inter retain league after Milan slip
                                                   Inter retain league after Milan slip
                      
	Milan: Inter Milan retained their Serie A title with three games to spare after second-placed AC Milan put in a weak performance to lose 1-2 at Udinese on Saturday.         
	Inters triumph, in former Chelsea coach Jose Mourinhos first season in charge, is their fourth straight scudetto and their 17th overall.         
	The champions, who will celebrate their success in Sundays home match with Siena, hold a seven-point lead with Milan only having two games left. Fans quickly congregated in Milans central square, Piazza Duomo, to wave flags and celebrate the title while television pictures showed Inter players dancing at their team retreat.         
	Mourinho has now won titles with Porto, Chelsea and Inter. Im a bit angry because the team should already be in bed but they have decided to take the bus and go to Milan. But I understand their desire to celebrate, he joked on Inters website.         
	For my part I still dont feel a symbol of Inter. Theres still some work to do on this. Well try and do it next year.         
	Inter have now joined Milan on 17 Italian titles with Juventus leading the way on 27. (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Benson: I am not retiring
                                                                                                                       7                                      Benson: I am not retiring
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: English umpire Mark Benson Tuesday dismissed reports which claimed that he was mulling retirement to protest the International Cricket Council (ICC)s Decision Review System (DRS).         
	He issued a statement and said that he remains a DRS supporter. Benson said he returned after the first days play in the second Test between Australia and the West Indies in Adelaide because of health problems and not because he was angry after one of his decisions was overruled by the DRS.         
	Following my withdrawal from the Adelaide Test and the media speculation about my future, I would like to clarify that I have not resigned as an elite panel umpire, the umpire said in the statement released by the ICC Tuesday.         
	I had withdrawn after the first days play as I felt that due to my general health, I was not up to the task and felt it was in the best interests of the game, the ICC and myself that I step down and hand over to Asad Rauf.         
	I have been in discussions with the ICC and we have agreed that I will undergo a series of medical assessments, he added.         
	Dismissing reports that linked his hasty return to the DRS, Benson said: I would also like to state clearly that my withdrawal had nothing to do with the DRS.

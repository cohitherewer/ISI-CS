	Kingston: Determined to regain their lost pride after a disappointing World Twenty20 campaign, India, on Monday, had their first training session since arriving in the Caribbean ahead of the four-match one-day International series against the West Indies.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men had light training and net sessions here under the watchful eyes of coach Gary Kirsten.         
	They play their first ODI on Friday at Sabina Park here.         
	Meanwhile, five members of the West Indies squad, including captain Chris Gayle, returned here following their semi-final defeat at the hands of Sri Lanka in the World Twenty20 in England.         
	Gayle said he is looking forward to a good series against India whom the West Indies beat in the Super Eight stage of the just-concluded Cup.         
	India are always a good one-day team and its always going to be difficult going up against them But it should be a good ODI series, he said.         
	Were both evenly matched and were both starting form scratch So well see what happens, he added. (PTI)

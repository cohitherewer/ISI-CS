The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England are up against mighty South Africans
                                                     England are up against mighty South Africans
                  Graeme Smith                     
	Centurion: High on confidence after upstaging Sri Lanka, England are bracing up for another tough encounter, against hosts South Africa, in the Champions Trophy here on Sunday.         
	The South Africans had lost their rain-marred opening match to Sri Lanka but bounced back well to beat New Zealand in their second game.         
	The English, drubbed 1-6 by Australia in a just-concluded home series, meanwhile, opened their campaign in style by beating one of the tournament favourites to spice up the race to the semi-finals.         
	But even with a morale-boosting win to start with, Andrew Strauss men have quite a task at hand against the South Africans. The Protea batting line-up is in good touch and the likes of Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers have done well, but skipper Graeme Smith remains crucial along with opener Herschelle Gibbs and Jacques Kallis. On the bowling front, teen sensation Wayne Parnell has taken some of the limelight away from his more accomplished fellow pacer Dale Steyn.         
	Parnell starred with a five-wicket haul in the win over New Zealand.

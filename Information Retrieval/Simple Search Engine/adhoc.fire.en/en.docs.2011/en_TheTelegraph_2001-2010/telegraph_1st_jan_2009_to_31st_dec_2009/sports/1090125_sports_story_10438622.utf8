The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | This game is all about the players: Kirsten 
                                                     This game is all about the players: Kirsten 
    - Coach on his admiration-winning style             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL                                    
	Calcutta: Gary Kirsten, who will complete a year as the Team India coach in March, keeps winning admirers by the day. More important, his biggest fans sit in the dressing room. Thats one huge difference between his and the Greg Chappell era.         
	Sourav Ganguly, Mahendra Singh Dhoni... Theyve all had nothing but praise for the South African, one of the very few to have played both 100 Tests and ODIs. On Monday, vice-captain Virender Sehwag went to the extent of describing the 41-year-old Kirsten as the best coach I have seen.         
	Sehwag said: His premise is: You all are international cricketers and you know how to succeed and how important it is to succeed. So, I wont thrust anything on you. But whenever you need me, for practice, throwing balls, sharing ideas, worries, I am always there...         
	Happy to stay away from the headlines, much like New Zealander John Wright (who coached the Sachin Tendulkars from November 2000 to April 2005), Kirsten spoke to The Telegraph on coaching.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q Your exploits as an opener are well known. As a person, though, youve always come across as somewhat of a recluse...         
	A (Laughs) Dont know about the recluse bit... I suppose its just the way I am... Thats what my personality is... Thats what I stand for... Obviously, people have seen a quality which could be of value to other cricketers.         
	How would you describe yourself?         
	Im a relatively quiet person... Im not someone too vocal... Having said that, Ive got an inner determination... Im someone with a good work ethic... I put time and effort in whatever I do... I try and make sure that I can add value to the environment I get into... Something that people can look at and say thats helped me... I dont like getting into the limelight... Of course, I was fortunate to play a decade of international cricket where, whether one likes it or not, one comes into the limelight.         
	Elder brother Peter appears more outgoing. Have you always been the quieter of the two?         
	Id like to think were quite similar in a lot of ways... But, yes, hes probably been more vocal.         
	Whats your approach as coach?         
	That this game is all about the players... Theyre the ones who deserve the accolades... Im just part of the support staff... At the end of the day, the team comes foremost, not the coach... My job is to work behind the scenes and to assist the players in getting as good as they can become. Its a challenge doing that... My view is that you must accept challenges in life. I know Ill be judged by results and Im comfortable with that. You may think youve added value, but youll still be judged by results... Indeed, no coach should take the job thinking he wont be judged that way.         
	[For the record, under Kirsten, weve won five of the 12 Tests (three losses) and 14 of the 19 ODIs.]         
	Given the controversies surrounding Chappell, the last full-time coach before your appointment, were you in two minds when you got the Team India offer?         
	Not at all... I guess he did what was he was needed to do... I dont know Greg very well, but have had positive interactions in the time Ive known him... Good luck to him in whatever hes doing... Obviously, my coaching style had to be and is different... A coach has to create an environment which allows the players and the team to get better. Of course, there will be times when a coach has to make a call... Has to push a button... Tell the guys that theyve under-performed.         
	You prefer more of one-on-ones...         
	I do... One area of coaching is to draw strategy, the other is to understand the players. You cant come in and say this is the way I coach and if you dont fit in, then tough luck... Those days have gone and you need to first understand the players... My approach is to create an atmosphere where I can accommodate the ideas and thoughts of others... Also, accommodate the way they function. Any environment needs a structure and Ive put one in place... Ive involved the team as everything concerns the team.         
	Have you been influenced by any coach?         
	Duncan Fletcher was one, he was my coach at university (Cape Town)... I liked his style and have used some of his techniques... Ive learnt from others too.         
	Finally, is it an advantage or a disadvantage that you played international cricket till as recently as 2003-04, when the Irfan Pathans made their debut?         
	(Grins) Its a good question... Difficult to say... Ive tried to stay on the leading edge of coaching... Ive been into coaching for only a few years... If I may add, somebody like (hand-picked mental conditioning expert) Paddy Upton is so important... Its important to have him on board instead of getting a consultant to work for a few days every now and then.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A chorus of disapproval
                                                   A chorus of disapproval
                      
	Jacques Rogge, the president of the International Olympic Committee, on the question of the whereabouts clause, had said: Sport today has a price to pay for suspicion.         
	But some say the rules have gone too far. Indeed, BCCI isnt the first to reject the contentious testing procedure. Fifa too has turned down the Wada regime saying the rules should apply differently to team sports like football. But Fifas suggestion of collective location rules, within the scope of the team and within the stadium infrastructure, hasnt been entertained by Wada leading Fifa president Sepp Blatter to say that: We are a little bit surprised that Wada says there will be no exceptions made. It is not a question of not fighting doping but one should not really go on a witch-hunt because it has never led to a positive result.         
	Sportspersons have been critical of the rule. Here is what some of the reactions have been (alphabetically, according to discipline):         
	Athletics  Bryan Clay: If theres any way to make this less invasive for the athletes, lets try to figure that out. We want to catch the cheaters, but we also want to have a regular life, or as regular as it could be.         
	Rowing  British team members: We feel that unless the system is changed, there will be a number of clean athletes facing life bans and a higher number of clean athletes who will opt to retire rather than face the constant hassle and panic of staying on top of these requirements, and the severe penalties for tripping up. Will this system catch more cheats, or merely compromise the lives and training of clean athletes?         
	Swimming  Dara Torres: Its absolutely too much. Why make this more cumbersome when we do so much already? Were at the point where we have to find a middle ground.         
	Tennis  Andy Murray: I support drug testing but there has to be a more realistic and practical way to deal with the problem These new rules are so draconian that it makes it almost impossible to live a normal life.         
	Rafael Nadal: I think it shows a lack of respect for privacy. I think its a disgrace. These are things that completely have to change, and there is a unanimous voice on that in the locker room. It is an intolerable hunt. In the end we are humans and we do not have to feel like criminals just because we do sport.         
	Venus Williams: If your match goes to one clock at night you dont know whats going to happen You are not focusing on where you are going to be (the next morning). There are some things in the system which need to be looked at. We want a system which works and thats fair. I think its a little too intense. What person of free will is going to text their every whereabouts?

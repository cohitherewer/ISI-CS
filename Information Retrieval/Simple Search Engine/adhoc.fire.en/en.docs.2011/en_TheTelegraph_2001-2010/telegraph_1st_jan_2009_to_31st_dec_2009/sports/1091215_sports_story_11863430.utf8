	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Monday shifted the second one-dayer of the five-match series against Sri Lanka from Visakhapatnam to Nagpur.         
	While the BCCI didnt cite any reason for the shift, Sri Lanka Cricket said it was because of the prevailing situation in Visakhapatnam.         
	The second ODI of the five-match series between India and Sri Lanka has been shifted to Nagpur. The match will be a day-night affair, and will be played on the scheduled date, December 18, the BCCI said in a release.         
	According to a PTI report, police in Visakhapatnam expressed inability to provide security in the wake of the political crisis in Andhra Pradesh.

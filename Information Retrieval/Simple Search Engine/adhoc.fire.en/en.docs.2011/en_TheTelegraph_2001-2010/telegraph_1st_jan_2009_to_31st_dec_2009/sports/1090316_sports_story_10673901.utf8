                                                   Off-form not a worry: OBrien
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hamilton: New Zealand bowler Iain Brien, just like the rest of his teammates, has taken heart from the Black Caps victory over India in the last ODI Saturday. Brien agreed that his performance in the ODI series left a lot to be desired but said it was a lean patch only and that he wasnt unduly worried by the dip in form.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Has your performance dipped of late?         
	Not necessarily dipped, just taken a little curve off the road. I am not concerned about it. Just like with everything, you do go up and down, and you have good days and bad days, and I have had a couple of bad days. Doesnt change me as a bowler, doesnt change me as a person.         
	If they enjoyed playing big teams         
	This is fun this is pretty cool. Played against Australia on home grounds, it was pretty amazing. Now we get to play against another amazing team in front of home crowds, and I am really looking forward to the Test series.         
	Sehwag or Tendulkar?         
	Sehwags pretty amazing, isnt he? I didnt get to bowl to Tendulkar in Christchurch, when he was special. So you know Sehwag has been amazing.         
	On dismissing India cheaply in the last ODI         
	Its nice to dismiss them in 36.3 overs. Its a good thing to do, knock them over. The Test wickets wont be as flat as one-dayers, there will be little bit in them. Yeah, its good that we took wickets, and that we held our shape in the middle of the innings.         
	Are these the pitches you want for Tests?         
	Yes and no. Not necessarily the seam movement, but the bounce. Just nice go get a deck that has good carry and good bounce.

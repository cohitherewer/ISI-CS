The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wada seeks India government view
                                                   Wada seeks India government view
                      
	Montreal: The World Anti-Doping Agency has asked the Indian government whether it supports the stand taken by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Wadas contentious whereabouts clause.         
	Wada president John Fahey said he was still hopeful of the international cricket community, including the Indians, to come into the fold and join the global drive against doping.         
	The ICC are Wada code compliant and India is a member of the ICC. We have taken the matter up with Indian authorities and made a request if the Indian government supports the stand taken by the BCCI, Fahey said during a teleconference last night.         
	Our whole purpose and mandate is to ensure that theres harmonisation of the rules around the world including the cricket community which involves India, he added.         
	The BCCI has refused to comment. The Indian government should answer... I have no comments, chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty said in Mumbai.         
	The ICC had said that it would ask Wada to consider a cricket-specific code for the whereabouts rule after BCCI backed its players who refused to sign the clause saying it was a breach of privacy and posed security threats.         
	I think there has been and still is confusion that have not been properly informed by their anti-doping organisation or they do not fully understand the system, said Fahey.         
	Even if they have not been selected to be part of a registered testing pool, athletes can still be tested anywhere and anytime, Fahey added.         
	Fahey, however, noted that Wada would review the out-of-competition rule at the end of the year and make any necessary changes if needed.

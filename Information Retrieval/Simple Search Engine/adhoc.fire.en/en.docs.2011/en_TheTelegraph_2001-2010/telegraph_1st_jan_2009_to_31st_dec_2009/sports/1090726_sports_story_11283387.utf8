  - Awards function conserve power, beautify parks, says Gandhi         A STAFF REPORTER            Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi with Shyam Sundar Mitra at the CAB annual awards function on Saturday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh                                 
	Calcutta: The state governor, Gopalkrishna Gandhi, had some advice for the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB). One was to conserve power and the other to engage in something akin to social service  specifically, the restoration and maintenance of parks in and around the city.         
	What the governor did not say is that the CAB also needed to brush up on its spellings! Perhaps, he chose to play the perfect guest and not spoil the evening at the Eden Gardens. Also, not embarrass his host, Jagmohan Dalmiya.         
	Fact is that nobody missed the ceremoney bit, which stood out on the banner proclaiming Saturdays function  the CAB annual awards ceremony.         
	Gandhi, who is known for his voluntary power cuts in the Raj Bhavan, said: I have a suggestion for the CAB Since theres a power shortage all over the state as well as Calcutta, the CAB should refrain from using the floodlights (at Eden) when not required. That would help conserve a lot of power.         
	However, according to a CAB official, on non-match days, the floodlights are on only when theres a special directive from the government. That is during the pujas or for other security requirements.         
	The associations routine checks with the lights are rare and few and far between, added the official.         
	Drawing the state associations attention towards its social responsibility he said: The CAB is a profit-making body. It would be nice if they can allocate a part of their earnings for the conservation and restoration of the various parks in and around Calcutta.         
	However, the CAB president, Dalmiya, said that he wouldnt like to comment on the governors views. Anybody can express his or her opinion Whatever the governor said was his personal view. I wouldnt like to comment on that, he said.                     
	Among the awardees was former Bengal captain Shyam Sundar Mitra, who was honoured with the lifetime achievement award for his contribution to the game.         
	Wriddhiman Saha, adjudged the best cricketer of the year, couldnt come as the wicketkeeper is with the India A team for the Emerging Players Tournament in Australia.         
	Ranadeb Bose bagged the best fast bowler award while Ria Chowdhury was the best womens cricketer.

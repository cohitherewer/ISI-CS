                                                   Players participation puts BCCI in a fix 
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Wellington: The prospect of Sachin Tendulkar and Dinesh Karthik rubbing shoulders with Hamish Marshall, who plied his trade with the Indian Cricket League, in Fridays international Masters Twenty20 game has put the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in a spot of bother.         
	The match is a curtain-raiser to the Twenty20 International between India and New Zealand at Westpac Stadium.         
	Marshall has played for Royal Bengal Tigers in the ICL.         
	While Sachin will turn out for New Zealand Cricket Players Association (NZCPA) Masters side, which will also have Marshall, Karthik will play for the Australian Masters outfit.         
	The move, which finds support from India coach Gary Kirsten, has put the BCCI in a spot of bother.         
	The ICL doesnt have the blessings of the BCCI bosses. Ratnakar Shetty, BCCI chief administrative officer, refused to comment.         
	This is a great opportunity for Sachin and Karthik to have a few hits in the middle. We are happy to work with the Players Association to bring them into the Masters teams, said Kirsten.         
	Though NZCPA chief executive Heath Mills said Marshall was no longer contracted to the rebel league, the ICL claimed the New Zealander was still part of it.         
	Niranjan Shah, the Indian manager in New Zealand, said the BCCI would take up the matter with New Zealand Cricket.         
	No Indian player will play for a team that has an ICL player, Shah reiterated before adding that it would not be a problem if Marshall was no longer contracted with the ICL.

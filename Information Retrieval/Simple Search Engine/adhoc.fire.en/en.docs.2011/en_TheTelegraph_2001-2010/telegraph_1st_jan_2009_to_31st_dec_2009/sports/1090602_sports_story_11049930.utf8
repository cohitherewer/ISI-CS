                                                     Tough task for Vijender 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Vijender Kumar                           
	New Delhi: Ace boxer Vijender Kumar will face his toughest task since the Beijing Olympics when he leaves for Zhuhai (China) on Thursday to take part in the Asian Elite boxing championship.         
	A part of the 11-member Indian team, Vijender, who created history by clinching the bronze in the 75kg category in Beijing , would be India s best bet to win their first gold medal in 15 years.         
	Haryana pugilist Raj Kumar was the last Indian to have won a gold at the Asian meet in 1994.         
	While the All-India Boxing Association (AIBA) officials are pinning hope on Vijender, it may not be easy for the Beijing hero as he is likely to face the fury of Asias top boxers.         
	While hosts China will be in full force, leading boxers from Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Thailand are also expected to participate in the meet.         
	Speaking from the training camp in Patiala, Vijender said he was raring to go. I am practising hard at the moment and should be able to win a medal at the Asian meet.         
	After his Beijing triumph, Vijender remained outside the ring for a long time. AIBA sources said that he returned to practice only in April and did not perform too well in the invitational meet in the Czech Republic in May.         
	Overall, India are a depleted side as the two top boxers  Akhil Kumar and A.L. Lakra  have been dropped because of injuries. Apart from Vijender, world youth champion Thokchom Nanao Singh and Olympian Jitender Kumar are the other prominent members in the squad.         
	The Indian contingent: T. Nanao Singh (48kg), Suranjoy Singh (51kg), Jitender Kumar (54kg), Chhote Lal Yadav (57kg), Jai Bhagwan (60kg), Balwinder Beniwal (64kg), Jagat Singh (69kg), Vijender Kumar (75kg), Dinesh Kumar (81kg), Gurlal Singh (91kg) and Paramjeet Samota (+91kg).

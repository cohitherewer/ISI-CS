	New Delhi: The Indian footballers, on a month-long training tour of Barcelona, skipped their morning gym session Tuesday and visited the iconic Nou Camp, the home of European champions FC Barcelona.         
	Bhaichung Bhutia and Co. had been training at a ground just outside Nou Camp since their arrival in Barcelona on July 7 but Tuesday they went inside the 95000 capacity stadium and visited the museum and the souvenir shop.         
	The boys did not have morning session today. They were taken on a tour of the Barcelona facilities with a local guide and visited the Barcelona stadium, team manager Pradip Chowdhary said.         
	All the members of the team were delighted at this rare opportunity to visit Nou Camp and see the facilities for themselves, he said.         
	I like the stadium (Nou Camp). We are very lucky to have seen the stadium, the museum... It was very good, said goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya.         
	FC Barcelona also took interest in the Indian teams tour with the Barca TV crew visiting the ground Monday when the players were training. Interviews of chief coach Bob Houghton and Bhaichung were aired on Barca TV on Monday night.

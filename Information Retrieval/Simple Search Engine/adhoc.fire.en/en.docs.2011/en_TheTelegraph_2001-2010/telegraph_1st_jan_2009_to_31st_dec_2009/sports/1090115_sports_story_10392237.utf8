                                                   A warm welcome for Anand, Bindra
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The city, true to its tradition, gave Viswanathan Anand and Abhinav Bindra a warm reception on Wednesday evening on arrival for the first time after their world-winning efforts. Quite a few fans, apart from the sea of reporters, assembled at the airport to catch a glimpse of the two legends.         
	Anand was overwhelmed by the reception. I never expected such a reception. Thanks for this huge welcome, the World Champion said.         
	Surya Sekhar Ganguly is a very good player. I expect him to achieve some big things in international chess, he said, referring to the city boy who was one of his seconds in Bonn when he won the world championship for the third time, beating Vladimir Kramnik.         
	The three-time world champion also sounded optimistic about the future of Indian chess.         
	There are a lot of good young players around. It wont be long before the next Anand comes through, the world champion remarked with his trademark smile.         
	Olympic gold medallist Bindra, who landed almost an hour later, was surprised to see the crowd of mediapersons after coming out of the VIP gate. The 26-year-old could only manage a shy smile before he was put in the car and whisked away.         
	The two sporting greats arrived in the city for functions to be held on Thursday.

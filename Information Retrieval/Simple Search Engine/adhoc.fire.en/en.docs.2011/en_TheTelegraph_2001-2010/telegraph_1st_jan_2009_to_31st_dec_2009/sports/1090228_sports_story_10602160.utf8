The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI forces Indian duo to pull out
                                                   BCCI forces Indian duo to pull out
                      
	Wellington: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) forced Sachin Tendulkar and Dinesh Karthik to withdraw from an exhibition Twenty20 match here on Friday objecting to the presence of Indian Cricket League (ICL) player Hamish Marshall.         
	Both Sachin and Karthik were given permission by the touring Team India officials to play in the light-hearted tie between former Australian and New Zealand cricketers, which was billed as a curtain-raiser to the second Twenty20 match against the Black Caps at the Westpac Stadium here.         
	While Sachin was scheduled to play for the New Zealand Cricket Players Association (NZCPA) Masters side, Karthik was to play for the Australian side in the match.         
	The Indian team management withdrew both the players at the eleventh hour when the BCCI objected to the presence of Hamish Marshall, who had played for Royal Bengal Tigers in the ICL last season. Though Hamish has since ended his involvement with the unsanctioned league, the BCCI said its rule still applied.         
	The BCCI, which backs the lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL), forbids its players from competing against players involved with the ICL.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ricky wont fall for the pitch report this time
                                                   Ricky wont fall for the pitch report this time
                      
	London: Australia captain Ricky Ponting is determined not to be fooled by Edgbastons jelly pitch report that similarly had ruined their Ashes dreams four years ago and said he would better wait and watch this time.         
	In the 2005 Ashes, Ponting was flayed for bowling first without injured pacer Glenn McGrath after concerns that heavy rain would make the pitch a minefield. Four years down the lane, Ponting finds himself in a similar situation with Edgbastons groundsman Steve Rouse claiming that heavy rain has delayed the preparation of the pitch for the third Test and the wicket is a bit like a jelly.         
	But the Australian skipper said this time he will assess the pitch early next week before forming any notion.         
	Thats what we got told last time. Thats the reason we ended up bowling first in 2005, Ponting was quoted as saying in a local newspapaper. We were told exactly the same thing for the week leading up. There had been a cyclone and a tornado that had gone through Birmingham and wicket preparation was miles behind. It was overcast on that day. So we won the toss and bowled. And the thing (the ball) didnt move off the straight for the whole day.         
	Im not sure Ill be falling for that one this time around. Well wait and see, added the Australia captain.         
	Ponting is currently playing a three-day tour match against Northamptonshire and would travel to Birmingham with the side Sunday night, after the match.         
	Well have a look first thing Monday, Ponting said of the pitch. It will be a good opportunity to have a look at the wicket and see how far advanced the preparation is and then hopefully, well be able to make a more accurate forecast once were there. Last time around, we probably got a bit carried away with what we heard and not going so much on the cold, hard facts of what we saw.         
	The wicket looked ok there last time but with the overhead conditions, thats what most captains here usually look at on the day. Ive probably got a bit more experience with that this time around, he added.

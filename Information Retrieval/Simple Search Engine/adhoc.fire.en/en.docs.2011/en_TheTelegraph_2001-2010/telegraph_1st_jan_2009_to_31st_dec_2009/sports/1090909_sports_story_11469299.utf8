The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Huge milestone: Pankaj Advani
                                                   Huge milestone: Pankaj Advani
                      
	Bangalore: Ace Indian cueist Pankaj Advani, who realised his dream of winning the World Billiards Championship, said on Tuesday he has no plans to turn professional in snooker.         
	I love billiards and this is a huge milestone for me. It is very satisfying. I want to enjoy my game. I dont want to play in England for nine months. My decision may disappoint those who want me to win professional snooker titles too, the 24-year-old said.         
	He pulled off a stunning 2030-1253 win over nine-time winner Mike Russell of Qatar in the final in Leeds on Sunday to clinch the coveted trophy. Advani said that at Leeds he was tested in all departments of the game as he was playing under different conditions.         
	In this championship I was tested in all departments and thats what made this victory very special to me. First of all, we were playing in totally different conditions. In England, conditions are quite different from rest of the world, Advani said.         
	To beat Mike in England is big and satisfying. I dont have any words to express my feelings. He was unbeaten for so many years. And last two years he has been the defending champion in the same tournament at the same venue on the same table! he added.         
	Advani said he had a tough draw as he had to face veteran cuiest Geeth Sethi, the only other Indian to have won the title in the championship history.         
	I had my task cut out. It was a two-hour game. Anything can happen any moment. Quarter final and semi-final were close, he said.         
	I managed to hold my nerve well. I kept my cool. A good start was my aim as Mike needs time to warm up, he added.         
	Asked about his huge victory margin, Advani said, I am not bothered by how much margin I win. Whether I win or lose, I just want to play my game. In billiards it is consistency that matters than big breaks.         
	Advani said he was willing to join any initiative to promote the game at professional level and help those learning by giving tips but ruled out taking up coaching as his profession, saying, I am still a student of the game.         
	When asked whether he suggested any format changes in billiards and snooker games, in a lighter vein, Advani quipped, yes. The dress code should change. I can wear jacket and play.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Players bristle at control
                                                                                                                                   Players bristle at control
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Russi Jeejeebhoy was at the centre of a controversy at the Eden on Friday when a senior Bengal player complained to CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya about the Bengal managers high-handedness.         
	Some of the players were apparently unhappy with Jeejeebhoys attitude, terming it as an intrusion into their privacy.         
	Maintaining discipline is fine but he must realise all are matured adults... The situation is only getting more and more claustrophobic, said a player.         
	These are baseless rumours being spread by people who dont want good of Bengal cricket, Jeejeebhoy said.         
	A senior CAB official did admit that players were not happy with Jeejeebhoy. He (Jeejeebhoy) doesnt have any ulterior motive May be its just a communication problem which can be sorted out. One shouldnt try and read too much into it.         
	Meanwhile, the selectors appointed Laxmi Ratan Shukla captain for the whole season. Predictably Manoj Tiwary, Wriddhiman Saha and Ashok Dinda made a comeback.         
	THE SQUAD         
	Laxmi Ratan Shukla (captain), Deep Dasgupta, Arindam Das, Wriddhiman Saha, Manoj Tiwary, Abhishek Jhunjhunwala, Dibyendu Chakraborty, Sourashis Lahiri, Ranadeb Bose, Ashok Dinda, Iresh Saxena, Shib Sagar Singh, Sourav Sarkar, Arindam Ghosh, Rohan Banerjee, Sayan Sekhar Mondal.

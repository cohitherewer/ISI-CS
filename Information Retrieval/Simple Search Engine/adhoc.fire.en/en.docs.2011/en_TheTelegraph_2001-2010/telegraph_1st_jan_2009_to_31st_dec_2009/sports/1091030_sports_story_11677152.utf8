    - I-League Nabi amp; co. held by Salgaocar; Lajong FC lose 1-2             A STAFF REPORTER            Yusif Yakubu (left) and Samieinia battle for possession at the Barasat Stadium on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Just as it appeared that a moment of brilliance from Abel Hammond had secured East Bengals first victory in the I-League this season, a flash of mediocrity saw them being robbed of a well-deserved three points.         
	Salgaocar held East Bengal to a 1-1 draw at the Barasat Stadium Thursday.         
	Salgaocars Ekene Ikenwa struck in the last minute of regulation time to negate Hammonds scorcher for the hosts in the 12th minute.         
	A confidence crushing 3-5 drubbing at the hands of Mohun Bagan, a host of injuries to key players and, above all, rendered coachless after Subhas Bhowmicks resignation, East Bengal needed a victory, desperately, to pull themselves up for the rest of the season.         
	And, against Salgoacar, newly promoted to the premier tier, that should have been a fairly achievable task.         
	Things looked perfect when Hammond, gaining possession of a loose ball near the top edge of the rival box, unleashed a powerful volley which beat goalkeeper Kalyan Chowbey at the near post.         
	Yusif Yakubu was once again the most enterprising man for the red and gold brigade while new Nigerian defender Oga Opara had a decent game.         
	But in the 90th minute, East Bengal keeper Arup Debnath made a mess of a Lestor Fernandes shot and the rebound landed at a lurking Ekene Ikenwas feet who obliged by tapping it in.         
	Arup, in fact, injured his knee early in the match and was visibly in pain often clutching his knees during the match.         
	But strangely he was persisted with though they had an option in Abhra Mondal on the bench.         
	Later it was learnt that Arup had been taken to the hospital for an MRI.         
	There was also a violent outburst from the East Bengal fans who protested the disappointing result as the team were leaving the ground and the police had to intervene.         
	Teams         
	East Bengal: Arup Debnath, Nirmal Chetri, Oga Opara, Govin Singh, Jibon Singh, Abel Hammond (Wasim Feroz, 90th), Mehtab Hossan (Alvito DCunha, 78th), Mehrajuddin Wadoo, Syed Rahim Nabi, Subhas Singh (Mitrovic Srecko, 60 th), Yusif Yakubu

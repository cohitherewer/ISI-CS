The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barcelona irresistible
                                                   Barcelona irresistible
                      
	Madrid: Lionel Messi scored twice as leaders Barcelona overcame Numancia 4-1 at the Camp Nou to go 15 points clear at the top of the Primera Liga on Saturday.         
	Modest Numancia are the only team to have beaten Barcelona in the league, winning 1-0 at home on the opening day of the season, and they made life difficult for their hosts early on.         
	After the break, however, Messi, twice, Samuel Eto and Thierry Henry all scored as Pep Guardiolas side stepped up a gear, and they moved to 53 points from 20 games.         
	Jose Barkeros blistering free-kick for the visitors had made it 2-1 after 61 minutes.         
	Earlier, struggling Osasuna came back to draw 1-1 at Villarreal with a spirited performance at the Madrigal.         
	In Serie A, Juventus moved level at the top with Inter Milan when Claudio Marchisios first Serie A goal sealed a fortunate 1-0 win over Fiorentina on Saturday.         
	The 23-year-old midfielder coolly finished off Alessandro del Pieros delightful pass midway through the first half on a freezing Turin night.         
	Juventus, in their second season back in the top-flight after their 2006 demotion for match-fixing, have returned to the top on the sixth anniversary of the death of famous owner and Fiat head Gianni Agnelli. In Saturdays early game, Vincenzo Italiano smashed the ball home from distance in injury time to give Chievo a controversial 1-0 win at fellow Serie A strugglers Reggina.         
	The sides were joint-bottom before kick-off but Reggina now prop up the rest having conceded a goal moments after striker Bernardo Corradi had a second penalty appeal turned down when he was again manhandled by Chievos Davide Mandelli.

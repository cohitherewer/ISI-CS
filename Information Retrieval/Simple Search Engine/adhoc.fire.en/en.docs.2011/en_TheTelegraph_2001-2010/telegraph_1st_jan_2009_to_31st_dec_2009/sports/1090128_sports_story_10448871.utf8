The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Losing captaincy put me off: Kevin
                                                   Losing captaincy put me off: Kevin
                      
	London: Kevin Pietersen got a lot of satisfaction after hitting a century against St Kitts and Nevis on Monday. However, the loss of captaincy to Andrew Strauss still haunts him.         
	It is unfortunate that the captaincy was taken away from me. Its one of my frustrations that what I wanted, he (Strauss) has got, Pietersen said.         
	Pietersen hammered a modest St Kitts and Nevis to score 103 runs from 91 balls, with 13 fours and three sixes and then got himself stumped.         
	I was told to (get out). Strauss is the boss and I have no dramas with that.         
	He provided a glimpse of the anger that still burns within him, following his much-publicised spat with former coach Peter Moores.         
	Getting back to playing cricket was something I wanted to do, he said.         
	I just wanted to get back to playing cricket, to get back in the dressing room with the lads. To get a hundred after everything thats happened was pretty satisfying. Its been frustrating because I did everything by the book, everything I was supposed to do.         
	The former England captain also expressed disappointment at the way the media handled the issue and the hurt he felt for being removed from the captains chair.         
	What you guys (the media) did to me for a couple of weeks really hurt me. Times a great healer but Id like a few questions to be answered first. I loved doing the job. And I thought we were going in the right direction, the direction that I wanted to take the team, Pietersen said.         
	Pietersen also said that he is slowly getting back to terms with what happened in recent weeks and playing will help heal the process.

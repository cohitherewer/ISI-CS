The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bravo steals the show
                                                   Bravo steals the show
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Yuvraj Singh celebrated his return to the India vice-captaincy albeit in a stand-in capacity. The swashbuckling left-hander rescued a tottering India and helped his team post a fighting total against the West Indies at Lords in their first match of the Super Eight stage on Friday.               
	Chasing 154, the West Indies reached the target in 18.4 overs with seven wickets in hand. Dwayne Bravo was unbeaten on 66. Lendl Simmons made 44               
	India posted 153 for seven after captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni won the toss and decided to bat first. Yuvraj scored 67 off 43 balls with six boundaries and two sixes to rescue India after they were reduced to 66 for four at one stage, reeling from some fiery fast bowling from Fidel Edwards (three for 24) and Dwayne Bravo (four for 38).         
	Yuvraj drove and flicked with elan and was ferocious with his cuts and pulls.         
	The belligerent left-hander anchored Indias late surge which took them to the fighting total. In fact, India scored 72 runs off the last six overs with Yuvraj scoring 34 runs off his last 11 balls. The only blemish in Yuvrajs innings came when he flicked Bravo straight to Andre Fletcher at square leg, who put the catch down.         
	Yusuf Pathan provided able support to Yuvraj with a 23-ball knock of 31. He added 64 runs for the fifth wicket with Yuvraj in only 33 balls. Harbhajan Singhs 13 off four balls provided some late entertainment as he hit the last three balls of the innings from Bravo for boundaries to take India past the 150-run mark.         
	Indian batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar was present at Lords for the last few overs to cheer his team. Opener Rohit Sharma (5) fell while trying to pull Edwards, caught by Lendl Simmons at square leg.         
	Suresh Raina (5) walked in at No. 3 instead of captain Dhoni. Edwards softened him up with a string of deliveries, over the 150 kmph mark, aimed at his rib cage.         
	The West Indies pacer pitched up the fifth delivery of his second over a touch away from Rainas body and the left-hander just hung his bat out to get a healthy edge to wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin.         
	India were reduced to 29 for three in no time and limped to 40 for three in the first six overs of Powerplay, during which they managed to hit only four boundaries.         
	Dhoni and Yuvraj did the rebuilding job and stitched together a slow but steady partnership of 37 runs from 47 deliveries.

                                                     Dipendu scores in Md. Sp. victory 
            A STAFF REPORTER            Dipendu Biswas celebrates after scoring against Lajong at the Mohun Bagan ground on Sunday.   A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: The hot air balloon, kept at the centre of the park for the IFA Shield inauguration, did not take off. But Mohammedan Sportings campaign did as the black and white brigade made a winning start defeating Lajong FC 1-0 at the Mohun Bagan ground Sunday.         
	Comeback man Dipendu Biswas, playing a full 90 minute match after a long time, scored the all-important goal in the 14th minute.         
	Brazilian recruit Edu Escobar, who arrived in town only a couple of days back, did all the hard work  leaving his marker Aiborlang Khonjee for dead at the far end  and Dipendu was at the right place at the right time to tap it home. The goal though was contentious as the striker and Satyajit Bose were seemingly in an off-side position.         
	The Lajong players did voice their protest but were asked to carry on with the game by their coach Stanley Rozario.         
	Anyway, three points from the season opener, that too in front of a boisterous crowd, should come as a relief for coach Shabbir Ali and his boys, but its debatable whether they will get a good nights sleep.         
	For the youngsters from Shillong had them on the mat for most of the 45 minutes after the change of ends. It was only some excellent work under the bar by Naseem Akhtar that saved Mohammedan Sportings day.         
	Thrice Naseem came to his teams rescue. He was smart enough to stop Aiborlangs attempt at the near end and, then, he twice fisted away long rangers from Boithang Hoakip and Daniel Bidemi.         
	He made some crucial saves, otherwise the scoreline could have been different, Lajong coach Rozario conceded after the match.         
	Edu, in fact, could have got a memorable first day first show in the 69th minute. Edu was brought down inside the box by Daniel and referee A. Arjunan had no hesitation in pointing to the dreaded spot.         
	Dipendu wanted a brace and asked for the ball, Edu wanted his name on the scoresheet. After a brief animated conversation it was decided that the Brazilian would go for it. But Lajong keeper Gumpe Rime had other ideas and anticipated it correctly to deny Edu his moment under the sun.

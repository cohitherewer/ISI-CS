The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ian for Bravo as WI captain
                                                     Ian for Bravo as WI captain
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Dwayne Bravo                           
	London: Ian Chappell, inarguably one of the greatest captains of all time, feels that all-rounder Dwayne Bravo would be best suited to lead the West Indies.         
	Chris Gayle, after all, comes through as being reluctant.         
	Bravo would be my choice... Hes very competitive and wants the ball in his hand when the going is tough... He also wants to bat in challenging situations... Hes an aggressive cricketer, one who thinks positively...         
	I dont see why he cant captain the West Indies... He gives the impression of being out there to compete and, for me, thats not a bad starting point for a captain, Ian told The Telegraph.         
	The other day, while assessing the Test captains for our readers, Ian had said: Youve got a problem when the captain (Gayle) basically indicates that he doesnt want to be there... That hes just keeping the seat warm for somebody...         
	For the record, wicket-keeper Denesh Ramdin is the West Indies vice-captain.

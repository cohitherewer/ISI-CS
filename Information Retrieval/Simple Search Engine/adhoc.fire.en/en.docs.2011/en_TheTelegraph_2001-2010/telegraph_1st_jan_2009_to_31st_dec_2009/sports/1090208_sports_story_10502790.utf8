	Calcutta: East Bengal returned to winning ways after five matches in the ONGC I-League on Saturday. At the Salt Lake Stadium, they rode goals from Yusif Yakubu, Sunil Chetri and Sanju Pradhan to a 3-1 victory over Air India in a 14th round encounter.         
	Air India, who had won the first leg encounter between the two teams and came close to scoring on a couple of occasions, pulled one back towards the close through Subhash Singh, but by then it was curtains for the Mumbai outfit.         
	It took East Bengal 85 days to bring the smiles back on the faces of their supporters. The victory against Sporting Clube de Goa, by a similar margin, had been achieved under their former coach Stanley Rozario.         
	The start wasnt that rosy, though, for Subhas Bhowmicks men. A litany of fumbles and miss passes saw East Bengal fail to open the goalmouth and that resulted in a barren first session. Lack of support and co-ordination upfront also added to their woes.         
	What really brought about the change in the second session was East Bengals propensity to use the flanks more often. Their attacks had till then been getting lost in the maze of legs inside the rival penalty area. Their ploy to unsettle the rival defence with aerial balls also made no impact.         
	The introduction of Sanju Pradhan upfront forced Air India to stretch their defence resulting in gaping holes in the striking zone. Mehrajuddin Wadoo was pushed into the defence allowing more free space for Mehtab Hossain and Rennedy Singh.         
	Rennedy was the livewire in the midfield with his measured passes and intelligent use of the width. It was in the fitness of things that he had a role to play in two of the three goals on the day.         
	East Bengal got going from the outset in the second half. Yakubu seemed to have suddenly woken up from slumber as he raced down the right, capitalising on a pass from Sanju, covered a good 25 yards before slotting home past an advancing goalie.         
	That was in the 48th minute and it seemed to open the floodgates. Chetri struck two minutes later. The striker, back from trials at Coventry City, latched on to a Rennedy lob inside the penalty area, shielded his marker well and placed it to the left of Arup Debnath.         
	East Bengal seized control as Air India struggled to keep the marauding rival forwards at bay. Yakubus freekick hit the crosspiece and Debnath put a firm Rennedy volley away in the nick of time.         
	Rennedy was at it again, this time his dangerously dipping centre from an acute angle on the left corner was palmed away by Debnath only to find an onrushing Sanju. The forward made no mistake as he bulged the netting with a firm volley.         
	East Bengal now have 16 points while Air India are on 17.

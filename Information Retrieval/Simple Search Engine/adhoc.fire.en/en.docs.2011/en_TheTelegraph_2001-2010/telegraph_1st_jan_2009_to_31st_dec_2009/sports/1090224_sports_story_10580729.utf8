	Calcutta: City-based Ashit Luthra on Monday took over as the president of the Indian Golf Union (IGU), at its annual general meeting at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club.         
	Luthra took over from T.T. Jagannathan, in whose tenure changes were initiated to boost the growth of the game.         
	Outling his vision, the new president stressed on the need for improved infrastructure, said: The way forward for Indian golf is to increase the base of the pyramid. We have to work towards attracting more and more talented youngsters.

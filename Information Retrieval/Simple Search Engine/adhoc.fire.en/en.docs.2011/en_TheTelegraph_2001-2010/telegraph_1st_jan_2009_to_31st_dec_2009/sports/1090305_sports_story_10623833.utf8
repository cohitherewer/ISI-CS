The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England could be the neutral venue
                                                   England could be the neutral venue
                      
	Melbourne: England could be the possible neutral venue for staging the Test series between Australia against Pakistan.         
	Cricket Australia spokesman Peter Young said the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had initiated the discussions about the Test matches going ahead in England several weeks before Tuesdays terror attack.         
	Pakistan has accepted for some time that we arent able to visit because of the safety and security concerns in that nation, Young said.         
	Pakistan has started the discussion about playing three Test matches at neutral venues in England in 2010, he was quoted as saying by a news agency.         
	Its a work in progress, the PCB is responsible for coming up with the arrangements, but in principle weve been comfortable and (were) talking with them. But it is very early days, he added.

                                                   Ferguson injury
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Australia batsman Callum Ferguson has suffered an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) and will undergo surgery next week.         
	Cricket Australia (CA) Monday announced through a press release that scans and specialist consultation have confirmed Fergusons injury.         
	CAs Dr Trefor James said: Callum underwent scans in Adelaide on Friday and saw a specialist on Saturday. After consultation with CA medical staff, it was decided the best course of action is for him to have an ACL knee reconstruction. This procedure is likely to keep him out of the game for 6-12 months.         
	Pacer Nathan Bracken also underwent surgery on Friday.         
	Dr James said: Bracken had arthroscopic right knee surgery on Friday. Surgery went as expected and he will commence rehabilitation immediately.

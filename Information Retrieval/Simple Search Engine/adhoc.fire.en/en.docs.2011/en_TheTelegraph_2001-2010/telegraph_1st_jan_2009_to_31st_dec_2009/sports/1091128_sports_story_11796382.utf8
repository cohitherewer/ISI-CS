                                                                                                                       7                                        Superb De Villiers flays England
                  AB de Villiers in Cape Town on Friday                     
	Cape Town: AB de Villiers hit a dazzling century as South Africa set out to end a string of defeats in the third ODI against England at Newlands Friday.               
	At midnight, England were 184 for the loss of five wickets in 31 overs. Paul Collingwood (57) and Matt Prior (13) were at the crease               
	De Villiers hit 121 off only 85 balls as South Africa piled up 354 for six, a record total in matches between the two countries, in ideal batting conditions.         
	South African captain Graeme Smith and Hashim Amla set the tone with an opening partnership of 107 off 111 balls and de Villiers pressed home the advantage with a remarkable innings.         
	South Africa were seeking their first win in eight matches against England after six defeats and one no-result.         
	De Villiers played some audacious strokes, particularly in the batting power play as he closed in on his fourth one-day international century, at one stage flicking fast bowler Stuart Broad over the head of wicketkeeper Matt Prior for one of his 14 boundaries.         
	There were only 20 balls in his innings from which he failed to score.         
	Smith was in dominant mood after winning the toss for the sixth successive time at Newlands, a ground where 20 out of 25 day-night matches have been won by the side batting first.         
	Smith muscled his way to 54 off 56 balls.

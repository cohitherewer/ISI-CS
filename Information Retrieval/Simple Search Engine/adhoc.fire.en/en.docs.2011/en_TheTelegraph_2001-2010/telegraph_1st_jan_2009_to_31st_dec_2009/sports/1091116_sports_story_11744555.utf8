	London: France, Portugal and Russia all moved closer to next years World Cup finals with first leg playoff wins on Saturday. France, runners-up in Germany in 2006, beat Ireland 1-0 in Dublin with a late deflected goal from Nicolas Anelka, and start as favourites to finish the job in Paris on Wednesday.         
	Portugal beat Bosnia 1-0 in Lisbon with defender Bruno Alves heading the only goal in the first half, while two goals from Diniyar Bilyaletdinov put Russia 2-0 up against Slovenia who scored a vital away goal three minutes from time when substitute Nejc Pecnik headed home to make the final score 2-1.         
	Greece and Ukraine drew 0-0 in the first leg of their playoff in Athens, with Ukraine now favourites to take control of the tie at home in Donetsk on Wednesday.         
	New Zealand reached the World Cup for the first time since 1982, with Cameroon and Nigeria also qualifying Saturday for next years showcase in South Africa. Algeria were seconds from qualifying in Cairo, but Emad Meteab headed in a goal in the fifth minute of second-half injury time, giving Egypt a 2-0 victory over the visitors that forces a tiebreaker playoff between them on Wednesday in Sudan.         
	Egyptian fans greeted the Algerian team at the airport on Thursday by pelting its bus with stones, and Algerian officials said two team members had been injured. On Saturday, both Khaled Lemmouchia and Rafik Halliche wore head bandages while playing.         
	We played under warlike conditions, Algerian Football Association president Mohammed Rawrawa said.         
	It was difficult to perform well, but we will win on Wednesday in Sudan because the atmosphere will be calmer.         
	France won 1-0 at Ireland on a deflected goal by Nicolas Anelka.         
	We have seen that the Irish team are a very difficult team to beat, said French forward Thierry Henry, who is bidding to play at his fourth World Cup.         
	They didnt lose a game in qualification, so what we did tonight is nice. But its still 90 minutes to go, and its going to be a tough game for us in Paris.         
	In the first leg of the South American-North and Central American and Caribbean playoff, Uruguay beat 10-man Costa Rica 1-0 on Diego Luganos 23rd-minute goal, giving Uruguay, a two-time world champion, the big advantage in the second leg at home in Montevideo.         
	Twenty-six of the 32 World Cup berths are set, with the remainder settled on Wednesday. The draw dividing the teams into eight first-round groups is on December 4. At Wellington, Rory Fallon scored on a header off a corner kick in the 44th minute, and New Zealand held on to beat Bahrain 1-0.         
	The teams finished scoreless at Manama on Oct. 10 in the first leg between the Oceania champions and the fifth-placed team in Asian qualifying.         
	Bahrain, who have never appeared in the World Cup, lost a playoff to Trinidad and Tobago four years ago.         
	They could have tied the aggregate score in the 50th minute  and moved ahead on away goals  but Sayed Adnan took a weak penalty kick that was easily saved by goalkeeper Mark Paston, who fell on the ball. It came after Tony Lochhead brought Abdulla Omar down in the penalty area.         
	I basically just guessed which way hed go, and the ball ended up in my hands, Paston said. Its a bit surreal really.         
	Nigeria, who missed the 2002 tournament, overtook Tunisia on the final day of their campaign by coming from behind to win 3-2 against Kenya in Nairobi.         
	Obafemi Martins scored twice for the Super Eagles, who qualified thrice straight, starting 1994, before falling short for the 2006 tournament.         
	Nigeria finished first in Group B with 12 points, one ahead of Tunisia, who lost 0-1 at Mozambique.         
	Dennis Oliech put Kenya ahead in the 16th minute when he beat goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama with a low shot. Martins tied it in the 62nd off a pass from Peter Odemwingie, and Nigeria went ahead three minutes later when Ayegbeni Yakubu hit a post and converted the rebound.         
	Allan Wetende retied it when he scored off a header in the 79th, but Martins scored again in the 83rd.         
	At Maputo, Dario scored in the 83rd minute as Mozambique thwarted Tunisia, who tasted their first loss in qualifying since the opener in June 2008.         
	Tunisia have appeared in four World Cups, including the last three.         
	In Cairo, Amr Zaki scored in the second minute and Meteab, who entered in the 65th, got the goal that forced the playoff. Egypt and Algeria finished tied atop Group C with 4-1-1 records, nine for, four against and a 1-1 head-to-head record.

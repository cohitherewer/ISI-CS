                                                                                                                                                                   I rsquo;ve earned   my place: Bopara
    London: Ravi Bopara has hit back at Shane Warne for doubting his credentials for the highest level, stressing that he has earned his place in the England squad for the Ashes.
    ldquo;Over the last couple of months I rsquo;ve earned my place in the team. I rsquo;ve always wanted to bat in the top order. To do it against the best in the world will be a great challenge for me, rdquo; he was quoted as saying by an English daily.
    Warne had last week said Bopara is ldquo;not an international cricketer rdquo; because he ldquo;can be put off his game too easily and he rsquo;s too worried about how he looks rdquo;.
    Akram advice
    New Delhi: Mohammed Aamer, Pakistan rsquo;s find in the Twenty20 World Cup, has all the attributes of a good pacer but needs to put on some weight to survive the rigour of international cricket, said former captain Wasim Akram.
    ldquo;Look out for this young man. He is definitely promising. For someone who can consistently bowl at 90 miles an hour, Aamer is definitely cut out for pace bowling. He is tall and need to put on some weight to gain extra power, rdquo; Akram said. 
    Sanjay rsquo;s view
    New Delhi: Pakistan captain Younis Khan rsquo;s decision to quit Twenty20 cricket is ill-timed and would end up being counterproductive for the game in his country, feels former Indian batsman Sanjay Manjrekar.
    ldquo;At a time when Pakistan is resurrecting themselves, Younis rsquo; decision does not bode well. It is ill-timed. ldquo;I don rsquo;t understand the logic behind it. Pakistan need good leadership, rdquo; Manjrekar said.
    Pak reception
    Karachi: Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gillani will host a grand reception in Islamabad Wednesday for the Twenty20 World Cup winning team. The Prime Minister rsquo;s secretariat announced the Premier would be holding a reception for the players to celebrate their achievement. 
    Fans angry 
    Karachi: Thousands of cricket fans returned home disappointed and angry from the Allama Iqbal airport in Lahore early Tuesday without getting a chance to catch a glimpse of their T20 World Cup heroes.
    The fans, who danced to drum beats and raised slogans while waiting for hours at and outside the airport to welcome the T20 World Cup winners, got a rude shock when they learnt that the players were taken away to the National Cricket Academy from a side entrance.
    ICC praise
    Dubai: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has praised the behaviour of the players and the positive influence of the match officials during the just-concluded World Twenty20 in England. ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said throughout the 17-day meet, which for the first time included a women rsquo;s section running in conjunction with the men rsquo;s event, there was not a single formal code of conduct issue for any of the players.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev finishes at tied sixth
                                                   Jeev finishes at tied sixth
                      
	Newport: Jeev Milkha Singh finished at tied sixth with a 69 in the last round at the Wales Open on Sunday. Denmarks Jeppe Huldahl, ranked 377th in the world, completed a surprise win.         
	A faultless closing four-under-par 67 for a nine-under 275 four-round total by the player lying 188th on the European rankings coming into the event left Huldahl one stroke better than six-times tour winner Niclas Fasth of Sweden (66).         
	Huldahl, 26, shared the lead when the weather-affected third round was finished on Sunday morning and moved a shot ahead on his own by the turn before immediately coming under pressure from the experienced Fasth. A chip-in eagle on the 11th helped Fasth catch Huldahl and he still shared the lead after 15 holes. However, a combination of bogeys on 16 and 17 by the Swede and a composed finish by the Dane earned him the first prize.

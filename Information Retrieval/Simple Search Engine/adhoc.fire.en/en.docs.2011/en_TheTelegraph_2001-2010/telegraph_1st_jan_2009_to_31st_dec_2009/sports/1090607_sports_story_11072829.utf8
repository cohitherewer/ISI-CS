The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Federer is wary of Soderling 
                                                   Federer is wary of Soderling 
                      
	Paris: With no Rafael Nadal to torment him from the other side of the net in Sundays French Open final, Roger Federer must be thinking that this must be his year to win the elusive Musketeers Cup.         
	Right? Wrong.

	As his voyage of discovery heads towards its final leg, Federer knows the stakes could not get much higher than the records that are on the line on Sunday. Im excited, because I know that these moments will not happen every single day, Federer added.         
	Ill try and do is focus on the match. Ill do my best, play my best tennis on clay, and I hope that I can win the cup. Clearly Im the favourite but this doesnt mean much. Such a final with pressure on both sides. He doesnt know what a Grand Slam final is ... but hes got nothing to lose. This is a very open match.         
	While Federer will contest the 19th major final of his glittering career, Soderling will experience his first. The 23rd seed has no misconceptions about just how much of an underdog he is for Sundays match, but in case anyone had forgotten, he said: I think Nadal was favorite against me, as well, so...

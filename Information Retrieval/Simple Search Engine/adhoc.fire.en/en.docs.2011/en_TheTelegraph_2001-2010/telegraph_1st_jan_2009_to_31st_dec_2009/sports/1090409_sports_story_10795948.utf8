The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Norman impressed by Jeev
                                                   Norman impressed by Jeev
                      
	Augusta: Jeev Milkha Singhs Masters campaign this week would still remain memorable irrespective of where he finds himself on Sundays leaderboard. Legend Greg Normans praise would be ringing in his ears for the rest of his life.         
	Jeev had his practice round with Norman before the major and he seemed to have made an impression on the Australian legend, who predicted the Indian would force his way into the International Team for the Presidents Cup later this year.         
	I was impressed, said Norman. I was surprised to see how far he hits the golf ball. Hes sneaky long, which is a big advantage on this golf course obviously. I asked him point-blank how are you playing and he said Im playing very well.         
	You dont hear too many players come out openly and say Im playing very well. Hes very confident about his game and Im looking forward for good things from him this week, said the golfer known as The Shark.         
	Jeev, who is hoping to become the first Indian to play in the Presidents Cup which pits the Norman-led International Team against the United States, is currently lying in 10th place in the team standings.         
	The top-10 players after the PGA championship in August will earn automatic entry into the team with Norman selecting two more as captains picks.         
	Ive watched Jeev from afar, through TV and reading his scores wherever he plays. He plays a lot of golf, probably more than Vijay Singh, quite honestly, and Vijay plays a lot of golf, Norman said.         
	You have to admire Jeev. He wants to get on the Presidents Cup team and he was very open about that with me. If he keeps doing what hes doing, hes going to be on it with respect, be it as a captains choice or an automatic entrant, he added.

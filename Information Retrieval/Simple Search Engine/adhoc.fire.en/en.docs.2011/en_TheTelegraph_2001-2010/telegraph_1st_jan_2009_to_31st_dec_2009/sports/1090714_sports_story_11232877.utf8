The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhutia case still in limbo
                                                   Bhutia case still in limbo
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The ongoing row between Bhaichung Bhutia and Mohun Bagan is set to get further complicated as the Players Status Committee (PSC) is likely to ask the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to refer the matter back to the Indian Football Association (IFA).         
	According to sources, at least two members of the PSC have already written to AIFF saying they are in no position to rule on the case unless the IFA makes its stand clear. The views of the other three members are awaited.         
	Out of the five members, two have enquired about IFAs opinion, sources said. They feel the IFA is the deciding authority and should be able to spell out its preferences on the issue.         
	Sources indicated that things could come to a standstill as the PSC may force the AIFF to send the matter back to the IFA for a decision.         
	To call for the PSCs opinion without knowing the IFAs stand wasnt a wise step in the first place, sources commented. It was bound to backfire. It only put the AIFF in an embarrassing position.         
	Some members feel the AIFF should have realised PSCs limitations before referring the matter to them.         
	According to these members there was no need for involving the PSC. The suspension of Bhaichung is a state matter that should be decided by the IFA only, a member said.

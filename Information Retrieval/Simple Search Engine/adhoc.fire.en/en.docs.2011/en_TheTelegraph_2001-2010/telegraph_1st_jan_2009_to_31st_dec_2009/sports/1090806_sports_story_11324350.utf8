                                                     Dev Varman stuns Cilic 
    - Defending champion Del Potro rallies to move into 3rd Round                 Indias Somdev Dev Varman after his victory against Croatias Marin Cilic in Washington on Tuesday. (AFP)                           
	Washington: Somdev Dev Varman registered the biggest win of his career when the Indian upstaged sixth-seeded Marin Cilic in straight sets in the second round of the $1.4 million Legg Mason Tennis Classic here.         
	The Indian qualifier, who lost to Cilic in his maiden ATP final in the Chennai Open earlier this year, took one hour and 42 minutes to send the Croatian packing 7-5, 6-4.         
	Somdev reached the third round where he would meet either the big-hitting Croatian Ivo Karlovic or German Rainer Schuettler.         
	Its definitely the biggest win of my career.         
	Hes a great player. Hes in the top 15 already and on his way to the top 10, Somdev gushed after the win.         
	All along I played well. My plan was to compete as hard as possible.         
	I took my chance and Im proud of the result, said Somdev who saved five of the seven break points that his opponent had.         
	Cilic had ended Somdevs dream run in January in Chennai, where the 24-year-old had reached his first ATP final.         
	Somdev said he did not have any butterflies in the stomach in the second round match and neither was he out to settle an old score.         
	It wasnt my first Tour final tonight (Tuesday) so I wasnt as nervous going out, said the 153rd-ranked Indian.         
	But there was no revenge factor in play for my loss to him in Chennai.         
	There were no ill feelings. We were just two competitors out there today (Tuesday), Somdev added.         
	Somdev, who won the NCAA singles titles in 2007-08 while playing collegiate tennis at nearby University of Virginia, said competing in the qualifying rounds gave him an advantage against Cilic.         
	I already had three matches under my belt and this was his first match of the tournament.         
	I just wanted to go out there and play my game, compete as hard as I could and let the chips fall where they may, said the youngster.         
	Having played a lot of tennis at the University of Virginia, Somdev had enough support from the stands and if he can pull off a couple of more surprises, he might run into top seed Andy Roddick in the quarter-finals of the hardcourt event.         
	Andy who? quipped Somdev.               
	On a more serious note, he said: Ive put in a lot of work. Im doing things the right way.         
	Ill take a deep breath when I have some breathing space, said Somdev who played four matches in as many days.         
	Defending champion Juan Martin del Potro came from a set down to beat Taiwans Yen-sun Lu on Tuesday and advance to the round of 16 of the meet.         
	The Argentine, seeded second, was given a bye to the second round where he met a more match-conditioned Lu and it showed in the opening set before Del Potro recovered to win 4-6, 6-3, 6-2.         
	In the other second-round matches, Tomas Berdych, the eighth-seeded Czech, downed Lativas Ernests Gulbis 6-2, 7-6 (10-8) and Germanys Tommy Haas edged past Canadian Frank Dancevic 6-1, 4-6, 6-4.         
	In a match that started late Tuesday night and ended well past midnight, Del Potro lost the opening set after dropping his serve at 3-3.         
	He stormed back with his own break at 4-3 in the second and after breaking Lu to open the third, the 2008 champion finished off the long night by winning 16 of 18 service points.         
	Haas, after cruising in the first set, went down 1-4 in the second before winning three straight games, but left the door open by failing to convert any of five break points in the next game.         
	Dancevic held and then broke Haas to win the set.         
	Next thing you know its the third set and its a battle, Haas said.         
	Anything can happen in the third set. He started to believe that maybe he could win.         
	But somehow I hung in there, played some good points at the right time.         
	Haas broke at 3-3 in the final set and closed out a match he was not aware that he was going to play until he woke Tuesday. I didnt think I was going to play until (Wednesday) because thats what I was originally told, said Haas, who reached the semi-finals in this event last year, he said.

            A STAFF REPORTER            Action during the Chirag United versus Kalighat Milan Sangha match at the Mohun Bagan ground on Monday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Chirag United missed chances galore but still managed to log full points against Kalighat Milan Sangha in a CFL Premier Division match at the Mohun Bagan ground on Monday.         
	Gauranga Biswas scored the all-important goal in the 53rd minute. It was Chirags fourth victory in five matches and they now have 13 points. Gaurangas angular back-header off a Shylo Malsawmtluanga inswinging free-kick gave hardly a chance to Kalighat MS goalkeeper Sourav Chakraborty.         
	Surprisingly, Sourav was adjudged the Man of the Match despite hardly doing anything to write home about.         
	Chirag on Monday were at their profligate best. And the man who led the charge was none other than Brazilian Joshimar.         
	Time and again wide man Shylo Malsawmtluangas deliveries found the Brazilian in goalscoring positions, but somehow Joshimar could not capitalise on those. He also held onto the ball a wee bit long inside the box and that allowed the rival defenders to close him down.         
	Malsawmtluanga himself was guilty of missing clear chance in the 20th minute when he had rival goalkeeper Sourav at his mercy. Gauranga in fact could have got his second but his powerful header off a Malsawmtluanga cross hit the post.         
	Kalighat MS also had a chance to equalise but Tanmoy Kundus shot went straight to goalkeeper Sandip Nandy

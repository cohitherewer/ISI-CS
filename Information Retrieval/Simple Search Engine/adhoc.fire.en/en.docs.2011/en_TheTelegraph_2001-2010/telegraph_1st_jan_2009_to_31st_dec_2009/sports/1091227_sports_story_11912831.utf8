The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAs bid to preserve youngsters
                                                                                                                       7                                      CAs bid to preserve youngsters
                      
	Melbourne: In a bid to discourage youngsters from joining the lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL), Cricket Australia (CA) is mulling over increasing their contract values, according to a report.         
	Young players like Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Marsh, Josh Hazlewood and Usman Khawaja will represent good value for IPL franchises who are increasingly not inclined to spend up on big names.         
	Exciting NSW rookie Steve Smith is certain to command attention from IPL franchises after his role in the Blues Champions League victory, a report in an Australian daily said.         
	The plan was formulated before a recent Australian Cricketers Association poll of contracted players which suggested 22 per cent would be prepared to turn down a CA deal to have a freelance Twenty20 career.         
	Brad Haddin, Michael Clarke and Doug Bollinger are three Aussie Test players expected to be offered huge sums to follow their teammates into the IPL, according to the report.         
	Each signing, however, has the potential to weaken CAs ownership of its stars. When the IPL started it said there was no intention of interfering with the sovereignty of International Cricket Council member nations, but cracks have started to appear, it said.

            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: Credit Squeeze may be hard to beat in the 1,400m Hilliard Cup, the main event in Sundays eight-event card. Trainer Bharath Singhs prized horse, who narrowly lost the Monsoon Derby to Gloriosa after his facile victory in the Colts Stakes, is up against seasoned performers. The Young Senor-Annella colt is definitely short on experience in the handicap race but his light-impost of 47kg gives him a definite edge over the rest in the field to take up the challenge. The western India-based jockey Dashrath Singh partners the three-year-old colt.          
	The Wheels Cup, over 1,200m, may witness a close contest between Bharaths Galashiels and, brother Vijay-trained Areology. There is little to choose between the two but Areologys monsoon form tilts the scales in his favour.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

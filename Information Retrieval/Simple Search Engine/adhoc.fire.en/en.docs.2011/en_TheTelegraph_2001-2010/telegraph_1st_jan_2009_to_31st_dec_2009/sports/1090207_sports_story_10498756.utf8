                                                   Title for Himmat 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Delhi golfer Himmat Singh Rai lifted his first professional trophy with victory in the Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI) Players Championship at the Tollygunge Club on Friday.         
	The 21-year-old thus becomes the youngest professional winner on Aircel-PGTI with a final round of 69 that took his tournament total to nine under 271 followed by Sanjay Kumar at seven under 273. City golfer S.S.P. Chowrasia however, managed to climb one place to finish third at six under 274.         
	Himmat Singh (65, 70, 67, 69), the overnight leader, dominated the Day IVs proceedings with accurate tee shots on the second and eighth (both par 3s) that set up birdies for him.         
	Sanjay managed to catch up with him after the former bogeyed the 12th and 14th holes. Himmat three-putted from just off the green on the 12th and followed that up with another three-putt from 15 feet (downhill) on the 14th.         
	The turning point came when Himmat once again grabbed the sole lead after making a 25 feet birdie putt on the 16th. Sanjay posted his second successive runner-up finish and now leads the PGTI Order of Merit. In the final round, the 37-year-old came up with birdies on the second and seventh and bogeys on the ninth and 18th.         
	Its like a dream come true for me. In fact, the victory hasnt sunk in as yet. I was a little nervous at the start of the round today but the birdie on the second helped me settle down into my rhythm. I played solid from then on. I then had to struggle for a brief period from the 12th to the 14th.         
	The 25 feet birdie putt that I made on the 16th turned out to be very crucial because it gave me the lead with just two more holes to go, said Himmat.         
	Veteran Mukesh Kumar (67, 71, 71, 66) finished five-under 275 to be fourth placed while city duo of Feroz Ali Mollah and Raju Ali Mollah were tied eighth at even par 280.

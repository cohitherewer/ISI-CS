The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Historic win for Pacquiao 
                                                   Historic win for Pacquiao 
                      
	Las Vegas: Filipino southpaw Manny Pacquiao knocked out Britains Ricky Hatton just before the end of the second round to match a boxing record with a title in a sixth career weight class.         
	Pacquiao slammed a powerful left hand into Hattons chin to buckle the Englishmans knees and send him down to the canvas on his back unconscious Saturday.         
	Referee Kenny Bayless knelt over the unmoving Hatton and halted the fight after two minutes and 59 seconds of the second round, giving the Filipino star a victory and the International Boxing Organization junior welterweight title.         
	Everybody is surprised. Me too. I didnt expect this would be so easy, Pacquiao said. But I have worked hard in training camp. Nothing personal.         
	Pacquiao, seen as the world pound-for-pound champion, won his 10th fight in a row, improving to 49-3 with two drawn with his 37th early stoppage. Hatton fell to 45-2, losing at junior welterweight for the first time in his career.         
	Pacquiao was coming off a victory last December over Oscar De la Hoya that cemented his place as boxings pound-for-pound champion, even though a newly unretired Floyd Mayweather Jnr might one day make him prove the point again. This was as big for me as the De la Hoya fight, he said.         
	Pacquiao knocked Hatton down twice in an electrifying first round, the first time with a left to the chin 30 seconds into the fight and the next with a combination near the end of the round.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dada is a dude: SRK
                                                   Dada is a dude: SRK
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly may no longer be the captain of the Kolkata Knight Riders, but principal owner Shah Rukh Khan feels the former India skipper is still vital to the teams chances in the ongoing IPL.         
	Dada is fantastic He does not need to prove it to anyone how great a player he is. We know it in the KKR. Hes the main cog of our team. Hes the guy the team centres around, Shah Rukh said in praise of Sourav.         
	(Brendon) McCullum, (Chris) Gayle, Brad (Hodge), David (Hussey), Ishant (Sharma), (Ashok) Dinda, Laxmi Ratan (Shukla) all feel the support from him, feel his intelligence, feel his winning ways. Dada is a dude, Shah Rukh was quoted as saying by the official website.         
	Shah Rukh also felt Souravs two for 24 tilted the scales in their favour against the Kings XI Punjab.         
	Against the Kings XI Punjab, he was amazing with those couple of wickets. When Dada came on and got those two early wickets it changed the match in our favour after that also he sort of kept them quiet and scared. I think that made a lot of difference, he said.         
	Its good for the team that it has started coming together. Our top-order whether its Ishant Sharma (in bowling) or Sourav, McCullum and Gayle (in batting), all are coming good together.         
	We did not play too hot on the first day. I think the first match would be considered as a practice match and we are working on the mistakes committed on Day I. The team is working together and thats what makes me feel a little more firm and good. But there is still a long way to go, he said.         
	Shah Rukh was diplomatic when asked who was a bigger hitter between Gayle and McCullum.         
	It is very difficult to say that. With Gayle we have a bet that he has to send one ball from South Africa to Calcutta and with McCullum we have that he has to send one back to New Zealand. Well find out who is going to win.

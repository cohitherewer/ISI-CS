The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ill get over it, says Federer
                                                   Ill get over it, says Federer
                                  
	New York: Losing his US Open title and 41-match winning streak was a huge blow, but Roger Federer says he will spend no time in brooding over it.         
	The player who is widely viewed as the greatest player of all time was clearly in low spirits at the end of the match, but he said he had more reasons to be happy than sad.         
	This one I think is easy to get over just because Ive had the most amazing summer, he said. I tried everything, you know. Didnt work. I missed chances. He played well and in the end it was a tough fifth set. Its acceptable. But life goes on. No problem.         
	Federers comments reflected his magnificent run through the summer, during which he finally completed his career Grand Slam at the French Open and then took the all-time lead in Grand Slam titles to 15 with his win at Wimbledon. More joy came in late July when Federer and wife Mirka celebrated the start of a family with the birth of twin girls.         
	Unbelievable. Unbelievable run. Being in all major finals and winning two of those, and losing the other two in five sets.         
	Thats the way it goes sometimes. But the year has been amazing already and its not over yet. Got married and had kids, dont know how much more I want.         
	But he did admit that he had finished the tournament and the years last Grand Slam in dire need of a good rest.                   
	Im tired. Sometimes they (Majors) hit you more than other ones, he said.         
	Next up, he said, would be a long rest period followed by getting prepared for the Masters events in Madrid and Paris followed by the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals which will be held for the first time at London in November.         
	Next year, I have sort of a plan in place obviously, he added.         
	I only look more or less to Australia, and after that, I dont know.         
	During the match, leading by 5-4 in the third set, Federer became testy with the chair umpire Jake Garner during the changeover. Federer, a hothead in his youth, has long been a remarkably well-mannered champion, but he used an expletive after snapping: Dont tell me to be quiet, OK? When I want to talk, I talk.         
	Federer later said the incident had not been a distraction. (Agencies)

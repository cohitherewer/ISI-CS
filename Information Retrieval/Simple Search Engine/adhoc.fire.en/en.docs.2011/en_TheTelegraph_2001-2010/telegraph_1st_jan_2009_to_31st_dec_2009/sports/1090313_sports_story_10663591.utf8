The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SA likely host for Trophy
                                                   SA likely host for Trophy
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The chief executives committee (CEC) of the International Cricket Council (ICC) recommended on Wednesday that South Africa should host this years Champions Trophy, ruling out Sri Lanka due to possible rain interruptions in September-October.         
	Pakistan was originally due to host the one-day International tournament last year but after several teams voiced security concerns about playing there, the ICC reacted by postponing the event before switching venues to Sri Lanka last month.         
	The ICC panel also recommended dates for next years World Twenty20 in the West Indies, now planned from April 30-May 16.         
	The CEC recommendations will go before its executive board for a final decision on Monday, the ruling body said in a statement on Wednesday.         
	South Africa is set to be confirmed as the venue for the eight-team tournament scheduled from September 24-October 5 if certain financial terms are agreed, the release said.         
	Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) could not guarantee clear weather in Colombo during the period.         
	The board of Cricket South Africa (CSA) will consider hosting the tournament once it receives an official invitation to do so which is expected from the ICCs executive board next week.

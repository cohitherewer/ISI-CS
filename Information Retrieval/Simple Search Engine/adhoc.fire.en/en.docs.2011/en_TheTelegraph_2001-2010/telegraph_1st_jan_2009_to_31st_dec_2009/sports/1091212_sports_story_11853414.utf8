The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Our players regrouped well: Kumar
                                                                                                                       7                                      Our players regrouped well: Kumar
                      
	Mohali: Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara hinted Friday that they would go into the second Twenty20 International against India with the same team which did brilliantly in the last game in Nagpur.         
	I am tempted to play the same eleven which did a brilliant job in the last game. But we will take into account the conditions here before finalising the playing eleven for the match, Sangakkara said at the pre-match press conference.         
	The Lanka captain lavished praise on his team members for the way they came back following the Test drubbing.         
	The way the players regrouped was very impressive. The kind of enthusiasm they have shown is great. I always say that Twenty20 cricket should be enjoyed, win or lose. It is with this attitude that we take the field, he said.         
	Sangakkara conceded that it was more difficult to start afresh in Twenty20 games.         
	It is more difficult to start afresh in T20 games. We will try to take the momentum into the next game. The bowlers come at you with a different plan. The batters also have a different plan to counter the bowlers. It is a question of coming up with new ideas... Keep thinking and adjusting, said the visiting captain.         
	We always have to come up with new ways to improve. Momentum is good as it gives us the confidence and self-belief. It gives us the belief that we can repeat all the good things, Sangakkara said.         
	Asked why the Indian team was not performing consistently in Twenty20s, Sangakkara said: It is for the Indian team to answer that. I can speak about my team only. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kings XI Punjab need some luck
                                                   Kings XI Punjab need some luck
                      
	Durban: The Kings XI Punjab will hope for better luck after facing the rain Gods ire twice, while Royal Challengers Bangalore will strive to get into the groove when the two teams cross swords in an IPL match here Friday.         
	Things are not really falling in place for the Punjab team, who are languishing at the bottom of the table after losing their first two encounters by the Duckworth-Lewis method.         
	Although they are yet to open their account, the Kings XI undoubtedly possess a mighty batting order, led by Yuvraj. The Royal Challengers bowling, consisting South African pacer Dale Steyn and New Zealand all-rounder Jesse Ryder will surely have their task cut out.         
	On the other hand, The Royal Challengers started their journey in style by comprehensively beating defending champions but since then, have been suffering from lack of consistency.         
	Captain Kevin Pietersen will surely draw from his experience to recapture the form they showed in the first match. Apart from Pietersen, the onus of building the innings will be on South Africa all-rounder Jacques Kallis and Rahul Dravid.

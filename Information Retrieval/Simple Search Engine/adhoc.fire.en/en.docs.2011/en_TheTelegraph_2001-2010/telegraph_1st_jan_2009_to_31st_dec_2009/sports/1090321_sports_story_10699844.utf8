The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United mettle to be tested
                                                   United mettle to be tested
                      
	London: After last weekends 4-1 hammering by Liverpool, Manchester Uniteds performance at Fulham on Saturday is certain to be closely examined for clues as to the state of the champions psyche. But if an element of self-doubt has contaminated the Old Trafford dressing room, Cristiano Ronaldo appears to have escaped infection.         
	The Portuguese winger remains convinced that United, who head to Fulham with a four-point advantage and a game in hand over Chelsea and Liverpool, can hold off their rivals in the title race as well as going on to lift the FA Cup and the Champions League trophy. Were positive about all the competitions were involved in and we want to win them all, Ronaldo said. It would be great to achieve that. Last season we won the league and the European Cup, and this year we have the opportunity to do even better. Well continue working hard and we believe we can do this.         
	Alex Ferguson shrugged off Sundays mauling just one of those days but it would be a major surprise if he did not shake things up for the trip to Fulham, who were comfortably beaten 4-0 during the FA Cup tie last month.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Were rusty: Raghu
                                                   Were rusty: Raghu
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal coach Raghu Nandy was candid enough to admit that his side were not up to the mark in their 1-1 draw against Tamil Nadu in the Santosh Trophy quarter final group match at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Chennai on Tuesday.         
	Frankly speaking we were rusty and did not play to our potential. We were lucky to come out with a point, Nandy said from Chennai.         
	Nandy attributed Bengals dismal performance on the day to a lack of match practice. Most of them havent played a competitive match for over a month and a half. You cant expect them to go full throttle on the very first day, he said.         
	Nandy said his team failed to make their man advantage count. Tamil Nadu played with ten men for 70 minutes. N. Mohanraj got the marching orders in the 20th minute for picking up two yellows.         
	Nandy, however, was optimistic about putting up a good show in the next two matches. Bengal play Manipur on Thursday and have their task cut out against the fast-paced team. We can only improve from here. Luckily Punjab too lost today and so we have a chance, Nandy said.         
	According to Nandy, Tamil Nadu made full use of their home advantage. They are playing in these energy-sapping conditions since the cluster matches and have settled down well. Whereas it was out first match, he said.         
	Bengals P.C. Lalampuiya, who equalised for his team in the 93rd minute, was happy to get his name on the scoresheet. Great that I am back among goals. Hopefully I will get a few in this tournament. I desperately want to regain my confidence in front of the goal, Chirag Uniteds new signing said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kohli, Saha too hot for SA
                                                     Kohli, Saha too hot for SA
            A STAFF REPORTER                    Virat Kohli(top) and Wriddhiman Saha                      
	Calcutta: Virat Kohli and Wriddhiman Saha scored the bulk of the runs as India defeated South Africa by 17 runs to win the Emerging Players Tournament in Brisbane Saturday.         
	Put in to bat, India scored 283 for nine in their allotted 50 overs. Kohli led the charge with a 102-ball 104 and wicket-keeper Wriddhiman scored 74 off 59 balls.         
	The South Africans, in the final with an all-win record, were then bowled out for 266 in 46.2 overs with Sudeep Tyagi returning figures of four for 72.         
	Indias start was not an ideal one. Tall South African pacer Lonwabe Tsotsobe, who returned figures of five for 69, dealt twin blows in the very first over of the match. He first trapped in-form Ajinkya Rahane in front of the wicket soon after the opener smacked the left-armer for a six over extra cover. Off the next ball, Tsotsobe had Murali Vijay lbw for a duck with a full-length delivery. That left India struggling at seven for two.         
	Thereafter, Kohli, the other opener, and captain Subramaniam Badrinath, did a bit of repairing job with a 49-run partnership for the third wicket before three quick dismissals saw India tottering at 109 for five by the 22nd over.         
	Then came Wriddhiman, who added 78 for the sixth wicket with Kohli to get the Indian innings back on track. Kohli was particularly prolific on the leg side, hitting sixes in consecutive overs with superb feet movement. He brought up his century in 97 balls before giving a straight forward catch to Beharsien at extra cover.         
	Useful contributions from leg-spinner Amit Mishra (25 off 22 balls) and Abhishek Nayar (23) down the order ensured a 280-plus score for India.         
	In reply, the South African openers made a steady start to their run chase, putting on 52 for the first wicket. However, the Indian bowlers brought their side back into the game, picking up wickets at regular intervals. Opener Rilee Rossouw slammed 35 from just 16 balls, including consecutive sixes off Tyagi, before the lanky right-arm pacer cleaned him up.         
	Kohli finished the tourmanment as the highest scorer, with 398 runs from seven matches with two centuries and as many half-centuries, while Tyagi was the highest wicket taker with 14 scalps from six matches.

                                                     Couldnt make Sachin play bridge: Mehta
            A STAFF REPORTER            Anand Mehta at the Khudiram Anushilan Kendra on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: He hasnt been able to inculcate his passion for bridge into his son-in-law, but is hoping his grand children would develop an interest.         
	Anand Mehta, Sachin Tendulkars father-in-law, is in the city to take part in the Golden Jubilee Bridge Championship at Khudiram Anushilan Kendra. Mehta is a five-time national champion.         
	Sachin doesnt play bridge he isnt even interested in learning the game. We usually do not have any interaction on bridge, Mehta said. I couldnt make him play bridge, but may be my grand children will be interested in the game.         
	Mehta also mentioned his ignorance about cricket in the same breath: I dont know much of cricket and watch matches occasionally. I havent been to the cricket ground too often.         
	Mehta, whose association with bridge goes back to his London School of Economics days, said he was proud to have Sachin as his son-in-law and described the great cricketer as a wonderful father and husband.

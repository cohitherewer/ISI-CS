The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ishants four-wkt haul in vain
                                                   Ishants four-wkt haul in vain
                      
	London: Ishant Sharmas four-wicket haul notwithstanding, New Zealand rode on cameos from Ross Taylor (41) and Brendon McCullum (31) to post 170 for seven against India in their warm-up match of the ICC World Twenty20 at Lords Monday.               
	India lost the first warm-up match by nine runs. Suresh Raina was the top scorer with a 24-ball 45               
	New Zealand overcame a shoddy start and some hostile bowling from Ishant before reaching a modest total with Taylor, McCullum, Scott Styris (29) and James Franklin (27 not out off 10 balls) shining with the bat.         
	Despite McCullum and Jesse Ryder (2), arguably two of the most hard-hitting batsmen in contemporary cricket, opening the innings, New Zealand had a rather subdued start after India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni put them in.         
	Ryders poor form in the recent Indian Premier League continued here too, and the left-hander had his off-stump uprooted by Ishant Sharma in the third over.         
	At the other end, McCullum often stepped out, trying to unsettle the disciplined Indian bowlers, and had occasional success against Praveen Kumar, RP Singh and Ishant too.         
	But just when he started looking dangerous, McCullum miscued a skier to become his Knight Riders teammate Ishants second victim.         
	Taylor struggled initially before hitting Pragyan Ojha for back-to-back sixes to light up proceedings but the big-turning left-arm spinner finally achieved some success when he had Martin Guptill (10) stumped in the same over.         
	Taylor had his share of luck as well and the right-hander got a reprieve when Dhoni dropped a thick edge off Harbhajan Singh.         
	Ishant returned to remove Jacob Oram (5), but Taylor found an able ally in Styris and the duo nosed ahead till the 16th over when Harbhajan removed Taylor with R P Singh taking a well-judged catch in the deep.         
	Taylors 33-ball knock included two sixes apart from three boundaries. Ishant was not done yet and the pacer castled Styris in his final over to finish with a figure of 4-0-25-4.         
	Down the order, James Franklin (27 not out off 10 balls) hit RP Singh for two successive sixes, followed by a four, to push the score.         
	Meanwhile, with London set to record the hottest Monday of England at 27 degree Centigrade (80.6F) and the entire country basking in second successive week of wall-to-wall perfect sunshine, Dhonis liability has turned into unimaginable riches.         
	Dhonis team was saddled with a number of part-time spinners who were expected to wilt under coolish, seamer-friendly English conditions. Instead, they all now appear a pack of aces under the brutish English sun. The team was certain to sweat on their fifth, if not the fourth bowler.         
	However, the heat of last two months  with the month of May the hottest in last decade  have ensured that the wickets would be dry and scruffy and suitable for slow bowlers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahindra are favourites
                                                   Mahindra are favourites
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mahindra United start favourites against Vasco in the I-League here Sunday.         
	Derrick Pereiras men have been struggling with their finishing and they will hope that the match against Vasco would be the right opportunity to rediscover their touch.         
	Vasco go in with hardly any confidence as, apart from being more or less confirmed for the second division next year, they have been a punching bag for every opposition.

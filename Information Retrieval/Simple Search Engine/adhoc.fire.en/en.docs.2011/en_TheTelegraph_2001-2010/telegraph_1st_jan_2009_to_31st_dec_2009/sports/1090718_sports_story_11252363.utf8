                                                   Manish Jain in semis
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Top-seeded Manish Jain defeated Aamer Hussain 3-1 in the quarter finals of the State Snooker Championship at the Bengal Rowing Club on Friday.         
	Aamers hopes of stretching this match also to the decider like all his previous ones couldnt stand up against some steady potting by Manish.         
	Manish will face Akram Khan in the semis, who edged out Gurjit Singh 3-2 in the quarters final.

                                                   Seniors the key: Younis
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan captain Younis Khan is banking heavily on the experienced duo of Shoaib Akhtar and Shahid Afridi to fire in the coming series against Australia in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.         
	Younis said he was happy to see injury-prone Shoaib back in the side for the five one-day Internationals and Twenty20 game.         
	He has worked hard and I am confident he will play out the full series. His return is a good sign for us as he is a very experienced performer, Younis said on Wednesday.         
	The senior batsman pointed out that both Shoaib and Afridi had this habit of performing well against top oppositions.         
	I am banking a lot on them, although we require a complete team effort to beat the Australians, he added.

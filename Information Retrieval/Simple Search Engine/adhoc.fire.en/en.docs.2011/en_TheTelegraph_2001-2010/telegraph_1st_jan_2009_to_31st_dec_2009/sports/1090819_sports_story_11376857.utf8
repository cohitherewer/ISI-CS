                                                   No. 3 is a very good number: Nadal
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Rafael Nadal is taking his demotion to world No. 3 in his stride and focusing on the long-term as he continues his comeback from injury at the Cincinnati Masters this week.         
	Its only a number, Nadal said Monday.         
	I hope to be ready in the future to come back to No. 2 or to be in the top position. No 3 is a very good number, too, he added with a smile.         
	The 23-year-old Spaniard, forced out of Wimbledon by his aching knees, returned last week in Montreal after an absence of more than two months.         
	His run to the quarter finals wasnt enough to stop eventual champion Andy Murray from seizing the world No. 2 spot behind Switzerlands Roger Federer.         
	Nadal said he wouldnt let the rankings  or anything else  lure him into pressing too hard, too soon, as he battles to come back and salvage the remainder of his season.         
	I need to go slow, no? Nadal said, even if that means he wont be at his best for the US Open that starts in a fortnight.         
	Sure, the US Open is very important, Nadal said. But after the US Open remains a lot of the season, and I would like to be ready to play a good end of the season.         
	For this week, at least, Nadal still has the No. 2 seed behind Federer, with defending champion Murray seeded third in the same half of the draw as Federer.         
	The top eight all enjoy first-round byes, and ninth-seeded Frenchman Gilles Simon was the highest seed in action, posting a 6-3, 6-2 victory over American Wayne Odesnik.         
	Federer, who claimed his record 15th Grand Slam title with a five-set victory over Andy Roddick in the Wimbledon final, has taken time away since as he and wife, Mirka, welcomed the arrival of twin daughters.         
	He, too, lost in the quarters in Montreal.         
	Federer said it was good to have Nadal back in the frame in time for the final Grand Slam of the year at Flushing Meadows later this month.         
	Andy (Murray) and myself have both benefited from Rafa being injured, Federer said. We both took advantage of it.         
	Now, hes back, Im back playing again after a few weeks. Everybody seems healthy again, and that can only be a good thing for the rest of the season.

  - Chris Gayle smashes century off 70 balls               Chris Gayle                      
	Chris GaylePerth: West Indian spinner Sulieman Benn faces a one-Test suspension following an altercation with the Australian duo of Brad Haddin and Mitchell Johnson on the second day of the ongoing third Test Thursday.         
	While Benn has been charged with a Level 2 offence for bringing the game into disrepute, Haddin and Johnson also face Level 1 charges, which may cost them half of their match fees, according to a report.         
	If guilty, Benn would either invite a one Test ban or lose 50-100 per cent of his match fee.         
	All hell broke loose in the eventful 118th over of the Australian innings and sparks flew first when Benn barged into non-striker Johnson, pursuing a single, to field off his own bowling.         
	Even though neither party looked at fault , Haddin was furious and he made it evident by pointing his bat at the towering 6 feet 7 inches tall West Indian.         
	Two balls later, they were at it again with Benn collecting Haddins drive and shaping to throw it at the strikers end even though there was no possibility of a run out.         
	As Haddin and Johnson met mid-pitch, Benn kept remonstrating and pointing at Haddin.         
	Johnson tried to position himself between Benn and Haddin when there was some physical contact and Johnson eventually was seen pushing Benn.         
	This was on a day when Chris Gayle whipped up the fifth fastest century, in terms of balls faced, in Test history as the West Indies refused to be blown over at the WACA.         
	Gayle unleashed the controlled fury of a captain who had watched his bowlers struggle for penetration with a 70-ball hundred that catapulted his side to 214 for two, a promising collection which still leaves them 306 behind.

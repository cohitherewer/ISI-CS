	Calcutta: The IFA governing body meeting on Wednesday ratified the proposal to merge the Premier and Super Division leagues.         
	However, the first division A and B groups will be merged only in 2010. In another decision, the proposed IFA U-16 academy will start off from March 30 at Haldia.         
	Former East Bengal striker Monojit Das will be the coach. Everton coach Tony Farrrell will do the screening.         
	IFAs U-14 academy at Ashoknagar will begin next month. The chief coach is yet to be decided.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | West Brom relegated
                                                   West Brom relegated
                      
	London: West Bromwich Albion were relegated from the Premier League after just one season when they lost 0-2 to Liverpool on Sunday.         
	Goals from Steven Gerrard and Dirk Kuyt sealed West Broms fate after a recent revival in their form suggested they could launch a second great escape after famously avoiding relegation in 2005.         
	Liverpool stayed in second place, behind champions Manchester United, moving on to 83 points  three ahead of Chelsea who beat Blackburn Rovers 2-0 at Stamford Bridge in the days other match.         
	A fourth minute header from Florent Malouda and a 58th minute strike from Nicolas Anelka gave Chelsea victory in interim manager Guus Hiddinks last match in charge at Stamford Bridge.         
	It was Anelkas 18th league goal of the season, putting him level at the top of the scoring chart with Cristiano Ronaldo of United.         
	The main talking point of the day was whether West Brom could upset Liverpool and keep alive their improbable hopes of staying up. Those chances receded after 28 minutes when Englands Footballer of the Year Gerrard pounced on a mistake by centre-back Shelton Martis.         
	He failed to control a soft pass from a teammate and Gerrard was first to the loose ball, powering forward and firing past Albion goalkeeper Dean Kiely. It was his 24th goal of the season in all competitions, extending his personal record. Kuyt added the second in the 63rd when he flew past Jonas Olsson and shot low into the net. A number of fans displayed banners pleading with Hiddink to stay as manager.

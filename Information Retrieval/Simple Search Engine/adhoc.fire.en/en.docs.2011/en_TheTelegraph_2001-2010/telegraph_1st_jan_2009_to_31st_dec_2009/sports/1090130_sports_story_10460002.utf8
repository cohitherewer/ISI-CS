The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Massive win for Zimbabwe
                                                   Massive win for Zimbabwe
                      
	Mombasa: Zimbabwe recorded their fifth largest one-day victory after posting their highest ever total Thursday, beating Kenya by 151 runs to lead 2-0 in the five-match series.         
	Stuart Matsikenyeri hit 90 off 95 balls and Malcolm Waller 63 off 54, but it was Elton Chigumburas 68 off 29 balls that propelled Zimbabwe to score 105 in the last eight overs and reach 351 for seven to surpass their mark of 340/2 against Namibia in 2003 in Harare.         
	After losing a wicket in the first over, Kenya never approached the average 7 runs per over they needed to score to win.           (AP)

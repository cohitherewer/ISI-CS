            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Defending champions Australia were upset by New Zealand in a crucial match of the ICC Womens World Cup 2009 at the picturesque North Sydney Oval on Sunday.         
	New Zealand, put into bat, was bowled out for 205 in 48. The Black Caps then fought back gallantly to restrict Australia to 132 for six before the match was abandoned due to bad light and light showers to win the match by 13 runs, according to the Duckworth-Lewis method.         
	In another match, at Newcastle, the West Indies scraped past South Africa by two wickets. Seventeen-year-old Stafanie Taylor took four for 17 to restrict South Africa 116 in 45.2 overs.         
	Sri Lanka face Pakistan in Canberra on Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Crucial RCTC meeting today
                                                                                                               Crucial RCTC meeting today 
            OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT      
	Calcutta: Sunday will see a bipartite meeting between top officials of the RCTC and representatives of the Karmachari Union there to resolve a dispute which is threatening the February 28 Derby.          
	Late on Saturday, the buzz was that Lt. Gen. (retd) J. R. Mukherjee, who quit as the CEO a few days ago, may attend the meeting as a special invitee.          
	If he does, that would lend credence to talk that there is a move to get him to reconsider his decision.          
	Gen. Mukherjee resigned after a club member had made an issue of being billed for the use of a mobile phone, which is only permitted after a payment of Rs 1,500 for each day of usage.          
	Racegoers are, of course, hoping that the RCTC functions smoothly so that the sport itself does not suffer.

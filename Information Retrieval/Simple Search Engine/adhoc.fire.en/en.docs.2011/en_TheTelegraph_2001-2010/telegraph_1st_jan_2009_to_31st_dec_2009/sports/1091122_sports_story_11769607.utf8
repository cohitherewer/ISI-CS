The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clarke: Id be happy to lead if Ponting quits
                                                                                                                       7                                      Clarke: Id be happy to lead if Ponting quits
                      
	Melbourne: A fit-again Michael Clarke, who recently returned to the Australian team as vice-captain, wants to lead the side in future but only if incumbent Ricky Ponting decides to walk away on his own.         
	Clarke, who missed the Champions Trophy earlier this year and Australias seven-match ODI tour to India due to a back injury, returned to the 12-member Aussie squad for the first Test against West Indies in Brisbane starting November 26.         
	The 28-year-old right-hander said at the moment he was happy to captain Australia in the Twenty20 format and would be more than delighted to get the job once Ponting calls it a day.         
	I could sit here and lie and say I dont think about it.         
	The truth is I hope I continue to get opportunities, whether it be one-day cricket, now with Twenty20 cricket or hopefully one day I get the chance to captain in Test cricket, Clarke was quoted as saying by an Australian daily.         
	But it is all so far away. Right now, I am over the moon and stoked I have been given the chance to captain the Twenty20. My leader, still, is Ricky Ponting.         
	He is a fantastic captain, a good friend and is someone I have always looked up to. I would love for him to continue to play as long as he wants. If theres an opportunity after Ricky, I would love that  no doubt, Clarke said.         
	But it is important the public and the media understand, I have absolutely no intention or desire to take over any captaincy without Punter walking away, he added.         
	Clarke, who was groomed for vice-captaincy for nearly two years, said Ponting has set very high standards and it would be difficult for him to match his present skippers exploits.         
	I have said to him for years I hope he retires the same day as me. If anything, this allows me to get even closer to Punter now that I have been given these leadership roles. Thats exciting for me.         
	I only wish I can be half as good as Punter. You have to perform on the field above all else, and his stats in all forms of the game are amazing. In our sport thats a huge part of leadership and respect, he said.           (PTI)

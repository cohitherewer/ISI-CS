The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United test for Sporting today
                                                   United test for Sporting today
                      
	Panaji: Sporting Clube de Goa will be keen to stay at the top of the table when they take on United Sports Club in the 17th round of the I-League at the Nehru Stadium, here on Friday.         
	The match is crucial to Sporting Clubes hopes of landing their first I-League title. The team, on 34 points, are ahead of Mohun Bagan by a point. Two successive wins under new coach Clifford Chukwuma and East Bengals victory over the green and maroon brigade in their last match have propelled Sporting Clube to the top spot which they had conceded to Karim Bencherifas team in the 15th round. Clube will be missing Elijah Junior who will sit out after picking up a red card in the last match. Freddy Mascarenhas will get a start on the morrow. United SC coach Subrata Bhattacharya said his priority is to avoid relegation. The win against JCT has put the teams confidence on a high and we are looking to stay above the relegation zone, said Bhattacharya.         
	Meanwhile, Churchill Brothers bounced back from a goal down to defeat JCT 2-1 in Ludhiana on Thursday. The win kept Churchills (33 points from 17 matches) title hopes alive .         
	JCT took the lead in the 14th minute through Jagpreet Singh.         
	Churchill Brothers got things on level terms when skipper Okolie Odafa found the net from a goalmouth melee in the 49th minute. The visitors found the winner in the dying minutes of the match when Ogba Kalu scored off a rebound.

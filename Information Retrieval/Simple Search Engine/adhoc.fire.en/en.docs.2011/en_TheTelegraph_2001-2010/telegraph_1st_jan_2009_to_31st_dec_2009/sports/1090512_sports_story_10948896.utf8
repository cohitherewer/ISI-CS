The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brendon mum on quitting
                                                     Brendon mum on quitting
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            McCullum                           
	Calcutta/Johannesburg: The Kolkata Knight Riders hopes of reaching the Indian Premier League (IPL) semi-finals lay in tatters but captain Brendon McCullum is mum on when he is going to quit captaincy.         
	The Knight Riders skipper had said after the humiliating loss against the Mumbai Indians on April 27 in Port Elizabeth that he would be prepared to step aside if the Knights fail to reach the last-four stage. The Telegraph had reported on April 28 that the New Zealander said some pretty strong messages were given in the dressing room after that loss, after which he was prepared to step down. But McCullum, who replaced Sourav Ganguly as the captain as per John Buchanans wish and has full support of principal owner Shah Rukh Khan, has fallen silent when its time to act.         
	At the moment, all that I am focusing on is the next few games. Im trying to do whatever I can to get something going, McCullum said, after his team slumped to a seven-wicket defeat against the Delhi DareDevils here Monday.         
	I know I mentioned that (stepping down) a couple of games ago and that is something that Ive got to look at. Ill work out the goal with the coaching staff next year. But whatever happens, Ill be totally committed to the Kolkata Knight Riders and will be helping to get some results which we can be immensely proud of, he said.         
	Looking back at the teams wretched run in the tournament, McCullum felt it was because of a combination of bad luck and poor execution.         
	A bit of both. When things are going for you, you get the luck. Things obviously arent going for us at the moment. And we are not getting the luck go our way, the New Zealand stumper remarked.         
	Asked to pinpoint reasons behind the teams spectacular slide, McCullum said: Its hard to put your finger (on any one thing). We have been inconsistent in all the games. When we bat well, our bowling and fielding lets us down. When we bowl well, our batting lets us down.

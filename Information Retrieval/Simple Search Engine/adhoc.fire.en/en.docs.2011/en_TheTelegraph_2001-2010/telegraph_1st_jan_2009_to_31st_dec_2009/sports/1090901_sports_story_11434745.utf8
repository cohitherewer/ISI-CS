                                                   PCB to skip meeting
                      
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has decided to skip the meeting of the 2011 World Cup central organising committee to be held in Mumbai on Wednesday.         
	A board official Monday said since Pakistan no longer holds any hosting right of the tournament after its out of court settlement with the International Cricket Council (ICC), it would be a futile effort to attend the meeting.         
	Initially it was decided that PCB chairman Ejaz Butt and senior officials Wasim Bari and Subhan Ahmed would attend the meeting.         
	The decision to attend the meeting was taken before the final settlement reached with the ICC. Since Pakistan no longer holds any hosting rights of the tournament, it would serve no purpose to attend the meeting, the official said.

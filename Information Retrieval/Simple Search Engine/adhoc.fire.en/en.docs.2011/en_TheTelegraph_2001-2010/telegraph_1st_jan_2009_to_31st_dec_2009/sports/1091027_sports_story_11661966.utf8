The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kapil lashes out at BCCI
                                                   Kapil lashes out at BCCI
                      
	Vadodara: World Cup winning captain Kapil Dev Monday came down heavily on the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for sacking Indias bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad and fielding coach Robin Singh without appreciating the good work they had done for the team.         
	Kapil said both Prasad and Robin were doing a good job for the team and if they were sacked for the poor performance of the team, then the manager should also been held responsible.         
	Both of them (Prasad and Robin) have done a good job for the team. The Board should have removed the manager of the team also, Kapil said here Monday.         
	The basis of removal from the post should be on performance. Why should there be a sword hanging over those who are giving good results? he asked.         
	He also said Australia were no doubt the better side in the first ODI. He added that India need to improve in every department of the game to win the series.

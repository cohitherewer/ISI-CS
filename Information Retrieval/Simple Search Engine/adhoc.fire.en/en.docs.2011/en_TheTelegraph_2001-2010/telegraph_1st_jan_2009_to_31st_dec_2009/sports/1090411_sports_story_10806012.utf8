                                                   Intikhab banks on spin vs Aussies
                      
	Islamabad: Australias vulnerability against spin in the ongoing series against South Africa has encouraged Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam ahead of this months one-day International series against the world champions.         
	What I saw yesterday (Thursday) on television, its a good sign for us because we do have three quality spinners, Alam told reporters. If the wickets assist spinners a little, we do have a good chance against Australia.         
	Pakistan has included experienced leg-spinner Shahid Afridi and off-spinners Saeed Ajmal and former captain Shoaib Malik in the squad for the five-match series against Australia, beginning from April 22 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.         
	We may go with an additional spinner, but it all depends how the wickets respond, Alam said. Pakistans squad gathered at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on Friday for a three-day training camp before flying to Dubai on Sunday.         
	We are going to play the practice game on the same wicket on which we play the series opener against Australia, Alam said. It will give us a fair idea about the conditions.         
	The Pakistan coach said dew at night might affect the teams fielding under floodlights. There was lot of dew during one of the matches which I saw there, Alam said.           (AP)

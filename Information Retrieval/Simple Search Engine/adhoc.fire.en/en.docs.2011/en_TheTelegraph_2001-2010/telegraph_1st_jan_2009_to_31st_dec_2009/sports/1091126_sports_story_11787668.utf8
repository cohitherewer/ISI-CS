	Calcutta: Manoj Tiwary is confident Bengal will be able to bat the remaining two days to snatch a point against Saurashtra. The visitors declared at 650 for nine.         
	It will be difficult to overhaul 650 But given the nature of the wicket, we can do that The pace of scoring will also be important, said the stand-in Bengal captain.         
	Saurashtra coach Debu Mitra, however, was keeping fingers crossed.         
	Anything can happen in cricket. Im not going to predict anything. The wicket is playing true. If we get a few wickets         
	Tiwary, too, echoed Mitra.         
	Theres hardly anything in the wicket We expected Saurashtra to score more than 500. Nothing much happened with the new ball and it was difficult to contain them to below 600.         
	Saurashtra captain Jaydev Shah didnt agree with the view that they should have declared a bit early. We declared at the right time We wanted to use the new ball Thursday morning. So, getting to bowl seven-eight overs in the last hour Wednesday was fine.         
	It would have been better had we managed one more wicket. Snatching the first innings lead will be most important.

                                                     Cant take any team lightly
  - Got to perform at 80-90 per cent of potential, otherwise it gets tough: Dhoni         A CORRESPONDENT            Team India captain Dhoni                                 
	Nottingham: Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni spoke to the media on Tuesday, the eve of their match against Ireland.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Can any team be taken lightly?         
	I think that if any team takes the other team lightly, especially in this format, it will be the biggest mistake. This is a very different format, and in every team you have two or three big hitters who can turn the game on their own or two or three bowlers, either spinners or fast bowlers. So I think there is no much difference between the teams in this format. All the teams are quite close and it all depends on how they perform on the day.         
	The match against Ireland         
	It will be very important to go out on the field and give off your best. It can be one of the games where people say it is not important but it is very crucial for the players because you want to get yourself going. If there are any areas that you need to work on, especially as a bowler, this can be the match where you can a bit relaxed, a bit more calm and composed. We will take it as just another game. So it is very important to be serious on the field.         
	The spinners role         
	The first conference that I had, I said that the spinners would make a big impact in this tournament. We have seen the quality of spinners that every side has and that is really amazing. In England, somehow the bowlers get some help. There could be a one-off venue where the spinners might not be as effective Still I feel all the world class spinners would prove to be too handy in this tournament and put pressure on the batsmen They will have a bigger impact in this tournament.         
	On the Ireland team         
	We know as much as you guys know. If anybody thinks any team is easy, then hes making the biggest mistake... In T20, you cant take any team lightly... Ireland will be confident and theres less pressure on them. They will come across and play aggressive cricket. They have nothing to lose because they have also qualified for the next stage. They will be more free, there will be less pressure on them so you can expect some good cricket on the field.         
	On Australia crashing out         
	It is sad they are out, but you have to play well and that is what T20 is all about.         
	On some of the players opting for rest         
	Well, as I said, we have plenty of optional sessions. You will not see all the 16 guys at practice... If the players think they need a bit of rest they opt for it. That is the good part because you know your body more than anyone else. It is a short tournament but at the same time it is very demanding. So it is a demanding format and hopefully we wont have injuries.         
	If he is wary of upsets         
	If you are supposed to lose just one game it should be Ireland because after this it will be a do or die situation. Hopefully, as I said, it is about playing good cricket on the field... What we are looking forward to is playing to our potential, and if you do that, there are less chances of the opposition winning.         
	The favourites         
	Well, if we play to potential we are a tough side to beat. I will stick to that because you have to be there throughout Youve got to perform at 80-90 per cent of potential, otherwise it gets tough... As a team, we dont look too far ahead and arent caught up in the past either... We live in the present.         
	Batting at No. 3         
	No special reasons.         
	Experiments against Ireland         
	I dont think we will experiment too much against Ireland. We will try to play with the strongest side available provided there are no injuries.

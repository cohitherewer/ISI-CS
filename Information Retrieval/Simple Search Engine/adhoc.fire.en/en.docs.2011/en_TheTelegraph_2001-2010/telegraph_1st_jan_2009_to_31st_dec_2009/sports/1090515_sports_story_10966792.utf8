	Madrid: Sania Mirza and her partner Chia-Jung Chuang of Chinese Taipei reached the womens doubles last four of the Madrid Open here after their opponents retired during the quarter-finals         
	The Indo-Chinese Taipei pair were leading 2-0 in the first set when Victoria Azarenka of Belarus and Elena Vesnina of Russia retired. They will take on Kveta Peschke of the Czech Republic and Lisa Raymond of the US in the last four.         
	Sania and Chuang had earlier upset second-seeded Spanish pair of Anabel Medina Garrigues and Virginia Ruano Pascual to enter the quarter finals of the $4,500,000 event. The Indo-Chinese Taipei pair had won 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 10-7.         
	Azarenka and Vesnina went past the Russian duo of Alla Kudryavtseva and Ekaterina Makarova 6-1, 6-1 in the second round.         
	Leander Paes and his Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy, seeded third, pulled out due to Dlouhys illness after getting a bye in the first round.         
	In mens singles, world No. 1 Rafael Nadal was handed a walkover into the quarter finals when his third-round opponent, Philipp Kohlschreiber, was forced out of the claycourt event with a left leg injury.         
	Nadal was joined in the last eight by world No. 2 Roger Federer, a 6-2, 6-4 winner over 14th seed James Blake, and Briton Andy Murray, who coped well with the blustery conditions in the Magic Box stadium to dispatch Spanish 16th seed Tommy Robredo 7-5, 6-1.         
	Serbias Novak Djokovic, chasing a fifth straight final appearance, also advanced with a routine 6-4, 6-4 victory over unseeded Italian Andreas Seppi.         
	Federer, who has yet to win a title this year, wrapped up victory with a fifth ace on his first match point and will play Andy Roddick in the next round.         
	The sixth-seeded American was also handed a walkover when his third-round opponent Nikolay Davydenko withdrew on Thursday with a left leg injury.           (AGENCIES)

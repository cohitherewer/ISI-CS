                                                   Elton stars in victory
                      
	Dhaka: An all-round display by Elton Chigumbura led Zimbabwe to a five-wicket victory over Bangladesh in Tuesdays opening one-day International.         
	The medium-pacer picked up three for 27 as Bangladesh were bowled out for 186 in 46.5 overs. Chigumbura then hammered an unbeaten 60 in 50 balls, with nine fours and one six, to guide Zimbabwe to a comfortable win with 15.2 overs to spare.         
	He and Stuart Matsikenyeri (47 not out) shared an unbroken sixth-wicket stand of 99. Left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak claimed three wickets in his first over as Zimbabwe wobbled at 39 for three. He eventually finished with three for 36.         
	The second game in the five-match series is also in Dhaka on Thursday. (Reuters)

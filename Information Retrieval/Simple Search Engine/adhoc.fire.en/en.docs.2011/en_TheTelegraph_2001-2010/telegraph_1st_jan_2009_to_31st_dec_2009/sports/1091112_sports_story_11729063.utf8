The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | EB to start afresh under De Ridder
                                                                                                                                     EB to start afresh under De Ridder
    - I-League. Dont expect miracles overnight, says coach             A STAFF REPORTER            Yusif Yakubu, Syed Rahim Nabi and Bhaichung Bhutia during a practice session at the East Bengal ground on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: East Bengal play hosts to Lajong FC in an ONGC I-League encounter at the Barasat Stadium on Thursday with only one thing in the mind. And thats fight and fight it the hard way. Buoyed by consecutive wins after the disastrous 3-5 loss to Mohun Bagan, East Bengal will leave nothing to chance to make it three-in-a-row.         
	Thursdays clash will also be coach Phillippe de Ridders first match on the East Bengal bench. By his own admission he is yet to grasp the nitty-gritties of the team he is in charge of and once again harped on how difficult it is for a coach to take charge of a squad in the mid-season. But he has promised to give something special in four to five weeks and has urged the fans to refrain from criticising the players till then.         
	I have just come and is trying to get a fair idea about the team. Dont expect a dramatic change or some miracle overnight. But in a month or so this team will be a different proposition altogether. That much I can say. On Thursday I can promise one thing though. Our boys will fight and fight it the hard way, the flamboyant Belgian said after a practice session on Wednesday.         
	De Ridder said he is yet to take a call on Bhaichung Bhutia, who missed the last two matches due to calf muscle and hamstring injuries. He is ok and looked good in the last two days. I will take a call on Thursday morning. He will play only if he is fully fit, he said. If Bhaichung returns then Subhas Singh is likely to sit out.         
	De Ridder is aware how dangerous Lajong can be on their day. I saw a couple of matches and I am very impressed. They have some very good players. But we wont take things lying down, he said.         
	The coach however refused to divulge anything about the composition of his team. The practice session though hinted that Mehrajuddin Wadoo may play as a central defender while Mehtab Hossain returns after a one-match suspension and Beokhokhei Singh may make way for him.         
	Lajong, meanwhile, are in without their skipper Aiborlang Khongjee who has a double booking. But coach Stanely Rozario was hardly worried on Wednesday. These things happen. We are in good form and hope to continue with that, he said. Lajong come from a well earned 1-1 draw against Pune FC and Rozario hoped that they would get at least a point on Thursday.         
	According to Rozario the Durand Cup win over East Bengal doesnt have any significance in the present context. A lot of things have changed since then. And he is right. In the last two matches East Bengal didnt look as hopeless as they were during the Durand Cup.

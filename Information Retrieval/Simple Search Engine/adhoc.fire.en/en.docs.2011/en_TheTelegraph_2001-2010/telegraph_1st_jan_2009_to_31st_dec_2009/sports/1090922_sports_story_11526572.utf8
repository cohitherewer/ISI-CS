The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A TIME FOR CHAMPIONS
                                                   A TIME FOR CHAMPIONS
      With the 50-over format increasingly threatened by Twenty20, the Champions Trophy, the last major one-day tournament before the 2011 quadrennial showpiece, might just show that all hopes not lost yet. The Telegraph takes a look at the eight teams                       
	GROUP A            
	AUSTRALIA  
	Ricky Pontings men would be determined to prove that the Ashes debacle was a mere blip. After thrashing England 6-1 in the one-day series, Australia will now be aiming to reclaim the No.1 spot by successfully defending the Trophy. The team are back to winning ways and the youngsters have fitted into the scheme of things rather well. In wicketkeeper Tim Paine and Shane Watson, Australia seem to have found a new and settled opening combination. The lusty hitting of Cameron White and James Hopes have more or less made up for the absence of Andrew Symonds and that gives some hope to the middle-order. Not to mention Ponting and the rejuvenated Brett Lee. If Lee has regained his express pace, Nathan Brackens accuracy could spell trouble for the opposition. If that werent enough, Mike Husseys presence would add stability when the going gets tough. Ponting is already pinning hopes on the youngsters. Time to take note!  
	INDIA            
	Indias awesome record in ODIs is reflected in the rankings, where they currently sit at No.2. But it remains to be seen whether they can replicate that form and consistency in the Champions Trophy. The tri-series win in Colombo has boosted their confidence after the World Twenty20 failure apart from helping the players gain match fitness after a long break. Mahendra Singh Dhonis men have been placed in a tough group alongside Australia and Pakistan and Ricky Pontings men have underlined their supremacy in no uncertain terms against England and that isnt good news. The clash with Pakistan has already been dubbed match of the tournament. The return of Gautam Gambhir and the presence of Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid will lend solidity to the batting, but it is the bowling and fielding, as Dhoni admitted, that will decide Indias fortunes in the tournament. One only hopes Ashish Nehra, RP Singh and Ishant Sharma step up in Zaheers absence.  
	PAKISTAN            
	Never write off Pakistan. If theres one lesson the world has learnt from Pakistans success in the World Twenty20, it is this. Despite the recent reversals against Sri Lanka, Younis Khans men are determined to showcase their talent in the 50-over format. More importantly, the team want to do it for the late Bob Woolmer. Ill go to Bobs home (in South Africa) and celebrate the Champions Trophy win with his family, Younis said. Pakistan, who have never won this tournament, have a well-balanced side what with the comeback of former ICL rebels Mohammed Yousuf and Naved-ul Hasan. They open against the West Indies but the outcome of their match against India could decide their momentum in the tournament. Pakistan had lost to India after scoring 273 in the 2003 World Cup in South Africa and Younis admitted recently that the loss still hurt. So this time Pakistan would be looking to put the record straight.  
	WEST INDIES            
	There should be no second thoughts as to the weakest side in the tournament. With no end in sight to the dispute between the West Indian Cricket Board and its players over pay, the Caribbean nations will be without the swashbuckling Chris Gayle, Shivnarine Chanderpaul or Fidel Edwards. They will be led by Floyd Reifer, captain in the home drubbing at the hands of Bangladesh. The fitness doubts over pacer Kemar Roach will only add to their problems and a tough group further complicates matters. The ICC has already announced that the team will be given time until the last possible moment to make changes to their squad but how much of an advantage that will be is unclear. Given the breathing space, it remains to be seen whether the warring parties are able to come to a rapprochement before their first match. Fast bowler Kevin McClean and off-spinner Royston Crandon have no international experience, but that doesnt really say much. We can only expect further lows!  
	GROUP B  
	SOUTH AFRICA            
	The No.1 team in ODIs will also have to contend with the pressure of playing at home and how they deal with it will determine whether Graeme Smiths men can flourish in the meet. It is difficult to find a weak link in their line-up. As Ian Chappell put it: South Africa hardly have any weaknesses. The experience of Smith, Herschelle Gibbs and Jacques Kallis is complemented by the exciting AB de Villiers and JP Duminy. In Albie Morkel they have an all-rounder who can upset all calculations while Dale Steyn and Wayne Parnell are capable of running through any side. Their spin options feature the steady Johan Botha and the immensely talented left-armer Roelof van der Merwe. If they can overcome the chokers tag, there will be no stopping them. Unlike others, the Proteas have enjoyed a period of rest and that should have allowed the players to recharge their cells. Moreover, after missing out on the nominations for the ICC awards, the hosts will be more than keen to prove themselves.  
	NEW ZEALAND            
	One-day cricket has traditionally been their strong point and the Black Caps will go into the tournament as the dark horses. Its another thing that New Zealand have failed to convert their potential into results in the recent past but Daniel Vettrois men are capable of upsetting any side on their day. In Brendon McCullum and Jesse Ryder they have hard hitters at the top followed by the classy Ross Taylor and Jacob Oram. Vettori has already stressed on the importance of partnerships and the batsmen need to click to erase the memories of Sri Lanka. Shane Bond and Daryl Tuffey are back in the thick of things after spending time in the wilderness during their ICL stint. Vettori will be hoping for a return of the Bond magic on the hard South African wickets. New Zealand,however, have proved to be incosistent in the warm-up matches, losing to South African domestic side Warriors but coming back strongly against India.  
	SRI LANKA            
	They might not count among the favourites, but Kumar Sangakkaras men have the ability to upset calculations any day. Some of their star campaigners are ageing, but players like Angelo Mathews and Tillekaratne Dilshan can inspire confidence with their powerful hitting, disciplined bowling and sensational fielding. Not to mention Sanath Jayasuriya, Mahela Jayawardene and Muttiah Muralidharan whose experience can come in handy in pressure situations. It works in our favour not to be considered favourites because there will not be too much attention given to us... Playing on such a great stage automatically means teams would be out to show and highlight what they can do, and it will be all about handling the pressure, Sangakkara summed up the mood in the camp. The captain is pinning hopes on Murali and Ajantha Mendis, but it remains to be seen how much they would be successful in South African wickets.  
	ENGLAND            
	England are in need of a redemption of their one-day fortunes after the 1-6 humiliation suffered at the hands of Australia in their own backyard. It is bound to be a struggle for Andrew Strausss men in the absence of key players, Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen. Constant chopping and changing coupled with these injury absences have not helped their cause and it will take them some effort to convince every one of their capabilities. To put it bluntly, England do not have a match-winner in their ranks.As Strauss said, the loss to Australia will serve as a reminder that as a side were nowhere near where we want to be. Unless a Graeme Swann or an Adil Rashid produces something out of the ordinary it will be impossible for them to progress from a tough group. Strauss is hoping Ravi Bopara rediscovers the form he showed against the West Indies at the start of the English summer and Paul Collingwood shows some consistency to bring back the smile on the fans faces.

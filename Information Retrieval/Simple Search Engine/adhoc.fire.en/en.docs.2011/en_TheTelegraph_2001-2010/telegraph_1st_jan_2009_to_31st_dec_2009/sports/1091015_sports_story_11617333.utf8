	Hyderabad: IPL champions Deccan Chargers crashed out of the Champions League after suffering a three-run defeat against Trinidad and Tobago in their do-or-die Group A match here Wednesday.         
	The see-saw match witnessed pulsating action till the last ball. Chasing 150 to win, the hosts could manage just 146 for nine in their stipulated 20 overs.         
	The Chargers required eight runs off the last over, but they had no recognised batsman at the crease, and the tail-enders could score only four runs.         
	The victory of the Caribbean side also cleared the entry of the Somerset Sabres into the Super Eight from Group A.         
	The Chargers had lost their first match to the Sabres.         
	Captain Adam Glichrist, Y. Venugopal Rao, and Rohit Sharma batted well for short periods of time, but that proved insufficient to pull their side through.         
	Opting to field, hosts did well to restrict Trinidad and Tobago to 149 for seven. William Perkins top-scored for the Carbbean side with his 38 (off 32 balls) at the top, and Kieron Pollard played a blazing 31 off 14 balls down the order.         
	Pollard unleashed some lusty shots towards the end of the innings to lift his side to a competitive total, hitting four sixes.         
	Fidel Edwards, who was barred from bowling in the last match for firing two beamers, made amends by taking three wickets for the Chargers. Dwayne Bravo (3/24) was the most successful bowler for Trinidad amp; Tobago, who entered the next stage with a clean slate.         
	With qualification in mind, Gilchrist began on an explosive note, smashing a six over third man off Ravi Rampaul in the first legal ball of the innings.         
	Laxman, too, was fantastic when he guided the first ball from Dwayne Bravo for a delicate boundary on the leg side as the hosts were off to a flier.         
	Dwayne struck twice to reverse the script. He first trapped Laxman in front of the wicket, and then got rid of Abhinav Kumar, by getting him caught at the wicket. Then Andrew Symonds became the third batsman had to leave after a terrible mix up with Glichrist.         
	Rohit, the next man in, smashed two boundaries off Sherwin Ganga. Glichrist continued his awesome batting. The duo added 55 runs for the fourth wicket to bring the Chargers back in the match. The hosts were in the drivers seat at that time. But both Gilchrist and Rohit departed in a gap of three balls, with the team reeling at 86/5, and the Chargers could not recover after those blows.

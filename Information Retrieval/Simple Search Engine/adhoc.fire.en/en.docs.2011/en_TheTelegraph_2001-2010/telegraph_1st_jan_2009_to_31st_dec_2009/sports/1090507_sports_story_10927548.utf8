The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Officials divided 
                                                   Officials divided 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Indian sports administrators seem a divided lot on the eve of what could easily be the bitterest election in the history of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).         
	Fridays election, to be held at the AFC headquarters, is set to be a ruthless political fight between AFC president Mohammed bin Hammam and Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al-Khalifa, a member of the Bahrain royal family, for a place in Fifas executive committee.         
	Back in Delhi, while the All-India Football Federation (AIFF) has made it clear that it would back Hammam for the Fifa post, there is clear indication that a section of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) officials are rooting for Salman.         
	The AIFF general secretary, Alberto Colaco, who left for Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday, along with the vice-president, A.R. Khaleel, told The Telegraph: The executive committee of the AIFF has decided to vote for Hammam. Thats all I can tell you.         
	IOA sources, however, said that a few officials are working with the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) to ensure a Salman victory. Hammam has already alleged that the Kuwait-based OCA was offering financial inducements in the form of grants to those federations who cast their vote for Salman.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karim, Subhas calm before the storm
                                                     Karim, Subhas calm before the storm
            A STAFF REPORTER                
	Calcutta: The last time Karim Bencharifa and Subhas Bhowmick sat on rival benches during a match, in an I-League clash last February, the Indian outfoxed his Moroccan counterpart to romp home 3-0.         
	But any reference to that match and Mohun Bagan coach wouldnt agree that any parallel could be drawn between them. It was different last time. Now, its just the beginning of the season. And, please dont highlight it as a grudge match for me as its nothing of the sort, he said.         
	He is also optimistic about his teams chances as he said: We need strong communication among the players tomorrow (Sunday). We have a fit side at present. The match may be won by some individual brilliance but our fitness and teamwork are our assets.         
	When reminded that Bhaichung Bhutia may miss the match, the Moroccan said: So what Its just like Barreto is a doubtful starter for us, so is Bhaichung for them.         
	Terming the match as a tough one the coach said: Its an important match and Im keeping a tab on the performance of the other teams. We have three points from three matches and a win on the morrow will take us closer to the top.         
	Bhowmick, on the other hand, chose to underplay Bhaichungs injury problem as he said: If he is not fit, I have other options in Abel Hammond and Subhas Singh. But as of now, Bhaichung is a doubtful starter because of a muscle pull.         
	According to him, the team which handles pressure well will triumph in the end. In a derby clash, it all depends on the orientation of the players nerves. No one starts as a favourite.         
	The battle Sunday, will be as much off the pitch as on it, as two shrewd brains try to dominate with their tactical moves. In that case, even a Bhaichung Bhutia starting the game shouldnt be a surprise!         
	Meanwhile, Ghanaian Yusif Yakubu reportedly lost cool after practice Saturday when some club officials asked him to submit photocopies of his passport and visa as they were instructed so by the Ghanaian embassy in India. However, peace was brokered later after two top club officials intervened.

                                                   Not joining IPL paid off: Broad 
                      
	London: England pacer Stuart Broad, who set the stage for Englands win in the fifth Ashes Test with his five-wicket haul, felt his decision to turn down a lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL) offer helped him to concentrate on the series.         
	Broad scalped five wickets, including that of skipper Ricky Ponting and Brad Haddin, for just 37 runs in Australias first innings at the Oval, helping the hosts win the series 2-1 and wrest the urn from the visitors.         
	The reason I didnt go was to focus on the Ashes and that really worked out for me. I managed to play in all the five Tests and make useful contributions So that decision was certainly worthwhile, Broad said.

	London: Liverpool overcame a determined challenge from once-mighty rivals Leeds United with a 1-0 win at Elland Road in the third round of the League Cup Tuesday while Arsenal teenagers put up a convincing show against West Bromwich Albion to win 2-0 at home.         
	Leeds, currently top of League One (division three) but Liverpools equals for decades until their relegation from the top flight five years ago, succumbed to a superbly executed 66th minute goal scored by 20-year-old French striker David Ngog who spun and side-footed past Leeds keeper Shane Higgs.         
	With nine changes made from the Liverpool team that beat West Ham United at the weekend, Benitez followed his League Cup policy and used the competition to play some of his fringe players.         
	In the early stages, however, few of them mounted a convincing case for greater responsibilities as Leeds set the tempo and created the most clear-cut opportunities.         
	The home side had the ball in the net after only 12 minutes as Liverpools frailty from set-pieces was again exposed by a well-directed corner by Robert Snodgrass that was eventually flicked home by Jermaine Beckford.         
	Fortunately for the visiting team, the goal was ruled out at the behest of the referees assistant, who had spotted at least one Leeds player in an offside position.         
	With Michael Doyle having missed another good chance, the feeling was that Leeds could end up paying for not making the most of their early superiority.         
	Had it not been for the reflexes of Higgs, the Leeds goalkeeper, that is exactly what would have happened on the stroke of halftime.         
	Having created nothing of note during the opening period, Liverpool almost made the most of a set-piece of their own as Albert Riera sent a header goal-wards from point-blank range only for Higgs to make a dramatic intervention.         
	Beckford is rated by many as the best centre forward plying his trade outside the Premier League, and at the outset of the second half he escaped the attentions of his markers only to fail to beat Diego Cavalieri as he rushed off his line. An energised Beckford next struck an acrobatic overhead kick that narrowly cleared the crossbar.         
	Benitez was growing edgy and summoned Glen Johnson, the substitute, but no sooner had the England full back removed his tracksuit top, than Liverpool had taken the lead through Ngog.         
	It was not the prettiest of goals, but it was important for the French forward as he seeks to confound those who argue he lacks the class to be understudy to the peerless Fernando Torres.         
	Old memories were also being revived at the Britannia Stadium where Stoke City and Blackpool, the two clubs Stanley Matthews played for between 1932 and 1965, fought out a seven-goal thriller, with the last word being Stokes who won 4-3 after Andy Griffin struck six minutes into stoppage time.         
	Arsenal, fielding eight teenagers, beat Championship leaders West Bromwich Albion 2-0 at home with 18-year-old London-born striker Sanchez Watt opening the scoring on his debut and Carlos Vela adding the other.         
	West Broms cause was not helped when former Arsenal trainee Jerome Thomas was sent off in the first half.         
	Arsenal had been the better side throughout, but it took the second-half introduction of Carlos Vela before their territorial and numerical advantage was translated to the scoresheet.         
	It took less than ten minutes for the Mexican striker to make his presence felt, bringing a smart save from Dean Kiely that was followed up by Watt, a 17-year-old Londoner, before scoring a similar tap-in himself after an audacious chip from Mark Randall, a fellow substitute, had hit the bar.         
	In an Arsenal side containing such experienced players as Mikael Silvestre and Philippe Senderos, the 17-year-old did not hesitate to assert his own authority, taking control of the game in a manner that belied his tender years.         
	In the first half-hour he played in two beautifully weighted corners that were headed wide by Senderos, created a great opportunity for Sanchez from which he hit a post and went close to opening the scoring himself after an intrepid run to the edge of West Broms penalty area.         
	Portsmouth, bottom of the Premier League, won 3-1 at League One (third division) Carlisle United but had to come from behind before advancing to the last 16 and Saturdays fourth round draw.         
	In an all-Premier League match Sunderland were 2-0 winners over Birmingham City while Blackburn Rovers won 1-0 at Championship side Nottingham Forest.         
	Bolton beat West Ham United 3-1 after extra time at the Reebok Stadium, while Peterborough also scored a memorable win with a 2-0 victory over Newcastle United.           (REUTERS)

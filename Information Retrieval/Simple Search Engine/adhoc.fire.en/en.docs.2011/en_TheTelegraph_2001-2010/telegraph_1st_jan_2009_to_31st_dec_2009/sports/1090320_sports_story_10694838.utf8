	Indian Wells: Top-ranked Rafael Nadal fended off five match points to take a 3-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-0 victory over nemesis David Nalbandian at the BNP Paribas Open.         
	In a fourth-round match that began about 11 pm Wednesday and lasted until around 2 am Thursday, Nadal climbed back after losing the first set and falling behind 3-5 in the second. He then overcame four match points in the ninth game, and another in the 10th.         
	The 22-year-old Spaniard broke Nalbandians service to pull even at 5-5, then both held. Nadal shot out to a 4-0 lead on his way to winning the tie-breaker and the set. He then dominated the third set against the Argentine player.         
	I was lucky, Nadal said. I didnt go into the match with the best mentality. I didnt have a clear idea of how to play him, probably because I lost the last two matches against him. I have to play my game, and I didnt. I had a big save today (Thursday). I hope to play more aggressive now.         
	Earlier Wednesday, Roger Federer ran his record against Fernando Gonzalez to 12-1 with a three-set victory to also move into the quarter finals. Federer, patchy but good enough to continue his domination of his frequent foe, ousted Gonzalez 6-3, 5-7, 6-2.         
	Andy Roddick rallied in the third set to beat David Ferrer 7-6 (7-5), 3-6, 6-3. Roddick finished with 10 aces against his Spanish opponent, who served eight of his own. Roddick, ranked No. 7, had difficulty handling Ferrers returns in the second set, but he won 15 of 18 first serves in the third.         
	My rhythm on my serve went off in the second set and I guess I was developing a pattern, Roddick said. But he played well. I thought I hit the ball well in the second set. The guys a bulldog and he just does the basics so well. Hes a good player.         
	Andy Murray also advanced, extending his 2009 start to 18-1 when Tommy Robredo retired in the second set of their match because of a wrist injury. Murray won the first set 6-2 and was up 3-0 in the second.         
	Defending champion and No. 3 Novak Djokovic outlasted Stanislas Wawrinka 7-6 (9-7), 7-6 (8-6). Juan Martin del Potro defeated John Isner 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-3), and Ivan Ljubicic downed Igor Andreev 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-4). Fernando Verdasco defeated Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-4, 3-6, 6-1.         
	The quarter final match-ups are Nadal vs Del Potro, Federer versus Verdasco, Roddick versus Djokovic, and Murray versus Ljubicic.         
	On the womens side, No. 11 Victoria Azarenka had an upset win over top seed Dinara Safina 6-7 (4-7), 6-1, 6-3 in a quarter final match. A 19-year-old from Belarus, Azarenka won titles at Brisbane and Memphis earlier this year. No. 6 Vera Zvonareva also advanced, taking a 6-4, 6-2 victory over Caroline Wozniacki in their quarter final.         
	In the past, Zvonareva has let her emotions get the better of her, especially in pressure situations, but she said she would not change the way she is on court.         
	I think Im still an emotional player, because I think I like to create on the court, she said. I like to play a different game, and I think emotion can help and emotion can harm a little bit.         
	I think with experience, I have learned to let the emotions out when I need it, and to focus on myself when I dont need them.         
	Federer, ranked No. 2 after losing his four-year hold on the top spot to Nadal last year, was inconsistent against No. 17 Gonzalez, who fought his way back into the match in the second set. Gonzalez overcame earlier frustration he had vented by slamming a racket onto the court  three times  and shattering it.         
	Federer, the tournament champion three consecutive years beginning in 2004, said he felt he finally was able to establish some rhythm.         
	Today was a bit more baseline, even though I couldnt find his (Gonzalezs) backhand, Federer said. If you dont find his backhand, the point is over quickly. He has such a massive forehand. Im looking forward to playing against Verdasco. Its a good thing that Im still in the tournament and facing an opponent who actually is going to extend the rallies a little bit.         
	Murray, ranked No. 4, said he anticipated a difficult test heading into his match against Robredo.         
	I was expecting a tough match. I had lost to Tommy two previous times I played him, the 21-year-old Scot said. I knew I had to be on my game.         
	Murray said he was aware Robredo had a problem with his wrist, although he still seemed to be hitting the ball ok. But mentally, a wrist problem can be tough, Murray said. I know because Ive been through it. Its just the pain thats there and feeling like something might happen.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Manoj offer for Ishant
                                                   Manoj offer for Ishant
                      
	Jaipur: Former India all-rounder Manoj Prabhakar on Wednesday offered to help struggling pacer Ishant Sharma to do away with his technical flaws and bring back the sting in his bowling.         
	He (Ishant) is one of our main bowlers but has lost his sting, said Prabhakar, the newly appointed coach of Rajasthans Ranji side.         
	If he is being hit, the captain is sure to lose confidence in him. His front is dropping and his wrist is also not locking while delivering the ball. He has to rectify these small technical flaws. If he loses his big in-swinger, it will be a pity, he said.           (PTI)

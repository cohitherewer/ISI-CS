    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  Kolkata Knight Riders cricket manager on the change in captaincy             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              John Buchanan        
	Cape Town: John Buchanan, the Kolkata Knight Riders cricket manager, spoke to The Telegraph at The Cullinan hotel on Saturday. The interview focused on the change in the franchises captaincy, in the lead-up to the IPLs second edition.               
	The following are excerpts:               
	Q Less than a month ago, youd declared that the Knight Riders wouldnt have a fixed captain. Why this change?         
	A Id also said (in Calcutta) that we would use the fortnight leading into the tournament to look at a range of options and the way wed like to run the team... At the end of the day, there could only be one captain, as the laws of the game demand that... After looking at the options, it was felt the best way forward would be to have Brendon McCullum at the helm and hed be supported by Brad Hodge, Sourav Ganguly and Chris Gayle...         
	McCullum has been your choice. Whats his USP?         
	Hes an archetypal 20-over cricketer... His body-language, his enthusiasm, his creativeness, his responsiveness... Those qualities stand out... Hes a genuine all-rounder in that he keeps and bats... Hes good behind the stumps and is as energetic and enthusiastic anywhere else in the field as well... In 20-over cricket, hell lead by example.         
	Are you suggesting Sourav doesnt fit into T20?         
	If you look at the options we have in the team, then everybody has something to offer... (Coach) Matthew Mott and I are trying to get the best out of the team.         
	But the impression is that Sourav alone has been made to pay for the Knight Riders disappointing show in the IPLs inaugural edition, last year...         
	I wouldnt agree with that... No... Sourav knows that he hasnt been held accountable... Hed been part of conversations where the focus had been on the best way forward... We tried different things and different methods in Bloemfontein, before opting for what we think is the best way forward.         
	Quite a few see you as the villain of the piece. Is that a matter of concern?         
	Im sure some will see it that way... But Im hoping that, over time, theyll understand that my decisions are only driven by one motive  to take the Knight Riders forward. The (captaincy) decision has been taken keeping in mind whats best for the franchise.         
	In reaching that decision, were you influenced by McCullum being a much younger cricketer and, therefore, having more to offer in the long-term?         
	Not necessarily... Of course, Im aware Sourav is 36 and will soon be 37... Having said that, I didnt look at age in working on the best dynamics for the team.         
	Given that Sourav is the franchises icon-player, shouldnt the entire captaincy issue been handled better?         
	When you look back on almost everything in life, then you do feel that those things couldve been done a fractionally better... The owners and Sourav were clear about my approach to 20-over cricket and I did have discussions (with Sourav)... What Ive done has nothing to do with Sourav as a person... Nothing has been personal... It hasnt been a personal issue between Sourav and me... In a sense, it also has nothing to do with McCullum... It has everything to do with 20-over cricket.         
	Was it difficult for you when you informed Sourav about his removal?         
	Yes and no... Id already had discussions with Sourav... He still has a role to play in the franchise... He isnt the captain, but that doesnt mean he cant or wont advise.         
	Have you identified the on-field leaders wholl be helping the captain?         
	The group I mentioned earlier  Hodge, Sourav, Gayle... The batting order would be determined by Mott.         
	Today, whats the biggest challenge for you and the Knight Riders?         
	Its ourselves, really... Just being very sure about what we are and what were trying to do... Right now, we have a good understanding of that... The biggest challenge would be to maintain it throughout the tournament... Weve got to keep doing the things were supposed to do... Weather, injuries, travelling... All are going to be factors.         
	Injuries to Wriddhiman Saha and Cheteshwar Pujara couldnt have come at a worse time...         
	Its been a setback, no doubt about it.         
	Would you, at this stage, place one team ahead of the others?         
	No... The wickets will vary, there could be rain and the edition will run till almost the end of May... Therell be dew for the night matches... So, a lot of factors are going to come into play... Also, dont forget that the days second match could play out very differently...         
	How do you rate Deccan Chargers?         
	I wouldnt read a lot into their finishing last in the inaugural season.         
	The final one: Are you under a lot more pressure now?         
	(Grins) Even if that is so, Im not necessarily feeling it... The players and the support staff have done everything that couldve been done in the past fortnight... Well have to begin delivering from Sunday.

                                                     Kimiko becomes 2nd oldest WTA winner
                  Kimiko Date Krumm with the trophy in Seoul on Sunday                     
	Seoul: Japans Kimiko Date Krumm became the oldest player to win a Womens Tennis Association (WTA) tournament since Billie Jean King when she capped a remarkable comeback by beating second-seeded Anabel Medina Garrigues of Spain 6-3, 6-3 to claim the Korea Open title Sunday.         
	The title was Date Krumms first in 13 years and eighth of her career. Formerly ranked No. 4 in the world, she quit tennis in 1996 before returning to the sport last year.         
	Date Krumm, who turns 39 on Monday, became the oldest woman to win a WTA title since Billie Jean King won one at Birmingham, England, in 1983 at the age of 39 years, seven months and 23 days.         
	Yeah, of course, very happy, Date Krumm said of her win. I realised one more time after this game that we dont know about tennis unless we actually play it.         
	Date Krumm, beat top-seeded Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia 7-6 (3), 4-6, 6-4 in the quarter finals and advanced to the final after rallying to beat defending champion Maria Kirilenko of Russia 3-6, 6-2, 6-4.         
	She made short work of Medina Garrigues in the final, winning in one hour, 27 minutes.         
	The Korea Open was Date Krumms first WTA title since beating Spains Arantxa Sanchez Vicario at San Diego in August 1996.         
	She said she is confident she can play professional tennis for at least a couple of more years.         
	I think I wont have any problem in my physical strength over the next five years. But Im married ... have to have kids and have a lot of things to do, she said. I think I can play tennis for the next two years.           (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Advantage is with Indians
                                                                                                                       7                                      Advantage is with Indians
            A CORRESPONDENT                                  India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, with Virender Sehwag, during a practice   session in Jamtha, near Nagpur, on Tuesday. (PTI)      
	Nagpur: Move over Test matches, its back to the money-spinning Twenty20s.         
	India, No.1 in Tests, would look to extend their supremacy to the shortest format of the game when they take on Sri Lanka in the first T20 at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium, in nearby Jamtha, on Wednesday.         
	India have struggled in this format since winning the world title in 2007. In nine T20 Internationals since 2008, they have lost six and won three. The first victory was a remarkable come-from-behind effort in Sri Lanka, the other two were against Bangladesh and Ireland, during a disastrous World Twenty20 campaign in England this year.         
	However, Virender Sehwag, who had missed the tournament in England, is back and has been in superb form in the Test series.         
	But there is a question mark over Sreesanths availability. The pacer is down with a stomach bug.         
	Sreesanth is not well. We are hoping he will get well before the game, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said.         
	I dont know the exact scene right now. The physio (Nitin Patel) told me he was not well, may be he is suffering from diarrhoea or something, Dhoni added.         
	If Sreesanth fails to recover in time, the choice will be between Sudeep Tyagi and Ashok Dinda for the third pacers slot. A final decision would be taken at the team meeting on Wednesday morning, as is the norm for day-night matches.         
	Tyagi was in the squad for the seven-match one-day series against Australia, but didnt get to play a single match. Dinda, on the other hand, has earned a call-up to the national side for the first time.         
	The islanders would also be hoping that their flamboyant veteran opener Sanath Jayasuriya  who has joined the squad for the second part of the tour  and in-form opener Tillekaratne Dilshan, would be able to answer the assault of Sehwag and Gambhir at the top.         
	Sri Lanka have not yet made up their mind whether the 40-year-old Jayasuriya would open the innings.         
	Sanath has been very successful against India as an opener, and against all oppositions, too. But right now he has a different role to play for us in the side... Whether he will bat at the top or down in the middle, all these options can be considered later, he said.         
	Our responsibility towards the team and towards Sanath is to make sure that, when he plays, he becomes a match winner. Hes willing to make that change. It is an exciting time to play a new role, he said.         
	In the only previous T20 clash between the two teams, in February this year in Colombo, Jayasuriya (33) and Dilshan (61), who led the side, opened the Lanka batting and put on 59 in less than six overs.         
	That contest was won by India when the Pathan brothers  Yusuf and Irfan  guided them home .

	New York: World No. 1 Roger Federer will begin his bid to win a record sixth consecutive US Open against American wild card Devin Britton after the draw was made on Thursday.         
	The Swiss, who won the French Open and Wimbledon titles this year to set a record of 15 Grand Slam singles titles, is scheduled to play fourth seed Novak Djokovic of Serbia in the semi-finals.         
	Top seed Federer and No. 3 Nadal were drawn into opposite halves of the field.         
	They have played in seven major finals as numbers 1-2, including at each of the other three Grand Slam tournaments, with Nadal holding a 5-2 edge.         
	But because Nadal recently fell to third in the rankings, there was a possibility the two men who have dominated tennis in recent years would wind up on the same side of the bracket in New York.         
	Serena and Venus Williams will not be able to reprise their sibling rivalry in the years last Grand Slam final.         
	The Williams sisters wont have a rematch of their Wimbledon final, in which Serena beat Venus for her 11th Grand Slam singles title.         
	That was the sisters eighth all-in-the-family final at a major, and Serena leads 6-2.         
	But at the U.S. Open, the second-seeded Serena and No. 3 Venus were drawn for a possible semi-final clash.         
	Womens champion Serena begins her campaign against American wildcard Alexa Glatch.         
	I am still playing very well, Federer said at the draw.         
	I played great in Cincinnati (where he won the Masters Series event last weekend) and I hope things can go well at the US Open.         
	Speaking on his first round opponent Britton, Federer said: I think he believes again he can win big tournaments.         
	He was so close at Wimbledon. It has changed him. I think he has improved as a player in the past year or two. I also see him going deep into the tournament again at the Open, he added.         
	Federer could play two-time major champion Lleyton Hewitt in the third round, James Blake in the fourth, and French Open runner-up Robin Soderling in the quarter finals.         
	Second seed Andy Murray, runner-up last year and chasing his first grand slam crown, could face third seed Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals.         
	Scot Murray will begin against Latvian Ernests Gulbis while Spaniard Nadal, who missed Wimbledon because of tendinitis in his knees, takes on Frenchman Richard Gasquet in one of the highlights of round one.         
	Fourth seed Djokovic will play Croatian Ivan Ljubicic and former champion Andy Roddick, the leading American seed at number five, takes on Bjorn Phau of Germany in round one.         
	Djokovic and Roddick are seeded to face each other in the quarter finals.         
	World No. 1 Safina, still chasing her first grand slam title, plays Australian wildcard Olivia Rogowska in the opening round while Venus takes on another Russian Vera Dushevina.         
	Former champion Maria Sharapova, seeded 29, starts against Bulgarian Tsvetana Pironkova and could face fourth seed Elena Dementieva in round three.         
	Sharapova has, however, downplayed her chances of winning a second US Open crown this year after returning from shoulder surgery but believes she can go on to regain the world No.1 spot.         
	With every tournament I feel physically Im getting better and getting a good sense of the court but its still a work in progress, the three-time Grand Slam winner said. Id like to forget I was gone for a long time but you have to put things in perspective.         
	The 22-year-old Russian, who only returned to singles action in May after a nine-month layoff, said she would certainly give the US Open her best shot and was absolutely sure of climbing back to the tennis summit.         
	Belgian former world No. 1 Kim Clijsters, who returned to the tour this month after a two-year layoff, will play Viktoriya Kutuzova of Ukraine in round one.         
	The 2005 champion could play Venus Williams in the fourth round.         
	The US Open begins on Monday.

	Astana: An injury-time goal from Niko Kranjcar gave Croatia a 2-1 win over Kazakhstan on Wednesday but it was not enough to clinch a playoff place for next years World Cup finals.         
	The Croatians will miss the finals for the first time since they started competing as an independent nation in 1991 after Ukraine secured the runners-up spot in Group Six and a playoff berth with a 6-0 drubbing of Andorra.         
	England had earlier won the group to secure automatic qualification for next years tournament.         
	Ukraine finished second with 21 points from 10 games, one more than Croatia.         
	Midfielder Ognjen Vukojevic headed in a Darijo Srna corner to give Croatia an early lead, but their celebrations were muted several minutes later by news that Andriy Shevchenko had fired Ukraine ahead in Andorra.         
	The Kazakhs equalised with a flowing team move in the 26th minute, when striker Sergey Khizhnichenko swept in a good low cross from the right by Yevgeniy Averchenko.         
	Croatia twice hit the woodwork and the home teams goalkeeper Alexandr Mokin produced a string of superb saves before Kranjcar headed in Srnas cross from the right to give the 1998 World Cup semi-finalists some consolation.         
	Croatia coach Slaven Bilic said poor finishing had cost his team a place in the finals and declined to answer whether he would stay in charge.         
	We will sit down in a few days and analyse the entire situation with the rest of the staff and the FA officials before I make a decision, he told Croatian television.         
	For Ukraine, Shevchenko scored in the 22nd minute before a second-half flurry of goals from Oleg Gusev, Yaroslav Rakytskiy, Andriy Yarmolenko and substitute Yevgen Seleznov sealed the victory at the Comunal Stadium in Andorra. Ildefons Lima added an own-goal.         
	Germany, already through, needed a last-gasp equaliser by Lukas Podolski to grab a 1-1 draw with eliminated Finland in their final qualifier on Wednesday.         
	Germany, who beat second-placed Russia 1-0 on Saturday to seal top spot in Group Four, went behind after 11 minutes. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | East go down in 3 days
                                                   East go down in 3 days
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: East Zones batting blues continued as they capitulated for the second time and crashed to an eight-wicket defeat against West Zone in the Duleep Trophy semi-final at the Brabourne Stadium here Saturday.         
	East had the copyrights to write their own success story as they went into the third and penultimate day with a slender overall lead of 17 runs and seven wickets in hand. But what they came up with was a horrible script that would haunt them forever.         
	Resuming at 128 for three, the visitors were bundled out for 200 in 68.3 overs with 15 minutes to go for lunch.         
	The hosts had no problem in overhauling the target with a day and a half to spare. Parthiv Patel anchored the chase with an unbeaten 54.         
	The East batsmen, who were found wanting in technique against the moving ball on the opening day, showed no signs of having learnt the lessons as they kept poking at moving deliveries.         
	Five of the seven batsmen to fall were caught behind the wicket to seamers.

                                                                                                                                                               PCB fumes over Younis comments
    Karachi: Younis Khan rsquo;s comment that Pakistan is in a state of war has upset the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), which feels the national skipper rsquo;s statement will hurt the country rsquo;s chances of convincing the ICC that it is safe to play cricket here.
    ldquo;It was an unnecessary statement and obviously there are some areas on which players should not air their views, rdquo; PCB rsquo;s chief operating officer Saleem Altaf said.
    Altaf said the PCB had a word with the manager Yawar Saeed in England. ldquo;I think our players need to be careful with their remarks. But certainly Younis rsquo;s remarks are not helpful to our cause, rdquo; he added.
    Pak stand
    Karachi: The PCB has softened its stand on dragging the ICC to court over the hosting rights of the 2011 World Cup and is now keen for an out of court settlement with the sport rsquo;s world governing body. 
    ldquo;Neither is the PCB interested in wasting its money on a legal battle nor do we want the ICC to spend its money meant for development of cricket on legal expenses, rdquo; Butt said.
    Kumble rsquo;s take
    Calcutta: Former India captain Anil Kumble has picked Australia and South Africa as India rsquo;s challengers for retaining the World Twenty20 title. Kumble, who joined the ESPN STAR Sports commentary panel on Friday, said India have the side to win the tournament for the second time in a row but they need to guard against complacency.  Odumbe case
    New Delhi: Former Kenya skipper Maurice Odumbe, who completes his five year ban this August, blamed the ICC for mishandling his case and destroying his career. ldquo;I was accused of knowing somebody, not of match fixing. The world never heard my story. I was not given a chance to prove my innocence. They had to prove me guilty and they did that, rdquo; Odumbe said. 
    Lorgat view
    Melbourne: The sellout crowd of the India-Pakistan warm-up match at Oval underlined the format rsquo;s growing popularity but ICC would not fall for its lure and slot more Twenty20 matches in its calendar, ICC CEO Haroon Lorgat said.
  ldquo;It is always tempting to have more but it rsquo;s not clever to have more, rdquo; Lorgat told a British daily.   Renovation
    Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal working committee on Friday decided to award the contract for the renovation of Eden to Jai Mehta rsquo;s VMS and US-based Burt Hill. It was also decided that the pension of former Bengal players will be hiked.

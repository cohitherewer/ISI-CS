The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | It will be tough: Bhutia
                                                   It will be tough: Bhutia
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutia finally signed for East Bengal on Wednesday afternoon. And then in the evening, at a press conference, he pledged for a new beginning with the club where he started it all in the early 90s.         
	I dont want to talk about the past, Bhaichung said, after receiving his favourite No. 15 jersey. Im very happy to be back in East Bengal.         
	This will be the first time in many years that the club will go into the I-League without any foreign player. It will be tough but I want the team to play their hearts out. Its all about combining well. Ive practised with the team for the past couple of days and Ive realised that they are a strong team, he added. East Bengal leave for Pune on Thursday where Pune FC play host on Saturday.         
	The red and gold brigade are having a tough time recruiting foreign players. After giving the likes of Jan Berger, Edmilson the boot, East Bengal now are hoping that Ghanian striker Yusif Yakubu sorts out his visa problem and arrive at the earliest.         
	They thought that Julius Akpele would strengthen the defence but an MRI scan on the day revealed that his knee injury has still not healed. So no more of Julius. Bhaichung said Yakubus arrival will bolster the team. We need someone like him, he said.         
	 Meanwhile, Mohun Bagan maintained that they would fight till the end.

  - Lanka amass 319/8 as dilshan scores 2nd fastest century in trophy               Kumar Sangakkara tries to run out Graeme Smith at the SuperSport Park in Centurion on Tuesday. (AP)                           
	Centurion: South Africas inability to perform on the big stage became the talking point once again here Tuesday as Sri Lanka piled on 319 for eight in the Champions Trophy opener. Tillekaratne Dilshan led the charge with a 92-ball 106.               
	At midnight, South Africa were 136/4 in 25 overs. AB de Villiers (22) and Mark Boucher (13) were at the crease               
	Hostss captain Graeme Smiths decision to field after winning the toss backfired as the Lankan top order, barring Sanath Jayasuriya, sent the South Africans on a leather hunt. A promising start by Dale Steyn swiftly dissipated into a run fest in Centurion. After Dilshan set the tone with the second-fastest century in Champions Trophy history, Mahela Jayawardene ensured Sri Lanka didnt lose steam after a double blow. Sri Lanka have lost only once after posting a 300-plus total in one-day Internationals.         
	Smith had a smile on his face when the toss went his way and Steyn removed Jayasuriya, but it was soon replaced by a frown. While Steyn bowled four tidy overs, the rest of the pace attack sprayed the ball around. The first to feel Dilshans force was Wayne Parnell, whose opening spell suggested he was a tad awed by sharing the new ball with Steyn in the tournament opener.         
	Parnell, preferred to Makhaya Ntini, struggled to hit a consistent length and went for 39 in five overs. When he dropped fractionally short, Dilshan hammered him through mid-wicket and slashed past backward point; when he tried a slower, Dilshan scooped him from off stump over Mark Boucher for four. Parnell dragging the ball down and Dilshan pinging the deep point and mid-wicket boundaries was a recurring sight in the early overs.         
	The first 10 overs yielded 70, yet Smith opted for the second Powerplay and introduced Albie Morkel. Dilshan welcomed him with a four, raised his half-century with another thrash, and finished off the 14th over by smashing a free hit for six over mid-wicket.         
	South Africa went in with two spinners and, while they stemmed the flow of boundaries, Sri Lanka ticked along at more than six an over. Johan Botha and Roelof van der Merwe bowled decent spells but lacked bite. Sangakkara eschewed the risks and was the ideal second fiddle to Dilshan. Dabs, drives, flicks, angled bats, and punches  all evaded fielders as Sangakkara brought up his first half-century since February.         
	Jean Paul Duminy came on in the 28th over and Dilshan eased two off-side boundaries before turning a quick single to short fine leg to reach three figures. South Africa threatened to claw back when Sangakkara chipped a catch back to Duminy, and Dilshan slashed Steyns first delivery on return to thirdman, but the next pair ensured the innings did not fall apart.         
	Jayawardene was his usual self: cutting, nudging and pushing into the gaps with excellent timing.

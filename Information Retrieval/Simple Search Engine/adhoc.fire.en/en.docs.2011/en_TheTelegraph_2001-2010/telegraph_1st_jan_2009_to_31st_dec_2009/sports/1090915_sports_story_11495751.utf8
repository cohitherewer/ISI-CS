The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wright is doubtful
                                                   Wright is doubtful
                      
	Loughborough: England may be without all-rounder Luke Wright for Wednesdays fifth one-day International against Australia after he was injured in training.         
	Wright, who has averaged just 19.75 with the bat but bowled economically in Englands four losses so far, needed stitches in a toe injury after he was hit while batting against the machine at the National Cricket Performance Centre on Tuesday.         
	England called up Dimitri Mascarenhas as cover, in case Wright does not recover for the match at Trent Bridge, which counts for little with England 0-4 down with three games remaining.

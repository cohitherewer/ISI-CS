  - Sourav rules out contesting CAB polls       A STAFF REPORTER            Sourav Ganguly at the inauguration of a cafe on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly on Friday termed as unfortunate former Australia coach John Buchanans jibe at some of Indias greatest cricketers, including Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar, in his new book.         
	I have not read the book... I just have seen some bits on the internet and feel all these things were uncalled for. He should not have written such stuff. He has done well for Australia as a coach. People hold him in high esteem and all these were unnecessary.         
	I dont think this should have happened I think, we Indians are used to it now. So, its unfortunate and we just got to deal with it, the former India captain said at the inauguration of Javagreen Cafe in Behala, owned by Vaishali, daughter of crickets one-time strongman Jagmohan Dalmiya.         
	The book, titled The Future of Cricket: The Rise of Twenty20, mainly deals with the Indian Premier League (IPL) but Buchanan has made some scathing observations on the Indian cricketers.         
	[Buchanan, incidentally, didnt spare Sourav too in his book. Convinced that he was unfit for Twenty20 cricket, he had asked the left-hander to quit after the first edition of the IPL.         
	Sourav responded to my frank assessment by claiming he had at least one more year of Twenty20 cricket in him. He told me his main aim was to get into the Test side against Australia, an aim he did achieve before announcing his Test retirement, Buchanan observed. He basically said to me: Thank you for your concerns, but I dont agree with what you are saying.]         
	Buchanan was formally sacked last month as the Kolkata Knight Riders head of cricket operations following the teams pathetic performance in the second edition of the IPL. The Shah Rukh Khan-owned franchise, which had finished No. 6 in the inaugural edition, ended at the bottom of the table in South Africa.         
	His stint with the Knight Riders triggered a massive controversy before this years edition of the IPL when he put forward the concept of multiple leaders in the team.         
	The team replaced Sourav with Brendon McCullum as captain days before the start and finished with just three wins from 14 matches.         
	Sourav dismissed any chances of his contesting the CAB elections this year.         
	I dont want to talk about the CAB elections. I have just said that I want to come into administration There is no guarantee. I have not entered into administration yet and people are thinking of 2014. Its disappointing actually.         
	Playing cricket and administration are two different things. When I played for India, I got good wishes from my teammates, and by just announcing my intent, I have been reading so many stories.         
	This is all speculation. I have not decided anything, and as I said, its not about fighting elections. Its about trying to help the game. I want to be at a place from where I can help the game. Its how they take it, he said.         
	Souravs comments only confirm that his chances of contesting for the CAB presidents post this time are remote.         
	Sourav also took the opportunity to wish Sunil Gavaskar on his 60th birthday.         
	At this age, you dont want to be reminded of your birthday I dont want to remind him (of his age) and just wish him all the happiness. Ive sent him my good wishes... Sourav said.         
	I have a lot of good memories of him. I have watched him play. I have seen him closely as a commentator. I have gone to him at times for technical help. I hold him in high esteem and have a personal relationship with him.         
	Asked whether he considers Gavaskar as his role model, Sourav said: Of course. He is one of the greatest Indian batsmen.         
	Sourav, who will be leaving for London on Tuesday to lecture at the University of Oxford as part of ICCs centenary celebrations, said he would watch a few days of Ashes during his stay there.         
	Sourav said Australia were missing a spinner more than a pacer but still they can win the Ashes.         
	Australia can still win without Brett Lee. I think they are missing a spinner more than a pacer, he added.         
	He also made it clear that he is not in favour of ICC president David Morgans suggestion for four-day Test matches.         
	I dont know whether there will be four days Test. For me, Test cricket is still five days and thats why its Test cricket.

  - Nehru Cup: Lebanon defender Saad scores match-winner         JAYDEEP BASU            Bhaichung Bhutia tries to get past Lebanon captain Bilal El Najjarine during their Nehru Cup match in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                 
	New Delhi: Defending champions India were brought down to earth when they went down to an inspired Lebanon 0-1 in the opening match of the ONGC-Nehru Cup at the Ambedkar Stadium on Wednesday.         
	Watched by a near capacity crowd, that cheered the Indians whenever they got the ball, the hosts were done in by an opening five-minute blitz by Lebanon, who picked up the all-important goal during this period.         
	Thereafter, India made repeated efforts to repair the damage and had their share of chances in the first half but the equaliser remained elusive. The Indian coach Bob Houghton brought in the experienced Sunil Chetri in place of Sushil Singh in the attacking line but the move hardly paid any dividend.         
	The Indians were certainly not overwhelmed by a team that beat them comprehensively twice in the World Cup qualifiers only two years ago. Put into arrears as early as in the fourth minute, the Bhaichung Bhutias tried their best but ran out of ideas once they reached the top of the rival box.         
	Lebanon really caught the Indian defenders on the wrong foot in the first five minutes and struck the only goal of the match through defender Ali Ad Saad, who scored off a neatly executed free kick.         
	After winger Mohammed El Ali twice broke through the right in the opening minutes, he once again found himself placed favourably on the top of the Indian box when the match was only four minutes old. Ali was brought down by Climax Lawrence and Ali Ad Saad cracked a right footed free kick that struck the corner of the net.         
	Thankfully for the Indians, the visitors could never generate the same pace again. Backed by a strong and crowded midfield, Lebanon were the more dominant force but that could not deter India from making repeated moves at the rival goalmouth.         
	India could have found the net in the ninth minute itself when Steven Dias found Bhaichung Bhutia inside the box with a measured cross. The entire Lebanon defence heaved a sign of relief when the Indian captain reacted late and let the chance go astray.         
	Lebanon had done their homework and tactically looked a much superior side. They won most of the aerial balls and created gaping holes in the Indian defence on the break. Speed was the factor the Lebanese relied upon but they failed to finish.         
	That the Indians could not avail the chances that came their way was the biggest problem. Sushil Singh looked the most enthusiastic man in the Indian forwardline but was not able to cash in on the opportunities. Once his header missed the target narrowly, and the next time the Lebanon goalkeeper Lary Mehanna effected an acrobatic save to deny the young striker a chance to get his name in the scoresheet.         
	More was expected from the Indians in the second session. While the midfielders, especially Dias and NP Pradeep did well to take charge of the middle, neither Bhutia not Chetri displayed the extra grit needed to break the organised Lebanese defence. If Houghton thought that the experienced Chetri would be more effective, he was definitely let down by the local boy.

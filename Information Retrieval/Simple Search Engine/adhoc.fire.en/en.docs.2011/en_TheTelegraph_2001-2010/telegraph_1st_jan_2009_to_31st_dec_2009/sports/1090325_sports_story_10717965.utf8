The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tendulkar: It has never been so exciting 
                                                   Tendulkar: It has never been so exciting 
                      
	Auckland: Sachin Tendulkar is relishing the success of the Indian cricket team and admits that in his 20 years of association with the game, the time has never been as exciting as it has been in the last three-four years.         
	The master batsman, who has 85 international hundreds  42 in Tests and 43 in ODIs  said that the teams victory in New Zealand was indeed satisfying.         
	It is good for Rahul (Dravid) and myself to be part of a winning team. Weve been here on earlier tours, but it wasnt so good. But it is better late than never.         
	These are exciting times for Indian cricket. It has been quite satisfying. The Test victory is very special. We have been able to achieve that in the last few years wherever we have travelled. I am glad that we made it possible here as well, said Tendulkar, who had a strenuous net session at the Eden Park.         
	Tendulkar attributed the teams brilliant performance to its all-round capability.         
	It has been an all-round performance that has seen us do consistently well. We just needed a break and that came in Zimbabwe (2001), he said.         
	After that we went to the West Indies and won a Test there. We won in England and South Africa too. We did that in Australia as well. So wherever we have travelled we have created an impact. That is what the nation was looking for and we are glad that we have done it, Tendulkar added.         
	Speaking about the ongoing series, the Mumbaikar said, It has been fantastic so far and we are looking forward to the rest of the tour. If we win the Test series, it would make the tour better.         
	However the disappointment of the Indian Premier League being moved out of India still lingered. It is always special to play cricket in India. Playing in Mumbai was special, said Tendulkar.         
	With the majority of the cricketers returning home after a 45-day sojourn of New Zealand on April 9, Tendulkar felt that it would be tough on them to spend more time away from their families.

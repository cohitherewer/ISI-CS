                                                   Code must to keep sport clean: Lorgat
                      
	Dubai: An International Cricket Council (ICC) lawyer will be in Mumbai on Saturday to discuss a contentious anti-doping code with BCCI officials as the Indian players have refused to sign it, complaining that one of its clauses invaded on their privacy.         
	ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said Iain Higgins, the governing bodys company lawyer, will also make it clear to the BCCI that there is no further reason to delay the full implementation of the requirements specified by the Wada Code.         
	The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) code requires that players reveal their whereabouts in an online form. Lorgat said an overwhelming majority of players have already given their consent to the clause except for the Indian players.         
	Lorgat said the ICC understood the players concerns, but has to adhere to the Wada code in order to keep the sport clean.         
	The anti-doping measures were absolutely necessary, quite like the security checks that are done at all airports these days, Lorgat told a cricket website.         
	During the trial period, the overwhelming majority of players from all countries, except India, submitted whereabouts information, Lorgat added.         
	I understand and appreciate that there will be some concerns and reservations from all players and I am sure they feel that those concerns are genuine. However, the ICC has spent the past few months addressing all of those concerns, and, having taken great care to do so, we see no further reason to delay the full implementation of the requirements specified by the Wada Code.         
	Lorgat, however, conceded that players would be uncomfortable divulging information which is essentially personal.         
	I understand that submitting details of your whereabouts in advance is not something everyone would want to do and I understand the concerns of players and their associations who may consider such a move an infringement of their private space, Lorgat said.         
	Lorgat said the ICC might even consider making some changes to the code after reviewing it at the end of the year.           (AGENCIES)

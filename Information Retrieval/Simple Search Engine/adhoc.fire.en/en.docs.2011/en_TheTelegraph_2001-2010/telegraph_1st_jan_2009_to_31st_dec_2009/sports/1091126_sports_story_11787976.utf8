            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Edeh Chidi couldnt be any happier. Getting his third hattrick, and 11th goal, of the season so far, the Nigerian said scoring was his duty.         
	Its my job to get more goals and, so, Im doing exactly that, the Mohun Bagan striker said. It was a good game overall and Im hoping to get a few more in the following matches, be it in the I-League or the local league.         
	His last two hattricks had come in the I-League  against East Bengal and Pune FC.         
	Japanese player Ryuji Sueoka made his Bagan debut in the match and Chidi seemed impressed with the Asian quota player.         
	Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa was pleased with the result. I think this is Chidis best season so far in India, the Moroccan said.         
	Bencharifa, too, seemed optimistic about the Japanese midfielder. Ive known him since 2004 and am very optimistic about him, he said. The team is playing and performing well The juniors too.

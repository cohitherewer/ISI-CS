The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ECB dinosaurs must be removed
                                                   ECB dinosaurs must be removed
                              GUEST COLUMN    Geoffrey Boycott      
	The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) have removed the captain and coach but the two who should have been sacked are still there. David Collier, the chief executive, and Hugh Morris, the managing director, put Peter Moores in charge without advertising the position and they both had a say, along with the selectors, in appointing Kevin Pietersen four months ago.         
	On Sunday Pietersen told his side of the story. He is quoted as saying that before he left India: The last words from Collier and Morris during the last Test match in India were for me to do a strategy plan as to how I wanted to take the English cricket team forward.         
	They asked him. He did not give them the ultimatum. They requested a report. When they got the report they obviously didnt like what he said because he wanted a coach to be my ally who I trusted and was tactically aware. I didnt have that.         
	That was his reason for saying he could not continue with Moores as coach. He was not saying he wanted to resign. He was being truthful and frank and for that he got the bullet.         
	If they had kept Moores against Petersons advice and sacked the captain it would have been the wrong decision but there would have been some kind of logic. To sack the coach they must have felt he was not up to his job because Moores has not said anything. He has been very diplomatic.         
	Moores must have thought if he kept quiet the ECB wouldnt have noticed he was not very good at his job. But they did. They sacked him. So they must have felt he was not up to it. I say it again, this is the guy they appointed without advertising the job.         
	Collier and Morris agreed Pietersen could go on holiday and a meeting with the ECB was fixed for the day of his return. He presented his ideas by email on New Year Eve. But before he could sit down with Collier and Morris he was relieved of his position by a phone call from Morris accepting his resignation followed by an email.         
	He had not resigned but they apparently chose to take umbrage at his ideas and turned his report around in order to get rid of him. This was a masterstroke of double dealing and bad man-management. It is an appalling way to treat any England cricketer and particularly the captain.         
	If Morris and Collier thought he was not up to the job they should not have appointed him.         
	Once they sacked Moores, why get rid of the captain? Why ask him for his way forward in the first place if you are not going to give him support?         
	Giles Clarke, the chairman of the ECB, is up for election in March. He projects this image of being a strong leader who will front up. That is good.         
	But at the moment his silence is deafening; it is not good enough to disappear when the flak is flying. He is the only man who can force Collier and Morris to give a proper explanation.         
	There are a lot of questions that Morris and Collier should be answering. So far they have acted like dinosaurs telling the public nothing. Collier and Morris will try to keep quiet and hope it will all blow over just because they have now appointed a good man who will be no trouble as captain and everyone likes him.         
	If that is what they thought was best for English cricket why didnt they do it four months ago?         
	 In Andrew Strausss own words he has changed his game to play a Test anchor role which is not suitable for one-dayers, a game he has not played for nearly two years.         
	We are not the best cricket team but we are the best at making ourselves a laughing stock.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

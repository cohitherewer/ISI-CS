            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: P.C. Lalawmpuiya was ecstatic after scoring the match-winner against Punjab in the Santosh Trophy quarter final at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Chennai on Saturday.         
	I am very happy. Bengal badly needed a goal at that time and I am happy that I played a part in that, he said. We always thought we had a chance to advance to the semi-finals. So we never gave up. Even after the score was 1-1, we tried and tried And was aptly rewarded, he said.         
	Lalawmpuiyas match-winner was his third goal of the tournament and he has promised to score some more. I am having a dream tournament. I am confident of getting some more for Bengal, he said.         
	Bengals coach Raghu Nandy was also happy. We were confident of winning this match. This Punjab team lacked their usual vigour and we knew we had our chances, he said.

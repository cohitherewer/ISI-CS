	Centurion: Defending champions Australia pulled off a dramatic last-ball victory over Pakistan in a low scoring thriller Wednesday to romp into the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy putting an end to Indias listless campaign.         
	The Australians had to rely on their tailenders to achieve the two-wicket victory in a nail-biting contest which saw fortune fluctuating from one team to the other till the very end.         
	Australia restricted Pakistan to a modest 205 for six and then managed to scamper home on a spongy SuperSport Park track to knock India out of the eight-nation tournament.         
	The Aussies were cruising along comfortably at 157 for three at one stage before losing five wickets in quick secession that completely changed the complexion of the game.         
	Needing four runs to win from the last five balls, Brett Lee and Nathan Hauritz took the team home much to the relief of a tense Australian dressing room.         
	The Aussies completed their Group A engagement with five points and moved into the semi-finals as the top team from their group.         
	They had earlier defeated the West Indies while their match against India was washed out.         
	Earlier, it was a disciplined bowling display by the Australians who exploited the conditions well to restrict Pakistan with only Kamran Akmal (44), Mohammed Yousuf (45) and Misbah-ul Haq (41) being the notable scorers.         
	The Aussies then rode on Michael Husseys defiant 64 to scamper home, but not before some hiccups which provided a nail-biting end to the contest.         
	Captain Ricky Ponting (32) and Tim Paine (29) also chipped in with useful scores.         
	Put into bat, Akmal, Yousuf and Misbah provided a semblance of resistance on a tricky Centurion pitch to leave the Aussies to score at 4.10 runs per over to secure a berth in the semi-finals.         
	Akmals knock, during which he struck six boundaries, helped Pakistan recover from early jolts, while Yousuf tried to hold the innings together with a defiant 69-ball 45.         
	Pakistan started on an attacking note with Shahid Afridi, promoted to open the batting, cracking two boundaries off paceman Peter Siddle in the second over of the innings.         
	But Afridi (15), who struck three boundaries during his brief 18-ball stay, failed to make it big and became the first man to depart when his ambitious pull off Mitchell Johnson (2/45) found James Hopes in square-leg region in the eighth over.         
	Chasing the modest target, Australia got off to a good start as Shane Watson (24) and Paine produced a 44-run opening partnership, before Watson fell prey to paceman Umar Gul in the ninth over         
	Australia suffered their second loss when Afridi trapped Pain before the stumps after three overs.         
	Ponting came in when Australia were at 59 for two and with Hussey added 81 runs to the board. Ponting (32), who struck just one boundary during his 64-ball stay, was patient during his stay.         
	Hussey, who struck six fours and a six during the 87-ball innings, fell prey to Naved-ul Hasan in the 41st over, leaving Australia at 174 for five.         
	The contest took an interesting turn when Mohammed Asif, playing his first match after the end of a year-long ban, struck twice in the 42nd over.         
	After dismissing Hopes (1), Asif also scalped Cameron White (5) just after three balls in the same over.         
	However, Lee and Hauritz held their nerves to complete the task for Australia.           (PTI)

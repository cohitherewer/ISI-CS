	Calcutta: Life is elsewhere for Mohun Bagan and Al-Wehdat. When the two teams cross swords Tuesday at the Howrah Stadium in an AFC Cup Group D match, their priorities, for sure, will not be the outcome of the tie.         
	Reason is simple. If Bagan are more worried about their prospects in the I-League  they need to win their remaining five matches  starting from March 23, for their first I-League title in seven years, the Jordanian club are eyeing glory in the lucrative Arab Champions League which is worth $400,000. They have a quarter final second leg lined up on Saturday at Wydad of Casablanca and, up 2-1 in the first leg, they are surely fancying their chances.         
	So, it is not surprising that the visitors are in town without five of their regular players.         
	We had a tiring last 10 days. The Arab Champions League match against Wydad, AFC Cup match against Kuwait FC, and now this away trip. And from here we are going straight to Casablanca. We need fresh legs for that match and hence the decision to rest some of the key players, a senior Al-Wehdat official said on Tuesday.         
	If the visitors are without five regulars, Bagan will be without four first team players. Marcos Pereira, N.S. Manju and Habibur Rahman will be rested, while Jose Ramirez Barreto is recovering from a back injury.         
	We have played too many matches this season and the players are naturally tired. To keep them fresh for the I-League, I have adopted a rotation policy, Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa said on Tuesday. So, you may see Lalkamal Bhowmick playing in Marcoss place and Dipak Mondal partnering Peter Odafe in central defence. You have to know your priorities, Bencharifa said, defending his move. Skipper Bhaichung Bhutia is expected to start even though there were some indications that he might be on the bench.                 
	Even though Al-Wehdat, who played out a 1-1 draw at home against Kuwait FC in the first match, look depleted on paper, they have enough ammunition to make a mark. Tactically a strong side who like to move forward, Al-Wehdat will cause the Bagan defence a few problems on Tuesday. For a team who have scored 39 goals in their local league  they are leading the table right now  finding the net is not a problem. In Hassan Abdel Fattah and Amar Deeb, the visitors have two fantastic players who also represent the Jordan national team. Hassan, a very stylish midfielder, in fact came on as a substitute and scored a brace against South Korea in a World Cup qualifier last summer.         
	With no Marcos in the midfield, the onus will be on Rakesh Masih to keep the spine firm. Masih hasnt been in the best of forms in the last couple of I-League matches and will like to turn it around this time.         
	For the record, Al-Wehdat would have good memories of Calcutta. In their visit a year back, they trounced East Bengal 4-2 at the Salt Lake Stadium in an AFC Cup match. But defender Haythem Semrin, told mediamen on Monday that they were not expecting a similar result against Mohun Bagan. We saw their AFC Cup match against Al-Karama (Bagan lost 0-1) and were really impressed. We cant take them lightly, he said.         
	Very true. Bagans reserve bench did a commendable job in Syria and had Marcos not muffed the penalty they could have returned with a point at least. Will they be able to produce a similar performance against Al Wehdat? You never know.         
	Kick off is at 2.30 pm.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Andrew Symonds back, Ricky Ponting rested
                                                   Andrew Symonds back, Ricky Ponting rested
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Captain Ricky Ponting, experienced batsman Michael Hussey and pace spearhead Mitchell Johnson were Wednesday left out of the 14-man Australian squad while Andrew Symonds was recalled for the VB series against Pakistan, starting on April 22 in Dubai. Michael Clarke will lead the side in Pontings absence.         
	The series consists of five one-day Internationals and one Twenty20 International and will be played in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, Cricket Australia (CA) said in a statement.         
	Brett Lee and opener Shaun Marsh, who are recuperating from injuries, have also been named in the squad, subject to fitness.         
	NSP chairman Andrew Hilditch said: The NSP fully supports the recommendation of the coaching and medical staff that Ponting, Hussey and Johnson not participate in the series so that their workload can be managed appropriately in preparation for the forthcoming ICC World Twenty20 and the Ashes. The workload of all three players has been immense since September when Australias VB Tour of India commenced. Having Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey in prime form mentally and physically for the Ashes is critical and the series against Pakistan is the only opportunity to give them an appropriate break prior to the start of a very important period.         
	Mitchell Johnson is now a key bowler in all three forms of the game for Australia and weve also taken this opportunity to provide him with a break before he commences preparation for the World Twenty20 and Ashes, Hilditch added.         
	Peter Siddle is also not part of the touring squad. An extensive programme has been mapped out for Peter in preparation for potential selection for the World Twenty20 and the Ashes. He is seen as a potentially key member of our squad in our defence of the Ashes, he clarified.         
	Talking about Andrew Symonds, Hilditch said: Symonds has been cleared by Cricket Australia to resume playing for the Australian cricket team and he has been included in the squad. At his best, Andrew is a dynamic one-day player with an outstanding record for Australia. It will now be up to him to seize this opportunity.         
	The squad         
	Michael Clarke (captain), Brad Haddin (wicketkeeper), Nathan Bracken, Callum Ferguson, Brett Geeves, Nathan Hauritz, Ben Hilfenhaus, James Hopes, David Hussey, Ben Laughlin, Brett Lee (subject to fitness), Shaun Marsh (subject to fitness), Andrew Symonds, Shane Watson.

                                                   Drama again at trent bridge
                      
	There was no walkout on Tuesday, at Trent Bridge, but there was drama in plenty during India captain Mahendra Singh Dhonis press conference. Also present were manager V. Chamundeshwaranath and media manager Anirudh Choudhary.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Media: Theres a question on Sehwags injury         
	Media manager: As the captain has said, the BCCI will send a media release on the issue.         
	Media: Question is for Dhoni, please dont interfere!         
	Dhoni: Whatever is related to fitness, you will get it from the BCCI. We will inform the BCCI and through proper channel.         
	Media: Are you not aware of the fitness of your players?         
	Dhoni: I am.         
	Media: Who is leaking the news then?         
	Dhoni: I am not, that is for sure. All the guys are here. If you are blaming me, then why dont one of you stand and         
	Media: But somebody must be leaking the news         
	Dhoni: No, you just blamed me for leaking the news!         
	Media: Were not blaming you         
	Dhoni: But you just said that.         
	Media: We want clarity and honesty from the team management         
	Manager: What do you want, tell me? See if Sehwag has a pain in the hand, he might not bat... If he is comfortable he will bat at nets. Today he tried, he felt some discomfort. Tomorrow we will take a final decision on him. If he is not fit enough, we will inform the BCCI, and then the BCCI will issue a press release. Its not possible for Dhoni to say how much pain Sehwag is having!         
	Media: You could have clarified this at the start, isnt it?         
	Manager: That is what I am saying.         
	Media: MSD, the journalist hasnt blamed you for the leak         
	Dhoni: He just did that.           A CORRESPONDENT IN NOTTINGHAM

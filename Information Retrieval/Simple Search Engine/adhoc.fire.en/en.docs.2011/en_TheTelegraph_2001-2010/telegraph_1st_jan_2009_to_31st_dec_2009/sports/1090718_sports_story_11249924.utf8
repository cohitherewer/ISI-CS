The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | WI players retainership suspended
                                                   WI players retainership suspended
                      
	St Johns: The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB), taking a tough stand against the rebel players, on Friday suspended the retainership of the cricketers who boycotted the first Test against Bangladesh.         
	The players later also boycotted the official ticket launch of next years World Twenty20 in St Lucia.         
	The WICB, in its first written communication to the rebel players since the dispute cropped up, asked them to explain within 10 days why they breached the Rule 6 of their contract.         
	Each letter sent to the players read in accordance with Section 3, Rule 2.1(e) of the Code of Conduct, that they are required to submit a response within 10 days, a WICB release said.         
	The WICB suspended (the cricketers) immediately Until such time as you indicate in writing to the WICB your resumption of obligations under the contract, the release added.         
	Meanwhile, the International Cricket Council (ICC) will offer its help to broker peace between the WICB and its protesting players because the ICC wants them to field their strongest side in this years Champions Trophy.         
	The ICC general manager Dave Richardson conceded that the governing body was worried with the stalemate and said they would soon contact the WICB to offer help.         
	The ICC is concerned. We will be contacting them soon and ask them if we could offer any help, Richardson told a cricket website.         
	Certainly, if the West Indies (board) does not sort out their relationship with their players, it is a concern because we need a strong West Indies team coming to the Champions Trophy, he added.

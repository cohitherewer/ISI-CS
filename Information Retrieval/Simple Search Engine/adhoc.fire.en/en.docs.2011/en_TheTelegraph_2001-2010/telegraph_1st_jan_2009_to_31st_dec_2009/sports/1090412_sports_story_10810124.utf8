The 1,200m Black Dog Trophy also produced an equally sizzling contest between the two strongly fancied contenders, Spirituall and Red Romeo. Red Romeo tried to win from the start only to lose the advantage in his last stride. The horse is learnt to have burst a blood vessel.          
	The incident packed afternoon also witnessed the fall of two jockeys  C. Rajendra and S. N. Chavan  during the course of running the 1,000m Romanov Red Chase Your Passion Trophy, which was claimed by a rank outsider, Smokin Aces  a Sandip Mangalorkar-trained horse.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Villa rally to a draw
                                                   Villa rally to a draw
                      
	London: Gareth Barry salvaged a 3-3 draw for Aston Villa against Everton on Sunday, equalising from the penalty spot to keep the team fifth in the Premier League.         
	Referee Howard Webb awarded the 66th-minute penalty after Joleon Lescotts boot inadvertently caught Stilian Petrovs face while acrobatically trying to clear the ball.         
	Also, Clint Dempsey scored twice as Fulham rallied to beat Manchester City 3-1, keeping the London club in contention for European qualification.         
	Everton, which is nine points ahead of Fulham in sixth place, twice threw away two-goal leads at Villa Park, squandering a chance to move ahead of the home side into fifth.         
	Marouane Fellaini and Tim Cahill had put the visitors in control with goals in the first 23 minutes. John Carew pulled one back for Villa in the 33rd. Pienaar restored Evertons two-goal cushion in the 53rd, turning past Luke Young and curling a 20-metre shot past Friedel into the corner of the net.         
	Two minutes later, James Milner bent a free kick inside Tim Howards post to make it 3-2. (AP)

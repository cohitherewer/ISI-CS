The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India enter Asia Cup semi-final
                                                                                                                                   India enter Asia Cup semi-final
                      
	Bangkok: India stormed into the semi-finals of the seventh womens Asia Cup hockey tournament after holding Malaysia to a 1-1 draw in their last Group A match at the Queen Sikirt Sports Centre here Wednesday.         
	Defender Binita Toppo scored the equaliser in the 27th minute after Juliani Mohamad Din surprised India as early as in the fourth minute of the match.         
	With two wins and as many draws, India finished their group proceedings at the second spot and will take on formidable South Korea  Group B toppers  in the semi-finals.         
	China topped Group A and will face Japan in the last four stage. Earlier, undefeated Korea thrashed hapless Chinese Taipei 15-0 to register their fourth successive win and top Group B ahead of Japan.         
	Even though going into the match, they needed just a draw to progress to the semi-finals, India would be disappointed to have split points with the Malaysians.         
	The draw denied India a relatively easy semi-final outing against off-colour Japan as they needed an outright win to top Group A. (PTI)

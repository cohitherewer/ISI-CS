                                                                                                                                   Battle for top spot
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: After missing out on the No. 1 spot in the ODI team rankings, losing 2-4 in the home series against Australia, India have a chance to move to the top of the Test rankings, provided they beat Sri Lanka 2-0 or better in the three-match series which gets under way from Monday.         
	However, the Lankans also have a chance to claim the top spot. Kumar Sangakkara and his men simply need to win the series to climb to the top of the table.

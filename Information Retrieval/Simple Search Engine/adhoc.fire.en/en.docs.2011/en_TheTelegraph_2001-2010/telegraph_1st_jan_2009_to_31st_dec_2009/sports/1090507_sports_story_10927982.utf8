                                                     Royals seek revenge
          
	Pretoria: A buoyant Rajasthan Royals will look to set the record straight against the Royal Challengers Bangalore, the side that had humbled them in their opening match, in the Indian Premier League here Thursday.         
	The defending champions, who were bundled out for a lowly 58 by the Royal Challengers on the day the high-profile event kicked off, have since recovered with emphatic wins over the Deccan Chargers and the Kings XI Punjab following a roller-coaster run of alternating wins and losses till last week.         
	The Shane Warne-led outfit have climbed to third after handing a 78-run defeat to the Kings XI and they would have to make it three in a row so that their hopes of qualifying for the semi-finals are not dented.         
	The Royals seem to be peaking at the right time with their formbook boasting of a revived Graeme Smith, who hit a timely 77 Tuesday. Greenhorns Naman Ojha (68 runs) and Amit Singh (3/9) also lived up to captain-coach Warnes expectation with their shining performances with bat and ball in the win over the Kings XI.         
	Twenty20 World Cup-bound Ravindra Jadeja (33) also showed glimpses of what he is capable of after last years hero  opener Swapnil Asnodkar  failed to click on the South African pitches.         
	The team would be eagerly awaiting their Australian recruit Shane Watson, who was the man of the tournament in the inaugural edition, to boost their prospects in the coming matches. Watson is on national duty against Pakistan in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.         
	Besides, the fans would be waiting to see what surprises Warne has to offer against the resurgent Royal Challengers who have bounced back under Anil Kumble.         
	The Vijay Mallya-owned team has emerged as a force to reckon with, remaining unbeaten in their last three matches. The performance is all the more creditable as their most expensive player Kevin Pietersen has left the team to join the national squad for a teo-Test match series against the West Indies.         
	The Royal Challengers, placed fifth with four wins and four losses from eight matches, are vying for a place in the last four.

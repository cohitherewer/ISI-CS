                                                     John: Focus is on batting
            A STAFF REPORTER            Sourav Ganguly with Mohammed Azharuddins son Ashaduddin at the Eden on Monday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Kolkata Knight Riders will aim to utilise the experience gained from the inaugural edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) to achieve success in the second edition.         
	Talking to a group of journalists, Kolkata Knight Riders advisor in-charge John Buchanan revealed his plans for the upcoming season. Our plan is to learn from the mistakes of last season We have seen a little more of 20-over cricket, and certainly more domestic cricket. We could come to know what it takes to be successful here in India, Buchanan said while addressing the media at the Eden after Day I of the three-day selection trials on Monday.         
	Clearly content with the quality of the players who have assembled for the trials, the lanky Australian went on to say, I am quite impressed with the quality of the players in the camp now Next two days will give us more of an idea about the quality of the players We are looking to run a couple of matches tomorrow and in game scenario to get to know their application and skill level.         
	Talking more about his plans, Buchanan said his teams main aim was to develop domestic talent through players selected at three levels so that replacements would be ready.         
	The idea is to develop a pathway for players. Below that we would have a next level  a level II  the guys who either have played for their state or possibly have not. We believe within a year or so they can be part of the actual side. And below that, we would like to see our development players. They are potential 13, 14, 15, 16-year-old kids. Our job will be to nurture them, work with their coaches and the state association to give them a pathway to the Knight Riders.         
	Confirming that the Knight Riders have already roped in New South Wales allrounder Moises Henriques, Buchanan said that they are now eyeing England veteran Adam Hollioake.         
	I have had discussions with Hollioake. I see that he has a real role in the franchise, Buchanan said.         
	According to the former Australia coach, the batting-order in the last season was a problem and this season the focus will be on not repeating it.         
	There is no doubt that our top-order batting was a problem for us (last season). Virtually in every game, within the first six overs we lost two-three wickets. Its very much in our thinking that our top-order has to be as strong as it can be. While we may lose one or two international players we have to have our bench strength ready with Indian players, Buchanan said.         
	Obviously, we are looking at the best possible blend. Last year, (Chris) Gayle, (Brendon) McCullum, (Ricky) Ponting, (David) Hussey were important parts of the top-order. We talked already about Hollioke. We have already roped in Henriques. So there is a blend of allrounders. But in the end, we want a strong blend with Indian players. We are seeking Indian top-order players, allrounders, then of course, strike bowlers.         
	Impressed by former India captain Mohammed Azharuddins son Mohammed Ashaduddin, Buchanan said: He is still young. He has to learn a lot and has far to go But I am impressed with him He belongs to a rare pedigree.         
	Despite Ashaduddins pedigree, it will come as a surprise if he makes it.         
	Meanwhile, Buchanan when asked about the Knight Riders policy on pacer Shaoib Akhtar, said: Shoaib is up for trade... We cannot have room for two pacers. In fact, I will think about Shoaib many, many times. At the moment, he is up for trading. When he came here for a brief period he certainly made an impact as a bowler and as a player... that means that he is a potential good bowler, good try in 20-over cricket.         
	However, at this stage, we have got to let him go, and I really dont see any room for two pacers in our line-up. Therefore, we opted to place Shoaib in the trading list at this stage. Lets wait and see what happens next.         
	Many players are being put on sale by their respective franchises with the trading window closing on January 22. According to sources, Riders are keen to rope in Manoj Tiwary, who played for Delhi DareDevils last season.

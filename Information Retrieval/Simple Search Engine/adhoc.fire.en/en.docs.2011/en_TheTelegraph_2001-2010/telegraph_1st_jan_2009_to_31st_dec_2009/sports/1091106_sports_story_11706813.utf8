            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mahindra United will be keen to buck the winless trend when they take on Viva Kerala in a seventh round match of the I-League on Friday.         
	Mahindra, third in the standings with 10 points, have, of late, got into the habit of dropping points in matches they should win, and, ominously, failed to score for the first time in the season away to JCT earlier this week.         
	Coach David Booth summed it up for his boys: As long we continue in the same vein, we will win games. We just need that bit of a professional attitude to finish teams off. We are making chances but we are also missing chances.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lack of fifth bowler a worry, says Dighe
                                                     Lack of fifth bowler a worry, says Dighe
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Manoj Tiwary                           
	Calcutta/Cuttack: East Zone coach Samir Dighe expressed concern over his sides bowling after reaching the Deodhar Trophy final, defeating Central by 18 runs in Cuttack on Monday.         
	Coach Dighe feels the fifth bowler option will be something to worry about when they take on eight-time champions West in the final at the Barabati Stadium on Wednesday. We dont have a good back-up bowler. The fifth bowler option is something to worry about. We missed a fifth bowler and thus Manoj (Tiwary) had to bowl the full quota, Dighe said after their victory at the Ravenshaw University Ground.         
	East allowed the Central Zone tail to wag despite reducing the defending champions to 69 for six at one stage. Centrals Piyush Chawla, batting at No.8, bludgeoned a 96-ball 93 to take the game down to the wire.         
	Dighe, a former India wicketkeeper, picked Manoj Tiwarys youthful captaincy for special praise.         
	Right from day one, if you look, we are playing as a unit. Manoj has made it clear right from the beginning that we have to play as a team. It is paying dividends as we all are backing each other quite well.         
	Today, the strategy, after we were asked to bat, was to see through the initial overs and keep wickets in hand. With a greenish tinge, it looked a seaming track but after the openers gave a good start yet again, we took the initiative... Even the wicket prospered, added Dighe.         
	East Zone captain Tiwary lauded his teams all-round performance. The team played superbly. The boys did a commendable job in restricting Central below 250, he said.         
	We performed well in all departments of the game which is so important in a limited overs match. If we can perform similarly in the final, I dont see any reason why we cant beat West.         
	Speaking on West Zone, the stylish right-hand batsman from Bengal said: They are a strong side no doubt, but we are confident too. In a one-day match, it all depends on the particular day. So we are in with a chance.         
	They have a strong batting line-up. But you need just one ball to get rid of a batsman. We too have good batsmen. Wriddhiman (Saha), Natraj are all in good form.         
	The East Zone captain is yet to fire with the bat in the tournament. But he dismissed any worries about his own form, and said: I am playing for the team and not personal records. Today also I was dismissed trying to force the pace of the game. So I am not at all worried.         
	Happy about West Zones performance after their six-wicket victory over the Zimbabwe Presidents XI, coach Debu Mitra said: Its good to see our team restrict Zimbabwe to 176 runs. We are happy with our progress.         
	The West Zone coach said that his only concern was the slowness of the Barabati track.         
	West suffered a jolt on Monday when their strike bowler Jitendra Patil twisted his ankle in the fourth over of the innings.         
	The Maharashtra medium-pacer has been ruled out of the final and is going back home, West coach Mitra said.

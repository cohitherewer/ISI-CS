The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvi: Will take joint decision on Wada 
                                                   Yuvi: Will take joint decision on Wada 
                      
	New Delhi: Yuvraj Singh Saturday said he would go by the collective decision of the players on the contentious Whereabouts clause of the Wada anti-doping code.         
	Yuvraj said some of the Indian players, who are on the list of those required to furnish their whereabouts to the world governing body in advance, will meet an International Cricket Council (ICC) lawyer in Mumbai on Sunday and come to a decision.         
	Our concern is that we play 9 -10 months of continuous cricket... when we are not playing, we should be given that free time. We have a meeting tomorrow with the ICC and depending on that we will take a decision, he said.         
	Every team has their own decision, similarly we have our own. It will be a complete team decision and I would go by what the team decides. I dont have any individual opinion and even if I do I wont like to discuss it now, he added.         
	The Indian players missed the July 31 deadline to sign the anti-doping code and are awaiting a meeting between the ICC and the BCCI, also on Sunday, to get their concerns addressed.         
	According to the Whereabouts clause, all cricketers under the ICCs international testing pool should furnish in an online form their whereabouts, even during the off-season, for the next three months to facilitate effective out-of-competition testing.         
	The Indian players have reservations to this, which they feel infringes on their privacy.         
	Talking about the Flintoffs retirement from Tests, Yuvraj said he doesnt support the view that Twenty20 was forcing cricketers to retire early from Test cricket, saying the two things were not related.         
	I dont think players are retiring because they want to play more Twenty20. Flintoff is one of the best all-rounders and he has played enough cricket and it has taken a toll on his body, while Muttiah Muralidharan is a legend already. I dont see any connection between the two, Yuvraj said. (PTI)

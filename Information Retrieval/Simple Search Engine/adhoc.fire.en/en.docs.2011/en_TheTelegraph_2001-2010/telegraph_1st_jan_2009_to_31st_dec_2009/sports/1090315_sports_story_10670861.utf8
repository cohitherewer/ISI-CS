	Cuttack: The combined efforts of Ishank Jaggi, who slammed an unbeaten 110, and Dhiraj Goswami, who picked up a four wickets, set up East Zones comfortable 65-run win over 11 time champions North in a Group A one-day encounter in Deodhar Trophy tournament here on Saturday.         
	The victory not only earned East Zone a bonus point to enhance their chance for a place in the summit clash, but also shut the door on North, who now have just three points.         
	Riding on Jaggis century, East Zone put up a competitive 305 for six after being sent in to bat and then bundled out North for 240 in 49.4 overs.         
	For East Zone, medium-pacer Goswami of Assam was the wrecker-in-chief returning with four for 35.         
	North skipper Mithun Minhas (58) and opener Aakash Chopra (58) made half centuries but those were not enough to overhaul the big target.         
	Virat Kohli, who hit a match-winning unbeaten 79 on Friday, could score just 7 and his dismissal was crucial in turning the match in Easts favour.         
	Earlier, East put up a solid batting display as openers Wriddhiman Saha (84) and Natraj Behera (41) provided them with a rollicking start. The openers shared a 98-run stand. Rourkela boy Behera entertained the sparse home crowd in his 49-ball knock studded with eight boundaries.         
	Delhi leggie Chetanya Nanda drew first blood when he dismissed Behera but the 20-year-old Jaggi, who opens for Jamshedpur, took charge of the East innings from thereon.         
	Jaggi and Saha complimented each other in their 74-run partnership for the second wicket.         
	Manoj Tiwary had a good start to his stint as East Zone captaincy, but the stylish Bengal batsman failed individually lasting only four balls. Rajat Bhatia bowled him around the legs.         
	But North failed to make further inroads as the Jharkhand duo of Jaggi and Saurabh Tiwary (52) slowly took the match away.         
	Fresh from his unbeaten 159  his first List A century  against Assam in Vijay Hazare Trophy last month, Jaggi was at his sublime best. He played all kinds of shots  pulls, drives, sweeps and reverse-sweeps showcasing his skills in front of the lone selector  Raja Venkat (East)  watching the tie in an otherwise empty stadium.         
	The lanky right-hander completed his century from 95 balls with nine fours and one six. (PTI)

                                                     Big task for East Bengal 
                    Sunil Chetri                
	Panaji: Title aspirants Churchill Brothers will be looking to garner full points when they take on East Bengal on Sunday, in the 20th round of the I-League, at Nehru Stadium in Margao. Churchill know that they cannot afford to drop points at this stage as it will jeopardise their chances of winning their maiden title.         
	 East Bengal, who have 24 points from 19 matches, will miss medio Ismael Addo due to double booking, while striker Sunil Chetri is also a doubtful starter as he is nursing an ankle injury. The red and gold brigade may also be forced to leave Surkumar Singh out of the playing XI due to an injury.         
	 East Bengal goalkeeper Abhra Mondals fantastic performance under the bar saved them against Sporting Clube in their last match and it is to be seen how he performs against the likes of Odafe Okolie, Ogba Kalu and Felix on Sunday.         
	East Bengal coach Subhash Bhowmick said: It is a tough match and we need to remain cautious as Churchill are a strong side. They also have the home advantage and our boys need to play to their potential. Our first aim is to guard our goal and attack on counters.         
	Meanwhile, in Mumbai, Air India face Vasco Sports Club on Sunday. (AGENCIES)

    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  KOLKATA KNIGHT RIDERS HEAD OF CRICKET OPERATIONS REMAINS OPTIMISTIC             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                    
	East London: John Buchanan, who heads the cricket operations of the Kolkata Knight Riders, spoke to The Telegraph on Friday evening.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q Half the league matches are over and the Knights only have three points. Awfully disappointing, isnt it?         
	A Occupying the bottom of the table isnt the best position to be in... But I suppose, with all optimism, its not a totally hopeless situation... Not one person in the team has given up or will give up... Mathematically, weve still got a chance of making the semi-finals and well be fighting in every match. The best, as of now, is to try and make the last-four... With seven matches remaining, theres much cricket left in this tournament.         
	Fridays defeat notwithstanding, the team did look different on the park...         
	Our bowling and fielding was excellent... There were only a few poor deliveries and a couple of misfields... As for batting, 149 was gettable, but we havent been making the most of the first six overs... We lost two wickets (Sourav Ganguly, Chris Gayle) in the first six, cancelling out our taking two wickets in the first session... We just havent been able to capitalise on the first six overs. If you miss out there, then youre in a catch-up situation... Having said that, Brad Hodge and Morne van Wyk did bat very well.         
	Reflecting on the first seven matches, where did the Knights get it all wrong?         
	Not being able to win the battle, both while batting and bowling, in the first six overs. Thats the most critical phase in a T20 game... To talk of today (Friday), we did take two wickets in the first six overs, but ourselves lost two in our first six... Matches are getting decided on the basis of the team making fewer errors.         
	Fridays match, though, shouldve been won by the Knights...         
	Yeah, we did get ourselves into a winning position, but werent good enough.         
	Tactically, werent the Knights outsmarted in the last two matches  when Kevin Pietersen opened with a double spin attack and, then, when Sachin Tendulkar held back the fifth bowlers last over till the very end?         
	I wouldnt necessarily agree with you... Good for them for having done that, but I dont think we were outsmarted. Outplayed, perhaps...         
	Youve spoken of not giving up, but how is the team going to lift itself?         
	Look, despite the loss, I personally felt much better here... Weve got to look at the positives and draw inspiration from them... Build on the positives, like our bowling and fielding against the Mumbai Indians... Weve been dealing with the losses very well... I dont see any fragmentation, dont see cracks appearing.         
	The Knights invited negative headlines in the lead-up to this edition of the IPL. Did that affect on-field performances?         
	Not at all.         
	Not even changing the captain at the last minute?         
	But it wasnt at the last minute... Wed tried different captains at our camp, in Bloemfontein, and everybody had an idea of the way wed be moving forward.         
	Your choice for the captaincy, Brendon McCullum, is going through the leanest of patches. What will you tell him in the next one-on-one?         
	(Grins) One-on-ones cover a range of things... I guess he has to work on the basics, that needs to be done whenever batsmen arent getting runs or bowlers arent getting wickets. Brendon knows his game very well, so working on the basics should do.         
	Have you been happy with Souravs approach?         
	Absolutely... Hes been excellent and there hasnt been a problem at all Hes had a couple of good innings and a couple of not good innings, but thats the nature of T20... You cant always string together good performances.         
	Has Van Wyk been the find, so to say, for the Knights?         
	Hes done exceptionally in the two matches... (After a pause) Id like to say Ishant (Sharma) is better this year... Hes shown a big improvement... (Wriddhiman) Saha is promising... There are good signs, yes.         
	At this stage, whats the update on Gayle?         
	He could be available for Sundays match (against the Kings XI Punjab) as well... Things are still being worked out. We always knew hed have to leave (for England) after the first seven or eight matches.         
	What has made the difference for top-placed teams like the Deccan Chargers and the Delhi DareDevils (No.1 and 2 after Fridays matches)?         
	Their players have stepped up, both signings from overseas and from within India... In both categories, performances have been significant.         
	Are you, personally, under a lot of pressure?         
	Look, nobody likes to be losing all the time... I think we all are learning more about the T20 game and individuals.         
	The final one. What will be your theme at the team meeting ahead of Sundays match in Port Elizabeth?         
	While winning is important, we shouldnt get too caught up with results all the time... Of course, weve got to keep working on the areas where we arent doing well... The first six overs while batting, for example.

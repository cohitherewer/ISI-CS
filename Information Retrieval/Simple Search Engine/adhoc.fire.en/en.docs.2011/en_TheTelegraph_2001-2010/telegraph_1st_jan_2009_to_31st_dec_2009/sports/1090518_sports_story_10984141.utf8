    Port Elizabeth: Yusuf Pathan, the swashbuckling all-rounder representing the Rajasthan Royals rsquo; in the Indian Premier League (IPL), said that he is not intimidated by any of the bowlers in action in the IPL and feels any fear of the opposition will adversely affect his aggressive style of batting.
    ldquo;I love challenges and facing world class bowlers is a huge challenge for all of us. We have to be on our toes to get the better of the bowlers. After all, we are the defending champions here. If I had been afraid of them, I would not have played the game, rdquo; Yusuf told the IPL rsquo;s official website.
    Dhoni warning
    Port Elizabeth: The Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has warned his team against repeated fielding errors which he feels could cost them dear in the knock out stage. ldquo;I am quite happy to be in the semi-finals. But I must admit that we are committing the same mistakes on the field every day, rdquo; Dhoni said. ldquo;We can rsquo;t afford to miss catches and give those extra runs to the opposition. We are still in the league stage so it rsquo;s not hurting that much but it can prove to be very crucial in later games like in the semi-final and the final, rdquo; Dhoni said.
    Eden renovation
    Calcutta: HOK, the Singapore-based architectural firm who made a presentation before the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) for the renovation of Eden Gardens recently, may get the nod ahead of Burt Hill of the US. According to sources, the Kolkata Knight Riders rsquo; co-owner Jay Mehta rsquo;s association with the Singapore company may tilt the scales as Mehta enjoys a cordial relationship with the CAB brass. The matter will be decided at the stadium committee meeting on Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiwary run out crucial: Shukla
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tiwary run out crucial: Shukla
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Bengal team posted their lowest total this season and one could gauge the disappointment in skipper Laxmi Ratan Shuklas voice.         
	As far as I am concerned, a total of 193 is simply unacceptable. It is a very poor score and now it will require a Herculean effort to come back into the match, Shukla said.         
	Although there was a fair bit of grass on the Green Park strip, the Bengal skipper feels that it was just a matter of seeing through the first hour.         
	We let their bowlers dominate during the first hour. It was poor application on the part of our batsmen.         
	I dont want to point fingers at anyone but it was collective failure. If you lose three wickets in the first hour, you will obviously be on the backfoot, Shukla said.         
	He however praised Sourav Gangulys efforts. Sourav showed that there was no devil in the wicket. His batting was an example for all of us.         
	Coming back after two matches, Shukla scored 39 and looked in good touch before a delivery from RP Singh came back sharply to bowl him through the gate.         
	That was a sharp inswinger. One of the best deliveries of the day, he said.         
	I was middling the ball well. If I got support from the other end, may be we could have put up a few more runs on the board.         
	I had to refuse at least 10 singles as I wanted to protect the tail-enders. Each run counts in the long run, Shukla lamented.         
	Shukla admitted that Manoj Tiwarys run-out was one of the turning points of the match. Manoj was our in-form batsman.         
	Whenever Manoj scores big, we are assured that we will be successful in putting up a challenging score on the board.         
	His manner of dismissal was the most unfortunate and really pegged us back.

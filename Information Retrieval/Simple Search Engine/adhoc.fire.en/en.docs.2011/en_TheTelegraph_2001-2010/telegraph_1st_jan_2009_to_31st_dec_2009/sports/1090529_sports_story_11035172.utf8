The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team India have best balance, says Kumble
                                                     Team India have best balance, says Kumble
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Anil Kumble in Mumbai on Thursday. (PTI)                           
	Mumbai: Former India captain Anil Kumble, who led the Royal Challengers Bangalore to the final of second edition of the Indian Premier League, believed that the Indian team would not let factors like complacency or fatigue to derail their chances of defending the World T20 Cup title.         
	I think we are the best balanced side. If we play to our potential, we can come back with a win, the countrys all-time leading wicket-taker in Tests said at the launch of Castrol cricket Index.         
	I dont think they will be complacent. They have realised the dangers of complacency  It is up to the players to ensure that their body and mind is in the best frame.         
	Its not only India who play non-stop cricket, every team do that. And none can complain. It was known couple of years ago that there would be just a weeks gap between the IPL and the World Championship. Its planned before.         
	I dont think Viru (Virender Sehwag) will be affected (by fatigue). He came back strongly in the IPL  Gautam (Gambhir) is the kind of player who will do well in England. Both are explosive openers.         
	Kumble also cautioned against rushing pace spearhead Zaheer Khan back into the national squad for the World T20 before the bowler had fully recovered from a shoulder injury.         
	Zaheer has led our attack exceptionally well and if he needs more time to be fit, then he should be given time. Thats the way it should go, Kumble said on the sidelines of a promotional event here.         
	The left-arm pacer had injured his shoulder during the Indian Premier League and stayed back in South Africa after the tournament for further treatment, fuelling speculation that he might be ruled out of the World T20 event to be held in England from June 5.         
	Kumble played down his success as skipper of the Royal Challengers, who struggled initially under the leadership of Kevin Pietersen before the 38-year-old veteran turned it around for them. Its not rocket science  the victory against the Kolkata Knight Riders really helped. That was the turning point, he said.         
	But Kumbles tone turned sharp when a reporter pointed out that both the winning captains of the two editions of IPL were Australians. That way we can have an Australian leading the Indian team  I think its just a coincidence.         
	He was also optimistic about the survival of Test cricket in the wake of onslaught of the immensely popular Twenty20 cricket and its most potent brand  the IPL.         
	I dont know what exactly did Chris Gayle say in England. I just read reports and dont think he said Test cricket will die, Kumble said.         
	As far as I am concerned, Test cricket is the ultimate and I looked up to the Test players in my early days and wanted to play Tests. Twenty20 cricket is hugely popular now with 12-13-year-olds. I think Test cricket, and in fact all the three formats, will survive, he said at a promotional event.         
	He was also of the opinion that the Umpires Decision Review System (UDRS) would ultimately be of help to the umpires and players but wanted the International Cricket Council (ICC) to sort out a few technical issues prior to introducing it in all matches.         
	There are still a couple of technical issues (to be sorted out) and it should be tried out in the one-day format too. Once that happens, it will help the umpires and the players, said the retired leg spin ace here on Thursday.

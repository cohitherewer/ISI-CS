The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Must-win tie for Bagan
                                                                                                                       7                                      Must-win tie for Bagan
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Guwahati: Defending champions Mohun Bagan will meet Mahindra United in a do-or-die battle for a berth in the semi-finals of the ongoing Hero Honda 31st Federation Cup football tournament, at Nehru Stadium here Saturday evening.         
	Mahindra, who are leading the group B tally with six points from two wins, enjoy a slight edge over the Calcutta outfit who have beaten Mohammedan Sporting 4-1 in their first match but were held to a goalless draw by Chirag United in the next. Bagan, thus, have garnered four points so far.         
	So, while Bagan would need to win stay in the tournament, a draw will be enough for Mumbais Mahindra to see them through.         
	Bagan are also going to miss the services of key midfielder Snehashish Chakraborty who is recuperating from an elbow injury sustained against Chirag on Wednesday.         
	Last years runners-up Dempo are already out of the contention. However, the break Friday must have given both the teams the much-needed breather and time to redraw their strategies ahead of the much-awaited tie.         
	Chirag will meet Mohammedan Sporting in an inconsequential group B match that will precede the Bagan-Mahindra tie.         
	In Silchar, Mumbai FC will meet Hindustan Aeronauticals Ltd, Bangalore while Churchill Brothers clash with Sporting Clube de Goa in two group C matches Saturday. Churchill are leading the group with six points, winning against HAL (3-0) and Mumbai FC (1-0) in their two matches so far.

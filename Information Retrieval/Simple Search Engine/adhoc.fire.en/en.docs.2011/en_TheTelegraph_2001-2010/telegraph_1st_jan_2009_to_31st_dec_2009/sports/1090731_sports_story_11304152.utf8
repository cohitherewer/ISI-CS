	Dambulla: Seamers Thilan Thushara and Nuwan Kulasekera ripped through Pakistans top order as Sri Lanka won the first one-day International cricket match by 36 runs here on Thursday.         
	Left-armer Thushara finished with three for 29 and Kulasekera took two for 30 as Pakistan struggled against Sri Lankas 232 for nine and were bowled out for 196 in 44.4 overs at the Rangiri International Stadium.         
	The tourists slipped to 134 for eight before tailenders Umar Gul and Mohammed Amir boosted the total with a rollicking ninth-wicket stand of 62 runs. Gul top-scored for Pakistan with 33 off 21 balls, including four boundaries in one over from fast bowler Lasith Malinga. Teenager Amir made 23.         
	The pair took the total to 196 for eight when both batsmen fell in the space of two deliveries to hand Sri Lanka the lead in the five-match series.         
	Amir was run out by a direct throw from Mahela Jayawardene, before Gul was bowled by Malinga next ball.         
	Earlier, Sri Lanka recovered from their own top order failure to post a competitive 232 for nine.         
	All-rounder Angelo Mathews (43) led the late revival, with the last four Sri Lankan wickets adding 101 valuable runs before the 50 overs ran out.         
	Muttiah Muralidharan, who missed the preceding Test series with a knee injury, marked his return with an aggressive 32 off 15 balls that included four boundaries and a six. (AFP)

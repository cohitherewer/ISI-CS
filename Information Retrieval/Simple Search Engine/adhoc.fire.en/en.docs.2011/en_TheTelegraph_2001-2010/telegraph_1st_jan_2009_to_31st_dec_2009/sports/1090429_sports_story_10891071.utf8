                                                     Yuki: Focus on mens events
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Yuki Bhambri                           
	Mumbai: Yuki Bhambri says Grand Slam junior championships dont matter much to him anymore as he has set his sights on the mens circuit.         
	The Australian Open boys champion, who won his maiden ITF Futures title in Delhi on April 25, has chalked out a hard court oriented plan in the lead up to the French Open, played on clay. Bhambri himself is least perturbed about the shift, arguing that he doesnt have much to prove at the junior level.         
	My focus is now on the mens events. I have proved myself by winning the Australian Open title. Once you have won a Grand Slam, it (the junior circuit) doesnt matter much, the 16-year-old sensation told The Telegraph over phone.         
	Bhambri will be playing two hard court mens events in Kuwait in the latter half of May before the junior championships at Roland Garros in the first week of June.         
	The Delhi lad became the youngest Indian to win a Futures title at 16 years 9 months and 21 days, but the news got drowned in the hue and cry over Australias forfeiture of the Davis Cup tie against India next month.         
	The record was previously held by another Delhiite, Sanam Singh, who was 23 days from 17 when he won his first Futures title at the same venue. But the record was not on Yukis mind before he lifted the trophy.         
	I was aware of it (the record). I was there when Sanam won. But it wasnt really at the back of my mind. You play to win matches and if you keep winning records come your way. I was hungry enough to win that day, he said.         
	I couldnt have asked for a better start to 2009. First I won the Australian Open and now the mens title  I have proved that I can match up to them (seniors).         
	Meanwhile, Yuki started from where he left off last week as he knocked out Rohan Gajjar to move to the second round of the $15,000 ITF Futures singles event here today.         
	Yuki, who had defeated Gajjar in the quarter finals last week en route to his first mens title, once again asserted his supremacy over his compatriot by pulling off a 6-4, 7-6(7-4) victory in the first round at the DLTA complex.

                                                   Jwala-Diju script history for India
                      
	New Delhi: Jwala Gutta and V. Diju Sunday became the first Indian mixed doubles pair to clinch a Grand Prix Gold title after pulling off a hard-fought win in the final of the badminton tournament in Chinese Taipei.         
	The world No. 7 Indian pair prevailed 24-22, 21-18 over the Indonesian duo of Hendra Aprida Gunawan and Vita Marissa to achieve the historic feat in Taipei.         
	In the first game, the Indian pair opened up a 15-9 lead but the Indonesian combo staged a comeback to reduce the gap to 15-14. But Jwala and Diju quickly got their act together and prevailed in long rallies to go one up.         
	The Indonesians started off well in the second game and were leading at 13-9 but this time it was the turn of the Indians to claw back and make it 15-15.         
	Jwala and Diju then grabbed the lead and sealed the issue in their favour.         
	It is a great feeling. I am extremely happy but to be honest, I still cant believe that we have won. The feeling is yet to sink in. Our team has already left and we are all alone here, Jwala said.         
	May be after we go back home, we will realise that we have won, added Jwala, who is turning 26 on September 7.         
	It wasnt an easy match. It was a quality match and there were long rallies and we didnt give away any silly point. We had to work hard for it.         
	Jwala-Diju had become the first Indian mixed doubles pair to reach the quarter finals of the World Badminton Championship in Hyderabad earlier this month.           (AGENCIES)

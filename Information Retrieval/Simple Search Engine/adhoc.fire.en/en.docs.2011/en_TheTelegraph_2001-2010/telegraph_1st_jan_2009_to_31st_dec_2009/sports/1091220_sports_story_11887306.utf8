The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Panel reduced to a farce
                                                                                                                       7                                      Panel reduced to a farce
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The cricket development committee (CDC) of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) has become a one-member committee.         
	CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya had announced the formation of the CDC during the first working committee meeting after the AGM in July.         
	Sourav Ganguly was named the chairman, while former Bengal captains  Arun Lal, Pranab Roy and Ashok Malhotra  were the other members. Dalmiya had said that the committee would review the Ranji Trophy season and give their inputs, apart from charting out a blueprint for the development of the game.         
	Bengals Ranji season ended on Friday and the only person, among the committee members, in a position to analyse and review Bengals performance is Sourav.         
	Among the other three, Malhotra and Lal were not present in any of Bengals matches, while Roy dropped in for a couple of days during the matches at Eden Gardens.         
	Whether it was lack of communication on CABs part or the trios part is not clear, but the CDC has been reduced to a farce. Now, the CAB is relying on Sourav for a proper review of the Ranji season as the others cannot give a first-hand account of Bengals show.         
	Well have to take a detailed report from Sourav and seek his advice on the things to be done. He is the only one abreast with the happenings. Once Sourav comes back from his vacation (in the UK), well request him to submit a report, a senior office-bearer said on Saturday.         
	When Arun Lal and Pronab Roy were contacted by The Telegraph, the former said: We had a brief but thats all I can tell you. Told that questions are being asked in the CAB corridors as to why he has not watched a single match, Lal refused comment.         
	Roy said they were not briefed about watching matches.         
	Watching matches is selectors job. Ill go and watch matches if I feel that is required. Its my prerogative. Besides, our job is not only preparing a review of the Ranji performance but also suggesting ways of improving the standard of cricket in the state, Roy remarked.         
	The CAB brass always knew that Lal and Malhotra, who have some media commitments, will not be able to give much time to the CDC, yet they did not opt for someone with a sound knowledge of the game, who could have helped Sourav in preparing the review.         
	As things stand, Sourav, who bailed out Bengal with the bat a number of times during season, will have to bail the CAB out with a pen and paper.

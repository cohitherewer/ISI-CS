The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahindra, JCT play out a dull draw
                                                   Mahindra, JCT play out a dull draw
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mahindra Uniteds goal drought continued as they played out a 0-0 draw against JCT in a 15th round I-League match here Saturday.         
	It was a drab affair at the Cooperage as neither team showed any inspiration to produce a goal, which was all the more surprising since both had made loud noises about the importance of securing full points.         
	Air India, Mahindra and JCT are respectively teams seventh, eighth and ninth on the I-League table  all have 17 points each but are separated by goal-difference.         
	The visitors might be happy to walk away with a point, but home coach Derrick Pereira would be a worried man  except for Douhou Pierre, none of the Mahindra forwards displayed the skill or the hunger to find the target.         
	Pereira had to field Amit Nandy under the bar as a back spasm kept first choice custodian Subhasish Chowdhury out. Chidi Edeh, who started on the bench, had to come on early after K.N. Vijayan, wearing the captains armband, suffered a calf muscle injury in the 34th minute.         
	Mahindra though were unlucky to have a goal ruled off-side when Chidi made a reverse strike to beat Nandy in the 58th minute.         
	Yet, Pereira would rue the couple of clean chances that his strikers failed to convert.         
	The first one came in the 13th minute when Sushil Kumar Singh, failed to connect with a Steven Dias cross.         
	Again, immediately after resumption, Chidi, receiving one of the many brilliant passes from Douhou, failed to beat the keeper in front of the box.         
	Mahindra were touted as one of the best I-League teams at the start of the season but they have not been able to live up to the billing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Matt Priors burst gives the hosts a huge lead
                                                   Matt Priors burst gives the hosts a huge lead
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	London: England edged closer to their first win over Australia at Lords in 75 years, taking a 521-run lead on the third day of the second Ashes Test Saturday.         
	The hosts, seeking to regain the Ashes, made 311 for six in their second innings before rain stopped play. Captain Andrew Strauss had earlier opted not to enforce the follow-on when Australia were dismissed for 215 before lunch in reply to Englands 425.         
	Matt Prior scored 61 from 42 deliveries to help England push on toward setting Australia a target. Prior added 86 from 74 balls with Paul Collingwood (54), after Kevin Pietersen and Ravi Bopara had laboured.         
	Prior was run out by a direct hit from Marcus North on the boundary. Andrew Flintoff then scored 30 not out to take Englands lead past 500.         
	With two days left, Australia need to better the world-record 418 that the West Indies made against them in 2003.         
	Flintoffs stay at the crease so far has been a treat to watch. He has hit four boundaries and has looked to attack all the time.         
	England were 57 without loss at lunch but Australia removed the openers in the second and fourth overs following the interval, bowled by off-spinner Nathan Hauritz.         
	Alastair Cook went back to a ball he should have been forward to and was lbw to Hauritz for 32. Then Strauss, who made 161 in the first innings, edged a turning ball to Michael Clarke at slip for the same score.         
	Englands progress towards a declaration slowed dramatically after the openers were dismissed in successive overs from Hauritz. Cook and Strauss had been motoring along nicely during the morning session, taking advantage of more free gifts from the out-of-sorts Mitchell Johnson.         
	Strangely, though, Hauritz bowled only four more balls in the session. Pietersen came down the pitch to the third of them, and slammed it over mid-on for four.         
	It was a misleading start to Pietersens innings, for after that he added only 24 more runs off 70 balls. He mistimed the majority of his strokes, to the point where Nasser Hussain, speaking on television, suggested that this is the worst he has ever seen Pietersen play.         
	England might have crashed from 61/0 to 88/4 had Australia grabbed their opportunities. Pietersen survived an lbw appeal on 10 to Ben Hilfenhaus. As Pietersen looked anxiously towards the umpire, he wandered down the pitch and Ricky Ponting tried to run him out from slip, but missed the stumps. He would have been out by three feet.         
	Three balls later, Bopara, on nine, edged a probing delivery from Peter Siddle on off stump to Ponting at second slip, which he dropped at shin height. It was a painful time for Ponting as the drop was replayed on the big screen several times.         
	This was one of those slow, looping edges that you expect to be swallowed without a hitch. But perhaps Ponting was surprised by the very lack of pace, because he pointed his fingers up  as if the ball was going to carry to him easily  before realising that it was dying in the final yards of its flight.         
	Bopara, when unbeaten on 19, was almost caught in the over before tea after pulling Johnson to Hauritz at mid-on. Bopara stood his ground and the third umpire ruled not out following inconclusive TV replays.         
	Bopara eventually prodded an off-spinner from Hauritz to Simon Katich at short leg. He made 27 from 93 balls. Pietersen, who limped some of his runs having suffered recently with an Achilles tendon injury, was caught behind off an inside edge to Siddle for 44 from 101.         
	At the start of the day, Australias tail-enders almost reached the follow-on target of 226 through Siddle (35) and Hauritz (24), who combined in a ninth-wicket stand of 44.         
	Hauritz eventually edged Graham Onions to Collingwood at third slip to end his 57-minute innings. Siddle was the last man out for a Test best score, edging Onions to Strauss to first slip.

                                                   Freddie powers hosts to historic victory 
            TIMES ONLINE AND AGENCIES                      
	London: Andrew Flintoff led England off the field after helping his side to wrap up the second Test at Lords some 15 minutes before lunch. Bowling flat out in a ten-over spell, he claimed the third five-wicket haul of his Test career on the way to a first Ashes success at the ground since 1934.         
	Australia began the day still 209 short of what would have been a record first-innings chase of 522 to win, but the loss of Brad Haddin to Flintoffs fourth ball, ending a stand of 185 with Michael Clarke, effectively removed any prospect of a turnaround, no matter some late blows from Mitchell Johnson.         
	Flintoff did not look like a man struggling against a career-threatening knee injury when he struck Clarke with a ball timed at 92.9mph, but it was Graeme Swann who ended the brilliant innings of the Australia vice-captain when his flight prompted a misjudgement, Clarke on 136 playing inside one that dipped.         
	Johnson drove forcefully and slog-swept Swann, but Flintoff knocked out Nathan Hauritzs off stump and then bowled Peter Siddle before Johnson swung once too often across Swanns off-spin and lost his middle stump.         
	So, eight days after surviving by the skin of their teeth at Cardiff, England are 1-0 up in the five-match series.         
	Flintoffs five-wicket haul  he returned figures of five for 91  started with the wickets of the Australia openers Simon Katich and Phillip Hughes Sunday. It was his first at Lords.         
	Mike Atherton stressed the importance of an early wicket for England  and that is exactly what Flintoff delivered.         
	After a brilliantly hostile opening over from James Anderson, in which he peppered Clarke, the all-rounder struck with his fourth ball, turning Brad Haddin inside out and forcing an edge through to Paul Collingwood for 80.         
	Swann then got the scalp England needed most of all. A regulation off-spinner was given plenty of air and Clarke was beaten in the flight. He stood his ground in dismay for seconds after his stumps had been rattled.         
	His replacement, Hauritz, lasted only four balls as England scented victory, Flintoff rattling his off stump with a full ball.         
	The all-rounder then followed up with the wicket of Siddle with the score on 387.         
	Its been a good Test match, Flintoff, named Man of the Match, said.         
	I have got three Test matches left and I will give my all. Its going to be hard to get through them but I will be giving everything,         
	Swann completed the job with the wicket of Johnson, who was out for a brisk and defiant 63.         
	Australia resumed on their overnight total of 313 for five, requiring 209 for an unlikely triumph.         
	Clarke and Haddin put on a record sixth-wicket partnership for Australia at Lords and gave their team a glimmer of hope when all had seemed lost.         
	Australia had been outplayed, out-thought and outfought until Clarke, who scored his third Ashes hundred and his first in England, and Haddin came together at 128 for five, the game seemingly beyond them and England rampant.         
	But Test-match victories over Australia do not come cheap and, if anything, it was England who were grateful for the chance to recuperate when the umpires offered the light with 12 overs remaining in the day, the partnership worth 185.         
	We have enjoyed playing here (Lords) and have a proud record over a number of years so its disappointing to lose any Test match and especially here, Australia captain Ricky Ponting said.         
	Im proud of the way we fought the game out but since lunch on day one we have been chasing our tails. We were outplayed from the first ball.         
	One of Pontings greatest problem is the form of strike bowler Johnson, who returned figures of three for 132 from 21.4 overs in the first innings  including 24 boundaries  and none for 68 in the second innings.         
	We will go to Northampton looking to rectify a few things that have been glaringly obvious, Ponting said.         
	Weve got some issues to work through.         
	Ponting said he hoped that Johnson, too, will work to overcome his problems.         
	It was only a couple of games ago that he was bowling as well as anyone going around.         
	There was a lot of talk about Mitchell arriving here and everyone wanting to see him bowl and see him bat.         
	That was only a couple of weeks ago. Its not as if hes lost everything hes ever had.         
	Hell work hard over the next ten days to give himself the best chance to keep improving.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 500-550 is a must: Taylor
                                                   500-550 is a must: Taylor
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Napier: New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor scored a significant century on the first day of the second Test against India here Thursday and said he was happy to have made India pay for letting him off early in his innings.         
	The right-hander, whose century along with Jesse Ryders, put New Zealand in a very strong position, added that the job was only half-done and his team needs to score 500-550 to put the visitors under pressure.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	How is he feeling after the century?         
	I havent scored any significant runs for a while now and I was probably a little bit more nervous than I have been in the past. I am probably a nervous starter normally, but today (Thursday), I was a little bit more nervous. I was happy with the let-off and I made them pay.         
	On the partnership with Ryder         
	I felt okay out there and Jesse was a big help throughout that whole innings. He was egging me on. We got to give a lot of credit to Jesse.         
	On the wicket         
	We knew it was a pretty good wicket once the new ball lost its shine. We knew if we play straight, its a pretty fast-scoring ground. Not losing wickets was the key.         
	How much do New Zealand need to put India under pressure?         
	You dont often get 350 on the first day. Its something the team should be proud of. But we know that its only half the job done. We probably need around about 500-550 to be competitive. We know that it is a good wicket and that the Indian batting is very good. So hopefully we can see off the second new ball in the morning and then score in the second and third sessions.         
	If the visitors lacked intensity         
	They were pretty happy at 23 for three. I guess once you do get a partnership of over a hundred, no matter what team you play against, they always go a little bit quiet on the field. Having said that, they came back well after breaks and kept themselves going.

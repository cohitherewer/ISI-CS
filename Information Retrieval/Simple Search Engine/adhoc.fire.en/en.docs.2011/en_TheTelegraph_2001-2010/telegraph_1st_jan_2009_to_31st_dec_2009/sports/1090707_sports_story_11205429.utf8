                                                     Dravids not young, but solid
    - Shift in policy sees former captain, 36, back in ODI frame             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI    
	Calcutta: Worried by the shortcomings in technique and wanting to send a dont-take-your-place-for-granted message to some of the younger players, the senior national selectors have fallen back on the 36-year-old Rahul Dravid.         
	By listing Dravid among the 30 Team India probables for the Champions Trophy, Krishnamachari Srikkanth and his colleagues have jettisoned the go-for-youngsters policy, specific to limited overs cricket, adopted from the last year (2007-08) of Dilip Vengsarkars tenure as chief selector.         
	It may be temporary, but the shift is significant and Dravids no more to be seen as a Test specialist.         
	Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and coach Gary Kirstens views couldnt be ascertained they dont, in any case, formally come into the picture when probables are picked  but its taken for granted that Dravid will make the final 15 for the tournament in South Africa.         
	The Champions Trophy will be held there between September 24-October 5.         
	Dravid hasnt, in fact, featured in an ODI squad after the September-October 2007 series at home against Australia. The former captains CV, though, is awesome: 10, 585 runs (12x100, 81x50) in 333 appearances.         
	More important, few batsmen anywhere score higher on technique. Fewer still, incidentally, have 10,000-plus runs in both Tests and ODIs.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Dravids fine showing in the shortest format earlier this year, in South Africa, was a factor in his recall after 21 months.         
	Dravid totalled close to 300 runs in the T20-driven IPL, often scoring in very demanding conditions for the finalists, Royal Challengers Bangalore.         
	His recall was unanimous.         
	Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina and Rohit Sharma have, at different times in the past month, been exposed technically... We need somebody at the top of the order to hold fort and help build the innings... Dravid fits that bill perfectly, is what a top source said on Monday.         
	Indeed, there has been little stability at the No.3 position, a slot always preferred by Dravid.         
	The top source added: Besides keeping the teams requirements in mind, the selectors have sent a very clear message to the younger lot  that advantage of age alone wont guarantee them a place and that they need to quickly pull up their socks...         
	Irfan Pathan got the message last month itself, when he got dropped for the four-match ODI series in the West Indies, which ended on Sunday.         
	He hasnt made this probables list either.         
	All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, one understands, came close to being omitted. So, hes under pressure.         
	Bengals Wriddhiman Saha is in the 30, but with Dhoni and Dinesh Karthik (who grabbed opportunities in the West Indies with both hands) around, he doesnt stand a realistic chance of making the 15.         
	Nevertheless, theres no harm being in a pool which includes the Sachin Tendulkars. Good to be talked about too, even if its in a small way.         
	The 2009-10 season, beginning with the Emerging meet in Australia, may turn out to be a make-or-break one for Saha.         
	Uttar Pradesh quick Bhuvneshwar Kumar Singh, meanwhile, is the only one making his debut in a Team India probables list.         
	Theres no sign yet of Sreesanth, who was an absolute certainty when the tournament was last held  at home in October-November 2006.         
	The upcoming Champions Trophy will be the biggest 50-over tournament before the 2011 World Cup.

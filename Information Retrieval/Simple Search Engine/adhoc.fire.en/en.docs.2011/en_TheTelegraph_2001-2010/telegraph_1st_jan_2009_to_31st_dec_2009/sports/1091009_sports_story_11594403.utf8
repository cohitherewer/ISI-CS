The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Difficult times, admits Bencharifa 
                                                   Difficult times, admits Bencharifa 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Oh! That sinking feeling once again. There must be a sense of dj vu in the Mohun Bagan camp these days. Another faltering start to the I-League  Thursdays 1-2 defeat to JCT means they have lost their first two matches  and Bagans hopes of winning the title since 2001-02 have already run into rough weather.         
	So whats Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa saying? At the post-match conference the Moroccan tried to put up a brave front and have those present believe that alls not lost yet. We are hit by injuries and suspensions but we still are a formidable squad, he said.         
	Its a difficult time for the club. For a team to prepare well, everything has to be in order. But theres an unhealthy atmosphere right now in the Calcutta Maidan. But we will definitely bounce back, he added.         
	Senior pro Deepak Mondal agreed with his coach: We have enough time. Its just a passing phase. You cant write us off after just two matches. But the onus is on us, the players, to turn the tide.

  - Manoj, deep hit half-centuries to save match; Mumbai defeat Himachal               Manoj Tiwary                           
	Mysore: Captain Manoj Tiwary led from the front with an unbeaten 65 as Bengal managed to avert an outright defeat against Karnataka in their Super League (Group B) encounter of the Ranji Trophy at the Gangotri Glades ground here on Friday.         
	At the close of play on the final day, Tiwarys innings ensured that Bengal finished at 213 for six in 86 overs after Karnataka declared their innings on their overnight total of 523 for nine.         
	At one point of time, Bengal were staring at defeat with scoreboard reading 178 for six and with more than an hours play left. Sourasish Lahiri (6 ..) hung on for 65 minutes with the stand-in-captain to ensure a point for Bengal. Bengal now have seven points from three matches and maintain their second position in group B. Hosts Karnataka maintain their top position with 11 points from three matches.         
	In the morning, it was Deep Dasgupta who came out to open the innings along with Arindam Das after team management decided to send first innings centurion Rohan Banerjee lower down the order due to an ankle injury.         
	The duo batted sedately to add 61 runs 21 overs. In the first delivery of the 22nd over, Das (31, 64 balls, 5x4) was dismissed by left-arm spinner Sunil Joshi caught by B Akhil. Dasgupta was joined by Avishek Jhunjhunwala (17) and the pair took the team to 94 before Jhunjhunwala was caught by R. Vinay Kumar off B Akhils bowling.         
	Dasgupta completed his second half-century of the season (he scored a half-century against Maharashtra in Pune). He batted for close to four hours before he was the third Bengal wicket to fall at 113. The former Bengal captain was run out for 55 off 127 deliveries with six boundaries to his credit.         
	Wicket-keeper batsman Wriddhiman Saha (14) and all-rounder Sayan Sekhar Mondal (11) departed with the team total at 142 and 160 respectively. Saha was caught by keeper C.M. Gautam off leg-break bowler Amit Verma. Mondal playing his second first-class match was also caught by Gautam off Vinay Kumar.         
	Injured Banerjee finally came out to bat No 7 with runner Jhunjhunwala. He was trapped leg before off Vinay Kumar for 3.         
	Tiwary, however, batted for more than four hours to save his team from the blushes.

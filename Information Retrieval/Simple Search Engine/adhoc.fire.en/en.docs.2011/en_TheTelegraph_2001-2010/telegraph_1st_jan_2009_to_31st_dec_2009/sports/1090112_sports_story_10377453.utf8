The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sharath, Shamini win titles
                                                   Sharath, Shamini win titles
                      
	Patna: Olympian Achanta Sharath Kamal retained the mens singles title for the Maharaja Pithapuram Cup while top seed K. Shamini lifted the Travancore Cup by winning the womens singles competition in the 70th Senior National Table Tennis Championship at the Secretariat Indoor Hall, Sunday.         
	Former national champion Bengals Mouma Das went down to PSPBs Shamini 2-4 in a keenly-contested final, while top seed and Indias No. 1 paddler, Sharath, trounced unseeded Pathik Mehta 4-1.         
	Mouma, who earlier clinched the womens doubles title pairing up with statemate former national champion Poulomi Ghatak, scripted a brilliant comeback during the fourth game of the singles final after Shamini bagged the first three games 11-8, 11-8, 11-6.         
	Although Mouma recaptured her touch late in the match to clinch the next two games at 11-8 each, her effort was clearly not enough to disrupt the rhythm of the Chennai girl, who clinched her maiden national crown by winning a thrilling fifth set 13-11.         
	Sharath, who spanked Sourav Chakraborty of the RSPB 4-1 in the last-four stage, didnt face any problem in getting past Pathik of Gujarat en route the national title for the fourth time. After winning a close first game 12-10, the 26-year-old Sharath dominated the show to clinch the next two games 11-8, 11-4.         
	Pathik staged a fight-back winning the fourth game 11-9 but the lanky Chennai boy neutralised his threat to wrap up the match 12-10.         
	Sharath became richer by Rs 1.54 lakh while Shamini was awarded Rs one lakh.         
	In womens doubles, third-seeded pair Mouma and Poulomi stopped the winning run of unseeded Divya Deshpande and Ashlesha.         
	It was a memorable journey for Divya and Ashlesha, who knocked out top-seeded pair of Olympian Neha Aggarwal and Shamini in the semi-final.         
	Former national champion PSPBs Subhajit Saha paired up with teammate A. Amal Raj to successfully negotiate the combined effort from R. Raja and Sathiyan G. of Tamil Nadu in the mens doubles.

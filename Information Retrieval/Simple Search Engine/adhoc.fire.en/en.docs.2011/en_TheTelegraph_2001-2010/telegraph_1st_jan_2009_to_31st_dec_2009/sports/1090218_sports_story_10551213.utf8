The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shift Cup venues if necessary: ICC
                                                   Shift Cup venues if necessary: ICC
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Haroon Lorgat on Tuesday asked the 2011 World Cup organising committee to consider shifting venues if the situation in Pakistan worsens.         
	Addressing a press conference after the meeting of the organising committee here, Lorgat said: We are committed to staging a successful and world class World Cup... However, we are considering the option of alternative venues.         
	Asked whether it was possible to organise matches in Pakistan under the present circumstances, the ICC official said: This is not something we discussed today except to ask the organisers to consider alternative venues within the country, as well as in another country, in the event something is not favourable in one of the host countries.         
	Though relations between India and Pakistan has hit an all time low after the terror attacks in Mumbai last November, Pakistan Cricket Board president Ejaz Butt and CEO Saleem Altaf flew down to Delhi on Monday night to attend the meeting.         
	Also present at the meeting were ICC general manager (commercial) Campbell Jamieson, ICC principal advisor Inderjit Singh Bindra, ICC vice-president and chairman of the organising committee Sharad Pawar, Salman Butt (tournament director, World Cup 2011), Mahbubul Anam and Shafiqur Rahman (both Bangladesh Cricket Board), Lalith Wickremasinghe, Navin Marapana and Duleep Mendis (both Sri Lanka Cricket), and N. Srinivasan and Ratnakar Shetty (both BCCI).         
	Lorgat, however, refused to be dragged into any discussion on whether he expected the situation to improve in Pakistan. Im an optimistic person by nature. But at the same time, Im no crystal ball gazer, he said.         
	It is certainly a consideration to keep note of but its way too early to be already concerned at this particular stage... When we come close to the event, obviously we have to pay much more attention to issues like safety, security and relation between the countries. But I can assure you at this stage we are planning a World Cup for all four countries.         
	The final security review of the championship will be done six months prior to the start of the World Cup.         
	Lorgat said that of the 15 World Cup venues, eight would be in India, four in Pakistan, two in Sri Lanka and one in Bangladesh. The organising committee also decided that each of the four host nations will stage one quarter-final each. The semi-finals will be held in Sri Lanka and Pakistan and the final in Mumbai.         
	The opening ceremony will take place in Bangladesh on 19 February 2011.         
	The ICC chief executive said that unlike the last World Cup, the 2011 edition would be reduced to a six-week affair. Lorgat admitted the organisers were still running behind schedule and had some catch-up to do.

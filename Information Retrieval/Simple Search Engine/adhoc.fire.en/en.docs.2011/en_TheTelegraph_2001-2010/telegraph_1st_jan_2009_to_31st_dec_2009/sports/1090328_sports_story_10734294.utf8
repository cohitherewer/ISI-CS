The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand ends joint 2nd
                                                   Anand ends joint 2nd
                      
	Nice: World champion Viswanathan Anand missed chances galore in the blindfold game against Chinese Wang Yue and had to be content with an overall joint second finish in the Amber blindfold and rapid chess tournament here.         
	Anand, however, maintained his supremacy in the rapid section as he tied with Levon Aronian of Armenia and Gata Kamsky of the US.         
	The Indian ace finished with 7 points out of a possible 11 in the rapid section while in the blindfold, he finished joint fourth on 6.5 points. Aronian drew both his games against former world champion Veslein Topalov of Bulgaria in the final round and emerged as the clear winner .         
	The Armenian finished with 14 points out of a possible 22 games and remained half a point ahead of Anand and Vladimir Kramnik of Russia, both of whom shared the overall second spot.         
	Magnus Carlsen of Norway found his nemesis in the blindfold in Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan and finished clear fourth. The Norwegian ended with a tally of 13 points. Carlsen, Kramnik and Aronian emerged as the best blindfold players with 7 points each.         
	Anands blindfold game against Wang Yue was one of fluctuating fortunes. Earlier it seemed that the Chinese was well on his way to a major upset when he sacrificed a piece for a dangerous initiative coming out of a Slav defence where Anand played black.         
	The sacrifice was correct, but Yue was also very short on time having less than two minutes against Anands eighteen. With his clock ticking away, the Chinese slipped and Anand got winning chances.         
	Anand eventually landed in an endgame of two knights against king and pawn. He gave up his attempts after 85 moves. (PTI)

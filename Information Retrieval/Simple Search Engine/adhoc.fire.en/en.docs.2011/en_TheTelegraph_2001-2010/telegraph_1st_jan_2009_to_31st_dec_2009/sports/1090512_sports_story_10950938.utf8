                                                   Racism in KKR camp: Jadeja
                      
	New Delhi: Former India Test cricketer Ajay Jadeja made a sensational claim on Monday, saying that the Indian players were being ill-treated by the foreign staff of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in the ongoing Indian Premier League in South Africa.         
	Jadeja hinted that a member of the KKR foreign coaching staff had racial overtones to his language used for an Indian player. I can assure you that there is definitely a divide and Indian players are being treated very badly. Jadeja told a television channel.         
	I am an Indian player. I know so many players in the team (the Kolkata Knight Riders). One player was asked to come off the field and when he asked Why did you want me to come off the field? one of the coaches in the KKR said You Indian, you do what I ask you to do, he said.         
	There is definitely a divide. I know it from the source himself. The players are not feeling comfortable, he added. (PTI)

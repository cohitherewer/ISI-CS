            OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT                       
	Calcutta: Indian jockey Malesh Narredu put in a creditable performance at the Ascot on Saturday despite not winning any of the five races he rode in, in the six-event card of Shergar Cup.         
	Malesh, who represented the Rest of the World, was up against the formidable Irish, British and Europe teams. Skipper Ahmed Ajtebi of Dubai and Hiroyuki Uchida of Japan were the other members of Malleshs team.         
	According to information received here, Malesh, possibly the first Indian to ride at the Ascot, finished third on 8-1 outsider Sabotage in the Titanic Quarter Shergar Cup Classic Handicap, over a mile and quarter. The third place was Maleshs best finish on the day.         
	Pollys Mark, guided by Irish jockey Richard Hughes, won the race. Hughes went on to boot home two more winners  Well Come and Press The Button  all priced winners, presenting Hughes a 377-1 treble.         
	A source close to Malesh told The Telegraph: Maleshs last years experience, in a similar kind of contest  Rest of the World versus South African Jockeys at Johannesburg  helped his cause. The Berkshire track was unknown for both Malesh and Uchida whereas Hughes and other European jockeys knew virtually every blade of grass.         
	The Royal Ascot meeting can trace its roots back to the earliest days of thoroughbred racing in England. Racing at Ascot enjoyed immediate popularity, and in no time had the meeting become an annual event hosted over four days.         
	According to Royal Ascot history, the first of the modern Royal Ascot feature races was added to the meeting in 1808 with the running of the Royal Ascot Gold Cup. The other four feature races were added during the next five decades, as the modern incarnation of the festival gradually took shape.

	Trainer Leo DSilvas ward Coral Gables bid adieu to the turf which the eight-year-old horse ruled for five years.           
	Coral Ga-bles swan song came last Sunday after yet another stylish victory, his twenty eighth, on way to winning the H P Mistry Mem-orial Cup, a Category I race, which was the star attraction on the day at the Malakpet race course in Hyderabad. The champion also represented the country in the Dubai Racing Carnival about three years ago.

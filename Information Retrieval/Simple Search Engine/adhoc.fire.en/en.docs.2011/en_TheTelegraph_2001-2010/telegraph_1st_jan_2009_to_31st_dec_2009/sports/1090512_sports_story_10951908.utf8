                                                   Bowling did it for us: Gilly
            OUR BUREAU                      
	The Deccan Chargers 53-run victory over the Rajasthan Royals in an Indian Premier League (IPL) match on Monday propelled them to the third spot on the league table, behind the Delhi DareDevils and the Chennai Super Kings.         
	While the semi-final slots are still up for grabs, with the above three leading the pack, the Kolkata Knight Riders are the only team who have almost no chance to make it to the last four. Even if the Knight Riders win their remaining four matches, they will only manage 11 points while the top three in the table already have 14, 13 and 12 points in their kitty respectively.         
	Adam Gilchrist, captain of the victorious Deccan Chargers, said that clinical performance from his bowlers aided the victory. It was a good performance by us today (Monday). Dwayne (Smith) batted beautifully to take us to a challenging total. But it was some clinical bowling that helped us restrict them to 113. (Chaminda) Vaas was excellent, said the former Australian wicketkeeper.         
	Gilchrist was also elated with Rohit Sharmas performance with the ball. He seems to be in the running for the purple cap rather than the orange cap, he said while commenting on Rohit, who took three for 12 in three overs.         
	He admitted that the selection of foreign players was a happy problem for the Hyderabad side.

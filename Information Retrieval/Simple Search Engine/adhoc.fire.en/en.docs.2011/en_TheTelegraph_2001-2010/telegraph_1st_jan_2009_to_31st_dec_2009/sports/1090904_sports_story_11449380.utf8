                                                     Dhoni hammers unbeaten 106

	Mohali: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (106) and Manvinder Bisla (152) saw Air India Blue through to the semi-finals after they slammed unbeaten centuries in their massive 136-run victory over Indian Revenue in a rain-truncated group A match in the Sahara BCCI Corporate trophy here Thursday.         
	In a match that was reduced to 42 overs per side due to repeated rain-interruptions, Indian Revenue captain Amay Kurasyias decision to field backfired as the Air India Blue top-order put up a relentless display of aggressive batting at the PCA stadium. Dhoni alone accounted for seven fours and six sixes in his 61-ball unbeaten hundred.         
	In the run chase, opposition opener Ameya Shrikhande made a valiant effort with a 119-ball 121 but he found no support from the other batsmen in the team. Shrikhande batted till the 38th over, hitting 16 fours and a six. Indian Revenue ended their allotted 42 overs for just 222 from the loss of eight wickets.         
	With Thursdays win, Air India Blue topped their group with seven points and will take on group C winners Tata Sports Club in the second semi-final here on Sunday.         
	In Bangalore, Air India Red joined Dhonis team after Suresh Raina smashed an unbeaten 92 for a thumping seven-wicket victory over Indian Cements in their last group D match.         
	Raina sent the Indian Cements bowlers for a leather hunt in his 107-ball innings which was studded with seven fours and two sixes at the Chinnaswamy Stadium here.         
	Earlier, put in to bat, India Cements made 243 for nine thanks mainly to contributions from S. Badrinath (91) and Rahul Dravid (66) after the match was reduced to 47 overs a side following a brief shower during the 15th over.         
	In Dharamshala, Tata SC strolled into the semis after their crucial and last Group C match against Indian Oil was washed out due to continuous downpour at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association stadium. The Ajit Agarkar-led Tata SC, by virtue of their win against All India Public Sector Sports Promotion Board (AIPSSPB) in the rain-truncated group C opener Tuesday, moved to the last four stage. They will face Air India Blue on Sunday at Mohali.         
	In Visakhapatnam, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation became the fourth semi-finalist after their last group B match against Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to rain.

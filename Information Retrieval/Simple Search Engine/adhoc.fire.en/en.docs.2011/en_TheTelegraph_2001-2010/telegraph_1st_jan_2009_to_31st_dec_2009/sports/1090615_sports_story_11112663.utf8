	London: Alan Donald is impressed with South Africas performance in the ongoing World Twenty20 and has termed Graeme Smiths men the favourites.         
	South Africa have a great chance to win. They look the part and they will be difficult to stop. Where they are outsmarting people is in the field. Its a long time since Ive seen a South African side so sharp, so quick, full of athletes and so young, Donald said.

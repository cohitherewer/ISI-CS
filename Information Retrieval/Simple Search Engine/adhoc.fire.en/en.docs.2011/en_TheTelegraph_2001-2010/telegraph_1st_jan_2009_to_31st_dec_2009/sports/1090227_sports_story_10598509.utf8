The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Drogba finds the winner for Chelsea
                                                     Drogba finds the winner for Chelsea
                  Bayern Munichs Franck Ribery after scoring against Sporting in Lisbon on Wednesday (AP)                     
	London: Didier Drogba gave Chelsea a 1-0 home win in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 meeting with Juventus on Wednesday but last years runners-up might come to regret not finishing the tie off on the night.         
	In Lisbon, Bayern Munich took a big step towards a place in the quarter finals as Franck Ribery inspired them to a 5-0 thrashing of Sporting Lisbon. In Spain, hosts Villarreal played a 1-1 draw with Panathinaikos.         
	Drogba shot home after 12 minutes but should have had at least two more as Chelsea passed the Italians off the field in the first half. Juventus, managed by former Chelsea boss Claudio Ranieri, grew in confidence as the game progressed and though they extended a lamentable away record against English clubs that now features 11 defeats and only two wins from 17 visits they will travel home knowing the tie remains very much alive.         
	Im satisfied with the win but overall Im not satisfied, new Chelsea coach Guus Hiddink told reporters.         
	We started very well, we opened them up through the wings and were very dangerous. But after the goal we dropped back too far and got a bit anxious and Juve came into it much more.         
	Crisp-passing Chelsea were into their stride from the start and Drogba flashed a header over the bar after nine minutes.         
	Three minutes later he was handed another opportunity when Salomon Kalou slid a pass through a flat Juve defence. Frank Lampard stepped aside to allow Drogba to shoot low past Gianluigi Buffon.         
	Meanwhile, Ribery, the exquisitely talented playmaker who has carried Bayern for much of the last two seasons, struck twice in a devastating performance from the German side. Miroslav Klose also found the net for his sixth goal of the competition this season and Italian Luca Toni struck two in the last six minutes to underline Bayerns supremacy and give a reminder of the days in the 1970s when they dominated Europe.         
	Bayern came into the match following a home defeat against Cologne in the Bundesliga, but were a team transformed here, scoring goals from almost all of their chances.The result is positive for us as it opens the road to the quarter finals, Bayern manager Jurgen Klinnsmann said.         
	It is positive, especially since the last games did not go that well for us, but we cannot become overly enthusiastic and must prepare calmly for the match on Sunday against Werder Bremen, he added.         
	Sporting made history by reaching the knockout rounds for the first time, but will not recall this baptism fondly.         
	The feeling is one of frustration. Its not normal to lose with this type of result, said Sporting manager Paulo Bento.         
	He added that Sporting had been the better team in the first half, but became disorganised in the second half and let Bayern take control of the game.         
	In another match, hosts Villarreal came back to draw 1-1 with Panathinaikos. A Giorgos Karagounis thunderbolt from 25 metres gave the visitors the lead, with Giuseppe Rossi equalising from a penalty.

                                                   Scuffle mars EB-Bagan tie
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Eden on Saturday witnessed a nasty on-field scuffle during a CAB first division league match between archrivals Mohun Bagan and East Bengal.         
	Trouble began in the 73rd over of the East Bengal innings when Ritam Porel (20) was bowled by Ritam Kundu. Porel, who was taking his own time to walk out of the ground, got into an altercation with Bagan captain Manoj Tiwary.         
	This drove the officials and supporters of the respective clubs present at the stadium to rush onto the ground, resulting in a scuffle. There was pushing and shoving as the area in front of the dressing room turned into a virtual battlefield.         
	Timely intervention by some Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) officials, however, stopped things from running out of control. Both the players were let off with a caution by the on-field umpires.         
	Unfortunately, it all happened in the presence of Kolkata Knight Riders advisor-in-charge John Buchanan. He, however, refused to comment.         
	CAB joint secretary Arun Mitra said: I have cautioned Manoj and Ritam and the matter is being sorted out.         
	BRIEF SCORES

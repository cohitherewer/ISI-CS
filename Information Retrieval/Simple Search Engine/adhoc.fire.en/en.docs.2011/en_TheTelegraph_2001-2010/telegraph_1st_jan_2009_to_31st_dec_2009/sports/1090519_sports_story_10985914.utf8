The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The Royal Challengers need to dare devils
                                                     The Royal Challengers need to dare devils
                  Anil Kumbles captaincy has been inspirational                     
	Johannesburg: An uphill task awaits the Royal Challengers Bangalore when they take on the formidable Delhi DareDevils in the Indian Premier League here Tuesday.         
	The Bangalore outfit, who are at the sixth spot on the table with 12 points from as many matches, have everything to play for as a loss would undoubtedly throw them out of the semi-final race.         
	The DareDevils, on the other hand, are sitting pretty at the top, having already qualified for the semi-finals with 18 points from 12 matches, and will be hoping to carry forward the winning momentum to the last-four stage.         
	Apart from the semi-final spot up for grabs, the match also provides Anil Kumbles men with an opportunity to avenge their six-wicket loss to the DareDevils in the first leg of the tournament.         
	Although the Bangalore oufit are on a high after their last-match win over the second-placed Chennai Super Kings, they would need something spectacular Tuesday to beat the consistent DareDevils, who boast of innumerable match-winners.         
	A.B. de Villiers has been the pillar of their batting, while Tillekaratne Dilshan and Dinesh Karthik provide the much-needed firepower in the middle-order.         
	However, what remains a matter of concern for the DareDevils is the form of captain Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir. Both are still to fire in the tournament.         
	With a rejuvenated Asish Nehra and Dirk Nannes handling the new ball with elan, the DareDevils bowling has been more than impressive. Young Pradeep Sangwan has been consistent throughout, picking up crucial wickets, while Amit Mishra provides the sting to Delhis spin department.         
	In contrast, the Royal Challengers do not have equal riches at their disposal and it would take quite an effort to upset the DareDevils.                     
	The Royal Challengers top order has been pretty inconsistent with Jacques Kallis playing well in patches. Both Jesse Ryder and Robin Uthappa have been big dissapointments.         
	However, Ross Taylors return to form would please Kumble, who would be expecting the New Zealander to come good once again.         
	Although the Royal Challengers bowling has looked quite mundane, Kumble and Co. would take heart from the fact that they managed to restrict the Chennai Super Kings to just 129 in their last encounter.         
	Kumble would be expecting a similar show from his bowlers Tuesday to brighten their chances. The veterran leggie was named captain after Englands Kevin Pietersen left for his country to play in the Test series against the West Indies.         
	Even though Pietersen was not very successful with the bat, the Royal Challengers started their IPL campaign under him with a stunning victory over defending champions Rajasthan Royals. They bowled out Shane Warnes men for less than 100.

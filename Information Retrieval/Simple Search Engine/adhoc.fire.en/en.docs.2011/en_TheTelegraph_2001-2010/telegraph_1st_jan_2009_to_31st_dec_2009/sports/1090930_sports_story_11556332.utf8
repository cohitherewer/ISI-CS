The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Floyd Reifer promises tough fight
                                                   Floyd Reifer promises tough fight
                      
	West Indies captain Floyd Reifer, at a press conference on Tuesday, said that the fact that his team are already knocked out of the Champions Trophy would not dampen their spirit against India on Wednesday and they would do their best to put up a tough fight against Mahendra Singh Dhonis world No. 2 side.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On the lack of motivation for Wednesdays match as they have no chance of reaching the semi-finals         
	Were going to play the game with the same intensity as before. Were looking to improve every game. Its about improvement for us as individuals and as a team. We cant qualify doesnt mean were not going to play hard, tough cricket.         
	Their chances against India         
	In one-day cricket, the team that plays better on the day has a good chance of winning. India are a good side They have a lot of stars and they play a lot of one-day cricket, but were going to approach the game in the same way we approached the first two.         
	Whether they would take back any positives from South Africa         
	We can take a lot of positives from the tournament. Some of our guys bowled well, couple of our guys batted well, and, as a team, I think we played pretty good cricket.         
	On the impressive display by the West Indies pacers         
	We have a good squad of fast bowlers. They are all different type of bowlers. The guys have a lot of talent and are just looking to explode on the international circuit. Gavin Tonge is very tall and bowls a good line and length. (Kemar) Roach is very fast I think he bowled the fastest ball in the tournament so far. Hes very quick through the air and he has a bright, bright future for West Indies and international cricket. (David) Bernard is having a great tournament. Tino Best is quick as well.         
	Whether he is concerned with the pitch at the Wanderers         
	When we played our first two games, there was a bit of grass left on the track. What we saw against Sri Lanka and New Zealand, some of the grass had been shaved off. It still is offering bounce and whatever wicket we get, we would try to do our best.

                                                     Lack of grass is surprising: Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT                              
	Wellington: Visitors India, up 1-0 in the three-Test series, need just a draw to post a historic series win in New Zealand. But India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said that the team would approach the last Test with the mindset of a win and would not look for draw.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Indias approach going into the last Test leading 1-0         
	Its important to win the game, what you have done in a Test series so far doesnt have much importance. It is one of the most crucial games you will play and once you have the mindset of going for a draw, you are not aggressive enough to win a Test match. We will approach the game in the same way as we approached the first or the second Test.         
	The wicket         
	Looks like a good track. But here there is no pavilion, and wind the blows across the field, so definitely there will be swing for the fast bowlers. The spinners can use the same breeze to drift the ball. But it depends. Today its nice and cool, not much of breeze around. It will be quite a good track to bat on. But if it is breezy, like Wellington normally is, there will be a bit of help for the bowlers.         
	If the wicket matches his expectations         
	Well I was expecting a green track. Quite similar to the one you know could have got a glimpse of what 2003 tracks looked like. Looks like a nice track, so bowlers will have to put in hard work again. Batsmen, if they are careful and if their approach is good, you may see big scores on the board. Lets see. But there will definitely be a bit more help as compared to the last Test, because of the breeze. Maybe the bounce will be similar.         
	If he was surprised seeing the wicket         
	Of course I am a bit surprised.         
	The conditions in Wellington         
	Yesterday (Wednesday) it was quite cold. We had a good long session. We are quite comfortable. It is cold, we cant really do much about it. Put plenty of clothing, keep yourself warm thats what we can do.         
	If there will be major changes in the side         
	Doesnt look likely. Most unlikely that there will be changes unless there is some fitness issues tomorrow before the game.         
	On his fitness         
	If its regarding my back, I am. It has improved a lot, but we have to see how I am before the game because that will be very vital. Its a Test match, not a one-day game, where you know the maximum you have to keep for is 50 overs. But in a Test match, on a good flat track, you should be ready for 120 overs. Ill have to see how I am tomorrow morning.         
	If he will play the Test         
	I dont know I will see tomorrow morning.         
	Will the team suffer a lot if he doesnt play?         
	Not sure about it. I am with the side. I dont think I am that type of a player on whom the team relies a lot. The team is not bothered too much about my playing or not playing. It doesnt have a big impact on the team. Today was an optional session. So some of the guys who have missed out on todays (Thursday) session are not because of injuries or anything. They have opted out.

                                                   The India factor in it all
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Calcutta: Had Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. not expressed strong reservations about touring Pakistan and had that not been followed by 26/11, then the Sri Lankans wouldnt have been in Lahore on Tuesday.         
	The Telegraph, in fact, had been the first to report (November 25, 2008) on the possibility of such misgivings. Confirmation came quickly, just a couple of days later.         
	Dhoni, vice-captain Virender Sehwag and senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkar are the ones whod conveyed the players strong feelings to the Board.         
	That was done during the ODIs against England.         
	The Mumbai terror strikes came soon afterwards, making it impossible for New Delhi to okay the January 4-February 19 tour.         
	In any case, even before 26/11, the mood in the government hadnt been in favour of permission being given.         
	One learns the government wouldnt have approved a bilateral series on neutral ground either.         
	Once Team India pulled out, Sri Lanka stepped in, bringing Pakistan back to Test cricket.         
	Sadly, as it turned out, not for too long. For the Younis Khans, more frustrating days lie ahead.

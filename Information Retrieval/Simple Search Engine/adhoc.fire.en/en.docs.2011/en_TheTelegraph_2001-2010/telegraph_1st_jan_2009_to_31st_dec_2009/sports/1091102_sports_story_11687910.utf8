The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chirag wary of Sporting
                                                   Chirag wary of Sporting
                      
	Margao: Chirag United would be looking to keep the winning momentum going when they take on a depleted Sporting Clube de Goa in a sixth round match of the ONGC I-League Monday at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda.         
	High on confidence with three wins and two draws, Chirag would want to keep their unbeaten record against the Goan side intact. Sporting Clube are at the bottom with one point from four matches.         
	Chirag coach Subrata Bhattacharya will be looking to the Brazilian trio of strikers Edmilson and Joshimar and defender Eduardo for victory.         
	Sporting are a good side who are struggling to find form. We cannot underestimate them but have to remain vigilant and focused as they will come hard at us in search of their first victory, Bhattacharya said.         
	Sporting finished third last season but things have not been going too well for coach Roy Barretos boys.         
	In Shillong Salgaocar will be under pressure when they face a confident Lajong FC.         
	Lajong will play pressure football. We have seen it in their match against Mohun Bagan. It will be a tough match but we are ready, Salgaocar coach Tim Hankinson said.           (PTI)

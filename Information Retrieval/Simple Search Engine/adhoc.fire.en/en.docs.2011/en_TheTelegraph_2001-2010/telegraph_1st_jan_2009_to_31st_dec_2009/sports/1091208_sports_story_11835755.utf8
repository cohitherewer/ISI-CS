	New Delhi: With a quarter-final place at stake, a resurgent Delhi will take on Maharashtra, placed at the bottom of the table, in their last Ranji Trophy Super League Group B encounter here, from Tuesday.         
	Under new captain Virat Kohli, Delhi defeated Saurashtra to revive their campaign and the hosts will look to continue the good work against Maharashtra, who have lost two of their four matches so far. Delhi have nine points from four outings, having lost one, won one and drawn two matches so far. Although regular captain Aakash Chopra has returned to the squad after getting married, Kohli has been retained as skipper.         
	The right-hander is in red hot form and has scored a century and a fifty in three innings he has played so far. Delhi boast of a strong middle order with Rajat Bhatia, Gaurav Chhabra and Puneet Bisht in their ranks, and a lot would depend on these players performance.         
	Meanwhile, Mumbai will have their task cut out when they take on Tamil Nadu, sans two of their key players, in a crucial sixth round Group A encounter (PTI)

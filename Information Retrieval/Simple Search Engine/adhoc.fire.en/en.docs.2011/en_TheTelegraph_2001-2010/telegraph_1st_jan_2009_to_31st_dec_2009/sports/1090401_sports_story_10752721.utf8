The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania, Chuang rally into quarter finals
                                                     Sania, Chuang rally into quarter finals
                  Sania Mirza                     
	Miami: Sania Mirza and her partner Chuang Chia-jung of Taiwan rallied to stun eighth seeds Maria Kirilenko and Flavia Pennetta in a gruelling three-setter for a place in the womens doubles quarter final of the $4.5m Miami Masters here.         
	Sania and Chuang shocked the fancied Russian-Italian pair 4-6 7-6 (5) 10-4 to enter the last-eight stage.         
	The unseeded Indo-Taiwanese duo will next take on the winners of the match between the Argentine-Israeli team of Gisela Dulko and Shahar Peer and the Spanish combine of Anabel Medina Garrigues and Ruano Pascual.         
	Rafael Nadal, meanwhile, advanced to the fourth round of the Sony Ericsson Open by beating qualifier Frederico Gil 7-5, 6-3.         
	The top-ranked Nadal struggled with his second serve and was broken twice on Monday but gradually wore down Gil, who is ranked a career-best 74th.         
	The top men have avoided the wave of upsets that has marked the womens draw. The latest surprise was 18-year-old Caroline Wozniackis victory over fourth-seeded Elena Dementieva 7-5, 6-4.         
	Wozniacki, who last week was selected WTA Tour newcomer of the year for 2008, advanced to the quarter finals. She took advantage of 45 unforced errors by Dementieva.         
	Wozniacki is the first Danish woman to crack the top 20, reaching a career-high 12th in the rankings while benefiting from recent workouts in Las Vegas with Andre Agassis former trainer, Gil Reyes.         
	It feels amazing to me that Im the No. 12 in the world, Wozniacki said.         
	Despite a sluggish start and wobbly finish, Venus Williams defeated No. 10-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska 4-6, 6-1, 6-4. The three-time champion double-faulted three times in the last game before finishing with an ace.         
	Venus was playing for the third day in a row, and she looked weary in the warm, sunny weather. After dropping the first set, she began to move better and won 11 of the next 13 games.         
	I came out and things werent going the way I imagined. But thats tennis. I feel good. Ive been playing very well in the last few months.         
	Radwanska nearly overcame a 5-1 deficit in the final set, but she failed to convert three break points that would have made the score 5-all.         
	Venus finished with 40 unforced errors but also had 43 winners, hitting 11 aces. Her quarter final opponent will be No. 26-seeded Iveta Benesova, who swept No. 19 Anabel Medina Garrigues 6-4, 6-1.           (AGENCIES)

	Monte Carlo: World No. 1 Rafael Nadal reached the third round of the Monte Carlo Masters, although his easy-looking 6-2, 6-3 win masked a rusty performance against Argentine Juan Ignacio Chela on Wednesday.         
	The Spaniard, who is gunning for a fifth successive title, a record in the professional era, looked sloppy at times but regained composure when it mattered to wrap up the win after 86 minutes.         
	Nadal, who has now won his last 23 matches in Monte Carlo, will next take on either Russian Marat Safin or Ecuadors Nicolas Lapentti.         
	I played some games well. I played some terrible games. Up and down all the match, Nadal said. But I think it was a comfortable win. I was never scared of losing. Sometimes, things like this happen. I will try and not repeat these mistakes in the next match.         
	Roger Federer, who could face Nadal for a fourth consecutive final at the Monte Carlo Country Club, eased past Italian Andreas Seppi 6-4, 6-4.         
	The second-seeded Swiss appeared very relaxed on a sunbathed centre court, clinching victory on his fourth match point after a final burst from Seppi.         
	He will next face compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka for a quarter-final spot after the 13th seed beat Argentine Martin Vassallo Arguello 2-6, 7-5, 6-2.         
	I thought I played okay. I had a good stretch at the end of the first set, beginning of the second, Federer said.         
	Federer broke in the ninth game and took the opening set with a backhand winner down the line. Another stunning backhand winner earned him a break in the first game of the second set. The Swiss dismissed a break point with an angled serve which Seppi returned wide and another long return gave Federer his fifth victory in as many matches against the Italian.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - RCTC, CEO back on fast track
                                                                                                               RCTC, CEO back on fast track 
            STAR RACER      
	Calcutta: A near two-hour long presence of Lt Gen. (retd) J. R. Mukherjee, at the RCTC ground on Sunday was good enough to sort out all critical issues, including the running of the Derby, on February 28. General Mukherjee, who had resigned from the post of RCTCs CEO, attended the bipartite meeting along with the clubs top brass, and the RCTC Karmachari Unions (RKUs) representatives, as a special invitee. General Mukherjee had resigned following a club members misbehaviour last week.          
	The workers provident fund issue topped the agenda and everything fell into place after hard bargaining. Most importantly, General Mukherjee also agreed to take back his resignation. An RCTC insider revealed that the CEO accepted the apology from the offending club member in a forgive and forget spirit.          
	RCTC chairman Cyrus Madan was happy with the outcome of the meeting, and so was Jagmohan Masundrai, RKU general secretary.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Piquet shown the door by Renault
                                                   Piquet shown the door by Renault
                      
	London: Nelson Piquet Jr delivered a furious parting shot to Renault boss Flavio Briatore on Monday after discovering he was being dropped by the Renault team.         
	Piquet described Briatore, his manager as well as the team boss, as his executioner as he announced he would no longer be driving for Renault in the 2009 Formula One season.         
	I have received notice from the Renault F1 team of its intention to stop me from driving for them in the current F1 season, Piquet said in a statement.         
	A manager is supposed to encourage you, support you, and provide you with opportunities. In my case it was the opposite. Flavio Briatore was my executioner, Piquet said of Briatore.         
	The 24-year-old, son of triple world champion Nelson Piquet, had not scored a point all season.         
	Piquet said in his statement that in his 2008 debut season, racing alongside teammate and double world champion Fernando Alonso, he was relegated as someone who drives the other car.

                                                   Big blow for Yuvis men
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Kings XI Punjab were dealt a big blow with the injury to Australian opening batsman Shaun Marsh, the star for the team in the inaugural Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Marsh, last years top run-getter in the inaugural IPL, suffered a left hamstring injury during Australias first one-day International against Pakistan in Dubai on Wednesday. Marsh will be replaced by Marcus North in the Australian squad in Dubai.         
	Shauns recovery process will be monitored over the next two weeks before any decision can be made on his availability for the upcoming ICC Twenty20 World Championship, Australian team doctor Trefor James said in a statement.

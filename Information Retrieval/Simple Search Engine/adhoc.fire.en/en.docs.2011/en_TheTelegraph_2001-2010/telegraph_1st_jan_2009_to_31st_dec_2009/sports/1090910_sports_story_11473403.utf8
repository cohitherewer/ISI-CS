	Calcutta: Sir Garfield Sobers has emphasised that practice must be viewed as a serious endeavour and not a necessary inconvenience during a brief motivational address to the participants of the Digicel Cricket Clinic in Bridgetown.         
	According to a release, Sobers told the youngsters : Practising is very important, it is one of the most important things in cricket Not just practising but doing it the right way from a very young age. Some players practice to have fun and some players practice to be serious and improve their game, so I implore you to practice seriously.

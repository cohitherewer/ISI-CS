            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mumbai FC were held to a goalless draw by Sporting Clube de Goa in an eighth round I-League encounter here on Sunday. It was a disappointing show from the home team after their back-to-back victories in previous rounds.         
	It was Sporting who created the first oportunity when Michael Tayos 30-yard drive was well saved by custodian Lihaz Koya. Koyas impressive show earned him the man-of-the-match award. Mumbai FC side had a depleted look due to the absence of stopper E. Anas.         
	For the home team, it was Kiwi winger Kayne Vincent who was like a livewire in the left flank as he overlapped repeatedly keeping the opposition defenders busy. Vincents introduction in place of Subhas Chakraborty infused new life in the home team. It was one move by coach Khalid Jamil that helped the Mumbai outfit make a comeback.

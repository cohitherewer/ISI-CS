                                                   Bhutia set to play vs PFC
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: If everything goes right, Bhaichung Bhutias exile from domestic football is set to end on October 3 when East Bengal take on the newly promoted Pune Football Club (PFC) in their I-League opener in Pune.         
	The All India Football Federation (AIFF) general secretary Alberto Colaco said on Tuesday that he had already received the interim relief order for the Indian captain from Amarendra Sharan, the arbitrator in the Bhutia-Mohun Bagan dispute.         
	I have sent the order to all executive members for their opinion, said Colaco. I will pass on the order to the Indian Football Association for necessary actions after I receive the views of the executive members.         
	The AIFF general secretary also said: At least five or six members have already telephoned me to air their views on the subject. The members have been asked to send their opinions by tomorrow (Wednesday).         
	As per the rules, Bhutia can don the East Bengal colours against Pune FC only if he is registered at least 48 hours before the match. The East Bengal officials are hopeful of completing all paperwork by Thursday.         
	Meanwhile, Mohun Bagan have written to the AIFF alleging contradictions in the interim order passed by the arbitrator.

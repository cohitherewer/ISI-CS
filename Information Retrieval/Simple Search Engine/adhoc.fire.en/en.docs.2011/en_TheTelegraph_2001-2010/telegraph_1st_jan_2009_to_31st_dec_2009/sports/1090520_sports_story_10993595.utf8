                                                   Missed Bhutias class: Karim
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa on Tuesday refused to believe that Bhaichung Bhutias news conference on Monday had any bearing on the outcome of the AFC Cup match against Al Karamah.         
	A lot of factors went against us on the day. We missed three players (Dipak Mondal, Sangram Mukherjee and Marcos Pereira), and their replacements were young.         
	We were short on motivation as we did not have anything to play for in this match. Yeah, we missed Bhaichungs class but I dont think what happened on Monday had any effect on the team, he said.         
	Bencharifa said his team played well in patches and created some half chances but were undone by inexperience.         
	These boys are young. Give them some time, he said. Karim is leaving for Morocco on Wednesday and will not return before July 10.         
	From now on its vacation for me, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Al Karamah coach Mohammed Kwid said he never anticipated such a meek surrender from Bagan.         
	We were surprised. They were very good in the first leg, but I dont know what happened to them.         
	They missed Bhaichung, that tall defender (Peter Odafe), the Brazilian (Marcos) and the goalkepeer (Sangram Mukherjee), Kwid was candid at the post-match conference.

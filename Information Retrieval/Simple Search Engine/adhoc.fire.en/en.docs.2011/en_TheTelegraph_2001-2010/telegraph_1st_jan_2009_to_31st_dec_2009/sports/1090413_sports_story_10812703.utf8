	Madrid: A first-minute strike from Andres Iniesta and a Nasief Morris own goal gave Barcelona a 2-0 win over Recreativo Huelva on Saturday, a fifth straight victory that stretches their lead over Real Madrid to nine points.         
	Barcelona move to 75 points with eight matches left while second-placed Real are on 66. Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola left midfielder Xavi, Primera Liga top-scorer Samuel Eto and captain Carles Puyol out of the starting line-up following Wednesdays 4-0 thrashing of Bayern Munich in their Champions League quarter final first leg.         
	Thierry Henry was in his usual position on the left wing and it was his surging run that created the opening goal in the first minute, Iniesta side-footing the Frenchmans low cross past stranded Recreativo goalkeeper Asier Riesgo.         
	Sebastian Nayar had a chance to put relegation-threatened Recreativo level shortly after but his close-range shot was smothered by Riesgos opposite number Victor Valdes.         
	South African defender Morris cleared a Lionel Messi shot off the line and Henry had an effort ruled out for offside before the home side doubled their lead on 68 minutes when Iniestas attempted cross ricocheted in off Morris.         
	Messi suffered a rare failure from the penalty spot in the 81st minute when Riesgo saved the Argentines low effort after Jose Manuel Casado had handled a Daniel Alves cross.         
	Villarreal, in fourth, missed a chance to cut the nine-point gap between Sevilla when they lost 0-2 at home to Malaga later on Saturday.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wenger worried about Fabregas
                                                                                                                       7                                      Wenger worried about Fabregas

	Arsne Wenger will consider buying a central midfielder as well as a striker in January amid fears that Cesc Fabregas could be ruled out for three weeks with a hamstring injury.         
	Fabregas will undergo a scan to determine whether he pulled his hamstring or simply damaged the scar tissue during a remarkable 27-minute match-winning contribution against Aston Villa on Sunday. If he has only damaged the scar tissue, Fabregas could yet feature against Portsmouth on Wednesday.         
	Wenger had taken a gamble by even including Fabregas as a substitute after he first suffered hamstring damage almost two weeks ago against Burnley but, such was the Spaniards impact, there were no regrets.         
	If you can prove to me we would have won the game without him coming on the pitch I was wrong  but well never check that, said Wenger. I feel I did the right thing. I would do it again. Sometimes you follow your instincts in a game. You do what you think will win the game.         
	With Alex Song now joining up with Cameroon for the African Cup of Nations and Denison having suffered a back injury, Wenger has concerns about both his midfield and attack.         
	In midfield we could become short if we lose players, its an area we cannot afford to lose players, said Wenger. Ive said we will keep our eyes open. I will have to look maybe as well at midfielders and how big the damage is. At the moment I have not one name.         
	Having trailed Chelsea by 11 points at the end of November, Arsenal are now only four points behind the league leaders with a game in hand.         
	Wenger described Sundays result as massive and believes the turning point in Arsenals season may prove to be the second-half at Liverpool when they overturned a 1-0 deficit to win 2-1.

	Chennai: Wasim Jaffer led from the front with an unbeaten 162 as Mumbai, with Sachin Tendulkar yet to bat, piled up 268 for one on the opening day of their Ranji trophy semi-final against Saurashtra here on Sunday.         
	Six Saurashtra bowlers toiled for 90 overs and the lone success for them came when Rakesh Dhurv trapped Mumbai opener Vinayak Samant (49) lbw.         
	At stumps, Jaffer had Ajinkya Rahane (52 batting) for company.         
	Jaffers fluent unbeaten 162 came off 275 balls with 19 fours in it.         
	Rahane overcame a shaky start to hit two fours and a six en route to his unbeaten 154-ball 52.         
	With Tendulkar, Rohit Sharma, Abhishek Nayar and Amol Muzumdar to come next, a leather-hunt awaits the Saurashtra bowlers on Monday.         
	Jaffer put on 91 runs with Samant before adding 177 runs in 55 overs for the unbroken second wicket stand.         
	On a batting paradise, Jaffer didnt hesitate to bat first and the Mumbai skipper, along with Samant and Rahane, milked the Saurashtra attack dry.         
	With new ball colleagues Sandip Jobanputra and Balakrishna Jadeja maintaining a consistent line and length, runs were not easy to come by initially. But, once Jaffer and Samant got a hang of it, things began to change.         
	Jaffer soon opened up and the wristy flicks and elegant cover drives flowed from his bat.         
	Samant also cruised along and looked good for his fifty when he tried to sweep Rakesh Dhurv and missed the line to be adjudged leg before.         
	Rahane lived dangerously and looked quite jittery before he grew in confidence and hit Kamlesh Makwana for a mighty six.         
	Both Jaffer and Rahane went after the Saurashtra bowlers, adding 82 runs of 23 overs in the last session of the day.         
	Brief scores: Mumbai 268/1 (Jaffer 162 batting) vs Saurashtra. Match to continue. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Knew Taylor would do the job for us: Kumble
                                                     Knew Taylor would do the job for us: Kumble
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Brendon McCullum in action against the Royal Challengers Bangalore on Tuesday. (AFP)                           
	Centurion: Anil Kumble was confident that Ross Taylor would take the Royal Challengers Bangalore to victory against the Kolkata Knight Riders when the New Zealand batsman walked into the middle on Tuesday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Sitting in the dugout with more than 11 runs an over to get, you must have thought the game was over         
	You dont need to worry when Ross is there... I knew that he would do the job for us. Maybe we need to probably look at the death overs, the way we bowled. I think we gave away 15 runs too many. But it was still a good wicket to bat and we knew that their (Knight Riders) fifth bowler had to bowl two overs in the last six overs. Thats where we cashed in and Ross batted brilliantly.         
	Today after a long time, you had a very good opening stand         
	When you need nine runs per over at the start, the opening partnership is also important. It was important that we didnt give away wickets early on. (Jacques) Kallis and (Jesse) Ryder batted brilliantly to get us to 50, and from there on Ross paced his innings wonderfully well to get us there.         
	Are you playing too many batsmen in the side?         
	I dont think so. In T20 you have to basically back your batsmen. Vinay (Kumar, who got hit in the final overs) has done extremely well for us In todays match too, he bowled really well in the early overs and got a couple of wickets. Spinners have played an important role but Appanna unfortunately didnt come to the party today. The death overs is possibly what we need to look at going forward.         
	Is todays XI your core team now that you have a chance to make it to the semis?         
	I think this is more or less the core team. Pravin Kumar was obviously not fit today and we are hoping that he will be fit for the match day after. But Durban has different conditions and we have to look at the pitch and then take a call. But more or less, this is the side.

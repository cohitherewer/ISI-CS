The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | New car in early March
                                                   New car in early March
                      
	New Delhi: The new Force India car, equipped with Mercedes engine and McLaren gearbox, will be unveiled in Spain early March, team owner Vijay Mallya said here on Sunday.         
	Unveiling the inaugural edition of the Force India Formula One 2009 calendar, Mallya said the car is under construction but would be ready well before the series opener in Melbourne on March 29.         
	The new car, VJM 02, is under construction. It will have McLaren gearbox and Mercedes engine, which is a big change from VJM 01. We are going to unveil it at Jerez in early March, Mallya said.         
	Asked if lack of time to test the car is a concern for him, Mallya, also the team principal of the Formula One outfit, said: Not really. We will have six-day test which I think is enough. Besides, the facilities at our Silverstone factory is quite upto the mark and I think we would be ready for the first race.         
	Mallya also hailed the recent decision of the F1 teams to agree to a series of cost-cutting measures, including limiting expensive testing and a cheaper engine for smaller teams from 2010.

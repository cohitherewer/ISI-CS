The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Andy ready for return
                                                   Andy ready for return
                      
	Washington: Andy Roddick will use the confidence he gained by reaching last months Wimbledon final to fuel his bid for the US Open title, the American said on Monday.         
	Roddick, however, conceded that his epic five-set loss to Roger Federer at the All England Club was the culmination of an impressive year, not just a fabulous fortnight.         
	It does help my confidence going into the US Open the fact that I was recently able to navigate my way through a major tournament, Roddick told reporters at the Legg Mason Tennis Classic where he is the top seed.         
	Those results can only help on a short-term basis, going into the US Open. But nothings guaranteed. You still have to be in-form.         
	Roddick has been recovering from a hip injury and this week will play in his first tournament since his riveting 7-5, 6-7, 6-7, 6-3, 14-16 loss to Federer.

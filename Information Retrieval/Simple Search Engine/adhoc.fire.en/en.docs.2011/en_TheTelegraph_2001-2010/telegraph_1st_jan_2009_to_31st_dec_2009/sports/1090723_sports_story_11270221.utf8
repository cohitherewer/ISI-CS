The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Malik hundred gives Pak edge
                                                     Malik hundred gives Pak edge
                  Shoaib Malik after his century on Wednesday                     
	Colombo: Shoaib Malik scored 106 not out and put on two century stands Wednesday to help Pakistan reach 300 for five and lead by 366 runs over Sri Lanka at stumps on the third day of the final Test.         
	Malik hit 10 boundaries and two sixes in nearly five hours. He added 119 with Misbah-ul Haq (65) and an unbeaten partnership of 114 with Kamran Akmal (60 not out) as Pakistan bid to deny Sri Lanka a 3-0 series sweep.         
	Akmals ninth half-century came off 68 balls, including six boundaries and a six.         
	Misbah was the only batsman to be dismissed after the morning session, when three wickets fell. He hit five boundaries and a six in 149 balls before he chased a ball outside off stump from Angelo Mathews and was caught by wicket-keeper Kumar Sangakkara.         
	Pakistan lost their first wicket for the day when opener Fawad Alam on 16 scooped a return catch to bowler Thilan Thushara with six runs added to the overnight score of 16 for one.         
	Pakistan captain Younis Khan and Mohammed Yousuf shared a 32-run partnership before Khan was out leg before for 16 to a dubious decision by English umpire Ian Gould.         
	Television replays showed that Younis got an inside edge to an inswinger from Nuwan Kulasekera before the ball hit high on the pad.         
	Yousuf was next out for 23, pushing forward to an away-turning delivery by Herath and edging the ball to Sangakkara.         
	Regular wicket-keeper Tillekaratne Dilshan did not take the field for Pakistans second innings because of a fractured finger and a cut on the eyebrow after being hit by a ball while batting on Tuesday.         
	Herath was the best of Sri Lankas bowlers in the second innings with figures of two for 113.         
	Meanwhile, match referee Alan Hurst of Australia reprimanded Pakistani leg-spinner Danish Kaneria for using foul language on the field, the International Cricket Council said in a statement.         
	The incident took place after Kaneria took the wicket of Mathews during the second days play on Tuesday.           (AP)

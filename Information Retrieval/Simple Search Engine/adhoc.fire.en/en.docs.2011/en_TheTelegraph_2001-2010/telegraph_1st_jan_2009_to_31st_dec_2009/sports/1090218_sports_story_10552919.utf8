                                                   Mind-set needs to change: Gill 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Union sports minister M.S. Gill Tuesday stressed on the need for athletes and coaches to avoid taking recourse to doping as they prepare for the 2010 Commonwealth Games and the 2012 London Olympics.         
	I repeat what I said in Beijing, that I want India to win 50 medals in the next Olympics, but I dont mind winning none. I dont want to win (medals) by cheating, Gill said on Tuesday. Gill said that for the country to win more medals, our ethos has to change.         
	There is no time allotted for sports in our school curriculum  we have to become sports-minded, not gold (medal) minded, he said.         
	A sum of Rs 678 crore has been allotted to 1400 athletes over a period of two and a half years, and Rs 75 crore to get 50 synthetic training turfs for hockey under a programme to expand the SAI infrastructure, Gill informed.         
	Someone like PT Usha is getting a pension of Rs 4000. When something happens to the athletes they get Rs 30,000. I have immediately raised these figures by 100 per cent. Promotions and increments in this country are impossible. We have promoted 250 coaches, he said.

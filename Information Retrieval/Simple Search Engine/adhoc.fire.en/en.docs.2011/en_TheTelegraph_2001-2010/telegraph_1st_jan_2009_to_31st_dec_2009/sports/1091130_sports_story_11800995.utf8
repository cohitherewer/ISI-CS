	Port Elizabeth: England fast bowler James Anderson wrecked South Africas batting with a career-best five for 23 in the fourth one-day International at St Georges Park Sunday.         
	South Africa were bowled out for 119, their lowest ODI total at home.         
	Alviro Petersen, the least experienced in the Proteas top order, was the only batsman to shine with 51 off 79 balls and was the last man out. It was Petersens third successive half-century in the series.         
	The turnaround for England has been remarkable.         
	The visitors conceded 354 runs and took only six wickets in losing the third ODI by 112 runs, in Cape Town, on Friday.         
	South Africa captain Graeme Smith was dismissed by Stuart Broad off the eighth ball of the match and his side were unable to recover from that early blow.         
	Smith gambled by batting first in overcast conditions on a pitch with slightly more grass than usual and the early loss of their leading batsmen exposed a lengthy tail.         
	Anderson bowled superbly in two spells and benefited from some bold captaincy by Andrew Strauss.         
	After a first spell of two for 17 in six overs, Strauss brought back his strike bowler in the 21st over to press home the advantage.         
	Anderson responded by taking three more wickets and had completed his quota by the end of the 27th over. By then, South Africa had lost seven wickets for 85 runs.         
	Tim Bresnan provided excellent support, taking one for 15 in an unbroken spell of eight overs.         
	England openers Andrew Strauss and Trott then eased their way to 74 before off-spinner Johan Botha trapped the visiting captain leg-before for 32 and had Kevin Pietersen caught for three in a fine spell of two for 22 in eight overs.         
	Trott stayed through to the end, however, scoring a top-class 52 not out off 77 balls, while Eoin Morgan made 28 not out in 40 balls in the canter to victory.         
	South Africa will attempt to level the series in the final match in Durban on Friday.         
	South Africa pacer Dale Steyn was missing with a strained hamstring.         
	He was replaced by Charl Langeveldt.         
	Off-spinner Johan Botha replaced left-arm spinner Roelof van der Merwe in the second change in the home team. England named an unchanged team.         
	The series is level at one-one with the first match having been rained off.           (AGENCIES)

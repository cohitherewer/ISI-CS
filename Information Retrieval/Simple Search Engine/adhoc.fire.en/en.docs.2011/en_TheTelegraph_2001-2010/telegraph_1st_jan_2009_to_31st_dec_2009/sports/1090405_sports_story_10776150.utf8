The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Christina, Kristy in joint lead
                                                   Christina, Kristy in joint lead
                      
	Rancho Mirage: Americans Christina Kim and Kristy McPherson took advantage of favourable morning conditions to grab a share of the lead in Fridays wind-swept second round of the Kraft Nabisco Championship.         
	 Kim birdied the last two holes for a three-under-par 69, setting the pace with McPherson (70) in the first womens major of the year.         
	The pair ended their rounds at Mission Hills Country Club as the winds began to gust up to 65kph, removing limbs from a few trees and blowing palm fronds across some of the fairways.         
	Former U.S. Womens Open champion Cristie Kerr of the United States fired a best-of-the-day 68 to finish at five under, one ahead of compatriot and first-round leader Brittany Lincicome (74).         
	Mexican world number one Lorena Ochoa was eight off the pace after carding a second successive 73 while American teenager Michelle Wie made the cut right on the number after battling to an 81.

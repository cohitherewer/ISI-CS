The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Owen on target for United again
                                                     Owen on target for United again
                  Manchester Uniteds Michael Owen vies for the ball with Md Azmi Muslim of Malaysia XI during their friendly in Kuala Lumpur on Monday. (Reuters)                     
	Kuala Lumpur: Michael Owen was on target for the second consecutive match as Manchester United defeated a Malaysia XI 2-0 in Kuala Lumpur.         
	Given the opportunity to atone for a less-than-convincing 3-2 win against the same opposition at the Bukit Jalil Stadium on Saturday, United this time exerted total control over their opponents.         
	Federico Macheda, now installed as Uniteds fourth-choice striker following the summer exits of Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez, was first to make his mark after 11 minutes. The Italian calmly stroked the ball into the corner after Ryan Giggs had supplied a low cross.         
	And on Uniteds next attack, Owen carried on where he left off at the weekend when he scored the late winner, profiting from some shambolic defending from the hosts, who failed to clear a Zoran Tosic cross, allowing the England striker to take aim and fire home the second goal.         
	Owen might have had another midway through the half, with Tosic again the supplier, this time with a wickedly curling cross that invited the near-post flick. It looked like being the third goal, only for Owen to be denied by the inside of a post.         
	With Giggs dictating the tempo in midfield and Tosic supplying plenty of width on the left, even if his final ball was sometimes slightly wayward, United were always a threat.         
	In contrast, Malaysia rarely got near enough to the United goal to get their hopes raised. Indra Putra Mahayuddin embarked on one mazy run just before the break but he was halted in his tracks by Wes Brown.         
	With Ferguson keen to build up Owens fitness progressively, he replaced the 29-year-old with Dimitar Berbatov on 62 minutes, shortly after Brazilian full-back Fabio had been replaced by Patrice Evra due to injury.         
	Fabio was initially carried off on a stretcher, but the teenager was able to walk around the side of the pitch before returning to the bench.         
	The Red Devils decided to play against Malaysia again after canceling a planned match in Indonesia in the wake of Fridays bomb attack on the Jakarta hotel where they were due to stay. They will depart Wednesday for the next leg of their Asia tour in Seoul and then on to China.         
	Meanwhile, Rooney believes Owen will enjoy a new lease of life at United and help ensure a smooth transition to life after Cristiano Ronaldo at Old Trafford.         
	With 29-year-old Owen making the perfect start in a United shirt, Rooney is confident that his former England teammate will thrive once again at Old Trafford.         
	Rooney said: With Cristiano leaving, it does leave a huge hole when it comes to goals and that is why it is important that the likes of myself, Berba and Michael chip in.         
	We all need to score more goals than we managed last year, especially me and Berba, and hopefully we can do that.         
	Ive played with Michael for England many times, though, so I know him well and he has looked really sharp in training.         
	He is working very hard and you could see by the way all the lads celebrated with him on Saturday how pleased they were for him when he scored.         
	I didnt have any idea he was going to sign for United, but when I heard the news that he joining us, I spoke to him on the phone.         
	We are delighted to get him. He is a great goal scorer, a good finisher, and were all sure he will bring us some goals.         
	I think the move will give him a new lease of life. Over the last couple of years, hes had some criticism but it would have been difficult for any player to score in that Newcastle team.         
	Im sure he will get goals this season and I am looking forward to playing with him.         
	With Ronaldo gone, Rooney can now expect to carry the burden of expectancy at Old Trafford, but the 23-year-old insists that he and the United players have no axe to grind with Ronaldo following his decision to leave.         
	Rooney said: I have spoken to him (Ronaldo) since he left. He was a great player for Manchester United but it was his wish to go and I think the club have respected that.         
	He did a great job for us and the money we got for him was unbelievable, but we dont feel let down by him. We always knew he was going to go sometime.         
	For both the club and for himself, it was a good deal. The money we got for him, and the six years we had out of him, was brilliant. So we wish him well.           (AGENCIES)

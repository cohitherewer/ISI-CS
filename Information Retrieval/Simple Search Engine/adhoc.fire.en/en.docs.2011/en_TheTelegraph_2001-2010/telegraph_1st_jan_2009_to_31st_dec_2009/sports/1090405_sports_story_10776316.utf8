The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United desperate for victory
                                                   United desperate for victory
            Oliver Kay                      
	Not for the first time in his 22 years and five months as Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson pointed an accusatory finger at the media on Friday, but, rather than screaming about hate-driven conspiracies against his team the Scot cited the eulogies to his so-called Untouchables as an unwelcome distraction that may have contributed to their recent wobble in the Premier League.         
	United drew much praise for the remarkable run of 11 consecutive wins that took them clear at the top of the table, while winning the Carling Cup and progressing in the FA Cup and Champions League, but Ferguson believes that the positive publicity may have had a negative effect on some of his younger players in the subsequent defeats by Liverpool and Fulham. He will urge them to put that right against Aston Villa on Sunday, irrespective of the absence of Nemanja Vidic, Paul Scholes and Wayne Rooney through suspension and Anderson and Dimitar Berbatov through injury.         
	Weve had quite a humdrum time since going to Japan for the World Club Cup, catching up the leaders and then having to listen to all the nonsense from you lads [the media] about how magnificent we are, Ferguson said on Friday.         
	Im trying to dampen things down, trying to dismiss all the talk about five trophies. The job is done for me by the Fulham result. What it has done is get rid of all that nonsense about us being untouchable and unbeatable. Weve been done a favour. Were into a situation where we can concentrate on playing football and not reading newspapers. There has never been a game won in a paper yet.         
	With so many key players missing, United will be desperate to return to winning ways against Villa, especially since by the time they kick off they may have been replaced by Liverpool at the top of the table. It is the first of two games in a little more than 48 hours for United, who take on Porto at Old Trafford in a Champions League quarter final on Tuesday.         
	That schedule represents a gamble on the part of Ferguson, who rejected an offer, from the Premier League and Sky television, to have the Villa game brought forward to lunchtime on Saturday because he was anxious about fatigue among his players after the international break. In particular he has concerns about Carlos Tevez, the Argentina forward, who returned to Manchester on Friday afternoon after a gruelling journey from a World Cup qualifying match in Bolivia  or Mars, as Ferguson called it.

            STAR RACER                                      
	Calcutta: The seven-year-old Samarkhand defied his advancing age and complemented trainer Patrick Quinn with a workmanlike victory in the 1,200m Bhishma Cup on Saturday. Jockey J. Chinoy also gave the 11-4 second favourite a judicious ride. The jockey had the horse settled behind Piato, till a furlong from home, before leaving the leader and also the Vijay Singh-trained 13-10 favourite Arktouros (C. Alford-up)  in a wild goose chase. Vijays Arnatta and Arctic Force, however, won their respective events.RESULTS

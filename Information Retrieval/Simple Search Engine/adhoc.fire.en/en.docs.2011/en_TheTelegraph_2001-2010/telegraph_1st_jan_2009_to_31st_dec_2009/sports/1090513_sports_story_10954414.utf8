	Guangzhou: Saina Nehwal sizzled as India routed Ukraine 5-0 in group 3B to stay on course for promotion to the next tier of the Sudirman Cup badminton tournament here.         
	After steamrollering Australia 4-1 in their tournament opener, Saina and her compatriots put up a better show Tuesday at the Guangzhou Stadium to blank their opponents.         
	World No.10 Saina was in full control in her match against Mariya Diptan whom she dismissed 21-18, 21-9 in just 22 minutes.         
	Arvind Bhat too ambled to an easy win, defeating Valeriy Atrashchenkov 21-16, 21-11 in a 31-minute encounter.         
	Earlier, Sanave Thomas teamed up with Rupesh Kumar to outplay Vitaly Konov and Dmytro Zavadsky 21-14, 21-6 in just 21 minutes and give India a 1-0 lead.         
	The seasoned mixed doubles pair of V. Diju and Jwala Gutta quelled a late challenge from Dmytro Zavadsky and Diptan before taming them 21-15, 22-20 to complete the rout.         
	Indias third and final game in group 3B is against Scotland Wednesday.         
	If India top the group, they would take on the country that finishes top of Group 3A and the winner would be promoted to Group 2. (PTI)

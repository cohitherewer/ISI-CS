                                                                                                                       7                                      Sreesanth to be discharged soon
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chandigarh: Sreesanth, who is recuperating from swine flu at Fortis Hospital, in nearby Mohali, since Thursday, is expected to be discharged on Wednesday.         
	Sreesanths condition is stable and his vital parameters are normal. If he continues to show similar signs he could be discharged on Wednesday or even earlier, a hospital spokesperson said Sunday.         
	According to the hospital authorities, Sreesanth, who has been kept in isolation, is keen to get back into the Indian team. He has been responding well to treatment. He is doing exactly what he has been told to do like a very good patient, a doctor attending on the cricketer said.         
	Hospital sources said Sreesanth watched the entire T20 match Saturday from his bed. He was very happy after the victory, the doctor added.         
	The Indian and Sri Lankan teams, meanwhile, left for Rajkot by a chartered flight in the afternoon. The entire team has been advised to report to the health authorities wherever they play if anyone is suffering from sore throat, high fever and body ache, a doctor said.         
	Doctors at the hospital said even if Sreesanth is discharged Wednesday he would have to rest for at least a week before resuming practice.         
	The selectors are unlikely to include anyone in place of Sreesanth for the first two ODIs.         
	The Indian team had heaved a sigh of relief early Saturday after opener Gautam Gambhir, manager Mayank Parekh and video analyst Dhananjay tested negative for the H1N1 virus.         
	Parekh was hospitalised with flu-like symptoms. Gambhir and Dhananjay, too, showed mild symptoms, prompting the team management to get them tested as a precautionary measure.         
	Meanwhile, Punjab Cricket Association official Sushil Kapoor has been appointed manager of the Indian team for the ODI series against Sri Lanka, reports PTI.

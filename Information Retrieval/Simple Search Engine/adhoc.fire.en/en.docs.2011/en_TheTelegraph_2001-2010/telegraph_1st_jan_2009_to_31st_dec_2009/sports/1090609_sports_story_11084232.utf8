	Nottingham: Ajantha Mendis and Lasith Malinga took three wickets each to restrict Australia to 159 for nine in their crucial Group C encounter in the ICC World Twenty20, here Monday.               
	Sri Lanka defeated Australia by six wickets to knock them out of the World T20. Lanka reached the target with one over to spare. Tillekaratne Dilshan scored 53 and Kumar Sangakkara remained unbeaten on 55.               
	Mendis (3/20) accounted for skipper Ricky Ponting, Shane Watson and Michael Hussey while Malinga (3/36) dismissed Brett Lee (15) and Nathan Hauritz (4) in the final over to stifle the Australian innings which needed some power hitting from Mitchell Johnson (28 ..) and David Hussey (28) to take the team past the 150-run mark.         
	Australia had a terrible start when David Warner (0) slashed Angelo Mathews to Tillekaratne Dilshan at point.         
	Kumar Sangakkara sprang an early surprise by opening the bowling with Angelo Mathews on his Twenty20 international debut and the move worked perfectly when David Warner carved his third ball to point.         
	Sri Lanka had gambled by leaving out two frontline seamers in Nuwan Kulasekara and Farvez Mahroof, knowing that spin would play a crucial role.         
	Ricky Ponting joined Shane Watson and the duo staged a recovery, adding 57 runs in 31 deliveries. Watson took 14 runs off debutant left-arm pacer Isuru Udanas first over, followed by Ponting, hitting Malinga for three successive fours.         
	However, the duo looked all at sea once Mendis came into the picture. Ponting tried to hit Mendis against the spin and saw his leg-stump uprooted for 25.         
	The skippers 15-ball innings included five hits to the fence. Watson (22) followed soon after, this time Mendis trapping him in front of the stumps to end his 21-ball knock that included two fours and a six. Brad Haddin (16) managed to hit Sanath Jayasuryia for a six but saw his stumps shattered by a Malinga slower. Udana then dismissed Michael Clarke (11) with a brilliant caught and bowled and at 79 for five, Australia were in all sorts of trouble.         
	With Michael Hussey (1) following soon after, it was left to David and Johnson to prop up the innings. Davids 22-ball innings included three sixes and a couple of fours while Johnsons unbeaten 13-ball knock had one six and a boundary. Lee also chipped in with two boundaries and a six to help push Australias total to 159.         
	David, who had spoken about taking over Andrew Symonds role, managed a huge six but his brother, Michael, was not so fortunate when he was trapped by one that turned back into him quickly.         
	The next over proved Australias best of the innings as Muralidharan was taken for 21 with Johnson launching two huge slow-swept sixes over deep mid-wicket and it signalled a revival.

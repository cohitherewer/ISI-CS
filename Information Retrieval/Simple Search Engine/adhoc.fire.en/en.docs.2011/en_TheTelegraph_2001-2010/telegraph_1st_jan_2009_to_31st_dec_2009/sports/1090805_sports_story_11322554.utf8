                                                     Captain or not, Sourav   is mentor
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Sourav Ganguly in Mumbai on Tuesday. (AFP)                                 
	Mumbai: The Kolkata Knight Riders team management Tuesday said Sourav Ganguly will be involved as a mentor in the upcoming season but shed no light on his chances of returning as captain of the franchise.         
	After Tuesdays meeting the franchise said that the former India captain would be part of the decision-making group in the future.         
	Sourav (Ganguly) will be involved in the role of a mentor, whether he is captain or not, KKR team director Joy Bhattacharjya told reporters after a five-hour meeting of the franchise bosses, along with Sourav, at principal owner Shah Rukh Khans residence here.         
	Asked specifically whether Sourav had been appointed mentor, Bhattacharjya said: All that I am trying to say is, whatever decision is made, Sourav will be involved as a mentor.         
	The franchise might not have ruled out Souravs chances of returning as captain, but the term mentor could be a sign of things to come.         
	The only thing that we have in mind is that we need people who are well-wishers of the team, who have been a part of and understood KKR and know what went wrong last time. Who know whats needed to be done right this year, the team director said on the logic behind including Sourav among the decision-makers.         
	Bhattacharjya said that the franchise hoped to have a coach in place by the end of the month.         
	Our first task is to find a new coach. Then we need to look at the list of players for the next year The new players and the international players, who would be available, he said.         
	There are so many good coaches around the world. Nothing has been decided yet... But we want to get this matter finished by the end of August.         
	The meeting stretched well into the evening as a mini crowd began to gather in front of Mannat, Shah Rukhs palatial house.         
	This was our first meeting in more than two months. Our first task was to decide the agenda for the next three months.         
	We all know that we had a very tough IPL... SRK had given us these two months to introspect, Bhattacharjya said.         
	The last season was disappointing... There were a lot of problems but there was no racism, he said, when asked about the controversy surrounding the teams campaign in South Africa.         
	There might have been issues between players but it was not in terms of white vs black, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand closes in on title 
                                                   Anand closes in on title 
                      
	Miskolc (Hungary): Viswanathan Anand took an unassailable 4-2 lead against Hungarian Grandmaster Peter Leko by winning the fifth and drawing the sixth game of the eight-game rapid contest here.         
	With just two games remaining, Anand is only a draw away from adding another feather to his already bulgy cap. The world champion will play the seventh game with white pieces and in all likelihood, a draw will ensure the Indian his maiden title in Miskolc rapid, an event which is now a regular feature wherein local star Leko takes on a world class player every year.         
	Anands brilliant tactic to stick with Grunfeld Defence paid off again as he won the fifth game with black pieces. Leko, an exponent of the opening himself, had a draw in sight but misplayed and went down after a long fight.         
	They followed the variation they had played earlier in the event till the 11th move and Leko was the first to deviate, showing his intentions to go for a full bloodied battle.         
	Anand was well armed and efficient play ensured his position always remained stable. Leko lost a pawn after the dust subsided and reached a rook and knights endgame with pawns on board. With correct play the game could have been a draw but Leko did not find the best defensive resources.

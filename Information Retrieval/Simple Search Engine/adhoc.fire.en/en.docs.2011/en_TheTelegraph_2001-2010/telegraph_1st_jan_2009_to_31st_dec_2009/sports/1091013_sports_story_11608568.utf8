	Bangalore: Jacques Kallis smashed a breezy unbeaten 73 and took three wickets to steer the Royal Challengers Bangalore to the Super Eight stage of the Champions League as the India Premier League runners-up trounced Otago Volts by 80 runs here Monday.         
	The hosts joined the Cape Cobras from Group C after winning their do-or-die match convincingly.         
	The Bangalore top-order put on a superb show after opting to bat first, as all the four batsmen who came in to bat, made contributions in making a massive 188 for two.         
	The hosts then skittled out the New Zealand side for a paltry 108, with 2.1 overs to spare.         
	Kallis, who carried his bat through the innings, put on a quick-fire 75 for the first wicket with Robin Uthappa (42), to give Bangalore a brilliant start.         
	Ross Taylor (32) played an incredible cameo as he scored 24 runs in the last over of the Bangalore innings, creaming three sixes and a boundary. Virat Kohli (32) also showed his potential after Uthappas dismissal.         
	After a superb show with the bat, Kallis (3/18) bowled a magical spell at the start of the Volts innings, before polishing off the tail.         
	Kallis struck twice in his second over  dismissing Brendon McCullum and Aaron Redmond within three balls.         
	Skipper Anil Kumble (2/20) and R. Vinay Kumar (2/20) took two wickets apiece.         
	Hashim Rutherford hit Vinay for three boundaries to break the shackles, but soon became Kalliss third victim when he lofted a slower to Kumble at mid-off.         
	Royal Challengers spinners also got into the act. They got rid of three more batsmen, sealing the fate of the champions of New Zealand.         
	Kumble trapped Nathan McCullum (8) and Ian Butler (1) in successive overs, while Roelof van der Merwe trapped Dmitri Mascarenhas in front of the wicket.         
	Craig Cumming was the highest run-getter for the Volts with his 20-run knock.         
	Earlier, Kallis played a measured innings, a cocktail of aggression and defence as his 73 came off 59 balls and contained four boundaries and two sixes.         
	Uthappa was also in great touch. He took 31 balls for his 42, which had five fours and two shots over the fence.         
	Kallis and Uthappa began on a cautious note and opened up after getting their eyes in, still managing to score at nearly six per over.         
	The South African got his first boundary  a furious square cut off Mascarenhas  in the fourth over, and Uthappa opened the gates with a huge six in the same over.         
	A lofted drive off Warren McSkimming to the straight boundary and another one off Ian Butler, by Uthappa, were really classy         
	With nothing working for them, Cumming brought Nathan McCullum into the attack, but to his horror, Uthappa welcomed him with a six and followed it up with a reverse-swept boundary.

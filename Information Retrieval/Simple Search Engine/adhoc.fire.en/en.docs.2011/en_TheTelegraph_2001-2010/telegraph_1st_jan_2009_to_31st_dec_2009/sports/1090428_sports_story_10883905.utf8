The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev rises to 36th
                                                   Jeev rises to 36th
                      
	New Delhi: Jeev Milkha Singh rose a place to 36th in the latest golf rankings but missing the cut in the Ballantines Championship cost Jyoti Randhawa three places as the lanky pro slipped to 113th. Randhawa missed the cut at the Ballantines Championship, co-sanctioned by European and Asian Tours, with a below-par two-day total of 149 to slip from his previous weeks 110th place.         
	However, Jeev, who took a break last week after missing the cut in Verizon Heritage on the PGA Tour, moved one placed up the ladder. Among other Indians, Arjun Atwal was placed 244th, while S.S.P. Chowrasia was ranked 358.         
	Tiger Woods continues as No.1 with fellow American Phil Mickelson, at No.2, hot on his heels. Sergio Garcia of Spain was at No.3.         
	Jeev recently joined the likes of Vijai Singh and K.J. Choi as an honorary member of the Asian Tour for his contribution to golf in the region and across the globe. (PTI)

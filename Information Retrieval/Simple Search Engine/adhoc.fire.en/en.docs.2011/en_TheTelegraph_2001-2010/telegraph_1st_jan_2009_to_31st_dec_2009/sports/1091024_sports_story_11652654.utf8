The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Viru made to fall in line 
                                                   Viru made to fall in line 
                      
	Virender Sehwag is a free man, except (or so it seems) when hes in the blue colours of Team India.         
	Indeed, a chained Sehwag got into an argument with Ms Gagandeep Gambhir (DCP, North) when, after Fridays nets, he was prevented by security personnel from leaving the Reliance Cricket Stadium alone.         
	You may have a separate vehicle, but my instructions are that every single player will come and go in the team bus... I wont allow you to leave individually, Ms Gambhir said rather firmly.         
	To that, Sehwag responded: But this is a free country and its my own country... You can stop visiting players, not me... This is just not done...         
	Ms Gambhir, though, was unmoved and Sehwag had to leave with the rest of Team India  a good half-an-hour after hed been ready to depart for the Taj-run The Gateway Hotel.         
	There have been instances of players either leaving all alone or in a small group, after training sessions, but security has now been taken to quite another level.         
	Its because the first anniversary of 26/11 is around the corner... As part of the security measures, for example, no vehicle is being allowed to come anywhere near the porch of the hotel... This time, no matter what, non-residents arent being allowed entry, a source told The Telegraph.         
	Even the hotels staff are feeling suffocated. Security personnel are everywhere... We havent been informed why, but the arrangements have taken on a different shape this time, somebody senior pointed out.         
	The states chief minister, Narendra Modi, who is also the Gujarat Cricket Association president, is understood to have taken personal interest in the security measures for Sundays India versus Australia ODI.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Can win without Viru, Zaheer: Bhajji
                                                     Can win without Viru, Zaheer: Bhajji
                  Harbhajan                     
	New Delhi: India will sorely miss Virender Sehwag and Zaheer Khan in next months tri-series in Sri Lanka but the presence of match-winners and the balance of the team still make them the tournament favourites, Harbhajan Singh said Monday.         
	Sehwag is a key player. Any team in the world would miss a player like him. But now that he would not be playing, we would have to do well without him, Harbhajan said.         
	He said the return of veterans Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid would offset Sehwags loss.         
	We are a strong team and its a balanced side. Besides, we have a number of match-winning players in the ranks. We have the youngsters and then you have experienced players like Dravid, Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh. If we play to our potential, we would return with this lovely trophy, he remarked.         
	Zaheer is an experienced bowler and its unfortunate that he would not be playing. We are going to miss him, Harbhajan said. However, Ashish Nehra, RP Singh, Praveen Kumar and Ishant Sharma have been doing well and they will have to step up and deliver.         
	Overall, we have got enough talent and we did well against New Zealand and also in Sri Lanka. Over the last two years, we have beaten every side. We just need to play to our potential to win the tri-series.         
	Its an important series for us because right after that, we play the ICC Champions Trophy, which is a big event for us, he said. (PTI)

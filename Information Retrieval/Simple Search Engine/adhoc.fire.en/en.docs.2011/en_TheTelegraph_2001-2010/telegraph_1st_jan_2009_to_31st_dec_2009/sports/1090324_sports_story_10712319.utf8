The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murray no match for Nadal
                                                   Murray no match for Nadal
                      
	Indian Wells: Rafael Nadal won with his powerful groundstrokes  and with an excellent plan.         
	Adjusting to playing in swirling winds that made it difficult even to toss the ball up to serve, Nadal breezed to a 6-1, 6-2 victory over Andy Murray in the BNP Paribas Open on Sunday for his second Indian Wells title in three years.         
	The conditions today were really difficult. But I think I had a good strategy and played a really good match under the conditions, Nadal said. Probably Andy didnt play his best because of the conditions, but I think I played a really complete match, moving very well.         
	I never stopped the legs during the match and I think that was the key. Maybe I accepted the conditions a little bit better than him. Maybe I had a little bit more positive attitude than him.         
	Like Nadal, Vera Zvonareva adapted better to the on-and-off gusts than did her opponent, beating defending champion Ana Ivanovic 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 in the womens final.         
	Zvonareva added the singles trophy to the one she won in doubles with Victoria Azarenka a day earlier.           (AP)

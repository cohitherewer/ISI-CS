The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warne praise for Warner 
                                                   Warne praise for Warner 
                      
	Melbourne: Test great Shane Warne Monday joined in the chorus along with former Australia skipper Bill Lawry in demanding the inclusion of wonderkid David Warner in the ODI squad with an eye on the Ashes series.         
	Warner made everybody sit up and notice with his high octane 43-ball 89 for Australia that bamboozled South Africa in the international Twenty20 match Sunday.         
	Id add him to the ODI squad immediately. What we saw last night was a player who can take the game away from the opposition in a handful of overs. I know he has played only once but you can see his capacity, he said. (PTI)

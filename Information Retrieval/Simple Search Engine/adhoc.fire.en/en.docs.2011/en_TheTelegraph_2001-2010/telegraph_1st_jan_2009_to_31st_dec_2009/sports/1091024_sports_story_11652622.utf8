	Kozhikode: The Chirag United juggernaut rolls on. The Calcutta side, yet to lose a match in this seasons I-League, beat Viva Kerala 1-0 in a third round match Friday.         
	Edmilson Marquez, Chirags new Brazilian recruit, came good again, scoring the all-important goal in the third minute. The early strike had the hosts batting on a sticky wicket and well they were  bang in the middle of the ground was a cricket pitch.         
	This was Viva Keralas first home match and the stand was occupied by a partisan crowd willing the team to win. But all that moral support came to nought. Despite valiant efforts by Viva Kerala, the scoreline remained unchanged, thanks to the all-round domination of Chirag.         
	Meanwhile, an injury time goal helped Dempo to hold a ten man Mahindra United to a 2-2 draw in a fourth round match at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda Friday.         
	Dempo went ahead in the 12th minute through a penalty from Ranty Martins. Mahindra fought back in the second half and equalised through substitute Svetozar Mijin in the 61st minute.         
	Steven Dias put Mahindra in the lead three minutes later and it was Dempos turn to fight back. They did, and equalised in stoppage time through Climax Lawerence. Both teams have 8 points from four outings with Dempo continuing at the top of the table on better goal difference.         
	In Ludhiana, JCT squandered an early lead to earn only a point from their match versus the Churchill Brothers, drawing 1-1 in another fourth round match Friday.         
	After a barren first half, the hosts took the lead in the 68th minute when defender Baljit Singh Sahni found the back of the net. JCT managed to hang on to the lead till the 88th minute, when Churchills R. Vashum struck for the visitors.

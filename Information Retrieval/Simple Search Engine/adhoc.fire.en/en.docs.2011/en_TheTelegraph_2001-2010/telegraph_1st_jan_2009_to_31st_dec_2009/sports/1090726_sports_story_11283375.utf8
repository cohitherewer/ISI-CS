                                                   WI may leave out stars for Trophy
                      
	St Johns: Leading West Indian cricketers, including captain Chris Gayle, might have to sit out of the Champions Trophy in September as the countrys board has decided to stick to the original 30-man provisional squad which didnt have their names.         
	The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) said the 30 players announced earlier for the Champions Trophy would remain, despite the end of the West Indies Players Association (WIPA) strike which had resulted in the top players missing the ongoing Bangladesh series in protest.         
	This would mean that top players like Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Dwayne Bravo, besides Gayle, who were the leading lights of the pay dispute strike could miss the September 22 to October 5 tournament.         
	Fast bowler Fidel Edwards and Darren Powell however, made the cut. to the 30-man preliminary squad made up of inexperienced players.         
	This squad was chosen from among those players who declared themselves available for selection for the tournament within the deadline date for finalisation of the 30, a WICB media release said.         
	Selection of players by the selection committee of the WICB will at all times be made from the pool of players who make themselves available for selection and based on performance, conduct and demonstrated commitment to West Indies cricket.         
	None of the striking players were included in the ODI squad against Bangladesh, which will be captained by 36-year-old Barbadian Floyd Reifer with Darren Sammy as his deputy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians get draw boost
                                                   Indians get draw boost
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: India received a favourable draw after Somdev Dev Varman was pitted against Chinese Taipeis No.2 player Ti Chen in the opening singles of the Davis Cup tie in Kaohsiung on Friday.         
	Rohan Bopanna will be up against Yen-Hsun Lu, the hosts No.1 player with a world ranking of 59, in the second singles on Friday while Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi would take on Tsung-Hua Yang and Chu-Huan Yi in the doubles match on Saturday.         
	In the reverse singles on Sunday, Dev Varman, the first Indian to break into top-150 in world singles rankings since Paes, will play Lu in the first match and Bopanna will play against Chen in the final game of the Asia-Oceania group one second round clash.         
	Indias fortunes revolve around Dev Varman as he is the key singles player due to the non-availability of Prakash Amritraj following the governments Indian citizens only rule.         
	The Assam-born Dev Varman did not have the best of draws against Romania last year. Being the teams No. 2 player, the 24-year-old was drawn against the seasoned Victory Hanescu.         
	But against Chinese Taipei, whom India are playing for the first time, he has a better chance against the 365th ranked Chen.         
	Two different ties in different situations. But this is the draw we were hoping for. Hopefully I can beat Chen and that will help Rohan as it will put Lu under a lot of pressure and Rohan can play more freely, Dev Varman told The Telegraph from Kaohsiung.         
	Dev Varman, however, is a little short on match practice as he has played only five matches since the Australian Open. The tie will be played on outdoor hard courts.

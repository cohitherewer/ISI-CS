                                                   Sourav likely in CAB working committee
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly, who has expressed a desire to get into cricket administration, is likely to find a place in the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB)s working committee when it is newly constituted after the annual general meeting.         
	The working committee comprises 40 members and each one is appointed on a rotation basis for two years.         
	If no club nominates the former India captain, he may be co-opted in the committee. There is a provision to co-opt one member.         
	It is now almost certain that Sourav wont contest for the CAB presidents post this year. The joint secretarys post may, however, see an election where Sujan Mukherjee may seek to challenge the current incumbents.         
	Sourav can give a new dimension to Bengal cricket But may be the time is not appropriate yet. He wants to be sure about the numbers before throwing his hat into the ring. He may contest next year, said an opposition member.         
	Meanwhile, the working committee meets on Saturday to decide the dates for the AGM and the annual awards ceremony. The annual report and accounts will also be placed before the committee.

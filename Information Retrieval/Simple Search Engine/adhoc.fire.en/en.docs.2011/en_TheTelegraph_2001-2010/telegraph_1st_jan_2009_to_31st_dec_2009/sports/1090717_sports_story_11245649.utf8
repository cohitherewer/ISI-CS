The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warne praise for Freddie
                                                     Warne praise for Freddie
                  Andrew Flintoff                     
	London: Shane Warne Thursday said world cricket would be poorer following Andrew Flintoffs decision to quit Tests after the ongoing Ashes series, describing Andrew Flintoff as an entertainer.         
	With Freddie, the loss will go beyond just England. World cricket will be poorer, too, although its great that he is continuing at one-day and Twenty20 levels, Warne said.         
	People remember him not only for his runs and wickets in 2005, but also for the way he played. He is one of the good guys, an entertainer who knows about the spirit of the game, wrote the Australian in a newspaper column.         
	Warne also felt Flintoff would have a good time playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL) for the Chennai Super Kings.         
	He will be great in the IPL next year and for as long as he plays in the competition. Hes not played for Chennai Super Kings in India yet, but I know that they will love him. Twenty20 suits his style. It is intensive, but not too long. He will hit some long balls and bowl some fast ones. Its simple, really  hes just a very good cricketer, said the Rajasthan Royals captain.         
	Warne felt Flintoffs body must have gone through a lot of wear and tear that was too much for him at the end.         
	Flintoffs body has gone through so many stresses and strains. It is a hard life being a fast bowler and the injuries have probably just worn him down like water pounding on a rock, Warne said. Other priorities  children and family  will be at the forefront of his mind as well as the good of the team. I consider myself a good mate and wish him all the best.         
	Former England captains Nasser Hussain and Michael Vaughan, too, were effusive in their praise for Flintoff. Vaughan, under whose leadership England regained the Ashes in 2005 after 18 years with Flintoff playing a crucial role with both bat and ball, said the all-rounder gave him the most management headaches but said it was all worth the pain.         
	He caused me to have more management meetings than anybody else in my time as England captain, such as when he missed the team bus or caught the wrong boat. But the match-turning, series-winning performances that he put in more than outweighed the odd difficulty he caused. No praise can be too high for him, Vaughan wrote in his column.         
	The former captain, who announced his retirement from all forms of the game after he was ignored for the Ashes, said England would miss Flintoffs personality.         
	His charismatic personality is what England will miss most. There is nobody else in this country  nobody else in world cricket perhaps  who can transform a team and a crowd like he does, Vaughan claimed.         
	Hussain said it was a joy captaining Flintoff for he would always give of his best.         
	He is a genuine national icon. You can see that at any ground when he walks on to bat or runs in to bowl. He is the man the public will pay good money to watch. He has made cricket in this country a box-office business again, Hussain wrote in a newspaper column.         
	From my experience, he was a joy to play with, because in every game, he was totally committed yet went about his work with a smile on his face. Supporters love the fact that he is such a whole-hearted competitor and I loved that trait when I was captaining him. He would run in all day for you.         
	On the 2001 series in India, Hussain said Flintoff would bowl his heart out every time the team needed him.         
	When we were on flat pitches in India, without a number of leading players, he bowled his heart out for me. He did whatever was needed to help the team. If I asked him to rough up Sachin Tendulkar, he would do it. If I asked him to get stuck into Sourav Ganguly again, he would do it. There were never any complaints.         
	In many ways, Freddie is the typical English hero because he gives everything when hes playing and enjoys himself, but hes never been a fitness fanatic and he loves a pint. People can relate to him as a character. He has failings but he throws body and soul into everything he does, Hussain said.

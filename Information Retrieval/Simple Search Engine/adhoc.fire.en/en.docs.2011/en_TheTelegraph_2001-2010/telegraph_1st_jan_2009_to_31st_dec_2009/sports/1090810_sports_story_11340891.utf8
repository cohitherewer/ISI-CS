            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: PK Banerjee is upset over the way his name has been dragged into a controversy by some of his teammates of the 1956 Olympic team.         
	Banerjee, who led India in the 1960 Rome Olympics, said he was hurt that a particular member of the team went public to make some uncomplimentary remarks against him without checking the facts.         
	The controversy started when some members of the 1956 Olympic football team were irked by the manner the All India Football Federation (AIFF) sent them Rs 25,000 each as grants and decided to return the cheques.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph, he said: I returned the money to the AIFF immediately after my colleagues in the 1956 team approached me. By that time I did deposit the cheque in my bank but I immediately issued another cheque and sent it to the AIFF.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | DareDevils overcome the Royals
                                                   DareDevils overcome the Royals
                      
	Bloemfontein: A disciplined bowling attack backed A.B. de Villierss unbeaten half century as the Delhi DareDevils defeated the Rajasthan Royals by 14 runs to consolidate their position at the top of the table in the Indian Premier League here Sunday.         
	Electing to bat first, the DareDevils rattled up a challenging 150 for three, largely due to De Villierss unbeaten 55-ball 79 and then restricted the Royals to 136 for nine to register their ninth win from 12 matches. DareDevils are sitting pretty at the top of the IPL table with 18 points in their kitty, while Royals, with 13 points from as many matches, are at fifth.         
	Meanwhile, the IPL technical committee, on the basis of a report provided by a cricket bowling specialist and biokineticist, has allowed the Royals to retain Amit Singh in their squad. However, if reported again the Royals pacer will be restricted from playing for 1 year.

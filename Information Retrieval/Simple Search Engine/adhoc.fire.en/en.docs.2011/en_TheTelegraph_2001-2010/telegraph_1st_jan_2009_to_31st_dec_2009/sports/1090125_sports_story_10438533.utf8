	Calcutta: Subhas Bhowmick, the newly appointed coach of East Bengal, failed to bring the Midas touch to the club as their dismal show in the I-League continued Saturday with a barren draw against United SC.         
	The red and gold brigade had lost their last three matches in the I-league under Stanley Rozario and finished a lowly seventh at the end of the first leg. The team, though, looked no different in Bhowmicks first match as coach.         
	In fact, East Bengal might consider themselves lucky to have snatched a point after they came perilously close to conceding but for United striker Sankar Oraons poor finishing.         
	East Bengal had the lions share of the possession throughout the match but their city counterparts had the better chances.         
	Four minutes before half time, Oraon got the ball after Nirmal Chetris defensive blunder. The United marksmans push past an advancing East Bengal goalkeeper Subrata Paul was off target.         
	Fifteen minutes before the final whistle, Oraon dribbled past two East Bengal defenders but again shot wide from an advantageous position. In their first match of the I-League, East Bengal had defeated United SC 3-1 at the Barasat Stadium.         
	The East Bengal midfield looked a bit off-colour on the day and the wing-play also left a lot to be desired. Sanju Pradhan and Rennedy Singh swapped flanks a number of times but failed to make any meaningful impact on the game. Sunil Chetri, however, came close to scoring on a couple of occasions. In one instance, his pile driver from about 25 yards out came off the crosspiece. The India strikers shot, in the 63rd minute, off a brilliant pass from Yusif Yakubu, demanded a superb save from the United goalkeeper Somnath Khara.         
	East Bengal coach Bhowmick started the match with only one foreigner in Yakubu. But he brought on his other foreigners  Suley Musah and Ismael Addo  in the second half.A desperate Bhowmick brought on Musah as the right-back to allow Syed Rahim Nabi push upfront, but his move didnt bear fruit.         
	United coachs boys played with simple tactics. They defended well and waited to catch their mightier opponents on the counter attack.

	United SC: Somnath Khara, Louis Nigi Ebami, Bidemi Daniel, Gouranga Dutta (Dulal Biswas 81), Arnab Mondal, Gautam Debnath, Hardeep Singh, Narugopal Hait, Denson Devdas (Lalmalsawma Hamar 69), M. Subhas Singh (Sasthi Duley 36), Sankar Oraon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ana crashes out
                                                   Ana crashes out
                      
	Tokyo: Former World No. 1 Ana Ivanovics alarming slump was prolonged by Czech Lucie Safarova in the first round of the Pan Pacific Open on Sunday.         
	The Serbs 6-4, 7-6 defeat at the $2 million Tokyo event follows her first-round exit from the US Open earlier this month, underlining a mystifying loss of form.         
	I know how Ana is feeling and I feel it with her, a sympathetic Safarova said.         
	Shes struggling with her serve and when that goes, all your game goes.         
	Safarovas win was arguably the highlight of a low-key opening day at the lucrative Pan Pacific Open, featuring nine of the worlds top 10 women.         
	World No. 1 Dinara Safina, last years Tokyo winner, second seed Venus Williams and French Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova begin their campaigns on Monday.         
	Japans Kimiko Date Krumm will get little time to savour winning her first WTA Tour title in 13 years in Seoul on Sunday as the wildcard is also in action on Monday, her 39th birthday.         
	Ninth seed Flavia Pennetta was the first of the top 10 players to fall in Tokyo, bundled out unceremoniously by fellow Italian Roberta Vinci 6-1, 6-2.           (REUTERS)

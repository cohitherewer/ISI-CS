            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mahindra United maintained their impressive form to hand a 3-1 thrashing to Air India in a 19th round I-League match here Saturday.         
	Edeh Chidi struck twice in the first half and Sushil Kumar Singh added to the tally in the second to make it a comprehensive performance for coach Derrick Pereiras boys at the Cooperage.         
	Kailash Patil scored the consolation goal for Air India a few seconds from time.         
	Air India began confidently but failed to capitalise on the chances that came their way.         
	Chidi opened the scoring for Mahindra in the 24th minute, heading home a Steven Dias cross, and increased the lead six minutes later through another header, again, from a Dias cross.         
	The third goal from Sushil Kumar, also from a header with Dias playing provider again, 10 minutes into the second half sealed the issue effectively.         
	The result means Mahindra have strengthened their hold on the fourth spot on the league table with 27 points.         
	Air India, who have now gone 12 matches without a win, stay at ninth with 20 points, just two more than JCT and Vasco who are in the drop zone.         
	Thankfully we have had luck going our way in the second half of the season, Pereira said of his sides resurgence.         
	Pereira refused to credit any one player for the teams revival.         
	Its a team effort and they have played committed football, he said.

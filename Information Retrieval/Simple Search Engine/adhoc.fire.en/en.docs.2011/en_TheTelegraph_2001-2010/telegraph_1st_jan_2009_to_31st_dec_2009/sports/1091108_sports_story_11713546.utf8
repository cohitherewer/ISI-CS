                                                                                                                                     Hussey: Hope to seal the series
  - It may be a good toss to lose, feels Australian vice-captain         OUR CORRESPONDENT            Shane Watson and Ricky Ponting during a practice session in Guwahati on Saturday                                 
	Guwahati: Australian vice-captain Michael Hussey said at a media conference Saturday that injuries to key players before and during the current series has provided the team with an opportunity to test the depth of the available talent back home going into the 2011 World Cup.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Sundays match after the victory in Hyderabad         
	It was a very tight match. It was a very difficult match for us the other night. It was pretty warm and hot. It took a lot out of us physically and mentally. That is why we had a recovery session today. We have plenty of motivation... We are 3-2 up and will play to win. We hope to seal the series here.         
	The injuries in the ongoing series         
	It is good to give opportunities to new guys because there have been injuries along the way in the series, which have been very disappointing. Opportunities have been given to new guys... An opportunity to show how good they can be. It gives us an opportunity to test our depth going and looking forward to the World Cup. It is good to have as many as guys as possible with experience in international cricket.         
	Whether Mitchell Johnson will play         
	I hope so but am not sure.         
	How (if batting first) will they tackle the first 10-12 overs in seaming conditions         
	Havent played here before. I dont know what would be the best thing to do. May be it will be a good toss to lose. I have never played here and so dont know much about the conditions. I guess the first 10 overs will be crucial. If we bat first, we will have to bat well. If we bowl first, we will have to bowl well. Whatever we do first, we will have to do well... We can cash in on the hard work later.         
	On all-rounder Shane Watson         
	He works very hard at his game. He is very professional. For the balance of the team, he is an important player Surely an important cog in our wheel.         
	The pitch         
	I am not sure. It looks like a good pitch. It will be very competitive. It should be a very good game.         
	Sachin Tendulkars knock in Hyderabad         
	It was a fantastic innings. It is always a pleasure to watch him. He found the gaps, cleared the boundaries pretty well. I am glad we got him out when we did.         
	The Indian team         
	They have quite a few match winners. We cannot take anyone lightly.         
	On the pressure to retain the No. 1 team tag         
	There is always pressure in international cricket. It would be nice to remain the No. 1 team. The one thing that motivates us is to try and win this series against India.

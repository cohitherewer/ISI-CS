	 Buenos Aires: Diego Maradona told Juan Roman Riquelme and River Plate coach Nestor Gorosito to keep their mouths shut on Friday in a growing spat between the Argentina coach and the former captain.

	True to his confrontational style, Maradona warned Riquelme in an interview published in the daily Clarin on Friday not to tarnish my name because I have more wit and cunning than he does, while also threatening to spill private details about Gorosito because I know (him) well and Im tough when it comes to getting the damage done.

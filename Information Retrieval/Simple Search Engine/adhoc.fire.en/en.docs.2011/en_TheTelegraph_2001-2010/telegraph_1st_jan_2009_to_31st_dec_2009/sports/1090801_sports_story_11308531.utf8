                                                                                                               Colourful Lady fancied 
            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Going was tough for punters in the month of July, but things are expected to work to their advantage now as form of the horses seems to be settling down. Therefore, it may pay to follow favourites in Saturdays seven-event card, featuring the 1,400m Great Tribute Cup. There are nine horses in the line-up for the trophy but the four needing attention are Aristotle, Bold Reply, Desert Dust and Colourful Lady.          
	Among the four, the one who has the best credential to win is trainer Bharath Singhs Colourful Lady. The Burden Of Proof daughter has performed creditably in the winter classic and she has also done well during the last monsoon season. With in-form jockey Md Islam in the saddle, Colourful Lady may be able to beat Aristorle.

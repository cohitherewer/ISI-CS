                                                   Feels special to be part of history: Sachin
                      
	Hyderabad: Sachin Tendulkar on Friday described it as a special feeling to be a part of the team which created history by claiming a record 38 Ranji Trophy titles.         
	Mumbai cricket has had a terrific history and some terrific players have represented the state. It feels truly special to be part of history, Sachin said.         
	I would like to congratulate all my team members who really worked hard and they deserved every bit of it, he told reporters after the 243-run win against Uttar Pradesh at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.         
	Mumbai have done it for the 38th time. Wasim (Jaffer) mentioned that we made it to the finals on 42 occasions. Thats a great record to have, he added.         
	Coach Pravin Amre also basked in the glory. Amre never won the Ranji Trophy as a player, but in his three years as Mumbais coach he has won the Ranji title twice.         
	The journey was terrific. It is great to see that happiness on each and every face. The icing on the cake was sharing the moment with Sachin and Zaheer (Khan), and they also enjoyed the victory. Last evening we had a team dinner.         
	Sachin congratulated each and every member of the team for working hard and playing a part in winning the title.         
	He said, Zaheer and I only joined in the semi-finals, but you were the guys who made us win the title. He thanked me for putting in the hard work behind the scenes, and Wasim for leading from the front, Amre told a website.         
	The presence of Tendulkar in the dressing room was also a welcome relief.         
	Once Sachin was there my job was that of the caretaker, said Amre. He would communicate with the players more as he has tremendous passion for Mumbai and its cricket, and is always concerned about its welfare.         
	Even after the Saurashtra game he was there in the nets to boost our morale. So with him around I could be relieved and didnt need to cover every point. His presence was important.

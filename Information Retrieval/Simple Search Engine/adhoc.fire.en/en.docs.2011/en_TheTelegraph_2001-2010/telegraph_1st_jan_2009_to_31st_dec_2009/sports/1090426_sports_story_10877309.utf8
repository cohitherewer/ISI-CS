                                                   Zoran is the AIFF choice
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Gurgaon: Zoran Djordjevic of Churchill Brothers on Sunday will be the first foreign manager to receive the best coach award of the I-League.         
	The award will be given to the Serbian after the Super Cup tie at the Devi Lal Stadium, here on Sunday. Zoran is also the first foreign coach to win the I-League title.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph, Zoran said he was aware that no foreign coach in India could ever win the I-League.         
	I am not sure whether I will be in Churchill next season, but one would never be able to deny my contribution to Indian football. Under me, Churchill could realise their dream of winning the title.         
	The Serbian, however, said that credit should go to the players for the fine performance.         
	They (the players) were exceptionally good. The club officials, too, played a very positive role.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal not taking Baroda lightly
                                                   Bengal not taking Baroda lightly
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal have a relatively easy opponent in the semi-final of the Vijay Hazare Trophy when they face Baroda on Friday. Baroda are without their stars, Irfan Pathan, Yusuf Pathan and Munaf Patel, all of whom are with the Indian team in New Zealand.         
	Although Bengal had a close shave in the quarters, their two-wicket victory against Delhi, a decidedly tougher opponent, should provide them with the required confidence. Manoj Tiwary, who single-handedly bailed Bengal out against Delhi with an unbeaten 96, may once again be the fulcrum of the teams batting. We had good practice today (Thursday). But we will have to perform well in all departments to outclass Baroda, said Tiwary.         
	Wridhhiman Saha, Sreevats Goswami and captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla have to fire if the East Zone champions are to harbour any hopes of winning the Trophy. Similar is the case with the bowlers, as Ranadeb Bose and Ashok Dinda have been found wanting in their trade. Spinners Iresh Saxena and Ritam Kundu, though, were quite impressive against Delhi.         
	According to reports received here, the Bengal team management is hopeful of a better pitch, which may have something for the batsmen.         
	On other hand, Baroda, who qualified second, behind Mumbai, from the West Zone, will look to carry on the good work from the quarters, where they beat Hyderabad by seven wickets. Rakesh Solanki, Shailesh Solanki and Azharuddin Bilakhia were among runs in the last match while Ikram Zampawala grabbed four wickets.         
	But Baroda will benefit most from the fact that they have Paras Mhambrey as coach. Mhambrey, an ex-Bengal coach, knows most of the Bengal players like the back of his hand and will surely have a plan up his sleeve.         
	The other semi-final on Friday will be between Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh.

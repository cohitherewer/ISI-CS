The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Series win for Lanka
                                                     Series win for Lanka
                  Jayawardene                     
	Dambulla: Mahela Jayawardene scored a brilliant hundred to guide Sri Lanka to a series-clinching six-wicket victory in the third one-day International against Pakistan on Monday.         
	Victory gave the hosts an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series; their first ODI series win against Pakistan on home soil.         
	Jayawardene, the former Sri Lanka captain, who opened the innings after Sanath Jayasuriya fell sick, scored a sublime 123 as the hosts overhauled Pakistans 288 for eight with 21 balls to spare.         
	Jayawardene compiled a 202-run partnership for the first wicket with Upul Tharanga, who scored 76.         
	Jayawardenes century, an innings that was hampered at the end by painful leg cramps, was the 11th of his career and his first since 2007.         
	Pakistan hopes were briefly buoyed by the fall of three quick wickets  Sri Lanka sliding from 202 without loss to 212 for three.         
	However, skipper Kumar Sangakkara finished off the game with an unbeaten 37, adding 56 with Thilina Kandamby (32) for the fourth wicket.         
	Umar Akmal top-scored for Pakistan with a brisk 66 and elder brother Kamran chipped in with 45, sharing a 71-run second wicket partnership with skipper Younis Khan, who scored 44.         
	Pakistans lower order also rallied, with Shahid Afridi (32), Abdul Razzaq (30) and Naved-ul Hasan (30 not out) all contributing.         
	Sri Lanka had won the first two one-day Internationals by 36 runs and six wickets respectively.         
	This followed their first-ever Test series victory at home against the Pakistanis.

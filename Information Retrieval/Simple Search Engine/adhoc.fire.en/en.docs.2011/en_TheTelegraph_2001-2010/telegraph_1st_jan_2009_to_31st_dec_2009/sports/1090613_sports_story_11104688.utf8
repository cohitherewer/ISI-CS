                                                   Lawson not bitter, but regret will stay
  - Former coach feels lack of international cricket will hurt Pakistan         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	London: Much of Geoff Lawsons two-year contract as coach remained when the Pakistan Cricket Board sacked him.         
	That was last October, after an ODI tournament in Canada.         
	Even if the one-time quick was bitter then, today theres no more than a sense of regret.         
	Of course, theres regret... Always will be over the manner my tenure ended, Lawson, doing radio commentary in the ongoing World T20, told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking at Lords on Friday afternoon, he added: Ive met the boys here, though... Weve had a few good sessions together... I do follow Pakistans performances with a great deal of interest.         
	Asked just how badly would Pakistan be hit with no likelihood of international cricket there for quite some time, Lawson said: It will hurt because teams tend to win more at home and that lifts confidence. Also, series at home allow greater opportunities for younger players...         
	He couldnt have been more spot on.         
	Back in Australia, Lawson is engaged in private coaching, besides lecturing to-be Level II coaches.

	Nyon: Five clubs in Albania, Latvia, Slovenia and Hungary are suspected in European footballs biggest match-fixing investigation, Uefa said Wednesday.         
	 The European football body identified the clubs as KF Tirana, FC Dinaburg, KS Vilaznia, NK IB Llubljana and Honved and said they allegedly fixed seven qualifying round games in the Champions League and Europa League between July 16 and August 6.         
	Uefa general secretary Gianni Infantino described match-fixing as a cancer we need to eradicate.         
	He said the seven matches were among 40 in continental club competitions previously identified as being under suspicion.           (AP)

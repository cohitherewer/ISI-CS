The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ricky wants to return in 2013
                                                     Ricky wants to return in 2013
                  Ponting                     
	London: Australia captain Ricky Ponting remained defiant and hinted at coming back for the 2013 series even though his career hit a low with the second Ashes defeat on English soil Sunday.         
	Ponting became only the second Australian captain to lose twice in England  in 2005 and this year  since Billy Murdoch, who lost in 1884 and 1890. Ponting, who would be 38 in 2013, wants to use the defeats as inspiration.         
	Yep, it certainly does (make me want to return), Ponting told reporters after the 197-run defeat at the Oval. Well see how Im going in four years. Hopefully there will be another chance to play another Ashes series back in Australia. But it would be nice, with everything Ive done in my career and the games Ive played, to have some good memories from this ground. I might have to come back next time and find some.         
	The right-hander, who is Australias leading Test run-getter, will take a one-week break from international cricket before returning in the later half of the seven-match one-day series against England later this month.         
	Ponting said he was preparing to answer some tough questions on his return home.         
	Ill be answering some questions (when I get home). You always do when you lose a game or a series like this, its part of the job, what leaders are expected to do, he said.         
	But Ive never doubted myself in anything Ive ever done when Ive had the baggy green cap on. I always get out there and accept challenges the best that I can, he added.         
	Ponting refused to blame anyone in particular for the defeat, saying as captain, it was his responsibility to get the best out of his team.         
	Ultimately, its my responsibility to get the best out of the guys and to win the series. I felt I ticked most of those boxes, other than making a few more runs myself, the losing captain said.         
	Heckled by fans almost the entire series, Ponting said he was happy to get some applause in the final Test.         
	Freddie (Flintoff) said when I went out, he thought Id hired a PR company for this week to get a few supporters on my side, Ponting joked. It was nice to get an ovation.

  - Mahendra singh Dhoni and Co. to attend fund-raiser in city on Tuesday         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            The Men in Blue have agreed to support Vaani, a Deaf Childrens Foundation                                 
	Nagpur: Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men will be doing a good deed on Tuesday, the day they land in Calcutta, after the third ODI, in Cuttack.         
	Match No.4 will be at the Eden, two days after that.         
	The Men in Blue have agreed to support Vaani, a Deaf Childrens Foundation, by being present at a fund-raiser to be held over dinner at Taj Bengal.         
	Put in place four years ago by Brinda Crishna, Vaani is registered as a trust, with its head office in Calcutta. At the moment, its running projects in the North-East, particularly in Assam, Meghalaya and Mizoram.         
	According to former India opener Arun Lal, who approached the Dhonis on behalf of Vaani, some of the Sri Lankan cricketers are also expected to be present at the fund-raiser.         
	Sourav Ganguly, too, should be there.         
	Auction of memorabilia is on the cards... There may even be an interactive session with, say, Sachin Tendulkar, Lal told The Telegraph on Thursday.         
	Vaani had one fund-raiser in March, but the event was done very differently and on a much smaller scale.         
	The one on Tuesday is going to be our first real fund-raiser and were hopeful of a very handsome response, is how Sarika Batra, Vaanis fund raising officer, put it.         
	Dinner tables are being sold to raise funds. A table for ten, for example, can be booked for Rs 1 lakh. An individual booking would cost Rs 12,500.         
	All that would depend on availability, though.         
	The Calcutta Foundation and Steve Waugh introduced Calcuttans to fund-raising and the auctioning of memorabilia with a difference. Vaani is looking to take that forward.         
	Its interesting that the idea isnt only to raise funds, but bring about a greater awareness specific to the challenges faced by deaf children.

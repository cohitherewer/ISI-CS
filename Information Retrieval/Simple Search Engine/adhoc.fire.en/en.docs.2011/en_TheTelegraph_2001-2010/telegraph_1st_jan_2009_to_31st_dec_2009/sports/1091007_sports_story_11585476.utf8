                                                   Ponting: Its   a special achievement
            A CORRESPONDENT                            
	Johannesburg: Ricky Ponting was over the moon after his sides successful defence of their Champions Trophy title and, Shane Watsons heroics had the Australia captain gushing as he spoke to the media after the final at Centurion.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On Watsons innings         
	Were now seeing the real Shane Watson beginning with the Ashes, hes had a great few months. I think getting his opportunity to open the batting, which is a position he is not accustomed to, he played beautifully. And, now, sort of back at full fitness and being able to operate with the ball and at the top of the order with the bat, he is showing everybody just how good a cricketer he can be. To see those guys (Watson and Cameron White) stand up and get us across the line was very satisfying.         
	On the victory         
	Im ecstatic and well be having a big celebration. It feels great to come away with a win and to win a tournament as big as this one. Its the second biggest one-day tournament that you play So its a very special achievement.         
	The youngsters in the side         
	Its great to see now that we are getting a bit more experience in some of the young guys, they are starting to make a major impact on the international game. As Shane has over the last few days. Thats a really good sign for us. We pride ourselves on performances in big matches and in big tournaments. Someone mentioned the stat the other day about how many games we have actually lost in the last couple of World Cups and Champions Trophies  one game. Thats terrific.         
	Peter Siddles contribution in the campaign         
	I think he was probably just holding back a first couple of games, under a little bit of pressure. But we talked to him probably just released the reins on him a little bit. Told him to charge in and bang the ball into the wicket. The England game the other day, he got us the first breakthrough, he got Strauss, he got us the first breakthrough today (Monday). (Brendon) McCullum was a big wicket for us. So I think his performances in the last couple of games has been great.         
	The present tournament         
	Weve been in South Africa for two weeks and the tournament is over... The earlier editions would drag on... It had actually devalued the second biggest one-day tournament in the world. Weve got the best eight teams in the world playing for it. I think the ICC have gone out of their way to make little changes to the tournament, just little things that the players really enjoy. Full credit to them and full credit to South Africa for hosting such a fantastic tournament.         
	On the workload         
	I guess theres not much you can do about it, is there? The Champions League is scheduled right on top of this so they will fly out tomorrow (Tuesday) to India and play in a couple of days time. But I think one of the things we have managed to do very well over the last couple of years is look after player workloads and particularly fast bowlers workloads.         
	The relevance of the 50-over game         
	There has been a lot of talk about that since the 20-over game became as popular as it has. Theres certainly a place for both T20 and the 50-over game, but its Test cricket that I enjoy the most. 50-over cricket with tournaments like this will certainly hold its own.         
	New Zealands performance in the final         
	You have got to give a lot of credit to New Zealand for making it through to the final. Especially with some of the injuries theyve had during the tournament, it is a great effort. They performed very very well They lost early wickets but hung in there, gave themselves a chance full credit to the New Zealanders.

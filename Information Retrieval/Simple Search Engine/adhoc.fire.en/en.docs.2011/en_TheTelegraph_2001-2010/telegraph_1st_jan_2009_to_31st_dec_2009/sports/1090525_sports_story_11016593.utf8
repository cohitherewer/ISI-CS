	Paris: Defending champion Ana Ivanovic struggled on the important points in her opening match at the French Open before beating Sara Errani of Italy 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 on Sunday to reach the second round.         
	The eighth-seeded Serb converted only five of the 20 break points she earned against her opponent. Errani broke three times and even served for the first set at 5-4.         
	I knew I had to work hard for my points, and Im very happy I did that, Ivanovic said. And I kept my composure.         
	Ivanovic, who beat Dinara Safina in last year final, pulled out of this months Madrid Open with a knee injury, and her right knee was taped Sunday at Roland Garros. She finished the match with seven double-faults and six aces, while the 44th-ranked Errani did a good job of moving the defending champion all over the court.         
	Even though I had some time off during the Madrid tournament, I feel like it takes only few days to get back in shape, Ivanovic said.         
	Ivo Karlovic set a tour-level record for aces with 55 in his 6-7 (1-7), 6-7 (4-7), 7-6 (7-4), 6-4, 6-3 loss to Lleyton Hewitt. The 26th-seeded Karlovic, who has lost in the first round in 14 of his 24 Grand Slam appearances, broke the previous record of 51, which he shared with Joachim Johansson. The old mark for aces in a French Open match was 37, held by Andy Roddick in 2001. To play him on any surface, hes so dangerous, Hewitt said of Karlovic.         
	At Wimbledon in 2003, Hewitt lost to Karlovic to become the first man in the Open era to lose in the first round as defending champion at the All England Club.         
	Marat Safin, another of the eight former Grand Slam singles champions in the mens field, also advanced. The Russian beat Alexandre Sidorenko of France 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. Every round is a tough one, said Safin, who is planning to retire at the end of the season. Im trying but Im really suffering on the court right now. But Ill try to play better next match and I hope that I will get through.         
	Eighth-seeded Fernando Verdasco, No. 13 Marin Cilic of Croatia and No. 31 Nicolas Almagro of Spain also advanced.         
	Both Ivanovic and Errani questioned calls on the red clay, but Ivanovic was on the winning side of a crucial challenge in the tiebreaker. At 1-1 with Errani serving, the Italian hit a ball wide that Ivanovic returned. Errani then sent a winner to the other side of the court on her next shot and believed she had taken the lead, but Ivanovic called for the chair umpire, who checked the previous mark and overruled the call.         
	Errani stood at the net and complained, but the call stood and Ivanovic won the next two points on serve to take a 4-1 lead. The 21-year-old Ivanovic also reached the final at Roland Garros in 2007, and last years Australian Open final. She was the worlds top-ranked player for 12 weeks in 2008 but has dropped to No. 8.         
	I just have to keep my head down and work tough through the matches, Ivanovic said about her chances at this years French Open. No. 11 Nadia Petrova reached the second round by easily beating 18-year-old Lauren Embree of the United States 6-1, 6-2.         
	Also, 25th-seeded Li Na of China defeated Marta Domachowska of Poland 6-4, 6-2, 27th-seeded Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of Russia beat Ioana Raluca Olaru of Romania 6-3, 6-2, and 32nd-seeded Iveta Benesova of the Czech Republic advanced when Julia Goerges of Germany retired while trailing 7-5, 4-1.

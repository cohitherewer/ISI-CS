The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zlatan seals it for Barcelona
                                                                                                                       7                                        Zlatan seals it for Barcelona
                  Zlatan Ibrahimovic on Saturday                     
	Madrid: Zlatan Ibrahimovic smashed in a penalty to give La Liga leaders Barcelona a 1-0 home win over Espanyol on Saturday while Real Madrid kept pace at the top when Gonzalo Higuain struck twice in a 3-2 win at Valencia.         
	Champions Barca and second-placed Real were missing key players, with Lionel Messi out of the Catalan derby due to an ankle sprain and the suspended Cristiano Ronaldo and injured Kaka absent for the Valencia clash.         
	After a tight first half at the Mestalla, Reals Argentina striker Higuain broke the deadlock in the 54th minute with a header from Karim Benzemas cross before league top scorer David Villa equalised with his 12th of the season on the hour.         
	Marcelo set Higuain up to drive home his second five minutes later, Valencia substitute Joaquin made it 2-2 after 80 minutes and Real defender Ezequiel Garay, who replaced the injured Pepe just before the break, headed the winner three minutes later.         
	It was a very important victory against one of our direct rivals, Higuain said in a television interview.         
	Barcelona top the standings on 39 points from 15 matches, five ahead of Real who have a game in hand. Valencia are third with 28 and Sevilla are a further point back in fourth.         
	Higuains Argentina team mate Messi was injured in Wednesdays Champions League victory at Dynamo Kiev, but was in the Nou Camp earlier on Saturday to show the fans the Ballon dOr award he won this month.         
	His replacement, Pedro, fluffed a chance to put Barca ahead in the 14th minute when he robbed Francisco Chica but skewed his shot wide with Carlos Kamenis goal at his mercy.         
	Victor Valdes had to be alert to keep out Joan Verdus dipping strike seconds later before Kameni acrobatically palmed away Thierry Henrys low effort.         
	Sweden striker Ibrahimovic converted a penalty in the 39th, after Baena impeded Xavi, giving Kameni no chance with a drive high into the net for his 11th goal of the season.         
	Espanyol put up more of a fight in a scrappy second half but were unable to find an equaliser and Ibrahimovic and Gerard Pique went close to doubling Barcas lead.         
	Barca now travel to Abu Dhabi to take part in the World Club Cup where they will face Concacaf champions Atlante in the semi-finals on Wednesday.         
	They are bidding for a sixth trophy to go with their Spanish and European Champions League titles, the Kings Cup and the Spanish and European Super Cups.           (REUTERS)

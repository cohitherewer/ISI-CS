The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | South favourites vs depleted West
                                                     South favourites vs depleted West
                  Rahul Dravid                     
	Chennai: Nine-time champions South Zone start favourites to win the title after a gap of 13 years when they lock horns with a depleted West Zone in the five-day final of the Duleep Trophy here Thursday.         
	Led by S. Badrinath in the absence of an injured V.V.S. Laxman, South Zone look stronger as West would be without Zaheer Khan, Yusuf Pathan and Ravindra Jadeja, who are doing national duty in Sri Lanka.         
	Souths batting quartet of Rahul Dravid, Badrinath, Dinesh Karthik and R. Ashwin are in good nick. Dravid, in particular, is in great form with two centuries in two matches while Karthik has also scored two centuries against Central Zone.         
	Although they will be missing their main bowler, Lakshmipathy Balaji who is off to Sri Lanka as Munaf Patels replacement, the recovery of opening batsman Murali Vijay and pacer Shanthakumaran Sreesanth from injuries has given them a boost.         
	Balaji has been replaced by Robin DSouza from Goa in the Souths bowling attack but the team would depend on Sreesanth and leg-spinner M. Suresh who has claimed 12 wickets in two matches, to pick up wickets.         
	Obviously we will miss Balaji but we are planning to go in with five bowlers and if our batting fires, we would be in a strong position. The pitch looks dry and is likely to take turn as the match progresses, Badrinath said.         
	On the other hand, West Zone would rely on youngsters Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane, who have been consistent with the willow in both Ranji Trophy and the Duleep matches, besides captain Wasim Jaffer.         
	Both teams have strong batting line-ups and I feel the bowlers will make a difference. I am confident that we will do well in this match, said Jaffer.         
	West have so far won the trophy on 16 occasions while South have won the title on nine occasions.

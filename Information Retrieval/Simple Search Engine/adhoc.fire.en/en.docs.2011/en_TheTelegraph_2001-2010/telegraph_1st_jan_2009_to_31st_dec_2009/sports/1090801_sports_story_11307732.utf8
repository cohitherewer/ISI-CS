                                                   Baljit to head for the US 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Indian hockey goalkeeper Baljit Singh, who was hit with on the eye with a golf ball during the national teams practice in Pune, will be taken to the United States for treatment.         
	According to the Hockey India secretary Mohammed Aslam, the talented custodian, who is currently admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) here, will be flown to the US at the earliest.         
	It all depends on availability of the visa, Aslam said. The sports ministry will bear the entire cost (of the treatment). As soon as the formalities are over, Baljit will leave for the US, Aslam added.         
	An official from the sport ministry said Baljit could be send to the Johns Hopkins Hospital Institute in Baltimore.         
	Michael Phelps had also undergone treatment in the same hospital during his childhood.         
	An Indian Olympic Association (IOA) official, however, said it was yet to be finalised whether Baljit would be taken to Baltimore.

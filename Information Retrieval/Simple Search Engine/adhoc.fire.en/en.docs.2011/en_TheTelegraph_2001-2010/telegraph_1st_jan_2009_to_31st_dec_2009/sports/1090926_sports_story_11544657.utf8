The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Id like cricket to be the biggest winner: Younis 
                                                     Id like cricket to be the biggest winner: Younis 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Younis Khan during a media conference in Centurion on Friday. (AFP)                           
	Johannesburg: Pakistans match against India has got closer, but captain Younis Khan was as relaxed on Friday as hed been on Thursday when The Telegraph met him at the Sandton Sun.               
	The following are excerpts from Youniss media conference in neighbouring Centurion         
	Pressure associated with an India-Pakistan clash         
	Its there, but Ill be treating tomorrows game like any other match... If the team starts taking the pressure, then it could collapse... The key, then, is handling it.         
	Significance of the clash         
	Again, its a difficult time for Pakistan and we need some good wins... Winning the Champions Trophy would be great... The entire nation is behind both teams... At the end of the day, though, Id like cricket to be the biggest winner.         
	Whether its a revenge match for Pakistan, which lost to India in the 2003 World Cup, in Centurion         
	No... We need some good wins, thats it... This is sports and we wont be fighting out in the middle... In fact, youll find both (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni and I absolutely calm tomorrow...         
	Prospects         
	Every game starts 50-50, but conditions could make a difference.         
	His fitness         
	Im not 100 per cent there, but to get to that stage, Ill need four weeks... Ive avoided pain-killing injections... Ill play with this pain, for one has always done so... A little pain somewhere or the other.         
	Whether he wouldve played had the opposition not been India         
	(Laughs) No... Look, it wouldve been easy for me to run away from the India match, but Id like to play a captains innings... Id like to emulate Sachins performance (98) against us in the 2003 World Cup... Aaj bhi log baat karte rehte hain... It will be great if I can, say, score a hundred with a broken finger... Ive looked at the bigger picture and motivated myself to play through this pain.         
	Sachin factor         
	Hes not hovering around us like a ghost... Koi jinh-bhoot to nahin hain... We dont fear him... I think theres more pressure on Sachin as he doesnt have (Virender) Sehwag and Yuvraj (Singh) around... Having said that, theres so much to learn each time that he scores big. Dekhne mein achcha lagta hai.         
	Yuvrajs absence         
	Wouldnt say its good luck for us, rather its bad luck for India...         
	Dhoni as captain         
	Hes been doing a fantastic job and, with experience, is more mature and much calmer now... His performances have been improving day by day.         
	Whether youngsters like Mohammed Aamer and Umar Akmal will be able to handle the pressure         
	They dont know what pressure means and, so, thats good for the team... The experienced players feel the heat a lot more, not so the newcomers.         
	Having somebody of Intikhab Alams experience in the dressing room         
	Hes been around for so many years and thats of help... A team should have a mix of youth and experience... A senior group is essential.         
	Finally, the surface at Centurion         
	Usually, the wicket doesnt matter unless its soft, as it was this morning... With sunshine, it could be different when we see it before the toss. The same surface had been used for Thursdays South Africa-New Zealand clash.

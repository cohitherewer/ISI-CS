	Calcutta: Bengal vice-captain Manoj Tiwary, in all likelihood, will turn up for the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in the third edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	The Delhi DareDevils, whom Manoj had represented in the first two IPLs, were keen to swap Manoj with Ishant Sharma. However, the KKR didnt agree to the exchange. Manoj was bought by the Delhi franchise for $675,000.         
	It has been learnt that KKR will have to pay a fee to the DareDevils to for Manojs release.

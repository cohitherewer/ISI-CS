	Cape Town: Kolkata Knight Riders are the best-looking team in the Indian Premier League, feels principal owner Shah Rukh Khan. I dont know about cricket, but we are the coolest-looking team, the Bollywood star said here Wednesday.         
	Shah Rukh, a passionate cricket fan, said what added to his teams appeal is the fact that they are working on amazing and unprecedented plans.         
	We are working on amazing plans, including the one regarding captaincy, which has been creating a lot of controversy over the past few months. I think we are well prepared.         
	Unfortunately, we do have injuries but well be there, one hundred per cent, trying to do much better than last year, he added.         
	Shah Rukh, who had hit out at Sunil Gavaskar for the former India captains criticism of the multiple-captains theory, had apologised to the legendary batsman on Tuesday.         
	Suggesting Buchanans multiple-skipper theory did not deserve comment, Gavaskar had written in his syndicated column he has wangled for his Queensland pals and former teammates lucrative jobs with the franchise. The owners, poor souls, probably have little idea of how they are being milked.         
	Shah Rukh Khan was of the opinion that his team will be more competitive than the first edition of the IPL as more foreign players will be available this time.         
	The Calcutta franchisee made a blistering start last year, beating Royal Challengers Bangalore by 140 runs, but could not continue the momentum after foreign players like New Zealands Brendon McCullum and Australia captain Ricky Ponting left for national duty. KKR eventually finished sixth.         
	This year also, Ponting has decided to skip the IPL and has preferred to take rest before the forthcoming Ashes series, but Shah Rukh feels the availability of other international players will boost KKRs chances of a better finish.         
	Internationally, I think the players will be more available, Shah Rukh told a press conference after arriving here.         
	Well have Chris Gayle and McCullum, and then David Hussey will join us when Gayle leaves. Brad Hodge is here, and so is Sourav Ganguly. Everyone has been practising over the past 10 days.         
	Many expected KKR to buy some English players this time, but Shah Rukh said they are too expensive and beyond KKRs reach.         
	We have gold and black as a uniform, but the gold is not real, Shah Rukh quipped.         
	We are a poor team and English players are very, very expensive. We would have liked to buy them, but at the auction, its down to how much money you have.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murali may retire before 11 Cup
                                                                                                                       7                                        Murali may retire before 11 Cup
                  Muralidharan                     
	Colombo: Frustrated with his failure to provide Sri Lanka the breakthroughs in the ongoing Test series against India, Muttiah Muralidharan says he is no longer the dreaded bowler he used to be and might even retire completely before the 2011 World Cup.         
	Muralidharan, who has already announced his Test retirement after next years series against the West Indies, said he may walk into the sunset before the 2011 World Cup in the sub-continent. Sri Lanka is currently trailing 0-1 in the three-match Test series against India the final game of which starts December 2 in Mumbai.         
	I am 37 years old and I cant bowl as much as those days because after 15-16 overs I get tired. But I will try and play a little bit of one-day cricket thats only 10 overs to bowl. If I find everything is not going well I might retire from both forms of the game before the World Cup, Muralidharan said.         
	Everything depends on how much my body can take. My body may hold for one-day cricket because its a fifty-over game.         
	In Test cricket its a little bit harder because I have always been a threat to other sides. At the moment its not looking like that because others are playing me well. I think I made the right decision to retire from Test cricket at the end of the West Indies series next year, he was quoted as saying by a Sri Lankan daily.         
	Muralidharan said his body now struggles to respond to the demands of international crickets grind and time has come for Sri Lanka to look beyond him.         
	Two to three years ago it was not like this. Now you have niggles here and there and my groin is not the same as it used to be. We got the worst conditions of bowling in the last two Tests.         
	We didnt have the bowlers when we were bowling that was one of the factors. But thats the way cricket goes everything wont work for you in your favour, said Muralidharan, who needs just 12 wickets to become the first bowler with 800 Test wickets.         
	There was a time the team was dependent on me for wickets but it has to change. Others must also get a chance Rangana (Herath) is bowling well and (Ajantha) Mendis. They will have to carry through in the years to come.         
	Whatever I did in the last 18 years is not possible for anybody to achieve because I ran through sides alone getting five-for in an innings 66 times and 22 ten-wicket match hauls.         
	One single spinner cannot achieve that but as a collective unit of bowlers they can take wickets against oppositions. We have fast bowlers and spinners and they are good enough to do that.         
	Muralidharan, who is on his fourth and last tour of India, has been struggling to come to terms with the placid Indian pitches and the hosts strong batting line-up which has treated him harshly in the series so far.           (PTI)

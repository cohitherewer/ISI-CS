The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI to reconsider decision
                                                   BCCI to reconsider decision
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India on Thursday said it was reconsidering its decision to drop the zonal one-day tournament for the Deodhar Trophy for the 2009-10 domestic season.         
	We are trying to squeeze in the Deodhar Trophy somewhere, BCCI chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty told reporters on Thursday.         
	The IPL starts on March 18 and we want to complete the domestic calendar four-five days before that. There is a proposal to have the zonal Twenty20 simultaneously with Champions League and have the all-India knock out towards the end of the season.         
	We are still working it out. The working committee meeting in August will finalise the calendar.         
	The BCCIs volte face came after a group of Shiv Sena activists demonstrated here, protesting the move of drop.

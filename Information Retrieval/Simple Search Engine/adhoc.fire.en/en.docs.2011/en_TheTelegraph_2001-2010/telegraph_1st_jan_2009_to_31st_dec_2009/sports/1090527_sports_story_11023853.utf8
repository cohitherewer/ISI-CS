The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Evra is ready for tough test 
                                                   Evra is ready for tough test 
                      
	Paris: Manchester United defender Patrice Evra is bracing himself for the biggest test of his career against Barcelonas Lionel Messi in Wednesdays Champions League final, and fears one mistake could cost his team dearly.         
	The lighting quick Argentina forward has scored freely this season and is considered Barcas most creative and dangerous attacker against Alex Fergusons side, which is looking to defend their title and win the European Cup for a fourth time.         
	It will be a difficult night for me. I know that. I have a lot of respect for him (Messi), but I am relaxed and confident, Evra said in Tuesdays edition of sports daily LEquipe.         
	I know whats in store for me. If I win 20 battles against him, (but) he gets past me once and he scores, theyll say that I messed up. quot;Ferguson said: Messi? Pat will take care of it. I hope I dont let him down. quot;         
	Messi failed to score against Uniteds defence in last seasons Champions League semi-final, but Evra expects a different challenge this time.         
	The 21-year-old scored 23 league goals to help Barcelona win the Spanish title, and his cushioned pass deep into injury time in the semi-final against Chelsea landed perfectly for Andres Iniesta to score the equaliser that sent Barca through to the final in Rome on away goals.         
	People talk about the two matches last season in the Champions League, when I won my battle against him, but Messi is not the same player, Evra said.         
	Evra joined United from Monaco in 2006, and after a difficult first season adapting to the rigours of the Premier League he has since become a mainstay in Fergusons team, making the left side of defence his own.         
	The 28-year-old France defender says he has learned all about Uniteds winning mentality from players like Ryan Giggs and Wayne Rooney, because they never moan if they are left out by Ferguson and always put the team first.         
	Here you have legends like Giggs who find themselves in the stands ... and the guy is still there in the changing room, getting right behind the team. Its the first time Ive seen that. It rubs off on everyone, Evra said. Fergusons the one who brought in this culture. If youre not like that, you exclude yourself from the squad by yourself. When Rooney scores Im not even sure hes happy, Evra added.         
	He doesnt care about his ego, what interests him is running, tackling, helping the team. Evra will be playing in his third Champions League final after losing with Monaco in 2004.I want a second (title). And a third. That is my objective, Evra said. Three (titles), like my shirt number.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Terror at home is affecting Pak players
                                                   Terror at home is affecting Pak players
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	London: Pakistan captain, Younis Khan, has conceded that the terror strikes back home have affected his players and staying focused is a challenge.         
	At this moment, theres nothing thats good in Pakistan and, so, winning the World T20 would be great, he pointed out on Thursday evening.         
	Pakistans opening Super Eight encounter, against Sri Lanka, is at Lords on Friday.         
	Younis added: Its very hard on us... Were human beings and get affected... The other day, there was such a big incident in Peshawar, from where I come... Having said that, one has to play both in a good and bad state of mind. Such is life...         
	Elaborating on his own approach, Younis stated: I laugh even when we lose, because thats the way I am... Im a simple person... If you do the right things, nobody will go after you.         
	Clearly, Younis is on a mission, one which almost got derailed after the defeat at the hands of England.         
	Koi jyada pressure nahin tha... In fact, I wasnt under any pressure before the match versus The Netherlands, which we had to win. Main confident tha, he told The Telegraph.         
	Asked to sum up T20, Younis replied with a grin: Koi favourite nahin hota... The one who clicks carries the day... Lag gaya to chal gaya... Its challenging.         
	For Pakistan, the first of the big challenges is in the form of Sri Lanka.

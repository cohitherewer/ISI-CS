                                                     Harendra: Glad we silenced critics
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Sandeep Singh upon arrival in New Delhi on Monday. (AFP)                           
	New Delhi: Indian hockey teams coach in-charge Harendra Singh has had plenty to be happy about at the end of the Azlan Shah hockey tournament in Malaysia.         
	Speaking from Ipoh a day after beating hosts Malaysia in the final, the India coach said that it was the attitude of the boys that satisfied him more than the title after 13 years.         
	It was certainly a memorable victory, Harendra said. But my biggest satisfaction was that I could ignite the passion in the boys. My players were aware of their duty. This win was the result of my players will to take Indian hockey ahead.         
	My team was written off by the so called experts. They all said that Indian hockey was finished. I am happy that my boys could turn around and prove them wrong.         
	Harendra said the performance of his captain, Sandeep Singh had been exceptional throughout the tournament.         
	I have been saying from day one that Sandeep is not a mere match-winner. He is a tournament winner, said Harendra. The boy has proved me right in this tournament. Out of the 12 goals we scored, six were struck by Sandeep.         
	Sandeep Singh, it may be recalled, had earlier said that there was no need of a foreign coach for the national team.         
	The Indian team manager Dhanraj Pillay also expressed similar views on Sunday and said a full-time foreign coach was not needed.         
	Harendra also praised the ad hoc committee on hockey and the selection committee for their support and selection of the team. I must say the selection committee picked the perfect team.         
	When they are in a tough situation they keep battling and never give up. My boys played well together. They have great chemistry.         
	Harendra said his aim was to put India among the top-six teams in the world. Thats the way I planned at the start of the season. Now we are ranked ninth. We should be able to finish among the top six by the end of the year.         
	Azlan Shah was only the beginning. We should be able to do better in the near future.

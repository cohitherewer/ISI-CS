                                                   Alls fair in love and cricket: Shilpa
                      
	Cape Town: Rajasthan Royals co-owner Shilpa Shetty feels it would be an emotional encounter when her team takes on Shah Rukh Khans Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League (IPL) match here on Thursday.         
	Shilpa considers Shah Rukh as one of her friends and feels the match would be emotionally taxing for her.         
	We play on the 23rd next in Cape Town against the Knight Riders. That will be a difficult one. Not the match but the emotion, Shilpa wrote on her blog.         
	The Bollywood actor, whose team lost the opening encounter against Bangalore Royal Challengers, feels though it would be difficult to play against a friends team, as far as cricket was concerned, its all fair and square.         
	Its terrible to play against a friends team but alls fair in love and cricket I guess, she wrote.         
	Shilpa and Raj Kundra have bought 11.7 per cent stake in the franchise this year. She has been a regular at all their matches so far.           (PTI)

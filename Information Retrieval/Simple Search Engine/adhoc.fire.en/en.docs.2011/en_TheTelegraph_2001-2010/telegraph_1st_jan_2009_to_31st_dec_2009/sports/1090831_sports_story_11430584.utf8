                                                   Bolt: I can run faster
                      
	Madrid: Usain Bolt, who took part in a ceremonial kick-off celebrating the start of the Spanish league at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium this weekend, said Sunday he can improve on his record times of 9.58 seconds in the 100 metres and 19.19 in the 200.         
	I think I can go faster, but I leave that up to my coach, Bolt said.         
	Bolt said he has become a fan of the team since Ruud van Nistelrooy moved there.         
	Bolt also said he felt he could outrun Cristiano Ronaldo over 100 metres  even while running with a ball at his feet.         
	Definitely I think I can do that, Bolt said. I dont think Cristiano can beat me. Im the fastest man in the world so I can do that. (AP)

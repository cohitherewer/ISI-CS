                                                   Laxman slams century
                      
	 Manchester: Star Indian batsman V.V.S. Laxman struck his first County Championship century to put Lancashire in the box seat against Yorkshire on day three of the Division One match here.         
	After bundling out Yorkshire for 181 in the first essay, Lancashire rode on centuries from Mal Loye (146) and Laxman (109) to reach 489 for five before declaring their innings.         
	Harmison aim         
	 London: England pacer Stephen Harmison insists he has an unfinished business against Australia and is desperate to return to the side for the last two Ashes Tests. I love playing for England and I do have unfinished business with Australia. Ill never forget winning in 2005 but I dont want my last Ashes memory to be of 2006-07, neither for that first ball, nor the whole experience of losing 5-0, he said.         
	Caddick to quit         
	 London: Former England seamer Andy Caddick, who with 234 Test wickets, ranks eighth on Englands all-time list, said on Sunday he will retire from cricket at the end of this season. Its the right time to go, Caddick, who has played county cricket for Somerset since 1991, said.         
	Rudi flayed         
	 Melbourne: Umpire Rudi Koertzen has once again come under attack for his umpiring decisions in the on-going Ashes series as spin legend Shane Warne said that the South African is having a shocker of a time in England. Its unfortunate that hes doing this because hes a lovely guy and he conducts himself well But hes having a shocker, Warne was quoted as saying by an Australian newspaper.         
	Bookies case         
	 Colombo: The International Cricket Council (ICC) will look into the Pakistan Cricket Boards claim that its players were approached by bookies during their current tour of Sri Lanka. The ICC is aware of the media reports on attempted match-fixing allegations. Appropriate action will be taken by the ICC in this regard, ICC communications officer James Fitzgerald said.         
	Imran wish         
	 Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar does not have too many supporters left in Pakistan cricket but former captain and legendary all-rounder Imran Khan believes the temperamental speedster deserves one final chance in the national team. I know he has had several disciplinary problems in recent times and he has also struggled for full fitness. But I still believe there is a place for him in the national team even now, said Imran.         
	Shoaib hearing         
	 Karachi: Shoaib Akhtars efforts to wriggle out of legal wrangles received a setback after the hearing on his petition against an 18-month ban and a Rs 7 million fine was on Monday adjourned indefinitely due to the sacking of the Lahore High Court judge.           AGENCIES

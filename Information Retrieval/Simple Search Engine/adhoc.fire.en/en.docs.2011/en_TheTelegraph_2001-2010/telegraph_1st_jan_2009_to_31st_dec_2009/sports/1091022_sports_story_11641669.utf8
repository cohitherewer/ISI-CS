The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Series is not about revenge: Ricky
                                                     Series is not about revenge: Ricky
    - The Australia captain has faith in his youngsters             OUR CORRESPONDENT            Ponting in Mumbai on Wednesday                                 
	Mumbai: Australia captain Ricky Ponting, on Wednesday, said that revenge will not be on their agenda in the upcoming ODI series against India.         
	He added that the recent Champions Trophy triumph and the ODI series win in England has given his young side the much-needed confidence to take on India.         
	Ponting, in his first interaction with the media since arriving in India on Tuesday, said that the absence of stalwarts like Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist notwithstanding, his team have the wherewithal to maintain their unbeaten record in ODI series in India since 2000-01.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On the Indo-Aussie rivalry         
	We have always enjoyed coming here and playing here. Over the years, the rivalry has grown and I am sure it has done a lot of good for the world game. India are a pretty strong team and a good ODI side. With the two teams ranked No.1 and 2 going up against each other, it should be a good contest.         
	If Australia are aiming for revenge after losing the tri-series final to India at home in 2008         
	Its not about that. Whats happened is happened, you cant change that. If we win 7-0 this series, thats not going to change our loss. I am confident about our group of players, we played in England and the Champions Trophy. Hopefully, we can build on that.         
	On the youngsters who have not played in the subcontinent before         
	As far as experience is concerned, they have got some 20-30 games, and are getting their feet in international cricket. In the last 12 games, we have played some terrific cricket, both in the series against England and the Champions Trophy, and so we have the confidence going. But you cant expect that to continue. The players have to keep working at it. But yes, we are looking to play our best cricket in the coming days.         
	If Hayden and Gilchrist will be missed while playing spinners         
	It doesnt bother us. We have played some good one-day cricket recently, and the challenge for us in this series will be in the middle-order, playing the Indian spinners. We have players like Mike Hussey, Shane Watson and Cameron White, who give us flexibility, and our overall record in the one-dayers in the subcontinent has been good.         
	The importance of the series         
	Very important. It gives us a fresh set of challenges, and we will identify the little things that we need to do to win the series.         
	On the options in batting         
	Callum Ferguson and Michael Clarkes injuries are a concern, but it is a great opportunity for the younger guys. With Shaun Marsh coming back, and Tim Paine, Cameron White and Shane Watson doing well, we have options in the top order.         
	Is this Indian bowling one of the weakest you have played?         
	We wont underestimate the Indian attack... As an international side, they will find a way to do the job. Besides, Indias batting will also be formidable with the return of Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh (who were out of the Champions Trophy). We will be aiming to get on top of the Indian bowling from the start.         
	On surpassing the records set by Sachin Tendulkar         
	It would be nice if he retires sometime. I was reading about his 20th year in international cricket the other day, and I felt it was pretty remarkable in itself. He has been setting benchmarks for others I would do the best I can, and hopefully, will keep playing well enough to win as many games for Australia as possible.         
	On his own form         
	Interestingly, my record in ODIs in India is better than the Tests. In the last few weeks, I have played some of my best cricket. There will be a lot of responsibility on my shoulders, and I will be expected to score runs. Hopefully, I will do well in the series.         
	Will Mahendra Singh Dhonis task be more challenging without the support of fielding and bowling coaches?         
	Every captain faces his own challenges. I had my own in the last two years. Its part and parcel of what we do With regard to fielding and bowling coaches, I think India have a group of players, experienced guys, who can get the coaching done among themselves.         
	On the suggestion of having a points system in one-dayers         
	In a seven-match series, it is really hard to motivate yourself if the series is won early. If the ICC is really interested in preserving the one-dayers, there has to be a points system whereby every game has a meaning. If the team batting first gets out for 180, and the second team takes no risk while chasing, then it becomes boring cricket. Maybe we can have bonus points for chasing down that target in 30 overs, and those points could add up to the annual rankings table.         
	Is a seven-match series interesting enough?         
	Seven is probably too many, I think five is ok.         
	On the security measures         
	We have been very impressed about the level of security given to us right from our arrival here...

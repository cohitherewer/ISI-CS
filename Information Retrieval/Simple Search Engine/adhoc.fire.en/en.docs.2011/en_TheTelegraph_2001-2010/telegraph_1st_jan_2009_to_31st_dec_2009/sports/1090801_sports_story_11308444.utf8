                                                     Sourav impresses on his CAB debut
  - Former captain takes active part in discussions       A STAFF REPORTER            Sourav Ganguly at the CAB on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: The preview to the 78th Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) did not promise anything sensational as it was an open secret that the ruling faction, led by president Jagmohan Dalmiya, will continue at the helm of the state association.         
	The results followed exactly the same script.         
	Speculations, though, were rife that Fridays AGM was going to be one of the drabbest in the CABs recent past  especially after the high voltage episodes in 2006-07 and 2007-08. But Sourav Ganguly, representing Mohammedan Sporting, ensured it was not so as he marked his debut in an administrative role with the state cricket association with aplomb  impressing everyone.         
	During the course of the AGM, the former India captain questioned Bengals poor representation in the national team of late (Manoj Tiwary and Wriddhiman Saha being the only ones to have donned India A caps in recent times). He also spoke up for former India player Utpal Chatterjee who was unceremoniously dumped from the Bengal coachs job after helping the side move into the elite division.         
	The stylish southpaw was also vocal about national selector Raja Venkats absence from the states selection committee. That he had done his homework properly was also evident when he raised the technical aspects of the long-drawn controversy regarding excess expenditure during the inaugural edition of the Indian Premier League.         
	Sourav enjoyed every bit of it. To put it in his own words: Its a new experience and yes, I did like it.         
	The agenda was basically the development of Bengal cricket and I put forward some suggestions, which were welcomed, he said.         
	Sourav, who came to attend the meeting in his brand new BMW, left the CAB premises at around 8.30pm. But the three-and-a-half hours that he spent at the CAB marked a new chapter in his chequered career.         
	His active participation in the AGM dismissed any speck of doubt, if there was any, regarding the seriousness of his latest endeavour. That he didnt leave his flamboyance back in the cricket field was clear when he drew praise from both  the ruling and the opposition  of the state association.         
	While Sultan Ahmed, minister of state for tourism and president of the Mohammedan Sporting  also a prominent member of the anti-Dalmiya camp  termed Souravs debut in the CAB as historic, Subrata Dutta, vice-president of the All-India Football Federation, known for his closeness with the Dalmiya group, said that he was extremely impressive.         
	Well, one saw glimpses of Souravs debut in Test cricket being reflected in his maiden foray into the CAB and hopes will be that it turns out to be as successful as his career.

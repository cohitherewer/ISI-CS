The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians suffer first loss
                                                   Indians suffer first loss
                      
	Chandigarh: India suffered their first defeat in the Punjab Gold Cup, going down 2-4 to world champions Germany here Friday night.         
	The hosts have eight points from five matches and will have to wait Saturday to see if they can seal a berth in Mondays finals against Holland.         
	Holland secured a berth in the finals, defeating New Zealand 4-1 in Fridays early match. They now have 11 points.         
	India will take on New Zealand while Germany and Holland face off in the sixth and last match in the second leg Saturday.         
	India need just a draw to reach nine points, while a win for Germany will give them three points taking them to eight points.         
	India will be hoping that Germany do not beat Holland by a big margin and that they themselves dont lose to New Zealand as the second finalist will be then decided on the basis of goal difference.         
	India drew first blood in the 12th minute when Tushar Khandekar sounded the post with his reverse hit that beat German goalkeeper Nicolas Jacobi but their joy was short-lived as the Germans found the equaliser in the 14th minute through Jan Philipp Rabente.         
	The Germans soon launched a counter-attack and the Indian defence looked in complete disarray. In the 21st minute Lim Kevin struck to make it 2-1.         
	Mortiz Furste further added to the hosts miseries in the 34 th minute when he scored to make it 3-1.         
	The Indian defence was caught napping yet again in the 38th minute when Tobias pumped in the fourth goal for the visitors.         
	India got three penalty corners in the second half but skipper and drag-flicker Sandeep Singh could convert only one of them in the 64th minute. India had defeated Germany 2-0 in their last match.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand ends at tied 3rd 
                                                   Anand ends at tied 3rd 
                      
	Mainz: World champion Viswanathan Anand continued to struggle with his form and settled for a tied third in the Grenkeleasing World Rapid Chess Championship here.         
	After being eliminated in the prelims of the annual event that he had won 11 times earlier, Anand did not quite motivate himself to play well for the third place and all the four games against German Arkadiz Naiditsch ended in draws leaving the third place to be shared by both of them.         
	Meanwhile, Armenian Levon Aronian won his maiden title on Mainz soil with a clinical performance against Ian Nepomniatchchi of Russia in the finals.         
	The former world junior champion from Armenia scored victories in the first two games itself and then sealed the event and the winners jacket in his favour with a draw in the third game of the four-games final. Anands performance in the match for the third place against Naiditsch was strangely uninspired.         
	Well, as there is not that much at stake in the match for third place, it is very difficult to motivate oneself, Anand said later.         
	 Anand had white and chose a quiet Italian game, which ended in a listless 26-move draw.         
	In the second round, Naiditsch and Anand went into a well-known line of the Ruy Lopez and did not mind a draw when all rooks were swapped on the a-file.         
	Anand and Naiditsch shunned all excitement and after 23 moves the third game was over.         
	In the fourth game, Anand and Naiditsch didnt harm each other and played out a draw to share the third place.           (PTI)

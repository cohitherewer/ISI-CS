	Pretoria: Clever bowling by Australia limited South Africa to 156 for five in the second Twenty20 International at Centurion in Pretoria on Sunday.         
	Best of the Australian bowlers was Shane Harwood, who claimed the wickets of J.P. Duminy and Roelof van der Merwe at a cost of only 21 runs. Left-arm seamer Nathan Bracken, who replaced Mitchell Johnson for this match, was a lot more expensive at 44 runs.         
	South Africas batting performance was a mixed bag, with opener Herschelle Gibbs hitting 20 off 13 balls before being bowled by Bracken with a slower ball. Gibbs opening partner Robin Petersons 34 off 27 balls showed he could be a valuable batsman to move around the order.         
	Peterson hit three fours and two sixes after a scratchy start, before being bowled by James Hopes.         
	The biggest partnership of the innings was the 47 off 40 balls for the third wicket between Peterson and Duminy.           (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal is too strong for Hewitt on clay 
                                                     Nadal is too strong for Hewitt on clay 
                  Rafael Nadal in Paris on Friday                             
	Paris: Defending champion Rafael Nadal had little trouble advancing to the fourth round of the French Open.         
	World No. 1 Nadal stitched up a straightforward 6-1, 6-3, 6-1 victory over Lleyton Hewitt on Friday to keep on track his bid for a record fifth consecutive Open crown.         
	What had on paper looked like a interesting third-round match, with Hewitt one of the few players without a losing record against the Spaniard, quickly became a drab affair as the Australian former world No. 1 put up little resistance.         
	Nadal pocketed the first set in half an hour when the Australian netted a backhand before taking an early break in the second. Hewitt briefly fought back with his own break in the fourth game of the second before letting Nadal regain control.         
	Nadals pink shirt and yellow sweatbands were the matchs main bright spots as former Wimbledon and US Open champion Hewitt seemed resigned to his fate from the outset, going out to an ace after one hour and 51 minutes.         
	Always a win against Lleyton is a very good news, said Nadal. You must be playing well.         
	Novak Djokovic reached the third round, quickly completing his suspended match by easily winning the final set and beating Sergiy Stakhovsky of Ukraine 6-3, 6-4, 6-1.         
	The fourth-seeded Djokovic won the first two sets Thursday, but the match was stopped because of darkness. He broke Stakhovsky to open the third set and had little trouble the rest of the way.         
	Djokovic won his only Grand Slam title at the 2008 Australian Open, but the Serb has reached at least the semi-finals at all four major tournaments.         
	Seventh-seeded Gilles Simon of France was eliminated by No. 30 Victor Hanescu of Romania 6-4, 6-4, 6-2. Hanescu won three matches in a row for the first time this year.         
	No. 29 Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany also advanced to the third round, beating 2003 French Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, 6-7 (3), 6-3 in another match suspended by darkness Thursday night. No. 8 Fernando Verdasco of Spain, No. 10 Nikolay Davydenko of Russia, No. 12 Fernando Gonzalez of Chile and No. 13 Marin Cilic of Croatia reached the fourth round. (Agencies)

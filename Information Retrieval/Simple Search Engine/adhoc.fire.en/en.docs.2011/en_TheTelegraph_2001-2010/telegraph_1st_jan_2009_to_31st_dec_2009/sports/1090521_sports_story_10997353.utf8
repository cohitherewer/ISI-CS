                                                   3 ICL players get clearance
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Three players from Bengal, who had applied for release from the Indian Cricket League (ICL) to return to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) fold, received their no-objection certificates (NOCs) on Wednesday.         
	The ICL executive board said in a statement that players seeking a termination of their contracts have been given the go-ahead for return to the BCCI fold. The soft copies of the NOCs reached Subhamoy Das, Abhishek Jhunjhunwala and Shib Sagar Singh via emails. The hard copies have been sent via courier.         
	The players now need to send an application directly to the BCCI with a copy of the NOC, an undertaking and a covering letter. According to sources, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) are helping the players draft the letter.         
	We have received a warm welcome from the CAB. They helped us draft the letter, Subhamoy said.         
	Asked if they were hoping to make a return in the current domestic season, Subhamoy quipped: Hopefully yes. If the BCCI gives the permission by the first week of June, we can play in the P. Sen Trophy at least. We will send the required documents within the next couple of days.         
	Deep Dasgupta was yet to receive the NOC but was hopeful it will reach him soon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Abhimanyu grabs hattrick on debut
                                                                                                                                   Abhimanyu grabs hattrick on debut
                      
	Meerut: Abhimanyu Mithun registered a hattrick on debut as his match haul of 11 wickets scripted Karnatakas comprehensive 185-run victory over hosts Uttar Pradesh here Friday.         
	Chasing 438 for an improbable win, UP could manage 252 before being shot out in 66.2 overs with Abhimanyu scalping five for 95 in his first class debut, including the hattrick.         
	Mithun had Piyush Chawla caught by Balchandra Akhil off the third ball of the 60th over. He castled Amir Khan and RP Singh off the next two balls to complete his hattrick. For UP, Bhuvneshwar Kumar (63) and captain Mohammed Kaif came up with gritty centuries, before Mithun ran through the middle and lower order to script an easy win.         
	Punjab salvaged a draw against Mumbai in Chandigarh. At close, Punjab were 311 for seven in their second innings, after Pankaj Dharmani (46) and Gaurav Gambhir (50 not out) chipped in with useful contributions. While Mumbai earned three points from the drawn match, Punjab got one.         
	Pragyan Ojhas five-wicket haul dashed Himachal Pradeshs hopes of win, ensuring an exciting finish in Hyderabad. The visitors still collected three valuable points from the drawn Group A match.         
	Having conceded a 22-run first-innings lead Hyderabad resumed their second innings at 101 for three, but HP pacer Ashok Thakur (5/22) wrecked their middle and lower order to bowl them out for just 189 in 77 overs. HP needed 168 runs to win. They got off to a strong start as Bhavin Thakkar (55) and Sangram Singh (27) raced to 79. Pragyan Ojha (5/52) struck then, picking up wickets at regular intervals.         
	Meanwhile, Mehul Patel rocked the Orissa top order before Salil Yadav polished off the tail as Orissa lost to Gujarat by 159 runs.

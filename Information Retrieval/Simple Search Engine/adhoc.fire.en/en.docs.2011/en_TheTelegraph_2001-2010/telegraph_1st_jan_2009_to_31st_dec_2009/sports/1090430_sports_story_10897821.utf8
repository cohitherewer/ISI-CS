The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Victor of the match
                                                     Victor of the match
                    Mark Boucher                 
	Mark Boucher showed there can be no substitute for experience as he took the Royal Challengers Bangalore to a five-wicket win against the Kolkata Knight Riders on Wednesday. Showing a cool head, the wicketkeeper-batsman hit 25 of 13 balls. With 10 runs required from the last over off Chris Gayle, Boucher held his nerves to hit a boundary to wrap up the match with a ball to spare. Accustomed to finishing games for South Africa, Boucher showed the right mix of sensible running and clean hitting. In a match where any team could have won, Boucher made the difference.

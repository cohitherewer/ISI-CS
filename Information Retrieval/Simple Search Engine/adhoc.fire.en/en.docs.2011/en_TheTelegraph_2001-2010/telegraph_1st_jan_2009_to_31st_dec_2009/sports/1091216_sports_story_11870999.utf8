            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Rajkot: Veteran Muttiah Muralidharan is understood to be travelling separately on Wednesday morning, instead of moving out with the Sri Lanka team in the afternoon, fuelling speculation that he could be heading home.         
	Murali didnt play in the opening ODI, on Tuesday, and has been carrying an injury to his right hand from the final Test of the recent three-match series.         
	Calls made by The Telegraph to manager Brendon Kuruppu went unanswered, but a local official maintained that the legendary offie wouldnt be travelling to Nagpur, venue of the second ODI.

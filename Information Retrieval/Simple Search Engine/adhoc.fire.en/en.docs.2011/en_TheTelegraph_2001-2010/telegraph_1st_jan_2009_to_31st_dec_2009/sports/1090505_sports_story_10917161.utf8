                                                   Brasa ready for the challenge
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Spaniard Jose Brasa, who was appointed chief coach of the Indian hockey team on Monday, said he came to India despite receiving a negative feedback from Australian hockey legend Ric Charlesworth and that now he was ready for the challenge of coaching the Indian team.         
	Brasa, who has signed the contract and would be leaving for Malaysia on Wednesday night to join the Indian team in the Asia Cup, said Charlesworth had advised him not to take up the current assignment.Charlesworth, was the technical advisor of Indian hockey for a brief period last year and left after problems with the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) and the ministry of sports.         
	We exchanged a lot of e-mails, said Brasa. He clearly told me not to go but I decided to take up the challenge.         
	Asked to comment on the current India side, Brasa said the players needed to improve on teamwork. At the same time, I must admit that they have a lot of skill. I am sure we will be able to win a lot of medals. Sources said that while Brasa will be chief coach, the current coach-in-charge Harendra Singh will be made the national coach. Four other coaches  Clarence Lobo, Ramandeep Singh, A.K. Bansal and Romeo James  will assist the Spaniard.         
	Brasa was happy that the sports ministry had accepted his request to provide him with a Hindi teacher for the next six months.

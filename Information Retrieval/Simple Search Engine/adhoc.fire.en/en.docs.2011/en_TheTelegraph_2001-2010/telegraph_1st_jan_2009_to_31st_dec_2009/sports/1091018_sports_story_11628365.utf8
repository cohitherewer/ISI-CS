The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | DareDevils and RCB bow out

	Bangalore: The Bangalore Royal Challengers and Delhi DareDevils crashed out of the Champions League Twenty20 after the formers eight-wicket victory over their Indian Premier League opponents here Saturday.         
	In a dramatic League B Super Eight match at the packed Chainnaswamy Stadium, Ross Taylor smashed a blistering 65 off just 38 balls to help the Royal Challengers surpass the target of 139 with nearly five overs to spare.         
	Earlier, the Royal Challengers captain Anil Kumble led from the front by grabbing three wickets to restrict the DareDevils to a modest 138 for six.         
	Bangalore were only playing for pride as they were already out of contention for a semi-final berth after Cape Cobras victory over Victoria Bushrangers in another League B match earlier in the day.         
	The eventful day saw the first match being delayed by one hour and 40 minutes and reduced it to 17-overs-a-side affair due to bomb scare.         
	The result of the second match between the two IPL sides meant that no Indian side will play in the semi-finals of the $6million tournament.         
	South African side Cape Cobras and Australias Victoria Bushrangers made it to the semi-finals from League B as both have collected four points each.         
	The DareDevils last match at home against the Cape Cobras on Monday thus will be rendered inconsequential.         
	The Royal Challengers made a subdued start not wanting to take risk against Ashish Nehra and Dirk Nannes, who bowled consistently above 150 kph.         
	They also suffered a jolt in the second over as Manish Pandey retired hurt after a desperate lunge forward to reach the crease.         
	But, Ross Taylor (65) was in a punishing mood. He hit six fours and four sixes in his 38-ball stay at the crease.         
	Bangalore were 68 for one after the 10th over but the run riot by Taylor and latter by Dravid, who made unbeaten 32 off 26 balls ensured that the Bangalore side reach 139 in 15.1 overs. Virat Hohli, whose unbeaten 24 from 10 balls included five fours, played a nice cameo. Dravid ended the match in style hitting Nehra for a six.

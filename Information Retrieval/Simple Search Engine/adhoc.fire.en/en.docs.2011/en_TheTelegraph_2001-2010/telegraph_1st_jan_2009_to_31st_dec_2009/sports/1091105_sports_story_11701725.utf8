The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vital cogs happy   to come good 
                                                                                                                                   Vital cogs happy   to come good 
            A STAFF REPORTER                                  
	Calcutta: They are, perhaps, the two most essential components of Bengals batting line-up that the Laxmi Ratan Shukla-led side need if they harbour any hopes of excelling in the Ranji Trophy this season.         
	And, on Wednesday, Avisekh Jhunjhunwala (95) and Manoj Tiwary (88) highlighted their role as they ensured Bengals crucial 145-run first innings lead against Maharashtra in a Super League match in Pune.         
	While Avisekh, who is making a comeback to the mainstream after severing ties with the Indian Cricket League, expressed satisfaction at getting a good start to the season, Manoj, selected in the Board Presidents XI for the match against Sri Lanka, considers the performance as another step towards his ultimate goal.         
	I have my personal goals and its a great way to start the season as Im returning to the mainstream. Hopefully I will maintain it, Avisekh said. I know what I want to achieve this year I have certain plans. Its always good to carry runs behind your back. All I want is to keep a level head, said Manoj.         
	With the pitch already developing a few cracks and the fast bowlers exploiting the low bounce in the track, both felt that the fortune of the match hinged much on Thursdays performance.         
	But, while Avisekh was more diplomatic in his answer saying the match is still open, Manoj made it clear that they were looking forward to getting five points from the match.

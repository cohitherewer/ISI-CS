The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chris Gayle draws flak
                                                   Chris Gayle draws flak
                      
	Melbourne: Chris Gayle has become an embarrassment for the West Indies cricket after saying that he wouldnt cry if Test cricket died, feels former Australian captain Kim Hughes.         
	Gayle sparked an outrage when he said that he wanted to give up national captaincy and focus on playing Twenty20 cricket. Hughes lambasted Gayle for his comments and said that he was an embarrassment to the game in the Caribbean. The Aussies criticism of Gayle was backed by the legendary Sir Vivian Richards, who felt the batsmans comments were a total betrayal of the game that raised him. Former Australian captains Ian Chappell and Mark Taylor went a step further and called for Gayles sacking.

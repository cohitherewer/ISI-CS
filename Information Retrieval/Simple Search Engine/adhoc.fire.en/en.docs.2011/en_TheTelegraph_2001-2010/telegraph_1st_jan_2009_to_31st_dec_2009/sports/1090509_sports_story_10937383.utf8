The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Reds hope United will stumble
                                                     Reds hope United will stumble
                  Steven Gerrard is upbeat about his teams chances                     
	London: Liverpool hope that Manchester United will be so distracted by the mouth-watering Champions League final against Barcelona that they will take their eye off the Premier League title race. Liverpool players say they are ready to take advantage if United slip up on Sunday against local rivals Manchester City, who have won their last four games.         
	By then, Liverpool, who has scored 26 goals in winning seven of their last eight Premier League games, could be on top of the standings on goal difference for one day at least by winning at West Ham on Saturday.         
	We will keep going until the end. We wont surrender when were so close, Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard said. Winning the title with this club would mean the world to me.         
	If the results go the wrong way for Liverpool, however, the league title could be out of reach on Wednesday when United, who have a game in hand, face Wigan.         
	Gerrard says his teams form keeps it in contention for a first league title since 1990. But its likely he will have to wait another season.         
	We have got world class players, we have turned in some fantastic displays of attacking football and some really solid defensive performances. We have got absolutely everything you need to be successful at the very highest level.                     
	Meanwhile Xabi Alonso will miss Saturdays match after failing to recover from a foot injury inflicted by Joey Bartons illegal challenge that resulted in the Newcastle midfielders dismissal.         
	The Spain midfielder is still badly bruised from Bartons sliding tackle in Sundays 3-0 victory over Newcastle.         
	Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez said Friday: We had an idea that he could be fit for this game but in the end it was impossible.         
	Striker Fernando Torres will, however, return from a hamstring strain .         
	Down at the foot of the standings, last place West Bromwich Albion appear certain to be relegated and need a home victory over Wigan to stand any chance of survival. The Baggies are three points behind Newcastle and Middlesbrough who have 31 points but dont play each other until Monday.         
	One place above the northeastern neighbours are Hull who have a three-point advantage over them with three rounds to go. The Tigers host Stoke, who are virtually safe.         
	Sunderland, who have 35 points, visit Bolton while Blackburn, 37 points and almost safe in 15th place, host Portsmouth who are one place above with 38.         
	Fifth-place Aston Villa go to Fulham and Everton, one place behind, welcome Tottenham with all four clubs chasing spots in next seasons Europa League, the rebranded Uefa Cup. (AP)

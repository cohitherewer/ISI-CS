The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nehra makes comeback 
                                                     Nehra makes comeback 
    - Vijays technique gets him ODI berth, Nayar included           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ashish Nehra                                 
	London: The bounce-India-out strategy, successfully employed by the West Indies and England in the World T20, encouraged the national selectors to pick Subramaniam Badrinath and Murali Vijay, batsmen strong on technique.         
	The Tamil Nadu duo, therefore, will be heading to the West Indies for a four-match ODI series between June 26 and July 5.         
	While Badrinath, who bats in the middle order, has played three ODIs, opener Vijay (who made his Test debut against Australia last November) makes an ODI squad for the first time.         
	Mumbais Abhishek Nayar too has got a maiden call-up, taking the all-rounders berth thus far occupied by Irfan Pathan.                   Murali Vijay (top) and Abhishek Nayar            
	Badrinath has come in for Suresh Raina, who has suffered a hairline fracture on a thumb and is out for two weeks. Vijays there because of Virender Sehwags non-availability.         
	Sachin Tendulkar and Zaheer Khan have been rested  the former of his own accord, the latter by the selectors.         
	The most remarkable selection has, of course, been Delhi quick Ashish Nehras. That he stood a good chance had been reported in Wednesdays edition of The Telegraph.         
	Nehras last India appearance, in any form, was during a tri-series in Zimbabwe four years ago.         
	Clearly, the recent IPL proved to be Nehras comeback vehicle. Turning out for the Delhi DareDevils, he took 19 wickets to finish as the third most successful bowler.         
	With Zaheer not there and Ishant (Sharma) not bowling well, the selectors decided to go for experience and, so, Dhawal Kulkarni couldnt make it, a well-placed source said.         
	Experience, by the way, was also a factor in Vijays selection. If he hadnt already played for India, then Ajinkya Rahane could have pipped him.         
	Dinesh Karthik (Sehwags replacement in the World T20) made it as the 16th member, but Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Co. should have used the tour to give one of the younger keepers exposure.         
	Karthik too is from Tamil Nadu, the home state of Srikkanth and BCCI secretary N.Srinivasan, who convenes selection committee meetings.         
	Twelve of the 16 are already in London and will leave for the West Indies on Thursday itself, well before the original departure date (June 22).         
	Strangely, Team Indias disastrous showing in the World T20 didnt figure in the teleconference featuring the selectors, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and (outspoken) coach Gary Kirsten.   
	THE WEST INDIES-BOUND SQUAD  Openers: Gautam Gambhir, Murali Vijay.
  Middle order batsmen: Yuvraj Singh (vice-capt,), Rohit Sharma, Subramaniam Badrinath.

                                                   WI breached pact: Fica 
                      
	Melbourne: The Federation of International Cricketers Association (Fica) chief executive Tim May Friday said that the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) has breached an ICC agreement by picking up a third rate side for the Champions Trophy.         
	May argued that all the competing sides are required to field their best sides as per the ICC rules.         
	Although the revolting players made themselves available for the Champions Trophy in return for mediation, the Board stuck with the players who lost the Bangladesh series.         
	...I would suggest that the West Indies insistence on picking a third rate side devalues that tournament (the Champions Trophy) and that pain is going to be shared by the rest of the cricketing nations, said May.           (PTI)

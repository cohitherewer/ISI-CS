The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhaichung asks for interim relief
                                                     Bhaichung asks for interim relief
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bhaichung Bhutia                           
	New Delhi: Bhaichung Bhutias fight to resume club football was left hanging in balance when Amarendra Sharan, the arbitrator approached by the All India Football Federation (AIFF), asked the footballer and the Mohun Bagan Club to appear for another round of hearing on Sunday.         
	Sharan, a former Additional Solicitor General of India, met the two parties in the capital on Tuesday and asked them to submit documents to support their claims. While Bhutia was personally present with his lawyer, Ushanath Banerjee, Mohun Bagan was represented by the representatives of a law firm.         
	According to sources, Bhutia appealed to the arbitrator for an interim relief, so that he could play for East Bengal in the Durand Cup, beginning at the Ambedkar Stadium here on Friday. Mohun Bagan, on the other hand, is believed to have sought financial compensation to settle the matter.         
	The two parties exchanged documents pertaining to their case, discussed the procedure they would be following and also agreed to find a quick solution in the interest of the game.         
	Bhutia, who recently led India to a historic triumph in the Nehru Cup is fighting against Mohun Bagans decision to slap a six-month suspension on him for missing club practice sessions and an exhibition match last season.         
	The issue was further complicated when a dejected Bhutia decided to switch over to East Bengal for the 2009-10 season and asked for a release from Mohun Bagan.         
	The Indian captain requested the Indian Football Association (IFA) and the AIFF to solve the impasse but neither of the two bodies could break the deadlock, forcing the national federation to seek the help of an arbitrator.

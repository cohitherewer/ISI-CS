The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Buchanan has change of heart, flays critics
                                                   Buchanan has change of heart, flays critics
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former Australia coach John Buchanan on Sunday reacted to Sunil Gavaskars criticism, saying his similarities with ex-captain Steve Waugh took the team to dizzying heights.         
	Suggesting Buchanans multiple-skipper theory did not deserve comment, the former India captain had written in his syndicated column he has wangled for his Queensland pals and former teammates lucrative jobs with the franchise The owners, poor souls, probably have little idea of how they are being milked.         
	Contacted by The Telegraph, the Kolkata Knight Riders cricket manager had refused to comment when the controversy broke. The hotels net is down and the wi-fi hasnt been working So, while Ive been told about Gavaskars column, I havent actually read it Even if I had, I wouldnt have reacted So, no comments, Buchanan had said from Bloemfontein.         
	But, Buchanan obviously has had a change of heart in the past few days.         
	There were always people who were more than willing to put the knife in, and the fact that I never played Test cricket was simmering in the background of these digs, particularly by a select few, Buchanan was quoted as saying by a South African newspaper on Sunday.         
	I never shook the feeling that the axe was always hovering, he added.         
	Steve Waugh and I were similar in some regards and this helped Australian cricket to reach the heights it has. We both challenged the existing parameters and norms, and created a vision of life education outside the dressing room, Buchanan said recalling Australias dream run during his tenure as coach.         
	Buchanan also admitted he had a strained relationship with Shane Warne, who always disapproved of the coachs ideas when they played together, but added the bowlers outspokenness was always wondered about.         
	There was indeed a lot of attention given to the relationship I had with Warne. You must remember we are from opposite ends of the spectrum regarding personalities.         
	He might have spoken his mind to the press but at least he spoke his mind and you would never die wondering with him. Even though I have massive respect for the person, the player and the entertainer, we have a distant relationship. There is no conversation between us to speak of, he said.         
	Buchanan also felt the furore over his four-captain theory was because most people misinterpreted it.         
	Buchanan felt since Twenty20 was a fast paced game it was important to have a unique strategy everytime, so he wanted a number of minds to increase the rate of success.         
	However, with a unique, fast-flowing and hectic game like Twenty20 I feel there should be more decision-makers, more captains in the process to succeed, so one has to think differently, he said.         
	Buchanan compared the fast-paced Twenty20 version to a battle. My favourite book of all time is The Art of War by the Chinese military genius Sun Tzu, written some 5000 years ago. I think this book was written to describe Twenty20 cricket.         
	Buchanan, who could take over as Englands consultant, believes the next Ashes will be closer than some may think. The next Ashes could be a tight affair. Both England and Australia have battled over the past 18 months to hit their straps, he said.

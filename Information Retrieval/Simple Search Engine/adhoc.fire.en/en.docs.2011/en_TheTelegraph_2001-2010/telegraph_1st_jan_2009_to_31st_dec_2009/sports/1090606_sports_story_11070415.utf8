                                                                                                               Aidan eyes third win 
                          
	Epsom (UK): The Two hundred thirtieth running of the Derby at the Epsom Downs, on Saturday, has attacted 13 hopefuls for a winners purse of 1.25 million. The Derby nearly went ahead without a sponsor until Investec got on board only a month ago after Vodafone ended its involvement last year.          
	Trainer Aidan Brien has six horses running in the field and bidding for a third winner following Galileos victory in 2001 and High Chaparral the year after. As of Friday morning, John Oxx-trained Sea The Stars, the 2000 Guineas winner, was the 11-4 favourite with Totesport, the official betting partner for the Derby Festival. Briens Fame And Glory and Rip Van Winkle, each at 4-1, are next in the betting.          
	The going at Epsom Downs on Friday, featuring the Investec Oaks, was good. The Oaks was won by the favourite Sariska, just beating Midday in desperately close finish.

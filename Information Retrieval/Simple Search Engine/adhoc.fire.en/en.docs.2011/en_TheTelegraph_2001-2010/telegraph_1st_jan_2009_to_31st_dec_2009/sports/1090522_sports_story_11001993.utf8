The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kallis praises leader Kumble
                                                   Kallis praises leader Kumble
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Jacques Kallis, who was initially the favourite to lead the Royal Challengers Bangalore after Kevin Pietersens departure, said appointing Anil Kumble as the teams captain was a very good decision.         
	Kallis was to succeed Pietersen after his departure to England for national duty but Kumble was finally chosen for the job. Kallis said he has no issues with the decision since captaincy would have been a burden on him as he is already saddled by bowling and batting responsibilities.         
	I think it was going to be tough for me to take the captaincy being an all-rounder  especially after opening the batting, opening the bowling, and worrying about the fielding, he said.         
	The Royal Challengers Bangalore flourished under Kumble and Kallis said it was a good idea to hand him the captaincy.         
	For Kumble it was a lot easier to lead the team as a bowler. He had an added advantage of being an Indian. He knows most of the players well and that makes his job easier. I think right choice was made. I was totally happy with that, Kallis told IPLs official website.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal bows out of Qatar

	Doha: Rafael Nadals Australian Open preparation hit a stumbling block on Thursday when he was beaten 6-4, 6-4 by Frenchman Gael Monfils in the quarter finals of the Qatar Open.         
	The world No. 1 had been hoping to get some much needed match practice before the seasons opening Grand Slam, which starts on January 19, after being injured during the final stages of the 2008 season.         
	But his stay in Doha lasted only three matches after he was outclassed by Monfils, who will face Andy Roddick in the semi-finals.         
	Roddick beat Romanias Victor Hanescu 6-3, 6-2 earlier on Thursday.         
	Fifth seed Monfils secured his first win over Nadal in four attempts. The pair swapped breaks in the opening set before Nadal was broken again in the 10th game to hand Monfils the opening set. The crucial moment of the second set again came in the 10th game when Monfils broke the Spaniard to clinch the match.

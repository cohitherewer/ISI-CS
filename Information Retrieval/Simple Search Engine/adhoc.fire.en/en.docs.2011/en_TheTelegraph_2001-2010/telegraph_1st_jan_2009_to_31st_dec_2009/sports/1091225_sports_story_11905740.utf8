The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australians need big series win
                                                                                                                       7                                      Australians need big series win
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Australia need to beat Pakistan comprehensively in the three-Test series starting in Melbourne on Saturday, if they are to retain their third position in the Reliance Mobile ICC Test Championship table.         
	Australia start the series with a difference of 33 rating points to sixth-placed Pakistan, and this gap means they are expected to win the series convincingly.         
	As the rankings are made to reflect this difference, failure to win comfortably will mean Australia will drop points, according to an International Cricket Council release Thursday.         
	While Australias 2-0 win will keep them on 116 ratings points and a clean sweep will earn them just two ratings points, a 1-0 or 2-1 series win will drop them to 115 ratings points, behind Sri Lanka, when the ratings are calculated beyond the decimal point.         
	On the other side of the coin, Pakistans series win will severely dent Australias hopes of narrowing the gap with the front-runners.         
	A 1-0 or 2-1 series win for Pakistan will drop Australia to 110 ratings points, and if the home team suffer three consecutive defeats, they will slip to 107 ratings points, just two ahead of fifth-placed England, who are playing a four-Test series against South Africa.         
	In the rankings for batsmen, Pakistan captain Mohammed Yousuf is the highest-ranked batsman from either side. He is in the fifth position, just 11 points behind India opener Virender Sehwag, and as many points ahead of Australia vice-captain Michael Clarke. Australia captain Ricky Ponting is in the 14th position, his lowest ranking since October 2002.         
	Batsmen outside the top-20 are Simon Katich (21st), Brad Haddin (28th), Kamran Akmal (32nd), Phillip Hughes (34th), Umar Akmal (36th), Imran Farhat (38th) and Marcus North (42nd).         
	Gautam Gambhir still heads the batting table.

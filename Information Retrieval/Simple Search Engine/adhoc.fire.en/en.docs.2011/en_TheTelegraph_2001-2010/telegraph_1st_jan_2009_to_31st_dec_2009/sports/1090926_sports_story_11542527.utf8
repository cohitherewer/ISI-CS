The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its do or die for Windies against the Aussies
                                                     Its do or die for Windies against the Aussies
          
	Johannesburg: West Indies, after their first match defeat to Pakistan, face an uphill task of shocking the defending champions Australians if they have to keep their hopes alive in the Champions Trophy Saturday.         
	Without senior players, the West Indies, have so far been a second string team and they dont stand any chance against Australia.         
	Batting has been the major cause of worry for the West Indies, who were bundled out for a paltry 133 against Pakistan and if they have to pose any challenge to the Australians, they will have to regroup their resources well on Saturday.         
	However, the Caribbeans will take pride from the fact that they shot out half of the Pakistan side while defending the meagre total. The onus will be on pacer Gavin Tonge, who bagged four wickets in that match on Wednesday.         
	Australia, on the other hand, are on a high after their 6-1 win in the just-concluded ODI series against England and they dont have much to bother about.         
	Apart from the last match, Australia dominated the whole series with in-form batsmen like Michael Clarke, Mike Hussey and skipper Ricky Ponting and they are eyeing to carry on the momentum.         
	Among the bowlers, pace spearhead Brett Lee is back in the squad and has been in ominous rhythm.         
	Lee has been the highest wicket-taker in the ODI series against England claiming 12 wickets from six matches, followed by Shane Watson and Mitchell Johnson, both bagging 10 wickets each from seven and six matches respectively.         
	All-rounder Cameron White has been the highest scorer for Australia, amassing 260 runs from seven matches during the ODI series against England.

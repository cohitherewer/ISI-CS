The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mohun Bagan hits out at IFA
                                                   Mohun Bagan hits out at IFA
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra lashed out at the Indian Football Association (IFA) on Friday terming the ruling bodys decision to slap a fine of Rs 2 lakh on Snehasish Chakraborty as one-sided and a fixed affair.         
	Snehasish had alleged East Bengal of forging his signature.         
	An enraged Mitra said: We are extremely unhappy with the IFAs decision. We would appeal for a review of the judgement.         
	Mitra went on to add: Snehasish will begin practice with Mohun Bagan from Saturday.         
	Commenting on the IFAs demand that Snehasish will have to tender an apology to East Bengal, Mitra said: Theres no question of him apologising because we dont think he has done anything illegal.         
	According to Mitra, the IFA should have summoned Snehasish while his signatures were being tallied by the handwriting expert.         
	On the other hand, IFA secretary Utpal Ganguli was of the view that Bagans claims were unjust as everything was specified in IFAs players status committee meeting on last Saturday.         
	It was agreed by both parties as to what the course of action would be, he said.         
	He was also furious at Mitras comment that the whole issue was fixed.         
	This is nothing new Whenever a decision from the IFA goes against the bigwigs of Calcutta they throw allegations at the ruling body! he summed up.         
	He also made it clear that without the fine and the apology, Snehasish wouldnt be able to register for any club.         
	Meanwhile, former India captain Samar Bannerjee will be awarded the Mohun Bagan Ratna for 2008-09 season.

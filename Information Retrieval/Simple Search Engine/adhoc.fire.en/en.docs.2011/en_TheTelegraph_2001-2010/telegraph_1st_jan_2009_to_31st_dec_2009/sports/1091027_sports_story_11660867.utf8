	Madrid: Seydou Keita hit a hattrick and Zlatan Ibrahimovic netted twice to lead Barcelona to a 6-1 thrashing of Real Zaragoza and send the La Liga champions three points clear of Real Madrid on Sunday.         
	Real and Barca had both lost in Europe in midweek but after a depleted Madrid side drew 0-0 at Sporting Gijon on Saturday, Pep Guardiolas team grabbed their chance to pull emphatically away at the top of the standings.Barca have 22 poi-nts from eight matches to Re-als 19, and Sevilla remain in third, three points further back, after being held to a 0-0 draw at home to Espanyol on Saturday.         
	Zaragoza kept a dominant Barca at bay for the first 24 minutes at the Nou Camp until Keita leapt to nod Lionel Messis precise cross into the top left-hand corner.         
	Ibrahimovic doubled their lead five minutes later with a thunderous, long-range free-kick that Juan Pablo Carrizo could only palm into the roof of the net and the Sweden striker then turned provider just before the break.         
	Xavi sent him clear on the left and he squared for Keita to thump the ball into the empty net. He returned the favour 11 minutes after the break when he crossed for Ibrahimovic to volley past Carrizo for his seventh La Liga goal, taking him joint top of the scoring charts, before Jorge Lopez beat Victor Valdes with a low drive.         
	Messi made up for several missed chances when he lifted the ball over Carrizo for Barcas fifth, and his sixth of the season, and Keita completed the rout with another header in the 86th.

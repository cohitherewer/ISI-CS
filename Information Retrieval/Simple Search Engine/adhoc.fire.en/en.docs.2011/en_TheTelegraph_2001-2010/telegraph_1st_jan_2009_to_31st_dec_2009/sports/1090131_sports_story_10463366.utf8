                                                   Have to convert chances: Shabbir
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali said his team needed to convert their chances if they were to brighten their prospects in the I-League.         
	Speaking to reporters after the teams practice on Friday, Shabbir said it was important for the other players to support Mike Okoro in scoring the goals.         
	We need an allround improvement in our performance. But foremost we have to convert from our chances. Were creating a lot of chances but the goals arent coming, Shabbir said.         
	Our new foreigner Eugene Gray scored a good goal the other day against Air India. Hopefully his understanding with Okoro will grow in the coming matches.         
	The coach also lamented the loss of prolific scorer Theodore Sunday through an injury. The club had to release Sunday before the second phase of the I-League due to injury.         
	Sunday was a good scorer No doubt about that. It would have been good to have him. But I have to fight with whatever resources I have.         
	Mohammedan Sporting also announced an incentive of Rs 50,000 for their players if they beat Sporting Clube de Goa on Saturday.

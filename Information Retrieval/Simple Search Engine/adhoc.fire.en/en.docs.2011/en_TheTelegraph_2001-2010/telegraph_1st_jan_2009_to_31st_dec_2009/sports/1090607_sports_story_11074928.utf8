	London: West Indies openers Chris Gayle and Andre Fletcher put on 133 in 69 balls on Saturday to steer their team to a seven-wicket win over Australia in the World Twenty20.         
	Gayle smashed six sixes and six boundaries for 88 off 50 balls and Fletcher hit 53 off 32 deliveries, including seven boundaries, as the West Indies reached 172 for three to eclipse Australias total of 169 for seven with 25 balls to spare at The Oval.         
	The pairs stand was the third highest international Twenty20 partnership. Brett Lee received most of the punishment, with figures of none for 51 in three overs at one stage.         
	Gayle collected 27 runs off Lees third over after hitting three massive sixes, one of which went out of the ground and into an adjoining school and another that landed on the roof of a stand bordering long on.         
	Australia need to beat Sri Lanka on Monday at Trent Bridge to have any chance of advancing to the Super Eight stage from Group C. The West Indies next play Sri Lanka on Wednesday at Trent Bridge.         
	David Warner, who has played only one first-class match, had earlier led Australia to a defendable total after the team lost Shane Watson and Ricky Ponting off consecutive balls in the first over to be three for two. Warner scored 63 off 53 deliveries, including six boundaries and a six.         
	While the other batsmen had to contend with fiery treatment from the bowlers, Warner experienced the fielders generosity. In Jerome Taylors second over, two fumbles in the in-field resulted in two boundaries and Warner was off.         
	Taylor had Watson caught by Ramnaresh Sarwan and then trapped Ponting lbw after Australia had won the toss and elected to bat. Three overs and 12 runs later, Michael Clarke was caught for two by Suliemann Benn off Fidel Edwards to leave Australia reeling.         
	However, Warner and Brad Haddin added 66 in eight overs before the latter was caught by Benn off Kieron Pollard for 24. Warner was out in the 16th over with the total on 113, becoming Benns third catch of the innings to give Dwayne Bravo a wicket.         
	The Hussey brothers put on 30 in 14 balls before David was caught by Fletcher off Bravo. Mitchell Johnson was the last man out, caught by Bravo off Edwards for nine, leaving Michael Hussey not out on 28 from 15 balls. Bravo had figures of two for 31, while Taylor took two for 33 and Edwards two for 34.         
	The Caribbean reply was immediate and murderous in its intent. After Lee had been clobbered for 27 off the fifth over of the innings, the West Indies was 71 without loss and the pair soon brought up the 100 in 51 balls.         
	Fletcher was out skying a ball from Johnson to be caught by David Hussey in the 12th over. Gayle followed 18 balls later, caught by Watson off Lee to leave the West Indies on 157 for two. In the next over, Xavier Marshall was caught by Hopes to give Johnson his second wicket. But Sarwan and Shivnarine Chanderpaul saw the West Indies home.         
	The pace off the surface worked for both the West Indies bowlers and batsmen. While Taylor and Edwards used the briskness and clever variations to take early wickets, the ball travelled as fast off the bats of Gayle and Fletcher as it came on to them.

	Bangalore: Suresh Marathe scored an unbeaten 80 and carried Air India Red through to the final of the Sahara BCCI Corporate Trophy. Marathes knock gave his team a five-wicket victory over ONGC in the first semi-final here on Saturday.         
	For Air India Red, Praveen Kumar (12) and Sandeep Sharma (8) opened the innings. But for a team that had Gautam Gambhir and Tanmay Srivastava (29) in their ranks, the choice of the openers was quite puzzling.         
	When Dhawal Kulkarni did away with both the openers in consecutive deliveries, in the seventh over, it was down to Gambhir and Virat Kohli (46) to set up a decent total.         
	They threatened to do so during a 92-run third-wicket partnership. But Air India Red came back through two part-time spinners  Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina. Gambhir top scored for his side with 63. However, ONGCs lower-middle order fumbled and four batsmen, including Ajay Ratra (5) and Mayank Tehlan (3), returned to the dug out without getting to double digits.

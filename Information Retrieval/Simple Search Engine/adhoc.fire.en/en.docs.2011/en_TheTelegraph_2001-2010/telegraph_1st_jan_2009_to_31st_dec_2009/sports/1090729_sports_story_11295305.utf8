The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | WIPA hits back at Lloyd, Holding
                                                   WIPA hits back at Lloyd, Holding
                      
	Kingston: The West Indies Players Association (WIPA), stung by the scathing criticism from Clive Lloyd and Michael Holding, has hit back at the West Indian greats saying their remarks were unfortunate and misleading.         
	Reacting to the tussle between the WIPA and the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) over player contracts, Lloyd had said that the WIPA was not trying to achieve anything but strengthen their bank balance and also termed the players greedy.         
	Holding had wondered if some WIPA officials were trying to settle personal grouses with the board.         
	Lloyds condemnation of WIPA.... is most unfortunate, wrong and misleading, WIPA said in a statement on its website.         
	It maybe that the former West Indies cricket captain is unaware of the multifarious activities in which WIPA has been engaged to prepare players for a life after cricket, WIPA said in a statement.         
	WIPA also said that the current players were better than Lloyd and his teammates at least as they didnt join any rebel league, unlike the former skipper who had joined the Kerry Packer-owned World Series Cricket (WSC).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | One of my best innings: Mithali
                                                   One of my best innings: Mithali
                      
	Taunton: Mithali Raj rated her 32 off 22 balls, which earned India the crucial five-wicket victory over Sri Lanka on Monday, among her best.         
	The 26-year old Mithali, who hit four boundaries in the match, came out when India were struggling at 39 for three wickets in 10 overs.         
	She stitched up a crucial 24-run stand with opener Poonam Raut as her side overhauled the paltry target of 95.         
	This ground has always given me runs. Because of the situation, this was still one of my best innings. Even though it was only 32, I feel happy that my team won the match, Mithali said after the match.         
	Although she is not ready to compare the match-winning contribution with her in Test performances, Mithali is now raring to start in semi-final from where she left Monday and confident about crossing the final hurdle as well.         
	I cant really compare my Test double century with a Twenty20 innings, but I might swap another good innings in the semis for my Test score - what I really want is to be a member of a Cup-winning side, she said.         
	The former India captain had emerged as one of Indias most capable batswomen with a staggering 214 against England in the second and final Test at Taunton.         
	Indian eves will face New Zealand at the Trent Bridge in the final-four stage of the tournament on Thursday.           (AGENCIES)

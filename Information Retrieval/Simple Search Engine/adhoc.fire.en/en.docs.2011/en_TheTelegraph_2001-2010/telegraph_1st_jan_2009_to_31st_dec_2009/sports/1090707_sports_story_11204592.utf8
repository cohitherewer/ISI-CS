                                                   Yuvraj is No.2 in ODIs
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Yuvraj Singh achieved a career-best second position in the Reliance Mobile ICC Player Rankings for ODI batsmen after good performance against the West Indies in the recently concluded series.         
	India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni retained the top spot to make it a one-two for India. The other Indian in the top 10 was Virender Sehwag at the seventh place. Gautam Gambhir, however, slipped four places to share the 20th spot with New Zealands Ross Taylor.         
	Despite winning the four-match series against the West Indies, there was, however, no such good news for India as Dhonis men missed a chance to reclaim the second spot in the ICC ODI Championship and remained third, behind Australia and South Africa. India, who needed to win all their matches, lost in the second tie at the Sabina Park.         
	In the bowlers chart, Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh lost three places to be at 26th while Praveen Kumar dropped six places to 33rd.         
	Sri Lankan Nuwan Kulasekara leads the bowlers rankings. Ishant Sharma, however, managed to move up two rungs to 39th.         
	Yuvraj, meanwhile, has fallen out of the top five of the ICC Player Rankings for all-rounders.

	Macau: Pete Sampras edged by Andre Agassi in three sets on Sunday as the two retired American tennis greats revisited one of the sports greatest rivalries.         
	The 3-6, 6-3, 10-8 win in this southern Chinese gambling enclave was the first time the two had played since Sampras won in the 2002 US Open final for his then-record 14th Grand Slam.         
	The fast indoor surface at The Venetian Macao arena favoured Sampras attacking style, but it was Agassi who came out packing more heat in his serve, showing no signs of the bad back that required four injections during his final tournament, the 2006 US Open. But Sampras, who beat Roger Federer at the same venue in an exhibition two years ago, recovered, serving an ace and using a delicate pickup volley to secure the second set.         
	He continued his strong form into the super tiebreaker, overwhelming Agassi with his powerful serve. Trailing 9-6, Agassi saved two match points  the second with a down-the-line backhand winner  but Sampras served out the match with another ace.         
	Thanks for the exercise, Agassi told Sampras after the match. It was a great afternoon. Playing in front of 11,000 enthusiastic fans was fantastic and there was real energy. It was a pleasure competing against Pete. Its always a joy to test your skills and see where you are at, no matter where you are in life.         
	Sampras was all praise. Back in the day, Andre was one of those players where if you werent playing your best, youre going to lose. Some of the other guys I could beat them even when I wasnt playing me best, but not Andre, he said.         
	The match was preceded by a 45-minute timed encounter between the worlds best junior Yuki Bhambri and Americas leading junior Ryan Harrison. Bhambri was a little fortunate to win that match with the set tied at 5-5.,The Indian was ahead 15-0 in the game when the match was timed out.         
	The two returned on court to partner their heroes in a doubles exhibition later, which Pete and Yuki won 7-5.         
	The two Americans captivated fans in the 1990s and early 2000s with their contrasting styles and personalities. The reserved Sampras was known for his serve and crafty volleys; the long-haired, neon-wearing Agassi wore down opponents with accurate returns and counter-punching.         
	Sampras led their head-to-head 20 to 14, including 4 to 1 in Grand Slam finals, the last being Sampras four-set victory in the 2002 US Open final.         
	The two former No. 1s have 124 career titles and 22 Grand Slams between them  Agassi has eight and Sampras 14. Agassi is one of only six men to have won all four majors and also won Olympic gold in Atlanta in 1996. Sampras 14 Slams was a record until Federer won Wimbledon this year, bringing the Swiss stars tally to 15.

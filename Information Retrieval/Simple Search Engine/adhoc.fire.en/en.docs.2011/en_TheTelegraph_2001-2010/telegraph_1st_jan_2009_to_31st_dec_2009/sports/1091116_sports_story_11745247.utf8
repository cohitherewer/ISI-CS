     Ravi   Shastri                                              
	I am a right-arm medium pacer. How does one bowl the late swing? Please advise.         
	(Samir Mukherjee, 15, Calcutta-40)         
	It demands a good wrist position and solid action at the time of delivery.         
	I am an all-rounder. I remain very tense on the eve of a match. How does one relax?         
	(Swapan Saha, 17, Calcutta)         
	Think of all your strengths and be positive. Its good to be a little tense before a game.         
	I am a right-handed batsman. How does one get used to the bounce and pace of the wicket at the initial stages?         
	(Pratim Dutta, 18, Calcutta-22)         
	Be watchful and selective in your shot making and have a good backfoot game.         
	I am a medium-pacer. Whenever I try to deliver a yorker, the ball falls short of the right length. Please help.         
	(Rohit Biswas, 17, Howrah)         
	Keep focusing on the spot you want the ball to land and keep a steady head at the time of delivery.         
	 I am a right-handed batsman. I have a high backlift and that leads to problems when tackling short-pitched deliveries. Please help.         
	(Saikat Adhikary, 23, Guwahati)         
	Adjust your backlift so that you have extra time.         
	 How can one improve reflexes for close-in catching?         
	(Robin Chanda, 19, Calcutta)         
	It demands a lot of hard work and practice. Work on some physical drills as well as that improves agility and flexibility.         
	 Why do I always find it tough to regain my touch while batting after the off-season?         
	(Saikat Roy, 19, Calcutta-42)         
	Its only natural. Even the best will feel rusty. Its like a machine that needs some oil if not used for a long time.         
	I am a right-handed batsman. How does one play a spinner on a wicket where the ball is keeping low?         
	(Ramen Raha, 19, Agartala)         
	Dont lift your head and adjust your backlift and look to play forward more often than not.         
	I am an off-spinner and would like to know the ideal length for bowling an off break?         
	(Sanjoy Guha, 18, Calcutta)         
	Its where you draw the batsman forward without quite allowing him to drive.         
	I am a right-handed batsman. Is it wise to take guard outside the leg stump when facing leg spinners?         
	(Partha Pratim Datta, 23, Calcutta)         
	Not necessary. Normal guard is good enough. You can think of it if the ball is turning alarmingly.

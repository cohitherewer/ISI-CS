The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indian shuttlers take cautious approach
                                                     Indian shuttlers take cautious approach
                  Saina Nehwal                     
	Hyderabad: Saina Nehwal was on guard against lower ranked rivals, while Chetan Anand was not looking beyond the first round but Anup Sridhar was targeting the semis, as the Indian shuttlers geared up for the Yonex Sunrise Indian Open Grand Prix that rolls out here on Wednesday.         
	Second seeded Saina, with a relatively easy draw and home conditions, is undoubtedly a hot favourite at the event but the Indian, who opens her campaign against unseeded Chew Yen Daphane Ng of Malaysia, is not taking her opponents lightly as their game is unknown to her.         
	I have never played against her (Chew). I dont know her game. I dont know her weakness or strength, so I am not setting any targets as such. It is an important tournament for me and I know it would be tough, said Saina.         
	There are some good players like Julia (Pei Xian Wong), Maria (Kristin Yulianti) and others. Each of them is good. The first two rounds are okay and I know people expect me to win. One may say that I have a 60 per cent chance of winning because they are lower ranked than me but I wont take any player lightly, she said.         
	Meanwhile, Chetan will be up against a lesser known Chong Chieh Lok of Malaysia in the first round but the world No. 12 Indian doesnt want to put pressure on himself and has avoided a look at the draw.         
	I dont want to put unnecessary pressure on myself thinking about what would happen if I get past Chong. For the last one year, I have been focussed only on the game at hand and it has helped me to concentrate more and get the results, so this time also it wont be any different, Chetan said.         
	I have not played against the Malaysian, nor do I know his game and I am not even thinking about that because I would rather think about my own strength and weakness than thinking about his game. Maybe just before the match, I will see him and play my game accordingly.         
	Struggling with form after returning to the court after a five-month injury layoff, Anup Sridhar will look to regain his confidence and has set his eyes on the semi-finals.         
	I think it would be good if I can win 2-3 matches. As far as results go, I would think that semi-final and above would be good, and I think its realistic as well, Sridhar said ahead of his first round match against a qualifier.         
	Among the other Indians in fray, national champion Arvind Bhatt will face Pengyu Du of China, while Gurusai Datt RMV will meet French Brice Leverdez and 16th seed Anand Pawar will lock horns with a qualifier in the main draw on Wednesday.         
	Indian mixed doubles pair of V Diju and Jwala Gutta will open their campaign on Thursday. Jwala will team up with Shruti Kurian for her womens doubles match.           (PTI)

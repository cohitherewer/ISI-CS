            Cricket Briefs                
	 Karachi: Pakistan manager Yawar Saeed has denied reports that Indian bookmakers approached his players in Colombo and rubbished speculation that match-fixing could be behind the teams Test and ODI series debacle in Sri Lanka.         
	It is absolutely rubbish that any match fixing could have taken place or that Indian bookmakers had approached our players, he said.  
	Pak injuries  
	 Karachi: Pakistan pacer Umar Gul and all-rounder Abdul Razzaq were on Wednesday ruled out of the remaining two matches of the ODI series against Sri Lanka. Gul is suffering from an ankle injury and Razzaq has a thigh strain.   
	Younis claim  
	 Karachi: Pakistan captain Younis Khan has dismissed reports that he was running a one-man show in the team and had assured the role of a dictator. I really dont know from where all these stories are coming from. Because I can safely say I am not a dictator. I consult everyone before taking decisions, Younis said from Colombo on Wednesday.  
	Swann ball  
	London: England off-spinner Graeme Swann rates the ball with which he castled Ricky Ponting in the Edgbaston Test as the most satisfying delivery of his career, something he can tell his grandchildren about with considerable pride. Ill never tire of talking about it and Im sure my grandkids will get the full story in 30 years time, said Swann.  
	Laxman shines  
	Northampton: VVS Laxmans unbeaten 37-ball 38 scripted Lancashires eight-wicket win over Northamptonshire in a rain-marred Pro40 Division Two match. Put into bat, Northamptonshire managed 102 for seven.  
	Alps venue  
	 Mumbai: Cricket is all set to touch a new high as the Europes longest glacier in Alps will soon host an exhibition match between two all-star teams from India and England at an altitude of 11,330 feet.         
	Indian team will include Kapil Dev, Roger Binny, Anshuman Gawekwad, Sandeep Patil and Ajay Jadeja, while the opponent will have Chris Broad, John Emburey, Dean Jones and Geoff Howarth.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi : Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was presented with a mace by the International Cricket Council (ICC) on Sunday for his team reaching the top of the Test rankings.         
	Later, the Indian captain said his team would strive to play hard and attractive cricket next year in order to hold on to their top spot.         
	I am not sure how many Test matches we will play next year but we will certainly play more than four as there are some proposed Tests, said Dhoni.         
	But then, the Future Tours Program (FTP) has been designed after lot of consultations and if an unscheduled series is organised between two tours, it becomes difficult for players, said Dhoni while receiving the mace from the ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat.         
	The skipper also praised Virender Sehwags ability to dominate any attack right from the start which makes him a special player.         
	He plays positive cricket and that also adds to other players confidence. Thats one of the reasons why their presence is so much important for the team, said the skipper.

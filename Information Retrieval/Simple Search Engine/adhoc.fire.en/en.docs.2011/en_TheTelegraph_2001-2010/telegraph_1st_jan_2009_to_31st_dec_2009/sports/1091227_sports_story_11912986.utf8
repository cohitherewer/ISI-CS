            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Despite the series loss, Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara said at a press conference Saturday that there were some positives for his team in the fact that a bunch of youngsters have made their presence felt.               
	The following are excerpts         
	What made the difference between the two teams         
	There wasnt any huge difference between the sides. In both the sides, the batsmen dominated while the bowlers were patchy. Unfortunately, we didnt have our full-strength bowling unit while India had their frontline bowlers. That made the difference.         
	If the Indian middle-order was better than Sri Lanka         
	Its difficult to say that the middle-order made the difference. I think most of our middle-order batsmen did reasonably well in the limited opportunities they had.         
	Performance of the youngsters in the team         
	Im happy with the way these youngsters have performed. They lacked experience but served us well. (Suranga) Lakmal, Thissara Perera and Suraj Randiv  three of our best bowlers were debutants!         
	Sanath Jayasuriyas role         
	Since the 1996 World Cup he has gone on to turn one-day cricket upside down with his batting. He is such a valuable player that we noticed the team was over-dependent on him. Thats both the positive and negative side of having a player of his calibre. Its important now to move on and try to win matches without him and that doesnt undermine his value in the team.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chance for Bagan to redeem themselves 
                                                     Chance for Bagan to redeem themselves 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bhaichung Bhutia                           
	Gurgaon: Just days after losing out to Churchill Brothers in their quest for a double in the domestic circuit, Mohun Bagan will once again cross swords with the Goa outfit in their Super Cup match Sunday. The Super Cup is the annual season ending match in the All-India Football Federation (AIFF) calendar, played between the I-League champions and the winners of the Federation Cup.         
	Although the one-off tie is generally regarded more a platform for distributing I-League awards than a competitive match, the encounter on Sunday at the Devi Lal Stadium could offer Bagan the perfect chance to redeem some of their lost prestige.         
	Things have surely not gone Bagans way the past couple of weeks. After surrendering meekly to Mahindra United in the concluding I-League match in Delhi, the green and maroon brigade lost 0-6 to Al Kuwait in the AFC Cup match at Kuwait City.         
	Our boys are simply exhausted, said Karim Bencharifa. In the last 10 days, we have travelled nearly six days. Its not easy to play good football under such circumstances, added the Bagan coach.         
	Yet, Karim was hopeful that his team would prove a point. In the I-League, we played Churchill twice, winning once and losing the next. This time we will go all out to beat them on a neutral venue, he said.         
	Other than goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee and defender Peter Odafe, both injured, Bagan will be in full force.         
	Skipper Bhaichung Bhutia, who scored a spectacular hattrick for Mohun Bagan in the Super Cup against Dempo at the same venue two years ago, will once again lead the attack along with mercurial Brazilian Jose Barreto.         
	Churchill Brothers have come with their full side that includes Nigerian striker Odafe Okolie, who has become a part of Indian soccer folklore with his prolific scoring.         
	It is no secret that Odafe, who had a tiff with Karim when the latter was the Churchill coach, makes it a point to give his best against Bagan.

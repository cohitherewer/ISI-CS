The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Himmat has bright future, says Choi
                                                   Himmat has bright future, says Choi
                      
	Sentosa: Himmat Rai may have missed his maiden Asian Tour title by a whisker but his third place finish in Iskandar Johor Open was enough to impress Korean stalwart and eventual winner KJ Choi, who predicted a bright future for the 22-year-old Indian.         
	Rai pushed Choi, a seven-time winner on the US PGA Tour, all the way in Malaysia Sunday before settling for a share of the third place.         
	While disappointed that he failed to pull off a giant-killing feat, Rai earned a measure of consolation as his cheque of $55,150 virtually secured his Asian Tour card for next season.         
	Choi, an Asian Tour honorary member, was thoroughly impressed with the Indian and predicted Rai would make it to the US PGA Tour if he can maintain his progress.         
	Himmat is a very good player. He is a long hitter and has a lot of control. The only thing that I would point out is that he has the tendency to hit it too fast but overall he has a good game, said Choi. I told him that he definitely has to come over to the US PGA Tour because he has the game to excel.         
	The only thing that would set him apart is the mental game.         
	As long as he can make his mental game stronger and work on some of his weakness like the tempo of his swing, I think he definitely can compete with the guys in the US, said the Korean.         
	Rai showed poise beyond his years to give himself a chance of winning his first Asian Tour title. He led into the third and final round in Johor but Choi overtook him with a fantastic closing round of 64.         
	The Indian is now ranked 46th on the Asian Tours Order of Merit with $75,986., with the top-65 players keeping their playing rights for next year. He now hopes to put his lessons to valuable use for the remainder of the season.         
	It feels good and satisfying to know that I played so well. Overall it has been a great tournament for me. Playing with KJ Choi and the amount that I learnt from him is unbelievable, Rai said.         
	His concentration is very good and he hit some really great shots. Having played so well, Im beginning to feel much more confident about my game. Im just looking forward to playing on the Asian Tour and playing my heart out, added the Indian.         
	Meanwhile, Thongchai Jaidee of Thailand lead the race to become Asias No. 1 with his haul of $869,872. (PTI)

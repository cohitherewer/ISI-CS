The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Subhas: Not easy to beat us at home 
                                                   Subhas: Not easy to beat us at home 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: You couldnt miss the sarcasm in East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmicks tone after the I-League match against JCT at the Barasat Stadium on Friday.         
	So we have saved the relegation, huh! he asked the mediapersons at the post-match press conference. All those talk of relegation were cooked up by the media and now you people have to eat your own words, Subhas did not seem to be in a mood to relent.         
	I have told you before and am saying again now, that with 24 points we cant be relegated.         
	Make no mistake. There are too many teams at 22 and 23 points. Now what happens to JCT? They came here thinking they can log full points. Its not so easy to beat East Bengal in their own den, he said.         
	Refusing to divulge his plans for the next season, Subhas said: We still have a match against Dempo coming up. Let the season end first... I will take a call sometime later.         
	So what about the Dempo match? We are taking rest till April 10. Will give it a thought after that. But one thing is for sure we will go for three points. Thirty points wont look bad on the league table, no!         
	Once again, Subhass sarcasm was too apparent.

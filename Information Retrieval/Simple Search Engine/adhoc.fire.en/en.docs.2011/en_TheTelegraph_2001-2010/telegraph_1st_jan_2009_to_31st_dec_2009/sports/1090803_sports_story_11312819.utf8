                                                   Lee hopes to be fit for 4th Test
                      
	Birmingham: Recuperating from a rib injury, Australian fast bowler Brett Lee is hoping to hit the peak of his pace by next week to reclaim his place in the squad for the fourth Ashes Test at Headingley.         
	Lee suffered a side strain just before the Cardiff Test, which eventually sidelined him for the first three Tests, and the lanky pacer is hoping to be back in the reckoning in the fouth Test.         
	I want to be going flat out by day five here (in Birmingham) so Ive got two more days, Lee told an Australian cricket channel.         
	I had a really good bowl today (Sunday), go a little bit harder tomorrow (Monday) then hard on the fifth day and hopefully be back by full pace then, he added.         
	Lee said he is feeling better as there was no pain in the injured area. Its been challenging to say the least but things are starting to fall into place now, he said.         
	The bodys starting to feel really good, Ive got no pain there in the left rib region.         
	Australias most experienced bowler Lee with 310 scalps from 76 Tests made his last appearance in the forgettable Boxing Day Test where he carried a foot injury and battled against South Africa.

                                                   Vettori: Have to take chances
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Wellington: New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori said his team would not shy away from taking risks if it promises victory in the third and final Test against India. Trailing the seies 0-1, Vettori said the Black Caps wouldnt mind taking risks like a sporting declaration when it came to squaring the series.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	If the pitch suits New Zealands plans         
	Ive never seen a Basin wicket like this in my life so Ill say its not (doesnt fit the bill), but that isnt to say its not a good Test match wicket. Well have to wait and see because I havent seen a Basin wicket as brown as this or as dry or as hard as this before.         
	How the wicket will play         
	Because I cant get a read on it, its difficult to say how it will play. Jeetan (Patel) has played on it and he said it had a bit of bounce and didnt do much and was a pretty good batting wicket as the game went on. You normally expect the Basin wicket to have a bit in it. It settles down Days two and three are pretty good batting days and then theres some inconsistent bounce later on. It doesnt really turn here. Thats why there were expectations that this might suit us. We have to wait and see.         
	What will NZ do if they win the toss?
     Probably bowl first. If we could dismiss India relatively cheaply first up, if the conditions suit it, then the nature of the Basin wicket with it tending to flatten out, that would be the way. Probably when we have won Tests at the Basin, that rsquo;s traditionally what we have done.               
	The conditions         
	Theres probably going to be one or two days when the wind picks up. But if you do well in those conditions, you know youve worked pretty hard for it. Ive seen in Tests before at the Basin that generally the teams that have done the tough days well have gone on to win the Test.         
	If NZ are prepared to make a sporting declaration to win the last Test         
	With Sehwag out there? (laughs) We have to go out with that mentality. Its not a line of thinking I always think along, but we realise a 1-1 series would be a great result for us, so any opportunity that we have to win the Test match I think we have to take. If that means putting ourselves under pressure with loss, yeah, well definitely go down that road.         
	Should the home team have a say in the preparation of the pitch?         
	We get asked about what we want from a wicket but its still the groundsmans prerogative to produce the wicket he wants to. When a team from the subcontinent comes to town we generally want a wicket with a bit of bounce in it.         
	The inconsistency of the NZ team         
	The inconsistency of us as a Test side has already been seen in this series, so we have to address that and talk about it. Ill just keep asking the guys the same things I asked them before the Napier Test match, which is doing things for longer periods. We saw a couple of batsmen really step up Jesse (Ryder) and Ross (Taylor) and then Brendon (McCullum) later on. I was pretty pleased with the majority of the bowlers through those three days in the field so if I can see more of that Ill be pleased. But therell probably be a few times during the Test match when well have to push a little bit harder and take some chances.         
	The preparation going into the last Test         
	Bit of rest involved for the fast bowlers, but apart from that its been pretty regulation for a Test match. Bit of talk about how important it is to win this game and enjoy the series, and a lot of that depends on the wicket and even the overhead conditions tomorrow, about what we need to do. We obviously need to bowl India out pretty early on to set us up and give us a chance.         
	The composition of the NZ team         
	I suppose we work through all permutations. But Ive been impressed with how James (Franklin) has bowled. Hes been unlucky. That he hasnt taken wickets, I know, has disappointed him but talking to the guys behind the stumps, theyve been impressed with the way the balls been coming through and thats an encouraging sign. So I would say he would make the team, we just have to figure out the rest of the balance. Once again Jeetan bowled exceptionally well in the last Test, but like always it will come down to him or the extra seamer.

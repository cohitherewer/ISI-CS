	Tokyo: Toyota withdrew from Formula One with immediate effect on Wednesday, leaving Japan without a team in motorsports premier series.         
	Company president Akio Toyoda apologised for the teams failure to record a single race victory since joining F1 in 2002 despite an estimated annual budget of around $300 million.         
	It was a very difficult but unavoidable decision, Toyota told a news conference in Tokyo. Since last year, as the economic climate worsened, we have been struggling with the question of whether to continue in F1.         
	We are pulling out of Formula One completely. I offer my deepest apologies to Toyotas many fans for not being able to achieve the results we had targeted.         
	The decision, by the worlds largest carmaker to quit the glamour sport comes as the auto industry starts to stabilise following a sales crunch in the wake of the financial crisis.         
	Cologne-based Toyotas departure as a team and engine supplier deals another major blow to the sport after Japans No. 2 carmaker Honda quit the series last December.         
	It leaves Japan without a team in F1 and continues the drain of Japanese companies from motorsport, which has seen Subaru and Suzuki withdraw from the world rallying championship.         
	Toyota, whose team principal Tadashi Yamashina was in tears at Wednesdays news conference, compiled 13 podium and 87 points finishes over its eight seasons in Formula One.         
	Meanwhile on Wednesday, Formula Ones governing body will review the legality of Toyotas pullout from the sport.           (REUTERS)

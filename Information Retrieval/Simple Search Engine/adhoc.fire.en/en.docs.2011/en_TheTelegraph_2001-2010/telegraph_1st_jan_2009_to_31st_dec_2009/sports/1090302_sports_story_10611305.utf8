                                                     Perfect 10 by Suvadip
            A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta: Suvadip Kumar Sinha, who bowls right-arm off-break, scripted a rare feat by claiming all 10 wickets in an innings in a CAB first division match.         
	Suvadip, who plays for Belgachia United, scalped all Dakshin Kalikata Sansad (DKS) wickets on Sunday in a relegation play-off second round match at the Rajasthan ground.         
	The 21-year old spinner from Asansol never looked threatening till lunch. But after the break, he ripped apart DKSs batting during their chase of 316 on Day II of the tie.         
	Finally, Belgachia won the match by six runs.         
	I just tried to bowl in the right areas. It feels nice when you achieve such a feat. I have bagged seven wickets earlier this season but getting 10 wickets is simply great, Suvadip said.         
	The right-arm off-spinner, who is playing his first season in the CAB first division league, has bagged 26 wickets from 10 matches.         
	With Sundays feat, he became the third Bengal cricketer to achieve the coveted mark after Premangshu Chatterjee and Pulak Majumdar.

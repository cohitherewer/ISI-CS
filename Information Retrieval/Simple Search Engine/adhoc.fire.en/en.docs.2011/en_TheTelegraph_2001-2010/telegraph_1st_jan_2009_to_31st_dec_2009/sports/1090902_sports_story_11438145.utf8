The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Arnatta gets another chance
                                                                                                               Arnatta gets another chance
            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singhs failed favourite, Arnatta, deserves another chance to prove her mettle in Wednesdays race card. The four-year-old filly, by Placerville out of Mitzvah, was taken by surprise, in her last outing, by Top Of The Class, who went on to record another victory. Now that Arnatta is up against a moderate opposition in the 1,100 Thrifty Allan Cup, she is expected to win in the hands of jockey C. Alford. However, most of Arnattas rivals in the field have tried to nullify their handicap disadvantage through the services of apprentices. It may turn out to be another exciting contest.

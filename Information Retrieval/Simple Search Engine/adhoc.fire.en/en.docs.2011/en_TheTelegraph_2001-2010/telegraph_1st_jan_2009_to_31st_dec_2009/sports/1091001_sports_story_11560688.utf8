The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ravi Shastri calls for fresh faces
                                                   Ravi Shastri calls for fresh faces
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Johannesburg: Former India captain and cricket manager Ravi Shastri has urged the national selectors to immediately identify 10 youngsters and to start giving them exposure.         
	The selectors (headed by Krishnamachari Srikkanth) have to quickly start thinking of the 2011 World Cup and begin to rotate from within a pool of, say, 25 players, he told The Telegraph after a ragged Team Indias first-round exit in the Champions Trophy.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. had failed to make the semi-finals of the World T20, in June, too.         
	Shastri added: I dont think this committee has selected anybody new besides Abhishek Nayar... It cant keep recycling the players chosen by the previous committee (headed by Dilip Vengsarkar)... I refuse to believe we dont have talent.         
	According to Shastri, the selectors must stop picking Ishant Sharma for limited overs cricket, be it the 50-over game or the T20, till his confidence comes back.         
	For the time being, play Ishant in Tests only... From bowling at 140-plus, hes down to 128-130... His confidence has to return and that wont happen through limited overs cricket... A Praveen Kumar, on the other hand, should regularly be fielded, he said.         
	Shastri added: Rotating the quicks has to be an absolute priority... Otherwise, were heading for trouble.         
	Asked whether it was time for, among others, to blood Bengal wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha, he replied: Why not? Youve got to give exposure when the player in question is doing well... Id look at young Manish Pandey, who batted so fearlessly (for Royal Challengers Bangalore) in the closing stages of this years IPL...         
	The seniors, Shastri pointed out, had a role to play, but must be rotated.         
	Our next engagement is at home  the seven-match ODI series against Australia.

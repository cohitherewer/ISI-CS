                                                     Trying to find newer peaks to climb, says Abhinav Bindra
    - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 
  -  BEIJING GOLD IS A THING OF THE PAST FOR ACE MARKSMAN             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Abhinav Bindra                                 
	Calcutta: Abhinav Bindra, Indias only individual gold medallist (10m air rifle) in the Olympics, spoke to The Telegraph in the lead up to completing a year as the history-scripting hero. That the 26-year-old (Bindra turns 27 next month) is actually a champion with a difference came through once more.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q August 11, 2008, is when you created history... A few days remain for a year to be completed. How do you look back on this period?         
	A It has been a fascinating journey... It has given me some time to reflect on my 15 years in sport. I have tried to understand what turning my dreams into reality has meant to my internal being and have understood what my achievement has meant to the country... Reflecting, on a personal level, there has been huge satisfaction and pride at the end result, but the journey towards it, my years of complete devotion to the sport and the courage shown through the ups and downs, is what has given me the real kick or high... The gold medal was only the outcome. Indeed, I climbed a mountain and, then, found nothing there! Now that I am on the top of the mountain, I realise the only way forward is down. So, in order to move ahead and progress, I am starting to forget about my glorious past and trying to find newer peaks to climb.         
	Has life changed in the past 12 months?         
	Life has changed dramatically in that the only goal I had for a majority of my existence has been achieved. So, one has to start the process, the journey and the struggle again. In terms of fame, it has not made much of a difference to me at all. For I never did this for fame... It was out of pure passion. I have always disliked fame. It is, in my view, very overrated.         
	Today, has the urge to compete again been rekindled?         
	Yes and no! Transition takes time and I will let nature take its own course. But, when I look at it in the way that I described in my first answer (moving away from the glorious past), the desire increases.         
	Just how regularly are you practising?         
	I have been training for the last six months, which has included trips to Germany, and I am shooting great results. However, that (alone) is not important to me any more... I am looking to improve my performances, thats the bottom line.         
	World champion and Olympic champion at the same time... It cant get better than this... What, then, could really motivate you?         
	Sure, it certainly cannot get better. That way, I am living a dream! I would never ever have asked for anything more when I started. The motivation will come back by moving away from the achievement(s), getting down the mountain and, then, going up again... It is the simple law of nature.         
	Youve talked of an inner voice...         
	My answers to your questions reflect that inner voice.         
	The other medal winners from India in Beijing havent really consistently excelled after that. Have they, perhaps, been distracted?         
	Cannot say... It is about ones outlook towards life and there is no right or wrong in this. Winning medals at the Olympics is a huge, huge achievement, so one must continue to give them that respect. There may be reasons for getting distracted, if at all. I assume that they might want to try and make a better life... Priorities in life (can) change.         
	How have you been able to keep away from the distractions? Did you have to make a conscious effort?         
	Well, as I have said, I dislike fame. So, it has been pretty easy!         
	Coming from a privileged background, has it been easier to handle success?         
	It is not at all about being from a privileged background, it is about the values your parents give and teach you. In that respect, I have been absolutely privileged and blessed.         
	Your message to achievers whove had to struggle...         
	(Laughs) You assume I have not had to struggle... Every achiever has to go through that phase. As for advice, I will say that the struggle part will be there, so accept it and enjoy it.         
	Given Indias obsession with cricket, have you, at a personal level, been able to do anything about the Olympic disciplines  either by way of spreading awareness or helping somebody with potential?         
	I have tried my utmost to spread the importance of Olympic sport. I have spoken very strongly, at every opportunity, about the needs of our very talented athletes, the importance of professionalism and the need for an Olympic programme. It has not gone down well with many people and I have put my neck on the line and made things much tougher for myself. But, then, I have no regrets. I am very proud that I have stood up and spoken about the realities and the importance of moving on (after his gold in Beijing). I am committed to continue doing so.         
	You seem to be an anti-Establishment kind of a person...         
	I am not, nor do I have anything against any individual. I just am very, very passionate about Indian sport and am very, very keen to see our athletes get trained to world-class standards, be handled efficiently and be given the respect for what they do... To succeed at the world-level demands a lot... In methods, the world is way too advanced... We need to catch up if we want to succeed and we definitely need a vision for our athletes... They must always come first in any scheme of things... What is important is an understanding of the synergy between sports performances and science. If that is missing, I will voice it. My wish is for the country to have many, many gold medallists.         
	Unlike most other achievers in sport, youve been calling for major investments in infrastructure across India. Are you disappointed that nothing tangible has been done?         
	Disappointed to some extent, but I have not given up.         
	Whats your vision?         
	To see our athletes get every opportunity to nurture their talent, have the best systems in place for them to prepare... Results will follow, but one has to stick to it.         
	Generally, are Indian sportspersons afraid of failure and is the public too harsh on those who dont get it right?         
	Everybody in the world is afraid of failure. I am sure you too are in your profession... It is a part of life, one has to accept it... In sport, specifically, you win some and you lose some. Failure to me is a stepping stone to success... I have learnt much, much more from my failures than my successes... Indian athletes are no different to athletes from overseas, they just need to understand the synergy of sport with more sensitivity and that will help them. The same goes for the public.         
	Have you been afraid of failure?         
	Sure, I have been. But I have accepted it... It is no crime to fail.         
	What did your failure in Athens (2004 Olympics) teach you?         
	It gave me the killer instinct. For me, that was to detach myself from the end result.         
	Has the past year taught you something?         
	Yes, a lot! It has taught me more about life outside the world of sport. For 14 years before Beijing, I had dedicated myself fully to sport, having spent more than 16,000 hours training... In the last 12 months, I have seen a lot more of the real world...         
	Do you continue to follow Tiger Woodss career?         
	Yes... A lot of sport in general as well.         
	Youve probably been asked this before, but what goes into the making of a champion sportsman or sportswoman?         
	Passion, courage and work, work and work! You have to be totally focussed towards your goals.         
	How will you be celebrating on August 11?         
	(Laughs) I appreciate the media remembering the date, but I have not thought of anything... It is simply a landmark in my life and life itself is a celebration I should be in (hometown) Chandigarh         
	Theres talk that youll be inducted into the Territorial Army with the rank of an honorary Major. Excited?         
	Will be an honour. The details have not been communicated and, so, I will not be able to say more.         
	Lastly... Your father, Apjit, ran into problems recently. Just how much did that affect you?         
	It was the business-related issue of a sick company... It has been sorted out, with agreements in place... Defaults often happen and, in this case, the reasons were beyond our control. Of course, the way one side of the story was portrayed was ugly... My father, though, has immense courage and has been a fighter all his life. He has done no wrong and I am sure, in the course of time, things will be clearer vis--vis the legal process. It has been a very hard time, yes, but my family and I will only come out of this stronger. I have that confidence.

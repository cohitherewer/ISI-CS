	Guwahati: Shillongs Lajong FC qualified for the semi-finals of the 31st Federation Cup despite playing out a 1-1 draw with Pune FC in their group D encounter on Sunday.         
	Lajong qualified as Dempo Sports Club beat Air-India 2-0 in the final group league match later in the evening. Peter Carvalho and Climax Lawrence scored for the Goan outfit in the 21st and 86th minute respectively.         
	Earlier, Lajong surged ahead in the 31st minute when a long throw-in from the wide right landed in the Pune FC box.         
	As the Pune FC defenders dithered in clearing the ball, Lajongs Kirshan Lyngshing lurking made the most of the lapse to shoot his team ahead.         
	However, the joy was shortlived when their forward Anil Gurung handled the ball inside the box.         
	Referee Adley Costa had no hesitation in awarding a penalty to Pune FC which was easily converted by Douhou Pierre in the 41st minutes to level the proceedings.         
	The Goans were on an attacking spree right from the word go and found the lead through Curualho when his header off a cross from the left flank went past custodian Kunal Sawant into the net.         
	Leading 1-0, Dempo continued to press for another goal and their efforts paid off when in the 86th minute Climax made it 2-0.         
	Air India goalkeeper Sawant managed to fist away an attempt by Jaoquim Abranches and Climax, who was lurking nearby tapped it home.

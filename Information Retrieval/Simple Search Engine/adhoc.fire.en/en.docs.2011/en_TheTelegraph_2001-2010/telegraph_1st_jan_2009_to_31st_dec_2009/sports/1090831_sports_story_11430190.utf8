	Mumbai: Wasim Akram and John Wright were interviewed by the Kolkata Knight Riders management on Sunday for the top job left vacant by John Buchanans sacking.         
	Besides the two, former India players Sandip Patil and Praveen Amre also presented their credentials to the KKR bosses at the franchises principal owner Shah Rukh Khans residence here.         
	The franchise is not expected to make an official statement in a hurry on who would take over the reins from Buchanan, who had been the Knight Riders head of cricket operations.         
	[I met Shah Rukh and Sourav and had discussions with them in a very friendly atmosphere. I am not just looking at becoming the bowling coach for the KKR team but also to be their cricket consultant, Akram said, adds PTI.]         
	Dont expect a decision right now. Please give us a few days, team director Joy Bhattacharjya said.         
	The team had earlier said that they were looking to have a coach appointed by the end of August.         
	KKR had earlier interviewed Duncan Fletcher, Dermot Reeve, Richard Pybus, Michael Bevan, Matthew Mott, WV Raman, Lalchand Rajput and Ashok Malhotra.

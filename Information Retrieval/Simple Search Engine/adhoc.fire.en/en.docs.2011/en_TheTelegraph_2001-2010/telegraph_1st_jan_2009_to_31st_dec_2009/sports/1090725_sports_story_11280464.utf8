The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vaas sets sight on ODI berth
                                                   Vaas sets sight on ODI berth
                      
	Colombo: Chaminda Vaas, who just retired from Test cricket, vowed to fight for his place in Sri Lankas one-day International squad after selectors left him out of a 15-member squad for the five-match series against Pakistan.         
	The selectors named the squad Friday, when the 35-year-old bowler concluded his last Test with 355 wickets in 111 matches.         
	I knew it from the start, Vaas said of his exclusion. I had not played 11 months of one-day cricket. All the young fast bowlers who played during that time played very well and took their opportunities with both hands.         
	I am going to work hard I am going to fight for my place. Ill be back very soon.         
	Vaas has played 322 one-day Internationals with 400 wickets. He made his last appearance against India last August.         
	Despite retiring from Tests, he plans to play one-dayers and Twenty20 Internationals until the 2011 World Cup, to be played in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. (AP)

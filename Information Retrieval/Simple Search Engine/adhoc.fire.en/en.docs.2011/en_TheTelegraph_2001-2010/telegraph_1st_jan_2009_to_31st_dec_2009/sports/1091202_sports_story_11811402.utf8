The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Svidler wins, So holds Malakhov 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Svidler wins, So holds Malakhov 
                      
	Khanty Mansiysk: Russian Peter Svidler raised his game when it mattered the most, beating Spaniard Alexei Shirov in his first pre-quarter final game of the World Chess Cup.         
	Svidler, who came to the last-16 stage after a marathon struggle against German Arkadij Naiditsch in the previous round, had to find many correct moves against a menacing looking Shirov before he could win with his black pieces.         
	The win gave Svidler a decisive advantage in the mini-match comprising two games initially. The Russian needs just a draw in the return game with white pieces to go through to the quarters. Filipino Wesley So played out a draw with another higher ranked player Vladimir Malakhov of Russia in a tense game.         
	So will have black pieces in the return game, a colour with which he has been making waves here.         
	Apart from Svidler, the only other winner of the day was two-time world junior champion Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan who outwitted Viktor Laznicka in a keenly contested game.         
	Mamedyarov won which means he has a safe passage to the quarters barring a debacle in the return game.         
	Out of the eight games in pre-quarters, only two were decisive  three short draws while the rest had the few spectators glued to their chair.         
	Svidler made the most of his opportunities against Shirov in a full-bloodied game arising out of a Grunfeld defence. (AGENCIES)

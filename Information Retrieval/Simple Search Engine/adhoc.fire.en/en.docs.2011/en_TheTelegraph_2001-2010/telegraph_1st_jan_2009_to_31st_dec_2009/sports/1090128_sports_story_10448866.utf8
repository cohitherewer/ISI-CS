The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India need 5-0 win to stay in race
                                                   India need 5-0 win to stay in race
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A 5-0 whitewash against Sri Lanka in the ensuing one-day International series would see Team India make an interesting three-horse race for the top spot in the Reliance Mobile ICC ODI Championship rankings.         
	According to an ICC release on Monday, in such case, India will get 123 rating points, equal to that of South Africa, which is, however, three less than Australia (126). This calculation was done after South Africas win over Australia in the fourth ODI on Monday.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhonis team could even go top of the rankings if they win all the matches in Sri Lanka and then win the first ODI in the series against New Zealand early in March.         
	But if they lose 0-5 to Mahela Jayawardene amp; Co. they would slip below New Zealand (113) to the fifth position. Such a result would catapult Sri Lanka (107) to the third spot.         
	RANKINGS         
	1. Australia (126); 2. South Africa (123); 3. India (119); 4. New Zealand (113); 5. Pakistan (111); 6. England (108); 7. Sri Lanka (107); 8. West Indies (91); 9. Bangladesh (46); 10. Ireland (19).

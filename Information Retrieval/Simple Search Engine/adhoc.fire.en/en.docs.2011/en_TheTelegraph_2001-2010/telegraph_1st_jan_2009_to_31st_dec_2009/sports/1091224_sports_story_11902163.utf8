The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I live in the present and have accepted the reality: Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                        I live in the present and have accepted the reality: Dhoni
    - Team Indias regular captain completes five years of international cricket           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni                                 
	Calcutta: Wednesday wasnt quite like any other day for Mahendra Singh Dhoni, for it marked the completion of five years as an India cricketer.         
	The regular captain, though, wasnt with his players here. Instead, he was at home in Ranchis Harmu area.         
	Its not that Dhoni wanted to be away from the Sachin Tendulkars, but the two-match ban for a pathetic over-rate in Nagpur ensured that he couldnt play in Cuttack (on Monday) and wouldnt be able to take the field at the Eden, on Thursday.         
	Look, as you know, Im not one who lives in the past... I live in the present and have accepted the reality, which is that Im having to sit out two ODIs... In fact, I accepted it quickly... Im the positive sort and am looking ahead, a relaxed sounding Dhoni told The Telegraph on Wednesday evening.         
	Driving to meet Jharkhand State Cricket Association president Amitabh Choudhary, he added: Ive tried to use this forced break in the best manner possible... Its not that Ive been regularly going out to eat or something, but Ive been spending time with childhood friends... Ive been touching base with others, too.         
	Asked if hed watched the Cuttack ODI, which India won by seven wickets, Dhoni replied: Saw the entire Sri Lanka innings and (stand-in captain) Virender Sehwags start... I wanted to see if there was dew, for the spinners wouldnt then be able to grip the ball well... It was there and I knew we would make it. In any case, Im not a great watcher...         
	Of course, he makes others watch.         
	Well, I dont pressurise them... Its their choice, Dhoni quipped.         
	Looking to Thursdays match in Calcutta, Dhoni said: We havent played at the Eden for a long time... I hope we win and wrap up the series...         
	The hope bit apart, whats his prediction?         
	Oops, thats tough... Its tough because I havent seen the wicket and cant gauge the dew factor from Ranchi... My message to the boys would be very simple  to keep doing what theyve been doing, Dhoni answered.         
	The regular captain isnt a great watcher, but because the series may be pocketed at the Eden itself, theres every chance that hell spend a good number of hours before the TV.         
	Before that, however, Dhoni intends completing a dialogue with Choudhary (a former Team India manager). The agenda: Improving the state of cricket in Jharkhand and reviewing matters associated with the upcoming stadium in the HEC Complex.

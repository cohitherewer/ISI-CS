                                                     Dhoni is doing fine: Gary
    - we want to dominate and play aggressive cricket: team india coach           A CORRESPONDENT            Gary Kirsten                                 
	Wellington: Gary Kirsten has backed his batsmen to play their natural game. The Team India coach said he encouraged the players to dominate and play aggressive brand of cricket. He also hoped Mahendra Singh Dhoni would be fit after missing the second Test because of a back injury.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Mahendra Singh Dhonis fitness         
	Hes been good. We are hoping he will be fit. We havent decided anything yet. But he is doing fine so far.         
	If the team was missing him         
	Hes always an important member. He is a fantastic player. He provides so much to the team, so it would be great to have him on board. We also feel that we have got other players who can do the job, but certainly would like to have MS as the captain He offers a lot as a batsman. Hed be of great value to any team in the world. We are hoping he will be fit.         
	The conditions         
	Very good conditions We are happy with the conditions.         
	The wicket         
	What they have done all through this tour is they have prepared good wickets. We can see there is going to be good bounce in it. Looks like a good cricket wicket.         
	But it is the performance that counts in the end         
	Absolutely... New Zealand have shown they were really competitive and they were well up in that last Test match. We had to use all our determination to save the game, which we did really well. We are looking forward to a good Test match.         
	If he was satisfied with the performance in the second Test         
	We had to bat cautiously on that fourth day. For me it was a remarkable performance.         
	The aggressive approach         
	We play that way. We play fair cricket. We like to take it on. We like to play aggressively, and there is a risk element in that. But we feel that the team is well balanced, and we can have guys who can bat periods of time as well. But we certainly encourage our guys to take the ball on and to dominate and play aggressive cricket.         
	The batsmen playing their natural game         
	These days everyone is talking about entertaining the crowds, we want to bat a little quicker. Also, to make up time in a game. So teams bat at 3.5-4 runs an over, as New Zealand showed in the last game. They got 600 and declared with 20 overs left on the second day. It saves a huge amount of time if you bat quicker.         
	If the batsmen, at times, need to curb their natural instincts         
	I think we showed in this last Test that we can play two different kinds of cricket. I think its important that people try and play their natural game and play as positively as they can. But there might be situations where they have to play slightly differently and I think we did that really well.         
	If it was important to give the bowlers something to look forward to in a wicket         
	It is... I think its always important that you give the bowlers something in all the conditions. All bowlers love a bit of bounce. They feel if they get good bounce, and they have a good day, they can get something going in their favour.         
	If the cold conditions will be tough for the bowlers         
	Little bit cold for the Indian guys, but yeah we have adjusted pretty well. The guys are looking forward to it. There has been talk about the third Test within our camp. We have got a fair amount of rest watching the guys bat. So I think the bowlers are pretty keen to get out there.         
	If the conditions will prompt any change in plans         
	We will have to see when we get out there. Conditions look good certainly for the first few days, and we will have to see when we get out there. But yeah it does, it does effect things a little bit, but you can only make those decisions when on the field.         
	If the Indians will be content with a draw in the final Test         
	No... We dont want to play like that. We want to go and win every Test match, thats certainly going to be our intention.

	London: Newcastle were relegated from the Premier League after losing 1-0 at Aston Villa. The worst fears of Alan Shearer, the Magpies interim manager, looked to be coming true after a cruel deflection off Damien Duff gave Villa the lead six minutes before the break.         
	The goal completely changed the mood of the visiting fans who had been celebrating the fact that Manchester United had taken the lead against Newcastles relegation rivals Hull.         
	As expected, Sir Alex Ferguson named a weakened United side for the trip to the KC Stadium, but nobody could complain about the goal that put the Red Devils ahead, young midfielder Darron Gibson unleashing a screamer from 35 yards on the half-hour mark.         
	It proved to be the winner, but with Newcastle unable to find an equaliser at Villa Park, it was the Tigers who stayed up by a point with Shearers side having to contemplate the reality of life outside the top-flight.         
	The misery was complete for the Toon Army in injury time with David Edgar sent off just seconds before the final whistle which confirmed their fate.         
	Newcastle had chances, most notably when Villa goalkeeper Brad Friedel saved from Damien Duff early on and Steven Taylor had a shot blocked on the line shortly after, but could easily have conceded more.         
	The defeat, Alan Shearers fifth in eight games as manager, will cost Newcastle about $63.6 million in revenue next season and is likely to severely affect owner Mike Ashleys attempts to sell the club.         
	Second-bottom Middlesbrough will join the Magpies and already-relegated West Brom in the Coca-Cola Championship next year after they were defeated 2-1 at West Ham.         
	The hosts went ahead after 33 minutes when Carlton Cole sidefooted past Brad Jones and although Gary Neill hit an equaliser shortly after the break, the Hammers won it eight minutes later through Junior Stanislas.         
	Sunderland were the only other side in any danger of getting relegated at the start of play and had other results to thank for their survival after they were beaten 3-2 by Chelsea at the Stadium of Light in Guus Hiddinks last game in charge of the Blues.         
	Nicolas Anelka took the seasons Golden Boot award in style with a wonder strike two minutes into the second half before Kieran Richardson took advantage of Petr Cechs fumble to level.

                                                   I talk straight... Im not a diplomat: Younis Khan 
    - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 
  -  PAKISTAN CAPTAIN ON HIS BEING TARGETED AND MORE             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  
	Johannesburg: Pakistans captain Younis Khan, who led his team to the World T20 win this summer, spoke to The Telegraph in his room at the Sandton Sun here. The 31-year-old Younis, incidentally, has over 5,000 runs in both Tests and ODIs.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q How much did life change after winning the World T20?         
	A Id like to think that the win changed things in Pakistan, brought joy to a nation hit by blasts and suicide bombings... The win, I think, brought all of Pakistan together... Of course, life did change for us players, too... Everybody wanted to have a piece of us... Somebody like (Umar) Gul couldnt rest for three days, in Peshawar, as people kept coming to congratulate him...         
	What were your thoughts in the hours immediately after lifting the World T20 trophy on June 21?         
	That the team and I had achieved something big, the first major success on the world stage after the 1992 World Cup... Ek badi jeet ki zaroorat thi and we did it... Talking of myself, my CV improved... Looking back, the lap of honour at Lords was so emotional.         
	In a way, you did an Imran Khan...         
	(Enthusiastically) One of the TV channels showed footage where, after the win, Id enacted much of what had been done by Imranbhai at the MCG... It happened spontaneously.         
	Did you meet Imran on returning home with the World T20 trophy?         
	No, because we were at home for only a few days before heading to Sri Lanka and, then, Imranbhais so busy... However, I spoke to him from Sri Lanka.         
	What did Imran tell you?         
	That I shouldnt have retired from T20...         
	It seems you did make an impulsive decision... Were you irked by the criticism from the Abdul Qadirs?         
	I did feel hurt... If Qadir had such strong views about my playing in T20, he shouldve told me in person... I didnt have a problem with him during the time he was the chief selector... There were times when he covered up for me and I did the same for him... His comments did pain me, but its not unusual for former players in Pakistan and in India to be critical of todays lot... Some criticise for the sake of criticising, which is bad.         
	Was criticism the only reason?         
	The main reason... Id also been thinking that by continuing to play T20, Id be denying youngsters like Umar Akmal and Fawad Alam the chance to gain international exposure...         
	Would you have quit T20 had you lost the final (to Sri Lanka)?         
	Tab nahin... Something wouldve been left to prove then.         
	What went wrong in Sri Lanka... You lost the Test series 0-2 and the ODIs 2-3?         
	I hate making excuses, but the celebrations after the World T20 win left us little time and space to plan for the Sri Lanka tour... Also, during the Tests, we gave it away from positions of strength... Hona nahin chahiye tha, lekin ho gaya... In fact, we didnt adjust going into Tests straight after three weeks of T20. The good thing, not that it came as any consolation, was that we won the last two ODIs and the one-off T20 International.         
	Its strange that within weeks of leading Pakistan to the World T20 win, some began questioning your abilities as a captain...         
	(Laughs) Main ek seedha banda hoon and, like Imranbhai, I talk straight... Im not a diplomat and cant be one because, then, Id have to compromise whenever I wish to speak my mind... I believe that if I say something behind closed doors, then I should say the same thing outside, once the doors open... Six months ago, Shoaib Malik was the target... During and after Sri Lanka, I became the target... Kisi na kisi ko udana hai... (After a pause) Reading and hearing all that criticism without basis made me feel as if Id committed a crime by leading my country to the World T20 title... Jaise koi gunaah ho gaya.         
	How do you handle pressure, both from within and outside? After all, youre the leading batsman, too.         
	My approach is simple: When Im batting, Im a batsman only... Obviously, if I score big, the team benefits... I dont wear two hats when Im batting... Ive got to do well because, otherwise, how can I ask others to put up big scores? Its important for captains to lead from the front. I suppose Im calmer today.         
	What would be the best way to describe your style of captaincy?         
	My lines of communication with the players are always open... I encourage them to share their thoughts with me... I like the dressing room environment to be good... Mahaul achcha hona chahiye... I also keep telling the players that they must take plenty of pride in turning out for Pakistan.         
	Have you looked up to any captain?         
	My late brother Sharif Khan, whod captain the Steel Town Gymkhana, in Karachi... Rashid Latif, from whom I learnt a lot... And, of course, Imranbhai... In Pakistan, at different levels, captains have tried to model themselves on him.         
	What made Imran so special?         
	He had the ability to take bold decisions and to stand by them... He had such a presence and would put his own hand up, to do the job, in case others werent able to deliver.         
	Your impressions of Shahid Afridi, your deputy in ODIs and the T20 captain?         
	Afridi, by nature, is aggressive and positive... An aggressive player wont have problems captaining any team... The same cant be said of those who have a defensive mindset.         
	You dedicated the World T20 win to the late Bob Woolmer. How much of an influence did he have on your career?         
	(Emotionally) Lots... He helped me when the going wasnt good... Bob even taught me how to hold a fork and knife properly... Thats the relationship we had... It probably helped that, like him, I would be positive... When some started going after Bob, hed come to me and talk of his unhappiness... Id like to think I made him feel better.         
	The other day, you were watching The Mistress of Spices...         
	My No.1 hobby is fishing... I do a lot in Karachi... I do like watching movies, jo bhi achcha lag jaye... I really enjoyed Guru, which I could see only recently.         
	Finally... What do you tell young cricketers?         
	Be so strong, in your game and character, that your country benefits... Also, dont complain, but make the most of everything... There was a time when I didnt have enough money to pay the bus fare for club matches in Karachi... But, I didnt sit and cry, rather I worked towards becoming a self-made man... Apne aap kuch karna chahiye... Be strong from within.

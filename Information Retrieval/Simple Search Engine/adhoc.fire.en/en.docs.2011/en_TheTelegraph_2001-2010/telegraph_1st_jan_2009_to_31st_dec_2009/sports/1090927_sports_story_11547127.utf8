                                                   Fraternity hails Bhutia ruling
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Top footballers and coaches on Saturday welcomed the arbitrators decision to allow Bhaichung Bhutia to play for the club of his own choice.         
	While East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick said the interim relief was a verdict for the good of Indian football, Bhutias teammate in the national squad, NP Pradeep felt the striker should have been cleared long ago.         
	Bhutias presence will definitely make East Bengal stronger but I am looking at things from the national perspective, said Bhowmick. His absence from the field was a big blow for Indian football.         
	We have to accept the fact that Bhutia is an icon of Indian football. In the next couple of years, he will continue to be the key man in the Indian team. Those who tried to stop him from playing were only harming Indian football.         
	Pradeep was even more forthright in his views. It is a sin to stop a footballer from playing. I know how it likes to be without a salary. Last season, I was a victim of this and had to lose a months salary. I dont know why the matter was kept pending so long. Bhaichung should have been cleared long back.         
	Bhutias another national team colleague, Steven Dias said he was happy that a decision could come in favour of a footballer. I dont want to quote instances but on many occasions footballers found them at the receiving end for no fault of their own. Bhaichung was my hero from my younger days. Its a pity that the man who won us the Nehru Cup was not allowed to play for more than three months.         
	Former national coach Sukhwinder Singh said he was shocked to know that Bhutia was slapped with a six-month suspension for missing one exhibition match. That was too strong. Any attempt to deny a footballer from playing cannot be supported. I am happy to know that Bhaichung would be back in action soon, said the JCT coach.

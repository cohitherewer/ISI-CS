	Mysore: The S. Padmanabhan-trained Messalina is the one to beat in the 2,000m Poonawalla Mysore Derby, the blue riband event of the races here on Sunday.          
	Messalina, the winner of the Fillies Trial Stakes, recently in Hyderabad, looks to be out and out stayer. Her workouts over the Derby trip have also been impressive. Wayne Smith partners the Alnasr Alwasheek-Palazzio daughter.

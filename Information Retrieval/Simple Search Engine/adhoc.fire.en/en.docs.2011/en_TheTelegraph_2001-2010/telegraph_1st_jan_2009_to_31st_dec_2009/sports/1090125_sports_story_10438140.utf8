The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev jumps to tied 31st
                                                   Jeev jumps to tied 31st
                      
	Doha: Jeev Milkha Singh brought home his second sub-par card of the week, a two-under 70, to jump to the tied 31st spot after the penultimate round but compatriot Jyoti Randhawa slid to tied 36th following his rollercoaster even-par round in the Qatar Masters here Saturday.         
	Jeev birdied the second hole but bogeys on the fifth and ninth had him at one-over at the turn.         
	Jeev made amends with a birdie-birdie start to his back nine and picked up one more shot on the 16th, keeping this stretch bogey-free all along to aggregate four-under 212 and join four others at the 31st place. In contrast, Randhawa (213) showed tremendous resilience to eventually finish with a level-par card even though it could easily have been worse.         
	The first hole bogey didnt give him any inkling of the troubles ahead and Randhawa bogeyed the third and sixth holes before dropping a couple on the par-five ninth to take the turn at three-over.         
	He showed marked improvement on his back nine, blasting four birdies to go one-under before the final hole bogey denied him a positive signing-off. At the top, Alvaro Quiros (200) blasted 64 to push overnight leader Louis Oosthuizen (69) of South Africa who now trails the Spaniard by just one shot.         
	Quiros, 26, sank eight birdies to move to 16-under for the tournament, one ahead of South African Louis Oosthuizen and four clear of Dutchman Maarten Lafeber and Swedens Henrik Stenson who share third place.         
	With a little bit of luck Ill be fighting for the trophy. But this is golf and you have to wait until its your week, said Quiros, winner of two European Tour titles.           (PTI)

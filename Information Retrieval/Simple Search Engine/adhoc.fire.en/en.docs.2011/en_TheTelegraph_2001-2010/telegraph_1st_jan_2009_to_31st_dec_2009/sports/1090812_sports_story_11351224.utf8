The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sainas journey begins today
                                                   Sainas journey begins today
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hyderabad: The Gachibowli Stadium will be waiting with bated breath on Wednesday when a 19-year-old Indian shuttler, who responds to the name of Saina Nehwal takes the court.         
	Saina, who recently won the Indonesian Open  a Super Series tournament in the Badminton World Federation calendar  will take on Russian Anastasia Prokopenko in the second round of the World Badminton Championships.         
	After a mild bout of chicken pox, which had put a question mark over her participation in the meet, Saina is all set to have a go at her Russian rival.         
	Having started practice a week back, the only nagging fear is whether the world No.6 will be able to cope with the physical strain.         
	Although the India No.1 has claimed she is fully fit, it all depends on how she moves on the court.         
	The draw has been kind to the Hyderabadi though.         
	A bye in the first round allowed her rest on the first two days of the meet. But then, even Anastasia received a walkover in the first round.         
	Wednesday will also see the new combination of Aparna Balan and Shruti Kurian taking on the second-seeded Chinese duo of Shu Cheng and Yunlei Zhao.         
	Chetan Anand, too will be seen in action. The 15th seed will take on Stilian Makarski of Bulgaria.         
	In the mens doubles, Indias Akshay Dewalkar and Jishnu Sanyal will meet Russian 16th seeds Vitalij Durkin and Alexandr Nikolaenko.

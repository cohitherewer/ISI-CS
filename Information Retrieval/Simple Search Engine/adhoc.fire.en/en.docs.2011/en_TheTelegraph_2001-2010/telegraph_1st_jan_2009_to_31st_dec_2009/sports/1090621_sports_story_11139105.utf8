The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kumar: Surprised they played so little for KKR
                                                     Kumar: Surprised they played so little for KKR
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Kumar Sangakkara                           
	London: While spinner Ajantha Mendis has been the joint highest wicket-taker (12) in the ongoing World T20, all-rounder Angelo Mathews ended the West Indies hopes in the very first over of the semi-final.         
	Both have, of course, played in all six of Sri Lankas matches. In the recent IPL, though, Mendis and Mathews were underutilised by the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	Mendis made four appearances and Mathews just one. So much for the John Buchanan-Brendon McCullum partnership which tried to make a difference.         
	Oh, they were definitely not utilised properly... I was quite surprised at the limited number of matches they got, Sri Lankas captain, Kumar Sangakkara, told The Telegraph.         
	Have they, then, proved a point in this tournament?         
	They didnt set out to prove anything... Both are such good cricketers, with Mendis being one of the great spinners, Sangakkara replied.         
	He added: Theyve done enough to get the best deal in the IPLs next edition...         
	Buchanan, by the way, is out of the franchise and McCullum isnt assured of keeping the captaincy.

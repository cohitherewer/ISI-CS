                                                     Dhoni urges players not to hide their injuries
  - Tour of west indies sarwan says depleted indians can still be a handful         A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            MS Dhoni                                 
	Calcutta/Kingston: Mahendra Singh Dhoni has urged his teammates not to hide any injuries or niggles ahead of the four-match ODI series against the West Indies. Dhoni felt it was important for everybody to be truthful about injuries, saying that, if needed, a player should take rest.         
	The Team India captain also said that if anyone wants to take a break from the game, he should either inform him or the Board.         
	The Telegraph had reported on June 18 that Dhoni said the players shouldnt hide their injuries. Players will have to take breaks to be at peak fitness A months break could allow them to play for an extra two-three months.         
	Interestingly, this came after the Virender Sehwag injury fiasco. The opener was included in the World T20 squad despite the Board being aware of an injury that he was carrying from the IPL. Sehwag, Suresh Raina and Zaheer Khan are all missing the West Indies series due to injuries.         
	The Indian team may wear a distinctly depleted look in the absence of Sachin Tendulkar, Sehwag and Zaheer but Chris Gayle said he would not make the mistake of underestimating the visitors in the forthcoming four-match ODI series, starting Friday.         
	After arriving here from England the West Indies captain said India might be without some star players but that the hosts would do well not to take them lightly.         
	It is never a walk over against India. There are a lot of guys still there to give us a lot of trouble, so we just have to stick to the game plan and make it a successful one, Gayle said.         
	The hosts themselves have seen quite a few changes in their squad with pace spearhead Fidel Edwards missing the tournament with a back injury.         
	The West Indies selectors added Darren Bravo, younger brother of Dwayne, in the 13-member squad in which Runako Morton and Narsingh Deonarine replaced Lendl Simmons and Kieron Pollard.                 Chris Gayle   
	Senior batsman Sarwan too agreed that, notwithstanding the depleted squad, India can prove a difficult challenge for the hosts in the series.         
	The Indians are a very good one-day team and while they may be without a couple of their players, they will prove a handful for us, Sarwan said.         
	But we are in good form and have confidence in our abilities and hopefully, beginning Friday, we can get a good start to the series, added Sarwan.         
	About his form, Sarwan said: I dont think I have too much of a problem with my form, its just unfortunate in the 20/20 game you dont have too many overs. But apart from that, I am pretty confident and I am hitting the ball well.         
	Gayle was proud of the West Indies performance in the World Twenty20.         
	It was a pretty decent performance. We tried our best but in the end it was not to be. But I am not disheartened. In fact, I am proud of the guys, as at the championship, not many were expecting us to reach that far, said Gayle.         
	The aim was to bring home the trophy and make everyone happy, especially the fans,added the skipper.

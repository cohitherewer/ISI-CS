The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chinese dragons take lions share 
                                                   Chinese dragons take lions share 
            SHARMISTHA CHAUDHURI                            
	Hyderabad: Lin Dan showed why he is nicknamed Super Dan. The 25-year-old Chinese, who has won almost every title the sport has to offer, pocketed his third World Badminton Championship title on the trot when he beat compatriot and second seed Jin Chen 21-18, 21-16 at the Gachibowli stadium here Sunday.         
	It was, however, not an eventful outing for Dans girlfriend Xie Xingfang, who was also aiming for her third world title. She lost to compatriot Lu Lan 21-23, 12-21 in the womens singles final.         
	The major upset of the day came in the mixed doubles final where Danish seventh seeds, Thomas Laybourn and Kamilla Rytter Juhl ousted the reigning world champions and Indonesian second seeds Nova Widianto and Liliyana Natsir 21-13, 21-17.         
	Super Dan, seeded fifth because he plays only in a selected few tournaments, seemed to be cruising to victory from the word go. The Beijing gold medallist and All-England champion seemed to be playing effortlessly. Jin, who defeated Indonesian Taufik Hidayat in Saturdays semi-final, seemed unusually quiet. He didnt attempt to counter attack and, despite saving four game points in the first game, succumbed to Dans stroke play and drop shots.         
	Jin did show occasional sparks of brilliance with smashes and drop shots, but it just wasnt good enough.         
	Although the last point was controversial  Jins serve was called out  it proved beyond a shadow of doubt that Dan indeed is a genius.         
	Im not a genius. I just work hard, a modest Dan said after the match. It has been a good experience in India. On the question of whether hell go to London in 2012 to defend is title; he said the Games were too far away. For the Danes, it was a good run to the finals. After defeating the Korean top seeds in the last four, they seemed determined to take their first title. After numerous rallies, a smash from Thomas gave them what they wanted.         
	In the womens singles final, Xie, the Chinese veteran and the Beijing Games silver medallist made too many unforced errors against Lu. Lus tricky net play seemed to have pushed Xie on to the back foot as the maiden Championship winner easily outmanoeuvred her opponent.         
	The Chinese team of Yawen Zhang and Tingting Zhao beat compatriots Shu Cheng and Yunlei Zhao to win the womens doubles.         
	The mens doubles was a close affair. After a very long struggle, the fifth seed Chinese duo of Yun Kai and Haifeng Fu outlasted Korean opponents, Jae Sung Jung and Yong Dae Lee, 21-18, 16-21, 28-26 in a contest that lasted an hour and 16 minutes.         
	Meanwhile, the BWF announced next years India Open dates. The tournament will be held in Hyderabad, from June 7-13.         
	Sundays results (all finals):         
	Mens singles: Lin Dan (Chn) bt Jin Chen (Chn) 21-18, 21-16 Womens singles: Lu Lan (Chn) bt Xie Xingfang (Chn) 23-21, 21-12 Womens doubles: Yawen Zhang/Tingting Zhao (Chn) bt Shu Cheng/Yunlei Zhao (Chn) 17-21, 21-17, 21-16 Mens doubles: Yun Kai/Haifeng Fu (Chn) bt Jae Sung Jung/Yong Dae Lee (Kor) 21-18, 16-21, 28-26 Mixed doubles: Thomas Laybourn/Kamilla Rytter Juhl (Den) bt Nova Widianto/Liliyana Natsir 21-13, 21-17

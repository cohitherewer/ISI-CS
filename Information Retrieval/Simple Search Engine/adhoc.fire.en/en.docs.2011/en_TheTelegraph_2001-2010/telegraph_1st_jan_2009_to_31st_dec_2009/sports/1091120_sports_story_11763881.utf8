  - 1st test India coach says team have batsmen to get job done       OUR CORRESPONDENT            Prasanna on Thursday                                 
	Ahmedabad: Gary Kirsten is not reading too much into Virender Sehwag throwing his wicket at Motera on Thursday. Thats the way he bats, the Team India coach said at a news conference.                 
	The following are excerpts         
	Indian batting on Thursday         
	191 for one would have been better. It is a good batting effort. Im pleased with what the guys did there. Hopefully we can see it through         
	The chances of saving the Test         
	Weve got the batsmen; weve got the skill in our team to do what we need to. But it requires a lot of concentration and effort.         
	Gautam Gambhirs presence         
	We know what he is capable of and he has proven that. Dont forget Gautam and Rahul (Dravid) saved us the Test in Napier earlier this year.         
	The plan on the final day         
	It will be playing according to the situation and the bottom line is that we need to bat for 80 per cent of the day.         
	The target         
	I think the quicker we get to 334, the better. Sehwags dismissal         
	We know the way he generally bats. We graciously accept the benefits when he makes a big contribution. At the same time there is always a risk attached to the way he plays cricket. Thats the way it is...         
	Around 1400 runs and only 19 wickets in the four days of this Test         
	 We know that this wicket has favoured the batsmen, and so they are cashing in. We dont often play on this sort of wicket.         
	Tackling Murali on the final day         
	Murali is always a threat, hes a world class bowler and a threat to any team. Its up to us to be able to make sure we prevent him from doing any major damage.

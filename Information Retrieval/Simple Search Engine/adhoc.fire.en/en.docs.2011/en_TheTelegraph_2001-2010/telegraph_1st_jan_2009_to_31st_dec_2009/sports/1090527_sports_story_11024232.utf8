The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Relaxed Maria to take it as it comes
                                                   Relaxed Maria to take it as it comes
            CHRISTOPHER CLAREY                         
	Paris: Once again, you could see her as she galloped along the baseline and coquettishly tucked those stray strands of hair behind each ear before a serve.         
	Once again, you could hear her as she shrieked  not nearly so demurely  through her groundstrokes.         
	What remains much more unclear is what Maria Sharapovas return to Grand Slam tennis means for the unstable state of the womens game she still ruled one year ago.         
	On Monday, Sharapova, ranked 102 in the world, advanced to the second round of the French Open with a 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 victory over Anastasiya Yakimova of Belarus.         
	In other years, with clay her weakest surface, that result would have generated only mild interest across the crowded grounds of Roland Garros. But it had been nearly a year since Sharapova had played a match in one of the four major tournaments that helped (but only helped) her make her name and her millions.         
	 I dont really have expectations to be honest, she said. I think this is the first time in my career I can really say I dont have any expectations, dont know how things are going to work out, dont know whats going to happen next, how my shoulder is going to feel.         
	Her last appearance in a Grand Slam was at Wimbledon last June when she lost to Alla Kudryavtseva, in the second round. The pain in Sharapovas right shoulder was a recurring problem by then, and she would only play one more tournament, withdrawing before the third round in Montreal.         
	After missing the Olympics and the U.S. Open, she decided to undergo an operation in New York on October 15 to repair her rotator cuff. The procedure took just 22 minutes but it would take Sharapova nearly seven months more to return to singles in Warsaw last week.         
	Warsaw was merely the rehearsal for the big stage of the French Open, and on Monday, she walked onto the red clay of Court One.         
	Once No. 1 in the rankings and long No. 1 in off-court earnings, she was technically an underdog.         
	But Sharapova, who has won the three other Grand Slam titles, clearly is eager to start playing plenty of matches. You could see it in her attitude on Monday.         
	In general, her baseline and return game looked solid and suffocating. The technical question mark remains her serve, which is still consistently slower than in earlier phases of her career.         
	She will now face the 11th seeded Russian, Nadia Petrova, in the second round.         
	But Sharapova is at least back in the arena, where her street fighter mentality comes in handy.         
	 I think if I was a mentally weak person or individual, I think I wouldnt be here, she said.           NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

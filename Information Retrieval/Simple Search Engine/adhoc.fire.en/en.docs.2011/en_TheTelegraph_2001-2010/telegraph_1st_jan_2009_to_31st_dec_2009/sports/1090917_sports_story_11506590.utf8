The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hirwani, Bhave on duty again 
                                                   Hirwani, Bhave on duty again 
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: Generally, the selectors retain a winning combination.         
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), too, has done just that in deciding on who from among the five would do duty during the September 22-October 5 Champions Trophy.         
	And, so, Narendra Hirwani and Surendra Bhave, whod been in New Zealand this year, have been selected for the trip to South Africa.         
	Team Indias first match in the Champions Trophy, against Pakistan, is on September 26 and they should be there at least a day earlier.         
	It was in Hirwani and Bhaves presence that Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. won the Test series 1-0, the first such success in New Zealand after four decades.         
	You could say that a winning combination has been retained, off the field Its the on-field performance that were now looking forward to, a source in the BCCI told The Telegraph.         
	Chief selector Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Raja Venkat had gone for the World T20, in England, but holders Team India didnt make even the semi-finals.         
	That combination, it seems, will have to wait for the tour of Bangladesh, early next year.         
	Yashpal Sharma, who completes the quintet, has made back-to-back trips: To the West Indies, for the four-match ODI series in June-July, and to Sri Lanka, for the tri-series which concluded on Monday.         
	Both were rather short tours, but its not known whether lone ranger Yashpal (a member of the 1983 World Cup-winning XI) has been grumbling.         
	Team India, of course, won both in the West Indies and in Sri Lanka and will start the Champions Trophy ranked among the top-three. As of now, theres little separating South Africa, Australia and Dhonis men.         
	After yet another win over England, this time at Trent Bridge on Tuesday, Australia have displaced Team India from the No.2 position. Both, though, are on the same (ICC) rating points  126, one behind South Africa.         
	Dhoni and Co. leave on Friday morning, via Dubai.

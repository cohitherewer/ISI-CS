	New Delhi: It was a mixed day for the Indians at the ATP Vancouver Open. While Prakash Amritraj crashed out of the $175,000 event losing in straight sets 4-6, 1-6 to Marcos Baghdatis, top seed Sania Mirza overcame tough resistance from American qualifier Mallory Cecil to win 6-4, 7-5 in a first round match.         
	Baghdatis, on the comeback trail, raced to a 3-1 lead in the first set and coasted through the rest of it, finally wrapping it up 6-4.         
	He then broke Prakash in the Indians opening service game of the second set, to pull 2-0 ahead.

	Sania, who defeated 410-ranked Mallory will next face Laura Granville of the US, who got a walk over after her Japanese opponent Aiko Nakamura opted out in the third set.         
	Nakamura was leading 4-3 in the decisive set when she opted out of the contest. Granville had lost the first set 2-6 but stretched the match to third set after winning the second 6-3.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tendulkar: Batsmen let us down 
                                                   Tendulkar: Batsmen let us down 
            OUR BUREAU                      
	Sachin Tendulkar, captain of the Mumbai Indians, held his batsmen responsible for the seven-wicket loss against the Chennai Super Kings in their Indian Premier League match on Saturday. He also criticised their failure to handle crunch situations. The loss almost ended the Mumbai sides hope of making it to the semi-finals.         
	We tried every combination. We fell short by a couple of runs. We couldnt put enough runs on board, admitted Tendulkar at the post-match ceremony.         
	The batting maestro felt that the 26 extra runs conceded also affected their cause.         
	We gave away a lot of extras Couple of byes and leg-byes in crunch situations, he said.         
	His Super Kings counterpart Mahendra Singh Dhoni wasnt too satisfied despite the victory.         
	We are committing the same mistakes during fielding. We are committing them in each and every game. If we dont get it right in the knock-out stage, we would be in trouble, Dhoni warned.         
	While Matthew Hayden has been going strong, the Chennai side have struggled to find him a partner at the top of the order.         
	But Dhoni was ready to give Parthiv Patel some more chances to prove his credentials.         
	I think Parthiv can do it. Last year he did a good job for us. We will give him some more matches and hopefully he will get back to form, said Dhoni.         
	Hayden too echoed similar sentiments.         
	Parthiv has been a bit unlucky today (Saturday). But he is a good striker of the ball. Hope to see him continue, said Hayden when asked about Parthiv.

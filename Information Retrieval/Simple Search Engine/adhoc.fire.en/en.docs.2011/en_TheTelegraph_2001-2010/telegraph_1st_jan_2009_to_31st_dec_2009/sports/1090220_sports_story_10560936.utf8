The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Milan held 1-1 by Bremen
                                                   Milan held 1-1 by Bremen
                      
	London: A late equaliser from Werder Bremens Brazilian international Diego denied AC Milan victory in their Uefa Cup first knockout round first leg tie in Germany on Wednesday.         
	Midfielder Diego rewarded a strong second-half display from the Bundesliga side six minutes from time by controlling Hugo Almeidas header with his chest before firing past Dida to secure a 1-1 draw.         
	Filippo Inzaghi had put competition favourites Milan ahead on 36 minutes, the striker firing in a rebound after his own header from Mathieu Flaminis cross had been blocked.         
	On-loan midfielder David Beckham came off the bench for the final two minutes after being added to Milans Uefa Cup squad despite uncertainties over his future with the Serie A side. Beckham, on a two-month loan from Los Angeles Galaxy, has said he wants to stay in Italy.         
	Holders Zenit St Petersburg began life without influential playmaker Andrei Arshavin by defeating VfB Stuttgart 2-1. Ukraine international Anatoliy Tymoschuk blasted the Russian side 2-1 ahead in first-half stoppage time with a fierce shot after latching on to Dannys pass.         
	The competitions leading scorer Vagner Love took his tally to nine this season with a first-half goal in CSKA Moscows 1-1 draw in Birmingham with Aston Villa.         
	Valencia, the 2004 winners, drew 1-1 in Ukraine against Dynamo Kiev, Paris St Germain striker Guillaume Hoarau scored twice in the final 10 minutes in a 2-0 home victory over VfL Wolfsburg and Hamburg SV all but booked their last 16 place after easing to a 3-0 win away to NEC Nijmegen.         
	The remaining five last 32 first leg ties take place on Thursday. (REUTERS)

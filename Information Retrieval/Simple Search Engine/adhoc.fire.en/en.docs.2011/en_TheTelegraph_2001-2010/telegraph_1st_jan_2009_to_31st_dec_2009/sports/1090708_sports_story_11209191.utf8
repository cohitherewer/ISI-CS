The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pele wants salary cap 
                                                     Pele wants salary cap 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Pele                           
	Abuja (Nigeria): Pele has urged Fifa to introduce a salary cap for players and warned that the vast sums of money changing hands in the game could taint its image for future generations.         
	Pele, in Nigeria to promote Rio de Janeiros bid to host the 2016 Olympic Games, said he was concerned about how the game had changed with the influx of money from billionaire owners.         
	My time was a little different  we did not have the big sponsors, he said. Today they have big sponsors, big companies to support football. But in my point of view and the point of view of Fifa, these (players salaries) must be controlled.         
	Fifa president Sepp Blatter has spoken out about the huge sums of money in the game, echoing concerns from Europes ruling body Uefa and other sports officials.         
	However, Blatter also welcomed Cristiano Ronaldos 80 million move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, saying it demonstrated the games enduring popularity  the Spanish side have recently splashed out almost 200 million to bring in Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, Kaka and Raul Albiol.         
	Pele warned that soccers image could be tainted for future generations if huge amounts of money continued to change hands in the sport.         
	You get a player today that they announce in Manchester United, Real Madrid or Milan or any other team, and they kiss their shirt, he added. The next day, he goes to another team and he kisses that shirt. This, I think, is something we have to pay attention to for the next generation.         
	Pele, along with other members of Rio de Janeiros delegation, are expected to make their pitch to International Olympic Committee (IOC) members in Nigerias capital Abuja later on Tuesday.         
	Fellow candidates for the 2016 Games  Chicago, Tokyo and Madrid  will also make their case for hosting the event to IOC members. A winner will be chosen on October 2 in Copenhagen.         
	You have had a lot of Olympics in the United States, in Europe, but in South America we dont have, Pele said. Everybody knows Brazil is prepared for (the Olympics). Not only Brazil, but the whole of South America.         
	Brazil will also host the football World Cup in 2014.

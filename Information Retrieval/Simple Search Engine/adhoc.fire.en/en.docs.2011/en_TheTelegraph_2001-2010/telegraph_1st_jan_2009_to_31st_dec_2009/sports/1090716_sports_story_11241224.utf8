The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | MCC: IPL a threat to Tests
                                                   MCC: IPL a threat to Tests
                      
	London: Test cricket is on the verge of dying a sad death in most countries with more and more players considering an Indian Premier League (IPL) contract their ultimate goal, according to the MCC World Cricket Committee.         
	Future of the games longest version dominated the two-day meeting of the panel at Lords that concluded Tuesday with the committee recommending a World Test Championship, trial of day/night Test cricket and pink balls to revive the formats fortunes.         
	Except for certain icon series, such as the Ashes, Test cricket throughout the world, and in particular the lower-ranked nations, is in very real danger of dying, the committee said in a statement.         
	Underlining the IPLs impact on the longest version of the game, the committee said: MCCs research proved that attendance at Test cricket has declined in recent years. In addition, there is a growing ambivalence towards the longest format among cricketers in certain nations, with player surveys revealing that an IPL contract was the main career aspiration for many.         
	The committee is deeply concerned that the proliferation of lucrative domestic Twenty20 leagues, such as the IPL, will lead to the premature retirement of quality international cricketers.         
	Those from the lower-ranked Test nations could be particularly susceptible to such a career choice, based on earnings alone, it added.         
	In such a situation, a World Test Championship would reignite interest among players, spectators and broadcasters for what is the pinnacle of the game, the committee said.         
	There are already World Championships in twenty and fifty-over cricket. World cricket needs a World Test Championship and it needs one within the short-term. Work should commence immediately on devising the appropriate format, it noted.         
	The panel also felt that administrators have failed to market Test cricket. The committee endorsed day-night Tests and said a trial should take place within the next 12 months.         
	After hearing endorsements from panel members Shaun Pollock and Steve Waugh, the committee was unanimous in its support of the pink ball, which would enable Test cricket to continue to be played in white clothing.         
	The panel, which includes former India captain Anil Kumble and Rahul Dravid, voiced its concern about overkill and asked the national boards to carefully control the release of their contracted players to domestic Twenty20 leagues like the IPL.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Serena still awaiting test at US Open
                                                     Serena still awaiting test at US Open
                  Serena at Flushing Meadows on Sunday                     
	New York: Serena Williams is still waiting for her first test of this US Open.         
	The defending champions fourth-round match was competitive for all of four games Sunday, before Serena took 10 in a row to beat No. 22-seeded Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia 6-2, 6-0.         
	Serena has reached the quarter finals at 11 of the past 12 major tournaments and won the title at three of the past four.         
	With the score 2-all against Hantuchova, Serena hit three aces to hold for a 3-2 lead  and she wouldnt lose a game the rest of the way.         
	She has won all eight sets shes played this year at Flushing Meadows. I tried to relax, Williams said after improving to 8-1 against Hantuchova over their careers. Sometimes Im such a perfectionist, I too much stress on myself. I was like, Serena, relax!         
	She finished with eight aces and a 27-9 advantage in winners in Sundays first match in Arthur Ashe Stadium.         
	Serena is the highest-ranked woman left in the womens draw. Dinara Safina will remain atop the rankings, though, even if Serena were to win a second consecutive US Open title and fourth overall.         
	In the mens singles third round, Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain, the 24th seed, was up two-sets-to-one, when ninth seeded Frenchman Gilles Simon retired in the fourth set. Ferrero won 1-6, 6-4, 7-6 (5), 1-0.         
	 Earlier on Saturday, American sensations John Isner and Melanie Oudin sent former champions Andy Roddick and Maria Sharapova spinning out of the US Open.         
	Isner and Oudin sparked off celebrations in their hometown of Georgia after showing off their bulldog spirit to full effect.         
	Big-serving Roddick came face-to-face with a 2.06 meter tall (6foot9) player he had mentored up the ranks and as a way of thanks Isner boomed in 38 aces to trample the fifth seed 7-6, 6-3, 3-6, 5-7, 7-6.         
	While 55th ranked Isner was delighted to pull off the biggest shock of the mens draw, Oudin followed up her win over world No. 4 Elena Dementieva by thumping another Russian.         
	The 17-year-old Oudin had the honour of ringing the opening bell at the Nasdaq exchange earlier this week and her stock rose even higher on Saturday as she carved out a heart-pounding 3-6, 6-4, 7-5 win over 29th seed Sharapova.         
	Oudin simply looked dazed as she dropped her racket before raising her weary arms to acknowledge the cheers.         
	I just kept fighting as hard as I could. I cant believe it, the 70th ranked Oudin gasped in a courtside interview as she tried to blink back tears.         
	I just had a blast playing there, added Oudin, who will aim to bump another Russian, Nadia Petrova, in the last 16.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Watson shines in Aussie victory

	Mohali: India slumped to a 24-run defeat in the fourth one-dayer that not only allowed Australia to level the seven-match series 2-2, but also prolonged the hosts wait to regain the No. 1 ODI spot in the world, here Monday.         
	Chasing 251, India got off to a flier with Virender Sehwag (30 off 19 balls) looking eager to wrap up the issue and Sachin Tendulkar (40) going great guns.         
	But after their fall, the middle and lower order could not forge a single significant partnership and the team folded up for 226 in 46.4 overs.         
	Earlier, put in to bat, Australia stitched together half-centuries from Ponting (52) and White (62) and cameos from Shane Watson (49) and Michael Hussey (40) to reach 250 before wilting in 49.2 overs.         
	Indias chase got off to a blazing start with Sehwag displaying the kind of power-hitting on which he has built his career around. The first ball raced to the fence off his blade faster than it had arrived and it was a bad omen for Mitchell Johnson.         
	The hapless birthday boy copped three boundaries in his next over and an encore of the treatment meant the Australian spearhead had haemorrhaged 34 runs in his first three overs before Ponting spared further trauma by withdrawing him from attack.         
	It was too good to last for long and relief for Australia came soon when Sehwag fell to Doug Bollinger in the seventh over and Virat Kohli (10), replacing Gautam Gambhir, squandered yet another opportunity to impress, leaving India at 78 for two.         
	With Sachin Tendulkar in pursuit of yet another batting milestone  47 runs separated him from the 17,000 mark when he walked out  and looking in good nick, the crowd had enough to look forward to till an Ashoka de Silva howler spoiled their party.         
	Fluent initially and aware of the imminent milestone as he approached it, Tendulkar was hit on the pad by an innocuous Nathan Hauritz delivery that was missing the leg stump but de Silva raised his dreaded finger to send groans across the chock-a-block stadium.         
	At 94 for three, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (26) and Yuvraj Singh (12) had a task uncannily similar to the one they had accomplished in the previous match in Delhi but this time their association was nipped in the bud by a Ricky Ponting direct throw that sent back Yuvraj.         
	Dhoni then became Bollingers third victim, Hauritz castled Suresh Raina (17) and Ravindra Jadeja (7) ran himself out, leaving India gasping at 177 for seven in the 39th over. Down the order Harbhajan Singhs 25-ball 35  like the series opener in Vadodara  was entertaining but not clinching.         
	Earlier, fluent half-centuries from Ricky Ponting (52) and Cameron White (62) and brisk cameos from Shane Watson (49) and Michael Hussey (40) laid the perfect foundation for an imposing total before Australia ran out of steam and wilted in the end.         
	Going strong at 196 for three, Australia came unstuck in the 39th over, fumbling in the batting power play, which cost them four wickets earning just 27 runs, before eventually folding for a total that was far less than they would have anticipated.         
	Ashish Nehra (3/37) was pick of the Indian bowlers.

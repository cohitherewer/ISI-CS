The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brett Lee out of third Test too
                                                   Brett Lee out of third Test too
                      
	London: Fearing a rushed comeback might lead to yet another breakdown, Australias injury-ravaged pacer Brett Lee has ruled himself out of the third Ashes Test in Edgbaston and is instead eyeing a return in the next match at Leeds.         
	Recuperating from a small abdominal tear, the 32-year-old has already been left out of the Australian squad for a three-day practice match against Northamptonshire.         
	Id be lying if I said I was available for the third Test because its going to be very, very tight. I dont want to put the team in jeopardy because there is a chance something might happen, Lee said.         
	Its not a great outcome if Im out there bowling and I tear it again. It would leave the team short and wreck my chances of finishing the Ashes tour, he was quoted as saying by an Australian daily.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Eight-over Jeev misses the cut 
                                                   Eight-over Jeev misses the cut 
                      
	Charlotte (US): Jeev Milkha Singh missed the cut at the Quail Hollow Championship after stumbling to a second successive four-over 76. The seasoned Indian pro signed off with a total of eight-over 152, way below the cut that came at even-par 144.         
	After the opening round disaster, Jeev needed a miracle to be in contention for the weekend action but that didnt happen as the Indian opened with back-to-back bogeys on Friday. Jeevs woes were further compounded by a double bogey on the seventh hole, leaving him four-over at the turn.         
	Meanwhile, Tiger Woods bogeyed two of the last three holes to concede the lead to Bubba Watson and Retief Goosen. Watson overpowered Quail Hollow, tying a course record with a 30 on the front nine, and shooting 7-under 65.         
	Goosen had another 68 to join Watson atop the leaderboard with an 8-under 136.         
	Gaganjeet best         
	In Jaipur, Gaganjeet Bhullar won his second professional title after edging past Himmat Singh Rai in playoff at the PGTI Players Championship Saturday. (Agencies)

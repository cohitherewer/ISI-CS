The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clarke all for player rotation
                                                   Clarke all for player rotation
                      
	Melbourne: Australia vice-captain Michael Clarke on Sunday advocated players rotation system, which he feels, have become a necessity rather than an option.         
	Sometimes its not just about reputation, its about a fresh mind. Rather than having a tired Ricky Ponting or Mike Hussey or myself, its better to have someone like Marcus North come in, Clarke said.         
	I think the selectors, Cricket Australia (CA), the coach and the players are all communicating well and thats why were still doing well when guys are resting, he added.         
	The 28-year-old New South Wales cricketer said with the cricket calendar getting busier every day, players needed cooling time.         
	I think were all becoming much more aware of the impact too much playing and touring can have on players, he said. (PTI)

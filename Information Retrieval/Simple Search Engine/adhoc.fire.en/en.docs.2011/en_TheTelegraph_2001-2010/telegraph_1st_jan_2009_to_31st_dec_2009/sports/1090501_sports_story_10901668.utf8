The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sehwag amp; Co. halt Chargers juggernaut
                                                     Sehwag amp; Co. halt Chargers juggernaut
                  Tillekaratne Dilshan in Pretoria on Thursday                     
	Pretoria: The Deccan Chargers winning streak came to an end Thursday as the Delhi Daredevils cantered to a comfortable six-wicket victory over them in the Indian Premier League (IPL) here.         
	Put into bat, the Chargers recovered from a disastrous start to score 148 for nine riding on Dwayne Smiths fighting 28-ball 48, but the total was not enough as the DareDevils romped home with eight balls to spare at the SuperSport Park.         
	Dinesh Karthik (35 off 40) and Tillekaratne Dilshan, who remained unbeaten on 52 off 46 balls, added 79 runs for the fourth wicket. With 17 runs required off 12 balls, Dilshan cracked two boundaries off West Indian Fidel Edwards in the 18th over and wrapped up the game with a six.         
	The Delhi side started on an attacking note as Gautam Gambhir clobbered the third delivery of the innings off Edwards to the fence.         
	It was followed by Virender Sehwags two consecutive fours off RP Singh in the next over. But the Delhi openers again failed to give their side a solid start as both departed cheaply.         
	Sehwag, who smashed four boundaries during his 11-ball stay, was the first to return to the pavilion after falling prey to Chargers pacer RP in fourth over, before Shoaib Ahmed dismissed South African AB de Villiers in the next over.         
	Things got further complicated for the DareDevils when Gambhir, who was middling every ball, also had to return after Ahmeds wicket-bound delivery found his leg.         
	However, Karthik and Dilshan put up a creditable show to pull their team out of the slump, before Karthik was out lbw off Pragyan Ojha.         
	Earlier, the Chargers got off to a disastrous start with their two in-form batsmen Adam Gilchrist and Herchelle Gibbs perishing quickly, but Dwayne Smiths 28-ball 48 helped the team to put up a competitive total.

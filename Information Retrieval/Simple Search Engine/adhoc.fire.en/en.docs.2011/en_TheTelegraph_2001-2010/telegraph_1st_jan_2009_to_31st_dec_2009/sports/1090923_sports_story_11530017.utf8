	New Delhi: Okolie Odafe once again proved to be Mohun Bagans nemesis as he struck a brilliant hattrick in the extra time to guide Churchill Brothers to a memorable 3-1 Durand Cup triumph at the Ambedkar Stadium, here on Tuesday.         
	Trailing by a 94th minute goal, the wily Nigerian struck three goals in a span of 19 minutes to destroy Mohun Bagans hopes of taking the trophy back to Calcutta after nine years.         
	For the 8,000 odd spectators, Odafe was like a magician on the pitch, who simply toyed with the much acclaimed Mohun Bagan defence and scored whenever he wanted to. He did not find the target in the regulation period, but once Mohun Bagan took the lead through Edeh Chidi, the Churchill striker roared into action to leave the green and maroon brigade shattered.         
	Odafe amply justified why the Churchill bosses had reportedly paid more than Rs 1 crore to him for the season. He was instrumental in the Goa teams victory in the IFA Shield and on Tuesday, he single-handedly bagged the Durand Cup for Churchill after 2007. Incidentally his hattrick came against a defence, which was made up of four national campers.         
	Odafe was unstoppable after Chidi headed in a free kick by Subhojit Majumdar. In the 99th minute, he grabbed a faulty clearance and then got past two defenders to slam the ball into the corner of the net.         
	Next, he nodded home from a goalmouth melee in the 104th minute after goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee managed to palm away a shot by Charan Rai.         
	As if to ensure that the Durand Cup final was his personal show, the Nigerian broke through alone in the 118th minute to beat the goalkeeper. Everyone around, including his rivals, remained awestruck by Odafes performance.         
	Going by the trend of the match, Mohun Bagan were lucky that Churchill didnt walk away with their second Durand Cup win in the regulation period itself. If the Calcutta team managed to put up a semblance of a fight in the first session, they were completely at the receiving end in the second half.         
	Initially, both the teams were clear in their game plans. Keep the foreigners under tight markings and go for quick counter attacks. The ploy was successful in the first half as the strikers of both the teams did not get enough room to manoeuvre.         
	Yet, in the closing minutes of the first half, Odafe displayed his class and quality when he nearly put Churchill in the lead on two occasions. The one that came a minute before the breather was a treat to watch.         
	Placed in a difficult situation on the right, the Nigerian whistled past Mohanraj in a flash and then flicked the ball towards the Mohun Bagan goal. Before a bemused Sangram Mukherjee could react, the ball hit the post and returned to play.         
	Next time, it was Deepak Mondals turn to get baffled by Odafes skills. Running towards the Bagans goal, the Churchill striker stopped for a moment and then accelerated to go past his marker. His shot was well directed but Mukherjee was alert under the bar.         
	Mohun Bagan had another close shave in the 38th minute when Kalus powerful header beat everyone including Mukherjee. The ball was all set to enter the net when Snehasish Chakrabarty managed to clear the ball from the goalline.         
	The green and maroon brigade were completely on the defensive in the second session. Apart from having a torrid time, Mohun Bagan were distinctly lucky not to concede a penalty when Mukherjee came out of his charge to foil an onrushing Kalu, who was well positioned to find the target. It looked Kalu wasnt blocked by the goalkeeper in the right manner but the referee thought otherwise.         
	On the contrary, the Calcutta side could hardly make any positive move except for one free kick by Micky Fernandes that had goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya in all sorts of trouble. Bagans two main weapons  Jose Barreto and Edeh Chidi  were considerably blunted by Churchills tight markings.         
	Still, Chidi looked the most energetic man upfront. Moving from right to left, he was the main force in the Bagan attacks and posed threats whenever he had the ball in the rival area.

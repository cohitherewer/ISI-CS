            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A fourth-minute own-goal by BNRs Sudip Santra ensured full points for Mohammedan Sporting in their fourth CFL Premier Division encounter on Friday.         
	This is Mohammedan Sportings third victory in four matches. They now have 10 points.         
	The railwaymen should consider themselves unlucky not to have snatched a point. They conceded a silly goal even before they could settle down.         
	They came back well in the second half, courtesy Nigerian winger Baba Tunde, but an equaliser eluded them.         
	The start couldnt have been better for Shabbir Alis boys as Theodore Sunday freed Jothi Kumar on the right.         
	The Mohammedan Sporting captain kept a low centre for Lalchuan Awma but to his delight he saw Santra in his bid to clear the ball put it into his own goal.         
	Up by a goal, Mohammedan Sporting were expected to attack more frequently but they failed to make any decisive inroads. Dipendu Biswas who replaced Brazilian Eduardo Escobar (out with a double booking) was a disappointment up front. His strike partner Theo tried his best but didnt quite look match-fit.

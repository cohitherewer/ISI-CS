The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sharapova falls to Dominika
                                                   Sharapova falls to Dominika
                      
	Paris: Maria Sharapova barely averted a shutout Tuesday before losing to Dominika Cibulkova 0-6, 2-6 in the quarter-finals of the French Open, the worst Grand Slam defeat of her career.         
	Cibulkova was one point from victory at 5-love in the second set before Sharapova finally found her form. She won that game and then another, hitting a flurry of winners and saving four match points before Cibulkova closed out the win.         
	I dont really care about numbers, Sharapova said. Its either a W or an L, and I prefer W. You know, if its 7-6 in the third and you come out with a loss, I mean, whats the difference?         
	Sharapova was playing in just her second tournament after a layoff of nearly 10 months because of a right shoulder injury. She won three-setters in all four previous rounds at Paris, and the long matches took a toll.         
	I guess you could only ask your body to do so much, she said.         
	Everything fell a little short today. The pace wasnt there on my strokes, and I was five steps slower.         
	The three-time Grand Slam champion had 27 unforced errors to nine for the No. 20-seeded Cibulkova, a Slovak who advanced to her first major semi-final.         
	Cibulkovas opponent Thursday will be top-ranked Dinara Safina, who rallied to beat Victoria Azarenka 1-6, 6-4, 6-2.         
	Sharapovas legs looked wobbly, and she repeatedly hit the ball late and sent it wide.         
	The 20-year-old Cibulkova relied on steady strokes from the baseline, and the margin in unforced errors in the opening set was 13-1.         
	Sharapova was bidding to reach her second semi-final following a run to the 2007 last four.         
	The Russian star, whose ranking slumped to No.104 in the world during her time off the tour, had won both her previous matches against the pint-sized, 20-year-old Cibulkova and both were on clay.         
	But Cibulkova, 11 inches (27cm) shorter than the glamorous Russian, was in complete control of the quarter final, breaking in the first, third and fifth games of the opening set.         
	It was, I think, more surprising for the people who dont know me, maybe for the crowd, Cibulkova said. But today I was playing really solid.         
	The games were closer early in the second set, but Sharapova looked increasingly desperate to win. Caught out of position, she even tried a left-handed forehand.         
	It went wide too, putting her behind 5-love.         
	When Sharapova finally won a game by smacking a return winner, she reacted with only a subdued fist pump. She then clubbed three winners to hold at love for 5-2, but although she erased three match points in the next game, there would be no miracle comeback.         
	Sharapova pushed a forehand into the net on the final point, and Cibulkova collapsed to the clay in glee and relief. Sharapova took consolation in reaching the quarter finals.         
	Reflecting back on everything that Ive been through in the last year, I think I can sit here and say Im pretty proud of what Ive achieved, she said. Ive just got to keep working and keep my head up, just go on a practice court and hits millions of balls.         
	A slow start couldnt stop top-ranked Dinara Safina from reaching the semi-finals at the French Open.         
	Faced with a tough test for the first time in the tournament, Safina rallied to beat Victoria Azarenka.         
	Safina, seeking her first Grand Slam title, lost only five games in the first four rounds. Against Azarenka, Safina was repeatedly lunging for shots early but regained her dominating form at 4-all in the second set.         
	Safina, the sister of two-time Grand Slam champion Marat Safin, was the runner-up at the 2008 French Open and this years Australian Open. She became No.1 for the first time on April 20 and is 19-1 this year on clay.         
	On a cloudless, mild afternoon, the No.9-seed Azarenka played nearly flawless tennis at the outset. She hit 10 winners with one unforced error in the opening set, which took only 23 minutes.         
	But after Safina fell behind 1-love in the second set she dug in, running off four consecutive games. Her groundstrokes became steadier, while mistakes crept into Azarenkas play. The Belarussian double-faulted on consecutive points and made four unforced errors to lose a service game at love.         
	When Azarenka sailed a return long on the final point of the second set, she angrily threw down her racket, caught it on the bounce and threw it again as the crowd hooted.         
	By the final changeover, a frustrated Azarenka sat with a towel draped over her face. Safina swept the last three games and the final five points.         
	She was playing well, and basically I was not doing anything to complicate it, Safina said. I started to fight point by point just trying to change a little bit.         
	She was missing way too much, Safina said.         
	I just missed a lot of my chances, said the 19-year-old Azarenka, who was playing in her first Grand Slam quarter final.         
	Its all experience, which I have to learn from.           (AGENCIES)

                                                   Leander, Rohan advance
                      
	New Delhi: Leander Paes and Rohan Bopanna advanced to the quarter finals of different ATP events after registering first round victories with their respective partners.         
	Paes and his Czech partner Luaks Dlouhy had to toil hard to beat German pair of Christopher Kas and Philipp Kohlschreiber 7-6 (7-4), 5-7, 10-3 in the World tennis tournament in Rotterdam, Holland.         
	The second seeded Indo-Czech pair dropped their serve thrice and could convert just two of nine breakpoints but ultimately relied on their experience to prevail in the super tie-breaker.         
	They next face Russian-Polish pair of Igor Andreev and Marcin Matkowski.         
	At the SAP Open in the US, Bopanna and Finlands Jarko Nieminen beat American pair of Rajeev Ram and Bobby Reynolds 6-2, 6-4 in the first round in 58 minutes.         
	The duo broke their rivals twice in each set and dropped their serve once in the second set. In the quarter finals, Bopanna-Nieminen will meet the winners of the first round match between Bob and Mike Bryan and Thailands Sanchai and Sonchat Ratiwatana.

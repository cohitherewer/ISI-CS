The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Needed this victory, says Sachin
                                                   Needed this victory, says Sachin
                      
	Port Elizabeth: Sachin Tendulkar, the Mumbai Indians captain said his team have taken heart from Sundays victory over the Royal Challengers Bangalore. We needed this victory; I thought Rahane and Duminy batted well till the end. I thought it was a good all round display by the team, our batting, bowling and fielding was good, Tendulkar said.         
	The Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Anil Kumble said his side will have to seriously work on keeping wickets intact in the early overs.         
	We lost too many wickets at the start (of run chase) and probably that was the main reason (for the loss). Thats what we need to look at seriously, Kumble said after the match. (PTI)

                                                   IPL committee advises rehab for Kamran
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Indian Premier League (IPL) technical committee, on Sunday, recommended a two-week rehabilitation for Rajasthan Royals pacer Kamran Khan who has been reported for a suspect bowling action.         
	According to an IPL release, the technical committee, comprising Sunil Gavaskar, Ravi Shastri and Lalit Modi, met in Johannesburg on Sunday to review the left-arm pacers action (as reported in Mondays Late City edition).         
	The committee was also joined by Anurag Thakur and Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi from India, via a conference call, after Rudi Koertzen and Gary Baxter reported Kamran for a suspect bowling action after the Chennai Super Kings and the Rajasthan Royals match at the Centurion on Thursday.         
	After the match was over, footage was obtained and examined by all the three umpires, including TV umpire Amish Saheba, and it was decided that further action was necessary under the Laws of Cricket, section 24/3, that governs the game. The matter was then referred by the IPL to the Rajasthan Royals team management and the technical committee, as per the Laws of Cricket, that govern the game.         
	Kamran, who has yet to play a first-class game, has been hailed by Royals captain Shane Warne as sensational.

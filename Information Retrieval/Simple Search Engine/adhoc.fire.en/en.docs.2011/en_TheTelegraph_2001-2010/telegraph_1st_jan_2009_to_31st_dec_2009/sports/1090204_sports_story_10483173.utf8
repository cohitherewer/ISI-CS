The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Federers tears were for end of an era
                                                     Federers tears were for end of an era
            Jim White            Roger Federer                           
	London: On Saturday I was helping out at our local youth football club, coaching a bunch of under sevens. Following Football Association guidelines, the idea was to encourage the girls and boys to have fun, to enjoy themselves through their embrace of the game. One little chap, though, wasnt having fun at all.         
	A talented, committed young footballer, he had done his best during a four-a-side game of knock-down-as-many-cones-as-you-can, but his team had knocked down fewer than their opponents. To the other players on his team, defeat was just one of those things, a passing trifle; their morning was now heading off elsewhere, towards the PlayStation or Wii.         
	But it clearly mattered to him. He took himself off to a corner of the pitch and burst into tears, refusing to take part in the post-match analysis which consisted of several adults telling the children how well they had all done. I went over to the little boy as he stood, shoulders heaving, head down, and told him not to worry. It was good, I said, that he cared so much. It was good, too, that he wanted to win.         
	I told him the best thing, however, was not to cry when he lost, but to remember the hollow feeling he had at that moment. It would be useful in future. Use defeat to make sure you win next time. Youre six now, I said, but as you get older youll learn that crying isnt really the point for a sportsman. In short, what I was telling him was that hed grow out of it.         
	He didnt seem wholly convinced. And no wonder. Some 24 hours later, a man 20 years his senior was behaving in exactly the same way: reacting to defeat with a spasm of disappointed tears. In front of several million people watching across the globe, poor Roger Federer lost control of his bottom lip at the conclusion of the Australian Open. The man who many regard as the finest player in the history of the game was hurting like a six-year-old.         
	It would be harsh, though, not to forgive Federer his sudden retreat to childhood. What had sparked his tears was the realisation of what the defeat meant. It was, after all, not the first time it had happened.         
	Losing to the Spaniard at Wimbledon he might just have been able to post rationalise as a one-off. After Australia, it looks horribly like a pattern.         
	With Nadal now totally dominant, Federer cannot use defeat this time to make sure he wins the next. He is no longer in control of his own destiny. The tears that doused the Melbourne court on Sunday were symptomatic of one of the most poignant rituals in sport: the rare moment of a hand over of ascendancy, the passing of power. After being on his own at the top for so long, Federer is now once again one of the many looking up. His uniqueness has gone.         
	It happened to Rod Laver, it happened to Bjorn Borg, it happened to Pete Sampras. The fact that Federer knew it would one day happen to him did not lessen the jolt when the moment arrived.         
	Sunday marked the end of his era.         
	It was enough, in short, to make grown men weep.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	Pretoria: South Africa captain Johan Botha produced another fine bowling performance to lead his team to 17-run victory in the second Twenty20 International on Sunday.         
	Although clever bowling by Australia had limited South Africa to 156 for five, Australias batsmen could only manage 139 for eight as the hosts went on to make a clean sweep of the two-match series.           (PTI)

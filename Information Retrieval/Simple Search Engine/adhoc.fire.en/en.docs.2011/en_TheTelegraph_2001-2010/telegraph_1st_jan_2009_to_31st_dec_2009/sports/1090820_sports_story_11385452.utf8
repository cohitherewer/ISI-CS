The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chelsea rally to victory
                                                     Chelsea rally to victory
                  Ballack                     
	London: Chelsea hit back to win 3-1 at Sunderland and promoted Wolves captured a 1-0 victory at Wigan in the English Premier League on Tuesday.         
	Darren Bent fired Sunderland into an 18th-minute lead at the Stadium of Light after a shot from Kenwyne Jones was blocked.         
	Michael Ballack levelled in the 52nd after Branislav Ivanovic had headed on a corner by Frank Lampard. Lampard then fired the visitors ahead from the penalty spot after George McCartneys foul on Didier Drogba, and Deco added the third in the 70th from the edge of the area from Jose Bosingwas pass.         
	Wolves victory at Wigan was a major surprise after the home sides 2-0 victory at Aston Villa on Saturday.         
	Andy Keogh headed the only goal after six minutes and Wolves went on to record their first away goal in Premier League football after failing to win on the road the last time it was promoted in 2003.         
	I think that what I have learned and the players have learned is that we can play at this level, said Wolves manager Mick McCarthy, who guided the team to the top of the League Championship last season.

	New Delhi: Former Team India coach Greg Chappell reacted angrily to Virender Sehwags recent comments and said he has decided to cut all ties with Indian cricket.         
	Sehwag commented that Chappell had betrayed the trust of the players by leaking information to the media and selectors. Sehwag also said that he was not comfortable with the Australian.         
	I am not interested in India. Not interested in Indian cricket, Chappell was quoted as saying by a cricket website.         
	You can check with Kiran More (then the chief selector, what information I was sharing with him), Chappell said.         
	I am now not going to be associated with the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) also, the Aussie added.         
	Incidentally, the RCA had hired his services for its academy in Jaipur as consultant. He had also been entrusted with the task of spotting and grooming Twenty20 talent by IPLs Jaipur franchise.         
	Chappell is now the new Head Coach of the Cricket Australia Centre of Excellence (COE) in Brisbane.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhullar rises to tied 11th
                                                     Bhullar rises to tied 11th

	Jakarta: The British Open experience seemed to have done world of good to Gaganjeet Bhullar who carded a stellar four-under 68 to rise to tied 11th in the Indonesia President Invitational golf tournament on Friday.         
	Meanwhile, it was all over for seasoned campaigner Gaurav Ghei (146) and his three compatriots  Manav Jaini (146), Digvijay Singh (150) and C. Muniyappa (145)  who failed to make the cut in the Asian Tour event.         
	Anirban Lahiri (138) brought home the best card by an Indian turning in five-under 67 to leap to tied 15th before early darkness left 15 players stranded midway through their second round.         
	Thai veteran Thaworn Wiratchant (132) carded his second straight six-under 66 in near darkness to grab a one shot lead over Australian Adam Blyth, who fired a matching 66 at the Damai Indah Golf  Bumi Serpong Damai course.         
	Bhullar, who made his British Open debut at Turnberry last week, played flawless golf and his bogey-free round was studded with four birdies, three of which came on his back nine.         
	Lahiri followed up his opening round of 71 with a sterling 67 and the second hole bogey was the lone blip in an otherwise impressive card, sprinkled with six birdies.         
	Amandeep Johl (140) and Rahil Gangjee (140) also made the cut, while Himmat Rai, who carded 72 Thursday and was one-under after 15 holes Friday, would return hoping to make the mark.

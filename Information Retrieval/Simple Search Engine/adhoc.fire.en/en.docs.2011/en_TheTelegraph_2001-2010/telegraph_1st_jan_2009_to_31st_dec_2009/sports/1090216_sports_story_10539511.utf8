The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bolt still the king of speed
                                                   Bolt still the king of speed
                      
	Kingston: Usain Bolt opened his 2009 season here the same way he ran to the sprint golds at the Beijing Olympics, slowing before the finish but crossing the line well ahead of his rivals.         
	The Jamaican star, and worlds fastest man, turned in a creditable 400m performance at the Camperdown Classic, winning his heat in 46.35 seconds to capture the three-heat final Saturday. That was a good time, Bolt said. I opened last season with 46.9, so this is a good time.         
	Bolt, who ran in lane five, jogged the final 100m after getting out of the blocks fast, slowing on the backstretch and surging until his shutdown at the finish, ending with a smile on his face. The first 300m was good. The last 100m needs some work, he said with a wide grin.         
	Bolt said before the race that he was behind in his season preparations compared to last year, in part because of travel and distractions as a result of his Olympic heroics six months ago.         
	Yohan Blake, Jamaicas national junior 100m record holder at 10.11, was second in the event and overall in 46.80sec.         
	Annsert White, the heat one winner in 46.86sec, and Olympian Ricardo Chambers, the heat two winner in 46.98, were third and fourth overall.         
	Bolt, named Jamaicas 2008 Sportsman of the Year on Friday, set world records at the Olympics in winning the 100m gold in 9.69 seconds and the 200m title in 19.30 and then helped Jamaica to 4x100m relay gold.         
	In both sprint races, Bolt won by strides and left his rivals stunned and straining for a distant second. Former 100m world record-holder Asafa Powell was also in action Saturday but at another Jamaican meet.         
	In the Western Relays, staged in Spanish Town, Powell led his MVP Track Club team to a 4x100m run of 38.72sec. Beijing Olympic 100m champion Shelly-Ann Fraser, also of the MVP club, led her relay team to victory in 43.35sec.

                                                   Bye for Nehwal
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Title aspirant Saina Nehwal received an encouraging draw in the world badminton championships to be played in Hyderabad from August 10 to 16.         
	The draw, held in the capital on Tuesday, Arjuna Awardee Saina received a bye in the first round of womens singles.         
	Given Sainas current form, there is a distinct possibility that the sixth seeded Indian girl would move to the quarter finals without facing any problem.         
	Sainas coach and former All England champion Pullela Gopichand, however, was confident that the Hyderabad star would make it to the last four of the championships.         
	In the quarter finals, Saina would meet second seed Lin Wang, Gopichand predicted. But there is nothing to worry about. Saina has beaten the Chinese before. She should be able to do it again in front of her home crowd.         
	In the third round, Saina may face 10th seeded Bulgarian Petya Nedelcheva.         
	The draw was made in the presence of Commonwealth Games Federation president Mike Fennell, Badminton World Federation vice-president Paisan Rangsikitpho and Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Suresh Kalmadi. Former All England champion Prakash Padukone was also present.         
	Padukone said even though Saina had a good chance of bagging the title in Hyderabad, the Chinese stars would once again dominate the championships.         
	Among other Indians, Sayali Gokhale will meet Jie Wao of the Netherlands in the first round and Aditi Mutatkar will face 11th seed German Juliane Schenk, a former European junior champion. Hong Kongs Zhou Mi is the top seed.         
	In mens singles first round, Indias Chetan Anand, 15th seed, will face South Korean Ji Hoon Hong, Arvind Bhat will come across ninth seed Yu Hsing Hsieh of Chinese Taipei while P. Kashyap will take on Irans Ali Shahhoseini. Malaysias Lee Wei Chong has been seeded first while Chinas Chen Jin is second.

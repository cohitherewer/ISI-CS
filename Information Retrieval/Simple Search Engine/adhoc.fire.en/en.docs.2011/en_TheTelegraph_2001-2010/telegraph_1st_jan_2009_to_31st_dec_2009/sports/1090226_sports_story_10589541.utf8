	Manchester United were so nearly the special ones here Tuesday night, players of the quality of Michael Carrick and Ryan Giggs giving Jose Mourinhos disappointing Inter Milan a masterclass in the art of possession, particularly in the first-half. Mourinhos side revived after the break but Sir Alex Fergusons champions should have come home with at least two away goals, such were the number of chances that fell their way.         
	When Ferguson first began guiding United in the European Cup in the mid-Nineties, they were regularly punished, particularly before crowing Italian crowds, for laxness in possession. Not now.         
	Ferguson has taught his players how to keep the ball, a strength that served them so well here. Carrick embodied this expertise at ball-winning and distribution in front of the watching England manager, Fabio Capello. Mourinho must have been impressed too.         
	Footballs pre-gentrification generation were more fully represented, typified by a banner that read: United, Kids, Wife  In That Order.         
	Surprise rippled through these United fans on hearing that Wayne Rooney was being kept in reserve. Yet Ferguson has pulled off such shocks before, notably with a similar midfield against Chelsea and any Doubting Thomases were swiftly silenced. Gaffers cracking up? No chance.         
	Ferguson knew what he was doing, sending his players out in 4-2-3-1 formation, clearly wanting to protect a back-four missing Nemanja Vidic. How they responded, dominating the first half with a wonderful display of possession football.         
	When Patrice Evra and Jonny Evans wasted the ball just before the interval, gasps of disbelief almost sprung from the terraces.         
	And how United actually reached the break without a goal was a travesty of sporting justice, pure and simple. Inter became so disheartened in the first period that their reserve keeper, Francesco Toldo, was even cautioned for dissent.         
	Every man in red responded to Fergusons instructions and his call to arms. Darren Fletcher joined Carrick in shielding the defence while Giggs, Cristiano Ronaldo and Park Ji-sung pushed on in support of Dimitar Berbatov.         
	Ronaldo clearly relished the task, the European Footballer of the Year possibly stung by all Mourinhos claims that Zlatan Ibrahimovic was in his league. So inspired, Ronaldo could have laid claim to the match-ball within 10 minutes.         
	He twice went close with free-kicks, and in between demanded a desperate save from Julio Cesar. Running on to a Giggs corner, Ronaldo thundered in a header that Inters keeper somehow clawed away.         
	United were composed in possession, working triangles around black-and-blue shirts, thrilling their fans. Ferguson clearly ordered his players to dictate the tempo, dominating possession, taking the sting out of the crowd. Inters fans had been so pumped up for the European champions visit that even Uniteds kit-man, Albert Morgan, was treated to some choice Italian invective before kick-off.         
	In seeking to silence the Inter faithful, Carrick and Giggs were immense, rarely risking losing the ball, always threatening something special. Carrick dribbled through the middle, a sinewy run of growing menace, his enterprise curtailed only by a trip from Javier Zanetti. The referee, Luis Medina Cantalejo, was having none of Zanettis appeals, signalling a free-kick for United. Up stepped Giggs, up went the free-kick, but again failing to beat Cesar.         
	Inter had pursued Giggs signature all through the Nineties, and their players tried vainfully to catch him here. Racing on to a sublime Carrick pass, the Welshman could have squared to Park and Berbatov but instead went alone, gliding past Rivas Lopez. Frustratingly for United, Giggs shot was brilliantly saved at the near-post by Cesar, whose excellence prevented humiliation for Mourinhos side.         
	Still United dominated. Cesar saved another Ronaldo dead-ball special. Then the World Player of the Year glanced a header just wide, again following a fine cross from the ubiquitous Giggs. United were rampant and Inter were relieved to make the break intact.         
	The goal that Giggs deserved almost arrived with 15 minutes left, Uniteds captain dribbling through only for his shot to be blocked brilliantly by Ivan Cordoba. Yet the best chance fell to Inters Argentine midfielder Esteban Cambiasso, who missed from close range.         
	Rooney then arrived  with a bang, the forward clattering into Cambiasso with a force that could have brought red, rather than the yellow brandished by Medina Cantalejo. The San Siro whistled in derision.         
	Cesar denied United again at the death, from another Ronaldo free-kick. The Portuguese won it after being fouled by Cordoba and then delivered a vicious shot that struck the goalkeeper  how much he knew about it was debatable.

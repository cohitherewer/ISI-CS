The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhullar No. 10 in Order of Merit
                                                   Bhullar No. 10 in Order of Merit
                      
	Sentosa: His maiden Asian Tour title at the Indonesia President Invitational has propelled young Indian golfer Gaganjeet Bhullar into the top-10 of the Asian Order of Merit, which continues to be led by Thai Thongchai Jaidee.         
	The 20-year-old clinched the title with an emphatic two-stroke victory over Australias Adam Blyth on Sunday.         
	Victory was worth $63,400, moving the Indian up to the 10th place on the Order of Merit. Bhullar said the morale-boosting win has also given him the belief that he can establish himself on the world stage like illustrated compatriot and reigning Asian Tour Order of Merit champion Jeev Milkha Singh.         
	Ive won three times on the Indian circuit this year and my goal a few months back was to win on the Asian Tour. This victory will get me into all the co-sanctioned events now and will give me a lot of confidence in my coming years, said Bhullar.         
	From his days as the countrys top amateur in 2004 to winning the team silver medal at the Doha Asian Games in 2006, Bhullars talent has never been in doubt. The youngster from Kapurthala turned professional in 2006.         
	Anthony Kang of the US is in second place and Jyoti Randhawa is third on the list.           (PTI)

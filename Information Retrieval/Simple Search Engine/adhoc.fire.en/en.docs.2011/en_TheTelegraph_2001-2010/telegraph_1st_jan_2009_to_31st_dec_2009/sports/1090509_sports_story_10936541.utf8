The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India favourites 
                                                   India favourites 
                      
	Kuantan (Malaysia): High on form and confidence after last months Azlan Shah Cup triumph, defending champions India will start as overwhelming favourites in the seven-nation Asia Cup hockey that begins here on Saturday.         
	However, Indias road to the title wont be an easy one, as the event will provide Asias top hockey nations an opportunity to book their place in the 2010 World Cup to be held in New Delhi.         
	India, twice winners of the title in 2003 and 2007, will face stiff competition from South Korea, Malaysia, three-time champions Pakistan, Japan and China. All the nations will be vying for the lone place in the 2010 World Cup available from the tournament.         
	Although, the eight-time Olympic champions have secured their ticket to the World Cup as the host nation, coach-in-charge Harendra Singh has warned against complacency creeping in among the players and said he wont settle for anything less than gold.         
	We are here to win and nothing else matters. As hosts we are assured of a place in the 2010 World Cup. But we want to show that we are the top team in Asia. We want to earn our place as champions. So there is no question of us taking it easy, he said.         
	Apart from Bangladesh, Pakistan and China are the other two teams in Indias Pool B, while South Korea, Malaysia, Japan and Sri Lanka rounds off Pool A. (PTI)

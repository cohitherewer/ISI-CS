The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ruling group in BCCI was prepared for the worst
                                                   Ruling group in BCCI was prepared for the worst
    - RCA, which took the lead in ousting dalmiya, now in the opposition           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: It may not ever be acknowledged, but the ruling group in the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had actually been preparing for the worst in Sundays elections in Jaipur.         
	That Lalit Modi would lose in his own backyard and that the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA), which played a leading role in the Jagmohan Dalmiya groups ouster, in late 2005, would go out of its fold.         
	Initially, there was much concern as Modi is a vice-president (Central) of the BCCI and it wasnt straightaway known whether defeat would affect his continuing in that capacity... The constitution was studied to clear the air and allow easy breathing, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	The Memorandum and Rules and Regulations of the BCCI form its constitution.         
	It was about 10 days ago that word started to get around that, irrespective of what hed done for the RCA, Modi and his panel would still lose... It was to avoid being caught off guard that the constitution was then gone through in detail, the well-placed source added.         
	Modi, whod earlier been vice-president from North (courtesy buddy-in-arms Inderjit Singh Bindra), which wasnt his zone, took Centrals seat in the last AGM, last September.         
	Such an adjustment had become necessary as (Vidarbhas) Shashank Manohar was succeeding Sharad Pawar as the BCCI president and the mood within the ruling group wasnt in favour of giving that seat to UPs Rajeev Shukla.         
	Shukla, a member of Parliament, was once very close to Dalmiya.         
	Unless a technicality is somehow unearthed by somebody, Modi can remain a BCCI vice-president till September 2010, at least, when the question of whether he should get a third (and final) year or not will take centre stage.         
	The two-plus-one formula is going to be at play then.         
	Its another matter, of course, whether one who wont be representing his state in the BCCI ought to remain its vice-president.         
	Having often preached moral values, particularly in the Dalmiya case, Modi should review his position.         
	Modis thinking has certainly been progressive and he would get things done, but hed begun to project himself as bigger than even the BCCI.         
	Forget what his opponents thought, that didnt go down well with everybody within the ruling group too.         
	So, its not that all wouldve shed tears once the results (a rout, really) were known in the afternoon.         
	Significantly, in intra-BCCI politics, Modi and Bindra were (till recently) seen as opponents of the Manohar-N.Srinivasan duo. Today, while the former is the president, the latter is the secretary and aspires to succeed Manohar.         
	Modi has learnt one lesson  that the RCA wasnt a personal asset... Another remains to be learnt  that the Indian Premier League isnt an individuals fiefdom either, is what a Modi-baiter said soon after his defeat.         
	Its to be seen just how chastened (if at all) Modi is in the lead-up to and during the Leagues second edition, which begins on April 10.

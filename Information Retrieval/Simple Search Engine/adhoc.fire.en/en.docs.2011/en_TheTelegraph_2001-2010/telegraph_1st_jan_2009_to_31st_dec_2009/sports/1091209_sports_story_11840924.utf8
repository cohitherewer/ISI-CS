The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal shot out for 193
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bengal shot out for 193

	Kanpur: A fortnight back, Sri Lankas new-ball bowlers Chanaka Welegedara and Angelo Mathews failed to get a breakthrough against India on a helpful Green Park strip.         
	On Tuesday, Uttar Pradeshs pace trio of Praveen Kumar, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Rudra Pratap Singh ensured that they made full use of the conditions during the first hour against Bengal and got a favourable result.         
	Uttar Pradesh dismissed Bengal for 193 in only 78.1 overs in a crucial Super League (Group B) encounter of the Ranji Trophy.         
	Save former India captain Sourav Ganguly, who scored 66 and shared a fruitful stand of 81 for the fourth wicket with opener Arindam Das (46), none of the other Bengal batsmen looked comfortable against swinging deliveries.         
	Sent in to bat by UP captain Mohammed Kaif, the visitors started on a disastrous note as Deep Dasgupta (0) was trapped leg before by an incoming delivery from Praveen.         
	However, television replays showed that Dasgupta was at least a foot and half outside the crease and the delivery hit him above the knee roll.         
	After the dismissal, Arindam and No. 3 batsman Wriddhiman Saha (7) went into a shell.         
	They simply couldnt find the gaps. Wriddhiman was particularly clueless against Bhuvneshwars outgoing deliveries.         
	The duo were able to put only 19 runs in 14.1 over before RP, coming in as a one-change, got one to come back into the Bengal glovesman.         
	Wriddhiman could only manage to get an inside edge which popped up to Shiva Kant Shukla at forward short leg to end his 37-ball agony.         
	Manoj Tiwarys unfortunate run out left Bengal tottering at 20 for three.         
	It was a poor call from his partner Arindam which led to Tiwarys run out.         
	Sourav and Arindam then steadied the ship.         
	Although a few deliveries from RP looked like troubling the master batsman, the former India captain soon found his touch.         
	A signature cover drive followed by a square drive showed that when it comes to technique and temperament, he is unmatchable.         
	The former India captain also dispatched a short delivery from Praveen to the deep mid-wicket boundary.         
	Arindam, on the other end, gained confidence and started playing shots.         
	Sourav also gave left-arm spinner Praveen Gupta the charge hitting him over long-on for a six, while Arindam square cut leggie Piyush Chawla for a boundary.         
	However, after doing all the hard work and batting close to three-and-a-half hours, Arindam was trapped in front by Chawla.         
	Sourav, who batted for 171 minutes, was the fifth Bengal batsman out when he was trapped plumb in-front off Chawla trying to work the bowler towards the leg.         
	Skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla (39) hung for some time but lacked support from the other end. Rohan Gavaskar (20) edged an away going delivery from Praveen.         
	There was no resistance from the lower order as the last four batsmen could manage only eight runs among themselves.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Captain Colin will scare US
                                                     Captain Colin will scare US
            MARK REASON            Colin Montgomerie                           
	Colin Montgomerie is set to be one of the great Ryder Cup captains. The 45-year-old Scot has frequently contributed to global warming in his 20-year career on the European Tour. A missed putt on the final green would send the lava streaming from his ears. But when it came to the Ryder Cup all of Montgomeries warmth was reserved for his teammates and the heat of battle.         
	As a player he has a phenomenal record. Montgomerie and Bernhard Langer are the only two Europeans to have played in five winning teams and in eight Ryder Cup appearances Monty has never lost a singles match. When Sam Torrance needed a go-to guy in 2002, he asked Montgomerie to head the singles order and begin Europes irrepressible surge to victory.         
	Montgomerie has always been a different man when it came to the Ryder Cup. Putts that would have finished short in strokeplay tournaments were poured into the middle of the hole. He was the man the Americans feared. They may well fear him even more now he is captain.         
	Many in the game believe that Montgomerie will be just as good a Ryder Cup leader as he has been a player. Peter McEvoy, arguably British golfs greatest captain yet, played with him as an amateur at Walker Cups and Eisenhower Trophys in the Eighties and believes that the Scot has everything it takes.         
	He said: His enthusiasm and box office appeal will be very good for the Ryder Cup commercially. Monty will never be out of the newspapers. He loves it. But hes also got a really strong winning instinct.         
	I think he has been held back by a one-dimensional game, but has a hugely winning attitude that he will bring to the Ryder Cup captaincy. He will do what it takes. I cant see a negative.         
	McEvoy also reckons that one of Montgomeries weaknesses will paradoxically constitute one of the strengths of his captaincy. He said: When I played with him he was not a team man, not one of the boys, but a bit separate. Thats a good thing for a captain. You need to be half a step away, because you have to make some pretty hard decisions, particularly when you tell people theyre not playing.

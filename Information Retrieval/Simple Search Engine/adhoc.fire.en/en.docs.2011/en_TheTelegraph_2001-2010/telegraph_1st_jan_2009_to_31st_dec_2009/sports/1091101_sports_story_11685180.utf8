The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ronaldo wants Rooney at Real 
                                                   Ronaldo wants Rooney at Real 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	London: Cristiano Ronaldo believes his former Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney should follow him to Real Madrid. Ronaldo left Old Trafford in the summer for a record 80 million fee to complete a dream move to the Spanish giants.         
	The Portuguese winger immediately impressed with Madrid scoring nine goals in seven games before suffering an ankle injury which has kept him on the sidelines for the past month.         
	While he admits Rooney is unlikely to leave England any time soon, Ronaldo believes the 24-year-old would fit in at the Bernabeu.         
	Wayne would be a sensation out here. I think we could do with Rooney to help us out, Ronaldo told a tabloid. He would be brilliant if he came. This is the ideal place for the worlds best players and theres little doubt he is one of them.         
	Wayne has all the skill and determination you need to make a fine career here. He has shown just how good he is over the last few years in England.         
	And theres no doubt he would be the same sort of player in Spain. It would be lovely to see him here one day at Real Madrid.         
	I realise it would take a lot for him to move from England. He loves the country, he loves Manchester and he is a Liverpool boy. And United is a good club for him. But you never know what could happen in the future.         
	There are calls in Spain for Real coach Pellegrini to be sacked following a run of under par results which has seen the Madrid side lose three of their last four matches.         
	Most notable was a 4-0 defeat at the hands of third division Alcorcon in the Copa del Rey, but defending his coach, Ronaldo reiterated the need for a realistic period of time for a team top gel when so many new players have been brought in.         
	Claiming that fans in Spain expect to see instant results, Ronaldo added: The fans are totally different here to England. There is far more pressure than in Manchester and the Bernabeu crowd is particularly tough.         
	Yes, its a bad moment but every team has these. No side in the world can be at the top all the time, its impossible, but maybe here they dont accept that. Madrid have to win every game and the people just wont accept defeat. But Madrid has so many new players and a new coach that its very difficult to blend together immediately.

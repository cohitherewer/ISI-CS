            STAR RACER                                    
	Calcutta: Trainer Darius Byramjis filly Gloriosa stopped the Juggernaut of Credit Squeeze  a four in-a-row winner, including the Colts Trial Stakes  on her way to winning the all-important race in her career, the 2,000m Calcutta Monsoon Derby on Sunday. Gloriosa, who went to the start as a joint favourite with Credit Squeeze, was ridden well off the pace. In the home straight, her jockey C. Alford brought the Honour And Gory-Tarnished Lady filly with a dazzling run on the wide out to beat Credit Squeeze by two lengths. Alford ended the day with a creditable treble through the victories of two other winners, Arktouros and Accessor.RESULTS

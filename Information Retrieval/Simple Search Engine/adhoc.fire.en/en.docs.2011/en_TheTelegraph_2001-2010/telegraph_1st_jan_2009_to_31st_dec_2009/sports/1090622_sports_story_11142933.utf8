The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | My vision is to stay ahead of Australia, India: Mickey
                                                     My vision is to stay ahead of Australia, India: Mickey
    - SAs highly-rated coach looks back and to the future             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL             Mickey Arthur                                 
	London: After scripting near-perfect cricket in five matches, South Africa got beaten by an inspired Pakistan in the World T20 semi-finals. Another win, at Trent Bridge, and the Mickey Arthur-coached South Africans wouldve been at Lords on Sunday.         
	Arthur, who has played a significant role in South Africas remarkable progress, spoke to The Telegraph during the tournament. Incidentally, hes just 41.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Youve completed four years as South Africas coach...  
	A I look back with much pride... Weve achieved a lot... When I took over, we were fifth and sixth, I think, in the Test and ODI rankings, respectively... Today, were No.2 and No.1... Weve backed some good players in this period and, in my opinion, changed the brand of South African cricket.  
	One change is that theres flair as opposed to being mechanical. Do you agree?         
	Weve definitely looked at changing the mindset and, nowadays, we get to play two spinners in the XI... Thats a huge change.         
	So, who deserves the credit?         
	The players have to get a big chunk... Theyre the ones whove made this brand successful.         
	The rapport between the captain, Graeme Smith, and you has also played a huge role...         
	Graeme and I clicked from the start... Weve had the same ideas, the same vision and weve indeed worked hand in hand... Our relationship is very strong and, if theres harmony at the top, then theres more success... It works like a home... Harmony breeds good things, chaos doesnt.         
	Your take on Graemes growth both as a person and as a captain?         
	One should remember that Graeme got the captaincy at 22, a very young age to carry the weight of a nation... But hes been fantastic and I have nothing but admiration for the way he handles himself on and off the field... Hes getting better and better and is respected both by teammates and the opposition.         
	A little over a year ago, you were absolutely ready to end your innings over the quota issue...         
	I was prepared to lose my job... I fought over the issue... I felt strongly about it... I wanted players on merit, but with a transformation bias... Today, weve got a system thats producing top class players from all backgrounds... Weve got all ethnic groups in our team and thats great. I do see the diversity in our nation as a strength.         
	Was your approach influenced by the demanding tours which then lay ahead  to India and to Australia?         
	I didnt want to give opportunities on the Bangladesh tour, which preceded the trip to India, but to build the team for (a) India and (b) for the tour of Australia... We needed to build and consolidate.         
	Does the quota system exist?         
	Theres a target system and we work towards it all the time... At the end of the day, thats becoming less and less obvious... Across the board, teams are now being picked almost on merit. Our feeder system is producing good players. Personally, everything I do is with a transformation bias.         
	How have you handled pressure?         
	(Smiles) It has been an enjoyable journey... Ive grown as an individual and Ive seen respect for me grow... When I got the job, it was Mickey who?... Its rather different now... I see myself as a cricket thinker and my degree is cricket... I backed myself when I got the job and Ive continued to back myself. Pressure comes with the territory.         
	What should a coach be doing?         
	He should have a vision and be meticulous with his planning... He should look to take a lot of the pressure off the captain and take the back seat once the game begins. Obviously, the coach and the captain need to drive in the same direction. If the captain is a CEO, then the coach is like a consultant.         
	The captain, quite clearly, is the boss...         
	Ultimately its the captain, yes... Of course, the coach too is accountable. Within the South African team, Graeme and I are clear about responsibilities... I run the show till the match-eve team meeting, Graeme takes over from there. I become his assistant.         
	Youve mentioned vision a couple of times. Whats yours?         
	Its a cliche, but Ive wanted South Africa to be the best in the business, getting there through a strong management style... Having a fantastic system and a really energetic structure... For too long there was inclusiveness in South African cricket, I wanted a shift... Were getting where we want to be.         
	Has it been tough handling the very gifted but temperamental Herschelle Gibbs?         
	Not at all... Actually, hes the easiest guy to handle... Ive been straight and honest with him and hes responded very well. You need to be honest with him... There have been a few hassles, but no problems.         
	How do you react if the team has had an off day?         
	Try to be as calm as I can... Ill be hard on the players if the defeat is self-inflicted. If, on the other hand, the opposition did much better, then that will have to be accepted... Theres nothing that can be done except to plan better and move ahead... Hope for the next day to be a good day.         
	Beating Australia in Australia (both in Tests and ODIs) earlier this year was the defining moment in your career. Some months on, how do you look back on that achievement?         
	Was a dream come true... In some ways, one vision came to an end and another  of going to the next level  began... Its easy to become complacent once youve achieved your goal, but I told the players that we cant sit back and relax because every opponent would be planning to get that one step ahead of us...         
	What really is the next level?         
	Look, I dont think any team will dominate the way Australia did in recent years, but Australia, India and South Africa will have ding-dong battles in the years to come... The South African team has to be prepared and my vision is to stay ahead of Australia and India.         
	Your thoughts on compatriot Gary Kirsten, the India coach?         
	Hes perfect for the environment... As Ive told you, the Indian players are immensely gifted, theres so much of natural talent... However, if theres a problem, its that there are too many individuals... The Indians need to play as a team.         
	What would you tell rookie coaches?         
	Be prepared... Make sure you have a plan and be ready to back that plan... Dont deviate, because that could cause confusion and you may end up losing the plot entirely.         
	The last one: Just how much of a threat is T20 to the more established forms of cricket?         
	Each format has its place, but its a fact that T20 has brought a whole new audience... My belief is that Test cricket will remain the ultimate test, with the 50-over game being there and thereabouts... The World Cup, though, will be different... T20 is the funky, energetic wave of cricket and has enhanced the skills-level of the players... The way forward, internationally, would be to have a World T20 every two years and one T20 during tours... The way I look at it, T20 is for the franchises.

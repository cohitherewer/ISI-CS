                                                   Board set to offer code guidance
                      
	Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is set to conduct an education programme over the next two months to instruct domestic cricketers on the International Cricket Councils World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada)-compliant anti-doping code.         
	The anti-doping code has to filter down to the domestic level and we are planning to conduct an education programme for domestic cricketers. We will think about all other things once we are through with this, the Boards chief administrative officer Prof. Ratnakar Shetty said Tuesday.         
	We will also have to include domestic coaches and physios in the programme, he said.         
	Shetty insisted that the first step was to conduct the programme and was not prepared to talk on the creation of a medical panel or about the testing of samples taken from the players.         
	We plan to do it over the next two months, he said.         
	The code has a controversial whereabouts clause, which requires players in the testing pool to inform the dope-testing authorities about their whereabouts every day of the year, three months in advance.         
	The concerned Indian cricketers had raised objections by insisting that their security would be compromised if they sign the clause and that their privacy too would be infringed.         
	The Board has accepted their view and told the ICC it was an unacceptable part of the anti-doping code.

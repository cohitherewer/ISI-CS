	New Delhi: Seasoned Spanish coach Jose Brasa is tipped to be named Indias national hockey coach next month.         
	According to sources in the ministry of sports, Brasa will arrive in the capital later this week and will be interviewed by the ministry officials and the members of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) ad hoc committee.         
	Brasa is an International Hockey Federation (FIH) Masters coaching degree holder and has also completed the FIH High Performance coaching course.         
	Brasa has coached the Spanish womens team to gold medal in the 1992 Olympics.         
	A ministry official told The Telegraph that two foreign coaches have been shortlisted for the interview but Brasa stands the better chance to get the job.         
	Brasa has been called first, the official said.         
	Later, an Argentine coach may also come to Delhi for discussions. But if the Spanish coach is found suitable, the Argentine may finally not be called.         
	According to ad hoc committee sources, a foreign coach will take over the national team immediately after the four-nation tournament to be played at the end of this month in Chandigarh.         
	Indias failure to qualify for the Beijing Olympics, following the teams loss in qualifying in Chile, led to heightened demands for the appointment of a foreign coach.         
	At the moment, the team is being coached by former international Harendra Singh.         
	Sources said that the ad hoc committee has been looking for a foreign coach for quite some but top coaches were reluctant to come to India after Australian legend Ric Charlesworth resigned as the technical director of Indian hockey last July.         
	The Charlesworth episode didnt enhance Indias prestige in the international hockey circle, an official said.         
	After Charlesworths exit, M.K. Kaushik was appointed coach but the former international had to be released immediately after the sports ministry directed Kaushik to remain with the womens national team.         
	The new foreign coach will be given contract till the Asian Games.

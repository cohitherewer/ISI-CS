The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indian fight ends 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Indian fight ends 
                      
	Khanty Mansiysk (Russia): Indian challenge in the World Chess Cup ended after three of their Grandmasters wilted under pressure and lost their must-win games here.         
	Grandmasters Surya Sekhar Ganguly, Krishnan Sasikiran and Sandipan Chanda lost their return games with identical 0-2 margins against their respective opponents to bow out of the prestigious event.         
	All the three Indians out of the seven that had started the tournament had lost the first game and needed victories in their return games to remain in the fray. Sandipan went for the Kings Indian defense but it did not turn out be a good tactic against Russian Dmitry Jakovenko who seized the initiative early in the middle game.         
	Sandipan tried in vain for counterplay by sacrificing a pawn but ended up losing another in quick time. The Russian gave no chance to the Indian thereafter and wrapped up the game.         
	Asian champion Surya faced the Chabonenko Slav against Wang Hao of China who played black. The opening saw the Indian relishing a little advantage that was quickly neutralised by Hao through the exchange of queens in the middle game.         
	An error forced Surya to part with a pawn and his Chinese opponent seized the opportunity to get the upper hand.         
	Krishnan Sasikiran could have possibly agreed to a draw against Etienne Bacrot of France but the Indian took the practical approach and tried hard to level scores from a Botwinnink Slav.         
	The final endgame was with two Bishops and pawns in which Suryas lack of material had the decisive say.         
	The biggest upset of the Cup was, however, recorded by Wesley So who showed stalwart Vassily Ivanchuk the exit door.         
	Having won the first game with black, Wesley was clinical in his approach and got an easy draw to move to the third round. Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan and Russian Alexander Morozevich were the other stars who were shown the door.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Visa delay for Indians
                                                   Visa delay for Indians
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Nothing seems to be going right for the All India Football Federation (AIFF) and the national team.         
	A day after the two Calcutta majors  Mohun Bagan and East Bengal  released their players after much persuasion, the teams tour of Dubai and Spain got delayed by at least two days because of non-availability of visa to Spain. The team was supposed to leave for Dubai on Thursday but the federation sources said now it can only leave on Saturday.         
	Obviously the team will lose two days of practice in Dubai, sources added.         
	The AIFF general secretary, Alberto Colaco, however, said: We are trying our best to send the team on Friday. In that case, the team will miss practice for only a day.         
	The Indian captain Bhaichung Bhutia said the entire squad was looking forward to the tour of Spain. Obviously it is going to be a new experience to use the facilities of a club like Barcelona, he said.         
	There was, meanwhile, some shocking news from Goa, where the India under-16 team is training under British coach Colin Toal.         
	Out of the 30 players called for the camp, 16 have been found to be over-age after MRI tests were conducted on all players. While Toal, the technical director, it is believed, is extremely upset with the development, the AIFF is still looking into the matter.         
	The ministry of sports had yet to clear its position whether or not it would bear the airfare of the team for the tours. A final decision will only come in the next couple of days.

	Durham: Graeme Swann took five for 28 as England bowled Australia out for 176 and won by four wickets on Sunday to avoid being the first side to lose a one-day International series 0-7.         
	Although Australia won the series 6-1, England were spurred by an opening stand of 106 between Andrew Strauss and Joe Denly, and will go to the Champions Trophy in South Africa later this week on a winning note.         
	Despite a mini collapse to 141 for five, England reached the target with 10 overs to spare.         
	Ricky Ponting made 53 to become the third highest one-day scorer of all time, but Australia had no answer to the off-spin of Swann, who also caught opener Shane Watson before Australia could start scoring. Michael Hussey contributed 49 and Michael Clarke 38.         
	Watson lasted only four balls before edging a delivery from Jimmy Anderson to first slip, and Tim Paine, who scored 111 at Trent Bridge on Thursday, made only four before snicking one to wicket-keeper Matthew Prior off Onions.         
	That left Australia in trouble at 17 for two in the fourth over, but Ponting and Clarke steadied the innings with a third-wicket stand of 79, during which the Australian captain overtook Pakistans Inzamam-ul Haq to move up to third in the all-time batting list.         
	Ponting reached his 68th one-day half-century by pulling a short ball from Paul Collingwood over square leg for his eighth boundary, before he mistimed a delivery from Swann to Collingwood at mid-on.         
	Clarke was the next to go, when he was beaten by Eoin Morgans throw from fine leg, and Swann bowled Cameron White for one to leave the Australians on 112 for five.         
	James Hopes added 11 off 23 balls before he lobbed an easy catch to bowler Swann, and the spinner removed Mitchell Johnson and Brett Lee in the same over.         
	Swann conceded only 28 runs off his 10 overs and Englands other spinner, Owais Shah, caught Nathan Hauritz off his own bowling for three.         
	Hussey defied England by hitting Anderson for four and six off successive balls, but was out one short of his 50 when he lofted a catch to Joe Denly to give Tim Bresnan a wicket.         
	Facing a modest victory target, England openers Strauss and Denly took few risks and moved slowly but comfortably to a half-century partnership in the 12th over.         
	Strauss reached 47 with only four boundaries before he gave an easy catch to Ben Hilfenhaus off spinner Hauritz in the 21st over. By then, however, England appeared to be cruising at 106 for one.         
	Denly went on to reach his half-century by hitting his eighth four off Hopes, but the opener was run out by Ponting for 53.           (AP)

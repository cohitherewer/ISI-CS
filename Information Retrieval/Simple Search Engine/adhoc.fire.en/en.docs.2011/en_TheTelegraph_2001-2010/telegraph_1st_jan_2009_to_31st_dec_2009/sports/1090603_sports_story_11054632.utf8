The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Phil plans return to PGA Tour
                                                   Phil plans return to PGA Tour
                      
	Dublin: Phil Mickelson plans a brief return to the PGA Tour in time for the US Open.         
	The worlds No. 2 player suspended his schedule indefinitely upon announcing two weeks ago that his wife, Amy, has been diagnosed with breast cancer. Recent tests have given them hope the cancer has been caught early, with more tests over the next month.         
	Mickelson intends to return next week at the St Jude Championship in Memphis, Tennessee, then play the following week in the US Open at Bethpage Black, according to a person informed of the plans.         
	The person spoke on condition of anonymity because Mickelson had not announced his decision.         
	We heard there was a possibility he would play, St Jude Championship spokesman Phil Cannon said. That would be great.         
	Mickelson is a sentimental favourite at every US Open, where at age 38 he already has tied the record for most runner-up finishes with four. He is especially popular in New York, and his presence at Bethpage Black figured to bring an emotional and raucous response.         
	He has never finished worse than fourth in his four US Opens held in New York.         
	Mickelson first thought surgery for his 37-year-old wife could happen as early as a few weeks since the announcement, but that has been pushed back for another month. (AP)

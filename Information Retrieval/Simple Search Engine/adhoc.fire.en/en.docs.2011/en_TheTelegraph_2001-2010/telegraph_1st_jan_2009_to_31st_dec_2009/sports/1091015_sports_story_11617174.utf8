The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mondal ban upheld, fined Rs 10,000
                                                   Mondal ban upheld, fined Rs 10,000
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                Dipak Mondal       
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Wednesday came down heavily on Dipak Mondal and imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on the Mohun Bagan defender for his unsporting actions in the I-League match against JCT at Calcutta.         
	The AIFF disciplinary committee, which met under the chairmanship of NA Khan, not only rejected Mondals plea to allow him to play in the derby match against East Bengal on October 25, but also found him guilty of trying to manhandle the referee.         
	Mondal, who was called in twice during the marathon meeting that lasted nearly five hours, was shown the video evidence of how he pushed and abused the referee A Rowan during his teams defeat against the Phagwara side.         
	Initially, Mondal refused to accept his faults but later pleaded guilty after he was shown the video clippings, sources said.         
	The bevaviour of the Mohun Bagan officials on the bench was most disappointing, said a committee member. When the referee was being pushed around, none of the Bagan officials tried to intervene and discipline their own players.         
	In another development, the AIFF expressed their unhappiness over the role of IFA in providing security to all concern during the I-League. It has also directed Mahindra United midfielder Steven Dias to return Rs. 2 lakh to East Bengal, which he accepted as an advance from the Calcutta club last season, by October 25.

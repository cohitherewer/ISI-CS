The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nico to leave Williams
                                                   Nico to leave Williams
                      
	Abu Dhabi: Nico Rosberg will leave the Williams Formula One team after the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the German driver said on Thursday.         
	It is my last race for Williams, and so thats it really, Rosberg told reporters at the gleaming new Yas Marina circuit that makes its debut on Sunday with the sports first day-to-night race.         
	Rosberg, son of Finlands 1982 world champion Keke, refused to say which team he was switching to.         
	However, he has been strongly linked to new world champions Brawn, with Britains 2009 title winner Jenson Button his likely team mate. McLaren, who also have Mercedes engines, would be an alternative. (Reuters)

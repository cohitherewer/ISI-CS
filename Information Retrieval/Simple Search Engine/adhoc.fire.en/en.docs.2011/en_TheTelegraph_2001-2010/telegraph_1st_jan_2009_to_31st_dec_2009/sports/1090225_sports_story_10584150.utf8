The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ivanchuk test for Anand
                                                   Ivanchuk test for Anand
                      
	Linares: World champion Viswanathan Anand, rejuvenated after a days rest, will hope to crash through Ukrainian Vassily Ivanchuks defence in the fifth round of the Magistral Ciudad De Leon Chess tournament here.         
	Anand, trailing joint leaders Levon Aronian of Armenia and Alexander Grischuk of Russia by just half a point, following his two victories, one loss and a draw, will hope to bridge the gap in the first half of the 14-round tournament when he sits behind black pieces against Ivanchuk.         
	Ivanchuk, who has drawn all his games so far, is joined by Magnus Carlsen at the fourth place with two points each.         
	Debutant Lenier Dominguez of Cuba stands sole sixth on 1.5 points while Teiumour Radjabov of Azerbaijan and Wang Yue of China are at the bottom with just one point each.         
	For Anand, this has been an excellent event barring the disaster he suffered at the hands of Aronian in round two.         
	With an opening round victory over Radjabov and fourth round triumph over Wang Yue, Anand has already send warning signals to his competitors here. He may be half a point behind Aronian and Grischuk but its a long tournament and only the form in the second half will determine how the players finish in the Euro 314000 prize money event.

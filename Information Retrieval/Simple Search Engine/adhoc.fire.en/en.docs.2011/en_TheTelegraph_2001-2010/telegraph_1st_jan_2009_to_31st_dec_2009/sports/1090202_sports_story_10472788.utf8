	Liverpool: Fernando Torres scored two late goals to give Liverpool a 2-0 victory over 10-man Chelsea on Sunday that kept the Reds firmly in the race for the Premier League title.         
	As a fourth successive league draw loomed, Torres met Fabio Aurelios cross with a glancing header at the near post in the 89th minute.         
	The Spain striker added his second goal in stoppage time, calmly slotting past Petr Cech after Yossi Benayoun was tackled by Chelsea defender Ashley Cole.         
	The last-gasp win allowed the Reds to leapfrog the visitors and take second place in the standings  two points behind Manchester United, who have a game in hand.         
	After a first half that produced little to excite the 44,174 fans, the match came to life after the hour-mark when Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard was dismissed for a sliding challenge on Xabi Alonso.         
	The pre-match intrigue centred on who was and  more significantly  who wasnt at Anfield.         
	While the feud between co-owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett Jr. isnt as acrimonious as it was a year ago, their lingering divisions were clear for fans to see as they sat more than a dozen seats apart in the directors box.         
	High on the agenda, though, on their first joint visit to the stadium in more than a year is the future of manager Rafa Benitez, who is hoping to agree a new contract, and also of striker Robbie Keane.         
	Keane was left out of the squad for the second consecutive weekend by Benitez, although he made a six-minute cameo appearance in a midweek draw at Wigan. The decision raises the possibility of a return to Tottenham for the Irish forward after six months at Liverpool.         
	As snow swirled around the pitch, Alonso, who Benitez tried to offload before the season started, was the first to test the visitors with a fierce strike from 20 metres that Petr Cech tipped away in the 10th minute.         
	No red shirts were lurking when Cech spilled Javier Mascheranos 20th-minute effort and there was another erratic moment from the Czech goalkeeper soon afterwards when he sliced a clearance, almost allowing Torres to pounce.         
	Cole nearly bundled the ball into his own goal after an Alberto Riera strike was parried, while Cechs crossbar was rattled in the 68th when defender Alex deflected Alonsos shot.         
	With Chelsea yet to provide any danger for Pepe Reina, manager Luiz Felipe Scolari deployed Deco for Malouda and Didier Drogba for Anelka.         
	Benayoun, who replaced Riera, unleashed a curling shot that Cech palmed wide with a diving save, and followed up with a volley that flew over the bar.         
	Earlier, Shola Ameobis second-half penalty earned Newcastle United a 1-1 draw against bitter rivals Sunderland at St James Park on Sunday, a result that left both clubs mired in relegation trouble.

                                                     India have a slight edge over other teams: Greg
                  Former India coach Greg Chappell                     
	New Delhi: Mahendra Singh Dhonis brilliant captaincy and Yuvraj Singhs aggression make defending champions India the strongest contenders to lift the World Twenty20 title in England, feels former India coach and Australia captain Greg Chappell.         
	It is very hard to predict who will win the trophy. But I think India are the strongest contenders to retain the title. Pakistan are unpredictable and Australia, too, have improved a lot in this format. It will be quite open this time, Chappell said from Brisbane.         
	India have slight edge over other teams. They have trump cards like Dhoni and Yuvraj. Dhoni is among the best captains today.         
	Yuvraj was out of colour in the Indian Premier League (IPL), but according to me, he is one of the most dangerous batsmen in the shortest form of cricket. He will give headaches to rival captains, opined Chappell.         
	Yuvraj smashed six sixes in an over off English pacer Stuart Broad in the inaugural T20 World Cup in South Africa two years ago.         
	Chappell said the IPL experience will be an added advantage for Indian players. Indian players are very well prepared after the IPL. But I dont think that performance of players like Yuvraj and Dhoni, who have performed in patches during IPL, will get affected by this so called lean patch.         
	Chappell was equally impressed with the performance of retired stars like Adam Gilchrist, Shane Warne, Matthew Hayden and Anil Kumble.         
	A talented player can play any form of the game. Seniors have proved that they still have it in them. They had to move on in their careers and everyone has to call it a day. One cannot play forever... But I think we will miss players like Gilchrist in the T20 World Cup, Chappell said.         
	Chappell was appointed the India coach in 2005, but a series of controversies and Indias poor show in the 2007 ODI World Cup led to his resignation. Senior players performance was appreciable, but Chappell maintained that T20 format is meant for youngsters.         
	I think this format is for young and energetic players who have hunger to prove themselves, he said.         
	Asked about the leadership skills of Gilchrist, who led last years bottom-placed Deccan Chargers to the IPL title this year, Chappell said he is not at all that surprised with the Aussies feat.         
	I always knew that he is a very clever captain. He has the courage and conviction. It does not surprise me that his team won the title and he was adjuged the Man of the Series.         
	Chappell also praised Rajasthan Royals captain and coach Shane Warne and admitted that Australia missed a clever captain. It is hard luck for him that he could not be the national captain, Chappell remarked.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India will have to play Russian roulette
                                                     India will have to play Russian roulette
            OUR CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES            Somdev Dev Varman                           
	New Delhi/Mumbai: India were on Wednesday handed a tough Davis Cup draw and will take on the fourth seeds and former champions Russia in an away first-round tie scheduled for March 5-7 while Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal could face each other in the first round after Spain drew Switzerland.         
	India made the World Group after 11 years with a convincing 4-1 win over South Africa on Sunday while Russia lost by the same margin to Israel in the World Group quarterfinal.         
	Indias main hope Somdev Dev Varman said: Its going to be a daunting task for us. Having said that, I feel in Davis Cup everyone has a chance and we will have to prepare really well.         
	We will all have to play our best tennis if we have to beat the likes of (Nikolay) Davydenko, (Mikhail) Youzhny and (Igor) Andreev in their own backyard.         
	Non-playing captain S.P. Misra admitted that the draw, made at Geneva, Switzerland, is tough.         
	It will be tough. I have heard that its freezing cold at that time there and they will play us on clay in an indoor court. That surface does not suit us. But we have five months to prepare, we will take care of all these things, Misra said.         
	Misra said they were hoping for a home tie but luck did not favour them.         
	We have played two away ties  against Chinese Taipei and South Africa. We were hoping for a home tie but we cant do much. Its okay, he said.         
	Last time India competed in the World Group was in 1998 when they lost to Italy. India have thrice made the final of Davis Cup but have never won the title.         
	Federer and Nadal, the worlds top two players and known for their fierce rivalry, have never met in the Davis Cup.         
	We have to accept how the draw is. Well try to beat them in Spain, Switzerland captain Severin Luthi said.         
	For sure thats one of the toughest draws we can have.         
	Federer has often opted to skip playing for his country in the Davis Cup, but he earned two points for the team over the weekend when Switzerland beat Italy 3-2 in the playoffs to remain in the top-tier World Group.         
	Its too early to say if Roger will play or not, Luthi said.         
	Spain, who won the title last year, will face the Czech Republic on December 4-6 in this years final. Spain beat Israel 4-1 last weekend in the semi-final, but Nadal missed the series because of injury. He also missed last years final win over Argentina because of injury.         
	Federer and Nadal have met in seven Grand Slam finals, with Nadal winning five. Until his loss to Juan Martin del Potro in this years US Open final, Federer had been undefeated in major finals against anyone other than Nadal.         
	The draw for the World Group will also send the United States to Serbia, making a match between Novak Djokovic and Andy Roddick a possibility for the best-of-five series from March 5-7.         
	Its certainly a huge match, and certainly Djokovic, playing in his home country, will be tough, United States Tennis Association coach and former Davis Cup captain Tom Gullikson said.         
	But Roddick actually had some very good success against him this year and hopefully thatll continue into the first round of Davis Cup next year.         
	The other first-round match-ups: Belgium vs Czech Republic; Germany vs France; Argentina vs Sweden; Ecuador vs Croatia; Chile vs Israel.

                                                     Wasim Akram enters the frame
    - Former Pak captain, John Wright only prominent candidates left to be interviewed             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Wasim Akram                                 
	Calcutta: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram, inarguably the most gifted left-arm quick of all time, is in the frame to take John Buchanans place in the Kolkata Knight Riders set-up.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Akram and John Wright, who has captained New Zealand and coached India, are the only prominent candidates left to be interviewed by principal owner Shah Rukh Khan and his team.         
	One expects this process, which includes a presentation by the hopefuls, to be completed by the end of this week.         
	Till the other day, Wright (55) was the frontrunner to succeed Buchanan, whod been the franchises head of cricket operations until his sacking two months ago. However, impressive presentations by Richard Pybus and Duncan Fletcher have opened up the race somewhat.         
	Akrams presence has, of course, made it all the more intriguing as the 43-year-old has the potential to do an Usain Bolt.         
	Clearly, Akram has the advantage of stature and age, besides being one from the region. Bonding in the dressing room, therefore, wont be an issue.         
	Six years ago, in fact, Akram had been the then India captain Sourav Gangulys choice No.1 to wear the bowling coachs hat. Eventually, Bruce Reid stepped into that position, albeit for a brief period.         
	The Akram-Sourav connection is significant as the latter is set to be reinstated as the Knights captain and is on the franchises interview panel.         
	One hitch, though, could be Akrams nationality.         
	After all, at this point in time, theres no guarantee that Pakistanis would be allowed to play a role in the IPLs third edition, 2010.         
	So far, however, Akram hasnt faced problems during his visits to India for promotionals. Hes quite a regular in New Delhi.         
	Meanwhile, Matthew Mott (hand-picked by Buchanan) is among those already interviewed. Mott was the assistant coach in edition No.1 and had been promoted this year, before the second edition.         
	He got a chance as Shah Rukh wanted to be fair There was no other reason to call him from Australia, one of the sources said, on Monday.         
	The Knights promoted Mott, but the franchise actually did worse than in 2008  finishing last, a drop of two places in an eight-team competition.         
	Quite a few Indians have been interviewed, but indications are that a desi coach wont get to play anything more than a supporting hand.         
	That may change, but few would today be willing to bet on it.

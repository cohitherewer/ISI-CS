The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Davydenko sets up Nadal date
                                                   Davydenko sets up Nadal date
                      
	Barcelona: Third-seeded Nikolay Davydenko rallied for a 6-7 (7-4), 6-2, 6-2 victory over Radek Stepanek on Friday to reach the Barcelona Open semi-finals where he will meet the top-ranked Rafael Nadal.         
	In other quarter final matches of the day, fourth-seeded David Ferrer of Spain eased past compatriot Tommy Robredo 6-3, 6-4 while fifth-seeded Chilean Fernando Gonzalez had a tough match before edging past Fernando Verdasco 6-3, 4-6, 6-4.         
	Davydenko recovered from early mistakes in the first set, but wasted three set points as Stepanek used crafty net play to frustrate his opponent and force the tiebreaker. The Czech player hit one of his seven aces to secure the first set.         
	But Stepanek then crumbled behind a slew of unforced errors, and Davydenko broke to take a 3-2 lead and then used another break to clinch the second set.         
	Davydenko used strong returns to break twice more in the third set to pocket the match.         
	Davydenko does not rate his chances of advancing too highly against a top seed riding a 23-match victory run on clay.         
	Say the odds are 100 per cent for Rafa, the Russian joked when pressed to predict how he would fare against the winner of the last four editions at the Real club.         
	You never know about tomorrow, but Im not going worry about it now. Im going to relax and enjoy my life.         
	The Barcelona week is only his second back on a regular schedule and his progress is rapid after a Monte Carlo quarter final last week.         
	Im very happy with my results, said the challenger ranked eighth. Im playing some good tennis now, but I dont think Im ready for a Grand Slam  at least not yet.         
	But playing Rafa will give me a good idea of where my game is now.         
	Nadal leads Davydenko 3-2, winning both of their meetings on clay. But the Russian came up victorious in their last match in the quarter finals of Paris Bercy last autumn when the Spaniard quit with knee pain trailing 6-1.         
	After missing several months of play, including the Australian Open due to a heel injury, Davydenko is easing back into competition.         
	Nadal, who has a 3-2 record against Davydenko and 2-0 on clay, reached the semi-finals without having to play Friday, after his quarter final opponent David Nalbandian withdrew on Thursday with a right hip injury.         
	The Spaniard is vying to follow up his fifth straight Monte Carlo Masters trophy with a fifth straight title at Barcelona. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Valencia tear Real apart
                                                   Valencia tear Real apart
                      
	Madrid: Real Madrids 2-6 defeat against Barcelona last weekend looked to have taken a heavy toll as Valencia trounced the Madrid giants 3-0 in a Spanish League match on Saturday.         
	The hosts scored twice in three first-half minutes through Juan Mata and David Silva, with Ruben Baraja adding a stunning third after the break.         
	Earlier, third-placed Sevilla were inspired to a 3-1 home win over Real Mallorca by Luis Fabiano.         
	That moved them on to 63 points and kept them four ahead of chasing Valencia in the race for the Champions League qualification places.         
	Real keeper Iker Casillas pulled off a magnificent early save at the Mestalla with his team on the back foot, but he was beaten in the 29th minute when Valencias attacking trio of Silva, Mata and David Villa combined for a slick opener. Mata put away Villas lay-off, and soon after Silva cut in off the left flank and fired in from distance only for Casillas to weakly push the ball inside his near post.         
	The visitors were helpless in the face of Valencias quick, incisive attacks and after 68 minutes midfielder Baraja rubbed salt in the wound with a spectacular volley from outside the area.         
	At the Sanchez Pizjuan, Aritz Aduriz had given Mallorca an early lead before Sevillas Brazil striker Fabiano was brought down for a penalty as he surged into the area.         
	Frederic Kanoutes dummy sent the keeper the wrong way from the spot, before Fabiano spun away from his marker in midfield and burst away from three defenders to net Sevillas second on the hour mark. Jesus Navas jinked in off the right wing to seal the win with a fierce drive into the far top corner.         
	Athletic Bilbao secured their top-flight future with a 1-0 home win over Real Betis.

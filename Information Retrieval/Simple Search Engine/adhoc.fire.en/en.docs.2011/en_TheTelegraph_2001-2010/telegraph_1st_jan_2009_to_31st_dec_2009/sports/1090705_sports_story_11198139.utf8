            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The CABs cricket committee is set to fine Ashok Dinda for his spat with Ranadeb Bose during the Vijay Hazare Trophy in Agartala in March. The committee will announce its decision on Monday.         
	Besides the fine, Dinda will also be severely reprimanded and warned for his behaviour.         
	There is no point in suspending the youngster because the season is already over. What is the point of dragging the punishment into another season? a committee member said on Saturday.         
	Moreover why should we deprive a talented youngster by suspending him for a few matches There should be some logic behind the decision, he added.         
	Meanwhile, it will be a fight between Manoj Tiwary and Wriddhiman Saha for the seasons best cricketers award.

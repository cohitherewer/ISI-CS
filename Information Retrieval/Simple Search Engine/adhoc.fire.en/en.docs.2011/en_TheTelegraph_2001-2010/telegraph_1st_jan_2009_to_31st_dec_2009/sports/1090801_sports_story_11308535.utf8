	Birmingham: England fast bowlers James Anderson and Graham Onions ripped out Australia for 263 on the second day of the third Ashes Test on Friday.         
	England had reached 116 for two in reply when bad light ended play more than an hour early with captain Andrew Strauss on 64 and Ian Bell on 26.         
	England, 1-0 up in the series and seeking to build a healthy first-innings lead, took inspiration from outstanding seam bowling from Anderson and Onions who took seven wickets in the morning session.         
	Onions struck with the first two balls of the day to dismiss Shane Watson and Michael Hussey and he also removed Australia captain Ricky Ponting in the same spell.         
	Anderson sent back Michael Clarke, Marcus North, Mitchell Johnson and Graham Manou in quick succession just before lunch.         
	The England pace attack had struggled on the rain-disrupted first day but Onions settled quickly into his rhythm after Australia resumed on 126 for one.         
	He trapped Watson lbw for 62 and bowled Hussey when the left-hander misjudged the line and offered no stroke.         
	Ponting became Australias highest Test run-scorer when he reached 25 but added only 13 more before edging a catch to wicket-keeper Matt Prior as he attempted an ambitious hook.         
	Michael Clarke was badly dropped by Andrew Flintoff at second slip but he had made only 29 when he missed an inswinger from Anderson and was adjudged lbw.         
	North drove loosely at a wide ball from Anderson and was brilliantly caught one-handed by the diving Prior for 12, Johnson was trapped lbw by Anderson first ball and Graham Manou was bowled by a perfect outswinger.         
	Australias last two wickets added 60 useful runs.         
	Peter Siddle was caught by Prior off Anderson for 13 and Ben Hilfenhaus caught by Graeme Swann in the gully off Onions for 20, leaving Nathan Hauritz unbeaten on 20.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Houghton request to clubs
                                                   Houghton request to clubs
                      
	New Delhi: India football coach Bob Houghton has urged I-League clubs to make the Goal 2011 project a success and help build a strong national team for the Asian Cup in Qatar in two years time.         
	The Englishman has chalked up an ambitious plan in the run-up to the 2011 Asian Cup and implementing it would require close to Rs 40 crore.         
	Houghton feels the I-League clubs need to come forward for the project to see the light of day. Clubs should help the AIFF in starting this project, he said.         
	Houghton is aware luring away star players from the clubs could see a decline in television coverage for important tournaments like the Federation Cup and the I-League.         
	There are a whole lot of issues that still needs to be discussed, he said.           (PTI)

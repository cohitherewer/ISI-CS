            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Manoj Tiwary                           
	Calcutta/Cuttack: Wriddhiman Saha and Nataraj Behera will open for East Zone when they face North in their opening group A match of the Deodhar Trophy at Barabati Stadium on Saturday.         
	East have decided to go in with a three-pronged pace attack  Assams Dhiraj Goswami will play alongside the Bengal duo of Ranadeb Bose and Ashok Dinda. Tripuras left-arm spinner Tushar Saha along with Orissa off-spinner Rakesh Mohanty will complete the bowling line-up.         
	North Zone, who won their first match by seven wickets on Friday, will be high on confidence.         
	East captain Manoj Tiwary, however, is not reading much into it. Our team has got great potential. The boys are determined and raring to go. The only thing we need to do tomorrow is to execute things according to our plans. I have seen the determination on the boys faces. I believe we can do it, a confident Tiwary said.         
	Ishank Jaggi is likely to bat at No.3 while Tiwary will follow at No.4. Saurabh Tiwary, Deepak Sharma will bat next.         
	They (North) are a very good side. No matter whether they have won or not, North are always tough opponents. I have spoken to the boys individually. They have promised me to give off their best, Tiwary said.         
	The difference between each side playing here is minimum Any team that plays according to their strengths and stick to a plan will have the upper hand. We also have similar plans.         
	With 11 titles in the zonal tournament, North Zone have already said they will be playing for pride. Friday they showed their grit and determination, coming up with a solid batting display with openers Aakash Chopra and Rohit Dewan giving them a flying start. It was just a formality after that as Kohli, captain Mithun Minhas and Rajat Bhatia combined to thrash defending champions Central with 2.1 overs to spare.         
	We had won this tournament two seasons ago when I was the captain... We hope to do the same again, Minhas remarked.         
	Minhas said the win against the defending champions was obviously a strong confidence booster and they were looking forward to take on East. They are the local side and we cant afford to relax, he said.         
	Meanwhile, in a group B match at Ravenshaw University Ground on Saturday, South Zone will lock horns with Zimbabwe Board Presidents XI.         
	It will be a do-or-die match for South Zone against the Zimbabwean side. Led by Prosper Utseya, the visitors, who have come here with a 5-0 win over Kenya to their credit, may just produce some surprise in the end.

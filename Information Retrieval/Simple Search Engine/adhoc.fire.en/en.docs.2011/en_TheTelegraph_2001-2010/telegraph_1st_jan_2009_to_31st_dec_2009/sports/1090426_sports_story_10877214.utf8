                                                   Tall order for Challengers
                      
	Port Elizabeth: The Delhi DareDevils, buoyed with confidence after two successive victories, will strive to continue with the winning momentum while a struggling Royal Challengers Bangalore will try to recapture their lost sheen when the two teams lock horns in an Indian Premier League encounter here on Sunday.         
	The Delhi team, by virtue of their back-to-back wins against the Kings XI Punjab and last years runner-up the Chennai Super Kings, are comfortably placed second in the points tally.         
	In contrast, the Vijay Mallya-owned Bangalore team are languishing at the seventh spot in the tally after losing three encounters on the trot.         
	The Delhi side will surely count upon their formidable batting line-up with captain Virender Sehwag joining his Team India opening partner Gautam Gambhir at the top, followed by South African AB de Villers.         
	Pietersen, who was made the captain of the Challengers after being bought for a whopping $1.5 million, is surely under pressure and would try to prove that their first-match win was not a fluke.

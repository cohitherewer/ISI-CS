                                                   Mark wins 10th stage
                      
	Issoudun (France): Mark Cavendish won the 10th stage of the Tour de France on Tuesday, narrowly beating Thor Hushovd in a sprint finish on a flat stage that had cyclists riding without earpieces.         
	The British sprinter earned his third stage win of the Tour by breaking ahead in the final 200 metres and holding off a late charge from Hushovd. Tyler Farrar of the United States finished third.         
	It was a really hard finish, slightly uphill with a lot of corners, said Cavendish, who rides for Team Columbia-High Road. (AFP)

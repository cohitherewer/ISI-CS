                                                     Lee: Ashes preparation the best Ive ever had
                  Brett Lee                     
	Melbourne: He might be under pressure to regain his place in the Australian team for the upcoming Ashes series but pacer Brett Lee insists he is at the peak of his fitness and is feeling stronger than ever.         
	Lee was criticised by former cricketer Geoff Lawson, who termed him countrys last-choice bowler, who will prove a liability in Australias bid to avenge their 2005 Ashes loss in England.         
	My preparation before this tour has been outstanding. Its probably the best preparation Ive ever had, Lee was quoted as saying in an Australian daily.         
	That all came through getting injured and having 17 weeks to get my strength back up at home. Im at a stage in my life, at 32, I feel Im definitely the strongest Ive ever been and I feel fit, he added.         
	A game against Sussex, and the July 1-4 trial against England Lions would decide his place in the Ashes side and Lee said he has kept a plan B for himself if he doesnt get selected in the playing XI.         
	So I give myself every opportunity and if it happens, it happens. If it doesnt Ill work on plan B.         
	Youve always got a second plan in place but Im not planning to work on plan B at the moment. Ive done the hard work and if I get the opportunity then the hard work will pay off.         
	Lee also believes in competition and said it was a healthy sign for Australia to have so many pacers fighting for a place in the team.         
	I know youve got to perform as a player, Lee said. If youre not doing the business then youre not going to get the nod. I understand that. I understand too, that if I put too much pressure on myself then Im less likely to play the style of cricket I want to play.         
	Its that fine line, it all comes down to me and whether Im comfortable and Im happy with the way that Im training.         
	If Australian stocks, as far as bowling goes, are nice and healthy, and there are five or six guys who can get an opportunity, its only going to improve us as a team.         
	We do realise that only 11 players can play so there are going to be some guys who miss out which is, unfortunately, what happens as part of a touring side.         
	Lee said he has seen enough life to know how to deal with its ups and downs. Ive been on both sides of the fence. I was 12th man in India for four Tests and close to 18 months. So I know what it feels like. (PTI)

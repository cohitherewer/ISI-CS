            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Fidel Edwardss injury is being assessed on a daily basis                           
	London: Chris Gayle, the West Indies captain, expects the Indians to come hard at his team during the forthcoming four-match ODI series at home.         
	The matches will be played between June 26-July 5.         
	We beat India here (in the World T20), but its never easy defeating them... I expect them to bounce back and come hard at us, Gayle said.         
	Meanwhile, the injury to spearhead Fidel Edwards is being assessed on a daily basis.         
	Right now, we dont know when hell be fit... His injury continues to be assessed on a daily basis, a member of the West Indies team management told The Telegraph on Friday evening.         
	Edwards has been having pain at the root of a nerve in the lower back region. It began when he was warming up for the West Indies last Super Eight match, against England.         
	Gayle and Co. won that must-win one and qualified for the World T20 semi-finals.

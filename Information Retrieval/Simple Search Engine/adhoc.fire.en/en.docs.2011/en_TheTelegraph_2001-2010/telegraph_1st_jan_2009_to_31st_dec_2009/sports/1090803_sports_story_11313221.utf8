The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Desire to lead NZ did it: McCullum
                                                     Desire to lead NZ did it: McCullum
                  Brendon McCullum                     
	Christchurch: Brendon McCullums ambition to lead New Zealand in future was the reason why he agreed to forego the Indian Premier League (IPL)s financial windfall next year and sign New Zealand Cricket (NZC)s central contract despite not getting any compensation for it.         
	McCullum said he did not want signing for the IPL to be counted against him when the selectors sit down to pick incumbent Daniel Vettoris successor.         
	I would have hoped it wouldnt count against me, McCullum said. But yes, I want to captain New Zealand at some point in time. Id dearly love that honour. Its an ambition of mine and I think the time will come when Im good and ready.         
	McCullum and several other New Zealand cricketers signed their central contracts despite a clash between the IPL and their international commitments.         
	The New Zealand wicketkeeper admitted that the decision to forego close to $500,000 for a months work was not easy. Im not going to lie, it was tough. The cold, hard facts are there for anyone to see, he said.         
	It wasnt that I didnt want to play cricket for New Zealand, but I guess the immediate financial security that sort of money can provide for your family was a factor, he added.         
	McCullum, who captained the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) this season, said despite the initial unease, he is now happy with the decision he has taken.         
	It was difficult, knowing how much money I was turning down, and I also had to think about the captaincy at KKR. I would have liked to have the opportunity to turn around what happened earlier this year after our disappointing tournament.         
	I was pretty determined to be there and try and turn that around, but unfortunately, it wasnt to be. In the end, I feel very comfortable with the decision I made, and I feel that it was the right one to make, he said.         
	McCullums teammate all-rounder Jacob Oram also admitted that it was tough to decide on the matter. You cannot begrudge us the time to think about it and discuss with our wives, families, mentors, Oram said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Asif puts blame on eye drop
                                                   Asif puts blame on eye drop
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Karachi: The drug tribunal of the Indian Premier League (IPL) Saturday completed its hearing in Mumbai but reserved the verdict on Pakistani pacer Mohammed Asif who blamed an eye drop, containing nandrolone, for failing a dope test last year.         
	In a statement, Asif claimed both the medical experts from his defence counsel and the prosecution agreed that he had taken Keratyl, an eye drop containing nandrolone, and this was the reason for his testing positive.         
	Although the minimum sentence for using a banned substance is two years under Wada rules, but since Asif used by mistake an eye drop containing nandrolone, the tribunal has decided to take a few days before giving its verdict on the case, the statement said.         
	No decision has been taken on him and the tribunal will meet again, Shirish Gupte, a tribunal member, said after the hearing.         
	The IPL drugs tribunal has reserved its verdict in the interim and shall now meet again soon to take a final decision on the matter, according to a statement.         
	Asif appeared before the tribunal accompanied by his team of professionals, including his legal counsels from Pakistan and India, and a medical expert from England.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhutia sends letter to IFA
                                                   Bhutia sends letter to IFA
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutia has sent a nine-page letter to the Indian Football Association (IFA) Friday seeking its intervention in the suspension slapped by Mohun Bagan.         
	It was also learnt that the Indian captain has asked for a no objection certificate so that he can play for another club next season without any hindrance .         
	Bhaichung has challenged Mohun Bagans suspension order, Bhutias counsel Usha Nath Banerjee said on Friday evening.         
	According to Banerjee, the letter has stated the regulation 22A(a) of the constitution of IFA which expressly demands that, to suspend a player, the club is required to first initiate a disciplinary proceeding and thereafter give reasonable opportunity of hearing to the concerned player.         
	The fact remains that none of these were complied with by Mohun Bagan prior to suspending Bhutia. Now the governing body of the IFA is required to immediately take up the reference and decide whether the suspension could be sustained or set aside, said Banerjee. In addition to the above, Bhutia has raised other serious questions challenging the validity of his contract with Mohun Bagan and demanded immediate release.         
	IFA secretary Utpal Ganguli said he was not aware of the letters content.

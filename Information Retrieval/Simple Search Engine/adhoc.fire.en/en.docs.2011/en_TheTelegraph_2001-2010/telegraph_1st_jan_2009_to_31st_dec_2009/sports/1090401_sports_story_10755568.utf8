  - SHAH RUKH KHAN STEPS IN TO MINIMISE DAMAGE CAUSED TO KNIGHT RIDERS IMAGE       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: In a bid to minimise the damage caused to his propertys image over the past week, principal owner Shah Rukh Khan has vetoed cricket manager John Buchanans concept of multiple captains for the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	Taken aback by the outrage/ criticism in many quarters, over the move which would wholly hurt team icon Sourav Ganguly, Shah Rukh is also considering retaining him at the helm.         
	Shah Rukh didnt, of course, even hint at that in the statement issued by him after a meeting with Sourav and Buchanan at his Mumbai residence, Mannat, on Tuesday afternoon. They were together for over three hours.         
	However, according to The Telegraphs sources, that could have been a tactical step, aimed at not offending Buchanan, who in any case is unlikely to quickly swallow the embarrassment of a controversial concept being shot down.         
	Shah Rukh, perhaps, needs time to work things out with Buchanan. Initially, though, the principal owner had (in principle) been comfortable with Buchanans concept.         
	But, then, the backlash hadnt exactly been budgeted for.         
	Confirming that somewhat, somebody with the Knight Riders said: Two major issues remain  whether we should have a full-time captain and, if yes, whether Sourav should be retained in that position The damage has to be minimal         
	Given that the team essentially is a business, it doesnt make good business sense to belittle the regions No.1 hero.         
	The gentleman added that irrespective of who is at the helm, there would still be multiple leaders on the park. Only, they wont be designated as fielding/bowling captains, but be called strategists.         
	A change, certainly, from the traditional way of leading a cricket team. Buchanan, therefore, neednt feel all has been lost.         
	For the record, Shah Rukhs statement included the following: We will take the call on the issue of captain, vice-captain, the team, post the (preparatory) sessions in South Africa, prior to the first game         
	Sourav and Buchanan, by the way, were the only invitees to Mannat. The former left first, as he wanted to be back home the same day, while Buchanan stayed back for an hour at least.         
	Buchanan and 15 others leave for Johannesburg/Bloemfontein, via Dubai, on Wednesday. The remaining players from India should depart by Sunday.         
	The IPLs second edition gets underway on April 18, with the Knight Riders first match (in Cape Town, against Deccan Chargers) a day later.

                                                     India to test bench in dress rehearsal
    - Nehru cup AIFF wakes up late, declares hosts are already in final             JAYDEEP BASU            Rennedy Singh is likely to lead                                 
	New Delhi: India coach Bob Houghton has decided to test his bench strength against Syria on Saturday after the All India Football Federation (AIFF) woke up from its slumber a day late, on Friday, announcing Indias entry into the final of the ONGC-Nehru Cup.         
	Like the AIFF, the Indian team management was also in the dark about the fact that the team had already made it to the title round as per the tournament rules.         
	We werent aware of it, said Houghton. Gagan (Kapoor), our physio, was the first to know about it. He told all of us.         
	Till Thursday, perhaps the AIFF officials themselves were ignorant of the rules and were under the impression that the goal difference of the teams would be taken into account to decide the rank of the teams in the five-team round robin.         
	On Friday morning, the federation issued a press release, saying in case two teams have the same number of points, the result of the match played between those two teams in the league would be considered to decide their rank.         
	 The release clearly said that even if Sri Lanka defeated Kyrgyzstan to be on six points, the same as India, the hosts would make the final as they had beaten the Lankans 3-1 in the group match.         
	Though a few eyebrows were raised suspecting it was an attempt to favour the hosts, the tournament rules were in accordance with the AFC Champions League, AFC Cup and the Asian Cup. The Uefa also has similar rules for its tournaments.         
	The Indian coach, however, wasnt too bothered about getting the news late and said he would test some of the substitutes against Syria on Saturday, 48 hours before the two teams again play in the final.         
	According to Houghton, while Deepak Mondal would come in for Surkumar Singh in the defence, the other regular defenders, including goalkeeper Subroto Paul, would be fielded for the match.         
	In the midfield and forwardline, Houghton is going to make sweeping changes. Rennedy Singh, Mehrajuddin Wadoo and Syed Rahim Nabi would be in the starting eleven.         
	The fourth place in the midfield will be filled up by Climax Lawrence and NP Pradeep, who will play one half each.         
	Both Bhaichung Bhutia and Sunil Chetri have been rested. Their places will be taken by Abhishek Yadav and Sushil Singh. In Bhutias absence, Rennedy is likely to lead the team.         
	We arent taking the match lightly, said Houghton. We have got a chance to play our other players. They are equally good. I think the match will be interesting.         
	The Indian coach was of the opinion that the present Syrian team was better than the one that played against India in the final two years ago at the same venue. In 2007, India lost the group league match 2-3 in a thrilling encounter. In the final, however, India hit back to beat the Syrians by a Pradeep goal.         
	The Syrian team management has been complaining about the absence of some key players in the team from the start of the tournament. The team has come with only 17 footballers.         
	While the Indian coach spoke to the media, the footballers were swarmed by fans at a south Delhi school ground where the team had a practice session for little more than an hour. Bhutia, of course, was the star attraction though other players too were besieged by the autograph seekers.         
	We are like a happy family now, said team manager, Pradeep Chowdhury.         
	 We were bit upset after losing to Lebanon in the first match but the boys have made a good comeback. The team is now hungry to win the Nehru Cup once again.

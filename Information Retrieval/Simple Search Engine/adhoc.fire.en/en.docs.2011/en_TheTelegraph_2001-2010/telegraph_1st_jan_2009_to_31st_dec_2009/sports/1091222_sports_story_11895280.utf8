The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cops find Eden   far from ready
                                                                                                                       7                                      Cops find Eden   far from ready
            OUR BUREAU      Eighth Column                            
	Calcutta: Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti Monday expressed his displeasure, although not publicly, at the arrangements at Eden Gardens for Thursdays ODI between India and Sri Lanka and asked the authorities concerned to get their act together.         
	Chakrabarti also pulled up some of his colleagues in the force for their failure to ensure things were in order.         
	The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) officials, however, were confident they would have everything in place when the teams landed in the city.         
	During a trip around the stadium to oversee the arrangements, Chakrabarti pointed out how the two sides of the Dr BC Roy Clubhouse, that had been left open after the demolition of the BC and LK blocks, posed a security threat for the players and the VIPs alike.         
	He asked officials and the senior police personnel accompanying him to take immediate steps to ensure that the empty space along the demarcation walls on either side of the clubhouse were covered up immediately.         
	The teams would be arriving in their respective buses, which will come right on to the field from one of the open ends, and then proceed to the dressing rooms. We dont want to take chances with so much open space around, Chakrabarti told the CAB officials, led by Chitrak Mitra, in charge of overseeing stadium preparations.         
	CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey was confident things would be ready on time. Everything will be sorted out, Dey said. We are working overtime. We had a discussion with the police and are confident of putting things in place.         
	Earlier, Chakrabarti took a ride on a police jeep through one of the dismantled gates on L block to determine whether the ground was ready for team buses to enter through it and right into the stadium.         
	He got off on a stretch of ground that was still being readied. The work of levelling the land was on and, at some places, iron-rods jutted out, much to the displeasure of the cops who called for an immediate restoration before the buses carrying the players rolled in through this point on December 23 for the practise session.         
	What irked the cops was that with barely 48-hours to go before the players arrived, even the makeshift screens, meant to prevent outsiders from taking a peek into the ground from the dismantled ends, were not in place. The temporary walls, too, are yet to come up.         
	We have asked the CAB to complete some of the work. There would be inspections on Tuesday and I will drop in again for the final check, on December 23, Chakrabarti said.         
	Although the police chief didnt want to be too critical of the progress so far, he did make it clear that the manner in which the soil had been heaped behind some of the blocks was not to his liking.         
	It was also discovered that some manhole covers inside the stadium had been left open.         
	Chakrabarti said that the ticketing code was not to his satisfaction as the passes for the different gates were not separated by colour codes.         
	We hope that this problem with tickets is taken care of for future matches, including the IPL, Chakrabarti said.         
	The Eden, which seats 83,635, would be able to use only 53 per cent of its capacity since four galleries are being renovated as part of the preparations for the 2010 World Cup.         
	The authorities are not selling any priced tickets for the December 24 match.         
	Out of the 44, 702 seats thus available, the CAB will distribute free tickets to 32, 736 members and 8, 667 among the affiliated clubs, districts and universities. VIPs, who will occupy the clubhouse, have 3,300 tickets earmarked for them.

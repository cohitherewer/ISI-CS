The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ricky wants to make amends
                                                     Ricky wants to make amends
                  Ricky Ponting                     
	Coolum: Australia captain Ricky Ponting leaned back in his chair and smiled slightly when asked what could have been a slightly embarrassing question: what did he think of his Twenty20 form?         
	I think youd probably be better off asking someone else that question, Ponting said, and with good reason. The past couple of games Ive played have been very poor. In the two games in South Africa, I made 1 in each. Its not great form going into a World Cup.         
	In fact, Pontings best score in his last four matches of the super-shortened game is 38. Already a proven performer in Test and limited-overs Internationals, the 34-year-old Ponting sounded less confident of hitting form at the World Twenty20, which starts Friday at Lords.         
	Ponting will play his 16th Twenty20 International when he leads Australia in its tournament opener against the West Indies on Saturday.         
	And he knows the vagaries of the Twenty20 game dont always suit his talent. Batting where I do in the top order of Twenty20 cricket, it can sometimes be a bit difficult, Ponting said. Obviously, the earlier you get in the better chance youve got of making a big score, but youre expected to play in a certain way. Top-order batsmen are always going to have their ups and downs in that sort of game.         
	Other players in addition to Ponting in Australias squad who have also been selected for the following Ashes series are vice-captain Michael Clarke, batsman Mike Hussey, wicketkeeper Brad Haddin, fast bowlers Peter Siddle, Brett Lee, Ben Hilfenhaus and Mitchell Johnson, injury-prone allrounder Shane Watson and offspinner Nathan Hauritz.         
	Lee hasnt bowled for Australia since operations on his foot and ankle in December. Watson played as a batsman in Australias five limited-overs Internationals against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, but has not bowled since last November because of stress fractures in his back and a groin injury.         
	Australias squad has considerable bowling depth with the inclusion of Johnson and Siddle, who were rested from the recent series against Pakistan, Nathan Bracken, James Hopes and Hauritz.         
	Ponting was also rested from the ODI series against Pakistan after a hectic five months. Allrounders Andrew Symonds and Cameron White are also part of the squad.           (AP)

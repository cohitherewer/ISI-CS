The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tax police tweak Diego ears
                                                   Tax police tweak Diego ears
                      
	Rome: Italian tax police visited Diego Maradona at an exclusive Alpine resort and took away a pair of the Argentina coachs earrings as part payment for the former Napoli stars unpaid taxes.         
	The command office of the Bolzano Provincial Tax Police said Maradona himself handed over the earrings, worth $5,900.         
	The tax police in the capital of the South Tyrol, or Alto Adige region, declined to describe the earrings they took away from the Grand Hotel Palace in Merano, which boasts an exclusive beauty farm in its grounds. An Italian television network reported that they had diamonds.         
	Police did not say if Maradona was wearing them when the tax police came calling. Its not the first time the football great has surrendered some of his jewellery when visiting Italy.         
	Three years ago, tax police took two Rolex watches from him when he went to a Naples suburb. Italian news agency ANSA said the tax bill now stands at more than $54 million.         
	Bolzano police said Maradona is a regular at the Alpine regions resorts. (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhaichung amp; Co. held by third division XI
                                                     Bhaichung amp; Co. held by third division XI
            ANSHUMAN ROY    
	Barcelona: The 20 minute drive on Saturday through the beautiful Catalan countryside led to the Gava Stadium Complex where the Indian team were playing the first match of their Spanish sojourn against UE Castelldefels.         
	The picturesque ground had a motley crowd of 250 and the Bhaichung Bhutias, playing for the national team for the first time since February, recorded a 1-1 draw against the Spanish third division team.         
	Surkumar Singh put the Indians in front in the 24th minute with one of his trademark long drives but Alberto equalised in the 65th minute through a penalty. Mehrajuddin Wadoo pulled him back as he was about to shoot and referee Carlos Arnau pointed to the spot.         
	With Sameer Naik pulling a hamstring on his right leg during a practice session on Friday, N.S. Manju replaced him as the left back. Otherwise, it was more or less the set team that was fielded in the first half. The senior teams 45-minute skirmish gave the national coach an idea of who stands where.         
	The goal came somewhat unexpetedly. Following a clearance from the deep an overlapping Surkumar found enough space and time to volley his shot to perfection. It did not give rival goalkeeper Sergio a chance.         
	The second half saw the Indian substitutes taking field. The move was to give everyone a look in. Syed Rahim Nabi was upfront partnering Abhishek Yadav.         
	Rennedy Singh was on the right of midfield  there were a few surprises like that. Anthony was there in the first half. So there was no point playing Rennedy on the left when we already have Clifford (Miranda) in that slot. Yeah, we were missing Rennedys class in the first half, Houghton said after the match.

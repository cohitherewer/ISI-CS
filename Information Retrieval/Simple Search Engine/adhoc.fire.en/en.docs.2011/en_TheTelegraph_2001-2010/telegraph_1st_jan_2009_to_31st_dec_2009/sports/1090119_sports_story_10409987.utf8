	Karachi: Visiting captain Mahela Jayawardene Sunday said he and his players have an obligation to honour the commitment made by their board, maintaining that Sri Lanka have never had reservations about playing in Pakistan in the past         
	We discussed the security in Pakistan before the tour and decided it was our obligation to fulfil the commitments made by our administrators. We also felt that as players we had an obligation to play in Pakistan now just as they have done for us in the past, Jayawardene said.         
	We have faced no problems playing in Pakistan. We were here for the Asia Cup and we had a good time. Let us hope it remains the same for this tour and everything goes well, he said after arriving in Pakistan.         
	The Sri Lanka skipper also played down the hype surrounding mystery spinner Ajantha Mendis.         
	I look at this way  he is performing well and he can handle pressure which is good for us, but he is one individual and we focus on performing as a team. If we win, it is as a team, if we lose, it is as a team, he said.         
	Jayawardene said Mendis had benefited from having the experienced Muttiah Muralidharan as his bowling partner.         
	Murli is someone who has faced many challenges and issues in his career and come through. He is there to guide Mendis and if he (Mendis) can learn from him he will follow in the same path as Murli, he said.         
	The visiting captain admitted that his batsmen were not as consistent as they should have been in recent months.         
	Our lack of consistency is a worry but in the end what matters is we are still winning matches and some tight ones at that. It shows our players have character and that is good for our cricket, he said.         
	We have been giving chances to some young and new players and they are learning. We are working to a plan to recognise those players who can play a role in the 2011 World Cup.

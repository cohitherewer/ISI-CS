	Stockholm: Wearing an old-style swimsuit, Michael Phelps missed out on two finals and barely qualified for a third on Tuesday at a World Cup short-course meet.         
	Phelps, who won a record eight gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, failed to qualify for the finals of the 100m freestyle and 100 backstroke. He later qualified in the 100 medley, finishing seventh in 53.13 seconds  more than half a second slower than fastest qualifier Darian Townsend of South Africa.         
	Phelps, a 24-year-old American who was competing for the first time since the world championships in August, was sporting a beard and swimming in the old-style swimsuit that will become the standard next year. Most other swimmers used faster high-tech suits.         
	He finished 16th in qualifying for the 100 freestyle in 47.77 seconds. Eight swimmers advanced to the final, with Stefan Nystrand of Sweden recording the fastest qualifying time of 45.93. In the 100 backstroke, Phelps was disqualified. The referee didnt immediately specify why.         
	Phelps did not compete in either of those two events in a full length pool in Beijing, when he broke Mark Spitzs record of seven gold medals won at the 1972 Munich Olympics.         
	His coach, Bob Bowman, said Monday he wants Phelps to use the old-style suit in the lead-up to the national championships next year.         
	Phelps said before the meet that he was not in the best shape but wanted to use the competition in Stockholm to test his form and the old-style swimsuit.         
	Also, Jing Zhao of China set a world record in the womens 50 backstroke in 26.08. She beat the previous world record of 26.17, set by Marieke Guehrer of Australia four days ago in Moscow.

                                                   Huge setback for Md. Sp.
                      
	Margao: Dempo SC thumped Mohammedan Sporting 4-1 despite being reduced to ten men midway through the second half in their I-League match at Nehru Stadium Thursday. Dempo are fourth on the league table following the victory.         
	Mohammedan Sporting have to win their last encounter against Churchill Brothers and hope that United SC (23) lose to Vasco if they are to escape the ignominy of relegation.         
	Dempo, leading 3-0 at half time, scored through Ranty Martins (8th, 22nd), Roberto Mendes DSilva (34th) and Joaquim Abranches (88th).         
	Dempo have 30 points from 20 matches while Mohammedan Sporting, who have been pushed deeper into the relegation zone, have 22 points from 21 outings. JCT too are on 22 points but with a match in hand. (PTI)

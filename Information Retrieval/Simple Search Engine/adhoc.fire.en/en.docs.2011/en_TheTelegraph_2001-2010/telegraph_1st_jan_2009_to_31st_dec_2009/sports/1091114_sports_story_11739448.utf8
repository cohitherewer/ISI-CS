The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | John Terry doubtful vs Brazil
                                                                                                                                   John Terry doubtful vs Brazil
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Doha: England captain John Terry is doubtful for the friendly international against Brazil in Doha on Saturday because of an ankle injury, after he failed to appear for a scheduled press conference, though England manager Fabio Capello remains confident he will play.         
	The 28-year-old centre-half was to speak to the media at the Ritz Carlton Hotel Friday but did not emerge, leading to concerns over his fitness. Manchester City midfielder Gareth Barry attended the press conference in Terrys place.         
	If he is ruled out, it would be another inconvenience for Fabio Capello, who is already preparing without Frank Lampard, Rio Ferdinand, David Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Glen Johnson, Ashley Cole, Emile Heskey, Carlton Cole and David James, all out injured.         
	I hope that John Terry will be fit, Capello said. But in case he doesnt recover, Wayne Rooney could find himself wearing the captains armband.         
	...If he (Terry)s not 100 per cent fit, he wont play and the captain will be Rooney.         
	Terrys ankle compounds Englands luckless run with injuries that saw Lampard return home with fears that he may be out until Christmas after the midfielder suffered a thigh injury in training. If the worst fears are realised  that he will take up to seven weeks to recover  then it will be a severe blow to Chelseas Premier League title ambitions.         
	The Football Association was Thursday playing down claims that Lampards injury, which was suffered in training, was worse than first thought and stated that they hoped he would be ready to play for Chelsea against Wolverhampton Wanderers a week from Saturday. At worst, they hoped it would be two weeks.         
	Meanwhile, Carlos Alberto Parreira will resume as the coach of 2010 World Cup hosts South Africa Saturday, while Argentina coach Diego Maradona will also be in the spotlight.         
	South Africa host Japan in a friendly in Port Elizabeth, while Maradonas team visit Spain, one day before the volatile Argentina coach faces a disciplinary hearing which could sideline him from part of the 2010 World Cup.         
	Another match will see Italy host the Netherlands in Pescara to show solidarity with the Abruzzo region hit by an earthquake that killed 297 people in April, and left thousands homeless.         
	Slovakia host a United States team weakened by domestic commitments, and Denmark entertain South Korea in other meetings between teams who have already booked their places in South Africa. Germany have cancelled their match at home to Chile because of the death of goalkeeper Robert Enke.

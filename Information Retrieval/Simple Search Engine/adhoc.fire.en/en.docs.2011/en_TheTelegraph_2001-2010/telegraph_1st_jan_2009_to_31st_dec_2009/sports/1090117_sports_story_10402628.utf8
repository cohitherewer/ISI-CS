                                                   Morkel powers SA to victory
                      
	Melbourne: South Africa rode twin half centuries by Neil McKenzie and JP Duminy and some late fireworks by Albie Morkel to edge past Australia by three wickets in the opening one-dayer of the five match series here Friday.         
	Chasing 272 for a win, the Proteas survived a middle-order collapse to romp home with three deliveries to spare in a thrilling floodlit contest.         
	Duminy (71) and McKenzie laid the foundation before Morkel played a brilliant 40-run cameo, besides sharing a 50-run eighth-wicket stand with Johan Botha (11) to seal the win for the South Africans.         
	Opting to bat first, the Australians were left to rue a slow batting start and shoddy bowling at the death in the see-saw contest.         
	Shaun Marsh top-scored for the hosts with a 97-ball 79. David Husseys 50-ball 52 and under-fire skipper Ricky Pontings 46 were the only other notable contributions in the total after a slow start left them 146 for three in 31 overs.

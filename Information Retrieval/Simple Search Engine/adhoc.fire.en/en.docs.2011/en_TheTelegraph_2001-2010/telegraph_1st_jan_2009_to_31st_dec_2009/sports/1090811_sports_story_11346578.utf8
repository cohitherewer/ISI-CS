The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shadow falls between Tharoor and Pak trip
                                                     Shadow falls between Tharoor and Pak trip
    - Imran khan is Shaharyars first choice for books launch in Pakistan           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Shashi Tharoor                                 
	Calcutta: Shaharyar Khan wasnt present at the India launch of Shadows Across The Playing Field, in Mumbai, last week.         
	Well, co-author Shashi Tharoor isnt expected to be around at the Pakistan release of the book, in Lahore, some time next month.         
	There was nothing political about Shaharyars absence. Tharoors no-show, though, would have everything to do with politics.         
	A former under-secretary general at the UN, the debonair Tharoor is a minister of state for external affairs in the Manmohan Singh government.         
	Whatever the occasion, its unthinkable that, right now, an Indian minister would be travelling to Pakistan.         
	Clearly, the reality is that the shadows arent limited to the playing field.         
	Given the state of Indo-Pak relations, I doubt very much whether Shashi will be able to make it I wasnt in Mumbai, but will definitely be in New Delhi for the function there, Shaharyar, a one-time foreign secretary and a former chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking from London, on Monday, he added: Its so nice that (Sachin) Tendulkar did the honours in Mumbai I dont know wholl be the chief guest in New Delhi, but Ill check with Imran (Khan) if hell be available to do the honours in Lahore         
	Imrans certainly my first choice, but (having taken to politics) hes so busy nowadays If he cant make it, then Ill probably request Wasim Akram Hopefully, at the launch, Ill be able to get non-cricket dignitaries too         
	That wont be a big ask as the suave Shaharyar isnt short on friends in high places.         
	Consider this: Nawaz Sharif appointed Shaharyar as the manager for the India tour in early 1999. Then, in late 2003, Sharifs nemesis (at that point in time), Pervez Musharraf, gave him the PCB chairmanship!         
	Having played a role in the revival of Indo-Pak cricket, both in 1998-99 and 2003-04, its understandable that Shaharyar (who is closely related to royal families in India) is very, very disappointed that such ties have again been snapped.         
	I can understand reservations about touring Pakistan, especially after the attack on the Sri Lankans, but once relations improve, I dont see why the Pakistan team cant visit India, Shaharyar, who stepped down as the PCB chairman in October 2006, soon after the Oval fiasco, said.         
	Fanatical about cricket, he has been watching the ongoing Ashes series in the UK and will return to Pakistan around August 21.         
	Shaharyar, incidentally, is a visiting professor at the Lahore University of Management Sciences and teaches foreign policy.         
	Thats the only thing I really know, he quipped, rather modestly.         
	Meanwhile, according to Pramod Kapoor of Roli Books, the publishers, there will be a release in Chandigarh as well. New Delhi, Chandigarh and Lahore Thats the plan and the dates will soon be finalised, he pointed out.         
	While a politician may do the honours in New Delhi, Imran is also the publishing houses first choice for the Pakistan launch.         
	Definitely doesnt come as a surprise.

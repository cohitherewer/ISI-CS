	Colombo: Spinner Rangana Heraths maiden five-wicket haul helped Sri Lanka to their first home Test series victory against Pakistan as the hosts won the second Test by seven wickets with two days to spare on Tuesday.         
	Needing 171 runs to win, Sri Lanka reached the target for the loss of just three wickets to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.         
	Sri Lanka won the first match by 50 runs in Galle last week.         
	Sri Lanka hadnt won a Test series against Pakistan at home in five previous attempts.         
	Opener Malinda Warnapura set up the win for the hosts with a brisk 54 off 56 balls, his seventh Test half-century. He was caught behind by wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal off seam bowler Abdur Rauf after hitting seven fours and a six.         
	His partner Tharanga Paranavitana departed earlier for 17 bowled by spinner Saeed Ajmal.         
	Captain Kumar Sangakkara was caught by Misbah-ul Haq at slip off spin bowler Shoaib Malik for 46.         
	Earlier, Herath bowled a mesmerising spell in the post-lunch session to steal the momentum as Pakistan lost their last eight second innings wickets for just 26 runs, squandering the contribution of Fawad Alam who struck 168.         
	The visitors were well placed on 294 for two at lunch on the third day but crumbled to 320 all out in their second innings.         
	Seamer Nuwan Kulasekera complimented Herath with four wickets.         
	Sangakkaras decision to hand Herath the second new ball soon after lunch produced immediate results when Mohammed Yousuf was trapped lbw for six.         
	Misbah made just three before he was out lbw to Kulasekera.         
	Alam was caught by Warnapura off Herath after spending more than six hours at the crease. He faced 259 balls and hit 15 boundaries and a six.         
	Malik, Pakistans top-scorer in the first innings, was bowled for six by Herath, who returned five for 99. Kulasekera returned four for 37.         
	Alam had joined captain Younis Khan in a 200-run stand for the second wicket to resurrect Pakistans chances.         
	Khan was out shortly before lunch for 82, his 21st Test half century, when he attempted a reckless reverse-sweep off a full-toss from part-time off-spinner Paranavitana and was caught by wicketkeeper Tillekaratne Dilshan. His runs came off 152 balls and included seven boundaries.         
	Pakistan were bundled out for 90 on the first day, their worst Test innings against Sri Lanka. (AP)

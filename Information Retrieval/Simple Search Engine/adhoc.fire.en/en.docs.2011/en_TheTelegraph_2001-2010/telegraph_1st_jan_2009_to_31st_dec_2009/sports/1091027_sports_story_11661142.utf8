	New Delhi: Subroto Cup returned to Bengal after a gap of nine years when Sports Authority of India (SAI) Centre, Calcutta defeated Government Central High Secondary School , Mizoram 1-0 in the under-17 final at the Ambedkar Stadium on Monday.

	In Mondays final, the Calcutta team were clearly the better side but they had to wait till the extra time to score the all-important goal.         
	After the stipulated time ended in a goalless draw, midfielder Roikhina Nongtou scored from a penalty in the 14th minute of the extended period to earn the victory for the SAI boys.         
	Coached by SK Bandopadhaya, the Calcutta team looked better in their passing and ball control and used the width of the ground intelligently to keep their physically superior opponents at bay.         
	Tall central midfielder Ranjan Mistry attracted attention of the spectators because of his ability to distribute the ball and defence splitting passes.

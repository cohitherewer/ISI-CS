                                                     DareDevils triumph 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Virender Sehwag during the DareDevils match against Wayamba at the Kotla on Sunday. (PTI)                           
	New Delhi: The loudest cheers at the Kotla were reserved for Virender Sehwag when the playing eleven of the two teams were announced over the public address system before the start of the match on Sunday.         
	As if to prove how right the spectators were, Sehwag launched a calculated attack on the Wayamba Elevens almost immediately and it turned out to be a crucial factor in the Delhi DareDevils 50-run win in the Group D Champions League encounter.         
	The inclusion of Glenn McGrath in the playing eleven was another reason for the DareDevils victory. The attack that looked rather toothless against the Victoria Bushrangers in the previous match suddenly had a lot of depth as McGrath produced the glimpses of his old magic with a two-wicket haul.         
	In the end, facing a Delhi total of 170 for five, the Sri Lankans proved a complete mismatch and could score only 120 for seven that kept Delhis chances of moving to the next round.         
	Making a return to top level cricket after a shoulder surgery, Sehwag was simply unstoppable during his innings of 66 off 42 deliveries that was studded with 10 stunning hits to the fence and a huge six off leg-spinner Kaushal Lokuarachchi over long on.         
	To give Sehwag company on equal footing was Dinesh Karthik, who slammed 61 in 41 balls with the help of five fours and three sixes that came off consecutive deliveries off Ajantha Mendis in the penultimate over.         
	Never for a moment had Wayamba looked capable of getting rid of a rampaging Sehwag, who was later adjudged the Man of the Match.

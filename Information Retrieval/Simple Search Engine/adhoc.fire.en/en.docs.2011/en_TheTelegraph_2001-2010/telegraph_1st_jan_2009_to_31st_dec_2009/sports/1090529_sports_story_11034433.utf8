                                                   Wrong of Pakistan to accuse India: Lorgat
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive officer Haroon Lorgat said on Thursday that it was wrong on the part of Pakistan to accuse the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) of trying to influence the parent body to shift the 2011 World Cup matches out of the troubled nation.         
	Reacting to a report quoting Pakistan sports minister Pir Aftab Shah Jilani that BCCIs role in shifting matches was deplorable, Lorgat said: It is irresponsible on the part of Pakistan to issue such statements.         
	Talking to the reporters during a promotional, Lorgat said it was the decision of the ICC to shift the World Cup matches.         
	India had nothing to do with the decision on Pakistan. It was a collective decision by the ICC board, he said.         
	Lorgat was of the opinion that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) did not handle the situation in a proper manner when the ICC decided to withdraw matches.         
	If Pakistan had done half of what it is doing now the situation could have been better, Lorgat commented.         
	The ICC boss said he was confident that the 2011 World Cup would be held without any security trouble in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.         
	We will review the security situation in the three countries. Thats a normal part of our process, he said.         
	Lorgat also revealed that ICC wont make a slot available in its Future Tours Programme (FTP) for Champions League T20. We dont keep windows in the ICC Future Tours Programme (FTP) for domestic events.         
	Theres no proposal for the Champions League or any other domestic events in the FTP, Lorgat said.         
	The FTP only features ICC events... the ICC Cricket World Cup, the ICC Champions Trophy and the ICC World Twenty20, besides bilateral fixtures between international teams.         
	Lorgat said it was wrong to assume that T20 cricket would diminish the importance of Test cricket. Despite the T20 World Cup and the IPL, peoples response to Test series in India and South Africa was overwhelming, he said.         
	Asked about ICCs plans on organising the much talked about day and night Tests, Lorgat said, Its still too early for day and night Tests, but we encourage the concept.

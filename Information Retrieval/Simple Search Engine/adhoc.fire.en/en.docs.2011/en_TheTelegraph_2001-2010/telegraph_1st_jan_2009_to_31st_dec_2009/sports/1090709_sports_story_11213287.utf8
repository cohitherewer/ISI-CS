                                                     Warring parties sound confident 
            A STAFF REPORTER            Bhaichung Bhutia                           
	Calcutta: Both the Mohun Bagan and Bhaichung Bhutia camps exuded confidence on the eve of the much-awaited Indian Football Association (IFA) governing body meeting regarding the impasse between the footballer and the club.         
	The IFA have requested the presence of police for the meeting, to be held at the Town Hall here Thursday. Bhaichung will be represented by his lawyer Ushanath Banerjee in the meeting.         
	Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra said he was confident that the governing body would rule in the clubs favour. He, however, added that the club would wait till the last minute for Bhaichungs apology.         
	We are not vindictive. We dont want to cause any harm to his career. We will wait till the last minute for his apology. If he says sorry, we will consider the matter closed and he will be eligible to play for the club again, Mitra said.         
	A source close to Bhaichung, who is presently in Barcelona, said the India captain was confident about the merit of his case.         
	Its a sensitive case. We want the dispute to end quickly. We want Bhaichung to start playing soon, IFA secretary Utpal Ganguli said.         
	The secretary denied that the issue had turned into a prestige battle between Bagan and East Bengal.         
	Its not a club vs club fight. Its an issue between a footballer and a club.         
	The dispute between Snehasish Chakrabarty and East Bengal, though not on the agenda for the governing body meeting, will also be discussed.         
	East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick on Wednesday struck off the midfielders name from his list. East Bengal, however, have decided to send a letter to the IFA, along with the related documents, seeking action against the footballer for alleging that the club had forged his signature.         
	East Bengal will ask the governing body to appoint a handwriting expert to verify the footballers complaint, the club decided in its executive committee meeting on Wednesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods paying for mistakes
                                                                                                                       7                                        Woods paying for mistakes
            Philip Sherwell            Tiger Woods                           
	New York: In a lakeside Florida mansion, marriage counsellors, lawyers and public relations advisors are this weekend engaged in a bizarre and expensive round of shuttle diplomacy between the worlds richest athlete and his furious wife.         
	For Tiger Woods, a control freak accustomed to calling the shots both on the golf course and in his private life, the unravelling of an image as carefully manicured as a country club green is both agonising and self-inflicted.         
	The scandal of his philandering is so damaging to his Mr Clean brand that the publicity-averse superstar is considering an invitation to appear on the sofa of talk show queen Oprah Winfrey, this newspaper has learned.         
	For that interview to work, quite possibly with Elin Nordegren, 29, the wife on whom he cheated, by his side, Woods, 33, would have to engage in the sort of public confessional that has previously been anathema to him.         
	His minders have not granted such access since a 1997 interview with a mens magazine backfired after he was quoted telling dirty and racial jokes.         
	That profile also hinted that when he was not playing the fairways, he was playing the field from what some in the sport call the real PGA  the Party Groupie Association (rather than the Professional Golfers Association).         
	The Oprah strategy is under discussion in Camp Tiger as a series of tawdry new claims emerge about Woods alleged infidelities after he admitted unspecified transgressions and sins last week.         
	In the most recent, it emerged on Saturday that an unnamed waitress at a VIP cocktail bar in Orlando has hired a lawyer as she prepares to go public with claims of an alleged two-year affair that began in 2004 when she was 20, according to a celebrity news website.         
	There were also reports of several other alleged affairs in the US and one some years ago in London, purported to have been with an unmarried television newsreader.         
	Over the previous few days, he had been linked in a string of reports to Rachel Uchitel, a New York party planner, Jaimee Grubbs, a Los Angeles cocktail waitress, and Kalika Moquin, a Las Vegas club marketing manager.         
	A financial deal was reportedly underway to secure the silence of Rachel, whose sexual encounters with Woods were allegedly fuelled by a prescription sleeping drug, Ambien (which is said to enhance sex in the minutes after it is taken), according to her friends quoted on a website. Meanwhile, Jaimee said she has racy texts and voice messages to prove she had a 31-month affair.         
	Jared Shapiro, executive editor of the magazine that ran the story on Kalika, said hundreds of thousands of dollars were being offered for the stories of other alleged paramours.         
	The latest claims come as lawyers for Woods and Elin negotiate an upgrade of the prenuptial agreement signed before their Barbados wedding in 2004.         
	While it is usually divorce that hits the famous hard in their wallets, Woods will have to dig deep just to keep the mother of his two young children married to him.         
	Elin will receive an immediate $5 million, with staggered payments worth up to an additional $55 million if she stays with her husband for another two years, a lawyer familiar with the negotiations said.         
	That would mean she would receive more than $75,000 per day just to remain with him for two more years and sign a permanent non-disclosure agreement.         
	But for Woods, this is not simply a case of avoiding marital meltdown for the sake of love and the children.         
	His advisers know there is also a crucial financial incentive to shore up the relationship in the eyes of nervous sponsors who made him the worlds first athlete to earn a billion dollars.         
	Woodss main commercial backers have so far stuck by their one-man sports industry.           THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

                                                   Nine make shortlist
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                                      
	A total of nine candidates, including well-known football administrators Savio Messias, Shaji Prabhakaran and Gautam Kar were Wednesday shortlisted for the post of the general secretary of the All India Football Federation (AIFF).  
	 According to sources, the shortlisted candidates will be called for an interview next month following which the final decision will be taken by the acting president Praful Patel.  
	 Sources said that the selection of Messias, who is widely regarded as one of the best choices, had looked uncertain at one point as the AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco was opposed to his inclusion.  
	 Subodh Bhatnagar, a sports administrator from the Indian Air Force and the Chandigarh Football Association secretary, Rakesh Baxi have also made the shortlist.  
	 Around half-a-dozen candidates have been picked from a list of 35 people for the post of the chief executive officer of the I-League.   
	 While the AIFF deputy general secretary, Gautam Kar and director competition, Anil Kamath will receive interview calls, former Mahindra United player and coach Harish Rao has found a place on the list.  
	 Meanwhile, Patel said the financial condition of the AIFF was not as bad as projected in the media adding that there had been no default on the part of Zee Sports in paying the federation its dues.  
	 ldquo;There has been a lot of speculation which is not true. Zee recently released some money and there was no such problem. Reports of the AIFF breaking some of its fixed deposits to run its affairs is also not true, rdquo; Patel said.  
	 As for the ambitious AIFF-Bharti Academy which has run into troubled waters, Patel said he had spoken to Bharti and had requested them not to back out of the project.  
	 The academy ldquo;can come up as and when the land is available, rdquo; Patel said. ldquo;It was to come up in Goa but a land dispute arose and Bharti agreed to shift it to Haryana. But then, the Haryana government could not give us the land required for the project. rdquo;

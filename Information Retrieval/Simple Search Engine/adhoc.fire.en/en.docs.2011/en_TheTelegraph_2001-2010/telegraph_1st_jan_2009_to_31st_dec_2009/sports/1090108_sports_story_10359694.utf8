            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mumbai will host its first international sporting event since 26/11 with the Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon 2009 on January 18.         
	Nearly 25,000 have entered the five-race event that should bring cheer to the city which has been starved of action due to the cancellation or postponement of events in the aftermath of the terror attacks six weeks ago. The organisers held the launch ceremony at Hotel Trident on Wednesday.         
	The full marathon will see Kenyan John Kelai return to defend his mens title. The womens field is led by Kenyan Margaret Okeyo.

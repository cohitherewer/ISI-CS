  - Champions Trophy
  -   Meet delayed, but ICC sticks to March 2008 ODI rankings         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has retained the seedings and groups, which were announced last year, for the much-delayed sixth edition of the Champions Trophy.         
	Clearly, many are bound to find this odd.         
	Scheduled to have been held between September 11-28 last year, in Pakistan, the tournament will now be staged in South Africa, from September 24 to October 5.         
	While its true that the seedings and groups were finalised on the basis of the ODI rankings as on March 12, 2008, the same have been retained because the upcoming Champions Trophy is essentially a rollover tournament, a well-placed source in the ICC told The Telegraph.         
	Accordingly, India remains clubbed with holders Australia, the highly temperamental Pakistan and the West Indies, champions in 2004. Thats group A.         
	Group B comprises South Africa, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and England.         
	The seedings, based on the ODI rankings of 16 months ago, are: Australia (1), South Africa (2), New Zealand (3), India (4), Pakistan (5), Sri Lanka (6), England (7) and the West Indies (8).         
	Were the seedings to be driven by the latest rankings, then the changes would be significant, with the new order reading: South Africa, Australia, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, England, Sri Lanka and the West Indies.         
	The groups too, as a result, would have a different look.         
	In April, of course, an ICC spokesman had said that the seedings and groups would indeed be redone. So, there has been a flip-flop.         
	Meanwhile, according to the source, the matches will only be held at the Wanderers (Johannesburg) and at the SuperSport Park (Centurion, a short drive away from Joburg).         
	Thats in keeping with a decision that one city (or twin cities, either full-fledged or loosely seen as being so) alone would play host, the source added.         
	One understands the fixtures could be released this week itself.         
	The most awaited clash, in the group stage at least, has to be the one between India (joint winners in 2002) and the World T20 champions, Pakistan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Knights farewell on the   beach
                                                   Knights farewell on the   beach
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: Co-owner Jay Mehtas formal meeting with the Kolkata Knight Riders support staff, scheduled to be held in Johannesburg, has been called off.         
	Mr Mehta, I guess, has got all the feedback he needed Otherwise, the meeting wouldve been held later today (Thursday) or tomorrow morning, a member of the Knights support staff told The Telegraph.         
	Mehtas meeting with John Buchanan (head of cricket operations) and the rest wouldve been the last in a series initiated at principal owner Shah Rukh Khans behest.         
	Actually, Mehta acted as Shah Rukhs eyes and ears in the second half of IPL 2009 and would be preparing a report to facilitate a full-fledged review of the franchises performance.         
	Shah Rukh had, of course, been with the Knights for the first five matches and wouldve gone back to South Africa had the Brendon McCullums been in contention for a last-four berth.         
	The Knights, as it turned out, lost eight in a row before winning the last two. The wins, though, made no difference to the franchises standing  No.8 in the eight-team competition.         
	Meanwhile, after knocking the defending champions, the Rajasthan Royals, out of the tournament on Wednesday, the Knights spent a couple of hours at the Ushaka Beach in Durban.         
	It wasnt far from the team hotel, the Southern Sun Elangeni.         
	The players signed and exchanged T-shirts Plenty of photographs were taken We didnt do well in IPL 2009, but the mood was good. After all, wed at least ended with a couple of wins, another member of the support staff pointed out.         
	Buchanan, who has no plans to put in his papers, was present. Mehta, representing all the owners, too.         
	Having no role to play in the remainder of the tournament, the Knights took flights to different continents from Johannesburg.

                                                   Aussies make solid start
                      
	Durban: Phil Hughes played a thrilling innings as he and fellow opener Simon Katich hit centuries for Australia on the first day of the second Test against South Africa at Kingsmead here Friday.         
	Australia were in a strong position at 303 for four at close although South Africa fought back after a pummeling in the first three hours of play.         
	Hughes (115) and Katich (108) put on 184 for the first wicket, scoring at better than four runs an over, in a partnership dominated by Hughes, who thrashed 19 fours and two sixes in a 151-ball innings.         
	Fellow left-hander Katich was more sedate in making his runs off 190 deliveries with 16 fours.         
	Hughes, 20, reached his century with two successive sixes off left-arm spinner Paul Harris to become Australias youngest Test century maker since Doug Walters, who was eight days short of his 20th birthday when he made 155 against England in Brisbane in 1965/66.         
	South Africa claimed to have made plans to counter Hughes after his second innings 75 in the first Test last weekend  he made a duck in the first innings  but the little left-hander unleashed a dazzling array of strokes against some wayward bowling.         
	South Africa, seeking to draw level in the three-match series, started the match badly. They bowled poorly on a good batting pitch, dropped two catches and used up both their referrals to the television umpire.         
	The hosts made a comeback later in the day before Mike Hussey and Marcus North put on an unbeaten 37 at stumps.           (AFP)

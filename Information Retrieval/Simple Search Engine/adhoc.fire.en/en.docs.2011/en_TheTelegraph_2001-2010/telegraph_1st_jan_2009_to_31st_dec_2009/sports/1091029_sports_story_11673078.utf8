                                                     EB banking on Bhutia pep talk 
            A STAFF REPORTER            Bhaichung Bhutia and Yusif Yakubu during East Bengals practice session at the club ground on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: East Bengal cant be in a more terrible situation. Without a coach, sans a win yet and senior players injured, they face a tough task ahead of their fifth I-League match against newly-promoted Salgaocar Sports Club.         
	The red and gold brigade are now banking on mentor Bhaichung Bhutias pep talk for a turnaround against the Goan team at the Barasat Stadium on Thursday.         
	Though assistant coach Tushar Rakshit was there, it was the Bhaichung show all the way.         
	Whether exchanging notes with Yusif Yakubu or giving instructions to Alvito DCunha, Bhaichung was the centre of the attraction.         
	Bhaichung though will not be on the field on the morrow as he is yet to recover from hamstring injury.         
	You cant be brooding over something which has already happened. We lost to Mohun Bagan. Okay. But we will bounce back, he said.         
	Later on Wednesday evening, Bhaichung said that he would be in the stands watching the match and will talk to the players at half-time to give his inputs.         
	 One thing for sure there wont be any text messages to Tushar da. He doesnt need my inputs, Bhaichung told The Telegraph.         
	In the morning, Bhaichung had also backed the goalkeepers and said that they should be given time to settle down. Dont banish them please, Bhaichung pleaded.         
	East Bengal will go with Arup Debnath under the bar as Abhra Mondal is low on confidence after his five-star performance against Mohun Bagan on Sunday. The defence will see a change with Nigerian Uga Okpara coming in as the central defender. That means Mehrajuddin Wadoo will be in his favourite position as a defensive screen in front of the back four.         
	Frontliner Abel Hammond is nursing a hamstring injury and may not start, while Rennedy Singh has been ruled out of the Thursday clash.         
	Captain Syed Rahim Nabi said: We have got to look forward to the next match. We want to give our fans something to cheer about.         
	That wont be easy though. For Salgaocar, buoyed by their consecutive wins are on a high.         
	We want full points and nothing else, said American coach Tim Hankinson.         
	They are low on confidence and its our best chance to make the most of it, he said.

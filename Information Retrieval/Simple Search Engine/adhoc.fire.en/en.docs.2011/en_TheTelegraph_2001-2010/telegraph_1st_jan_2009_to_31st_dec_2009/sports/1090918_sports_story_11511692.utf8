                                                   Bhutia would lift gloom: Subhas
            UR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Gloom and desperation seems to follow East Bengal wherever they go nowadays.         
	A day after the red and gold brigade suffered their third consecutive defeat of the season, against Lajong FC in the Durand Cup, Subhas Bhowmick tried his best to put up a brave front, but the whispers against his choice of foreign players are increasingly becoming audible.         
	The distressed East Bengal coach had a sympathetic ear in Bhaichung Bhutia who dropped in at the team hotel Thursday afternoon. Bhowmick said all he had asked the India captain to do was to come to practice; he felt the star strikers presence would serve to lift the teams morale.         
	But Bhowmick really has it hard this time. The club officials are pointing fingers at the coach, blaming him for his poor selection of foreign players.         
	Our choice of foreign players was wrong. Those who selected them should take responsibility, said a senior East Bengal official on Thursday. But Bhowmick, it seemed, was in no mood to get into a war of words.         
	All I can say is that the entire team failed against Lajong on Wednesday. The team did well in the first half but was a complete flop after conceding the goal in the second session.         
	The coach admitted that recruiting Czech defender Jan Berger was not a good decision. Berger may not fit into our system of football but the same cannot be said about (Omar) Sebastian. He should be given time to settle down.         
	Against Mahindra United on Friday, Bhowmick has decided to rest Berger and start with the Argentine striker. On Thursday, the coach asked assistant coach Tushar Rakshit to take the team for practice. In my 42 years of association with football, I have never suffered such humiliation, Bhowmick said. At the moment my main aim is to do well against Mahindra and recover prestige.         
	Asked whether he would resign in the light of this debacle, Bhowmick said it was up to the club management to decide his future.         
	The club has every right to throw me out if they think so. I am in no position to call the shots. But I will not go jobless if sacked, the coach said.

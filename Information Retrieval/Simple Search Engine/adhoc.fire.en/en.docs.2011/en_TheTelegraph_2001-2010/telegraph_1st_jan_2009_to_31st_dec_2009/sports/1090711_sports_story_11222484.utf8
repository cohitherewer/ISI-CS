The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Goosen recovers to be in lead
                                                   Goosen recovers to be in lead
                      
	Loch Lomond: Retief Goosen duffed his first shot like a weekend hacker before proving his pedigree with an eight-under-par 63 to sail into a two-stroke lead early in the Scottish Open second round Friday.         
	The 40-year-old South African hit seven birdies and an eagle after recovering from the surprise of dribbling his drive a mere 180 yards into the rough at the par-four 10th, his opening hole.         
	Goosen, the Loch Lomond course-record holder after firing a 62 in 1997, finished on 11-under 131. Adam Scott (67) was in second place on 133, one ahead of fellow Australian Marcus Fraser (66) and Germanys Martin Kaymer (65).

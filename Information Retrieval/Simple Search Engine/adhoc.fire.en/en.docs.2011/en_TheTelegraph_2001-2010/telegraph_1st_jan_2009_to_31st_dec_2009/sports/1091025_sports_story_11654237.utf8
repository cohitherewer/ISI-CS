The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | New Zealand coach Moles steps down
                                                   New Zealand coach Moles steps down
                      
	Wellington: New Zealand coach Andy Moles resigned Saturday, New Zealand Cricket (NZC) officials confirmed, ending a stand-off, in which senior players had appealed for him to be sacked.         
	Moles was standing down in the best interests of the organisation, following a review of the recent tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in South Africa, an NZC release said.         
	Chief executive Justin Vaughan said no immediate replacement would be named for the upcoming series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, leaving captain Daniel Vettori in charge of a coachless side. English-born Moles, a surprise choice to replace John Bracewell last November, as the coach of New Zealand, was contracted till the 2011 World Cup, but lasted less than a year in the job. His departure was seen as inevitable when he went into mediation talks on Friday, after it became public that senior players had raised concerns about his abilities.         
	Moles, 48, said he held no grudge against the players, but was aggrieved at the sudden revelation of their concerns.         
	It is unfortunate that it (coaching deficiencies) wasnt raised before and that will be looked at, Im sure, by New Zealand Cricket going forward, the former Warwickshire batsman said. If I had got some feedback earlier, we may have been able to quell this problem and been aware of it.         
	Under Moles tenure, New Zealands record has been patchy. Four Tests have been drawn and three lost, and in one-day Internationals, New Zealand have won nine and lost 10. (AFP)

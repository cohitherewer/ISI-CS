	Barcelona: After four straight defeats, Rafael Nadal returns to his favourite clay surface when he plays Tomas Berdych in the opening match of the Davis Cup final on Friday as Spain bids to retain their title against the Czech Republic.         
	Nadal, a four-time French Open champion, is looking forward to returning to the surface after failing to win a set during three straight defeats at the ATP World Tour Finals in London last week and losing in the semi-finals in Paris before that.         
	Those matches were on fast indoor surfaces, but the second-ranked Spaniard is now back on clay at the Palau Sant Jordi. He is determined to help Spain, playing for its fourth title in its fifth final since 2000, become the first team since Sweden in 1998 to defend their crown.         
	It wasnt a big surprise, Nadal said Thursday of his defeats in London. When you are not 100 percent at a tournament like that youre going to lose. Here I am 100 percent. I will be playing a little bit better I hope. You cant always play perfect ... but I think Im ready for tomorrow (Friday).         
	Nadal, who is 10-0 in Davis Cup singles matches on clay, has won four straight over Berdych since an ill-tempered defeat in Madrid three years ago that led to questions over how the 20th-ranked Czech will be received by the 16,000-capacity crowd.         
	Theres no problem between Rafael and I. I dont think this will play a part in this game, said Berdych, who is not discounting Nadal despite the Spaniards recent struggles. Hes going to play at home and hes going to play on his favourite surface. I think hes going to be at his best.         
	Nadal said: I have an excellent relation with Berdych. He made a mistake, I made a mistake and thats it.         
	The Davis Cup final caps a year that started with Nadal winning the Australian Open and dominating tennis as the top-ranked player.         
	But the four-time champion was upset in the fourth round by Robin Soderling at the French Open, couldnt defend his Wimbledon title because of injuries, dropped to No. 2 and failed to win another tournament.         
	The only important thing is to win the Davis Cup, Nadal said. I did all that I can in the second half of the season. I play good tournaments. I didnt win but I didnt play really bad tournaments. So the motivation is that, not to start the next season better, no. Now is only to win this tournament.         
	In the second singles match of the best-of-five series, David Ferrer was picked over Fernando Verdasco to face Radek Stepanek despite being sidelined for more than a month because of a hamstring injury.         
	Spain captain Albert Costa went with Ferrer, who is 9-3 in singles play, over Verdasco, who was the hero one year ago in Argentina as underdog Spain triumphed in Mar del Plata. Spain is a heavy favourite this time. The hosts have won 17 straight at home and 19 straight on clay.         
	I think its a strategic thing and Fernando has to play another day, Costa said. I think its the right player to play.         
	Ferrer and Stepanek have split all six of their previous matchups, including the two on clay, in a closely contested rivalry. It doesnt matter who it is  its going to be a tough match either way, the 12th-ranked Stepanek said. I was ready for either of them.         
	Verdasco, who also lost all three of his matches in London last week, has recovered from a foot injury and will team up with Feliciano Lopez for Saturdays doubles, as the Spanish pair are scheduled to take on Lukas Dlouhy and Jan Halek.

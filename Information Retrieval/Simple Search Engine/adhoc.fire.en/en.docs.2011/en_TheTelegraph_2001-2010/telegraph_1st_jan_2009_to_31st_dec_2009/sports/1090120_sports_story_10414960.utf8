	Calcutta: The visiting under-23 Bayern Munich side blanked East Bengal 5-1 in a practice match at their club ground on Monday.         
	Yilmaz, who scored the only goal against East Bengal on Saturday, netted in three goals while Muller and Stiier rounded off the tally for Bayern. Sunil Chetri scored the face-saving goal for the local club. The return of the national players made little difference to East Bengals performance as they looked helpless against their physically-superior opposition.         
	The visitors were leading 4-0 at the lemon break. The match was played for the full duration of 90 minutes.         
	Yilmaz started the scoring in the fourth minute with a grounder from the right of the top box. East Bengal goalkeeper Subrata Paul made a desperate effort to deny the German striker in the 26th minute, again from the right, but failed to stop it from going in.         
	The next minute Mueller scored a similar goal from the top box with a grounder.         
	Yilmaz completed his third, the fourth for his side, from a solo effort in the 41st minute. The forward beat a couple of East Bengal defenders with sheer pace, after receiving the ball near the centre line. He finished with a cool head past an advancing Paul.         
	East Bengals left-back Saumik Dey looked shaky and most of Bayerns goals came from his side. The visitors replaced Yilmaz at the start of the second half, much to East Bengals relief.         
	The red-and-gold brigades goal came through a brilliant move between Sanju Pradhan and Sunil Chetri. Sanju speeded down the right flank and sent an immaculate cross for striker Sunil who didnt make a mistake with his header. However, Sunil failed to convert a similar cross from Alvito D Cunha and headed straight into the Bayern goalkeepers hands.         
	Bayern increased their margin when Stieers overhead volley went in, after a terrible defensive lapse from Mehrajuddin Wadoo.         
	Coach Subhas Bhowmick didnt sound too upset with the teams performance.         
	Im happy. Im looking at it positively. I wanted to see how my players combine, Subhas said after the match.         
	East Bengal will start a residential camp at a Salt Lake hotel from Tuesday to strengthen the unity among the players.

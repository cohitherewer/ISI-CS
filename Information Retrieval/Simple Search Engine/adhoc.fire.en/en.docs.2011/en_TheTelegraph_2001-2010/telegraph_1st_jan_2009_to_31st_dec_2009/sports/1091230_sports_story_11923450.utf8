The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Match shouldve been called off earlier: Gambhir
                                                                                                                       7                                      Match shouldve been called off earlier: Gambhir
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Worlds top-ranked Test batsman and Delhiite, Gautam Gambhir, joined the growing list of Kotla pitch detractors on Tuesday, saying the 22-yard strip was simply not fit to hold the one-day International between India and Sri Lanka.         
	Talking to mediapersons here, Gambhir said the Match Referee did the right thing by calling off the match and it should have been abandoned even earlier. The match should have been called off earlier. The Match Referee surely thought hard before taking the decision. There was no doubt that it was not a one-day wicket, he said.         
	Asked to comment on the state of affairs in the Delhi and Districts Cricket Association (DDCA), Gambhir said: What can I say? Whole world knows what happened that day. I shouldnt say anything, but there is a need for someone to stand up and take the responsibility.         
	The Delhi DareDevils captain said the Kotla fiasco was not the best way to bring down the curtains on an engrossing India-Sri Lanka series.         
	Thats not the way we wanted to end the year. We wanted to make it 4-1 on the eve of the Bangladesh tour. It was simply disappointing, said the Delhi batsman.         
	Gambhir, however, was not ready to accept that Delhi cricket is going through a bad phase. Thats not true. There are five Delhi cricketers in the current Indian team. And look at the Delhi Ranji Trophy team. None of us were there, yet they reached the semi-final. I think Delhi have some very talented young cricketers, he said.         
	Speaking about his personal form, Gambhir said he still has miles to go.         
	The main thing is not to become the No.1 batsman in the world, but to score runs that contribute to the teams cause. Theres no point scoring runs if the team does not win. Ranking goes up and down regularly. Its important to score consistently.         
	Asked whether India should play more Test matches, Gambhir said playing the longest version of the game was the ultimate aim of all cricketers.         
	Every cricketer wants to play Test matches. None of us practise hard for hours to play one-dayers or Twenty20s. You dont need to practise so much for that. India should definitely play more Test matches.

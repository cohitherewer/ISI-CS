The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India is also unsafe, says Crowe
                                                   India is also unsafe, says Crowe
                      
	Christchurch: Former New Zealand captain Martin Crowe said on Monday that India has joined Pakistan as an unsafe country to tour due to terror strikes on its major cities like Mumbai and Delhi last year.         
	The time has come for the cricketing world to accept that Pakistan is an absolute no go zone. While one is sad for their talented top cricketers, Pakistan is completely unsafe and contemplation of playing there again has got to stop. But they are not alone.         
	In May last year, just 24 hours before I flew with the Royal Challengers Bangalore to Jaipur for a nothing Twenty20 match, eight bombs went off three-minutes apart killing over 100 civilians and tourists as it ripped through the crowded Pink Palace, Crowe wrote in a newspaper. We were forced to play the match a day later in front of an empty stadium and 3000 soldiers. It was a joke to be told to play.         
	Thats why you cant just isolate Pakistan. Lives have been taken on a regular basis from terror attacks in India over the last year in major cities like Mumbai in November, the worst in Bangalore in July and Delhi in September, Crowe said.         
	Having toured all around India with the IPL, the worst and scariest aspect is that when you leave your hotel you have no further control on anything, he added.         
	Crowe admitted that terror attacks were possible anywhere in the world but said probability was much higher in the subcontinent.         
	Maybe, someone, even the most famous of all, Sachin Tendulkar, might get severely hurt or disabled from a flying piece of shrapnel or glass, he said.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Revenge is not on Pauls mind
                                                     Revenge is not on Pauls mind
            OUR CORRESPONDENT              Subrata Paul                      
	Pune: Grudge is not a word that features in Subrata Pauls dictionary. At least, that is what Indias No.1 goalkeeper wants us to believe.         
	As he prepares to guard Pune FCs goal against East Bengal in their I-League clash on Saturday, Paul says he doesnt need to motivate himself by recalling all the pain and insult his former club inflicted on him during his stint in Calcutta last season.         
	I have nothing to prove. I dont motivate myself like that, Paul told The Telegraph on Friday. Even when I play for a village team, I imagine I am playing for India and the opponents are teams like Syria or others.         
	Pune FC are playing in the elite division for the first time and Paul was grateful to the team for giving him a lifeline after being dumped by East Bengal.         
	No one else was calling me, but Pune FC gave me the respect I deserved, he said.         
	Its a new team, but we have a very professional set-up, and the facilities here are among the best, the goalkeeper added.

                                                   Watson has inspired oldies: Vijai 
                      
	New York: Tom Watson had given senior players a second life with his inspirational British Open campaign, Vijai Singh said on Tuesday.         
	He added that the 59-year-olds performance at Turnberry, where he lost in a playoff, meant the Fijian had reassessed how much longer he himself could compete at the highest level.         
	Tom Watson, what a great story that is. That gave a second life to everybody, even in their 50s, Singh, 46, said in a conference call to promote next months meet at Liberty National which kicks off the FedExCup playoff series.         
	People can go out there and have one or two days of good scoring in a major. But leading the golf tournament, and even after 72 holes being tied and going into a playoff, is totally unheard of, Singh said about 59-year-old Watson.         
	The American lost a four-hole playoff at Turnberry to fellow American Stewart Cink.         
	It kind of gives us a second wind. I was thinking maybe 50, 51, 52, Id still have enough energy and strength to compete. But now after what Toms done it gives you a second life.         
	Singh, who has 34 career wins on the US PGA Tour, has had great success in his later years.         
	In 2007 he snapped a tie with Sam Snead for most tour wins after reaching the age of 40. His victories in the first two events of last years FedExCup series pushed that total to 22 and clinched the $10 million playoffs bonus.         
	Im working out really hard and I feel really strong right now, he said.         
	I can still compete with the young kids now. I dont know how long thats going to last. The body takes a lot of toll. The older you get the harder you have to work at it. Thats been my motto.         
	Ill see after I turn 50, Ill see how much more. If I can compete, I will keep going, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | One of my most fluent innings: Dravid
                                                                                                                                   One of my most fluent innings: Dravid
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Ahmedabad: Rahul Dravid thinks Mondays unbeaten 177 should rank as one of his most fluent innings. The former India captain said at a media conference that India need to reach at least 500 to put the Sri Lankans under pressure.               
	The following are excerpts         
	His thoughts at 32 for four         
	I knew we needed a partnership to get going. The South Africa game was also on the back of our minds when we were bowled out in 20 overs and the wicket became good later on. I knew if we could get through to lunch without losing any more wickets, batting would be easier. Yuvraj (Singh) was positive and played some good shots. We were able to put on a 100-run partnership and that set the platform for me and Mahi (Mahendra Singh Dhoni).         
	The way he went about the task         
	The first session was about getting through and not losing any more wickets. I told Yuvi, lets hang in there. We knew if we could get a 40/50 run stand, we would get a platform to build on. The second session was about consolidating. In the final session, we concentrated on cashing in on the partnerships and getting into a solid position. But the partnership with Yuvi built the base to the innings.         
	The wicket in the morning session         
	It did a bit but they bowled well. It was a bit sticky and aided swing. It happens in a Test match But the important part is we showed the character to fight back with a couple of good partnerships.         
	His innings         
	I would say a pretty good innings. At the end of the day Im unbeaten on 177. I was fluent right through and very much in control.         
	If he reckoned the knock as his most fluent in recent memory         
	I would say so Its nice to get this feeling of batting the way I have. Ive been through some tough times for a couple of seasons. I thought the flow has come back this year. It was probably one of my most fluent efforts over the last few seasons.         
	If playing the two Ranji matches in the lead up to the Test helped         
	It always helps to gain confidence. It helps when batting in the middle. I knew we had a bit of contest in our hands against their spinners and we responded to the challenge quite well.         
	On whether he had any specific plans         
	There was no pre-conceived plan. But I batted well and got my feet moving early. I was finding the gaps easily and went on to play each ball as I saw it.         
	How he rates this innings         
	Itll be a good question to answer at the end of a game. I always rate an innings in the context of the game. From 32 for 4, at the end of the day Im really happy with what weve achieved. If we go on to win this Test match, youd say its somewhere up there. Thats why the innings Ive played at the Eden (vs Australia, 2001), in Adelaide (vs Australia, 2003) or in Rawalpindi (vs Pakistan, 2004) are memorable ... when you go on to win, thats when you realise the value. In terms of shot-making, this was a good one. It was a pretty flat wicket. Ive played on much tougher ones. If it ends up being a draw, its a great knock, but not as meaningful as some of the other ones.         
	Reaching 11,000 Test runs         
	Ive been playing for a long time. Its a nice achievement and speaks about my longevity and consistency. But for me its just a number. Its nice to be up there with people I grew up admiring. That makes it all the more special.         
	If he has sent out any message to the selectors         
	Im not even thinking about that  Im just trying to play every single game.         
	The pace of the Indian innings         
	Weve got to move on from here. We scored pretty fast and hopefully well reach 500. Theres still lot of cricket left in this match, but the way we set up our innings today (Monday) was commendable. Im still there         
	Remember Sri Lanka will have to bat last on this wicket. Weve got a platform to do well. The loss of six wickets wasnt the ideal situation, but weve moved on.         
	The decision to bat         
	It was a good toss to win. We didnt want to bat last. We know we have to bat well in the first session on the second morning. It will stay a good batting wicket for the next two days at least. Then it will turn

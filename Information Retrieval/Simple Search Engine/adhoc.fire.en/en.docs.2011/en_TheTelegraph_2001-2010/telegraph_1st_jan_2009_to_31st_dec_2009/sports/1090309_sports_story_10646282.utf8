The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australia in total control
                                                   Australia in total control
                      
	Durban: Australia opener Phillip Hughes became the youngest batsman in Test history to score a century in each innings of a Test on Sunday. The visitors are on their way to setting South Africa a huge target in the second Test. Australia ended the third day on 292 for 3, an overall lead of 506 runs, with two days left in the match.         
	Hughes, 20, whose Test career started with a four-ball duck in the first Test at the Wanderers, has since followed up with scores of 75, 115 and 136 not out. He played a more sedate innings of 301 balls on Sunday, reaping 13 fours and hitting two sixes off spinner Paul Harris. Hughess twin-century feat eclipsed the record previously held by West Indies George Headley.         
	Hughes added 164 in 48.3 overs for the second wicket with captain Ricky Ponting (81), a partnership lasting more than two sessions which took the game away from the hosts. Ponting also celebrated a notable batting achievement when he became the fourth highest run-scorer in Test cricket.

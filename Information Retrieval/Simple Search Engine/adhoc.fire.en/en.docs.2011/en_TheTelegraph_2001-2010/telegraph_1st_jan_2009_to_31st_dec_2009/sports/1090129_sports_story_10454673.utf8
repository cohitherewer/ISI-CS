                                                     Intikhabs report sealed Malik fate
    - Former captain expected to keep place in team           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Younis Khan                                 
	Calcutta: Coach Intikhab Alams damning report after the just-ended ODI series against Sri Lanka made the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) ask Shoaib Malik to step down immediately as captain or be sacked.         
	That was on Tuesday.         
	Malik, inarguably Pakistans most listless captain, obliged and has been replaced by Younis Khan, whod been the first choice for the job after the 2007 World Cup debacle.         
	Intikhab was more than merely candid in his report to the PCB chairman (Ejaz Butt) and made it clear that a change had to be effected if the teams decline was to be arrested That it couldnt be delayed, a well-placed source told The Telegraph from Lahore.         
	The source added: Intikhab is understood to have highlighted three factors: That Malik wasnt commanding respect in the dressing room, that the seniors in particular were very cut up with him and that he wasnt sharp when it came to working out and then executing strategy.         
	Basically that Malik, who started his innings in May 2007, just wasnt captaincy material.         
	Manager Yawar Saeed, it seems, didnt have anything positive to say in his report either.         
	Both Intikhab and Saeed are old hands, but had been off the circuit for some years till Butt brought them back a few months ago.         
	Apparently, and this is shocking, Malik wasnt even on talking terms with some of his players and the poor team spirit led to Pakistan being whipped by 234 runs in the final ODI, at the Gaddafi in Lahore, last Saturday.         
	Mahela Jayawardene and his men won the series 2-1.         
	According to another well-placed source, this one based in Karachi, the PCB chairman, Intikhab and chief selector Abdul Qadir had a detailed discussion with Younis before leaving Malik with no choice.         
	Younis has been known to blow hot and cold on the captaincy issue and, so, Butt and the others got his consent for the job before asking Malik to resign, the source pointed out.         
	The new captain, one learns, has given an undertaking that his cricket-related behaviour would henceforth not be dictated by emotions.         
	One expects the 31-year-old Pathan, an outstanding middle-order bat, to keep his word.         
	Besides the drama after the last World Cup, Younis had been a reluctant stand-in captain after The Oval Test fiasco, in late 2006. More recently, 13 months ago, hed been reluctant to stand in for Malik in the Bangalore Test.         
	The first challenge for Younis, who has already captained Pakistan four times in Tests (one win) and in six ODIs (two victories), would be next months Test series at home against Sri Lanka.         
	Malik, one gathers, should keep his place as a player. The same, though, cant really be said of one-time spearhead Shoaib Akhtar.         
	Shoaibs known to spring surprises, but the odds against him are massive at this point in time.         
	As Younis and the rest havent played Test cricket for all of 13 months, the PCB is planning two five-day practice matches  in Karachi and in Lahore.

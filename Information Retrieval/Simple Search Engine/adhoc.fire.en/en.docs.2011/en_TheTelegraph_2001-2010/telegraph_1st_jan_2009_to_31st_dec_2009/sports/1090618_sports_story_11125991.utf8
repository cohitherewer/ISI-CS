The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ashish Nehra grateful to friend Zaheer
                                                     Ashish Nehra grateful to friend Zaheer
            OUR BUREAU            Ashish Nehra                           
	Ashish Nehras performance in the Indian Premier League has finally paid dividends. The left-arm pacer, who along with Dirk Nannes formed a lethal strike force for the Delhi DareDevils in South Africa this year (19 wickets), on Wednesday made a return to the Indian squad after four years.         
	Im very happy I worked hard on my fitness to make a comeback, Nehra said in New Delhi.         
	He also didnt forget to thank his Delhi teammates and Zaheer Khan. The backing of my Delhi teammates in my hour of need helped me a lot Special mention should also be made of Zaheer Hes a personal friend and has encouraged me throughout to come out of my fitness woes, Nehra said.         
	Ironically, Zaheers injury has paved the way for his return to the squad for the West Indies tour.         
	After the 2003 World Cup, Nehra had his first ankle surgery. Before he had recovered fully from it, he suffered a back injury. Midway into the 2005 series in Zimbabwe, he came back home with the back injury.         
	Between 2006 and 2007 he had multiple surgeries  one on his ankle and one to repair a torn ligament.         
	He consulted doctors in Australia, South Africa and Germany (a retired practitioner who worked with the Bayern Munich Football Club and specialised in sports medicine).         
	His injuries may have come at the wrong time but Nehra, at 30, is keen to make his comeback memorable.         
	Abhishek Nayar, who earned his maiden call-up to the national team, is hoping that his all-round skills would help him get a peep into the playing XI during the one-day series in the West Indies.         
	The 25-year-old is a left-handed batsman and also bowls right-arm medium pace. He has a chance to grab the all-rounders slot left vacant by Irfan Pathans omission.         
	Of course I am eyeing the all-rounders slot. But I am open to any role that the team gives me. I want to make the most of whatever opportunity that I get and play to my potential, Nayar said.                     
	Nayar made his domestic debut in 2005 but it was after 2006 that he came into his own, both as a batsman and a bowler. My comeback into the Mumbai Ranji team three years back taught me a lot, he said.         
	Nayar has played some key knocks for Mumbai in the last couple of seasons. A superb 152 in the Mohammed Nissar Trophy match against Karachi Urban was followed up with a vital 118 in the Irani Cup in 2007-08.         
	An injury curtailed his participation in the 2008-09 season but he made his presence felt with a seven-wicket haul against Himachal Pradesh in the quarter finals and a crucial 99 in the first innings. He also shared a match-winning double century partnership with Rohit Sharma in the final against Uttar Pradesh.         
	Yet, it was the inaugural edition of the IPL that brought Nayar into the limelight.         
	The IPL (performance) will help a lot but its different (from the ODIs) Its all in the head. I just want to go out there and perform, he said.

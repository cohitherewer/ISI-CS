The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lost the plot in end overs: Dhoni
                                                                                                                                   Lost the plot in end overs: Dhoni
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hyderabad: The Indians had set up grand plans to celebrate Sachin Tendulkars 17000 runs in their dressing room. A huge cake had been ordered for. In the end, though, there was a feeling of missing out on a well-deserved victory.         
	A disappointed Sachin Tendulkar didnt turn up for the media conference. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni took his place.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On why India lost         
	We dropped three catches during the Australia innings. Then we lost quite a few wickets in the middle overs Gautam (Gambhir), Yuvraj (Singh), me... But Sachin played a superb innings. We also lost the plot in the end overs. It was more of a mental aspect than cricketing If we had managed to stop them somewhere around 330, it would have been a good score to chase.         
	If he blames it on the luck factor         
	I wouldnt blame it on luck. Were missing that finishing touch.         
	Sachins innings         
	It was a pleasure to watch him... There have been so many that its diffcult to pick one as his best. Every century is special. Personally, I am a big fan of his innings against Australia in Sharjah in 1998.         
	The positive aspect         
	Such chase always gets the team closer The way we chased 350 was good. But it also hurts when you lose games like these.         
	Ravindra Jadejas failure to stay there and pull it off         
	I wouldnt like to comment on any individual Weve to remember hes a youngster and the more he plays the more he will gain. International cricket is tough but he is doing his job. It will be unfair to compare it with T20.         
	The bowlers         
	On tracks such as today (Thursday) their performance is important because if we could manage to restrict Australia to 330 it would have made a difference.         
	When he lost hope?         
	We had hope till the last wicket fell. One man brought us back into the match and we had hope till the last over. It was a matter of one stroke.         
	If losing close matches has got to do with Indian upbringing         
	Its a broad spectre for me to make a comment. Its a matter of controlling your instincts When batting go with the momentum. What is needed at that moment is important. Paddy Upton can play a role here but at the end of the day it is up to the individual.

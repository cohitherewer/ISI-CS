	East London: Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni took his team to the top of the table with a 37-ball 58 as they beat toppers Deccan Chargers here Monday.         
	Little-known left-arm spinner Shadab Jakati took four wickets once again to complement the batsmens effort. The Chargers folded up for just 100, with only Dwayne Smith putting up a fight with a 23-ball 49.         
	Although Jakati was the most successful bowler for the Super Kings in the 78-run victory, opening bowlers Albie Morkel and Sudeep Tyagi almost won the match for their side when they reduced the Chargers to one for three in the third over.         
	After Morkel sent back Chargers skipper Adam Gilchrist with the first ball of the innings, Tyagi bowled South African Herschelle Gibbs for a duck with the second ball of the second over.         
	When Morkel had V.V.S Laxman caught by Jakati in the next over, half the job was done.         
	The 72-run fourth-wicket partnership between Smith and Rohit Sharma briefly raised hopes of a revival, but when Jakati removed Rohit in the ninth over, the mission became impossible as the Chargers do not have the firepower down the order.         
	The star of the day was Dhoni.He promoted himself up the order in a bid to regain form. The captain shared a crucial 54-run partnership for the third wicket with left-handed Suresh Raina (32), after the openers laid the platform for a decent total.         
	Chasing their third successive win, the Super Kings rode on the good performance of their top-order after opting to bat.         
	Dhoni, whose willow has been silent so far, made full use of the good start given by Matthew Hayden (43) and Murali Vijay (31), as he batted through the innings with a composed approach.         
	Raina, too, played his part with an explosive 19-ball 32, giving enough time to Dhoni to find his touch and shape the innings.         
	Dhoni raised his first half-century of this IPL in the last over when he hit RP Singh for two boundaries. His third IPL half-century came off just 37 balls, containing six boundaries and a six.         
	Hayden and Vijay gave a good start to their side, putting up 61 together, though they began in contrasting fashions. While the former Australian opener was throwing his bat at each and everything, Vijay was extremely careful with his shot selection, only going for elegant drives.         
	By the time the Super Kings crossed the 50-run mark, Hayden had hit one six each off RP, Ryan Harris and Rohit Sharma.         
	Hayden then welcomed Shoaib Maqsusi with two fours but his third attempt failed when he hit one straight to RP at point.         
	Dhoni and Vijay, going steady, took the team to 84 at the halfway mark. Vijay, who till then was depending on singles and twos, opened his shoulders after the break and hit Pragyan Ojha for a six but failed when he tried to do repeat it against T. Suman.         
	After giving his team the second breakthrough, Suman was severely punished by Raina, who hit him for two huge sixes and one four in his next over.         
	Dhoni cut loose after the 15th over and hit some really powerful shots for boundaries.           (PTI)

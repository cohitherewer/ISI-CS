The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Watson leads strong reply
                                                                                                                       7                                      Watson leads strong reply
                      
	Adelaide: Shane Watson and Simon Katich put on 174 for the first wicket in 48 overs as Australia started their reply to the West Indies 451 on a strong note, here on Saturday, the second day of the second day of the second Test.         
	Earlier, Australia-born Brendan Nash missed his second Test century by eight runs but his 68-run partnership with Ravi Rampaul, for the last wicket took the Caribbeans score from mediocre to impressive. No.11 Rampaul remained unbeaten on 40 as the Windies registered their highest score Down Under in 17 seasons, according to Cricinfo.         
	Chris Gayles men got over the euphoria, if there was any, quickly as the Australian openers started scoring at a fast pace.         
	Watson will have a restless night after finishing unbeaten on 96, an innings that he hopes will prove he has the ability to be a long-term Test opener.         
	There was frustration for Australia as the final four West Indies wickets added 178, but the hosts soon discovered that their own batsmen could use the flat surface to their advantage just as easily.         
	Katich had reached 71 by the close, having played back-up to Watsons centre-stage performance, although he did take the spotlight on one occasion when he slog-swept Sulieman Benn for six. There was no doubt that the second half of the day belonged to Watson, who struck 16 boundaries to Katichs five.         
	Meanwhile, the International Cricket Council has announced changes to the umpire appointments for the ongoing Test, says A Staff Reporter.         
	Mark Benson has withdrawn from the rest of this Test, as well as the series, due to ill health. Asad Rauf has taken over Bensons on-field duties while Bruce Oxenford has been appointed the TV umpire. Billy Bowden will join the playing control team for the final Test in Perth. The appointments for that match will be announced later.

                                                     Del Potro halts Cilic challenge
                  Juan Martin del Potro rejoices after his victory over Marin Cilic at Flushing Meadows on Thursday                     
	New York: Juan Martin del Potro overcame a sluggish start and blustery wind to defeat Marin Cilic 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-1 in the US Open quarter finals on Thursday.         
	It was sixth-seeded Del Potros first match inside Arthur Ashe Stadium, and produced his second trip to a Grand Slam semi-final. Its so beautiful playing in front of this crowd, Del Potro said. Im so happy it happened this way.         
	Jettisoned to smaller courts for every match over his two years at Flushing Meadows  despite his ranking  Del Potro finally got to play on the big stage.         
	The Argentine had a tough time handling Cilics serve in the first set, but worked it out and rolled off 17 of the last 20 games.         
	I cannot start the match like today (Thursday), Del Potro said. I was thinking about other things, and the weather was bad. But it was bad for both players. I just need to be in focus in the beginning of the match until the last point and play my game.         
	Del Potro is in his second major semi-final, following this years French Open, where he blew a lead and lost in five sets to Roger Federer.         
	What he doesnt know yet is who hell play in the semis. Thats because the quarter final between six-time major champion Rafael Nadal and 2007 Australian Open runner-up Fernando Gonzalez was postponed by showers during the second set.         
	The first rain delay, of about 75 minutes, came at 2-2 in the second set, after Nadal won the opening set in a tiebreaker. The second interruption came at about 10:20 p.m., with Nadal holding a 3-2 lead in the second-set tiebreaker.         
	At midnight, tournament officials suspended play for the night, sending Nadal and Gonzalez home.         
	Due to this rain break, the mens final is sure to be held on Monday.         
	Cilic began brilliantly, racing to a lead of a set and a break. But he started missing more and more, while Del Potro stayed steady enough to claim 17 of the last 20 games. Del Potro has been thinking about this years French Open, where he reached the semi-finals and took a 2-1 lead in sets against Federer. Del Potro let that slip away.         
	Serena Williams with sister Venus beat Alisa Kleybanova and Ekaterina Makarova 7-6 (4), 3-6, 6-2 in the womens doubles semi-finals. (AP)

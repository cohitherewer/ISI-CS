The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bob upset with ground reality
                                                   Bob upset with ground reality
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  
	New Delhi: Good grounds and good coaches will give you good players, Bob Houghton declared only a couple of days ago.         
	But it seems neither the national coachs wisdom nor the AIFFs prestige amounted to much when it came to preparing the pitch for the Nehru Cup. The playing surface at the Ambedkar Stadium, where the matches would be conducted over the next 13 days, is definitely not in the best of conditions, and all because of the lacklustre attitude of the local administration.         
	Houghton had a look at the ground on Tuesday afternoon and what he saw left him sorely disappointed.         
	The pitch was better when we played the Nehru Cup here in 2007, he said. But then, all the teams will have to play here, he added.         
	A member of the organising committee said that the Delhi governments decision to hold the Independence Day celebrations at the Ambedkar Stadium had left the pitch badly damaged.         
	The Delhi government was well aware that an international tournament would be held here. Yet they refused to cancel the Independence Day celebrations that involved parades right on the pitch, the official said.         
	When the ground was finally handed over to us, the pitch was damaged at several places.         
	We did our best to get the ground back into shape but had only three days to do so, said the official.         
	The ground belongs to the Delhi government, so we could do nothing, he said. This is the price we pay for not having our own ground.         
	The problem is that once the tournament starts the organisers would be in no position to improve the conditions. Moreover, the weathermen have predicted rains for the second half of August and that might take its toll on the ground.         
	The British coachs uncompromising attitude towards good pitches and training facilities is well known. It has ruffled quite a few feathers in the national federation in the last three years but clearly his concerns arent that widely shared.

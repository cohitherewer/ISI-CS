The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lee: CL T20 experience will help us
                                                   Lee: CL T20 experience will help us
                                  
	Hyderabad: Australian players experience of playing in the inaugural Champions League Twenty20 would held the visitors in good stead in the seven-match one-day International series against India, feels speedster Brett Lee.         
	Lee is one of the five members of the Australian squad, who played in the Twenty20 tournament which concluded in Hyderabad Friday night.         
	Apart from Lee, Peter Siddle, Doug Bollinger, Nathan Hauritz, Cameron White and Jon Holland are the other players who had a feel about the Indian conditions during the Champions League.         
	I am looking forward to play the series. It is going to be a huge challenge to play against the super stars of India in front of their home crowd, Lee said after powering NSW Blues to the inaugural CLT20 title Friday.         
	But the experience I and other players have had on these wickets during the tournament, I hope it will keep us in good stead. Hopefully, this experience will helps us in the forthcoming seven ODIs, he said.         
	NSW Blues were in tatters before Lees 31-ball 48 powered them to a competitive 159 for nine and then the tearaway pacer returned to claim two early wickets to help his side beat Trinidad amp; Tobago by 41 runs in the Champions Trophy T20 final.         
	Lee, however, refused to predict any favourites for the high-profile series, saying, We will be giving our best to win but I dont want to make any prediction. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB seeks legal help 
                                                   PCB seeks legal help 
                      
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) have mounted a legal challenge to the International Cricket Councils (ICC) decision to strip the country of the right to host World Cup 2011 matches.         
	The ICC didnt consult us before taking this decision. We have sent them a legal notice, PCB chairman Ejaz Butt said on Saturday.         
	We dont think the ICC decision is sound on legal grounds.         
	If they say the security situation in Pakistan prompted this decision then the security situation in India and Sri Lanka is also not good, Butt said.         
	He said the PCB would try to get a restraining order against the ICC, who announced last month that they were moving the matches from Pakistan due to security reasons. (agencies)

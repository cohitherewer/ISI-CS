The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Toss was crucial: Yuvraj
                                                   Toss was crucial: Yuvraj
            OUR BUREAU                      
	The Kings XI Punjab captain Yuvraj Singh said that winning the toss was a crucial factor in their victory against the Delhi DareDevils on Friday.               
	The following are excerpts               
	YUVRAJ: Im happy with the win and the crucial points... We batted and bowled well against the DareDevils. But the toss today (Friday) was extremely important. I wasnt too sure as what should be the ideal total on this pitch. The bowlers did an excellent job by picking up wickets at the right time to restrict the DareDevils to 120. Brett (Lee) was fantastic and was ably assisted by Sreesanth. I thought 120-140 was always chaseable. We are a bit worried with Mahela Jayawardenes injury, and hopefully well be able to field our best side in the next match.         
	VIRENDER SEHWAG: We didnt bat well at all. Our bowlers were brilliant though Ashish (Nehera) was good. At one stage, we were very much in the game. But we certainly didnt have enough runs on the board to defend. Also, their batsmen, Kumar (Sangakkara) and Irfan (Pathan), batted well. The only way we could win was to get them out and we couldnt do that Twenty20 is a bad type of cricket. Once you start to lose in this format of the game, you just cant recover and keep losing... I certainly dont want that to happen for my team. We have to regroup and focus on the next match.

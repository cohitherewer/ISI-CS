                                                                                                               Antonios designs Set Alights Waterloo 
            PRAVESH GUPTA                            
	Mumbai: Trainer S.S. Shah waved his magic wand again, on Sunday, in the McDowell Signature Indian Derby, which his less-fancied runner, Antonios, won from the half-money favourite Set Alight, hitherto unconquered in her career in 10 starts.          
	The 29-year-old Brazilian jockey Sylvester A. De Sousa, presently stationed in UK, was asked to air dash to the city, because of the unavailability of Mic Kinane who had helped Shah win last years Indian Derby on Hotstepper.          
	It was a fast run race and it hardly came as a surprise when the course record over the Derby trip was eclipsed by nearly 1.8 seconds. Earlier, in a Class III race, the winners timing over the similar trip was barely 1.5 second outside the course record.          
	There was no hard-luck story in the race as Set Alight was always in a striking position behind Go Guzzi Go and Telstar till the field approached the home turn. Taking off from that point, the Razeen daughter appeared to be cruising, but Antonios struck to the eighth berth till the final turn, switched course on the wide out and devoured ground in the open.          
	It was apparent in the last 150m that the filly was tiring and the winner, the colt, was growing stronger. The inevitable happened in the final 50m as a loud disappointing hoo greeted the winner by a massive crowd, which not only braved the April heat and the sultry condition but also had to witness their darling filly meeting her Waterloo.          
	The Bangalore challenger, Icebreaker, finished third, justifying her trainer S. Padmanabhans observation that filly Icebreaker was not pushed in the Oaks, which she lost, to Riyasat and Nora.          
	Set Alights owner and the UB Group supremo, Vijay Mallya, was conspicuous by his absence at the prize distribution ceremony. The RWITCs chairman, Vivek Jain, gave away the prizes. Mallya was, however, spotted in the racecourse until the time the Derby field was flagged off. One wonders if his absence had anything to do with the defeat of Set Alight.          
	Trainer A. Hussains equally hot property, Star Crowned, claimed added attraction in the 10-event card, the B.K. Rattonsey Memorial Maiden Multi-Million, sponsored by connections of the Derby winners. Jockey Y. Srinath, however, kept the half-money favourite far too back and for far too long. Once set in motion, 150m from home, the Placerville daughter chewed them up all.

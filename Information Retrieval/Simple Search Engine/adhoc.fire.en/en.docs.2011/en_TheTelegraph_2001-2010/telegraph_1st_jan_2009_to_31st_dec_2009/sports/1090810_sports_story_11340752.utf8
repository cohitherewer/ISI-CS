The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev Milkha slides to tied 49th 
                                                     Jeev Milkha slides to tied 49th 
          
	Akron (US): Jeev Milkha Singh could not arrest his gradual slide down the leaderboard and the Indian pro was at tied 49th after going two-over 72 in his penultimate round of the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational golf tournament here.         
	There was an unmistakable pattern in his cards in the last three days and Jeev joined three others, including his playing partner for the last two rounds Ernie Els, at three-over 213 after rounds of 70, 71 and 72 at the Firestone Country Club.         
	After six holes of glitch-free journey, Jeev had a bumpy ride as he bogeyed the seventh and eighth holes to go two-over at the turn.         
	On his way back, Jeev double-bogeyed the par-four 11th hole to go four-over. Birdies on the 15th and 16th holes were clearly not enough a damage control exercise as Jeev settled for a card of 72.         
	Meanwhile, Padraig Harrington and six-times champion Tiger Woods set up a mouth-watering last-day duel with electrifying displays on the back nine in Saturdays third round.         
	Overnight leader Harrington reeled off four birdies in six holes from the 12th on the way to a three-under-par 67 at a rain-softened Firestone Country Club, stretching his advantage to three strokes.         
	Although the Irishman briefly faltered with a bogey at the par-five 16th where he duffed his fourth shot from a greenside bunker, he drained a 19-footer on the 17th green to finish at 10-under 200.         
	Harrington is bidding to win his first title on either the PGA or European tours since last years PGA Championship at Oakland Hills.         
	Woods, seeking his fifth PGA Tour victory of the year on one of his favourite layouts, birdied four of the last six holes for a superb 65, matching the best score of the day.

                                                   You need luck, not brains, to captain in T20: Ranatunga
    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  Lankas World Cup-winning captain on the semi-final vs WI             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  
	London: Arjuna Ranatunga, Sri Lankas only World Cup-winning captain who is now a Member of Parliament, spoke to The Telegraph here on Thursday afternoon.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q Your thoughts on the eve of Fridays Sri Lanka-West Indies semi-final?         
	A Well, T20 is such that any team can win... Its difficult to predict and it may so happen that an unbeaten team could have one bad day and that could turn out to be a semi-final or final... I hope that doesnt happen to us... The Oval will have more pace and bounce and, so, the West Indies must be fancying their chances.         
	Is it significant that Sri Lanka beat the West Indies in the group stage?         
	But (Chris) Gayle didnt play that match in Nottingham... More than the past, the manner in which the days pressure is handled will make the real difference. (After a pause) Im worried about the law of averages... Ill be keeping fingers crossed.         
	What is Sri Lankas USP?         
	Great bowling and smart fielding... Of course I remain a little concerned over our batting... Either Sanath (Jayasuriya) or (Tillekaratne) Dilshan will have to fire for us to reach 150-plus... Bowling is our strength and the three Ms  (Lasith) Malinga, (Muttiah) Muralidharan, (Ajantha) Mendis  control 12 of the 20 overs, which is a big percentage.         
	Sri Lankas weakness...         
	The one shortcoming is that we dont have power hitters in the middle order... (Kumar) Sangakkara and Mahela (Jayawardene) can get you one or one-and-a-half runs per ball, but not two... The Indians, on the other hand, had that ability.         
	Whats the West Indies strength?         
	If Gayle gets going himself, he wont need the other 10 to help out... So, hes their biggest strength... Having said that, Gayle doesnt play the spinners well and Im not sure about his ability to handle Mendis... Fidel Edwards is effective, but theres a question mark over his fitness...         
	Would you start with Mendis at one end?         
	Probably with Dilshan and (left-arm quick) Isuru Udana.         
	The West Indies weakness?         
	That they dont play the spinners well.         
	Did you expect the West Indies to make the semi-finals?         
	No... Id thought four from the following  South Africa, India, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Pakistan  would make it.         
	Your advice to Sangakkara?         
	(Laughs) To continue playing positively... It should be fine as long as our players dont start taking in the pressure.         
	Has Sangakkaras captaincy impressed you?         
	You need luck, not brains, to captain in T20... Indeed, you dont have to be a thinker and its not necessary to be creative. Where Im concerned, T20 isnt proper cricket... If T20 becomes the yardstick for judging players, then Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar wont be Indias greatest in the past three decades... That honour would probably go to Yuvraj Singh and Yusuf Pathan.         
	Youre in a minority... Most administrators are now swearing only by T20...         
	Ill be interested to see how many players make themselves available for a T20 series where charity is the motive, say raising funds for the famished in Africa... Id like to see just how many turn up if theres no monetary incentive...         
	Gary Kirsten, the Team India coach, has cited the IPL-induced fatigue as one of the reasons for the poor show in the World T20. Your take?         
	Im surprised that the Board of Control for Cricket in India gave more importance to a private venture which has its support... In fact, I find it unbelievable... Preparing for the World T20 shouldve been the priority instead of counting millions and billions of dollars... For a team to click, it needs to both prepare as one and perform as a team... Im sure every Indian player tried his best, played his heart out, but the mind and the body didnt respond... I have sympathy for them, its the Board which sacrificed national interest by scheduling the IPL so close to the World T20... Money is important, yes, but it shouldnt eventually kill cricket... A big worry is that people whove never played the game are the ones calling the shots in quite a few Boards.         
	Jayasuriya turns 40 in less than a fortnight. Have you seen a more remarkable cricketer?         
	He has a large heart and has worked hard on his fitness... One has to admire him... I dont, however, agree with the popular belief that T20 is for the younger lot. After all, the fielding is limited to 20 overs and those whore 35-40 years old can manage that.         
	Should Jayasuriya play till the 2011 (50-over) World Cup?         
	He has to decide... Nobody else can take that decision for him...         
	The last one: You arent fond of T20, but what makes the difference in that form?         
	Power hitters... Also, bowlers who can take wickets in the early overs.

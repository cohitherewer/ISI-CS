The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Md. Sp. go down 0-3 to Mumbai FC 
                                                     Md. Sp. go down 0-3 to Mumbai FC 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Kulothungan                           
	Mumbai: Mohammedan Sportings I-League fortunes plunged further after they received a 3-0 mauling at the hands of Mumbai FC at the Cooperage here on Tuesday.         
	Goals from Riston Rodrigues and Kulothungan put the hosts 2-0 ahead in the first half and India player Abhishek Yadav extended the margin with a 73rd minute strike.         
	Debutants Mumbai FC, who now have 19 points from 11 games at the end of the first leg (the tie was scheduled for November 28 but was postponed due to terror strikes in the city), are placed fourth on the league table after the win.         
	Mohammedan Sporting remain second from bottom and need to lift their game drastically in the second leg, which begins on Friday, to avoid relegation.         
	However, it was the Calcutta club that had the upper hand in the first 15 minutes or so of the match. With Tokunbo Adebayo as the fulcrum, the defence and midfield blocked any moves created by Mumbai FC.         
	Home coach David Booth, finding that his 4-4-2 combination was being ineffective, responded with an early substitution, replacing K. Aseem with Abhishek Yadav.         
	The gameplan now changed to a 4-3-3 with Abel Hammond and Kulothungan closing down from the left and right flanks respectively with Yadav playing as a central attacking midfielder. That also released Felix Aboagye to play upfront, and the African began to feed the trio continuously.         
	This changed the complexion of the game but, sadly, Mohammedan seemed to have no Plan B.         
	More agonising, however, was the way the goals were conceded. The first sign of things in store came in the 33rd minute when custodian Naseem Akhtar fumbled on a floater from Mumbai FC captain Sanjay Parte.         
	Two minutes later, Rodrigues found enough room in the penalty area to shoot a right footer into the net. That was followed by another nightmarish marking error when, with a minute to go for the break, Hammond headed down Partes free kick for Kulothungan to push it in easily.         
	Mohammedan showed some urgency upon resumption but they kept losing the ball. And the defence continued to disintegrate, making any forward move nearly impossible. Akhtar was the culprit when he came up with a weak deflection to thwart Hammonds cross only to set up a sitter for Abhishek.         
	There were a couple of chances in the closing stages of the game when Mumbai FC, with an eye on the Friday clash against Mohun Bagan, were making changes. But that there was not a single shot on goal from the Calcutta side in the whole game summed up Mohammedans performance.

                                                   UP stay in hunt
                      
	Nagpur: Shivkant Shukla (103) and Parvinder Singh (93) shared an unbeaten 190-run stand to lead Uttar Pradeshs (UP) fightback in the Ranji Trophy semi-final against Tamil Nadu on Tuesday.         
	The duo took the score to 253 for three on the penultimate day of the four-day Ranji Trophy semi-final match against Tamil Nadu.         
	It was a day of hard toil for the Tamil Nadu bowlers as Uttar Pradesh batsmen added 228 runs from 90 overs, losing just two wickets in the process. UP have thus reduced their first innings deficit to 192 runs.         
	Opener Shukla (103) struck the third century of his first-class career and his second of the season. Parvinder, on the other hand, is seven runs short of a well-deserved hundred.         
	Resuming at 25 for one, Shukla stood rock-solid even though UP slumped to 63 for three following the early exits of his two reputed colleagues Suresh Raina (39) and skipper Md Kaif (0), both of whom fell to Laxmipathy Balaji.         
	BRIEF SCORES: Tamil Nadu 445. Uttar Pradesh 253/3 (S. Shukla batting 103, P. Singh batting 93). Match to continue.           (PTI)

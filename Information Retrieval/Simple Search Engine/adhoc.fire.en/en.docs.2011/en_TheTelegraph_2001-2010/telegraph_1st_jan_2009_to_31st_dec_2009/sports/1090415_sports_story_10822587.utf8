	Hyderabad: V. V. S. Laxman rates current India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni as the best, saying he is calm and exudes a lot of confidence.         
	Dhoni is one of the best captains I played under, said Laxman on Tuesday. The stylish Hyderabad batsman made his debut when Sachin Tendulkar was the captain, and has also played under the leadership of Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble.         
	Dhoni is so calm and composed. He exudes a lot of confidence. Its a great feeling to play under him, he said.         
	The 34-year-old right-hander also lauded opener Gautam Gambhir, who played a significant role in the Test series win over New Zealand.           (PTI)

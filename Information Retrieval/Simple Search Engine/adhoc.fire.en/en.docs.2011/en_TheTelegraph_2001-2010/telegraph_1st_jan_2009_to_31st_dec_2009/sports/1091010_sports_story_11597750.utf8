            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            New South Wales captain Simon Katich pulls against Diamond Eagles, at the Kotla on Friday                           
	New Delhi: Fridays first Champions League T20 match at the Kotla was devoid of excitement, on the field and off it.         
	On the pitch, it was far from an even contest as the mighty New South Wales Blues steamrollered South Africas Diamond Eagles by 53 runs. Off the field, there were hardly 5,000 spectators in the stands despite freely distributed complimentary passes to fill the galleries.         
	Yet for those who love to watch the skill of batsmanship it remained an entertaining evening as the New South Wales skipper Simon Katich slammed a flawless 41-ball 53 to turn the match in the Australians favour.         
	Katich played with authority, although the pitch clearly wasnt easy to bat on, to take New South Wales to 144 for 6, a score that the South Africans couldnt overhaul. The Eagles could only reach 91 for nine, the lowest score in a T20 match at the Kotla. It would have been even lower had Ryan McLaren not struck a timely 40.         
	Katich was a treat to watch as he relied more on timing than force. He took three fours in a single over off Dillon du Preez directing the balls to the boundary with superb wristwork and neat placement.         
	It might be a youngsters game but experience does count, said the 34-year-old Katich. If you look at the IPL this time, experienced batsmen like Matthew Hayden, Adam Gilchrist and Rahul Dravid were successful on the bouncy tracks of South Africa.         
	Adaptability will be key on these tracks, warned the victorious skipper. It was a low track. We knew around 150 would be enough to win the match.         
	That the track was far from satisfactory was echoed, albeit more strongly, by Eagles captain Boeta Dippenaar: I must say the conditions were really tough. The bounce wasnt great, particularly when you are coming from lively South African conditions. The wicket wasnt close to what we have played in the three practice games.         
	It wouldnt be right to say that Katich alone was the architect of the New South Wales victory. The Australians have a well-balanced bowling attack, spearheaded by Brett Lee and backed up by an accurate Stuart Clark, who had the Eagles on their knees from the start.         
	While Lee triggered the downfall, when he had Relee Roussow trapped leg before through sheer pace and accuracy, Clark was the wrecker in chief with three wickets.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni: It was funny, fishy
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dhoni: It was funny, fishy
            A CORRESPONDENT            Virender Sehwag in a belligerent mood in Mohali on Saturday. (PTI)                           
	Mohali: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni expressed disappointment at his sides sloppy fielding Saturday but observed that there was something funny and fishy about the second T20 International here as he said that even Sri Lanka were not at their best in that department.         
	Had we taken those catches, the Sri Lankan scoreboard would have been different. We would not have to chase down 200-plus Its a big total, Dhoni said after India thrashed the visitors by six wickets to level the T20 series at 1-1.         
	There was something funny and fishy! Sri Lanka also dropped catches and missed run out chances. It may be the crowd, the ground or the light But any cricketer at this level should have taken those catches, he added.         
	Dhoni said the difference between the Indian performance in Nagpur, in the first T20, and here was that every batsman found the rhythm soon after one was out.         
	It was a good batting track and Virender Sehwag gave us a good platform. But the important thing was that the ones who came after that settled in quickly. When Gambhir was out, I kept up the pace and when Sehwag was dismissed, Yuvraj scored at a brisk pace, said the Indian captain.         
	Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara conceded that his side did not take the chances that came their way, but gave credit to the Indian batsmen for their fine show.         
	Two hundred-plus was a big score. I thought 206 was a winning total. The dropped catches and the missed run out chances cost us dear. But we played well. Sehwag started well and then Dhoni and Yuvraj finished the game, he said.         
	Birthday boy and Man of the Match Yuvraj termed his Saturdays innings as his best in India colours.         
	Todays innings is the best. I am happy that I could do well in front of my home crowd. The track was good In fact, better than Nagpur, said Yuvraj.         
	But he dismissed any birthday celebrations, saying, No party tonight!

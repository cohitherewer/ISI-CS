    - Younis Khan hopes for a final against team india             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni                                 
	London: For the second time in recent days, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Younis Khan crossed each other, on Thursday evening.         
	Their first meeting was at The Oval, where India and Pakistan played a warm-up match. This time, it was at the MCCs Indoor Centre at Lords.         
	Younis had just finished his session with the media, Dhoni was to begin his. All the best bhai, the Pakistan captain wished his counterpart. Dhoni shook hands, saying to you too.         
	India and Pakistan arent playing each other in the World T20 on Friday, but the 2007 finalists are launching their campaign on the same day. Pakistan versus a solid Sri Lanka, champions India against the temperamental West Indies.         
	Both need a strong start if Youniss wish, of an India-Pakistan final, is to materialise.         
	Dhoni, of course, isnt looking as far ahead as June 21 when Lords will stage yet another mega decider.         
	Right now, Im looking at tomorrow, then the next match (versus England on Sunday) and the one after that (against South Africa on Tuesday)... Pehle ek-ek match jeetna hai (before talking of the semi-finals and beyond), Dhoni told The Telegraph.                 Younis Khan   
	The captains approach is quite clear.         
	In a refreshing change from the happenings at Trent Bridge, Dhonis interaction with the media went off smoothly. In fact, at one point, he accepted that he had changed over the last couple of years.         
	Changes are there... Some good, some bad... Its not easy to judge myself, Ill have to go by the feedback... Being a human being, there will be shortcomings, Dhoni stated.         
	Its rarely that the captain speaks about himself, but when he does, theres little hidden. Indeed, its pretty much dil se stuff.         
	For India, the business end of the World T20 begins in a few hours, but Dhoni didnt seem to be under pressure. He even joked.         
	For example, when a Chris Gayle-specific question was asked, Dhoni replied with tongue close to cheek: Theres no need to plan too many things, for one cant have fielders outside the boundary! Gayles a big six hitter and if somebody like him has his day, then youll end up on the losing side.         
	A billion and more will be praying that the West Indies captain (expected to take the field after resting for one match) is snared at the earliest.         
	The India XI wasnt announced, but Dhoni more or less confirmed that both specialist spinners (Harbhajan Singh, Pragyan Ojha) would again play.         
	Weve been giving our best in every match, irrespective of the opposition, so I wouldnt say well have to go one step up in the Super Eights... I dont expect easy matches and if that happens, then it would mean weve played really well... Theres more pressure in the bigger matches, so coping with that is important, Dhoni maintained.         
	Asked what made him go with Rohit Sharma as the second opener, following Virender Sehwags non-availability, the captain answered: His natural talent and form... The options were Yusuf Pathan, Ravindra Jadeja and myself... Fortunately, Sehwag is injured, otherwise picking the XI would have been a problem  who to leave out?         
	Dhoni, by the way, placed on record the difference Sehwag makes (puts pressure on the bowlers and dismantles the attack...).         
	Indias match: 10 pm (IST).

	Petaling Jaya (Malaysia): Indian golfing sensation Gaganjeet Bullar is eyeing his second Asian Tour title in the Selangor Masters starting here on Wednesday.         
	On a high after his breakthrough triumph in the Indonesia President Invitational two weeks ago and a play-off loss in Brunei on Sunday, the 21-year-old Indian leapfrogged to the seventh place in Asian Tour Order of Merit and is now eyeing his second title on the challenging Seri Selangor layout.         
	I have been hitting the ball really well and putting well these past few weeks and my experience on the Asian Tour has certainly developed my skills, said the Kapurthala pro.         
	Bhullar said his recent success has lifted his morale and he feels he belongs to the top level.         
	My confidence level has changed so much and I like this golf course and feel I can play well here, said Bhullar.         
	The strapping Indian knows mastering the Seri Selangor Golf Club layout would not be easy but Bhullar felt things would be under control as long as his approach shots fall in place.         
	Its a really good test as there are a lot of holes where you need to hit good shots into the greens, he said.         
	Local favourite and defending champion Ben Leong also sounded wary of the tricky green and said a golfer would have to be precise with his approach shot.         
	Im comfortable on this course. To shoot a good score here, you have to put the ball in play and avoid the three putts because the greens are really quick and tricky, Leong said.         
	Bhullar and Leong will come up against a top field in the $ 300,000 Asian Tour event which includes last weeks Brunei Open champion Darren Beck of Australia, Korean Noh Seung-yul, Thailands Prom Meesawat and Singaporean Mardan Mamat.

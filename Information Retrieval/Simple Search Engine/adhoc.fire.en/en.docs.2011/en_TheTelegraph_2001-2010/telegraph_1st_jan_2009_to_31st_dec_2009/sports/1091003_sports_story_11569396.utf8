The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United start as firm favourites
                                                   United start as firm favourites
                      
	London: Defending champions Manchester United are confident of beating Sunderland at home and stretching their English Premier League and Cup winning streak to nine.         
	United face Sunderland without Michael Owen, who went off after only 20 minutes of Wednesdays Champions League 2-1 victory over Wolfsburg with a recurrence of a groin strain.         
	That means United will probably field Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov up front against a Sunderland side which is going well under former United defender Steve Bruce. Sunderland strikers Darren Bent and Kenwyne Jones have scored 10 league goals between them.         
	Fourth place Tottenham, who are also three points behind United, visit lowly Bolton and Manchester City, level with Spurs but with a game in hand on the teams above, is not in action until Monday, when they visit seventh-place Aston Villa.         
	Last place Portsmouth, who have lost their first seven games, hope to pick up the clubs first points at Wolves.         
	Meanwhile, Sulaiman al-Fahims admission to a Dubai hospital for an operation to remove kidney stones could delay further the financial stabilisation of Portsmouth.         
	The 32-year-old property tycoon, who completed his takeover of the troubled Premier League club last month, was admitted to hospital late on Thursday and is likely to spend several days recuperating.

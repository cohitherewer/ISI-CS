            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Abhinav Lohan carded a one-under 71 to take the lead at the end of the first round in the LG Goodricke Eastern India Strokeplay golf tournament at the RCGC Monday.         
	The strokeplay event, to be played over two days, will also be used to determine the seedings for the matchplay tournament that gets underway on Wednesday.         
	Lohan is now one stroke ahead of a three-man chasing pack, which includes the Delhi duo of Gagan Verma and Saurabh Bahuguna, along with local lad Sher Ali Mollah.         
	Seven players, including Rashid Khan, shared the fifth place at one-over 73.         
	There will be a playoff for the first and the 32nd place.         
	Lohan almost didnt play due to viral fever but after taking a strong dose of medicine, the youngster held on to return the best card of the day.         
	The tournament is the ninth leg of the Tour and points earned from each leg will give the players a chance to play in the 2010 Asian Games and Asian Amateur meet. As of now, Rashid Khan looks certain to make the squads.

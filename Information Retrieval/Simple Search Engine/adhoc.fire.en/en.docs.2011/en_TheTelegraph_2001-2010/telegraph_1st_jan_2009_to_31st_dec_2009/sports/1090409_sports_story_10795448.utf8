	Calcutta: Team India openers Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag moved in opposite directions in the International Cricket Council (ICC) Player Rankings for Test batsmen after their contrasting performances against New Zealand in the recently concluded third Test in Wellington.         
	According to an ICC release, Gambhir has risen one place to achieve his career-best fourth rank.         
	The 27-year-old southpaw has climbed five places in the series after contributing 445 runs including two centuries and a half-century. Gambhir in the last eight Tests has scored 1,269 runs and has vaulted 33 places in the rankings.                     
	Sehwag, on the other hand has dropped three places to 20th position. The 30-year-old Delhi batsman, who started the series in 14th, has lost six places after scoring just 140 runs in five innings.         
	Besides Sehwag, V.V.S. Laxman has also slipped one place to 16th position while captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has jumped five places to share 31st spot with Englands Ian Bell. Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid have retained their 14th and 26th positions respectively.                   
	Meanwhile, Zaheer Khan has climbed two places to 12th position in the Test bowlers rankings.         
	His new-ball partner Ishant Sharma however, has slipped out of the top 20 after claiming just one wicket in Wellington.         
	Sharma, who rose to a career-best 17th position after the second Test in Napier, has dropped five places to 22nd position.

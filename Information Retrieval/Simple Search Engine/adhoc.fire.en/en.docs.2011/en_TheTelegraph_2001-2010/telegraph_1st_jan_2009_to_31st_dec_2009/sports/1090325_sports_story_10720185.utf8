The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Decision comes as a relief 
                                                   Decision comes as a relief 
                      
	New Delhi: The Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises were relieved on Tuesday after it was decided that the Twenty20 event would be held in South Africa. They were happy that the event was finally taking place, defying all odds, and that it was better than not having it at all.         
	A Kolkata Knight Riders spokesman, however, did not wish to react. The following are the other reactions (alphabetically):         
	Nita Ambani (co-owner, Mumbai Indians): Mumbai Indians will miss the excitement of playing in our home ground (Mumbai) and in India. However, under the limitations of the present circumstances, we are taking the unexpected turn of events positively and believe that it will add an exciting new facet to IPL. We are happy with the decision to play the second season of IPL in South Africa. The entire team of Mumbai Indians is gearing up to meet a different set of challenges and keenly look forward to the start of the edition.         
	Ranjit Borthakur (vice-chairman, Rajasthan Royals): Its disappointing that the event is not taking place in India. But if there was a choice between no tournament and a tournament outside India, it was always the latter. There is this great Indian dream.         
	Vijay Mallya (owner, Bangalore Royal Challengers): I would have preferred England to South Africa. You could have taken one good flight from 5-6 places in India to England and it would have been cheaper. Besides, an average Englishman loves his cricket. The stands there would have been full of crowd. I guess weather conditions clinches the issue for South Africa. In England, there were chances that matches would have been rained off. So though travelling to South Africa would be more difficult and costlier, I think there are a lot of Indians there, especially in Durban. Besides, I have five South Africans in my team and I hope the people there too come out and support.         
	Amrit Mathur (chief operating officer, Delhi DareDevils): We are very happy and with the clarity on venues, we can proceed to make the necessary arrangements. We have a strong relationship with the sponsors and so I think that they would be happy too.         
	Muttiah Muralidharan (player, Chennai Super Kings): Its disappointing because we would have played in front of the home crowd and I guess it would not be the same this year. But at the same time the game must go on, else cricket would die. This is the right decision. Ive toured India many times, on personal tours as well and I never had any security concern. But I think because of the upcoming elections, people seemed wary of security.         
	Shaun Pollock (mentor-cum-adviser, Mumbai Indians): Its a huge tournament and I think South Africa is ready to host the event. The domestic season has finished, the stadiums are empty, practice facilities are available and the weather is going to be perfect. I doubt if South Africa would be able to get as big crowds as we saw last year in India. But people here love Twenty20 and appreciate world class players. Im sure they will come out in numbers.         
	Ness Wadia (co-owner, Kings XI Punjab): To be honest, I didnt have much preference. I have been to South Africa and its a wonderful country with lot of support for cricket and India. Either of the two would have been good. It would give us more time for Yuvraj (Singh), (Kumar) Sangakkara and Mahela (Jayawardene) to be free from national duty and join the squad.

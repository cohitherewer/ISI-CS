            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  
	New Delhi: The Union minister for sports, MS Gill on Monday said that the current Indian football team could be beaten by the Australian school team.         
	Speaking during the felicitation function of the 1956 Olympic team, the minister said: When I was a kid, I went with my father to watch the India versus Iran Asian Games final here in 1951. It was a memorable day for me as Mewalal scored a fine goal and India won the gold medal.         
	With the All India Football Federation (AIFF) general secretary, Alberto Colaco and host of officials from the Sports Authority of India (SAI) sitting around, Gill did not stop here and said he felt sad about the current status of the Indian team at the international level.         
	Sometimes the team is ranked 140  sometimes 120. I dont know what has happened to Indian football. Now, they may even get beaten by the Australian school team.         
	The sports minister, who put football back into the list of priority sports immediately after he assumed office, heaped praises on the 1956 Olympic team that finished fourth in Melbourne.         
	So much so, that at the end of the function Gills said: You were great players and great heroes. Even now, you may beat the present Indian team by two goals.         
	At a simple function, attended by seven members of the 1956 team, Gill presented each of the former stars with a memento and a cheque of Rs. 1.50 lakh. One minute silence was observed in memory of the nine footballers of the 18-member squad who have already passed away.         
	The skipper of the team, Samar (Badru) Banerjee, who spoke on behalf of the footballers, said he and his colleagues were overwhelmed by the gesture.

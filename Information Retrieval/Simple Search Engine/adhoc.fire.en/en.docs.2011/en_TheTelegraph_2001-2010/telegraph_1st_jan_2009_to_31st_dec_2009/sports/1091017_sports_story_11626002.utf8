The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Victoria look to consolidate
                                                   Victoria look to consolidate
                      
	Bangalore: Virtually through to the semis with a comprehensive win over the Royal Challengers Bangalore Thursday, the Victoria Bushrangers would look to consolidate their position when they take on the Cape Cobras in the Champions League T20 Saturday.         
	Victoria put up an all-round performance to overcome the Bangalore team by seven wickets and would confirm their berth in the last-four if they defeat the South Africans in the League B encounter.         
	On the other hand, Cobras, who made the Super Eight by virtue of being the Group C toppers, would like to maintain their run in the 12-team event.         
	Skipper Andrew Puttick, who figures second on the list of the tournaments leading scorers, would be the mainstay of the Cobras batting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gayle gives WI the upper hand
                                                                                                                       7                                        Gayle gives WI the upper hand
                  Chris Gayle                     
	Adelaide: The second Test between Australia and the West Indies took an interesting turn Monday as the visitors built a sizeable 296-run lead on the fourth day. Captain Chris Gayles unbeaten 155 made it possible.         
	Gayles first Test hundred against Australia gave the Caribbeans the handsome lead with a day to play. On a turning pitch, Australia will have their task cut out against the spin and bounce of Sulieman Benn.         
	In the past century, no team had been able to score more than 239 in the fourth innings to win a Test here, and if Gayle does not declare overnight, Australia might need to beat the all-time record of 315 to win the match. The visitors finished the day at 284 for eight, with Gayle and Ravi Rampaul at the crease, according to Cricinfo.         
	A draw remains the most likely result, especially with the possibility of some final-day showers, but Gayle at least significantly slashed the odds of West Indies going 0-2 down with one match to play. Following Australias innings victory inside three days in Brisbane, a draw would be a welcome result for Gayle amp; Co.         
	Dwayne Bravo, Brendan Nash, Benn and Kemar Roach have all stood up in Adelaide, and on the fourth day, it was the captains turn to lead from the front.         
	Meanwhile, Australia pacer Doug Bollinger has been reprimanded for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct during the fourth days play.         
	Bollinger was charged with a Level 1 offence, contrary to Section 2.1.3 of the code, which relates to showing dissent at an umpires decision.

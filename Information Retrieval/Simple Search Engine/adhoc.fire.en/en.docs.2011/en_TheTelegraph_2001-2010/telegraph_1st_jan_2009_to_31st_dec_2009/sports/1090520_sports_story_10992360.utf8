                                                     Brendon: Mood is fantastic
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Brad Hodge and Brendon McCullum during the Knight Riders match on Monday                           
	Centurion: The day no one gave them a chance, the Kolkata Knight Riders came from nowhere and gunned down one of the tournament favourites the Chennai Super Kings here in SuperSport Park on Monday. Captain Brendon McCullum, whose 48-ball 81 laid the platform for the 7-wicket victory, smiled more than he has done for the last four weeks and spoke about the payback win at the post-match press conference.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Finally you are smiling. It must have been a great moment         
	Yeah, I guess, but the irony is that this was probably our worst bowling and fielding performance in the whole tournament. But the mood in the change room at the moment is just fantastic. I am so pleased for the guys. Its been a hell of a ride in the last three or four weeks. We have got ourselves in situations where we thought we couldnt lose games but we have managed to come up short. I am so pleased for the change room and for all the guys who have continually given their all for the team. Its nice to get some reward as we did tonight.               
	I guess them scoring almost 190 let us play freely at the top. We tried to get our run rate up so that we could keep things in check as we headed for the last five or six overs. As it worked out, it became the perfect run chase. Brad Hodge was outstanding hes been great for us the whole tournament.                     
	Did you do anything different today?         
	We batted second for a start. We have had some pretty good totals to defend in the last couple of games. We havent probably executed with the ball as much as we should have and we have dropped a few catches which have let us down. With the bat in hand it was a different proposition for us and it was quite a refreshing proposition. It certainly worked for us.         
	After this win, do you have a message the Knight Riders millions of supporters back home who expected you to go on and win the tournament?         
	I guess its the same message we have been telling one other within the camp. Hopefully this is some small sort of payback for all the hard work and dedication that not only the players but also the people from outside the group, all the fans, have shown. The emotion you saw at the end from the guys is something we are trying to recapture next year. We still got a fantastic fan base and the guys have been great with their messages from all over the world.         
	Has the congratulation message from Shah Rukh Khan arrived yet?         
	Not so far. But no doubt he will be in contact tonight. He has been in contact after almost every game. He lives and breathes this team more than anyone else. I am sure he will be sitting at home quietly, pleased with the way things unfolded.

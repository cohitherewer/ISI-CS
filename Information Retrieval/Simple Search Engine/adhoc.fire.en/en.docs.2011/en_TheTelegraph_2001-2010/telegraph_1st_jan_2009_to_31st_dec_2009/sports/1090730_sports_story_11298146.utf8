The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Roger keen to play in Davis Cup
                                                   Roger keen to play in Davis Cup
                      
	Geneva: Roger Federer wants to play in Switzerlands Davis Cup playoff against Italy in September, team captain Severin Luethi said Wednesday.         
	Nothing is definite yet but theres a good chance that our best players will be there, Luethi said in Wednesdays edition of Lausanne-based daily Le Matin. I have to talk with him at the end of the week.         
	Federer was missing due to a back injury when Switzerland lost 1-4 to the US in the first round of the World Group in March in Birmingham, Alabama.         
	The Swiss face Italy in a playoff at Genoa on September 18-20 to stay in the elite 16-team group with a chance to win the 2010 title.         
	Federer will be 29 when next years final is played, with few chances left to fulfil his ambition of winning a first Davis Cup title for Switzerland.         
	Luethi, who is also part of Federers coaching team, said the top-ranked player told him in May and again at Wimbledon that he intended to play in Italy.         
	Even if we havent been given an easy opponent, Federer was happy he didnt have to play at the other end of the world, Luethi said.         
	Federer is currently taking a break from playing after his wife Mirka gave birth to twin girls, Charlene Riva and Myla Rose, last Thursday. He is scheduled to return at a tournament starting August 10 in Montreal.         
	If the twins are in good health I dont see any problem, Luethi said of Federer playing against Italy.         
	The best-of-five series against Italy is to be played on outdoor clay courts, beginning five days after the mens singles final of the US Open on hard courts where Federer is the five-time defending champion.         
	Federer would likely team up with the 24th-ranked Stanislas Wawrinka to play singles and doubles against the Italians.         
	The pair won Olympic gold in the mens doubles at Beijing last August, then a few weeks later swept all the matches as Switzerland beat Belgium in a World Group playoff. (AP)

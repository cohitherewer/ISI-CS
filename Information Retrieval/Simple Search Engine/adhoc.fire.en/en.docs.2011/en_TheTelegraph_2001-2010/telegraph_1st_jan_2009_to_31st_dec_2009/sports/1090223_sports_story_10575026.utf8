	Christchurch: The Indian team was about to wind up a four-hour training-cum-net session at the Lincoln University campus when a tall, confident figure sauntered into the practice area.         
	Former India coach John Wright barely made his presence aware, he was greeted with warmth and affection by the team management and the cricketers.         
	Their reverence for the man, who had begun the process of building a potent, match-winning Indian unit, was evident.         
	Yet, Wright wasnt willing to take the credit for Indian crickets profitable turn around and praised current coach Gary Kirsten.         
	There is a lot of potential in this side. I am happy they are doing very well. You have good men in Kirsten and Paddy (Upton). And they are playing under a good captain as well, said Wright.         
	Wright is keen to return to India in the capacity of a coach. I would love to be associated with Indian cricket. I miss the place, curry and traffic. It is an exotic place, unlike the cold weather here, said Wright.

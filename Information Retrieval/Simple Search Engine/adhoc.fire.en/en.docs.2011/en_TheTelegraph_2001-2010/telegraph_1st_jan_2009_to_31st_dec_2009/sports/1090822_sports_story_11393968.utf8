                                                   Freddie to be out for long
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	London: Andrew Flintoff will undergo major reconstructive surgery on his knee immediately after the Oval Test, which could force him out of cricket until next summer.         
	This newspaper has come to understand that Flintoff has been booked in for surgery on Tuesday to cure a chronic knee problem that has already curtailed his Test career.         
	Surgeon Andy Williams will carry out the procedure in London. If his recuperation goes according to plan, Flintoff will be out for around six to nine months.

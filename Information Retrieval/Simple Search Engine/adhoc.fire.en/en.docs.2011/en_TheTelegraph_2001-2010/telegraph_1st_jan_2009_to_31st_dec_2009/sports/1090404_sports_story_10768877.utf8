The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | John plan has merit: Ricky
                                                   John plan has merit: Ricky
                      
	Durban: John Buchanans multiple-captain doctrine may have ruffled a few feathers but Australia captain Ricky Ponting feels the suggestion has some merit.         
	Ponting said Buchanans move to have multiple captains at the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) would take some pressure off Sourav Ganguly and the move might actually work.         
	I heard the other day he was actually talking about having a couple of captains on the ground at once. I dont know how thats going to work, Ponting said.         
	But I know Tassie (Tasmania) actually experimented with that a few years ago. They had Dan Marsh and George Bailey. One was doing the field placings and one was doing the bowling changes.         
	So it just sort of lightened the load up I guess on the actual captain on the field and gave him a bit more opportunity to think about different things. I dont see theres a lot of problems with it, said Ponting who has decided to skip this second edition of the Indian Premier League, starting April 18, in South Africa.         
	Ponting made it clear that he would not tolerate any IPL talk in the dressing room during the series.         
	We are the No. 2-ranked one-day team in the world and wed love to see ourselves back in the No.1 ranking by the end of this series. They will be the motivating factors for us, nothing to do with the IPL, Ponting told reporters.

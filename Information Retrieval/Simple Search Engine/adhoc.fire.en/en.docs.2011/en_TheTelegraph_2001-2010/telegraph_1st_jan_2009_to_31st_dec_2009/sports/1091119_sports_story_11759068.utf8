The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | De Ridder puts up a brave face
                                                                                                                                   De Ridder puts up a brave face
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal coach Phillippe de Ridder tried to put up a brave face after his teams 2-2 draw against Railway FC Wednesday, but his helplessness with a limping side was quite evident.         
	Though De Ridder was satisfied with the fact that his team tried their level best, he admitted he was finding it difficult to get suitable players for different positions.         
	I dont have players for every position That was the reason why I had to switch to different formations during the game. When you dont have too many options, youll have to try out new things. Also, I didnt get much time with the players. Hence, it was important that I try things and then, if that didnt work, I change to something else quickly, said De Ridder.         
	However, he defended his experiments with different players in different positions saying that, in soccer, players need to adapt quickly and have a basic idea about playing in all positions. As a football player, you are expected to adapt to different positions. That is necessary, he said.         
	But he reminded that he was happy with the chances his boys created. They gave their 100 per cent. Yes we missed two points, but the positive is that we were able to create some good moves and had quite a few chances, the Belgian said.         
	He also said that with the fixtures of the CFL yet to be decided, it was at times difficult for him to form a team. Not that it is a big problem. But at times it will be difficult to form a team if you dont know about your next match. CFL will be a really tough, he concluded.

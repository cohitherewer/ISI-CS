The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal leave today on   Ranji quest
                                                   Bengal leave today on   Ranji quest
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Bengal players on Friday had their last practice session at the Eden before their departure for Pune.         
	The squad leaves Saturday morning for their opening Ranji Trophy match against Maharashtra from Tuesday.         
	The stress was on match situations during Fridays practice. Newly appointed assistant coach Gautam Shome (Jr) was also present.         
	Coach Roger Binny left for home after practice because of his mothers illness and will join the team in Pune.         
	Rohan Gavaskar also reported at the Eden directly from the airport after arriving from Mumbai.         
	CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya met the players in the evening.         
	This is not about any pep talk. The players are aware about their responsibilities I only wished them luck, Dalmiya said later.         
	Strangely, every player was handed over a sheet containing contact numbers of their teammates to improve communication, as a CAB official put it, among themselves.         
	As if the players were not aware of it!

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | RP looks strong for comeback
                                                     RP looks strong for comeback
    - World T20 squad set to be picked today           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            R.P. Singh                                 
	Dubai: Left-arm quick Rudra Pratap Singh, who has been in excellent form for the Deccan Chargers in the ongoing IPL in South Africa, is very likely to make the Team India XV for next months ICC World T20, in England.         
	The selectors will (as of now) pick the squad, via a tele-conference, on Monday. Of the quintet, four are in India, while Yashpal Sharma is one of the IPLs Match Referees.         
	Chief selector Krishnamachari Srikkanth, who is associated with the Chennai Super Kings, returned on Saturday. Three of his colleagues  Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave and Raja Venkat  whod been sent to South Africa by the Board, to have a closer look at the players, are also back home.         
	RP has been bowling really well and he could make a comeback, at the expense of Munaf Patel, a well-placed source told The Telegraph on Sunday.         
	The last time the selectors picked a T20 squad was for the tour of New Zealand, earlier this year. Sixteen made that trip.         
	If only one wicket-keeper (captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni) goes, then RP for Munaf may be the lone change with Dinesh Karthik omitted. If a second keeper is a must, then Ravindra Jadeja could be dropped, to ensure that Karthik stays, the well-placed source added.         
	RPs last appearance in the Team India colours had been during the ODIs against England, last November. Incidentally, hed been absolutely outstanding in the inaugural World T20, in 2007.         
	In fact, RP had taken 12 wickets, one less than the editions most successful, Pakistans Umar Gul.         
	Unless somebody makes himself unavailable, the XIII certainties are: Dhoni; Virender Sehwag (vice-captain), Yuvraj Singh, Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma; Irfan Pathan, Yusuf Pathan; Harbhajan Singh, Pragyan Ojha; Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma, Praveen Kumar.         
	RP is, well, almost there. The one remaining berth may go to Karthik or Jadeja. Rookie Abhishek Nayar, it seems, is the dark horse. Apparently, experienced Robin Uthappa too.

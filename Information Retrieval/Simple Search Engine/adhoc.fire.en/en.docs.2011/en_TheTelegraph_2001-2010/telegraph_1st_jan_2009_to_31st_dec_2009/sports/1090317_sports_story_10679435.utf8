                                                   Aussies thump Pak to keep hopes alive
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Australia kept their title hopes alive with a thumping 107-run win over Pakistan in their second Super Six stage match of the ICC Womens World Cup at Sydney on Monday.         
	The defending champions, who were stunned by India in their opening Super Six game, posted 229 for 6 on the board before bundling out Pakistan for 122 in the 46th over.         
	The win took the Aussies to the second position with India and New Zealand on the World Cup points table. England lead the standings. We had a few people contributing with the bat all throughout the order which was a good change from the others games weve had. We were more disciplined with the ball and hit the right areas which made it easier to set the right fields, stand-in captain Alex Blackwell said after the win.         
	Shelley Nitschke (56), Leah Poulton (47) and Lauren Ebsary (51) were the chief contributors with the bat for Australia.         
	Player of the match Nitschke and Poultons 100-run opening stand set up the total. The partnership ended with Nitschke bowled by Sana Mir for 56. Poulton fell in a similar manner four overs later before Blackwell was run out for three as Australia lost 3 for 30 in 45 balls to lose some of its momentum.         
	While Mirs double breakthrough was a boost for Pakistan, she then missed two vital caught and bowled opportunities from Ebsary soon after. Pakistan began its chase aggressively and hit 16 from the opening two overs before Rene Farrell bowled Nain Abidi in the third over with the score on 19.         
	Asmavia continued Pakistans solid start but her dismissal for 32 came in the middle of a Pakistan batting collapse in which they lost six wickets for just 24.         
	BRIEF SCORES

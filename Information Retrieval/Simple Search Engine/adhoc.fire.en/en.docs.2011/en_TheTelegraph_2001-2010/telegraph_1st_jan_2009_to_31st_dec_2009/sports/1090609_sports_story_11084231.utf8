	 T20 chance cricket, says Imran
    Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan feels T20 cricket is still in its infancy and no team appears to have a clear approach to it. At present, the way I see it, all the teams are just going with the flow and T20 cricket is only about luck and taking chances. There is no science or planning in how the teams play this format, Khan told reporters during a visit to Karachi.         
	He said that just like ODI cricket, T20 would also evolve with time and teams will start understanding the format better and play accordingly. I am sure this will happen with T20 cricket as well but right now it is just Tullebaazi (chance cricket), he added.               
	 Symonds offers
    Melbourne: Andrew Symondss plate is full with offers from across the world. His current Indian Premier League franchise, Deccan Chargers have already shown their support towards Symonds after he was sent back from the Twenty20 World Cup in England following an alcohol-related incident. Notwithstanding his $1.35 million IPL contract, Symonds is also being sought by English and South African leagues. Symondss manager Matt Fearon said the explosive batsman, who turns 34 on Tuesday, was keen to play on despite Cricket Australia indicating they will withdraw his 2009-10 contract.               
	 Franklin view
    London: New Zealand all-rounder James Franklin feels that T20 cricket will only become bigger but the Test format will remain the true measure of greatness for a player. The lanky all-rounder dismissed suggestions that the slam-bang format of the game will rule cricket in future, surpassing Test matches.         
	There is going to be more of T20 because I think the crowd really enjoys it and the players enjoy it too. (But) Test cricket is the real heart of the game. Its where you can really measure yourself against the greats.               
	 Shastri doubt
    Nottingham: Former India skipper Ravi Shastri feels it would be nothing short of a miracle if India retain the ICC World Twenty20 title given the fickle nature of crickets shortest format. It would be miraculous if India indeed go on to defend their crown, Shastri said when asked about Indias chances.

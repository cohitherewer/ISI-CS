                                                     Pak rookies ruffle Lankan feathers
                  Mohammed Amir on Saturday.                     
	Galle: Teenager Mohammed Amir led Pakistans spirited new-look attack to bowl out Sri Lanka for 292 on the opening day of the first Test Saturday.         
	In reply, Pakistan were 15 for two at stumps with skipper Younis Khan on seven and nightwatchman Abdur Rauf yet to score after openers Salman Butt and Khurram Manzoor fell within the first four overs.         
	Butt was bowled by Nuwan Kulasekera off the second ball of the innings and Manzoor was trapped leg-before by Thilan Thushara.         
	Amir, a 17-year-old left-arm pacer, grabbed three wickets and fellow debutant Rauf picked up two after Younis sent Lanka in to bat on a wicket freshened up by early morning rain.         
	Younis himself took two for 23. Wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal claimed four catches and a stumping as Lanka slipped to 194 for six.         
	Left-hander Tharanga Paranavitana was Lankas saviour with 72. Tharanga added 75 for the third wicket with Mahela Jayawardene (30) and 43 for the fourth with Thilan Samaraweera (31).

  - I-League
  -   Sunil Chetris superb strike goes in vain         OUR CORRESPONDENT            Edeh Chidi scored a brace                                 
	Mumbai: East Bengals hopes of returning home unscathed from Cooperage were dashed after they went down 1-2 to Mahindra United in an 18th round I-League match, here on Friday.         
	Missing the services of key players like Yusif Yakubu and Ismail Addo, Subhas Bhowmicks team entered the pitch with modest ambitions of taking home atleast a point, but two penalties threw the spanner in their works.         
	Nigerian Edeh Chidi scored both the goals from the spot (54th and 71st), nullifying a brilliant strike by Sunil Chetri that put the Calcutta club ahead five minutes into the second half.         
	Bhowmick would later lament the chance factor going against his side but Mahindra deserved to win, purely for the way custodian Subhashish Chowdhury came up with three stunning saves in the last 10 minutes.         
	First, Chowdhury denied substitute Parveen Kumar in an one-on-one situation before blocking a strike from Surkumar Singh. Then, in the stoppage time, Chowdhury threw himself against a full-blooded shot from close range by Parveen.         
	East Bengal might have had a point in protesting against the first penalty. Referee A Arjunan pointed to the dreaded spot when Sushant Mathew seemed to have stumbled at the slightest obstruction from Mehrajuddin Wadoo. Chidi made no mistake in converting the penalty.         
	That goal came as a blow to Bhowmicks men who rode Chetris class to go 1-0 up.         
	The 23-year-old striker proved height doesnt always matter as he got the better of three Mahindra players in meeting a poor clearance by D Ravanan and fired a right-footed volley despite losing his body balance. A strike even Mahindra hero Chowdhury could do nothing about.         
	East Bengal conceded the second penalty when Nirmal Chetri committed a foul on Chidi and the latter gave no chance to Abhra Mondal.

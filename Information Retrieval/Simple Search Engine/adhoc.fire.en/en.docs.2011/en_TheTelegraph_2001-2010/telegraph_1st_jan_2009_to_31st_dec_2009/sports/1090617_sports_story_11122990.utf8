                                                   Nehra, Rahane in contention
    - Sachin tendulkar opts out of ODI series in West indies           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Nottingham: Mahendra Singh Dhoni will be without the services of senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkar and two seniors, Virender Sehwag and Zaheer Khan, on the forthcoming tour of the West Indies.         
	Four ODIs are to be played there between June 26-July 5.         
	While Sachin has opted out for personal reasons, Sehwag is unfit and the selectors want to rest Zaheer, who (like Sehwag) suffered a shoulder injury during the recent IPL.         
	Two of the selectors, chairman Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Raja Venkat, are already in England and they will have a teleconference with colleagues back home on Wednesday.         
	Thats scheduled for 1 pm (IST).         
	According to The Telegraphs source, Ashish Nehra is a strong contender to take Zaheers place. Munaf Patel and Dhawal Kulkarni too are in the running.         
	Nehra last played for India almost four years ago, during a triangular series in Zimbabwe. Hes injury prone, but was outstanding in the IPL, finishing No.3 (19 wickets) on the merit list.         
	Sehwags place could go to either Dinesh Karthik, his replacement in the World T20 squad, or Ajinkya Rahane, who was prolific in the 2008-09 domestic season.         
	Murali Vijays name is being whispered as well.         
	One understands the selectors are looking at the possibility of dropping Irfan Pathan. If Karthik doesnt come in for Sehwag, then he may make the cut at Irfans expense.         
	From the World T20 squad, those certain to go are: Dhoni (capt.), Yuvraj Singh (vice-capt.), Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Yusuf Pathan, Ravindra Jadeja, Harbhajan Singh, Pragyan Ojha, Rudra Pratap Singh, Ishant Sharma and Praveen Kumar.         
	Till Tuesday evening, incidentally, it wasnt clear whether the Dhonis would leave for the West Indies from London (on June 22) or go home for a few days.

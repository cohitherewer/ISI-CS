The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Challengers hope to maintain momentum
                                                   Challengers hope to maintain momentum
                      
	Bangalore: Local favourites Royal Challengers Bangalore will be hoping to maintain the winning momentum while the Victoria Bushrangers would be keen to put the defeat to Wayamba Elevens behind themselves when they lock horns in the first League B match of the Champions League T20 Thursday.         
	Both took the same stop-start route to the Super Eight, tasting victory and defeat before eventually making the cut.         
	However, with little margin for error in the league segment both teams would be hoping to get off to a winning start Thursday.         
	For Kumble and his men, playing in front of home crowds can work both ways. While ensuring there wouldnt be a dearth of support it brings additional pressure to bear on the IPL runners-up.         
	The Challengers top-order looks formidable enough with Kallis, Robin Uthappa, Virat Kohli and Ross Taylor in good nick and the Victoria bowlers have their task cut out.         
	Moreover, even if the top-order flounders, the Challengers can rely on Rahul Dravid to bail them out, something the former India captain has done time and again in his illustrious career.         
	Although their bowling looks a little low on glamour Victoria would do well not to underestimate an attack that includes Praveen Kumar, Kallis, Kumble and Roelof van der Merwe.

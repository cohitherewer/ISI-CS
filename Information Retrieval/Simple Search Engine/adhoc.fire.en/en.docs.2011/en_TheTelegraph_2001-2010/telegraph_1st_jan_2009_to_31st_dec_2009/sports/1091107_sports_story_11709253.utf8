The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arsenal look to carry form
                                                                                                                                   Arsenal look to carry form
                      
	London: Fast-improving Arsenal can creep above Manchester United on Saturday if they win at Wolverhampton Wanderers.         
	The Gunners go into the match seeking to stretch a two-month unbeaten streak in which they have outscored their league opponents 19-5 and also looking to build momentum ahead of a crucial match against Chelsea on Nov. 29.         
	Cesc Fabregas has been in fine form for Arsenal and, with Samir Nasri scoring in the Champions League thrashing of AZ Alkmaar, manager Arsene Wenger can be confident of a good showing from his boys.         
	But the focus of this weekends matches is the one between the defending champions and, at this moment, their biggest challengers.         
	United sit just two points behind Chelsea on the table but, as they prepare to visit Stamford Bridge on Sunday, there is a sense that something is not quite right with the Premier League champions.         
	Last months 0-2 defeat at Liverpool was, for Alex Ferguson, a sobering experience and concrete proof that the loss of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid and Carlos Tevez to Manchester City has severely diminished his team as an attacking force.         
	Uniteds worries would have been compounded by news that Rio Ferdinand will miss the visit to Chelsea.         
	United manager Alex Ferguson, who marked his 23rd anniversary in charge of the club on Friday, said that experts have been unable to pinpoint the nature of a calf injury which has sidelined the defender for the last two weeks.         
	While defeat at Stamford Bridge would not be catastrophic, Ferguson knows that a repeat of the Anfield debacle at Chelsea could put Carlo Ancelottis team in the driving seat in the title race as winter looms.         
	United will no doubt miss Ferdinand while Gary Neville is suspended but Vidic and Ryan Giggsare likely to return.           (AGENCIES)

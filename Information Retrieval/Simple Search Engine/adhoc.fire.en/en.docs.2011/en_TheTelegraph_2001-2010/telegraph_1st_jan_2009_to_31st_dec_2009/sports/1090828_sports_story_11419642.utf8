	Bangalore: Coach Gary Kirsten Thursday said the Indian team were determined to play with renewed unity and spirit to keep the momentum going after their consistent performance in one-dayers over last eight months.         
	The one-day team has got a virtually 80:20 win-loss ratio in the last eight months. We take pride in our consistency and our performances over a period of time. So, we like to continue that, Kirsten said.         
	One of the things we have taken pride in is the fact that we are playing as a team for a big cause  thats for making Team India No.1. Weve enjoyed success since the tour of Australia last year. We take a lot of pride in being able to do that, he added.         
	The former South African opener sought to downplay the debacle in the Twenty20 World Cup, saying: Setback at the Twenty20 World Cup could happen to any world-class team.         
	We are looking ahead and looking forward (to) what we can achieve, Kirsten said on the sidelines of the first day of the four-day camp for India ahead of the tri-series in Sri Lanka and Champions Trophy in South Africa.

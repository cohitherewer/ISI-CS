                                                   ICL is low quality cricket: Razzaq
                      
	Karachi: Back in the national side after snapping ties with the Indian Cricket League (ICL), Pakistan allrounder Abdul Razzaq said he had a torrid time adjusting to mainstream cricket after playing in the low standard rebel League.         
	It wasnt easy getting back into international cricket after a long absence. This is the highest standards of cricket being played in the world and playing in the ICL and its low standards of cricket, it needs a great deal of mental adjustment, Razzaq said in London.         
	Razzaq made a successful comeback to the Pakistan side taking two wickets after he rushed to England as a replacement for injured pacer Yasir Arafat.         
	However, the allrounder is not satisfied with his performance and said he had set high standards for himself and blamed the ICL for making things difficult.         
	Razzaq said he had breathed a sigh of relief after quitting the ICL last month.         
	Razzaq, Mohammed Yousuf, Rana Naved and Imran Nazir have all quit the ICL and the PCB has already got clearance from the ICC to draft back the first three into the national team.         
	Yousuf and Naved are expected to join Razzaq in the national team for the coming tour of Sri Lanka from June 27. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IWF may ban India again
                                                                                                                       7                                      IWF may ban India again
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) on Saturday indicated that India could once again be banned for a series of doping offences by their lifters.         
	The executive board of the IWF, which met in the Goyang City in South Korea, said it had taken very serious view of the situation in India, but would take any action only after the doping cases are closed.         
	The statement said: The IWF executive board discussed the issue of several Indian positive doping cases, and the fact that India has repeatedly produced multiple cases in recent years.         
	However, since the cases are still in process, the executive board shall take a very strong action against the Indian federation, once all the cases are closed.         
	The international body has, in the past, banned India thrice. On a separate occasion, a fine of $50,000 was slapped.         
	Last week, the entire executive committee of the IWF, including the president and the secretary, resigned from their respective positions taking moral responsibility for the doping menace that has hit the sport in India.         
	The IOA is likely to call for fresh elections of the weightlifting body next month.

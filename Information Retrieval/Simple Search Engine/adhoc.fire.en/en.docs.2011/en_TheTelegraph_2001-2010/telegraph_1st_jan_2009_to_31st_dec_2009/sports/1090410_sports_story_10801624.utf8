	Cape Town: AB de Villiers and Jacques Kallis scored half-centuries and Albie Morkel and Mark Boucher hit out late in the innings Thursday to guide South Africa to 289 for six wickets in the third one-day International against Australia.               
	At midnight, Australia were 88 for four in 25 overs, chasing 290. David Hussey (12) and Callum Ferguson (1) were at the crease.               
	De Villiers scored 80 off 87 balls and added 114 with Kallis, who scored 70 off 86 balls. De Villiers hit seven fours to Kallis five.         
	Australia will have to break the record for a team batting second at Newlands to win and take a 2-1 lead in the five-match series after the Proteas recorded the fourth highest total at the ground.         
	Morkel, whose 29 came off 25 balls, and Boucher, who collected 28 not out off 15 deliveries, piled up a combined 56 runs in the final five overs of the innings.         
	The sixth-wicket partnership between the pair was worth 53 runs in five overs.         
	Openers Herschelle Gibbs and Graeme Smith went relatively cheaply, with Smith caught behind for eight to give left-arm quick Mitchell Johnson the first of his four wickets with 28 runs on the board in the seventh over.         
	Johnson, who used changes of pace to great effect, was difficult to get away on the sluggish pitch.         
	Gibbs hit 26 off 46 before going for a slog-sweep off Nathan Bracken to be caught at deep mid-wicket by James Hopes 22 runs and eight overs later. After De Villiers and Kallis had fought back well to lift the run rate from 3.5 an over in the 15th, they went within five overs of each other to leave South Africa on 198 for four in the 41st over.         
	Kallis chipped a ball to Hopes at mid-wicket off Brett Geeves, while De Villiers, walking around to unsettle Johnson, got a leading edge to mid-off to be caught by Nathan Hauritz.         
	Johnson also dismissed JP Duminy for 29, caught off a flat-batted shot in the covers by Michael Hussey, and Morkel, bowled in the final over of the innings.         
	Johnson finished with four for 34, with the rest of the attack unable to stem the scoring. Geeves came in for Ben Laughlin as Australias only change to the team that lost by seven wickets in Pretoria on Sunday.         
	He was expensive, though, going for 67 runs for the wicket of Kallis.                 (AP)

                                                   We hope to defend T20 title: Ishant
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Colombo: Lanky speedster Ishant Sharma was not part of the Indian squad that lifted the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup in 2007 in South Africa but the he has no doubt that the team would do whatever it takes to defend the title in England later this year.         
	We will try our level best to win it again, said Ishant, who felt the format was tilted well in favour of the batsmen.         
	I saw and heard the reception for the winning India team in 2007 and want to be part of that this year. It was a big day for Indian cricket to win a world event after a long time and I want to be a part of that in 2009, Ishant said on the sidelines of the unveiling of the ICC World Twenty20 trophy on Monday.         
	Ishant said bowling in the shortest form of the game was a test but discipline was the key to success.         
	Its like bowling in a batting powerplay all the time, he said. Its not easy for bowlers but its all about sticking to plans, the speedster said.         
	Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene felt Twenty20 posed fresh challenge for both the batsmen and bowlers.         
	Batsmen have to be innovative and bowlers need to look for different options. Its a bold new concept. It offered international cricketers new challenges, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 2 Indians in AIS squad
                                                     2 Indians in AIS squad
            A STAFF REPORTER    
	Calcutta: Two MRF Pace Foundation players, Rahul Shukla and Nizar Niyas, feature in a 17-man Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) squad that has been named for the Emerging Players Tournament (EPT) in Queensland starting on 20 July, Cricket Australia said in a release Wednesday.         
	Greg Chappell, the AIS team coach said that he was pleased the institutes growing relationship with the Indian academy. In addition to our 2009 AIS scholars we will be joined by two players from the MRF Pace Foundation who will play with the AIS which will provide an excellent opportunity for them to play in this competition that is evolving year on year, the former India coach said.         
	I believe it is a really talented group that will benefit greatly from playing in this series against quality competition. Tournaments such as the EPT are an important part of the ongoing development of our most talented players.         
	The AIS team will be looking to win the title for the first time against teams from India, New Zealand and South Africa in Twenty20 and 50-over matches. Karnataka won the inaugural EPT in 2005, while South Africa won in 2006 and 2007 and New Zealand won last year.

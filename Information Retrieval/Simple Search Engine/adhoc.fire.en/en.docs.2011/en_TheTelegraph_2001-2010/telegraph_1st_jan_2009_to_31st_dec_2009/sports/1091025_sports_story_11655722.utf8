The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pune FC yet to taste win
                                                   Pune FC yet to taste win
                      
	Pune: Hosts Pune FC (PFC) and Mumbai FC (MFC) played a 1-1 draw in an I-League match, here on Saturday. Pune FC skipper S Venkatesh put the home team ahead in the 10th minute but Darren Caldiera restored parity in the 23rd minute. The Derreck Perreira-coached team is yet to taste victory after four matches.         
	In Margao, Sporting Clube de Goa take on Salgaocar Sports Club on Sunday. We have not got the start that we were looking for. Against Lajong, we completely dominated the match but could not score. But our rival made use of the only opportunity they got and scored, which saw us ending on losing side, said club president Peter Vaz.         
	Even against Pune FC, we were sitting pretty after scoring two goals and were set to collect full points, but lack of concentration in the defence allowed our opponent to come back and draw the match. But we are looking to collect full points, Vaz added. (PTI)

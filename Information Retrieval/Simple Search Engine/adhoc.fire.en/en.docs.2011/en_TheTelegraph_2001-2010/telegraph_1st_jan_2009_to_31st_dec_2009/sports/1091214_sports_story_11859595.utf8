The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tuffey puts NZ in box seat
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tuffey puts NZ in box seat
                      
	Napier: The third Test between Pakistan and New Zealand turned into a fascinating contest Sunday, the third day of the match, as the visitors openers scored 128 in 56 overs in their second innings.         
	That cut the hosts lead to 120 with two days to go. They finished their first innings at 471 earlier Sunday, gaining an unexpected 248-run lead.         
	Pacer Daryl Tuffey, whose previous highest score was 35, nearly reached his maiden Test hundred as the Black Caps gained control of the match. However, their vice-like grip on the contest had loosened at stumps with Salman Butt and Imran Farhat reaching half-centuries, according to Cricinfo.         
	The second and third sessions were fascinating to watch. New Zealands plan A appeared to be heavily influenced by Pakistans terrible first-innings effort. They bowled outside the off stump to both the left-handed openers, hoping they would reach out for the ball. To Butt, who tends to fall over on his front foot, the New Zealanders occasionally brought the ball back in to force an lbw, and for Farhat, they had a short mid-off in place for the uppish drive.         
	Plan A did not work, though, for the openers were determined not to chase anything they did not have to, and also because there was not much help from the pitch. So New Zealand started bowling with more imagination in the second session. The seamers attacked the stumps more, slipped the odd delivery outside off and Daniel Vettori, as usual, was on target. However, Butt and Farhat continued to be patient.

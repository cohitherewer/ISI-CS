The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rooney hattrick sinks Pompey

	London: Wayne Rooney scored a hattrick as Manchester United beat bottom-place Portsmouth 4-1 Saturday to stay in touch with Chelsea in the Premier League title race.         
	By winning the second straight match for the first time in two months, defending champions United went two points behind leader Chelsea, who play at Arsenal on Sunday.         
	Manchester City slumped to a seventh successive draw after Hull held the big-spending club 1-1, while West Ham defeated Burnley 5-3 and Bolton remained in the relegation zone after drawing 1-1 at Fulham.         
	In Saturdays other matches, Blackburn were held to a 0-0 draw by Stoke while Wigan beat Sunderland 1-0.         
	Avram Grant took charge of Portsmouth for the first time after being appointed manager following Paul Harts dismissal.         
	But Grant  whose first and last matches as Chelsea manager were losses to United  once again had the misfortune to face the 18-time English champions after 18 months away from management.         
	Ben Fosters status as Manchester Uniteds third-choice goalkeeper was also underlined as Tomas Kuszczak was selected in place of the injured Edwin van der Sar. The Pole was quickly called into action as Portsmouth began brightly, denying Aruna Dindane before an excellent acrobatic save to deny Jamie Hara         
	Grants team received the first shock when Rooney tumbled in the penalty area following a clumsy challenge by Michael Brown. But after Rooney converted from the penalty kick in the 25th minute, Kevin-Prince Boateng levelled from the spot at the other end after Nemanja Vidic fouled Frederic Piquionne.         
	Rooney restored Uniteds lead three minutes into the second half when he latched onto Ryan Giggss pass.         
	The England forward grabbed a third minutes later when Piquionne was penalised for fouling Giggs and he slotted in the penalty kick. And Giggs found time to score his 100th Premier League goal on the eve of his 36th birthday to leave Pompey rooted to the bottom of the standings.         
	At Manchester City, not even the return of Brazil forward Robinho after three months on the sidelines could return Mark Hughess side to winning ways.         
	Shaun Wright-Phillips had put big-spending City ahead on the stroke of half time with a 25-metre (yard) strike, but Jimmy Bullard levelled in the closing minutes from the penalty spot after Joleon Lescott was adjudged to have handled.         
	Of course it is a disappointing run were on, because were failing to see out victories when we have the lead, Hughes said.         
	Were trying to get something started here but at times we look exactly what we are, a side that has been thrown together very quickly.         
	After being humiliated 1-9 by Spurs last weekend, Wigan rebounded at home to Sunderland courtesy Hugo Rodallegas sixth goal of the season.         
	Sunderland striker Darren Bent, who is black, later said his mother was on the receiving end of racist comments. So we get beaten by Wigan and to make matters worse, my mum gets racially abused by a Sunderland fan, Bent wrote on Twitter. I wont stand for that.         
	At Upton Park, West Ham boosted their relegation battle by winning for only the third time this season.         
	Jack Collison, Junior Stanislas and Carlton Cole gave West Ham a three-goal lead before halftime against Burnley. Guillermo Franco headed in after the break and Luis Jiminez scored the first goal of his loan spell from Inter Milan to make it 5-0 before the hour mark.         
	Despite Steven Fletcher scoring twice and Chris Eagles also hitting the target to reduce the deficit, Burnley have collected just one point now from seven away matches since returning to the top flight. Steven Caldwell was sent off for the visitors.         
	At Craven Cottage, Ivan Klasnic sent Bolton into the break with the lead and despite Damien Duff equalising for Fulham, the draw ended the visitors run of three straight defeats.         
	Meanwhile, Blackburn manager Sam Allardyce has been discharged from hospital following heart surgery.         
	The 55-year-old Allardyce underwent an angioplasty, a procedure to correct narrowing to one branch of his coronary arteries, on Friday.         
	Allardyces assistant, Neil McDonald, said he was recovering at home on Saturday as his side drew 0-0 against Stoke at Ewood Park.         
	It was the third match he missed but he could be back in charge on Wednesday, when Blackburn are at home to Chelsea in the quarter finals of the League Cup. (AP)

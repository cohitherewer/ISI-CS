The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Seedings, groups to be redone
                                                   Seedings, groups to be redone
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: The seedings and groups specific to the much-delayed sixth edition of the Champions Trophy, in South Africa from September 24-October 5, will be drawn afresh.         
	This was confirmed by Brian Murgatroyd, media and communications manager of the International Cricket Council (ICC), on Thursday.         
	A fortnight ago, the ICCs general manager (cricket), Dave Richardson, had said no decision had been taken.         
	The seedings and groups are going to be redone, based again on the ICCs ODI rankings We definitely wont be following the earlier (March 12, 2008) cut-off That wont make sense, Murgatroyd told The Telegraph.         
	Its understood that the next meeting of the ICCs Executive Board, in Dubai on April 16-17, will decide on the new cut-off.         
	The edition was to have been hosted by Pakistan, between September 11-28 last year, but got postponed and then relocated following apprehensions over the security environment there.         
	Going by the rankings of March 12, 2008, the seedings and groups were:         
	Group A: Australia (1), India (4), Pakistan (5), West Indies (8).         
	Group B: South Africa (2), New Zealand (3), Sri Lanka (6), England (7).         
	If the template is unchanged with, say, April 1 of the current year as the fresh cut-off, then the seedings and groups are going to be very different.         
	World champions Australia and India would find themselves in group B, with South Africa and New Zealand in group A.         
	The other four teams wont get affected but for a change in seedings in group B  England at No.6, followed by Sri Lanka (No.7), instead of the other way around.         
	Indeed, except for Pakistan and the West Indies, the ODI rankings of the other teams in the top-eight have changed in the past 13 months.

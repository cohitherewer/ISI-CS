                                                     Chetan can make it to the top-5, says Gopi
            A STAFF REPORTER            Pullela Gopichand with one of the trainees in Calcutta on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Chief badminton national coach Pullela Gopichand believes that Saina Nehwal would be able to win all the major world titles if she can manage to keep away injuries.         
	Saina (Nehwal) has the potential to play at least for another 10 years And if she manages to stay injury free, I believe by the end of her career she will have the Olympic gold, the All England Open Championships and other major titles, Gopichand said.         
	According to him, Chetan Anand, among men shuttlers, has it in him to make it to the top-five in the world.         
	Chetan is a very talented player. He has it in him to make it to the top-five in the world. And the way he is playing, I believe he is capable, he stated.         
	I think anything below this will be an under-achievement for him (Chetan), he added.         
	Hailing Anup Sridhar as another promising player in the country, the 35-year old Dronacharya said: Anup can be dangerous on his day. He is good and is very much promising. But he needs to come out of the mental block to progress to the top.         
	Talking about Indias performance in the recently concluded World Badminton Championships, the former All England champion appeared quite happy. He rued missing medals though Saina Nehwal (in womens singles) and Jwala Gutta (mixed doubles) made it to the quarter finals, Gopichand said: I am happy with our performance there. But we should have won at least a medal.         
	We never reached two quarter finals ever before So chances were really high this time, Gopi said.

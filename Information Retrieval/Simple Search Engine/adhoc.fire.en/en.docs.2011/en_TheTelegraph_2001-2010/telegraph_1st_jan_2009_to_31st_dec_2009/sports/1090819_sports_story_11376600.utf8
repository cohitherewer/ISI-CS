	New Delhi: The national football team will be in line for a rare hattrick of triumphs in international tournaments when the five-nation ONGC-Nehru Cup 2009 kick starts at the Ambedkar Stadium on Wednesday.         
	In the opener to be played under lights at Indias favourite ground, the hosts will take on Lebanon, a team that had beaten India twice comprehensively in the World Cup qualifiers two years ago.         
	A lot of water, however, has flown through the river since then. Described as the sleeping giants of Asian football by the then AFC general secretary, Peter Velappan, India had produced some encouraging results under Bob Houghton in the past two years.         
	The Indian turnaround started with a surprise title triumph in the Nehru Cup 2007 at the Ambedkar Stadium, followed by their victory in the AFC Challenge at the same venue that propelled them to the final rounds of the Asian Cup for the first time in 24 years.         
	With Houghton showing Indian football a ray of light, no wonder the football fans here are hoping for an encore from the national team in the Nehru Cup.         
	Though the fact remains that India are still languishing at the 156th place in the Fifa rankings, the popular belief is that the boys are still capable of defending the title in the round robin cum knockout tournament.         
	To add to the hopes, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has done well to pick teams that would help to make the Nehru Cup a balanced meet.         
	Going by the rankings, all other teams barring Syria are placed between 148 and 160 and are capable of donning the role of the champions on their own day.         
	Syria, who are currently ranked 95, have made vast progress since the time they were beaten by India in the 2007 Nehru Cup. Their coach Fazr Ebrahim said that though he was missing a few key players, his team would be looking to avenge the 2007 defeat.         
	Lebanon would be the other team that may upset Indias applecart at the Ambedkar Stadium. Coached by Emile Rustom, the team has a strong line up including star striker Mohammed Ghaddar, who struck four goals against India in the World Cup qualifiers two years ago.         
	But then, as Bob Houghton insisted, there is no reason to undermine Indias preparations to defend the title. The 11-day training in Dubai followed by the month-long camp in Barcelona, according to the coach, has done the team a world of good.         
	The boys are well prepared to accept the challenge, said Houghton. No coach in the world would predict the result but India would definitely play well in the Nehru Cup beginning tomorrow (Wednesday), he emphasised.         
	India are likely to play with the usual 4-4-2 formation with Bhaichung Bhutia pairing up with Sushil Singh upfront. While Steven Dias, NP Pradeep, Climax Lawrence and Anthony Pereira will play in the middle, Surkumar Singh, Anwar, Gourmangi Singh and NS Manju are expected to man the defence.         
	Skipper Bhutia said that though the team would be missing the services of Chetri in the first match, he was sure Sushil would play a good game. Sushil is one of the most improved players in the team, he said.         
	We have a set team, which is in great condition. There is no reason why we should not be able to retain the title, said the Indian captain. The stage is certainly set for the Indians to repeat their 2007 performance that saw a capacity crowd watching a football match for the first time in many years in the capital.         
	While the sponsors and the federation have so far pumped in all their resources to rekindle the success story, it is now left to Bhutia and his teammates to keep the Indian flag flying high.         
	The Indian squad         
	Goalkeepers: Subroto Paul and Subhasish Roy Chowdhury.

            A STAFF REPORTER            Dav Whatmore and Sourav Ganguly at the Eden on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: With the reins of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) wresting in captain Sourav Ganguly and coach Dav Whatmores hands this time, there are reasons galore for the franchises fans to hope for a turnaround after two unimpressive seasons in the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	While Sourav, as a captain, has etched his name in Indian cricket as the man who turned a bunch of talented but rudderless individuals into a winning combination, Whatmore masterminded a miracle when he coached Sri Lanka to a World Cup triumph.         
	So, it wont be surprising if the duo lead KKR, who were placed at the bottom in the IPLs last edition in South Africa, to glory in the third chapter of the tournament next year.         
	For that to happen, Sourav, at a press conference alongside Whatmore, insisted: Its very important to create a healthy atmosphere in the team, an atmosphere where the players have a free mind.         
	Whatmore emphasised a similar point as he said: Its all about giving the players confidence We have to give them a thorough understanding of their roles in the team. Good co-ordination is important.         
	Sourav added: We need to ensure that we execute plans properly on the field. Matches are not won in the dressing room. How we employ the strategies, will decide our performance.         
	Sourav expressed concern over Ricky Pontings unavailability. We will be missing him for quite a few matches since he will be busy doing national duty, he said.         
	However, theres one apprehension which may haunt the Knights  Souravs bitter tryst with the two Australian coaches he has worked so far. Asked whether Sourav would be third time lucky, Whatmore, the Sri Lanka-born Australian quipped: But Im a Sri Lankan!         
	But, on a more serious note, he said: I have worked in the subcontinent for a long time, first with Sri Lanka and then with Bangladesh. Im familiar to the conditions and am comfortable working over here. Im confident that we (KKR) have players who can turn things around with an honest effort. And the relationship between the coach and the captain is that of trust We have to work together.

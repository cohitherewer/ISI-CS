The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Glare again on Pak players
                                                     Glare again on Pak players
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Umar Gul played for the Kolkata Knight Riders in 2008                           
	Calcutta: Besides the desi fans, the biggest losers as the IPL draws near are the Pakistani cricketers.         
	Indeed, had it been known that the T20 tournaments second edition wouldnt be held where it should be  India  then the Pakistan government wouldnt have barred the Younis Khans, Umar Guls and Sohail Tanvirs from competing in it.         
	The decision, taken by Islamabad on February 2, had been driven by the awesome heat generated after 26/11.         
	Much water has flown down the Indus since and, while the IPL chairman, Lalit Modi, has stated that the squads cant be changed now, some of the Pakistani players could still appeal for a review.         
	Thats a possibility After all, with international cricket coming to a standstill in Pakistan, the players have been pummelled from all sides So, some may appeal for a review, a Karachi-based source told The Telegraph.         
	Late on Sunday, another source said that the Pakistan Cricket Board chairman, Ejaz Butt, could request the Board of Control for Cricket in India to be flexible in the changed circumstances.         
	A point to be noted is that the Khans, Guls and Tanvirs would be crowd-pullers both in England (the likely host this year) and in South Africa (second choice).         
	Gul had turned out for the Kolkata Knight Riders in edition No.1.

            A STAFF REPORTER            Gambhir                           
	Calcutta: Gautam Gambhir has become the first Indian batsman in over four years to head the batting rankings, replacing Pakistans Mohammed Yousuf in the latest Reliance Mobile ICC Player Rankings for Test batsmen issued on Wednesday.         
	Incidentally, the one-day International batting chart is also led by an Indian, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	Yousuf, who had returned to the batting table last week in number one position, has dropped four places to the fifth position.         
	Gambhir became the sixth Indian batsman to lead the batting table in this version of the game.         
	The 27-year-old left-handed opener is the first India batsman after former captain Rahul Dravid to top the batting chart.         
	Sachin Tendulkar is the other India batsman in the last 15 years who has topped the batting chart.         
	There is also a change at the top of the Reliance Mobile ICC Player Rankings for Test bowlers for the first time in more than three years with Muttiah Muralidharan handing over the baton to South Africa fast bowler Dale Steyn.

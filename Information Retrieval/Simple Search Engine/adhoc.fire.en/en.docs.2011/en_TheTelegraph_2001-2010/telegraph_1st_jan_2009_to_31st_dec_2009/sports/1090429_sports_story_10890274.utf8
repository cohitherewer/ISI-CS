The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AIFF project likely to be scrapped 
                                                   AIFF project likely to be scrapped 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The proposed football academy, to be set up jointly by Bharti Enterprises and the All-India Football Federation (AIFF), is unlikely to see the light of day.         
	According to AIFF sources, Bharti, which initially planned to invest Rs 100 crore in the state of the art football academy, is all set to scrap the ambitious project.         
	Though no official confirmation was available, sources said that the sponsors are not too happy with the way things are moving and have opted against going ahead with the plan. The sponsors are uncomfortable on various fronts, sources said. First, it was agreed by both parties to set up the academy in Cuncolim in Goa but they could not acquire the land because of some local problems.         
	Sources also revealed that although the AIFF was keen to transfer the project to Haryana, there were serious differences between the sponsors and the federation regarding the kind of technical expertise to be utilised in developing the academy.         
	While the sponsors wanted to involve Manchester United as major technical partners, a section of the federation officials felt the move would be against the basic idea of setting up a broad-based academy, sources said.         
	A meeting between the representatives of Manchester United and the federation could not resolve the issue. An official from the sponsors was also present for the meeting. When asked whether it has discarded its plan to set up the academy, a Bharti spokesperson neither denied nor confirmed the news.         
	In a statement issued Monday, the spokesperson said: Since there was a significant delay in finalising the transfer of land, we were forced to drop the plan of setting up the football academy in Goa. At this point, we do not have any further comment.         
	The AIFF vice-president Subrata Dutta said he was not aware of the latest development. I was told that the academy might start in Haryana immediately after the general elections.         
	However, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has decided to renew its sponsorship of the Nehru Cup. The chairman and managing director of the company, R.C. Sharma has asked the AIFF to submit its plan for the Nehru Cup, to be held in August.

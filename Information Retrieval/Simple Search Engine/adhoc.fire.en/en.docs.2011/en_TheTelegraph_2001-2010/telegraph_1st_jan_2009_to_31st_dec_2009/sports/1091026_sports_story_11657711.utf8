            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT             Huma                           
	Chennai: Huma, wife of former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram, died at Chennais Apollo Hospital on Sunday morning after being in a coma for five days. She was 42.         
	According to hospital sources, Huma succumbed to multi-organ failure after doctors failed to revive her. She had been admitted to the hospital on October 20.         
	Huma was rushed to the hospital from Chennai airport after her condition worsened on the flight to Singapore from Lahore and the air ambulance had to make an emergency landing.         
	[The Pakistan Cricket Board has condoled the death of Huma. We are with Wasim and his family at this hour of need, and pray to God to give them the strength to bear this great and irreparable loss, chairman Ejaz Butt said in a statement.]         
	Akram had blamed Pakistani doctors for failing to diagnose her illness in time.         
	Her body was taken to another city hospital for embalming and the Indian authorities were helping Akram and his family finalise arrangements to send the body to Lahore.

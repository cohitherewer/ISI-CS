The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sanchez takes eighth stage
                                                   Sanchez takes eighth stage
                      
	St Girons (France): Spains Luis Leon Sanchez outsprinted his breakaway companions to win the 176.5-kms eighth stage of the Tour de France between Andorra and St Girons on Saturday.         
	Sanchez, one of the most promising riders in the bunch, surged on the final stretch to beat Frenchman Sandy Casar, fellow Spaniard Mikel Astarloza and Russias Vladimir Efimkin.         
	Despite numerous attacks in the two first category climbs of the day, which put his leaders spot in jeopardy, Italian Rinaldo Nocentini retained the yellow jersey.         
	The 25-year-old Sanchez, winner of Paris-Nice and six other races this season, was a stage winner on the Tour in Aurillac last year. (Reuters)

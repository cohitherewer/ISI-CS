                                                     SA captain in soup over comments
                  Graeme Smith                     
	Johannesburg: South Africa captain Graeme Smith finds himself embroiled in a controversy for his unflattering comments about former board chief Norman Arendse.         
	Smith was harsh in his assessment of the former Cricket South Africa (CSA) chief in his A Captains Diary 2007- 2009 which hit the stands recently.         
	Referring to Charl Langeveldts baffling selection ahead of Andre Nel for the tour of India last year, Smith wrote: The CSA president was becoming more and more involved in every facet of the game. I think, at various times, he wanted to be captain, coach, CEO, president and convenor of selectors, which became very frustrating.         
	Langeveldt rose in stature by withdrawing from the India tour, saying he did not need such colour-based favour.         
	Smith said it was because of team unity that South Africa saw through Arendses tenure with commendable success.         
	It is an enormous credit to the team that we managed to be successful throughout Arendse presidency, because this wasnt the only curve ball he threw in our direction, wrote Smith.         
	Stung by the remarks, Arendse, who stepped down last year after falling out with CSA chief executive Gerald Majola, said Smiths observations were outrageous.         
	Arendses legal counsel Dines Gihwala told a South African newspaper that he would write to the publishers, Jonathan Ball, to remove the defamatory remarks.         
	If it doesnt happen we will sue, Gihwala was quoted as saying by the newspaper.

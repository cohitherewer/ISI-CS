The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Delhi eyeing first victory of season
                                                                                                                       7                                      Delhi eyeing first victory of season
                      
	New Delhi: Delhi, shrugging off the disappointment of a comprehensive defeat against Uttar Pradesh, would eye first win of the season when they take on Saurashtra in a Ranji Trophy Super League group B match here on Tuesday.         
	Delhi, after losing their last match by an innings and 22 runs to Uttar Pradesh, are now languishing at the sixth position in the tally with just four points. Their opponent, Saurashtra, on the other hand are fourth on the table with seven points to their credit.         
	But for the hosts, lack of consistency is the main problem. And with the unavailability of the regular skipper Aakash Chopra, who is getting married, Delhi have to field a depleted squad in their next match. Virat Kohli will lead the side against Saurashtra on Tuesday and he would be the mainstay of the Delhi batting line-up.         
	Kohli, however, must be a worried leader. Specially after watching his middle-order crumbling down against Uttar Pradesh.

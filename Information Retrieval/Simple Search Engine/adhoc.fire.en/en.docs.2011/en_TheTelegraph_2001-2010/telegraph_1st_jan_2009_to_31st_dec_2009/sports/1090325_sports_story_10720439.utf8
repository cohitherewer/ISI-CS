The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shah Rukh: At KKR, we respect Dadas genius
                                                     Shah Rukh: At KKR, we respect Dadas genius
    - TEAM OWNER RUBBISHES TALK OF HIS BEING IN FAVOUR OF CAPTAINS REMOVAL           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Shah Rukh Khan and Sourav Ganguly during the KKR launch in 2008                                 
	Calcutta: Just when it seemed that the Kolkata Knight Riders dressing room probably wasnt big enough to accommodate three powerful men  principal owner Shah Rukh Khan, captain Sourav Dada Ganguly and cricket manager John Buchanan  Shah Rukh rubbished reports suggesting he favoured Sourav being replaced.         
	Wont even comment on such nonsense piece of news, was Shah Rukhs texted reply to The Telegraph, on Tuesday evening.         
	He further messaged: Dada and me are too self-respecting to cater to all the write-ups You guys should support your team and Dada and make sure the team shines one day Do look at the positives, instead of negatives We, at KKR, respect Dadas genius.         
	So, for now, Sourav should feel secure.         
	Of course, three-and-half-years ago, the Team India dressing room hadnt been big enough for two  Sourav and the then-coach Greg Chappell  and Indias most successful Test captain found himself out in the cold.         
	That bitter experience hasnt been forgotten.         
	Sourav and Buchanan had a one-on-one on Tuesday morning, but neither was available for a reaction. Its highly unlikely that the captaincy issue wouldnt have come up in one form or the other.         
	Somebody close to Sourav did, however, say: Whatever Buchanans views on captaincy, and the different way he wants to approach it, Shah Rukh will almost surely have the last word         
	Sourav is the Knight Riders icon player and the icons are tied to their franchises for three years, till the 2010 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), that is.         
	Buchanan, who boasts a phenomenal record as Australias coach, apparently favours rotating the captaincy between four players  Sourav, West Indies captain Chris Gayle, New Zealand No.2 Brendon McCullum and Australian Brad Hodge.         
	That hasnt been made official and, if implemented, Sourav would lose his position of pre-eminence.         
	Obviously, such a move wont go down well with the Knight Riders fans, who swear by Shah Rukh and Sourav. As for implementation, it would be much easier on neutral territory, rather than in matches at the Eden.         
	So, if the Buchanan Doctrine is actually taken forward, then its just as well that this years edition of the T20 tournament is being held in South Africa.         
	Buchanan, who is keen on developing leaders within the squad, has somewhat radical ideas.         
	For example, if he had his way, then coach Matthew Mott would be the captain when the Knight Riders are batting and, while fielding, the captaincy may be rotated.         
	That could lead to much confusion in such a short game, but Buchanan is likely to push for it. I realise Im accountable, is what hed said the other day.         
	Clearly, it seems Buchanan is all for a soccer-like management.

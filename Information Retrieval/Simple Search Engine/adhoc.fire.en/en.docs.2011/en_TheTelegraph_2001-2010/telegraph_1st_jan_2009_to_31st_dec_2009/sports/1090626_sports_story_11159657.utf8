                                                   Woolmers son thanks Younis 
                      
	Karachi: Dale Woolmer, the son of former Pakistan coach Bob, has said that captain Younis Khans decision to dedicate the World Twenty20 title to his late father was very sweet and lovely.         
	In a letter to the Pakistan Cricket Board, Dale thanked Younis for acknowledging his fathers contribution to Pakistan cricket, saying the gesture had touched the whole family.         
	Bob was found unconscious in his hotel room in Jamaica a day after Pakistans shock defeat to minnows Ireland in the 2007 World Cup (50 over-a-side) in the Caribbean.         
	He later died in a hospital. The Jamaican police initially treated it as murder and investigated Pakistan team members before declaring it a natural death.         
	Bob coached the team from June 2004 until his death in March 2007.         
	Dale recalled his fathers association with the Pakistan team as magnificent.         
	He used to say that Pakistan can be the best team if they believe in themselves and I visited Pakistan on several occasions and found the people of the country as great and hospitable, he wrote in his letter.         
	Dale hoped foreign teams would return to play in Pakistan in the future.         
	It is very important for Pakistan cricket that foreign teams return to the country. I hope the matter is solved in the near future, he wrote.         
	Pakistan beat Sri Lanka by eight wickets to win the World Twenty20 title in England.           (AFP)

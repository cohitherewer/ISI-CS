  - Younis Khan, Graeme Smith feel more could follow Freddie             Andrew Flintoff                           
	London/Karachi: Derek Pringle in his column in an English daily said Thursday: Freelance cricketers are nothing new... But the novelty Andrew Flintoff brings to the genre is that he still wants to represent his country, and that could present problems, big problems.         
	Whatever occurs in the long run, the England all-rounders decision not to sign the ECB contract offered him has his peers taking sides.         
	Flintoff turning freelancer doesnt surprise Younis Khan. The Pakistan skipper feels that cash-rich events, like the IPL and ICL, have changed cricketers outlook and said more players might follow the Lancashire man.         
	But Graeme Smith doesnt see it that way.         
	The South Africa captain said the surprise decision to shun the contract has been influenced by the huge financial rewards that can be reaped nowadays.         
	I think Flintoff got it right... With Twenty20 cricket gaining so much popularity and with more money coming in it could prove to be more beneficial for a professional cricketer to remain freelance, Younis said before leaving for South Africa to take part in the September 22-October 5 Champions Trophy.         
	Younis said that with the kind of money going round nowadays, freelancing could turn into a good career option.         
	Personally I still believe Test cricket is the pinnacle of the sport and nothing matches the honour of playing for your country.         
	But I think professional playerscould now begin to consider freelance careers after some years for their country, he said.         
	Younis said even now, in many countries, former players faced financial problems after retirement, particularly in Pakistan.         
	Thats why we have formed a professional cricketers association. Our aim is to provide relief to deserving former players.         
	Smith fears it could be the beginning of a trend and said the ICC needs to look into the matter seriously and plan the Future Tours Programme in a more meaningful manner so as to avoid a mass exodus.         
	Freds had a very successful career, and at this stage of his career, he wants to maximise his worth and really take control of things.         
	Hes had a number of injuries, and for his own good, he needs to take control of the few years he has left in him, Smith said.         
	I dont think you can blame the individual, but its an interesting time for cricket, and interesting to see where it goes now. The crucial aspect is the decisions the leadership makes in the future.         
	The ICC needs to give cricket a good direction, and crucial to that is how they look at the FTP because the decisions they make around that are going to be so important for the future of the game, Smith told a cricket website.         
	Interestingly, the Professional Cricketers Association (PCA) chief Sean Morris, who has supported Flintoff, too, fears more players will follow in his footsteps.         
	I think, there will be a lot of serious discussion in Johannesburg later this month among the parties and between the parties. I cant overestimate its importance.         
	I think, other players will, like Flintoff, reject contracts from their boards, not necessarily from England but from New Zealand, Sri Lanka and West Indies where the rewards are not nearly so great, Morris was quoted as saying in another English daily.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cant change the past: Shukla
                                                                                                                       7                                      Cant change the past: Shukla
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: On Wednesday, for a change, Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla was in a good mood as he scored a century and the team was boasting of three centurions. The centuries, however, came too late as Bengal are already out of this seasons Ranji Trophy.         
	The pain of not being able to qualify is still there but the skipper doesnt want cry over spilt milk. Rather he would like to take the positives from this match.         
	We should have batted better in the earlier matches which unfortunately didnt happen, he admitted.         
	Look we cant change what has happened. But we can always strive to do better than what we have done in earlier matches. Me and the boys only tried to do that. During the last couple of days we looked like a different side. We should have shown this consistency earlier, he said.         
	A relaxed Shukla asked the waiting mediapersons, whether they liked the six he hit off Aditya Jain to complete his century.         
	Did you guys like that shot? Did you see the distance it travelled? he questioned, and one could sense the satisfaction in his voice.         
	Ask the likes of Ranadeb, Sourashis. When it comes to hitting sixes, no one can hit as long as I do, the sense of pride was clearly there. Interestingly, all the three centurions for Bengal  Sourav Ganguly, Wriddhiman Saha and Shukla  reached the mark scoring off the same bowler  Jain.         
	A first-class century is always satisfying, and getting one against a quality opposition like Delhi makes you feel good, Shukla said.         
	His three earlier first-class centuries came against visiting Bangladesh side (Duleep Trophy), Baroda (Ranji trophy semi-finals in 2005-06) and against Services in the Plate League last year.         
	His last century against Delhi was during a one-day match in Vizag last year. He got a touch emotional while talking about that century.         
	You know Avik (Chowdhury) was at the other end when I completed that century. He gave me good support during his short knock.         
	However, there was disconcerting news for Bengal. Shukla was hit in the rib cage by a short ball from Pradeep Sangwan, and is having a slight breathing problem.         
	Im finding it difficult to breathe at times. I dont know whether I would be in a position to bowl tomorrow (Thursday). I would definitely try, as the first two hours will be crucial. If we can get two or three wickets, you are into the middle and lower-middle order, he added.         
	Shukla admitted that the 249-run stand between Wriddhiman and Sourav was very important. I could play my natural attacking game because of the brilliant batting by Sourav and Wriddhiman. Also the fact that Dinda provided magnificent support towards the end helped me a lot.         
	But why doesnt an attacking player like him bat higher up the order? I am thinking of batting up the order during the East Zone one-dayers early next year. Probably, Ill bat at No.3, he said.         
	Can Bengal hope of getting a favourable result on a pitch that is getting slower with time?         
	Ill definitely like to remain positive. The ball is keeping low and there will be turn. Iresh (Saxena) and Sourashish (Lahiri) are likely to play a vital role in the next two days, he concluded.

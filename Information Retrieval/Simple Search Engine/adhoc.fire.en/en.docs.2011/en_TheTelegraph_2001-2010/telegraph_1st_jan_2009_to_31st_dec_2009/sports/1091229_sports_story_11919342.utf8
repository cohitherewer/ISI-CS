  - Premier League 
  -  Smalling own goal seals Fulham fate; Spurs move up to fourth place         THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Didier Drogba celebrates after scoring against Fulham during Chelseas EPL match, in London, on Monday. (AP)                                 
	Chelsea overcame a real scare at the hands of Fulham but eventually stretched their lead at the top of the Premier League to five points with a vital victory.         
	Didier Drogba equalised midway through the second half after Zoltan Gera gave Fulham the early lead, and an own goal from Chris Smalling  on his League debut  settled the game in Chelseas favour.         
	With Jose Mourinho watching from the stands, Carlo Ancelotti made six changes to the Chelsea side which drew with Birmingham on Boxing Day, with Ricardo Carvalho, Yuri Zhirkov and Paulo Ferreira coming into the back four.         
	But Chelseas defence was breached after just four minutes.         
	Paul Konchesky found space on the left and his cross deceived Terry and the England skipper watched in horror as Bobby Zamora, stationed six yards out, found Gera.         
	The Hungarian was stood at point blank range but still had work to do as he controlled the ball, turned and planted his shot beyond Petr Cech.         
	Terry required lengthy treatment after taking a kick in the face from team-mate Zhirkov that left him with a painful-looking bruise beneath the right eye.         
	Cech had to palm a shot by Clint Dempsey over the crossbar after the American had been expertly set up by Zamora, whose physical presence was causing Chelsea problems.         
	Chelsea enjoyed a lucky escape seconds after the interval when poorly-judged backpass by Carvalho was intercepted by Zamora, whose shot cannoned off the leg of the advancing Petr Cech.         
	Chelsea replaced John Obi Mikel with Daniel Sturridge and Fulham brought on Andy Johnson for Gera as the match entered the final 20 minutes.         
	But it was another replacement  Branislav Ivanovic  who set up Drogbas headed equaliser with a right-wing cross.         
	Relieved and inspired, Chelsea took the lead two minutes later when confusion in the Fulham defence led to a heartbreaking moment for Smalling.         
	At White Hart Lane, Luka Modric marked his return to Tottenhams starting lineup by scoring the opener against West Ham.         
	Modric, who has been restricted to two brief substitute appearances since breaking his right leg in August, scored in the 11th by sweeping Aaron Lennons cross into the net.         
	Lennon also fed Jermain Defoe in 81st and the former West Ham striker fired home after keeper Robert Green parried his initial shot.         
	Weve got a fantastic squad, great players and I think were good enough to compete up there, Defoe said.         
	The victory lifted Tottenham to fourth with 37 points, one behind Arsenal but two ahead of Aston Villa, who host Liverpool on Tuesday.         
	West Ham are a point above the relegation zone having played three more matches than 18th-place Bolton.         
	Birmingham climbed above Liverpool into seventh after Cameron Jerome clinched a 1-0 win at Stoke.         
	At Goodison Park, Everton ended a seven-match winless streak in the league by beating 10-man Burnley 2-0, with both goals coming after Stephen Jordan was sent off for the visitors.         
	James Vaughan broke the deadlock in the 83rd, with his first goal in two years coming seconds after he went on as a substitute.         
	Steven Pienaar added another in stoppage time.         
	Blackburn and Sunderland played out a 2-2 draw at Ewood Park with all the goals coming in the second half. Darren Bents opener for Sunderland was quickly cancelled out by Morten Gamst Pedersen.         
	The visitors regained the lead against the run of play in the 65th when Bent netted his 13th goal of the season.

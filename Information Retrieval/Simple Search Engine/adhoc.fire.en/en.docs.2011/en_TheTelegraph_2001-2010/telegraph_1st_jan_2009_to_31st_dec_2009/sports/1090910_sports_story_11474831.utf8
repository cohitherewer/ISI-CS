The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chidi loses head, does a Zidane
                                                     Chidi loses head, does a Zidane
            A STAFF REPORTER            Rakesh Masih (left) and Edeh Chidi, after the latter was shown the red card on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Wednesdays IFA Shield semi-final between Mohun Bagan and Chirag United reminded one of Zinedine Zidane  but for the wrong reasons.         
	Memories of Zidanes infamous headbutting of Italian Marco Materazzi in the final of the 2006 World Cup were rekindled when Mohun Bagans Nigerian striker Edeh Chidi, after an altercation with Eduardo, headbutted the Brazilian in the 10th minute of the match.         
	With blood flowing from the resultant cut on Eduardos nose, Chidi was issued the red card. But the striker refused to leave the ground and had to be dragged out by the Bagan officials after he threatened to attack Eduardo again. Coach Karim Bencharifa, on the other hand, was seen arguing with assistant referee A. Arjunan for almost the rest of the first half.         
	The Moroccan questioned the standard of refereeing as he said: If Chidi deserved a red card, so did Eduardo I personally feel that yellow for both could have been a better option.         
	The assistant referee was far from the point of incident and his briefing the referee didnt make sense. He was the same man who officiated in our match against Mahindra United and took some controversial decisions then too. Im really worried with the refereeing ahead of the final (against Churchill Brothers on Saturday), he added.         
	Defending his on-field argument, Bencharifa said: Football is a game of nerves. I was a bit frustrated with the situation and so tried to put across the point to him.         
	Commenting on his 10-man teams triumph, the coach said: We gave them a lesson in tactical discipline and organisational play today.         
	Asked about the gamble of replacing Shilton Paul with Sangram Mukherjee for the tie-breakers, the Moroccan grinned as he said: Well, Im a young coach I may not be a good coach, but Im certainly a lucky coach         
	Bencharifas counterpart, Subrata Bhattacharya, accused Bagan of playing negative football. We played better football today.         
	Its a pity that we couldnt convert the openings which we created. Mohun Bagan were more interested in time wasting tactics. You dont really expect such negative football from such a big team. They were no better than any second division side of the local league, Subrata fumed.

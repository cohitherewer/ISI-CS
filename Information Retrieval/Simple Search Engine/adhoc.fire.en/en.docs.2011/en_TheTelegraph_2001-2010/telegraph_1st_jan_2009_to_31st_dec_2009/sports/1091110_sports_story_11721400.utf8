	Mumbai: Missing key players and coming off a disappointing draw in their opening match, defending champions Mumbai would aim to bring their Ranji Trophy campaign back on track when they face Orissa in a Super League Group A match here Tuesday.         
	Mumbai will miss the services of top-order batsmen Ajinkya Rahane and Rohit Sharma, all-rounder Abhishek Nayar and off-spinner Ramesh Powar.         
	While Rahane, Sharma and Nayar have been named in the Board Presidents XI squad, Powar has been ruled out for 10 days following an injury he sustained during the teams previous match against Punjab.         
	The hosts have named left-hander Praful Waghela, wicketkeeper Aditya Tare, batsman Prashant Naik and pacer Usman Malvi as replacements.         
	Mumbai, who in their opening match, had let Punjab off the hook after gaining a massive first-innings lead of 212, have three points from one match.         
	Meanwhile, the visitors would hope their batsmen would fire against a quality attack led by Indian speedster Zaheer Khan and veteran Ajit Agarkar, to make amends for the disappointing show against Gujarat.

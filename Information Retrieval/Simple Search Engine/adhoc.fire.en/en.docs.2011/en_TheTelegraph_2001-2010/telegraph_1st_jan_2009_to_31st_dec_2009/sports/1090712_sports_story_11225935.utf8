The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Colaco offers help in Bhaichung case
                                                     Colaco offers help in Bhaichung case
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT    
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) general secretary, Alberto Colaco is ready to mediate between Bhaichung Bhutia and Mohun Bagan to help find a solution to the impasse.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph Saturday, Colaco said his intention was to speed up the process and that he would do anything to make it possible.         
	The matter will be discussed in the AIFF emergency committee meeting on July 22, Colaco said. I will not hesitate to take up the responsibility if the committee asks me to mediate.         
	I could guess that both sides were anxious about the time factor. The problem should be solved as soon as possible, he added.         
	While Colaco was hopeful that the deadlock could be broken soon, some other AIFF officials remained sceptical. According to them, the federation has only complicated things by sending the matter to the Players Status Committee (PSC).         
	A simple issue has been made complicated, said another official. First, rules on release of footballers by clubs have been laid down.         
	The Bhaichung issue has to be resolved under these rules only.         
	Second, the matter regarding the suspension of Bhaichung has to be solved as per the IFA rules. In fact, in both the cases, the IFA has to take the lead. They cannot run away from the problem, the official added.         
	A section in the AIFF also feels that the emergency committee has no power to take a decision in this case.         
	At most, they may refer the matter back to the IFA and get the AIFF disciplinary committee involved to have a look at the suspension issue.

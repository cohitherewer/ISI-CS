The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav plots Yusufs fall
                                                                                                                                   Sourav plots Yusufs fall
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri attributed the prized scalp of Yusuf Pathan on Tuesday to Sourav Gangulys captains acumen. It was sweet revenge for the offie who had been clobbered by Pathan senior during their last meeting in 2007-08 at the Motibaug ground.         
	I feel satisfied as I could successfully execute what Sourav told me. Yusuf was trying the slog sweep in the first over and sustained a muscle pull.         
	Dada came up at the end of the over and told me to keep a man at short square leg, which will induce him to go for the lofted shot.         
	As his feet movement was hampered after the first over, it was a chance we took keeping in mind that he may not be able to reach for the lofted shot, and it paid off, Lahiri said at the end of the days play.         
	Baroda coach Paras Mhambrey, however, defended Yusufs shot selection. Thats how Yusuf plays. He is a proven match winner for us. Whether it is the first or the last ball of the day, this is how he bats. He went for his shot but wasnt successful, Mhambrey said.         
	He praised Irfan Pathan and Pinal Shah for showing great application when the team was in the dumps.         
	The wicket had a bit of green, something I havent seen at Eden Gardens in recent years. Irfan and Pinal showed great character. It required a lot of application as Bengal bowlers were on top during that phase.         
	Mhambrey pointed out that they would like to bat at least two sessions on Wednesday. On the other hand, Bengal captain Shukla said he would be satisfied if his bowlers could restrict Baroda to another 40-50 runs.         
	The first hour as usual would be crucial as the wicket is easing out after that. I am happy with the way we bowled and hope to wrap it up quickly tomorrow (Wednesday), Shukla said.

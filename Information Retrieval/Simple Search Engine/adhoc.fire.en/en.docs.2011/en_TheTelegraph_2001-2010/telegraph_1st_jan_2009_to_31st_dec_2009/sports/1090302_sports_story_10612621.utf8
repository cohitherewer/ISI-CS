The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahindra pump four past Vasco
                                                   Mahindra pump four past Vasco
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mahindra United finally found their goal-scoring touch as they defeated basement club Vasco SC 4-0 in a 17th round I-League match at the Cooperage, here on Sunday.         
	A brace from Mohammed Rafi and a strike each from Sushil Kumar Singh and Edeh Chidi saw the hosts end their three-match winless run.         
	Derrick Pereiras men began strongly. Sushanth Mathew and Sukhvinder Singh were vibrant in the midfield, creating a few chances for the forwards.         
	Chidi almost scored in the 22nd minute when he was left unmarked inside the Vasco penalty area but the Nigerians header off a Rafi cross went wide.         
	A few minutes later, Chidi set up Sushant in front of the Vasco goal, but the latter shot over the bar.         
	Mahindras persistence eventually paid off in the 31st minute when Sushil, receiving a cross from Sushant, blasted it into the net.         
	Four minutes later, Rafi got the better of a Vasco defender and then dodged past rival goalkeeper Lakshmikant Kattimani to stretch the lead.         
	Chidi made it 3-0 in the very next minute and the scoreline remained the same at half time.         
	After the change of ends, the spark was missing in Mahindras play and it was not until the 76th minute that they scored again, Rafi breaking through the right flank to net his second goal of the match.

    - IFA Shield 
  -   I-League champions enter final             A STAFF REPORTER            Air Indias Uttam Singh heads during the IFA Shield semi-final against Churchill Brothers at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: They say the grass is greener on the other side. But the adage would not stand for Tuesdays IFA Shield semi-final clash between Churchill Brothers and Air India, where excellent ground conditions were in stark contrast to the indolent performance of both the teams.         
	Slushy and unplayable turfs are the usual norm, during monsoon, for football in the city.         
	So when the lush green carpet welcomed one at the Salt Lake Stadium, expectations of watching a good brand of football were always there.         
	Still football, on Tuesday, was scrappy at its best. And after 120 minutes of drudgery, Churchill entered the final edging past the Mumbai outfit 5-3 (1-1 after full time).         
	Churchill, the favourites, began encouragingly with Naoba Singh unleashing a powerful free-kick in the fifth minute which was thwarted by a diving Arnab Das Sharma.         
	But it was Air India who drew first blood against the run of play. Soccer Velho, in the 14th minute, latched on to a stray ball and ran down the right flank before essaying a goal-bound cross. Churchill defender Rowilson Rodrigues went for a sliding clearance but all he managed was a deflection into his own goal!         
	Stung by the surprise goal, Churchill pressed hard, pushing forward players in numbers. They switched on to a 3-5-2 formation trying to take control of the midfield.         
	The Goan side concentrated on stiching together ground passes and movement through the middle.         
	But in the absence of a quality midfielder, who could orchestrate the game, all of Churchills forays were more of misadventures than constructive build-ups.         
	One wondered whether more wing play was the need of the day.         
	Air India squandered a chance in the 25th minute when Dada Nabeel did all the good work in getting past a host of defenders only to waste it with a feeble effort with only the goalkeeper at his mercy.         
	In the second half, while the Bimal Ghosh-coached Mumbai side crowded their defence, Churchill kept pushing hard. Their efforts bore fruit in the 76th minute when Reisangme Vashum outwitted two rival defenders before his left-footer sailed past an out-of-position Arnab.         
	With the teams tied 1-1 even after the extra-time, penalty shootouts were the decider.         
	Air Indias Kailash Patil and Vijith Shetty were off-target as Carlos Pereiras Churchill Brothers made it to the summit clash.         
	For the winners, Ogba Kalu, Naveen Sudhakaran, Gourmangi Singh and Nascimento Silveira scored while Vashums effort was saved by the goalkeeper. Harpreet Singh and Vijith Shetty were the scorers for Air India.         
	Unfortunately, there wasnt a Man of the Match award for Tuesdays tie. Had there been one, the artificial turf would have surely won the award.

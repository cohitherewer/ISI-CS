	Karachi: Pakistan may be celebrating their World Twenty20 victory but national team coach Intikhab Alam advised his cricketers to switch their focus to the Sri Lanka tour commencing on Saturday.         
	Alam said that it was important that the cricketers turn their focus to the upcoming series in Sri Lanka as now they have to live up to the expectation of the country.         
	I am confident they will manage to switch to the Test mode quickly and comfortably because more responsibilities and pressures are now on us to do well in Sri Lanka, he said on Monday.         
	Meanwhile, Pakistan selectors recalled senior batsman Mohammed Yousuf on Monday for the Test tour of Sri Lanka but ignored fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar. They also recalled all-rounder Abdul Razzaq, who was rushed to the World Twenty20 after snapping ties with the ICL.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vijay breaks course record, in joint lead
                                                   Vijay breaks course record, in joint lead
                      
	Panchkula: Vijay Kumar shot a whirlwind 64 to break the course record and become joint leader along with Gaganjeet Bhullar at the end of the third round of the PGTI Players Championship here on Saturday.         
	Vijay and Bhullar have an identical total of 12 under 204 and Harendra Gupta of Chandigarh is four strokes behind the joint leaders in third place.         
	Vijay Kumar (72, 68 and 64) set the Panchkula Golf Club on fire when he broke the course record of seven under 65, earlier held jointly by Bhullar and Karanjit Singh Sandhu.         
	Interestingly, Bhullar had equalled Sandhus course record during the first round on Thursday.         
	Vijays bogey-free round of eight-under 64 saw him make an incredible six birdies (first, third, fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth) on the front nine. He added two more birdies (10th, 18th) to his tally on the back nine.         
	The 40-year-old, who last won a professional event about three years back, made 16 regulations and excelled with the putter through the day.         
	My hitting was excellent today and I missed regulation only on the second and fourth holes. I hit it really close on most occasions and did not miss too many putts either, especially on the front nine, said Vijay.         
	Its been a long time since I won an event. So it feels great to be in joint lead at this stage, Vijay added.           (AGENCIES)

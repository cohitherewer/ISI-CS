                                                                                                                       7                                      3 Indians at 2nd spot
                      
	Khon Kaen (Thailand): Calcutta pro Rahil Gangjee brought home a sensational course-record equalling eight-under 64 to join compatriots Anirban Lahiri and Harmeet Kahlon at the second place after the halfway stage of the Kings Cup golf tournament on Friday.         
	As many as six players trail Chan Yih-shin (137) from just one stroke behind and half of them are Indians.         
	Gangjee, whose lone Asian Tour title came at the Volkswagen Masters-China in 2004, is now fancying a second triumph as is Kahlon, winner of the 2002 Hero Honda Masters.         
	Among other Indians in the fray, Indian Open winner C. Muniyappa and veteran Gaurav Ghei were tied 11th at four-under 140, three shots ahead of Digvijay Singh who lay tied 32nd. Firoz Ali and Manav Jaini share the 52nd place at 146. (PTI)

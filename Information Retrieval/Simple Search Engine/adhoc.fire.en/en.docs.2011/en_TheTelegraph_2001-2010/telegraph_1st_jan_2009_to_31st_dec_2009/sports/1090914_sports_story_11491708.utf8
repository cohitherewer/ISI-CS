                                                   Leander beats Bhupathi to win title
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	New York: Leander Paes and his Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy won the US Open doubles title defeating Mahesh Bhupathi and Bahamian Mark Knowles 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 in the final at the Flushing Meadows, here on Sunday. The Indian duo were playing against each for the first time in a Slam final.         
	This was Leanders second Grand Slam doubles title of the year. Leander and Dlouhy had earlier won the Franch Open.         
	The doubles final assumed importance since the Indian duo refuse to yield even an inch when playing against each other.         
	From the pinnacle to the depths, the relationship between Paes and Bhupathi has fluctuated, turning from great to bad to worse.         
	The two forged a formidable partnership in the late 90s and steeply climbed the ladder of the doubles rankings.         
	They played so well as a team such that it prompted the then top Australian doubles pair of Mark Woodforde and Todd Woodbridge (known as the Woodies) to predict that they expected Bhupathi and Paes to take their place in tennis doubles after they left the scene.         
	Together with Paes, Bhupathi featured in several memorable Grand Slam matches, Olympic matches as well as Davis Cup matches for India.         
	Their pairing was so strong and reliable that it was normally a scoreline of 1-0 in any Davis cup clash even before the first single was played, meaning that the doubles match on the second day would be in Indias favour.         
	From such a high, the relationship between the pair gradually deteriorated and reached a point of no communication. The exact cause or causes for the rift has never been known so far though various factors like ego clashes, each player garnering more attention than the other have been rumoured over the years.         
	Just after winning the 2006 Asian Games, both of the players announced that they would never play again together.         
	In spite of the cold relationship between them, they decided to play together in the Beijing 2008 Olympics for a possible medal chance in the doubles event.         
	Bhupathi had initially shot a letter to the All India Tennis Association stating that he did not want to play with Paes in the Olympic Games preferring Bopanna instead as his partner.         
	Bhupathi had said, Leander and I are best option for India but we need to go with some kind of preparation. We need to build a team. Its not about past performances. Rohan Bopanna and I are better prepared as a team.

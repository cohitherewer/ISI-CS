	Baku (Azerbaijan): Asian champion Suranjoy Singh (51kg) humbled Olympic bronze medallist Vincenzo Picardi in the quarter finals to assure himself a medal in the season-ending Presidents Cup Boxing tournament here Wednesday.         
	Representing the Asia One team, the Indian won 6-4 in his opening bout and will now take on Mexicos Braulio Avila, who is competing for Americas Two team, in the semi-final Thursday.         
	In a bout he dominated from the start, Suranjoy unsettled his Italian opponent with his very first blow and led 4-1 at the end of the first three minutes.         
	I didnt even know that he is an Olympic bronze medallist. I was just focussed on keeping my cool because a lot of time in the past, I have lost because of my temper, the 22-year-old said.         
	Suranjoy adopted a guarded approach in the second round and denied his rival any chance to come back in the bout. (PTI)

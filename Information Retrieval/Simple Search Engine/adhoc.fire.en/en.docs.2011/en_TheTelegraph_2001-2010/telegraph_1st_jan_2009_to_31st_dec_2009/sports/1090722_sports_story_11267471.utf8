                                                   Banglas historic win in WI
    - Stand-in captain Shakib-al hasan named man of the match and series                                   
	St Georges: Stand-in captain Shakib-al Hasan hit an unbeaten 96 Monday to guide Bangladesh to their first overseas series win with a four-wicket victory over the West Indies in the second Test.         
	Shakib, who earlier completed a five-wicket haul with his left-arm spin, guided his team to their target late on day four.         
	The 22-year-old Shakib, in his first Test as skipper, stroked 13 fours and ended the match with a six over long on to take his side to 217 for six. His innings spanned 97 balls and 162 minutes.         
	Shakib and right-hander Raqibul Hasan shared a match-winning partnership of 106, which revived Bangladesh from the peril of 67 for four midway through the day.         
	Medium pacer Darren Sammy led a spirited effort from the strike-weakened West Indies team with a haul of five for 55 and a brilliant catch.         
	This is the best day for Bangladesh cricket, Shakib said after collecting the series trophy and the Man of the Match and Man of the Series awards. This will boost our confidence and we hope to take it to the next level and go forward.         
	Shakib claimed 13 wickets in the series and also scored 159 runs. It was a good series for me, although I didnt score in the first Test. But I came good in the second Test, he said. The boys have been supporting me really well, all the coaching staff have been supporting me, so I dont have any pressure.         
	Play was delayed more than two hours because of morning rain, but Bangladesh wrapped up the West Indies second innings for the addition of just 17 runs on resumption. The home team, overnight 192 for eight, were bowled out for 209 just before lunch.         
	Bangladesh openers Tamim Iqbal and Imrul Kayes provided an opening partnership of 27 either side of lunch before the West Indies dominated the second session.         
	Fast bowler Kemar Roach made the breakthrough as Imrul (8) slashed off the back foot and Sammy leapt high at second slip to take the catch.         
	Two runs later, Tamim departed as he nibbled at Sammy and provided a catch to wicket-keeper Chadwick Walton.         
	Raqibul and left-hander Junaid Siddique nervously added 20 for the third wicket before Sammy maintained the home teams grip with two more wickets.         
	Siddique (5) played across the line and deflected low to Floyd Reifer at first slip at 49 for three.         
	Mohammed Ashrafuls lean tour continued when he edged a fine leg-cutter to Walton at 67 for four.         
	Raqibul and Shakib played a few streaky strokes early on in their innings before settling down to forge their match-winning stand.         
	Sammy kept West Indies fading hopes alive by claiming Raqibul to a juggled return catch at 173 for five. The St Lucian added the scalp of Mushfiqur Rahim in almost identical fashion at 201 for six.         
	The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said it had awarded a cash bonus of $214,000 to the national team for their defeat of the West Indies to clinch the sides first overseas Test series win.

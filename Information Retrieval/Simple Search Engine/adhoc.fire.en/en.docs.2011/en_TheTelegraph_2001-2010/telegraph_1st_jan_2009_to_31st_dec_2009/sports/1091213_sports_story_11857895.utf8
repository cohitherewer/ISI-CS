The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | De Ridder: A fantastic performance
                                                                                                                       7                                      De Ridder: A fantastic performance
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal coach Philippe de Ridder was a happy man on Saturday. A fantastic performance keeping in mind that we did not have a striker to field, the Belgian said at the post match conference.         
	East Bengal were not keen to play this match and had asked for the release of Syed Rahim Nabi and one of the either Mehrajuddin Wadoo, Govin Singh or Subhas Singh. The players could have been released given that the All India Football Federation could not line-up a replacement for Iraq, which was orginally slotted for Saturday, shelved the plan for a friendly.         
	But national coach Bob Houghton did not want to set a bad precedent and point blank said no to Indian Football Association secretary Utpal Ganguli on Friday. Interestingly in the evenings, Mehrajuddin, along with Steven Dias, Sunil Chetri and Subhasish Roy Choudhury are busy rehearsing the steps for the Football Players Association of India (FPAI) awards night to be held in the city on Sunday.         
	An All India Football Federation source said Ganguli has already sent the letter protesting Houghtons bad behaviour. I sincerely hope that the matter gets due importance at the AIFF meeting, the source said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Black Caps win a thriller
                                                     Black Caps win a thriller
          
	Colombo: New Zealand beat Sri Lanka by three runs in a thrilling Twenty20 match at the R. Premadasa Stadium on Wednesday.         
	Set a victory target of 142, Sri Lanka appeared to be cruising after scoring 85 from the first 10 overs, with opener Tillekaratne Dilshan hitting 57 off 28 balls.         
	But the hosts lost Sanath Jayasuriya (1) and Mahela Jayawardene (3) cheaply. Kumar Sangakkara (13), debutant Gihan Rupasinghe (15) and Anjelo Mathews (21) all made good starts but failed to build on them.         
	New Zealand seamer Jacob Oram picked up three wickets for 33 while skipper Daniel Vettori took two for 11 with his accurate left-arm spin.         
	Earlier Ross Taylor top-scored for New Zealand with 60 from 45 balls to lift the Black Caps to a modest 141 for 8 after Vettori had won the toss and elected to bat.         
	Taylor combined with Martin Guptill for 53 off 41 balls before Guptill was out for 29, caught by Chamara Kapugedera off spinner Bandara.         
	Taylors score, his third Twenty20 half-century, included five fours and a six.         
	He was caught by Nuwan Kulasekera off seamer Mathews.         
	Medium pacer Lasith Malinga was the pick of the Sri Lankan bowlers, taking two wickets in the last over to finish with figures of two for 21.                 (AP)

                                                   Pawan to play for Barisha
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: He claims to be a die-hard Sourav Ganguly fan and now Pawan Sharma, the rookie pacer who attended the Kolkata Knight Riders fitness camp at the Eden, is set to represent Barisha Sporting, the former India captains club, in the CAB league.         
	Pawan, who has a Shoaib Akhtar-like bowling action, impressed everyone with his speed. Bengal chief selector Sambaran Banerjee had a look at the 18-year-old pacer at the CABs indoor facility on Friday and was pleased with the rookies pace.         
	He bowls with a lively pace and is very impressive. He can be useful if he gets proper coaching, Sambaran said.         
	Pawan has been asked to attend the Knights next camp, which may happen at the end of September or early October. Sambaran has assured the youngster that he will be able to practice at the former Bengal captains academy before the next camp.         
	Pawan hails from a village 20km from Agra, and says, he begins practice at 3 in the morning. I usually train from 3 to 7 in the morning. But I will try and increase that as this camp has infused enthusiasm in me.

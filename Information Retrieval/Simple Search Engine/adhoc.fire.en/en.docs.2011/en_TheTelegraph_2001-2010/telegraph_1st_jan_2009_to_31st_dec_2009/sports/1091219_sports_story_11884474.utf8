The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians stay away from fourth floor
                                                                                                                       7                                      Indians stay away from fourth floor
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Nagpur: Call it being superstitious or give it another name, but the Team India cricketers insisted on not staying on the fourth floor of the official hotel (Pride) here.         
	Reason? Sreesanth caught the swine flu while being on that floor when the team had come for the December 9 T20 International. Confirmation of his illness, though, came only in Chandigarh.         
	The rooms on the fourth floor are spacious, but we put our foot down (on Wednesday)... Eventually, that floor got allotted to the Sri Lankans, a senior Indian cricketer told The Telegraph before Fridays ODI.         
	Barring a couple of them, the Indians took rooms on the second floor.         
	Sreesanth, it may be recalled, didnt play that T20 and has been off cricket for almost a fortnight.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India settle for 3rd spot
                                                   India settle for 3rd spot
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Indian women settled the small matter of pride against Australia in their third-fourth place playoff at Bankstown Oval with a comfortable three wicket victory, finishing third in a competition in which, but for the occasional slip-up, they have fared honourably. After all, their two defeats in the event have come against finalists England and New Zealand.         
	The playoff victory was Indias second successive over the dethroned world champions, having already beaten them once in the Super Six stage.         
	On Saturday, it was the bowlers turn to bother the Australians as four of them, Jhulan Goswami, Priyanka Roy, Rumeli Dhar and Gouher Sultana, scalped two each to skittle out the hosts for 142 in 44.4 overs in the rain truncated 46 over match.         
	Chasing, India put together small but useful partnerships to overhaul the target in 43.5 overs. Sulakshana Naik top-scored with 28 while Rumeli Dhar chipped in with a priceless 24 not out.         
	For the hosts only three batters could manage double digit scores.

            BIPIN SHENOY            Surya Sekhar                           
	Calcutta: National champion and Grandmaster Surya Sekhar Ganguly clinched the Asian Continental Chess Championship with a draw against GM Zhou Jianchao of China at Subic, Olongapo City in the Philippines in the final round on Saturday.         
	Surya Sekhar, who scored eight points along with GM Zhou Weiqi of China, was declared champion on better tie-break. The top ten from the meet qualify for the World Cup scheduled to be held in Siberia in November.         
	Indian Grandmasters Sandipan Chanda, K. Sasikiran and Abhijit Kunte also made the cut for the World Cup.         
	I am satisfied with my play in this championship, an elated Surya Sekhar told The Telegraph immediately after his final round.         
	Both my wins against Vietnam GM Le Quang Liem and GM Antonio Rogelio Jr were particularly satisfying as they were, in my opinion, sharp, precise and technically perfect .         
	Surya said his stint with Viswanathan Anand as his second in the World Championship helped him a lot. I am grateful to Anand as working with him broadened my vision and has had a very positive impact on my game, he added.         
	Before this meet I had taken a break for two months and prepared with GM Sandipan Chanda and IM Atanu Lahiri alternately. I believe the short spells with these two have also proved very useful, said Surya Sekhar.         
	Even during the championship I used to work with Sandipan, who was also my room-mate.         
	I have also worked hard to improve my stamina and physical fitness. I worked extensively with Kuntal Roy, my physical trainer, and that has also paid rich dividends.

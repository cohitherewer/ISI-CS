The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Inty lashes out at ex-players
                                                   Inty lashes out at ex-players
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam has lashed out at former players for making alleging there is groupism in the team whenever Pakistan do not do well.         
	It is nothing new in Pakistan cricket, but I can only urge our former players not to do things which will damage their own team, he said from Colombo, following their Test series defeat to Sri Lanka.         
	Alam noted that even when Pakistan were not doing well in the Twenty20 World Cup, some former players and critics had talked about discord within the team. But we went on to win the World Cup and silenced our critics, he added.         
	Intikhab said he and the players were utterly disappointed and sad over the statements emanating from Pakistan.         
	The Pakistan coach also refused to run down the senior players in the side for the defeats in Sri Lanka, insisting that no player lost his wicket or performed badly on purpose.         
	No player wants to fail and I think our senior players are going through a bad time, he said.         
	When pointed out that captain Younis Khan had made some stinging comments about the performance of the senior players, Intikhab said he did not agree with those remarks.         
	Alam also made it clear that senior all-rounder Abdul Razzaq did not command a place in the Test side at present and so, was not fielded.         
	He said Pakistan lost both Tests because of inept batting and they needed to work on that in the final Test.         
	I am not giving excuses but the fact is that for the last two years, we have just been playing one-dayers or Twenty20 matches. So, obviously, our performance in Tests was going to be affected, he said.         
	He also dismissed allegations by former chief selector Abdul Qadir that he and manager Yawar Saeed had combined to keep fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar out of the squad. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhonis men are the best, says Ramiz
                                                   Dhonis men are the best, says Ramiz
                      
	Karachi: The Indian side under Mahendra Singh Dhoni is presently the best cricket team in the world and they would have little difficulty in crushing New Zealand, predicted former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja.         
	They are the team to beat at the moment. They have this ability to adjust and adapt to all conditions and that is their greatest strength, Raja told on Sunday.         
	The former Test opener, said Indias main strength was that they studied their opponents closely and executed their plans properly on the field. Their execution of plan is top class, courtesy their captain, (MS) Dhoni who has led the side from the front, he said.         
	Ramiz said he would compare Indias present team with the Pakistani side of the 90s.         
	In those days we had a top class bowling attack and also strong batsmen. I see India in a similar position. But they have gone one step further that they have beaten Australia in Australia (in ODI) which we could not do, Ramiz added. He also brushed aside talk about India facing problems in New Zealand.         
	I dont think so. Comparing the present New Zealand team I dont think they have the bowling depth to trouble the Indian batting which is strong in both versions of the game, he said.         
	But another former Test captain Mushtaq Mohammad felt Dhoni would face a litmus test in New Zealand.         
	New Zealand has the most difficult conditions for batting, he said. (PTI)

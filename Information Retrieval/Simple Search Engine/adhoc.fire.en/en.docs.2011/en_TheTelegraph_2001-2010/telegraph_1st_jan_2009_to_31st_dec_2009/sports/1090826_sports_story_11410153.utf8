                                                     Mickey Arthur: We dont settle for mediocrity...
    - A Telegraph Exclusive 
  -   South Africas coach on his teams climb to the top             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mickey Arthur                                 
	Calcutta: The Hansie Cronje-Bob Woolmer partnership promised much, but delivered little.         
	Exactly a decade after the end of that era (sadly, both Cronje and Woolmer are no more), the Graeme Smith-Mickey Arthur partnership has taken South Africa to the very top, in both Tests and ODIs.         
	Australias 1-2 defeat in the Ashes, on Sunday, gave the No.1 Test ranking to South Africa. The top position in ODIs had been claimed earlier this year.         
	Clearly, 2009 has been fantastic for South Africa and somebody who deserves much praise is Arthur, who is content to stay in the background.         
	Smith (captain for over six years), too, is in somewhat the same mould. Generally, he allows his bat to do the talking.         
	As for Cronje and Woolmer, both enjoyed a high profile and were rarely far away from the headlines.         
	The difference in the team environment between then and now is pronounced.         
	Arthur, who has completed four years as coach, spoke to The Telegraph on Tuesday afternoon. In keeping with his style, the 41-year-old didnt seek to take any credit.         
	Incidentally, on a matter of principle, about a year-and-a-half ago, Arthur had put his neck on the line. Its his vision which prevailed.         
	Just as well and, today, he stands vindicated.                 
	The following are excerpts                 
	Whether a dream has been realised         
	(Laughs) Certainly one part of our dream, the other is to remain No.1 in both Tests and ODIs... We wouldnt like to get into a comfort zone, for we realise the perils of doing so... Id love to think that the era of domination by South Africa has started.         
	Celebrations         
	Actually, nothing really Right now, were in different parts of the country, this being our off-season Graeme and I did have a chat on the phone, though...         
	Bonding with Smith         
	Weve gelled well as we share a common vision.         
	South Africas challengers         
	Look, Australia are now No.4 in Tests, but theres never a weak Australian team... Sri Lanka in home conditions, India, England... Those teams will always be there or thereabouts and the competition cannot be underestimated.         
	Challenge No.1         
	To stay at the top in both forms... Weve got a good work ethic, a happy team environment and a committed bunch... The challenge is to remain No.1.         
	What has made the difference         
	Having a settled team has helped... Everybody has a clear role and, as important, everybody is clear about his role... We dont settle for mediocrity and theres no ambiguity about the goals.         
	The pressure factor         
	Yes, Im aware the pressure is going to be more... Its not that well be putting ourselves under more pressure, but the expectations are bound to be greater.         
	Whether its an advantage or a disadvantage that the September 22-October 5 Champions Trophy is at home         
	We certainly like playing at home, but I accept that the expectations-driven pressure could be more... However, you wont find us complaining.         
	Next team meeting         
	On Friday, when the Champions Trophy squad assembles in Potchefstroom. Well be having a conditioning camp there.         
	Long break before the next Test series         
	Yes, theres no Test cricket till we host England at the end of this year.         
	[South Africas last Test, in fact, was against Australia in March.]         
	Role played by him         
	I play a supporting hand, the hard work is put in by the players... Ive only created an environment for the team to go forward and the players have embraced it... Theyre the ones whove made the South African brand of cricket so successful.         
	Those hes thankful to besides the players         
	(Cricket South Africa chief executive) Gerald Majola, for backing my plans... My management team, for their enthusiastic support...         
	His Ashes prediction         
	(Laughs) Before the contest got under way, Id expected Australia to win 2-1. As it turned out, England regained the Ashes with exactly that margin!         
	Finally, whether he sympathises with Australia         
	I do, but as Ive said, theres never a weak Australian team... In the days ahead, that shouldnt be forgotten.         
	Note: The top five in Tests (first) and ODIs are: South Africa, Sri Lanka, India, Australia, England; South Africa, India, Australia, England, New Zealand.

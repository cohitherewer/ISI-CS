The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | An all-Federer affair at Wimbledon in 2030?
                                                     An all-Federer affair at Wimbledon in 2030?
    - Wife Mirka gives birth to twin girls in Zurich             Mark Hodgkinson            Roger Federer with wife Mirka                                 
	What chance of Roger Federers twin girls gracing Wimbledon turf in years to come?         
	Will the womens final at the 2030 Wimbledon Championships be an all-Federer affair? As soon as Roger Federer had announced that he had become a father for the first time, with his wife Mirka, a former tennis player, giving birth to twin girls Thursday, the speculation began as to whether Myla Rose and Charlene Riva will end up playing each other on Wimbledons Centre Court in years to come.         
	Weve had the Williams girls; now meet the Federer sisters. Probably only Andre Agassi and Steffi Grafs children have better Wimbledon genes.         
	For Federer, the best day of his life didnt come on Centre Court this month, when he became the most successful man in Grand Slam history, and then put on a tracksuit top embroidered with a golden 15 to remind everyone just how many Slam titles he had won, but on a maternity ward in Switzerland when Mirka gave birth to the possible Wimbledon champions of the future. Perhaps Myla and Charlene could play doubles together. I have some exciting news to share with everyone, Federer said. Late last night (Thursday), in Switzerland, Mirka and I became proud parents of twin girls. We named them Myla Rose and Charlene Riva and they are both healthy, and, along with their mother, they are doing great. This is the best day of our lives.         
	The baby news has also prompted a debate on whether fatherhood will impact on the 27-year-olds ability to win more Grand Slams. All could become clear at this seasons US Open, which starts in New York at the end of next month. Federer has won the last five titles on the concrete; can he win a sixth consecutive US Open now that he has become a dad?         
	Perhaps changing nappies, and everything else that fatherhood entails, will make the world No. 1 a better tennis player. There could be many more Slams to come from Daddy Roger.         
	I think fatherhood will have a really positive effect on Roger, Tim Henman, a friend of Federer, told this newspaper. Fatherhood will give Roger something else to think about, and give him a new perspective on his tennis as well. Its hugely important what Roger does on the court. But, knowing Roger as well as I do, and how important his family are to him, the extension of that family will have a really positive effect on him.         
	Professional tennis players tend to lead selfish lives. Becoming a parent can change that. Henman recalled how the birth of his first child, Rosie, made him think that he was no longer just playing for himself.         
	The impending arrival of Boris Beckers first child, his son Noah, helped the former Wimbledon champion to come off sleeping pills when he was on the tour. After becoming a father, Becker won the 1996 Australian Open.         
	Jimmy Connors won three of his eight Slams after becoming a dad. Andre Agassi, Becker and Yevgeny Kafelnikov won a Slam each as fathers. In modern times, Pat Cash, Andres Gomez, Petr Korda and Albert Costa also won one major each as fathers.         
	Still, life is going to have to change for Federer, who is supposed to be playing in the Masters-level tournament in Montreal that starts in just over a fortnights time.         
	Parenthood will be one of the themes on this summers North American hard-court swing, which culminates at the US Open. Kim Clijsters, a former world No. 1 and a mother of one, is returning to the womens circuit this summer. It is hardly that surprising, given the physical changes that their bodies go through, that mothers havent been as successful as fathers at the Grand Slams. The last time that a mother won a Slam title was in 1980 when Australias Evonne Goolagong was the Wimbledon champion.

                                                   McCullum: 200 in ODIs possible 
                      
	Hamilton: New Zealand opener Brendon McCullum has picked West Indies skipper Chris Gayle, Indian opener Virender Sehwag and master blaster Sachin Tendulkar as players capable of scoring a double hundred in limited-overs cricket.         
	Gayle, Sehwag, Tendulkar are capable of scoring a double. There are plenty of guys around the world who dominate the attack as well. Im sure we will see that happen soon, said McCullum.         
	Once someone does score a double hundred in one-day cricket, then we will see many more people achieving it. It is something that everyone holds in such high regard that it almost seems unachievable at the moment.         
	Wickets are getting better, the boundaries are getting shorter and there are the powerplays as well, which make it a lot more possible. Sachin (163 retired hurt) was with a big chance to get a double hundred the other day, said McCullum.         
	The 27-year-old opener said Twenty20 cricket had changed the mindset of the players.         
	They will have to be exact in their plans. If we can get some momentum with the bat and put them under some pressure then theres no reason why we cant post a big score and possibly win, he said.         
	Will Tendulkars absence make any difference to New Zealand?         
	I am sure it does, but they still have Sehwag, Dhoni, Yuvraj and Raina. So they still have a pretty strong batting line-up. We saw how well Sachin played the other day. To know that he will not be in the side will be a lift for our bowlers, he said.

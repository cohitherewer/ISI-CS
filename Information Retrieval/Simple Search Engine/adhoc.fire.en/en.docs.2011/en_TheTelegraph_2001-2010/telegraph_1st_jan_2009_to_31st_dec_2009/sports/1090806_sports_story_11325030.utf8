                                                   State badminton meet postponed
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The junior state badminton championships, which were to have taken place from August 5-8 at Bardhaman, have been postponed due to unplayable court conditions.         
	Yesterday (Tuesday) when we reached the stadium, it was raining. The meet was to be held on two courts but due to the rain, the courts had been damaged. This morning (Wednesday) we tried to shift the meet but the other court we were looking at had insufficient lighting.         
	Thus we decided to postpone the championship to a later date, said West Bengal Badminton Association (WBBA) treasurer, Shekhar Biswas.         
	Around 50 participants who had their matches this morning have already left while others have been informed of the postponement.         
	The state team for the nationals is generally selected from this championship.

    - Technical body wants contracted players to play domestic cricket             OUR CORRESPONDENT                            
	Mumbai: The technical committee on Wednesday recommended to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) that it revert back to playing all Ranji Trophy knockout matches on a home and away basis.         
	Over the last two seasons the knockout rounds were held at neutral venues, a practice the Sunil Gavaskar-led panel wants to do away with.         
	Those present at the meeting, besides Gavaskar, included Chetan Chauhan, Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Sourav Ganguly.         
	The BCCI is also reviewing a new method to decide results of rain-affected matches at the domestic level.         
	The committee was on Wednesday given a presentation of the latest mathematical model by its creator N. Dandekar and agreed that the model deserved a serious look.         
	Its a triangle theory. It was a short, mathematical presentation, said a technical committee member.         
	It was an interesting discussion, though for only 10 minutes Its at a nascent stage. We need to understand its wherewithal. Its strengths are not clear, and there was no comparison with the Duckworth/Lewis or any other method, the member added.         
	The technical committee discussed the possibility of using Kookaburra balls at domestic cricket but a final decision might depend on the views of the Indian players.         
	We discussed using Kookaburra balls but we have to also speak to the Indian team if we have to go for a change because thats the ball in use for Tests and ODIs, BCCI president Shashank Manohar told The Telegraph.         
	It may be noted that the condition of the balls used in domestic cricket last season had come under scrutiny as they were of poor quality and had to be changed after being used for less than five overs.         
	The committee also said it wants all the contracted players to make themselves available for their respective states when they are not playing international cricket.         
	The following are the decisions at the technical committee meeting:         
	 Foreign players  Foreign players should not be permitted to play in domestic tournaments (except the IPL) from the 2009-10 season onwards.         
	 Guest players  Only three guest players should be permitted in a state squad, as per rules.         
	 Knockout matches  The Ranji Trophy knockout matches should be played on a home and away basis, as opposed to the neutral venue system, which was in place for the last two seasons. The wickets for the knockout games would be under the charge of the BCCIs pitch and grounds committee member from the zone in question.         
	 Contracted players  The committee was of the view that the board should talk to its contracted players and ensure that they represent their respective state sides when not playing for India.         
	 Ball-change and powerplays  The changing of the ball should be made mandatory after 34 overs in one-day games, and the power play rules that are in place for international cricket should be applied to the domestic circuit.         
	 Special committee  A special committee comprising Sunil Gavaskar, Chetan Chauhan, Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Sourav Ganguly should go through the pitch reports of the domestic match referees.         
	 Assessment of pitches  The committee approved the format for assessment of pitches for domestic tournaments.         
	 Quality of balls  The committee expressed concern over the quality of the SG Test balls being used in domestic tournaments.

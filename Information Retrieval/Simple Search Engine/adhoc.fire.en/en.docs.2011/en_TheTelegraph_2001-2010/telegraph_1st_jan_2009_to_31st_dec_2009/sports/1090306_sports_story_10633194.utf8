                                                   New coach to assess paddlers 
                      
	New Delhi: Before devising a strategy for the 2010 Commonwealth Games, new national table tennis coach Massimo Constantini wants to asses the countrys paddlers during the upcoming Pro Tour Indian Open in Indore.         
	The Italian, who played for his country between 70s and 80s and has also worked as a high-performance coach and coach education course conductor of the International Table Tennis Federation, has been handed responsibility of grooming 40 core probables selected for the 2010 Games.         
	I think, initially it is very important for me to know players of the country deeply, only then you can understand the situation and its requirements. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mumbai Indians are almost out of race
                                                     Mumbai Indians are almost out of race
          
	Port Elizabeth: Matthew Hayden hit 60 not out to lead the Chennai Super Kings to a seven-wicket victory over the Mumbai Indians in their Indian Premier League match on Saturday.         
	After a slow start, in which he hit his first boundary in the 13th over, Hayden timed things superbly in the later stages, hitting four boundaries and a six in 57 balls.         
	His unbeaten fourth wicket stand with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (23 off 22 balls) guided the Chennai side to 151 for three after the Mumbai Indians had made 147 for five.         
	The result bolstered the Super Kings chances of a semi-final berth while for the Mumbai Indians, who are struggling at the bottom half of the points table with 11 points from 13 matches, semi-final dreams are almost over.         
	The Super Kings got off to a bad start as opener Parthiv Patel was trapped leg before by Lasith Malinga with the first ball of the innings.         
	 Suresh Raina hit a brisk 20 before lofting an effort off Dwayne Bravo for the bowler to take a difficult catch running to square-leg.         
	Hayden and Subramaniam Badrinath (22 off 23 balls) then added 40 runs for the third wicket.         
	Earlier JP Duminy had built up the Mumbai Indians innings, top-scoring with 62 runs. Duminys third wicket stand of 65 with Abhishek Nayar (33 off 27 balls) assured the Mumbai side of a competitive total.         
	Duminy held the innings together until the final over, hitting four boundaries and two sixes in 54 balls at the St. Georges Park.         
	The Super Kings attack was led by Albie Morkel who returned figures of one for 31 in four overs.

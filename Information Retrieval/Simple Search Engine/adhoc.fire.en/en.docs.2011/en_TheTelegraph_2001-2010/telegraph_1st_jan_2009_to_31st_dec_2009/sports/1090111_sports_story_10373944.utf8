	London: Aston Villa climbed to third in the Premier League on Saturday when a terrible error by their former goalkeeper Scott Carson earned them a 2-1 home victory over bottom-placed West Bromwich Albion.         
	Arsenal kept in touch with the top four as Nicklas Bendtners late goal secured a 1-0 home win over Bolton Wanderers. The Gunners remain fifth, level on 38 points with champions Manchester United who host Chelsea on Sunday.         
	Villa have 41 points from 21 games. In-form Everton have 35 points in sixth place after a 2-0 home victory over faltering Hull City.         
	Newcastle United drew 2-2 at home to West Ham United while Middlesbrough and Sunderland shared a 1-1 draw at the Riverside Stadium  Brazilian Afonso Alves scoring his first league goal for Boro since October.         
	Two matches fell victim to the icy weather conditions, with Portsmouths home game against Manchester City and Fulham vs Blackburn Rovers postponed because of frozen pitches.         
	Villa, who were last champions of England in 1981, are showing no signs of fading.         
	Martin Neils side with an English core are beginning to look like serious candidates to break the traditional top-four hierarchy.         
	They were not at their best against West Brom but still had the points in the bag by halftime at a freezing Villa Park. Curtis Davies, a former West Brom defender, headed the opener after 18 minutes from a Gareth Barry cross and Villa doubled their lead just before halftime.         
	There seemed little danger as Gabriel Agbonlahor shot low from an acute angle but Carson, who had a stint at Villa while on loan from Liverpool, got in a complete tangle and ended up parrying the ball into the net.         
	West Brom were back in the game four minutes into the second half when James Morrison beat Villa keeper Brad Friedel with a deflected shot.         
	The visitors launched a late onslaught on the Villa goal and had a penalty appeal waved away after a goalmouth scramble.         
	Substitute Nicklas Bendtner scored with just six minutes left Saturday to stop Arsenal falling even further behind in the race for a Champions League spot.         
	Arsenals lack of width and penetration, combined with the visitors resilience, meant the Gunners had looked set for another frustrating day in the Premier League with nothing more than a handful of half chances until the visitors tired in the last 25 minutes.

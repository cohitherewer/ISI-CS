                                                     Chance for youngsters to prove their mettle
                  Virender Sehwag on Wednesday                     
	Nagpur: The five-day Irani Cup tie between 38-time Ranji Trophy champions Mumbai and the Rest of India, starting Thursday, offers the youngsters in both teams the ideal chance to showcase their mettle.         
	The opening five-day match of the domestic season also provides Rest skipper Virender Sehwag, out of action since May because of a shoulder injury, a platform to ease back into the big-time cricket.         
	For Mumbai captain and opener Wasim Jaffer and middle order batsman Rohit Sharma, both India discards, the tie is yet another opportunity to remind the national selectors of their abilities.         
	Munaf Patel and S Sreesanth are two other pacers who would be eager to catch the selectors eyes and get back into the Indian team by spearheading the Rest pace bowling.         
	With Sehwag at the top of the order but without much match practice, Rest seem to hold an edge in their well-balanced attack that will be without Irfan Pathan who is out with an injury and has been replaced by UP youngster Bhuvneshwar Kumar.         
	Teams         
	Rest of India (from): Virender Sehwag (capt), M Vijay, S Badrinath (vice-capt), Manoj Tiwary, Ravindra Jadeja, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Sreesanth, Munaf Patel, Pragyan Ojha, Kedar Jadav, Abhinav Mukund, Uday Kaul and Sudeep Tyagi.         
	Mumbai (from): Wasim Jaffer (capt), Ajit Agarkar (vice-capt), Sahil Kukreja, Ajinkya Rahane, Rohit Sharma, Prashant Naik, Vinayak Samant (wk), Ramesh Powar, Iqbal Abdulla, Dhaval Kulkarni, Rahil Shaikh, Murtuza Hussain, Sushant Marathe, Saurabh Netravalkar and Onkar Khanvilkar.

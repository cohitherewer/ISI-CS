The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhutia turns up the heat
                                                   Bhutia turns up the heat
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutia has turned up the heat on Mohun Bagan. The India captain  locked in a bitter tussle with the green and maroon brigade for nearly four months now  brought defamation charges against his former club and claimed Rs 1 crore compensation at his meeting with Amarendra Sharan, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) appointed arbitrator, in New Delhi.         
	Bhaichungs legal counsel Usha Nath Banerjee said: The India skipper is a big name and Bagans false charges have brought him into disrepute. There are other issues like the transfer impasse and false statements against Bhaichung in the media.         
	The AIFF appeals committee member Utpal Majumder said the arbitrator had the authority to penalise Bagan if he thought Bhaichung was right. But then Bagan too have the right to make a counter claim and ask for damages.         
	Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra said he was yet to receive the letter and so could not comment on its content.

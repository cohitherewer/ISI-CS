                                                     Moles: India world No. 1
  - In Gambhir and Sehwag, they have two of the most explosive players in cricket       A CORRESPONDENT            Sehwag amp; Gambhir                                 
	Christchurch: New Zealand coach Andy Moles feels Mahendra Singh Dhonis team are No. 1 in the world at the moment given their consistent performance over a period of time.         
	Moles said it would be a big test for New Zealand against an Indian side that are playing very good cricket lately.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On the Indian team         
	I think in all facets, they are the No. 1 team in the world. You look at the way they have played over the last 18 months, they have gone round the world and at home and they have played very good cricket. They have got some very experienced players They are obviously coached really well. They are coming at a time when it will be a really good test for us. It is really exciting for New Zealand cricket.         
	The ODI series against Australia         
	Having gone 2-0 up in Australia, the feeling in the camp was really good. I think we probably just stood back a little bit and waited for the Australians to give us opportunities to win the game. Against the Indians we need to make sure we are at our best in all components of our game.         
	On Indias dismal tour last time         
	Certainly, in the past, the Indian teams havent toured too well. But I think they have put a lot of that to bed over the last couple of years. They did really well in Australia last year. From our point of view, we are really proud to play at home. I am really looking forward to putting the Indians under pressure whenever we can and hope to expose the weaknesses they have.         
	On the chinks in Indias armour         
	If we can get the ball to bounce a little bit  they are coming here from Sri Lanka, the wickets there and in India as well can be a little low. So we need to bowl well with the new ball. But having said that, in Gambhir and Sehwag, they have two of the most explosive players in cricket. They are an excellent cricket team.         
	What the NZ players need to do         
	The IPL has been an opportunity for our senior players especially to play alongside and see these Indian players. Thats got to be an advantage for us. Daniel Vettori, Oram, McCullum  those senior guys need to step up and they are aware of that.         
	The availability of Jacob Oram         
	He will be bowling very soon. Oram is one of the top all-rounders in the world and especially in the shorter form of the game, he is one of those explosive players who can win games. Any New Zealand team that have Oram playing, have the capacity to win games. Not only when you are playing well but also when you are behind, you can catch up with his immense hitting. We are hoping that come the ODIs, he will be bowling. He is bowling at the nets, we are very wary of pushing him too early.         
	What New Zealands plans are against India         
	We have got a meeting tonight (Monday) which will probably run for a couple of hours, go through all the stuff that has been compiled about the Indians playing over the last couple of series. Obviously, we have got John Wright in our camp who has a lot of experience about the Indian team. But of course, it is all right to know what you want to do, but you got to put it into practice. That is what we are going to be looking at over the next couple of days  to make sure that we carry out the plans that we are going to come up with.         
	The composition of the New Zealand team         
	We have got quite a few new faces that the Indians wouldnt have seen. (Martin) Guptill did really well in Australia, as did (Grant) Elliott. (Neil) Broom is coming on as well and improving with each game. It will be nice if we can catch the Indians out because they dont know too much about some of our younger players coming through but again, we have to execute our plans and make sure we play good cricket.

	Islamabad: The continued absence of Pakistan players from the Indian Premier League (IPL) will undermine the quality of the competition and affect viewership, players and officials said Wednesday while the Pakistan minister for sports, Aftab Shah Jillani, railed at the flimsy grounds for exclusion of his countrys cricketers.         
	The absence of our cricketers will not be good for cricket or the IPL, Shahid Afridi told an english daily.         
	Pakistan cricketers will miss out on the T20 league for the second year in a row after they failed to obtain visas.         
	It would have been good to make our IPL comeback next year but it is now clear that we wont be able to do that We cant do anything about it, Afridi said. (AGENCIES)

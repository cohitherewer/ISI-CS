The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fans keep away from   Tigers   event
                                                                                                                       7                                      Fans keep away from   Tigers   event
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                                              Tiger woods      
	The scandal engulfing Tiger Woods hit home on both coasts of the US as spectators stayed away in the world No 1s absence from his own tournament in California, while Jesper Parnevik maintained his criticism in Florida.         
	Woods has endured a torrid week publicly, which began when he crashed his car outside his Orlando home and needed hospital treatment for facial lacerations.         
	The winner of 14 majors apologised on his website five days later for transgressions and personal sins and failings, the same day that an American tabloid newspaper published allegations of an affair between the married father-of-two and a Los Angeles cocktail waitress.         
	Two days earlier, citing injuries sustained in the one-car accident, the 33 year-old withdrew from the Chevron World Challenge event which started at Sherwood Country Club near Los Angeles Friday.         
	Tournament officials announced that advance ticket holders had the option to claim a refund.         
	Attendance figures reportedly showed the offer being taken up in considerable numbers, as crowds fell on the opening day for the second year in a row.         
	When Woods won at Sherwood in 2007, 11,953 people attended the first round, but with the world No. 1 missing after knee surgery in 2008, just 6,974 were present on the opening day of the 72-hole event.         
	This year that figure was down to 6,893 fans as Britains Ian Poulter and Zach Johnson took a share of the first-round lead.         
	The pair shot four-under-par rounds of 68 to finish one stroke ahead of Padraig Harrington, with Open champion Stewart Cink, US PGA champion Y.E. Yang and Jim Furyk a further shot adrift.         
	In Florida, meanwhile, Parnevik stood by his criticism of Woods.         
	The former European Ryder Cup star and his wife introduced their fellow Swede, Elin Nordegren, to her future husband, and the 44-year-old had spoken out against Woods at the PGA Tour qualifying school in West Palm Beach.         
	He added: I havent really talked to Tiger yet so I dont want to say too much but my heart goes out to her.         
	Theres nothing I regret [saying] and I stand by everything. Hes lost all my respect.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Renault suspended from next F1 race
                                                   Renault suspended from next F1 race
                      
	Budapest: Renault was suspended from the upcoming European Grand Prix for allowing Fernando Alonso to leave the pit lane with his tyre not securely fastened to his car during Sundays Hungarian Grand Prix.         
	After reviewing film and radio recordings the FIA said that the French team was suspended from the next event in the Formula One championship after it failed to advise Alonso that a wheel nut on his front right tyre was not properly secured.         
	Alonsos right front tyre popped off as he rounded turn No.9, thirteen laps into a race he started from pole, and proceeded to bounce wildly down the track.         
	Renault formally appealed the penalty on Sunday. It now has 48 hours to lodge the appeal and eight days to present the grounds of appeal.           (AP)

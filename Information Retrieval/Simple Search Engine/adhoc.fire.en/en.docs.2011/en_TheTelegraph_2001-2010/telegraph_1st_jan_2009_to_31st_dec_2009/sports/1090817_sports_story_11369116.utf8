The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ODI career revived by IPL: Mishra
                                                   ODI career revived by IPL: Mishra
                      
	New Delhi: Leg-spinner Amit Mishra reckons it was his success in the second Indian Premier League (IPL) in South Africa which resuscitated his ODI career.         
	The chubby spinner has been struggling to shed the Test specialists tag with his success in Twenty20. The reward finally came with the selectors Sunday picking him for next months tri-series in Sri Lanka and the subsequent Champions Trophy, and Mishra said he owes his comeback to the IPL.         
	The selection in the ODI team is a reward for the hard work I have put in over the last few years. I am really very happy because at last my struggle has paid off. It came late but it eventually came. I have no hard feelings against anyone, an elated Mishra said.         
	Obviously, my performance in the IPL in South Africa, besides the recent Emerging Players tournament in Australia, has prompted the selectors to include me in the team and I promise I will live up to their faith if I get a chance, Mishra remarked.         
	Mishra took 14 wickets from 11 matches in the leagues second edition in South Africa.         
	In the Emerging Players tournament, Mishra took 11 wickets from six outings as India went on to win the title.         
	The diminutive spinner, who replaced left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha in the squad for the September 8-14 tri-series in Sri Lanka and the September 22-October 5 Champions Trophy, said the experience of bowling in the South African pitches would come handy in the Champions Trophy.         
	I bowled well in South Africa in conditions that are more suitable for fast bowlers. I think the selectors have picked me, keeping that in mind, he said.

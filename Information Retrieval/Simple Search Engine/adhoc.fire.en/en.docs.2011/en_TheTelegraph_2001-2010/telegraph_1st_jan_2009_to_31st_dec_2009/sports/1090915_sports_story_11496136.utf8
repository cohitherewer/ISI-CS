The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Douanes stranded in city
                                                   Douanes stranded in city
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Senegals AS Douanes, who were the only outstation participant in the recently concluded IFA Shield, are stranded in the city since September 5, the day they played their last group league match .         
	The Senegalese teamhad wanted to return to their country immediately after their last match. But they were in a fix as their contract with the Indian agent required them to participate in two more tournaments  the Bordoloi Trophy in Assam and the Governors Gold Cup in Sikkim.         
	It was learnt that the Senegal teams reluctance to play in the two meets was because they didnt bring boots with bigger studs.         
	As the agent refused to bear their cost of living citing the breach of contract, Douanes had approached the Indian Football Association to bail them out. But the IFA promptly refused saying it was not possible. The club then sought Fifa intervention.         
	Fifa, after looking into the matter, requested the All India Football Federation and the IFA to help the teams return to Senegal.         
	IFA secretary Utpal Ganguli agreed that he did receive a request from Fifa. Im personally looking into the matter and hope that their tickets will be arranged within the next two days, Ganguli said.

	Nagpur: Vinod Kambli Saturday came face-to-face with Sachin Tendulkar barely five days after the southpaws reported remarks against his childhood friend created a controversy.         
	Tendulkar and Kambli were attending a felicitation programme where their coach Ramakant Achrekar was also honoured. At the event named Gaurav Guru Shishyancha (in honour of the coach and his pupil), the two childhood friends were seated on either side of Achrekar and were seen talking to each other.         
	Tendulkar appeared to play down the incident when reporters sought his views. I have said whatever I wanted to (to Kambli) I am not going to say anything now, he said. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Serena seals berth in semi-finals
                                                     Serena seals berth in semi-finals
  - WTA championships Wozniacki conquers pain, Zvonareva             Serena Williams, who is assured of ending the year as No. 1, in action in Doha                           
	Doha: Serena Williams has clinched a spot in the semi-finals of the WTA Tour Championships after beating Elena Dementieva 6-2, 6-4 for her third straight win in the group phase.         
	Williams was broken to trail 2-1 in the first set but then won seven straight games to take control of the match.         
	She converted her third match point when Dementieva sent the ball into the net.         
	Serena Williams has already secured the year-end No. 1 ranking after Dinara Safina pulled out with a back injury on Wednesday.         
	Meanwhile, teenager Caroline Wozniacki fought through the pain barrier to move to the brink of the semi-finals on Thursday with a dramatic 6-0, 6-7, 6-4 defeat of late stand-in Vera Zvonareva.         
	The 19-year-old finished the match in agony as she was struck with cramp in her left thigh while Russian Zvonareva, who replaced the injured Safina in White Group, suffered a nose bleed in the middle of the second set.         
	Wozniacki, who spent a minute short of three hours beating Victoria Azarenka in her opening match on Wednesday, appeared to be heading for an easy victory when she capitalised on a slow start by world No. 9 Zvonareva, last years runner-up.         
	However, after squandering a 5-2 lead in the second set she became embroiled in a brutal baseline scrap that had both players gasping for air on another stifling night in the Qatari capital.         
	She could have finished it at 6-5 when she had two match points but Zvonareva hung on and edged a tiebreaker to set up a deciding set after a 10-minute heat break.         
	Wozniacki needed a thigh massage after moving 3-1 ahead in the third with a sensational pick-up of a Zvonareva drop shot and by the end the bandage around her left leg were in tatters as the rallies grew longer and more tortuous.         
	After breaking serve to lead 5-4, Wozniacki was pole-axed by cramp at 30-30, screaming in agony and writhing on the purple concrete.         
	Somehow she picked herself up to forge a third matchpoint and this time Zvonareva netted a weak forehand after two hours 48 minutes of absorbing action.         
	A tearful Wozniacki, who still has one more group match against Jelena Jankovic on Friday, could hardly walk to the net to shake her opponents hand.         
	After her controversial withdrawal from a tournament in Luxembourg last week, the US Open runner-up has already spent nearly six hours on court here.           (AGENCIES)

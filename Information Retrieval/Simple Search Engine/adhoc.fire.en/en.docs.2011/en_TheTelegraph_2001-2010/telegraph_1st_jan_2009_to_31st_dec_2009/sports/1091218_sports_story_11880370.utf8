The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Steady start for England 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Steady start for England 
                  Andrew Strauss on Thursday                     
	Centurion: Captain Andrew Strauss defied a lively South African attack to steer England to 88 for one at stumps on the Day II of the first Test Thursday.         
	South Africa made 418 in their first innings and claimed an early wicket when Friedel de Wet had Alastair Cook caught behind for 15 but the hosts failed to make another breakthrough.         
	Strauss reached the close on 44 not out with Jonathan Trott on 18 after South Africas last five wickets had added 138 runs and England off-spinner Graeme Swann completed his third five-wicket haul in Tests.         
	The hosts resumed in the morning on 262 for four and England removed Jacques Kallis for 120 and JP Duminy for 56, both caught in the slips by Paul Collingwood, to reduce South Africa to 330 for six at lunch.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Weakened Bagan face upbeat JCT
                                                     Weakened Bagan face upbeat JCT
            A STAFF REPORTER            Karim Bencharifa                           
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan, this season, have been caught offside, both on and off the field, in most of their ventures.         
	A bitter row with Bhaichung Bhutia  with the AIFF-appointed arbitrator ultimately giving interim relief to the India striker, finishing second-best in both the tournaments they have played so far and, more recently, their Moroccan coach getting entangled in a scuffle with a scribe, is a short summary of their tale of woes this season.         
	Add to that the loss in their I-League opener against Chirag United Monday last and its easy to understand why the green and maroon brigade could be a bit jittery when they face JCT in their second I-League match at the Salt Lake Stadium Thursday.         
	That JCT came out with flying colours in their first match, trouncing debutants Lajong FC 5-1, will make last editions runners-up even more cautious.         
	And completing the sorry picture will be the absence of two key men  striker Jose Ramirez Barreto and defender Surkumar Singh  from their line-up.         
	Baretto, who is nursing an injury, will be sorely missed as Edeh Chidi, Bagans other foreign import upfront, is yet to hit form. Homebred Branco Cardozo is all set to partner Chidi against JCT.         
	Surkumar, whose red card the other day in the match against Chirag rules him out Thursday, not only is a trusted sentinel in defence but is also quite effective with his overlapping runs.         
	Zenith Genius may fill in for the Manipuri on the morrow but it remains to be seen how the youngster fits into Bagans plans.         
	A buoyant JCT looked vibrant at practice Thursday. Baljit Singh Sahni, who netted a hattrick against Lajong, and Balwant Singh will be their main goal-scoring options. Nigerian midfielder Penn Orji is their only foreign import.         
	Sukhwinder Singh, the JCT coach said: Bagan are a good side and, even in the absence Barreto, they are a formidable opposition. We respect them as a team. They are acquainted with the artificial turf and it will be an advantage for them, since we havent played on this surface before.

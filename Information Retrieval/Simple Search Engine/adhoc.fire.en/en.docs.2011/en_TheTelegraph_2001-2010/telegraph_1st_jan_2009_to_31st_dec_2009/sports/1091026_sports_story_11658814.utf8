                                                     Bhowmick: I should quit
            A STAFF REPORTER            Subhas Bhowmick                           
	Calcutta: It seemed Subhas Bhowmick had been hit by a tsunami. As if losing a derby wasnt enough, his team, East Bengal, had conceded five goals against Mohun Bagan. And, after keeping the media waiting for more than an hour on Sunday, at the Salt Lake Stadium, when Bhowmick turned up all he could mumble was Its a big setback. I should quit.         
	East Bengal sources said the club wont sack Bhowmick. But then if he puts in his papers we will definitely accept that, club sources said late on Sunday.         
	How things change, isnt it? Just some months back Bhomwick was going bang-bang, firing studs like the Subrata Pauls and the Sunil Chetris and hiring duds like Sebastian Omar and Jan Berger.         
	As the season has progressed, slowly it has dawned on the East Bengal officials that everything has gone horribly wrong  Rs 1 crore already down the drain. Out went Patrick Bergers cousin, the Argentine Omar was shown the door and Brazilian Edmilson was released on disciplinary grounds.         
	There was hardly anything to write home about with the seasons first victory coming after seven matches and that too against Eastern Railway in the CFL the other day.         
	Now this ignominious defeat. It seems it is the end of the road for the coach who once upon a time won the Asean Cup with the red and gold brigade.         
	We made silly mistakes and were punished for that, his voice was barely audible at the news conference. There was a flash of that never-say-die spirit though when someone asked him whether this was the saddest day of his life. I have seen enough tragedy, he said.         
	If Bhowmick was mumbling, his Bagan counterpart Karim Bencharifa was at his modest best. First and foremost we got three points. Then comes the five goals. I am happy that this result has given our millions of fans so much joy. I dont know much about the significance of these goals but, yes, I am happy that the fans are happy, Bencharifa said.         
	The Moroccan, whose name will be immortalised in Bagan fo-lklore, said he never doubted Edeh Chidis talent. Oh, he was just superb today. I always knew he would score. He was getting into the right place at the right time. Today he just converted those chances.         
	Bencharifa said Jose Ramirez Barreto, who had to be substituted after injuring his hamstring on the right leg, will not be travelling to Shillong where Lajong are waiting to play the host on Thursday. That is in the I-League. He played a superb match but he got very emotional after picking up the injury, he said.         
	Bencharifa said that his team was a transformed lot after the change of ends. We let in three soft goals. But in the second half we were very good.         
	Salgaocar win         
	In Margao, Ekene M Ikenwas twin strikes helped Salgaocar beat Sporting Clube de Goa 3-2. Salgaocar scored through Beevan DMello (12th), and Ikenwa (22nd, 30th), while Nathaniel Amos (10th) and Joseph Pereira (51st) reduced the margin for Sporting.

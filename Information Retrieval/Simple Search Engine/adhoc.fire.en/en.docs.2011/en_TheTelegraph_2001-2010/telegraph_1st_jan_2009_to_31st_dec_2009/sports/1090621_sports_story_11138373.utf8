The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Italy need to win against Brazil today
                                                   Italy need to win against Brazil today
                      
	Centurion: Struggling Italy meet an upbeat Brazil on Sunday in a decisive Group B match that could send the losers home from the Confederations Cup.         
	Italy need a victory by two goals to secure a spot in the semi-finals without depending on the match between the United States and Egypt, while a draw will be enough for the Brazilians.         
	Italy are coming off a disappointing 1-0 loss to Egypt. Brazil appear to be hitting their stride after a dominating 3-0 win over the United States.         
	The match at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria is one of the most anticipated in the eight-team competition in South Africa, pitting two title favourites against each other. European champion Spain are the other top contenders in the tournament.         
	Its a world classic and every player likes to be part of a match like this, Brazil striker Robinho said. We respect the quality of the Italian players, but we are motivated to win.         
	The Brazilians wouldnt mind sending their rivals home earlier than expected.         
	It would be good if we can eliminate Italy now, Kaka said. They didnt have a good start in the 2006 World Cup either but ended winning the competition. You cant underestimate them.         
	Brazil have six points, three more than Italy and Egypt. The United States are yet to earn a point and are virtually eliminated.

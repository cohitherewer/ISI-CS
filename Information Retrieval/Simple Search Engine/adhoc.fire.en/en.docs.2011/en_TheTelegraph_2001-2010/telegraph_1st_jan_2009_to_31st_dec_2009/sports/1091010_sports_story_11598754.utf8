                                                   Dalmiya: No question of a personal victory
    - December 20 likely date for SL match, Edens 1st ODI since February 07           A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Jagmohan Dalmiya doesnt see the return of international cricket to Eden Gardens as a personal victory.         
	We believe the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is a family. In a family, you make a noise when justice is not done. Thats all. Theres no question of a personal victory or loss, said the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president after the BCCI awarded Eden Gardens an ODI after more than two years, on Friday.         
	The Eden has been off the international calendar for a long time now, and many believed it was partly because of Dalmiyas bitter relationship with the powers that be in the BCCI.         
	Therefore, the allotment of the fourth ODI between India and Sri Lanka (likely to be held on December 20), has been a big relief for the cricket lovers of Bengal.         
	The Eden last hosted an ODI against Sri Lanka in February 2007 during Prasun Mukherjees regime, but the match was abandoned because of rain.         
	Cuttack, Rajkot, Visakhapatnam and Delhi will host the other four ODIs, BCCIs tour, programme and fixtures committee said.         
	The three Tests against Sri Lanka will be played in Mumbai, Kanpur and Ahmedabad, with Mohali and Nagpur hosting the two Twenty20 matches. The dates will be announced later.         
	Quizzed on his current relation with the BCCI, the former president asked: Ive been the secretary of this Board, been the president of this Board, and this Board has sent me to the International Cricket Council. Can the relation be anything other than good?         
	Dalmiya added: We deserved to hold an ODI. We deserve a Test also, but at the moment we are happy to have got the one-dayer. Justice has been done.         
	Eden Gardens had missed out when the venues for the India versus Australia ODI series was announced in July. It was learnt then itself that the Eden would get an ODI against Sri Lanka, as per the new rotation policy adopted by the BCCI with effect from June 2007.         
	Dalmiya, however, said the CAB felt an ODI was already due. Weve been communicating regularly with the BCCI, trying to convince them that the Eden has been deprived.         
	This allotment is the result of our letter to the BCCI secretary on October 5, explaining how a match is due according to the existing rotation policy, he said.         
	Dalmiya added that the CAB thinks the rotation policy needs to be reviewed.         
	Were happy that weve got an ODI at last but well be happier if the rotation policy is reviewed. Im told some other members have also expressed the same view in today (Friday)s meeting, the president said.         
	He said Edens ongoing renovation was a worry but everything would be done in a professional manner.         
	THE VENUES         
	Tests: Mumbai, Kanpur, Ahmedabad         
	ODIs: Cuttack, Rajkot, Visakhapatnam, Calcutta, Delhi

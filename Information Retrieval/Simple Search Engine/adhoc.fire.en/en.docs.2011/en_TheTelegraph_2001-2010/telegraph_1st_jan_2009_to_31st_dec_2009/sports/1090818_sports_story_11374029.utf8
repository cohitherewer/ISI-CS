The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murray masters Montreal meet
                                                   Murray masters Montreal meet
                      
	Montreal: Briton Andy Murray overcame sweltering heat to beat Argentine Juan Martin del Potro 6-7, 7-6, 6-1 in the Montreal Masters final on Sunday.         
	A day after replacing Rafael Nadal as world No. 2, Murray delivered a gritty performance to wear down the towering Argentine in two hours, 42 minutes under a broiling sun.         
	It was Murrays fifth win of the season and he became the first Briton in 128 years to lift the Canadian title.         
	The victory completed a perfect start to the North American hardcourt season for the 22-year-old Scotsman, who was returning to action after his semi-final loss to Andy Roddick at Wimbledon.         
	I love winning tournaments and every player will tell you the same thing but I have never been to No.2 in the world before, Murray told reporters. Its something Ive never done, thats new to me.         
	Ive won a couple of Masters events and it still feels great but being (No.2) maybe means a little bit more than winning a tournament this week. (AP)

  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL
   Were capable of beating India, says the Bangladesh captain         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ashraful                                 
	Nottingham: Bangladeshs cricket captain for the past two years, 24-year-old Mohammed Ashraful (the youngest Test centurion, by the way), spoke to The Telegraph at the Park Plaza on Thursday afternoon.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q What are your thoughts in the lead-up to the World T20?         
	A Look, we have nothing to lose... In my view, all teams face the heat in T20 and no one side can be labelled as the team most favoured to win a tournament... Our goal, for now, is to make the Super Eight... That stage has to be achieved first.         
	You run into India in your first match (Trent Bridge, on Saturday)...         
	Aamra to jani Indian team bhalo... The Indians have been very consistent over the past 18 months or so... Im confident well do well, even though we didnt win the warm-up matches against the big teams  Australia, Sri Lanka and New Zealand... Actually, almost all were close and couldve gone our way had we not made small mistakes which cost us heavily.         
	Are you hoping to upset India, repeat what happened in the 2007 (50 overs) World Cup?         
	I dont like the word upset... Weve been playing good cricket for the past year or so and dont see ourselves as underdogs... Yes, were capable of beating India and if we do so, I wouldnt term it an upset... Of course, were aware that India won the last World T20.         
	Whats the biggest challenge for Bangladesh?         
	To do well in all three departments  batting, bowling and fielding  and to quickly learn from mistakes made in the warm-up matches.         
	In your opinion, who are the players who could make a difference for Bangladesh?         
	I expect big things from (all-rounder) Shakib Al Hasan... Tamim Iqbal should give us explosive starts... Fast bowler Rubel Hossain, who let go at over 90 mph in the last warm-up match, has the ability to raise the bar... There are others too.         
	As youre the captain, are you under a lot of pressure?         
	I wouldnt say so... Ive done pretty well in major tournaments and Im definitely not short on confidence... Plus Ive done well at Trent Bridge... I recall having got a 52-ball 94 against England in a NatWest match in 2005...         
	The Mumbai Indians played you in only one match in the recent IPL. Are you, then, more keen to make an impact in the World T20?         
	Zaheer Khans injury made the team management play an overseas bowler/all-rounder and that hurt my chances as theres a cap on the number of foreigners in the XI... I understood the team managements problem... If I do well in the World T20, then the Mumbai Indians could field me more often in 2010... Im on a two-year contract.         
	Mashrafe Mortaza also got to play one match, for the Kolkata Knight Riders         
	He shouldve been played more often... Whats the point of investing $600,000 on a player if youll give him only one match? Mashrafes franchise didnt treat him well and people in Bangladesh lost interest in the IPL because of how the tournament unfolded for us. They were upset. (After a pause) Mashrafe-r jonno kharap holo.         
	Being Mortazas national captain, what have you told him?         
	That he should stay positive... That everything in life doesnt happen the way you want it to... He may have been low on morale in South Africa, but is fine here... Hes fired up.         
	It has become bitterly cold. Is the weather then going to be a significant factor?         
	Teams from the subcontinent prefer the temperature to be on the warmer side... As professionals, well have to adapt, theres no choice.         
	The last one: Having played all three forms at the international level, besides the obvious, what sets T20 apart from the rest?         
	The pace... Its just too fast, with the batters looking to smash every ball... Indeed, T20 is very hard on the bowlers and one has to feel sorry for them. In the ODIs, the batters often look to build an innings, thats not so in T20.

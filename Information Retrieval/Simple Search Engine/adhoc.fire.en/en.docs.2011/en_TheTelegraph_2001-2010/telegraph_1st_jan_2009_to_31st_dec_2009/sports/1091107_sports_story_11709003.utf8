	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly was on Friday confirmed captain of the Kolkata Knight Riders for the third edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2010. Dav Whatmore was named coach.         
	That the former India captain would be back at the helm was reported by The Telegraph on July 26. Whatmores role was also reported on October 13.         
	Vijay Dahiya will be the assistant coach and Wasim Akram mentor. Andrew Leipus and Adrian le Roux have been appointed physiotherapist and team trainer, respectively.         
	Sourav will have an important role in the decision-making process and team selection for the next IPL season, according to a KKR release.         
	Souravs position as captain is not merely ceremonial; he will be the key driving force, helping to create and shape the cricket team ahead of the next season and will be responsible for all cricket related decisions with regard to the 2010 season, the release stated.         
	Sourav was also confident of putting up a good show. KKR is looking forward to an exciting and successful season ahead, with the new appointments and strategies in place. I am excited at the prospect of working with Dav and the entire team closely, in addition to playing at our home ground once again, Sourav remarked.         
	Talking about the choice of Whatmore as the coach, co-owner Jay Mehta said: Dav has the right vision not only for the team, but for each of the players, and for the franchise as a whole. He is very aware of our current position in the IPL and knows that there is only one way to go now  up.         
	Whatmore was the coach when Arjuna Ranatunga led Sri Lanka to victory at the 1996 World Cup. The Australian has also served as the director of cricket operations at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore.         
	I am optimistic about the season ahead, and have utmost faith in Sourav, the team, and KKR management, and look forward to a successful tournament. I will be working closely with the team to continue building KKR into a successful franchise, both on and off the field, remarked Dav after his new appointment.

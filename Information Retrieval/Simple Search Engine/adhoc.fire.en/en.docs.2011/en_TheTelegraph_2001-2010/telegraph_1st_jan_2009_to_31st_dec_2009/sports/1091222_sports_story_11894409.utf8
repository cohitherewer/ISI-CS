                                                                                                                       7                                      Gambhir still No.1 in Tests
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India opener Gautam Gambhir has retained his place at the top of the Reliance Mobile ICC Player Rankings for Test batsmen, followed by Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara of Sri Lanka, respectively.         
	South Africa captain Graeme Smith, meanwhile, has dropped out of top-10, according to the latest rankings released by the International Cricket Council Monday. Jacques Kallis has become South Africas highest-ranked batsman after replacing Smith in the top-10.         
	The 34-year-old, who scored 120 and four in the Centurion Test against England, has climbed three places to eighth in the rankings. It is the first time since August 2008 that Kallis has featured in the top-10. Smith, who scored a duck and 12 at Centurion, has slid four places to the 11th spot.         
	Smith is not the only batsman inside the top-20 to take a dive in the latest rankings. Australias Michael Clarke and Ricky Ponting, Englands Andrew Strauss and South Africas Ashwell Prince have suffered the same fate after disappointing performances with the bat at Centurion, and in Perth.         
	In bowlers rankings, South Africas left-arm spinner Paul Harris, and Englands Graeme Swann and Stuart Broad have achieved career-best rankings. The list is still headed by South Africas Dale Steyn, with Australias Mitchell Johnson second and Muttiah Muralidharan third.

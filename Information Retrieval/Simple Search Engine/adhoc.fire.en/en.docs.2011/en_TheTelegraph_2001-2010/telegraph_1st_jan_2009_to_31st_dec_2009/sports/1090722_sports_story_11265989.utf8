The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Apostrophe deserves another chance
                                                                                                               Apostrophe deserves another chance
            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: The second day of the monsoon season, on Wednesday, could be another day of long knives as nothing has changed. The race track is much the same  soft and slushy  because of rains during the week and, to add to punters woes, fields are pretty big in five of the six events on the cards.                   
	The feature event, the 1,400m Goldliner Cup has the least number of runners  just five to be precise  but each of them is capable of landing the trophy. However, trainer Arti Doctors Apostrophe gets the first call, simply because the last outing failed-favourite is going over a trip he relishes most. Apostrophes recent outing over a scurry, with a crushing impost of 61-1/2kg, albeit in a lower set, has indeed sharpened him up. Neeraj Rawal partners the five-year-old horse.          
	In the baby race, the 1,000m Zelda Cup, trainer Bharath Singhs ward, Countess, seems to be at an advantage in view of apprentice Shaikh Israils riding allowance. The filly is looking and working well.

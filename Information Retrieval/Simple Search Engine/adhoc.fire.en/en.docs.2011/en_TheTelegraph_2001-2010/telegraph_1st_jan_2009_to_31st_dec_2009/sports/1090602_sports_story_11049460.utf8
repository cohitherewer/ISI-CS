The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Paes, Dlouhy in semis; Bhupathi out
                                                   Paes, Dlouhy in semis; Bhupathi out
                      
	Paris: Leander Paes kept the Indian challenge alive by advancing to the mens doubles semi-finals with Czech Lukas Dlouhy on Monday but it was curtains for Mahesh Bhupathi and his partner Mark Knowles of Bahamas at the French Open.         
	Third seeds Paes and Dlouhy thwarted a late challenge from fifth seeds Bruno Soares of Brazil and Kevin Ullyett of Zimbabwe to emerge 6-2, 7-6 (7-5) victorious and enter the last-four stage.         
	The Indo-Czech pair face either top seeds Daniel Nestor of Canada and Nenad Zimonjic of Serbia or Russians Igor Kunitsyn and Dmitry Tursunov in the semi-finals.         
	Paes and Dlouhy dominated the opening set and broke their rivals twice before wrapping it up in just 36 minutes. However, they had to stave off a strong challenge from the fifth seeds in the second set that lasted 56 minutes.         
	However, Bhupathi and Knowles bowed out of the tournament with a pre-quarter-final loss to unseeded Jose Acasuso of Argentina and Fernando Gonzalez of Chile.

                                                   Sporting Clube de Goa move atop with 2-1 win
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Sporting Clube de Goa boosted their title chances by earning a 2-1 victory over Mumbai FC in a scrappy I-League affair at the Cooperage here Sunday.         
	Following Mohun Bagans 0-3 loss to East Bengal in the Calcutta derby, Sporting Clube again find themselves at the top of the I-League standings.         
	The Goan side now have 34 points from their 16 outings while Bagan have 33 points from the same number of matches.         
	The visitors were far from their best and, after Joseph Pereira put them in front early in the seventh minute, came nowhere near scoring a goal until a defending error by Mumbai FC gave them the crucial second goal in the 76th minute.         
	The hosts reduced the margin five minutes later through Alex Ambrose, who scored from the spot, but for the most part of the match lacked the intelligence that has been their hallmark in their debut season.         
	If anything, David Booths men seemed to have completely lost it when Selwyn Fernandes became the third player to be sent off in the 82nd minute.         
	Earlier, home defender James Dissiramah and visitors forward Obagbemiro Junior were issued red cards for coming to blows. Sporting Clube captain Wilton Gomes was also shown a yellow for getting entangled in the melee.         
	The loss of Dissiramah following the 73rd minute ruckus cost the hosts as Fernandes, usually sound at the back, tried to head away a floater from Mathew Gonsalvess free-kick but left it for goalkeeper Kalyan Chaubey at the last moment. Gomes made amends for his earlier disciplinary lapse by tapping the ball past the stranded Chaubey.         
	Mumbai FC received a fresh lease of life in the 81st minute when Gonsalves committed a foul on substitute Alex Ambrose inside the penalty area and the latter converted without any trouble.         
	But the very next minute, Fernandes punctured his teams hopes by planting his studs on Gomes and getting banished from the pitch.

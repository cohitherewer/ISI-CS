	Centurion: Yusuf Pathan struck a blistering half-century while Graeme Smith powered his way to a belligerent 42 to power the Rajasthan Royals to a five wicket victory over the Delhi DareDevils at the SuperSport Park here Tuesday.         
	Chasing a modest 144, the Rajasthan Royals rode Pathans 62 of 30 balls and Smiths sensible 42 off 46 balls to cruise to 147 for five in 18.3 overs. It was their second victory of the tournament and ended the DareDevils winning run.         
	Electing to bat, a fighting half-century from AB de Villiers and some lusty hitting down the order from Daniel Vettori and Mithun Manhas helped the Delhi DareDevils post 143 for seven after being reduced to 49 for four.         
	The Royals started their run chase on a cautious note and were little a unlucky when Rob Quiney (4) was adjudged leg before, though TV replays clearly showed he hit the ball.         
	Swapnil Asnodkar (11), demoted from the opening position, showed glimpses of his last years brilliance, picking up 10 runs off Pradeep Sangwans first over before running himself out in search of a non-existent single.         
	Next man in Paul Valthaty (1) didnt trouble the scorers. Graeme Smith, at the other end, played the role of a sheet anchor, but didnt get ample support from the other end.         
	The strategic timeout seemed to have worked in Delhis favour as Mishra struck twice after the break, first dismissing Jadeja caught in the deep by Sangwan and then stumped the Rajasthan Royals skipper Shane Warne.         
	But Pathan had other plans as hit two consecutive sixes and a four of Vettori to take 19 runs of the 13th over. As if that was not enough, neeeding 35 off 24 balls, Mishra gave away 18 runs in his last over.         
	Pathan was in a hurry to wrap up the proceedings and hit Nehra for consecutive sixes and fours to draw curtains on the match.         
	Earlier, De Villiers (50 off 40) and Vettori (29) ensured that Delhi put up a decent total, stitching together a crucial 56-run sixth-wicket.           (AGENCIES)

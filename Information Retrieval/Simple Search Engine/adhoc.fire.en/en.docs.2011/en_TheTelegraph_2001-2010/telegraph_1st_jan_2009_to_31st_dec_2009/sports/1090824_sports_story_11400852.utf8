	New Delhi: Bhaichung Bhutia made his 100th appearance for the country a memorable one as he led India to a 2-1 win over Kyrgyzstan in the ONGC Nehru Cup at the Ambedkar Stadium Sunday.         
	With this victory India now have three points from two matches and are back in the race for a place in the title round. With four of the five teams on three points, Kyrgyzstan, who are yet to log a point, are definitely out of the tournament.         
	Bhaichung is now the highest scorer for India with 42 from 100 matches. He surpassed IM Vijayan, who scored 41 in 86 matches.         
	Playing in front of a capacity crowd that lustily cheered the home team, Bhaichung came up with a classy display to put India in the lead in the 43rd minute and then earned a penalty that ensured a convincing win. The captain was rightly adjudged Man of the Match.         
	Kyrgyzstan goalkeeper Pavel Matiash brought Bhaichung down inside the box in the 57th minute and Sunil Chetri confidently slotted home from the resultant spot kick to make it 2-0.         
	But Bhaichung and Chetri were not the only heroes of the triumph in the must-win encounter. Goalkeeper Subrata Paul, who was rejected as no good by East Bengal last season, stopped a penalty kick in the 59th minute to deny Kyrgyzstan a chance of making a comeback.         
	It was stopper Gourmangi Singh brought down Almazbek Mirzaliev inside the box and Mirzaliev himself took the resultant penalty only for Paul to stop the ball with a quick dive to his left, much to the crowds delight.         
	Overall, India were the better team and could have won by a bigger margin. Kyrgyzstan did pull one back in the 89th minute through Mirlan Murzaev but it wasnt good enough. The hosts played the four minutes of time added on confidently and even launched two positive moves at the rival goalmouth.         
	Given Indias domination it was unfortunate that the hosts had to wait till the 43rd minute to take the lead. If Kyrgyzstan were hoping they would go into the half time on an even note, it was shattered by an opportunistic goal from Bhaichung.         
	The Kyrgyzstan defenders fumbled on a long clearance by Indian goalkeeper Paul. Bhaichung was quick to grab the ball and he than ran to the left edge of the six-yard box to flick the ball at the far post. The ball hit the post before rolling in.         
	The home team started on an aggressive note after the breather to tear open the Kyrgyzstan defence time and again. Steven Dias was the pick of the lot with his menacing runs down the right. In the first 30 minutes, the Mahindra midfielder created at least three chances but the strikers failed to capitalise.         
	Teams         
	India: Subrata Paul; Deepak Mondal, Anwar, Gourmangi Singh and Mahesh Gawli; Steven Dias, Climax Lawrence, NP Pradeep (Mehrajuddin, 87th) and Anthony Pereira (Renedy Singh, 69th); Sunil Chetri and Bhaichung Bhutia (Sushil Singh, 82nd).

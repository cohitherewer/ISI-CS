                                                     Shiv joins Greg on sidelines
            A STAFF REPORTER            Anthony Kang hits a tee shot at the Vines Country Club in Perth on Friday. (AFP)                           
	Calcutta: The miracle Shiv Kapur so desperately needed didnt occur and the Delhi pro joined Australian great Greg Norman and world No. 9 Camilo Villegas on the sidelines after his second round card of two-under 70 in the Johnnie Walker Classic, here on Friday.         
	Kapurs goose was cooked in the first round itself when he stuttered to six-over 78 and though he came up with a vastly improved show on Friday, his two-day total of four-over 148 was way down the cut line set at 141.         
	Playing his back nine first, Kapur was three-under at the turn and in fact approached the third hole at four-under before dropping three shots on the par-five hole. The youngster signed off with a birdie to eventually settle for a round of 70.         
	Kapur can draw some solace from the fact that neither Norman (146) nor Villegas (72) could make the cut either after both returned identical cards of 71.         
	Meanwhile, American Anthony Kang extended his rich vein of form to earn the joint halfway lead.         
	The Asian Tour regular fired a second successive five-under-par 67 to lead on 10-under-par 134, alongside Irishman Damien McGrane, who came in with a 68.         
	Japans Hiroyuki Fujita, New Zealands Danny Lee and Spaniard Ignacio Garrido were a stroke back after matching 68s in the 1.25 million event.         
	A birdie at the last hole for a 71 saw Mardan Mamat of Singapore stay within touching distance of the leaders on 136.         
	Kang continued his dream run to give himself a shot at the Johnnie Walker Classic. You know, Id be lying to you if I didnt think about winning two in a row. Weve got a pretty stellar field and for me to do that, I think if you look at it statistically, its against the odds, said Kang.         
	Fujita sank five birdies against a lone bogey to stay hot on the leaders heels. It was good to maintain my form after Thursdays good start. The greens are getting firmer and Im sure they will place some tight pins at the weekend which will make putting more difficult, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Difficult task under alien conditions 
                                                   Difficult task under alien conditions 
                      
	Wellington: India, with an unassailable lead in hand, will only have to guard against complacency and the seaming track of the Basin Reserve to notch their first Test win here in 34 years when they take on the hosts in the third and final match of the series here on Friday.         
	India have won Tests at Adelaide, Perth, Trinidad, The Oval, Multan, Galle, Johannesburg and Hamilton. But at the Basin Reserve, it would probably be their biggest challenge of scoring a win at a venue where their last triumph came in 1975.         
	The visitors, having established a 1-0 lead at Seddon Park, need to only draw the third and final Test here to achieve a historic series triumph, last accomplished by Mansur Ali Khan Pataudis team in 1967-68.         
	But their task wouldnt really be a stroll in the park as, unlike at Hamilton and and Napier, they will be tested on a sporting deck, which is expected to have a lot of carry and assist lateral movement off the seam as well.         
	If India can exorcise their fear against the moving ball, it would help them to raise their bar in international cricket as a team, which has won Test matches in all conditions and wickets, irrespective of it assisting pace, bounce, swing, seam and cut.         
	Somehow their inadequate skill or technique in combating the moving ball, has stuck out like a sore pimple on an otherwise good Test profile.         
	In fact, in 2002-03, India had conjured one of their worst performances in Test history when they were bowled out for below par scores of 161 and 121. But that was when the Black Caps prepared green tops to rattle them.         
	Today, the New Zealanders are wary of the Indian bowling attack. They have refrained from spicing up the deck with grass this time around.         
	Indias performance over the last 18 months have been the envy of every Test playing nation, a duration in which they have beaten the best in exacting situations.         
	If they reproduce the character and fortitude that they displayed in the second Test at Napier, when they overcame the odds of losing a Test by an innings and salvaged a draw, the Black Caps, who have strengthened their pace attack by calling in Tim Southee, should be ones squirming.         
	Indias formidable batting has kept them in good stead with Sachin Tendulkar topping the run aggregate with (273 in three innings), followed by Gautam Gambhir (255), V.V.S. Laxman (230) and Rahul Dravid (219).         
	The return of skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who missed the second Test with a sore back, and the refreshing form of Yuvraj Singh, who gathered his shattered confidence with a breezy 54 not out in the second innings at Napier, augments Indias batting reserves.         
	If Sehwag, who has been magnanimous in offering his wicket on a platter in both the Tests, can churn out a substantial score, the hosts can be in a spot of bother in one of their favourite hunting grounds.         
	If the Black Caps hope that the lively wicket would throw the Indian batsmen out of their rhythm, they would be making a huge mistake. Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma have the reputation of bowling out Ricky Pontings Aussies on flatter and drier wickets at home.

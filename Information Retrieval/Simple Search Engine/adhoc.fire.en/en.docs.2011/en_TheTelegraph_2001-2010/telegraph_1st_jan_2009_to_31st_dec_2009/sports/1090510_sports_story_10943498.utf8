	Kimberley: Subramaniam Badrinath smashed a brilliant unbeaten 59 and shared a crucial 89-run partnership with Matthew Hayden (48) to fashion the Chennai Super King impressive seven-wicket win over the Rajasthan Royals in their IPL match Saturday.         
	Chennai not only recorded their fifth victory in a row but also beat the defending champions for the second time to remain atop the points table.         
	Chasing 141 to win, Chennai overhauled the target with 10 balls to spare.         
	Earlier, a disciplined bowling attack had restricted the Royals to a modest 140 for seven. Badrinath supported Hayden well after losing two early wickets as the duo knit together 89-runs for the third wicket.         
	Hayden departed when he danced down to the wicket on one off rival skipper Shane Warne in the 17th but was foxed by the big turn and stumper Naman Ojha uprooted his stumps.         
	Chennai needed 15 runs from 19 balls at that stage but Badrinath held his nerve to steer Chennai to victory.         
	Earlier, Chennai bowlers used the slow track brilliantly as skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni shuffled them intelligently throughout the Rajasthan innings, ending at 140 for seven. Graeme Smith (30), Swapnil Asnodkar (26) and Ravinder Jadeja (27) were the main contributors for the defending champions.

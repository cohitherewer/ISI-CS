The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Symonds likely for   SA tour
                                                   Symonds likely for   SA tour
                            
	Melbourne: Controversial Australian allrounder Andrew Symonds is making swift recovery from a knee surgery and is likely to tour South Africa in February.         
	Symonds is scheduled to begin jogging this week after undergoing an operation on December 31 to clear loose fragments of cartilage from his right knee.         
	The 33-year-old could return within three weeks, which would make him available for game three of Australias one-day series with New Zealand which starts on February 8 in Sydney. Australia leave for South Africa on February 16.         
	Cricket Australia physiotherapist Alex Kountouris was pleased with Symonds recovery.         
	I would be disappointed if Andrew wasnt available to go to South Africa. Things are progressing well. Andrew has been taking it easy but I expect him to be doing some running this week and we will gradually build his recovery up over the coming weeks, Kountouris said.         
	At this stage, its hard to say when Andrew will be back but Id expect it to be somewhere between three to five weeks, he was quoted as saying by a newspaper.           (PTI)

            A STAFF REPORTER            New Bengal coach Roger Binny with CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya at the Eden on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Newly-appointed Bengal coach Roger Binny is not reading much into the tough group that Bengal have been slotted in for this years Ranji Trophy.         
	Yes, it is a tough group But it is too soon to think about such things. Lets see how it pans out It will be challenging and Im game for the challenge, Binny said on Thursday.         
	Bengal have been clubbed with Uttar Pradesh, Saurashtra, Karnakata, Maharashtra, Baroda and Delhi in group B of the Elite division. They will open their campaign against Maharashtra in Pune from November 3.         
	A member of Kapil Devs 1983 World Cup-winning team, Binny was in the city to chalk out plans with Dr Vece Paes  the man entrusted with the job of making the side fitter  and CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya.         
	I intend to be here in mid-August, meet the players and draw up the programme, said Binny.         
	He stressed on the fitness aspect of the players saying that fitness is of utmost importance and has to be at the highest level.         
	He will obviously cash in on the experience of having worked with Dr Paes as part of the Asian Cricket Councils high-performance project. All my experience will help me in my endeavour. My strength is working with teams, Binny remarked.         
	It was evident that Binny will be stressing on team performance, Bengals bane during the past few seasons. While individual performances havent been at a premium, Bengal have failed to perform as a unit.         
	Binny also sounded excited about working with the boys in different age-groups. I have always loved working with the juniors. I have always believed in the adage Catch them Young.         
	Having himself been a successful all-rounder, Binny is aware of the all-rounders importance in todays cricket. All-rounders are a big asset. Ill have to look around the team and find exact roles for every individual, he explained.         
	He didnt seem too keen on having a fielding coach among his support staff, but Binny was eager to utilise Sourav Gangulys experience.         
	The former India captain will not be available for the Ranji Trophy but is likely to play in the National one-dayers for the Vijay Hazare Trophy.         
	Souravs experience will be valuable Hes been such a great motivator his motivational skill will be a big asset, said the coach.         
	Binny, whose last assignment with a senior team  the Karnataka Ranji Trophy team  was in 1999-00, succeeds Utpal Chatterjee. Under Chatterjee, Bengal lost in the Ranji Trophy quarter finals after being promoted from the Plate Group and were runners-up in the Vijay Hazare Trophy.

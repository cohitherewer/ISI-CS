                                                   Budget boost for sports
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The preparations for the 2010 Commonwealth Games, to be held in Delhi, received a major boost Monday when the government allocated Rs 2, 264 crore in the proposed interim budget for the multi-event sports extravaganza.         
	Most of the sanctioned money would, however, be spent on renovating the stadiums than preparing the Indian athletes for the Games. While around Rs 1, 385 crore will go to the stadiums, the government has allocated Rs 180 crore for sportspersons.         
	However, this could still be considered a huge increase as only Rs 75 crore was granted for the preparations of the teams in the earlier budget.         
	The budget for department of youth affairs and sports has been increased by Rs 1, 480 crore and a total of Rs 3, 073 crore has been sanctioned to the ministry headed by M.S. Gill.         
	A highly satisfied Gill said: I am happy with the budget. The finance minister is continuing to provide full support to the Commonwealth Games.

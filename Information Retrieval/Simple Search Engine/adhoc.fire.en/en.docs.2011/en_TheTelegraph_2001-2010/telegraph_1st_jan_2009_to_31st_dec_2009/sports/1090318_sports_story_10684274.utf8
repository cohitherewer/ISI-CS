                                                   Ban on Antigua ground
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Tuesday banned the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua for at least 12 months from hosting international cricket following the pitch fiasco last month.         
	The ICC has informed the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) that no more international cricket can take place at the stadium until extensive remedial work is carried out and it passes an inspection by the world governing body of cricket.         
	The ICC has also given the WICB an official warning for not preparing the ground effectively for the match.         
	Appropriate work must now be carried out and monitored by the WICB before the inspection can take place. Such inspection will be conducted no earlier than 12 months from yesterday, the day the ICC informed the WICB of its decision, the ICC said in a statement.         
	Also in accordance with the process, the Richardson and the ICCs chief match referee Ranjan Madugalle then considered all the evidence, including studying video footage of the match, before passing judgment.

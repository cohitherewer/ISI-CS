The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Calm prevails in the CAB
                                                   Calm prevails in the CAB
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The frenzy that surrounded the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB)s annual general meeting (AGM) last year, on July 29, has given way to a placid and relaxed atmosphere on the eve of the 78th AGM to be held on Friday.         
	Even the debut of Sourav Ganguly in the administrative affairs of the association has failed to ruffle the CAB brass.         
	Sourav coming to the AGM is a good thing and I have said that earlier too. He is always welcome because we consider him to be a part of the CAB, said president Jagmohan Dalmiya, who is unopposed for the top post.         
	Dalmiya cited the example of Sunil Gavaskars return to the Mumbai Cricket Association as a parallel. When Gavaskar can work with the MCA, why not Sourav? Moreover, Sourav is already associated with the BCCIs technical committee, so that shouldnt be the issue. People with technical knowledge of the game are always welcome, he said, brushing aside doubts that the former India captain, who is from the rival camp, would not be welcome.         
	CAB joint-secretary Biswarup Dey went a step further in clarifying their stand on Sourav: We will definitely think of something specific for Sourav Well be glad if we can associate with some long-term plans. His suggestions for the various age-group coaching programmes would be valuable.         
	Asked whether he was relieved to be unopposed in the elections Dalmiya, the former ICC president said: Nowadays these things dont affect me.         
	While the president and the two joint secretaries (Arun Mitra and Biswarup Dey) are unopposed, five will contest for the four vice-president slots. Shibkumar Kalyani, Samar Kar, Timir Ghosh and Shibaji Dutta are the candidates from the ruling faction while Abhijit Dutta from the Howrah DSA is the opposition candidate. Dutta, who claims that his candidature is a protest against the ruling group, refused to withdraw from the contest no matter how slim his chances.         
	Prithwis Ghosh Chowdhury will be representing Belgachia United in place of Arun Mitra, who is recovering from a hip-injury.         
	Meanwhile, Dalmiya also revealed that governor Gopalkrishna Gandhis suggestion of judicious use of power and the restoration and maintenance of parks in and around the city may come up for discussion at the AGM.         
	Among the notable absentees from this years AGM are former president Prasun Mukherjee, former joint secretary Amitava Banerjee and former treasurer Tushar Sarkar  all from the anti-Dalmiya lobby. Debraj Nahata will be representing Police AC  the club Mukherjee had represented last time.         
	It is a pity that the rival faction gets disheartened so fast, mocked a CAB official.         
	Well, that sums up the mood this time around for Dalmiya and Co.!

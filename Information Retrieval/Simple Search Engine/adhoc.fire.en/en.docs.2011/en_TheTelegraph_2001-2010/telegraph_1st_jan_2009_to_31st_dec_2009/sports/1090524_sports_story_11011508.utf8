The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Our players have got the self-belief now: Gilchrist
                                                     Our players have got the self-belief now: Gilchrist
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Adam Gilchrist en route to his explosive 85 in Centurion on Friday                           
	Centurion: The Deccan Chargers rode captain Adam Gilchrists hurricane knock of 85 from 35 balls on Friday to reach the final of the Indian Premier League. The Australian great later termed the half-century his best T20 knock and said it was even better than the century he scored in last years Indian Premier League (IPL).               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q: Did you expect to beat the Delhi DareDevils, who had been leading the points table almost throughout the tournament?         
	A: I must admit, before I left my room this morning to come to the game, I wrote down on a little piece of paper what I thought would be the result today. (Gilchrist brings out a small piece of paper with scribbled notes on it) And believe it or not, I wrote that we are going to win by six wickets!         
	How much did the Herschelle Gibbs send-off by Ashish Nehra charge you up?         
	It didnt add any more steel. Whether it was done within the confines of whats acceptable or not, I would leave for the match referee to talk about.         
	Has it been more challenging to guide the Deccan Chargers side to the IPL final than winning your World Cup trophies?         
	I have never been one to rank achievements, or say one is more special than the other. All I asked my players to do in this tournament was make whatevers happening at the time the most important thing in your life at that time. When you are fielding, its the next delivery make it the most important thing in your life at that moment, because theres nothing else happening in your life at that moment.         
	From being at the bottom of the heap last year to making it to the final this year, what have you done different this season?         
	I am probably not tempted to get too reflective just yet. Theres still one game to go. Whenever the tournament finishes for us, which will obviously be on Sunday, we will sit back and assess what we have done so much better this year compared to the last year and where we can improve and things we can draw inspiration from.         
	Was it easy to make the young Indians in the side come good this year?         
	The guys were asked to work hard and they have responded. Its pretty basic stuff. The players have got self-belief now.         
	Were you disappointed not to get the century?         
	I was extremely disappointed to get out a ball before the break (strategic time out). I should have seen the side home really.         
	How would you compare the pressures in a T20 game, with that of, say an Ashes Test?         
	I think T20 cricket applies more psychological pressure and the players need to be tougher. Its at par with anything in Test cricket. Simply because theres just no time. Its like a staring competition whoever blinks first, could pay the ultimate price. Theres no time to make up for lost ground in these games. Whereas in a Test match, you can make a mistake but you have got time. There are different kinds of pressures in different forms of the game.         
	How would you rate this knock of 85?         
	Probably my best in Twenty20. I scored a hundred last year against Mumbai (Indians), but it wasnt a semi-final.         
	Virender Sehwag felt that your batting left him with no option         
	Hes put a few opposing captains in such a situation a few times. I felt the same way last year when we played them for the first time in Hyderabad. I was not the captain at that time but who was the captain didnt matter. Today (Friday), I just wanted to be positive again.         
	Do you think somebody like Glenn McGrath playing for the DareDevils could have made a difference?         
	I am very surprised that he did not get to bowl one ball this year. We cant be too critical of Delhi. They have set the benchmark the whole tournament and everybodys striving to reach that level of consistency. Their overseas players have served them very, very well. It would have been a big call if they were to play him today (Friday), considering what Nannes and their overseas batsmen have done for them.

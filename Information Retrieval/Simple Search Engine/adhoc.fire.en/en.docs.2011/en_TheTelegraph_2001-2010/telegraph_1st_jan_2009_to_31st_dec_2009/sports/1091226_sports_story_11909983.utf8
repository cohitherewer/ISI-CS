The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Reserve pool pleases Srikkanth
                                                                                                                       7                                      Reserve pool pleases Srikkanth
                      
	New Delhi: Winning the One-day International (ODI) series against Sri Lanka without key players like captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh, has proved that India has a strong pool of reserve players for the 2011 cricket World Cup, according to chief selector Krishnamachari Srikkanth.         
	Notwithstanding Dhoni and Yuvrajs absence, India defeated Lanka by seven wickets in the fourth one-dayer in Calcutta to take an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match series with the last ODI scheduled to be held at the Feroz Shah Kotla ground in Delhi on Sunday.         
	Dhoni missed the last two games, in Cuttack and Calcutta, due to a two-match ban imposed on him for his sides slow over-rate in the second ODI in Nagpur. Yuvraj had been ruled out after the third match due to a finger injury.         
	Winning the series in the absence of Dhoni and Yuvraj shows that we have strong bench strength. The youngsters have stepped in at crucial junctures. Virat Kohli came in for Yuvraj in the one-dayers while (Murali) Vijay for Gautam (Gambhir) in the Tests, Srikkanth told reporters Friday, during the Ranji Trophy quarter final match between Tamil Nadu and Delhi.         
	The good thing is that now there is healthy competition in the team. The last two months have been good and I am happy.         
	Just like Test cricket, I want the team to become No. 1 in the ODIs too. But nothing would be greater than winning the World Cup, he said.         
	We deserved to be the No.1 team in Test cricket as we have consistently done well in different conditions in the last one year.         
	We have beaten teams in their own country as well as have won at home on placid pitches, not on turning tracks, Srikkanth said.         
	I rate this side very highly because Sehwag can destroy any bowling, Tendulkar can provide the balance while Gambhir and Dravid can play for hours, he pointed out.           (PTI)

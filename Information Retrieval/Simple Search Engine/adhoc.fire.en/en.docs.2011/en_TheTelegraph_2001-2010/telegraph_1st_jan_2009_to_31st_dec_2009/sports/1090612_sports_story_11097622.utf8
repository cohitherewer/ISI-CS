The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Modest Bengal aim high
                                                   Modest Bengal aim high
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Now or never. That was the mood in the Bengal camp on Thursday, a day after their semi-final victory over Services in the Santosh Trophy.         
	Bengal last won the cup in 1999 at the same venue and even though the present lot cant be compared to the class of 99, the players believe they can end the drought. The Bengal team of ten years back boasted of Bhaichung Bhutia, Basudeb Mondal, Carlton Chapman and they just tore Goa apart in the final.         
	This team may not have players like them but I think we can make it this time. Theres a lot of bonding in this team and we are rallying around each other, said captain Habibur Rehman Mondal on Thursday.         
	There was a bit of drama in the Bengal camp on Wednesday.         
	Goalkeeper Subhashish Roy Choudhury, who had a great match on Wednesday, threatened to leave for Calcutta. Apparently he was not happy with the dressing down he got from coach Raghu Nandy after his blunder against Tamil Nadu and wanted to leave the team after making amends in the semi-final. He later decided to stay back after being pacified by IFA secretary Utpal Ganguli and team manager Prasun Banerjee.         
	Everyone makes mistakes but the way I was treated after the Tamil Nadu match made me feel unwanted. I was desperate for a good match and when it came, I thought of leaving. Now, I think I overreacted, the goalkeeper said.

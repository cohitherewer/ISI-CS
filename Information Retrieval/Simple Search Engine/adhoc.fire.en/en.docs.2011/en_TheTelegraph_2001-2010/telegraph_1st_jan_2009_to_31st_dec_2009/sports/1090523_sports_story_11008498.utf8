                                                   ITF lets off Aussies with a fine
                      
	London: Australia avoided a ban but were fined $10,000 by the world governing tennis body on Friday for forfeiting their zonal Davis Cup tie against India this month because of security concerns.         
	The International Tennis Federations (ITF) Davis Cup Committee decided that Australia would not be suspended from the 2010 competition or relegated from Asia/Oceania Zone Group I, the ITF said in a statement. Australia will lose choice of ground for their next home tie regardless of the opponent and will pay a fine of $10,000. Australia will also be liable for costs to both the ITF and to the AITA to be determined at a later date.         
	Tennis Australia (TA) had asked the ITF to move the May 8-10 Asia/Oceania tie out of the southern Indian city of Chennai but their request was rejected. It would be irresponsible of us to send our players into an area of such high risk. Davis Cup is very important to us but some things are more important than tennis, Tennis Australia president Geoff Pollard said last month.         
	Security for sports teams in the sub-continent has been questioned following the ambush of the Sri Lanka cricket teams bus in Lahore, Pakistan, in March.         
	The Indian cricket board moved the Indian Premier League IPL) Twenty20 league to South Africa after the government said providing security would be a problem due to a clash of dates with the general election. The ITF had carried out its own security inspection in Chennai and had declared the city and venue, which also staged an Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) tournament in January, safe.

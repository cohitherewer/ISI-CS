                  Michael Clarke in action on Friday                     
	Johannesburg: Michael Clarke and Brad Haddin put on a 127-run opening stand for Australia on Friday before South Africa hit back to restrict the visitors to 303 for seven in the fifth and final one-day International.               
	Chasing 304 for victory, South Africa were 138 for one at the end of 25 overs. Opener Herschelle Gibbs (73) and Jacques Kallis (40) were at the crease. The hosts require another 166 runs from 25 overs to win the series 4-1.               
	Clarke smashed 10 boundaries to score 66 and Haddin hit seven fours and a six for 62 as the pair gave the Australians a solid start at Wanderers stadium.         
	Ricky Ponting (40) and Callum Ferguson (41) got starts before being dismissed as South Africa took seven for 119 in the middle overs.         
	However, Michael Hussey (49 not out) and Nathan Hauritz (24 not out) added a 57-run partnership in the final 10 overs to boost the total.         
	South African part-time spinner JP Duminy took three for 48 and left-arm spinner Roelof van der Merwe two for 44 to slow the scoring.         
	South Africa lead 3-1 and have already clinched the series. After Clarke and Haddin had put on their second hundred stand in as many matches, Haddin sliced a ball high from Albie Morkel and was caught by Duminy in the covers in the 20th over.         
	Three overs and 11 runs later, Clarke pulled a ball from Van der Merwe delivery to Duminy at square leg.         
	Ferguson chipped a delivery in the 32nd over from Van der Merwe to AB de Villiers in the covers to end a 54-run partnership with Ponting. Ferguson collected five fours.         
	Between the 31st and 41st overs, Van der Merwe and Duminy took a combined five wickets for only 54 runs.         
	Ponting was the next to fall, attempting to clear the ropes off Duminy only to find Van der Merwe at long-on and leaving Australia on 223 for four in the 37th over.         
	The Australia captain hit two fours and a six in 45 balls.         
	In the 39th over, David Hussey was stumped for three off a wide bowled by Duminy, and James Hopes was run out on an identical score by a direct throw from De Villiers in the covers.         
	Two overs later, Duminy claimed his third wicket when he took a fine tumbling return catch low down to send Mitchell Johnson on his way for two.         
	South Africa made two changes from the side that won the previous three matches. Off-spinner Botha, who was reported for a suspected illegal bowling action after the fourth match in Port Elizabeth on Monday, was rested  to take the focus off him according to captain Graeme Smith  while promising left-arm fast bowler Wayne Parnell was left out. In their places South Africa included fast bowlers Morne Morkel and Makhaya Ntini.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Crowe slams Rohit
                                                   Crowe slams Rohit
                                  
	New Delhi: Former New Zealand captain Martin Crowe feels Mahendra Singhs Dhonis decision to let out-of-form Rohit Sharma bat at the No. 4 position in the fifth and final one-dayer against the Black Caps put paid to Indias chances of a clean sweep in the series.         
	New Zealand turned up with their true grit, India turned up complacent. If they really wanted to win this game and make it 4-0 then India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni should have come in at No 4.         
	As soon as Rohit Sharma walked out to bat, you sensed that New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori saw an opportunity with a young and inexperienced under-performing youngster. He was under pressure and Vettori pounced on it, Crowe wrote in his column for a website.         
	Rohit came in at a time when opener Virender Sehwag was going great guns. Crowe pointed out that the Mumbaikar frustrated Sehwag by not rotating the strike.           (PTI)

                                                     Churchill, Air India in artificial face-off
            A STAFF REPORTER            Churchills Gourmangi Singh                           
	Calcutta: The venerable Carlos Pereira, having coached East Bengal and Mohun Bagan, is well acquainted with the city, its grounds and grasses. As the coach of Churchill Brothers, the Brazilian then should have had an advantage over rivals Air India in the first semi-final clash of the IFA Shield on Tuesday.         
	But there in lies the twist in the tale. Carloss familiarity with the Salt Lake Stadium would be negated as the match will be played on the newly laid artificial turf, and that too for the first time.         
	Amidst a plethora of views suggesting the probable advantages and disadvantages of the virgin turf, Carlos sounded confident on the eve of the match. The turf cannot be an excuse because we have been allowed to practice over here. Also, we had practised on similar turf in Goa, he summed up.         
	Air India coach Bimal Ghosh, on the other hand, expressed concerns over the pitch. The match will be played in the afternoon and Im not to sure as how the turf will react to the heat, he said.         
	Ghosh added: On such a turf, fitness will be the key. The bounce in the new surface also appeared to be dicey with the players offering different opinions.         
	Churchill will be without their star sniper Okolie Odafe, due to a double booking. But the coach refuses to count that as a setback: Churchill are not only about Odafe.         
	Arindam Bhattacharya will be replace Lalit Thapa under the bar.         
	Carlos has introduced some innovative drills, which were on display at the practice session on Monday. Concentrating on light with-the-ball drills, Carlos was visibly emphasising on his wards enjoying the session. Spot-kick practices were also on the agenda.         
	Air India will have a full side at their disposal. Nigerian Dbiusi Opara will once again be crucial for the Mumbai team, which lacks experience. Odafes absence will augur well for Ghoshs boys though he said: That wont give us a huge advantage Well have to watch out for the rest of the side if we want to win. They are a very good side.         
	The lush green surface, it has to be admitted, is a welcome sight for any ground in the city in this time of the year, though it remains to be seen as to who has the rub of the green.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Captain Kallis downplays tension in team
                                                     Captain Kallis downplays tension in team
                  Kallis                     
	Cape Town: South Africas stand-in captain Jacques Kallis is more worried about another slow start than about complacency ahead of the third Test against Australia.         
	Kallis, who is standing in for the injured Graeme Smith, said South Africa has struggled during the first two days in the previous two Tests. Australia lead the three-match series 2-0.         
	Weve not been complacent, I think weve been outplayed, Kallis said. Australia turned it around against us in Sydney (in January). We have to take note of what they did in Sydney, we have to do that here.         
	Like coach Mickey Arthur on Tuesday, Kallis tried to downplay talks of tensions among the South Africa players after a series of squad changes and Ashwell Princes captaincy being withdrawn a day after it was announced.         
	I think its been a bit overblown, Kallis said, adding that Prince had voluntarily decided to give up the captaincy. I have no issue with (Prince). We have had a chat. The guys respect his point of view and they respect it that I have taken over.         
	Kallis explanation seemed to be at odds with the earlier stance of Cricket South Africa (CSA), which said Prince was initially named as captain only because he was the official vice-captain. The CSA said it decided to withdraw the captaincy to allow Prince to concentrate on his new position of opening batsman.         
	On the field, South Africa will likely have to modify how their attack operates in the third Test. The one new bowler the Proteas are expected to select is right-arm seamer Albie Morkel, who will replace his younger brother Morne.         
	Kallis said the elder Morkel would bowl to contain more than attack, although Arthur said on Tuesday that the test debutant could be a useful practitioner swinging the ball back into the Australian left-handers, an area where the Proteas attack had struggled in the first two Tests.         
	The level of attack from various bowlers will depend on the game situation, Kallis said.         
	He added that the team had worked on new plans to counter the effectiveness of rookie opener Phillip Hughes, who scored two centuries against them in the Durban Test. (AGENCIES)

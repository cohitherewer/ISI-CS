The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India rip the hosts apart in truncated first ODI
                                                     India rip the hosts apart in truncated first ODI

	Napier: India Tuesday bounced back with a solid batting display to spank New Zealand by 53 runs on the basis of the Duckworth-Lewis method in the rain-marred first cricket one-dayer to take a 1-0 lead in the five-match series.         
	India rode on skipper Mahendra Singh Dhonis unbeaten 84 and blistering half-centuries by Virender Sehwag (77) and Suresh Raina (66) to rattle up 273 for four in 38 overs. The visitors then produced a disciplined bowling performance to settle the issue.         
	Players of the two teams wore black armbands during the match as a mark of respect towards Sri Lankan cricketers, who were injured in a terror attack in Lahore.         
	Rain-interruptions added to the woes of the hosts, who were given a stiff target of 216 to chase from 28 overs when drizzle halted play for the second time in the match. The Black Caps could manage just 162 for nine.         
	They were 111 in 20.5 overs while chasing the original target of 274 from 38 overs when play was suspended and upon resumption Daniel Vettoris boys were left with the daunting task of scoring 105 runs off 7.1 overs. After the first rain break, the match was reduced to 38 overs per side.         
	Martin Guptill (64) and Ross Taylor (31) scored the bulk of the runs for the hosts. Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh (3/27) and paceman Praveen Kumar (2/28) shone with the ball for India.         
	India were on the top of their game today as their batting, except a lull in the middle overs, was awesome, with Suresh Raina providing the thrust with a 39-ball 66.         
	Their bowling was sharp and disciplined, with Praveen Kumar taking the wind out of the hosts sail with two crippling blows at the start, and Harbhajan Singh scything through the latter order.         
	The Black Caps did well to recover from a staggering start through Guptill and Taylor but the asking rate was always way too high to be achieved under lights.         
	Requiring 105 off 43, they lost wickets in a trice as Harbhajan Singh produced a brilliant spell and came close to a hattrick in the 24th over. (PTI)

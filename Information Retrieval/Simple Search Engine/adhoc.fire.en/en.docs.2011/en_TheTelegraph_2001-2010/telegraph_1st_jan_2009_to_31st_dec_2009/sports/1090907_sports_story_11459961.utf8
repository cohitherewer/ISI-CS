                                                     Chanda, Short battle ends in draw
            BIPIN SHENOY            GM Le Quang Liem in action at the Gorky Sadan on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Defending champion GM Viktor Laznica of the Czech Republic and GM Le Quang Liem of Vietnam joined GM Sandipan Chanda at the top to be in joint lead on 5 points after the 6th round of the Kolkata Open Grandmaster Chess Tournament at Gorky Sadan Sunday.         
	All eyes Sunday were on the Sandipan Chanda-Nigel Short game, on the top board, where sparks were expected to fly.         
	Short opted for an unusual opening set-up against Sandipans queen-pawn opening. Sandipan castled long and an interesting battle ensued. Sandipan marched up his kingside pawns which Short countered by effectively manoeuvring his knights on the opposite wing. Short spurned the city-based GMs offer of a draw on the 24th move only to come up with one himself, on the 29th move.         
	Despite being in a slightly better position at that point, Sandipan promptly accepted as he had little time left on the clock.         
	Sandipan now faces GM Viktor Laznikov in the 7th round Monday. They have played each other only once, last year, in the same tournament and the game was drawn.         
	GM Viktor Laznicas attack down the g-file netted him GM Ziaur Rahamans queen for two rooks and a pawn.         
	Laznicas queen proved too powerful in the endgame and Ziaur threw in the towel on the 54th move.         
	GM Le Quang Liem faced little resistance from GM Enamul Hossain of Bangladesh in a Kings Indian defence.         
	Liem gave up a piece for obtaining an unstoppable passed pawn on the queenside.         
	Eight players, including GM Nigel Short and GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly, occupy the second spot on 4.5 points. After a string of draws, Surya Sekhar came back into reckoning with a fine victory over compatriot Abhijit Kunte in a Sicilian defence. He meets GM Le Quang Liem with the white pieces Monday on the second board.         
	FM Sahaj Grover upstaged yet another GM when he beat the 5th seed Gadir Guseinov of Azerbaijan with white pieces Sunday.         
	The 14-year-old Sahaj has taken on six GMs on the trot and meets another one G.N. Gopal in the next round. Apart from Guseinov, he has beaten GM Reefat Bin-Sattar and GM Persson Tigar Hillarp while drawing against GM Neelotpal Das and GM Parimarjan Negi. He has lost only to GM Ziaur Rahaman of Bangladesh.

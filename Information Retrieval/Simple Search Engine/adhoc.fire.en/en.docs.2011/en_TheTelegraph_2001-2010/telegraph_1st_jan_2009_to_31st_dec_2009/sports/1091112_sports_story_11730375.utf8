The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Heavy rain has Bagan marooned 
                                                                                                                                   Heavy rain has Bagan marooned 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Heavy rain in Pune has left Mohun Bagan virtually marooned. Mohun Bagan are scheduled to play Pune FC on Friday in their eighth I-League encounter. With local authorities in Pune issuing a cyclone alert Bagan had no choice but to stay indoors throughout the day.         
	Its raining heavily and its so windy that its difficult to stay out even for a minute, coach Karim Bencharifa said from Pune. We had an indoor session which obviously is not adequate to prepare for a match like this.         
	Apparently Mohun Bagan had to live in darkness for quite a some time in the hotel before power was restored.         
	Heavy rains since Tuesday night has also rendered the ground at Balewadi and chances are there for a postponement if weather gods refuse to relent.         
	A postponement will be a blessing for the Bagan side. With Marcos Pereira, Edeh Chidi, N. Mohanraj nursing minor injuries Bagan would be the last one to complain if the All India Football Federation postpones the match. With I-League not resuming before January, this also gives the injury-hit team a chance to recuperate.

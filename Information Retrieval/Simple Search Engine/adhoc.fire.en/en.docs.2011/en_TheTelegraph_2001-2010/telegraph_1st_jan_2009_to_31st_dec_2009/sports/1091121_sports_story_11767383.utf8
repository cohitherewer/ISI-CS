            A STAFF REPORTER            Sourav                           
	Calcutta: A day after zeroing in on Jadavpur University (JU)s Salt Lake campus ground as the venue for Bengals Ranji Trophy match against Saurashtra, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), following a request from former India captain Sourav Ganguly, has decided to shift the match back to Eden Gardens.         
	It was learnt that Sourav was a bit worried about the security arrangements at the JU ground as it is an open venue inside the campus.         
	Sourav, sources said, had a discussion with CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya where he also expressed reservations about the JU pitch.         
	CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey also met senior police officers but they couldnt give any assurance about police deployment. We have decided to shift the match back to Eden Gardens as there were security problems, Dey said.         
	The CAB had earlier decided to shift the match to the university ground to speed up the renovation work at the Eden.

	Calcutta: Chirag United Monday last and JCT on Thursday. Mohun Bagans I-League campaign has absolutely got off on the wrong foot. A 10-man Bagan crashed to their second consecutive defeat at the Salt Lake Stadium, going down 1-2 to the team from Phagwara.         
	Although the city giants had a couple of opportunities to score in the first half, it was only in the second when the drama began and the match came alive. There were eight yellow cards with Deepak Mondals double booking earning him a red.         
	After a goalless first-half, JCTs lone foreign player, the Nigerian Penn Orji, slammed the ball into the Bagan net in the very first minute after the change of ends for the visitors to go 1-0 up.         
	Sakatar Singh failed to control Balwant Singhs pass, Bagans Zenith Genius failed to clear it and the ball fell to Penn whose shot proved too good for Bagan goalkeeper Shilton Paul.         
	Then it was Baljit Singh Sahnis turn to show what he can do. In the 56th minute, the first striker to have scored a hattrick in this seasons I-League, blocked off Bagan defender Rakesh Masih before slotting the ball home.         
	JCT, fresh from their victory over Lajong FC in their league opener, could have gone 3-0 up but substitute Jaswinder Singh dithered when he got the chance in the 80th minute.         
	Looking for a way back into the game, Bagan were rejuvenated by Branco Cardozos stunning strike from a Snehasish Chakraborty pass in the 83rd minute. The Goan strikers swerving right footer from the left flank went into the far post and it seemed Bagan, after all, had a different idea.         
	However, injuries hurt both teams. Bagan left-back Mohanraj took a Baldeep Singh kick to his chest in the 64th minute.         
	 The defender collapsed near the box and began vomiting. He had to be taken off the field in an ambulance. He is in a stable condition but has been kept under observation.         
	In the 71st minute, JCTs Sakatar collided with Zenith and both had to get their heads bandaged.         
	An unprecedented 10 minutes were added on and, in its very first minute, Bagan captain Deepak Mondal was shown his second yellow card for tackling Balwant. In the 97th minute Bagan were awarded a free-kick from a promising position, but Marcos Pereira failed to make it count.

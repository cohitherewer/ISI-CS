            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Rashmi Sharma, who recently crossed the English Channel for a third time, wants to swim across and back in her next attempt.         
	I know its very difficult but my target will be to swim the English Channel across and back Its my dream, the 20-year-old said on Wednesday.         
	She was most satisfied with her feat this time because she was very confident and had to swim in cold conditions.         
	Richa, who partnered sister Rashmi to swim across the Strait of Gibraltar on August 7, is also excited about her feat.         
	The 17-year-old, who is also a keen boxer, said: I was a bit scared at the outset. The sea was rough at the start but conditions improved and worsened again.

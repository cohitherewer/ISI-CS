                                                   AI beat Vasco
                      
	Mumbai: Air India finally ended their winless stretch that extended for ten games defeating Vasco SC of Goa by a lone second-half goal in the 20th round I-League match at the Cooperage Sunday.         
	Subash Singh scored in the 67th minute, his seventh strike in the tournament, in the match which was marred by drab football from both the opponents.         
	Singh, grabbing a header from Nigerian striker Emmanuel Ovieghara put it into the net with a left-foot precision. The airmen missed scoring the second goal when Surajit Roy hit wide of a Soccor Velhos cross.         
	Vascos closest chance, which came on the half-hour mark however, was brilliantly thwarted by AI custodian Arup Debnath. The victory boosted AIs point tally to 23 while Vasco remained on ten points and at the bottom of the 12-team table.

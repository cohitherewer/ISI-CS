The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dalmiya persuades Deep to continue
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dalmiya persuades Deep to continue
            A STAFF REPORTER            Deep Dasgupta                           
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Jagmohan Dalmiya stepped in Sunday to persuade Deep Dasgupta to continue playing for Bengal as the former India cricketer had expressed his unwillingness in representing Bengal.         
	Deep was miffed at the way he was treated by the team management on the eve of Bengals Ranji Trophy encounter against Karnataka, in Mysore. The team management, in fact, had named Manoj Tiwary the captain even though the CAB had given clear instructions that Deep should be appointed captain if regular skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla is not available.         
	On Sunday, Deep had a meeting with Dalmiya over breakfast, at the latters residence. It has been learnt that Dalmiya assured the former Bengal captain that his seniority shall not be undermined in future.         
	Deep said that he put forward his points during the interaction. We met today (Sunday). I said whatever I wanted, and he, too, made some points, he said.         
	However, according to sources, Dalmiya has also told Deep not to rush his decision, and consider his future with Bengal after the Ranji Trophy is over. Bengal have three group matches left. After playing Saurashtra at the Eden from Tuesday, they will be up against Uttar Pradesh and Delhi.         
	Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Rohan Gavaskar and Rohan Banerjee, suffering from injuries, underwent a fitness test Sunday, under the eyes of Dr Vece Paes.         
	While Gavaskar and Banerjee appeared ready for Tuesdays match, captain Shukla wasnt fluent in running between the wickets. Although Shukla bowled and batted at the nets, his discomfort in running was clear. According to sources, another fitness test will take place on Monday, which is specifically meant for the captain.         
	In case Shukla is not fit to play, the controversial captaincy issue will once again come up. The CAB sources said Tiwary, the stand-in-captain in the last tie, might don the captains role once again.         
	Former India captain Sourav Ganguly and Gavaskar (provided he clears the fitness test) are set to return to the playing eleven, which will be selected (quite strangely) Monday, less than 24 hours before the match.         
	Avishek Jhunjhunwala and Sayan Sekhar Mondal are likely to make way for Sourav and Gavaskar. The team management will have a problem in their hands if Shukla is declared fit. In that case, opener Arindam Das will be the unlucky one, in spite of putting up quite a decent show so far.         
	Meanwhile, Bengal manager Russi Jeejeebhoy submitted his report to Dalmiya Sunday. The CAB had sought a report from Jeejeebhoy regarding the captaincy controversy. Dalmiya, when contacted, refused to speak on the matter. He said: These things are confidential and not to be discussed.         
	Its raining controversies as far Bengal are concerned and for getting maximum points from their home match against Saurashtra, Roger Binnys wards will have to cross quite a few hurdles  both on and off the field.

	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC)s recce team that visited the Eden on Friday returned fairly satisfied with the arrangements that were being put in place for the 2011 World Cup.         
	The 13-member team, among others, included former Australia off-spinner and chief executive of the Federation of International Cricketers Associations (Fica) Tim May, ICC events manager Chris Tetley, pitch consultant Andy Atkinson and security officer John Rhodes.         
	Weve started our India leg with Calcutta. Its wonderful to be here and we are excited about the renovation currently underway at the Eden The plans are in place and the modifications will meet all our requirements, Tetley said after an almost four-hour inspection.         
	The Eden will host four matches, including an India tie, in the quadrennial showpiece.         
	After an hour-long powerpoint presentation wherein the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) highlighted their renovation plans, the team went around the ground inspecting the pitch, the players arena, the entry and exit points at various gates, the TV and media facilities and the security arrangements. In the evening, they also visited the Jadavpur University, Salt Lake campus ground, to have a look at the practice facilities.         
	The stress is on the spectators well being Special care is being taken to have proper toilets, food courts in every block. The entry and exit points should be properly marked. The parking facilities should also be conveniently located, said a member of the delegation.         
	The team has also suggested a few changes to the dressing room. They want the dressing room to be improved. There should be ample space for relaxation A separate dining space should be there adjacent to the dressing room, said a CAB official.         
	The ICC has also decided to send a delegation during the one-dayer against Sri Lanka on December 24 at the Eden to get a first hand knowledge of the security arrangements.         
	The meeting was aimed at having the two groups work together Its an ongoing process and may be many more visits will be needed, said CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya.         
	The security aspect at the Salt Lake ground also came up for discussion. The open ground can raise security concerns We need to be wary of this, a member pointed out.         
	As a backup, the CCFC ground was also shown to the delegation during a CAB-hosted dinner there.

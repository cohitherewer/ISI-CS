	Johannesburg: A century stand between skipper Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke helped Australia recover from a shaky start to reach 254 for five at close of play on the first day of the first Test against South Africa on Thursday.         
	Australia were in trouble early on at 38 for three in Johannesburg as Dale Steyn claimed two wickets and Morne Morkel took one in the opening session.         
	However, Ponting (83) and Clarkes partnership of 113 steadied things. Then debutant Marcus Norths composed 47 not out, and wicketkeeper Brad Haddin, unbeaten on 37, added 72 for the sixth wicket before bad light, followed by rain, ended play early.         
	The bowlers, myself included, would probably say we could have done better, but were not too disappointed, Steyn told reporters.         
	The day has finished close to even. The new ball is just around the corner and if we can strike early tomorrow then the advantage will belong to us, added Steyn.         
	He felt the South Africa attack had been hindered by a back injury to Jacques Kallis which kept the all-rounder off the field for a lengthy spell in the afternoon and prevented him from bowling more than four overs.         
	We havent been on the field for a full day since early January and so we battled to string the overs together, the patience wasnt really there.         
	Clarke also praised North for his valuable unbeaten 47.         
	Ponting made 83, with 11 fours and a six, before he was dismissed by Makhaya Ntini after leaving a delivery that moved in, hit the top of his pad and went on to the stumps.         
	The Australian captain had earlier been dropped by opposite number Graeme Smith at first slip off Steyn on 40 and promptly hooked the next ball for six.         
	He also won a decision reviewed to the third umpire on 70 after the South Africans disagreed with umpire Billy Bowdens not out verdict for a caught behind appeal off Morkel.         
	Clarke also went before tea for 68 after a wide, full delivery from Steyn kept swinging away and wicketkeeper Mark Boucher gratefully accepted the catch.         
	A fine new-ball spell by Steyn and a magnificent catch by Neil McKenzie in the morning had rocked Australia, who won the toss and chose to bat. Debutant Phillip Hughes fell in the first over for a duck, edging an awful cut at a Steyn bouncer into the gloves of Boucher.         
	Simon Katich (3) went to McKenzies superb one-handed catch in the gully, diving full length to intercept a back foot drive off Steyn and Morkel had Michael Hussey caught at second slip by Kallis for four.

                                                   Gambhir stays put
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Gautam Gambhir retained his place among the top 10 Test batsmen while Harbhajan Singh dropped a spot to be ranked ninth among bowlers in the latest Reliance Mobile ICC Test rankings, according to information forwarded by the International Cricket Council (ICC).         
	Jerome Taylor has become the highest-ranked West Indies Test bowler since the retirement of Courtney Walsh in 2001.         
	Taylor played a stellar role in the West Indies innings victory over England Saturday in the first Test of a four-match series.         
	The 24-year-old Jamaican was the Man of the Match with figures of 29-8-85-8, including five for 11 in the second innings as England were dismissed for 51 in 33.2 overs.         
	This most recent effort has catapulted him up 11 places to sixth spot in the Reliance Mobile ICC Player Rankings for Test bowlers, giving him a personal-best rating and putting him in a good position to launch an assault on the top five in the remainder of the series.

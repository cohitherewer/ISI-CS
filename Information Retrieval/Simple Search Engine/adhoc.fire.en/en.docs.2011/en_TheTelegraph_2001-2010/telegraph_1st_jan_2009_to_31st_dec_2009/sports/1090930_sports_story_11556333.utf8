The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woolmer in mind, Younis is eyeing glory again
                                                     Woolmer in mind, Younis is eyeing glory again
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                              
	Johannesburg: After dedicating the World T20 win to Bob Woolmer, Pakistans coach who died during the 2007 World Cup, Younis Khan now wishes to go one further: Win the Champions Trophy in the country Woolmer chose to make his home.         
	Born in Kanpur, Woolmer played for England, but had settled in South Africa.         
	It would be great if we could win in the land where Bob lies buried... It would be wonderful if I could either take the Trophy to Cape Town and place it before Mrs Woolmer or invite her here, if we do win... Woh ek bahut bada kaam ho jaye ga, the Pakistan captain told The Telegraph rather emotionally.         
	Assured of a semi-final berth, step No.1 has been reached.         
	Speaking on Tuesday, Younis added: Im not sure if you know, but Id invited Geoff Lawson (Woolmers successor, whod been sacked) to our dressing room after winning the World T20... He didnt come there, but came to our London hotel that evening and I made him pose with the trophy... After all, hed played some part in our cricket and I wanted to thank him...         
	Lawson, it may be recalled, had been engaged in radio commentary during the World T20.

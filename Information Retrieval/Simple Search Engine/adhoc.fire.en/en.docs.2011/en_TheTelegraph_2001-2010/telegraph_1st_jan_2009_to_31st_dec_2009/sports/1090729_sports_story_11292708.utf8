The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barcelona, Inter complete swap
                                                     Barcelona, Inter complete swap
                  Zlatan Ibrahimovic in Barcelona on Monday                     
	Madrid: Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic moved to Barcelona from Inter Milan and Cameroons Samuel Eto went the other way on Monday in a swap deal worth more than euros 66 million ($94.14 million), as briefly reported in Tuesdays Late City edition.         
	The two forwards signed five-year contracts, both clubs said in statements. With Eto being valued at euros 20 million, Barcelona announced they were paying a separate euros 46 million fee and loaning Belarus midfielder Aleksandr Hleb to Inter for the season.         
	Italian champions Inter, who have yet to confirm Hlebs arrival, will have the chance to buy the former Arsenal player for euros 10 million plus variables next year.         
	Barca added that Ibrahimovic, 27, needs immediate surgery on a bone fracture in his left hand and will be out for around three weeks.         
	Im not coming as a substitute for Eto because I am a very different player. I come to bring something new, Ibrahimovic told a news conference that had been delayed for more than an hour due to a last-minute complication with the deal.         
	No one knows this but months ago I told (Inter president Massimo) Moratti I wanted to play for Barca. I told him there was only one team who would be able to buy me. There are many great clubs, but only one like Barcelona.         
	Ibrahimovic passed a medical, though doctors detected the bone fracture in his left hand, picked up during Inters recent friendly against Chelsea. Ibrahimovic was presented with the No.9 shirt.         
	Eto flew to Milan earlier in the day before passing a medical. The 28-year-old told the Inter website: A new story begins at Inter, Im starting from scratch, I want a new adventure and I hope everything goes well.

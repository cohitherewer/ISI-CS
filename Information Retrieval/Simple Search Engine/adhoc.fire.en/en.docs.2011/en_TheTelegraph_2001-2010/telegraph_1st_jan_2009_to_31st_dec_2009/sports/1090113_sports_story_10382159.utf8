	Hyderabad: Rohit Sharma cracked an unbeaten century as Mumbai recovered from a miserable start to reach a decent 297 for six at close on a keenly contested opening day of the Ranji Trophy cricket final against Uttar Pradesh here on Monday.         
	Sharma led the fight-back with an unbeaten 113 and the 207-run partnership he shared with Abhishek Nayar (99) helped Mumbai survive pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumars five-wicket haul.         
	Uttar Pradesh captain Mohammed Kaifs decision to insert Mumbai on a greenish track paid rich dividends with Bhuvneshwar striking thrice.         
	The pacers early scalps included the prized wicket of Sachin Tendulkar (0).         
	The Wasim Jaffer-led side were reduced to 55 for four inside 20 overs.         
	But poor fielding soon came to hurt UP as Kaif, who otherwise has a safe pair of hands, twice dropped Rohit in the slips to allow Mumbai slacken the noose and regain much of the lost ground.         
	At stumps, Rohit and Ajit Agarkar (21) were in the middle. Rohits unbeaten 206-ball knock, which included 18 fours, may not count among his best but it came just when the team needed it most.         
	Nayar looked more solid of the duo and the left-hander hit 13 fours and a six en route to a 190-ball 99 at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium here. Bhuvneshwar, who added two more scalps in the afternoon to his morning tally, finished with figures of five for 64.         
	Put into bat, Mumbai found their skipper back in the hut in the sixth over when Bhuvneshwars inswinger trapped Jaffer (1) plumb in front of the stumps.                     
	Vinayak Samant (26) looked in all sort of problems against the UP pacers and he perished in the same manner. 13 runs later, RP Singh trapped Ajinkya Rahane (23) just when the batsman seemed to have got his eyes in.         
	The biggest blow, however, was dealt in the next over when Bhuvneshwar brought one back into Tendulkar.         
	The ball hit the inside edge of the bat and then lobbed up into the air off the pads. Shivkant Shukla dived to pouch the ball.         
	The duck turned out to be Tendulkars first in first class cricket.         
	Batting on 16, Rohit edged Praveen and was relieved to see Kaif spill the regulation catch at first slip. Kaif dropped Rohit again on 39, this time off RP Singh.         
	Rohit and Nayar survived some torrid moments, and umpteen run out chances as well. Nayar went after Piyush Chawla, coming down the track and hitting the leg-spinner over the long-on boundary and followed it up with a swept four that brought up Mumbais 200.         
	Rohit also belted the leg-spinner, hitting him for three consecutive boundaries.         
	Another four off Parvinder Singh took the stylish right-hander to 99 and a single in the same over brought up his fourth first class century.         
	At the other end, Nayar hit Parvinder Singh for back-to-back fours but the century he so thoroughly deserved eluded him.

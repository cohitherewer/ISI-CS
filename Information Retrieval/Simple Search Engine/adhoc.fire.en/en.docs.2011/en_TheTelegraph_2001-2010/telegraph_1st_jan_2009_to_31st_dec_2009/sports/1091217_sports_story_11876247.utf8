  - Ntini becomes 5th South African to play 100 Tests

	Centurion: Jacques Kallis scored his 32nd century to lead South Africa to 262 for four at stumps Wednesday on the opening day of the first Test against England.         
	Kallis was unbeaten on 112 after having put on an unbroken stand of 103 with JP Duminy and 66 with AB de Villiers to steer the Proteas to a solid total at the Supersport Park.         
	Kallis hit 14 fours and a six in 203 balls, improving his overall total in Tests to 10,389 runs as South Africas highest ever scorer. His participation in the match had been in doubt due to a rib cartilage injury but Kallis seemed untroubled at the crease, going down the pitch and smacking off-spinner Graeme Swann for a six over long-on before cracking him to the mid-wicket fence in one over.         
	We had heard England wanted to bowl first if they won the toss and there was a bit of a (green) tinge to the pitch. So we were happy with 262 for four, said Ashwell Prince, who made 45. We still have some attacking batters like Mark Boucher to come, so well be looking for something like 400.         
	England chose to go into the match with only four front-line bowlers, selecting Ian Bell to bat at No. 6 in his 50th Test.         
	South Africa fast bowler Friedel de Wet received his first cap after being selected in place of pace spearhead Dale Steyn, while quick Makhaya Ntini became the fifth South African to play 100 Tests with his selection.         
	Swann finished with two for 61, and is likely to bowl plenty of overs Thursday, especially if Onions is not fully fit.         
	The team we picked is a very good one that can win this game, Swann said. (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Prakash takes a tumble 
                                                   Prakash takes a tumble 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A failed bid at the Hall of Championships in Newport resulted in Prakash Amritrajs ranking plummeting to 254, a huge loss of 95 positions, in the latest Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) rankings released on Monday.         
	Amritraj had lost in the second round of the event, where he had a runner-up finish last year.         
	Indias top mens singles player Somdev Dev Varman also slipped three places to be 135 in the latest chart.         
	Yuki Bhambri took a huge jump of 111 positions to stand at 531.         
	It makes him Indias fourth highest ranked player followed by Vishnu Vardhan (548).         
	Vardhan won his maiden International Tennis Federation (ITF) title on Saturday.         
	Sania Mirza, who recently got engaged, gained one position in the Womens Tennis Association singles chart to be at 85 but lost one in doubles, where she stands at 42.         
	Doubles experts Leander Paes (6) and Mahesh Bhupathis (8) rankings remained unchanged.         
	The only change in the ATP top 10 singles chart from last week was Wimbledon finalist Andy Roddick moving up a spot to 5, displacing Argentine Juan Martin del Potro.         
	Roddick had also withdrawn from the US Davis Cup team due to injuries after the Wimbledon final.         
	There have been no changes in the WTAs top 10 rankings with Dinara Safina still clinging on to the top spot.

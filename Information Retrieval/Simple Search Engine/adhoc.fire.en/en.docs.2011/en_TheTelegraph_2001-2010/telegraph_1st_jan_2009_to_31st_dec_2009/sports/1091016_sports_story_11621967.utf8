	Mumbai: The inaugural edition of the Champions League T20 might have evoked lukewarm response, but the tournament is likely to be given a permanent window in the international calendar from 2012.         
	Between mid-September and early October are the dates we are looking at, right till 2020, Dean Kino, Champions League T20 governing council member and director, business and legal affairs, said.         
	Those dates have been so far allotted to either the ICC Champions Trophy or the T20 World Championship in recent years.         
	The ICC executive board has yet to finalise its new Future Tours Programme which is supposed come into effect from 2012.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Strauss miffed at Langer dossier
                                                     Strauss miffed at Langer dossier
          
	London: Andrew Strauss is not in a mood to retaliate but the England captain is clearly miffed after Justin Langers damning dossier on the English cricketers made its way to the local press.         
	Strauss said the Aussies were entitled to their opinions, but Langers observations were wide off the mark.         
	You always look for outside people to give you views on the opposition. The Aussies got him to do that but it is not of great interest to us. When you cross that white line, anything written on paper becomes irrelevant, Strauss said, indicating he was not much perturbed.         
	That it did not go down well with him was evident as Strauss came out in defence of his teammates.         
	If you look at the cricket we have played in the last nine months, I would contend that (character) is something we see in England teams, he was quoted as saying by an English newspaper.         
	Australia coach Tim Nielsen had asked Langer to compile a dossier for the English cricketers in which the former opener described Strauss and his teammates in unflattering terms.         
	Langer said the English cricketers, generally, are lazy, shallow and flat. Their fast bowler James Anderson can be a bit of a pussy if things do not go his way and Strauss can be too conservative.         
	Australia captain Ricky Ponting said the dossier was meant for the younger players in the side.         
	It was not for me because I have played as much against these guys as Justin has, so I knew the personalities and the way a lot of the guys play, Ponting said.         
	I got given a copy of it and gave it a brief read through but it was more for the younger guys in our group to get a feel about their players, he added.           (AGENCIES)

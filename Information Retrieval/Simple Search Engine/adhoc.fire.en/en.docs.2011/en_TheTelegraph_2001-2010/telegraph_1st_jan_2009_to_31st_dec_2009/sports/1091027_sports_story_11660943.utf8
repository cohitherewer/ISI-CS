                                                   Dismay for Mankad 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Harsh Mankads hopes of winning back to back and his fourth doubles title of the season were dashed after an agonising defeat in the final of the $50,000 ATP Challenger mens tennis event in Calabasas, US, on Sunday.         
	Mankad, partnering Treat Huey of the Philippines, went down 6-2, 5-7, 10-4 in a thrilling contest against Santiago Gonzalez of Mexico and Germanys Simon Stadler in the hard court tournament.         
	The pair had triumphed in Tiburon, US, last week and had won on clay in Spain last month. Mankad had also captured a title at Carson with Frederik Nielsen of Denmark in May.         
	The loss saw the duos seven-match winning streak coming to an end but Mankads fifth runner-up effort of the season meant his doubles ranking moved to a career-best 102.         
	I felt that with good partners I could do well at the Challenger level  so yes, I was hoping for this level of consistent performance, Mankad, who decided to focus on doubles play from this year following a chronic knee injury, told The Telegraph.         
	However, except for a semi-final with Purav Raja in the last week of January, things didnt go well at the start for the 29-year-old Mumbaikar.         
	Mankad reached two finals with Kaes Vant Hof and then partnered David Martin, both Americans. Then there was the title with Nielsen. But the Indian felt that the association with Huey, who is managed by the same firm that handles Somdev Dev Varman, could be a fruitful one in the long run.         
	Right now there isnt a spot for another doubles player on the Davis Cup team. Well see what happens in the future, he said.

                                                                                                                                     Aamer amazes but Black Caps prevail 
                  Ahsan Raza during the ODI between Pakistan and New Zealand in Abu Dhabi on Monday                     
	Abu Dhabi: New Zealand won the third ODI against Pakistan by seven runs Monday to clinch the series 2-1 despite Md Aamers record 73 not out at No.10 for the Pakistanis.         
	Brendon McCullum top-scored with 76 as New Zealand were bowled out for 211 at Sheikh Zayed Stadium with Saeed Ajmal taking four for 33.         
	Pakistan slumped to 101 for nine before Aamer put on 103 with Ajmal (33), who was dismissed with five balls remaining in the innings.         
	Aamer hit seven fours and three sixes in 81 balls.         
	Jacob Oram took three for 20 and Tim Southee two for 26 for New Zealand.         
	The previous highest score for a No.10 was 56 not out by Douglas Marillier for Zimbabwe against India in 1998.         
	With the series level at 1-1, New Zealand had the advantage when they won the toss on a pitch full of runs, with opening pair Brendon McCullum and Aaron Redmond making a promising start as they put on 72 for the first wicket. However, Ajmal and the other spinners gradually applied the brakes. (AP)

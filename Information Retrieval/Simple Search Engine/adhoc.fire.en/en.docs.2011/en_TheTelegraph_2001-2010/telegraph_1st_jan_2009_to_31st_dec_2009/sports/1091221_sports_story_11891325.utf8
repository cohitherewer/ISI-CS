The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sangakkara: Hope to keep our good show going 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sangakkara: Hope to keep our good show going 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack: Kumar Sangakkara doesnt seem perturbed by the loss of key players in the course of the ODI series. Rather he is hopeful that juniors will utilise the opportunities they are getting.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Expecting another run-feast at Barabati         
	We have been batting quite well so we hope to keep our good show going. I had a brief look at the wicket and it looks good.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhonis absence         
	Obviously I hope it works to our advantage. He is an in-form player and India will definitely miss him. It is a huge blow to the home team. But we will also be handicapped by the absence of Angelo Mathews, who has played a key role for us on this tour.         
	On Suraj Randiv as Muttiah Muralidharans replacement         
	Its too early to pass a judgement on Randiv. But he did bowl really well in Nagpur. He showed the right attitude and was impressive. Now he will have to show consistency at this level.         
	Dilshans dazzling form         
	He has got runs in two innings so far but we hope he gets big scores in all five innings.         
	Missing key bowlers         
	I dont see it as a loss. Rather, I would like to put it differently. The absence of senior bowlers means that some of the youngsters will be getting an opportunity to showcase their talent at the international level. They will be hungry to perform and make a mark at this level.         
	If Sri Lanka have an edge going into Mondays match         
	I only wish that theres one edge... The one that comes from (Virender) Sehwags bat.

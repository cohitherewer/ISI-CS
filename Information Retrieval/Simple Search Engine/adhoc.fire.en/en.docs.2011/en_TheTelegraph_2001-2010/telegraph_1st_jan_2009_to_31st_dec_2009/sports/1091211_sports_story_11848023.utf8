	Baku (Azerbaijan): Asian champion Suranjoy Singh continued his rampaging form to out-punch Mexicos Baulio Avila and storm into the final of the season-ending Presidents Cup Boxing Tournament here Thursday.         
	The Indian, who is competing for the Asia One team, beat his rival from the Americas Two team 10-4 in a lopsided bout.         
	The 22-year-old Manipuri will now take on Europe Twos Nordine Oubaali, a Frenchman who got a walkover in his semi-final bout, in the final Friday.         
	Suranjoy shunned aggression for caution in the opening round and preferred to counter-attack against an aggressive Avila, who is a pan-American Games bronze medallist.         
	The strategy worked well as the Indian took a slender 2-0 lead in the first three minutes.         
	It was a deliberate approach, to be defensive in the start because the other guy was going all out.         
	Suranjoy kept his cool and scored with some well-executed left straights and cross punches, national coach Gurbax Singh Sandhu, who has been invited as one of the four coaches for the two Asian teams, said.         
	Suranjoy adopted a more aggressive approach in the second round and scored through some hard-hitting uppercuts to take his lead to 7-2.         
	The final round followed a similar script and the Indian continued to dominate to eventually clinch the bout 10-4.         
	I am thrilled to be doing well in such a prestigious event. Hopefully, I can win a gold, said Suranjoy.         
	If the reigning national champion wins Friday, he would also take home a $3,000 prize along with the gold medal.         
	The winning Confederation will be awarded $ 50,000. Asia One is currently placed third in the overall standings.         
	The Presidents Cup is an inter-continental tournament where confederations from Asia, Africa, Europe, America and Oceania are pitted against each other.         
	Each time a boxer wins a bout, he earns three points for his team.         
	Indias Olympic bronze medallist Vijender Singh (75kg) had won a bronze in the inaugural edition of the event last year. He had to sit out of the ongoing edition due to a wrist injury.

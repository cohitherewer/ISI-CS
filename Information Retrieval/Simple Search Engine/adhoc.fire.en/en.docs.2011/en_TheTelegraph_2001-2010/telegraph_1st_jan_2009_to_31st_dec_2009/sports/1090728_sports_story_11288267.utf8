The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Another first for Bangladesh
                                                   Another first for Bangladesh
                      
	Roseau (Dominica): Abdur Razzak made a triumphant return to the Bangladesh side when he helped his team win the opening one-day International (ODI) against the West Indies by 52 runs, their first against the Caribbean nation.         
	Razzak, who was prevented from bowling in international cricket in December 2008 due to a suspect action before having his suspension lifted in March, took four wickets for 39 runs as Bangladesh defended a target of 247 at international crickets newest venue  Windsor Park.         
	I was not surprised when the captain gave me the new ball, especially the way the pitches have been playing in the Caribbean during this series, said Razzak.         
	I used the new ball in the 2007 World Cup (in the West Indies) as well, so its normal.         
	But this was important for me. I was out of the team for eight months, and now I am back in the side. I am looking to do well.         
	The victory gives Bangladesh a 1-0 lead in the three-match series with the second ODI scheduled for the same venue on Tuesday, and the final ODI on Friday at Warner Park in St. Kitts. Razzak exposed the West Indies frailty to spin bowling, after Bangladesh, sent in to bat, were restricted to 246 for nine from their 50 overs.         
	Mohammed Ashraful hit the top score of 57 and captain Shakib-al Hasan stroked 54 to lead the Bangladesh batting, despite Kemar Roach taking a career-best five wickets for 44 runs.         
	But Razzak, who did not play in his teams successful Test series, then gave Bangladesh a boost, when he trapped West Indies opener Dale Richards leg before for one in the second over.

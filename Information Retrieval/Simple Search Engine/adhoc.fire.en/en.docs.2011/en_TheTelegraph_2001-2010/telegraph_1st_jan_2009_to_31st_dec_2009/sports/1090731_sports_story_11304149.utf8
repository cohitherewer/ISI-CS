The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murali may quit Tests in 2010
                                                   Murali may quit Tests in 2010
                      
	Dambulla: Muttiah Muralidharan announced on Thursday that he was planning to retire from Test cricket in 2010.         
	We dont have many Test matches next year, but I am thinking that next years Test series against the West Indies (in September) will be my last two Test matches, Muralidharan, the worlds highest wicket-taker in Tests (770) and one-dayers (507), told reporters.         
	The 37-year-old has struggled with a knee injury in recent years and the problem forced him to miss the three-Test series against Pakistan.         
	With surgeons warning him that he faces long-term pain in his knee, the off spinner said his body could not cope with five-day matches for much longer.         
	I put in a lot of effort in the past month to get fit, he said after Sri Lanka beat Pakistan by 36 runs in the first one-day International.         
	The doctors told me I have to go through (the pain) and train harder because an operation will mean me being out for six to seven months. They think Ill be able to play for one to two years and told me to have the operation when I finish playing. That means my career is almost over and I am not going to play for long.         
	However, the spinner plans to carry on in the shorter forms of the game.         
	I still want to play on, if I can, till the 2011 World Cup. And Ill enjoy playing T20 for a few more years, if I can, said Muralidharan, named the Man of the Match for grabbing two wickets for 46 runs and scoring 32 runs from 15 balls.

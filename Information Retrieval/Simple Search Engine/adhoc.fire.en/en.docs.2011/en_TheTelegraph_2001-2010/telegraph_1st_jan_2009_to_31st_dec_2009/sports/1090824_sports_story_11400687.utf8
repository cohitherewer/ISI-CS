                                                     Bekele clinches a thriller
    - World meet double for ethiopian long distance runner; US women win 4X400m           
	Berlin: On a brilliant gold-medal day for the United States, LaShawn Merritt, Allyson Felix and Sanya Richards won their second World Championship titles in the 4x400 relay races, pushing their team clear in the medals table.         
	As dominant as the victories were for the American relay teams, it was tough for Kenenisa Bekele of Ethiopian, who earned a second long-distance double in as many years by adding the 5,000-metre title to his 10,000  the same feat he accomplished at the Beijing Olympics.         
	The Ethiopian extended his reign after first containing a Kenyan challenge in mid-race before withstanding defending champion Bernard Lagat of the United States in a thrilling sprint to the line.         
	Rarely was Bekele as elated, slapping his chest with an open hand and showing a beaming smile as he made it clear that others may challenge, but not conquer.         
	So was Lagat, who was running with four stitches in a numbed up left ankle after he was spiked in qualifying.         
	Bekele finished in a slow 13 minutes, 17.09 seconds, with Lagat .24 seconds behind. James Kwalia CKurui of Qatar took bronze in 13:17.78. Both silver and bronze medalists are Kenyan-born. The first man running for Kenya to finish was 2003 champion Eliud Kipchoge, a fading fifth.         
	A win for Bekele partly salvaged the Championships for Ethiopia, who saw their womens running team underperform while rival Kenya surged up the standings. Bekeles gold was Ethiopias second, compared to Kenyas four.         
	The US also got a surprise individual gold from Brittney Reese in the womans long jump, beating defending champion Tatyana Lebedeva of Russia with a jump of 7.10 metres.         
	In the final standings, the United States had 10 gold medals and 22 overall, with Jamaica second with seven gold and 13 overall.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Reds fill Alonso gap
                                                     Reds fill Alonso gap
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Aquilani                           
	Liverpool moved quickly to line up a replacement for Xabi Alonso when they agreed a deal with AS Roma to sign Italy midfielder Alberto Aquilani subject to a medical, the Premier League club said on Wednesday.         
	Liverpool have agreed a fee with Roma, thought to be around 20 million, for the transfer of Aquilani.         
	The Premier League club confirmed a deal had been struck on Wednesday afternoon, hours after Xabi Alonso completed his 30 million move from Liverpool to Real Madrid.         
	It appears that the deal for Aquilani had been in place, ready to be finalised once Alonso passed his medical at the Bernabeu.         
	Aquilani, 25, was heading to Merseyside on Wednesday afternoon and will have a medical on Thursday.         
	Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez said: Alberto is a very good player and Im delighted weve reached agreement with Roma for his transfer.         
	Alberto has a winning mentality and great experience in both Serie A and the Champions League.         
	He has long been recognised as a top-class talent in Italy, captaining his country at both under-19 and under-21 levels before establishing himself in the senior national side.         
	Aquilani was believed to be top of Rafael Benitezs list of potential replacements for Alonso. Liverpool have been able to take advantage of Romas financial difficulties in capturing a player who was a favourite of the Roma fans.         
	He can play in the position left vacant by Alonso  alongside Javier Mascherano in front of the back four.         
	As a 16-year-old, Aquilani was offered contracts by both Arsenal and Chelsea but wanted to fulfil his boyhood dream of playing for Roma.         
	He made his first-team debut at 18, when Fabio Capello was manager, but has been troubled by various injuries since becoming a Roma regular.         
	Aquilanis fitness may be a concern, so the medical will be key to the deal being completed. The player has been sidelined since surgery on his right ankle in May.         
	He last featured for Roma on March 11 when the Serie A club crashed out of the Champions League to Arsenal, and the fact he made only 14 league appearances last season because of fitness problems must be a concern at Anfield.

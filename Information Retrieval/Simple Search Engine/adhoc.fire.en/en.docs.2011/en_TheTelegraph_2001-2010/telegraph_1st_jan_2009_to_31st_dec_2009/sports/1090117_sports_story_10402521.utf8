                                                   Somdev fails to qualify
                      
	Melbourne: Somdev Dev Varmans hopes of entering the singles main draw in Australian Open went up in smoke after the lanky Indian lost his second round qualifying match to Lukasz Kubot of Poland here Friday.         
	Seeded 28th, Somdev went one up before his opponent staged a brilliant comeback to pip him 4-6, 6-4, 7-5 after nearly three hours of marathon fight.         
	Fresh from his runners-up finish in the Chennai Open, world No.154 Somdev converted both the breakpoints and defended one as well to wrap up the first set in 37 minutes.         
	But The 207th ranked Kubot turned the tables on him in the second set, breaking Somdev once and holding his serve to draw parity.         
	In the marathon see-saw decider, too, Kubot prevailed, converting three breakpoints as against Somdevs two.           (PTI)

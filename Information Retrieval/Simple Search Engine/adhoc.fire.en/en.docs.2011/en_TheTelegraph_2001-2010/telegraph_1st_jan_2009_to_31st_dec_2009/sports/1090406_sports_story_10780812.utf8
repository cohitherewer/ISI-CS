	 Gautam Gambhir crossed 1000 runs in away Test matches in just 10 matches and 17 innings. He is now the second quickest among Indians to do so after Sunil Gavaskar (in eight matches and 15 innings) to reach this landmark. Meanwhile, Gambhir has now equalled this record by a left-handed batsman in Tests: Australian Arthur Morris had also reached his 1000 away runs in 10 matches and 17 innings.         
	 Gambhir (167) became the first Indian left-hander to record a 150-plus score away from home. Sourav Gangulys 147 at SSC, Colombo, in August 1997 was the previous best score by a left-hander in an away Test for India.         
	 This is Gambhirs fourth 300-plus series aggregate in a row  a feat no other Indian left-hander has achieved before. The aggregates are: 310 runs versus Sri Lanka, 463 versus Australia, 361 versus England and 445 versus New Zealand.         
	 Gambhir joins Mohammed Azharuddin, Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar to become the fourth Indian to register two Test hundreds in New Zealand.           COMPILED BY MOHANDAS MENON

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bolt takes 200m title
                                                   Bolt takes 200m title
                      
	Kingston: Double Olympic champion Usain Bolt won the Jamaican 200 metres national title on Sunday, his first run at that distance this year, but conceded he is far from top shape ahead of the world championships in August.         
	After bursting through the bend, Bolt eased off in the final stages to finish with a time of 20.25 seconds, nearly a full second shy of his world record 19.30 set at the final of the Beijing Games last year.         
	Im feeling alright, Im a little bit tired because I am not really in the best shape of my life, but Im OK, Bolt said after the race.         
	There were a lot of fast guys behind me so I ran the corner pretty hard and then I came off and saw where I was and shut it down  it was ok, said Bolt. (Reuters)

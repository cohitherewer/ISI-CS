    Melbourne: Australia captain Ricky Ponting will remain at the helm in all three formats of the game till the 2011 World Cup, chief selector Andrew Hilditch said. 
    Hilditch ruled out having different captains for the Test and limited overs squads and said while Ponting might skip a tourney here and there, he would lead Australia in all major events.
    ldquo;Leadership issues are things that we always think about but we are really confident that Ricky will be more than capable of getting through to the 2011 World Cup, and I know that is something he would like to do, so I don rsquo;t see that as being an issue, rdquo; Hilditch told an Australian daily.
    Despite Clarke rsquo;s growing reputation, Hilditch believes there was no need to rush to hand over the limited over captaincy to the youngster. 
    Yousuf view
    Karachi: Mohammed Yousuf has made it clear that even if the Indian Cricket League (ICL) is not willing to release him he would no longer play for them and his decision to resign is final.
    ldquo;I have sent them my resignation and also submitted a copy to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), rdquo; Yousuf said Monday.
    ldquo;I am hearing the ICL has said it knows nothing about my resignation and that they are not accepting it. Anyway my decision is final as I want to play for Pakistan again, rdquo; Yousuf said.
    ldquo;I have not received any payments from them so far so I think I am justified if I want to resign. I have no complaints against them, rdquo; he said.
    PCB unhappy
    Karachi: Pakistan rsquo;s chief curator Agha Zahid is set to face the music with the PCB top brass feeling let down by the pitches used in the recent one day series against Australia in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.
    The growing belief in the PCB is that the efforts made and money spent by PCB to prepare pitches that would suit their team have gone down the drain after Australian wrapped up the ODI series.
    Sources in the board said that PCB Chairman Ejaz Butt and other officials were unhappy with the way the pitches had played and the curators and groundsmen would be questioned about it after the series.
    Mir to lead
    Karachi: Pakistan Monday dumped all-rounder Urooj Mumtaz and replaced her with Sana Mir as the new captain of the Twenty20 Women rsquo;s World Cup team.After a disappointing show in the World Cup in Australia, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and selectors here have also brought in a new coach in Mansoor Rana. The selectors have, however, retained Urooj in the World Cup squad.
    Bopara wish
    London: Ravi Bopara is determined to prove his maiden Test hundred in Barbados this year was no fluke after being picked at No. 3 for England rsquo;s series opener against the West Indies here at Lord rsquo;s beginning on Wednesday.

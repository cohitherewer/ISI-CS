The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Too close: Brendon
                                                     Too close: Brendon
    - Twenty20 World champions lose second match in a row             A CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Wellington: Brendon McCullum showed nerves of steel in winning a last-ball thriller for New Zealand Friday but said after the match that he wished it was over earlier. The swashbuckling wicketkeeper added that he had his heart in his mouth when his stroke off the last ball went high up in the air.               
	The following are excerpts         
	If he was prepared for a last-ball finish         
	I wish we could win the game a lot earlier than that. But the way (Irfan) Pathan bowled was outstanding. We had to try something different. Thats why I came down the wicket in the last two or three balls, so that I could put him under a little bit of pressure.         
	If he had his heart in his mouth when the last ball went up in the air         
	Yeah, I thought I hit it straight up and it would have been disappointing to bat through the innings not winning the game. It would have been pretty frustrating.         
	On the difficulties he faced         
	I had to work a little bit harder and the responsibility of trying to bat through the innings was also on my shoulders. Thankfully, I have been able to do it in both games.         
	If he is looking forward to playing an innings like this in the ODI series         
	Yeah I think so. Tonight (Friday) was more satisfying for me than the other night, though any time you finish a game for your country, you are incredibly satisfied. Today (Friday) was just a little bit better in how I got my runs. I was a little more aggressive up front and was able to work the ball around through the middle overs and try and create some partnerships. Theres definitely something there for the one-dayers. Hopefully, I can try and carry this approach to ODIs.         
	On how his batting has changed this year         
	Last year I was in a pretty good vein of form and things happened a little bit differently than this year. Probably Im not hitting the ball as well as I did last year.         
	On having his brother at the other end         
	All brothers who play international sport dream of occasions like those. I was really impressed when he came out to bat, the first thing he said was: Wouldnt it be great for us to finish this off? So he was nice and relaxed and did a good job in getting me back on strike. He sort of said well try and get one and get me back on strike and that seemed the right option.

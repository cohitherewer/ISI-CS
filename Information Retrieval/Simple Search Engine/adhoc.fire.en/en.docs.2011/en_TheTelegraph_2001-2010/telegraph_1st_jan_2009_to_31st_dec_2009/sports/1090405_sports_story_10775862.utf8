The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Were shattered, admits Taylor
                                                   Were shattered, admits Taylor
                      
	Wellington: New Zealand were at the receiving end of a devastating spell of seam bowling by Zaheer Khan on Saturday and their middle-order batsman Ross Taylor said the bowler used his shortened run-up to lethal impact.         
	Zaheer bowled mostly with a shortened run-up, running through the hosts top order with figures of five for 65 to help India take a 182-run first-innings lead on the second day of the third Test.         
	Zaheer cut a yard of his run up, but he bent his back and hurried the batsmen. He bowled extremely well and deserved this fiver, said Taylor, who top-scored with a stodgy 42 in the home teams 197 all out.         
	The right-hander said the home team were shattered with the visitors performance Saturday but said they have not lost hope of turning the tables on India with a strong response in the remaining days.         
	We are shattered. We have only batted 65 overs. It is very disappointing. We could not give our bowlers enough rest. We just did not apply ourselves as well as we should have done, he said.         
	It is going to be very difficult. But we have to take a positive frame of mind tomorrow (Sunday). A lot of things have to go our way to give ourselves a chance of getting back into the game, said Taylor.         
	Although some commentators expressed doubts about his dismissal, Taylor said it was a correct decision.           (PTI)

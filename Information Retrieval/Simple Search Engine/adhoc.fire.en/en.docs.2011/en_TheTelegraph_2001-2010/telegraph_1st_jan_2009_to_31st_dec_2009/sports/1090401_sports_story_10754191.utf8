The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India wont win more than one medal in 2012, feels Saina
                                                     India wont win more than one medal in 2012, feels Saina
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Saina Nehwal                           
	Mumbai: Saina Nehwal believes that contrary to expectations, India would struggle to win more than one medal at the 2012 Olympics in London.         
	India won three medals at the Beijing Games, including its first individual gold by Abhinav Bindra in air rifle shooting, prompting sports administrators to claim that sports in the country had come of age.         
	But Nehwal, who has shot to world No.9 in badminton, was of the opinion that winning medals at Olympics would not be easy. Many people are saying that we will come back with 10 medals and so on. But I think we are not going to win more than one from the next Olympics, Nehwal said at a function here on Tuesday.         
	Nehwal made the observation while she was trying to put into perspective the rise of Indian badmintons profile, with five players, men and women, placed in the world top-50 rankings.         
	A lot of cricket is happening  nobody wants to take it (badminton) up professionally. It is not easy to be ranked number eight or nine. A lot of sacrifices have to be made and still not many are ready to do that. So maybe once in 10 years we will have a Saina Nehwal, she said.         
	Also present on the occasion was Indonesian badminton star Taufik Hidayat who won the Indian Open title in Hyderabad on Sunday.         
	Hidayat said he was keen to win the All-England Championship title, the one trophy that was missing from his cabinet.         
	I have won the World Championships and the Olympics gold in 2004. The All-England title  I am training hard to win it next year. If I miss, I dont know, Hidayat grinned.

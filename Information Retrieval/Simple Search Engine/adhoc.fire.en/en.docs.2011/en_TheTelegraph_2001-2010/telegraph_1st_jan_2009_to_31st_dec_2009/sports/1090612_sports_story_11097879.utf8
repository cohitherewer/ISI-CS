            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	London: The technical committee of the World T20 has given the green signal to Virender Sehwags replacement, Dinesh Karthik.         
	The okay was given on Thursday morning after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) furnished all relevant documents.         
	Karthik wasnt cleared on Wednesday, as was claimed by Team India manager V. Chamundeshwaranath.         
	Till Thursday morning, the BCCI hadnt sent all the papers, which are mandatory. Once that was done, the tournaments technical committee gave the green signal, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	Shockingly, initially, the BCCI only sent the team physios report and not a doctors certificate. And, so, this delay.

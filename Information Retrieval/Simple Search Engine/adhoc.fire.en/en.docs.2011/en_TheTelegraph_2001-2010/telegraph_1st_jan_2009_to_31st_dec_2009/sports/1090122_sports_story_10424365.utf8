The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | An apology
                                                   An apology
                      
	A mix-up led to the Mohammedan Sporting goalkeeper being identified as Naseem Akhtar in the Mohammedan Sporting-Mumbai FC I-League match report which appeared in these columns on January 21. The goalkeeper was, in fact, Tharangachan Tungshang. Our apologies to Akhtar and to our readers.

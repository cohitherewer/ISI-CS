    - Dhonis men take on West indies with a mission and a prayer           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni                                 
	Johannesburg: Even the most gifted scriptwriter couldnt have visualised the Indian cricketers actually wanting Pakistan to win!         
	All for selfish reasons, no doubt, but thats exactly how the 2009 Champions Trophy-cookie has crumbled for Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men.         
	Indeed, the abandonment of Mondays match against world champions and holders Australia, in Centurion, has almost knocked Team India out of the tournament.         
	Beginning with the praying, theres just too much to do on Wednesday.         
	To qualify for the semi-finals, Dhoni and Co. have to (a) hope that Pakistan thrash Australia in the day game at Centurion and (b) that they themselves whip the West Indies in the day-night match at the Wanderers here.         
	Its an ask taller than the Petronas Towers in KL.         
	In fact, theres every chance that even a massive win against the under-strength West Indies may mean nothing. So far, the Floyd Reifers have merely been completing the numbers in this edition.         
	However, the wicket at the Wanderers was back to doing quite a bit, on Tuesday, and the West Indies quicks can be expected to make things hot even if the temperature again dips in Johannesburg.         
	As things stand in Group A, Pakistan are assured of one semi-final berth, with Australia set to take the other.         
	Our strategy and the composition of our XI would be clear by the afternoon, by when the first innings of the Pakistan-Australia game would be over... Its an odd match for us, where therell be everything to achieve, Dhoni said.         
	He added: Hopefully, Pakistan will win... One may expect Indian fans to cheer for them... I wouldnt say theres a winning formula as such, for if there was one, then all teams would be applying it... Younis Khans a good captain, I dont need to give any advice.         
	According to Dhoni, his team had been doing everything to prepare well. On days, weve put in four-five hours of practice... One can accept defeat as long as one has prepared well... Ive always maintained that winning and losing is part of the game.         
	Asked if hed been concerned by, among other things, a fall in his quicks pace, Dhoni replied: Not really... The bigger concern is over line and length... South Africa had the fastest, but they went for runs... Line and length counts for the most...         
	Dhoni made the point that if a policy of rotation was to be implemented and the bench strength wasnt exactly up to it, then a few defeats wouldve to be accepted. He added: Rotation is a process of saving the big players and giving exposure to the younger ones.         
	Rotation hasnt been attempted in South Africa, but the non-availability of Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh and Zaheer Khan (all through injuries) has left a huge hole.         
	While no decision has been taken on the XI, Dinesh Karthik may make it at the expense of a specialist bowler if the batting needs to be strengthened.         
	Five specialists, including Amit Mishra, were fielded against Australia.         
	Meanwhile, Pakistan dont intend doing India a favour, but dont want to lose momentum either. Weve won two matches and momentum is important, a member of the team management told The Telegraph.         
	Not that favours have really been granted, but the Andrew Strauss-Graeme Smith showdown the other night has taken the no-holds-barred bit in cricket to another level.         
	Ive got to look at whats good for my team... It would be nice to beat Australia... Its always good to win against top teams... Things shouldnt become political... Personally, Id like a Pakistan-India final... Id said the same thing during the World T20, Younis maintained.         
	Match starts: 6 pm (IST).

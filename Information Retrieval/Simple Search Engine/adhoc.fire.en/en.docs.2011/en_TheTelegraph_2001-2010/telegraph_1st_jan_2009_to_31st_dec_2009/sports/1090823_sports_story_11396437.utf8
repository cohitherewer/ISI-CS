                                                   Australia recall Voges
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Middle order batsman Adam Voges was named in Australias 15-member squad for the Champions Trophy on Saturday.         
	The tournament will be played in South Africa from September 22 to October 5.         
	The 29-year-old Voges has played only one ODI, in 2007. He scored a century for Nottinghamshire in the county championships earlier this month.         
	The squad, led by Ricky Ponting, includes only a handful of experienced players with the prominent ones being vice-captain Michael Clarke, Brett Lee and Michael Hussey, a Cricket Australia statement said.         
	National selection panel chairman Andrew Hilditch said the selectors named a squad for the Champions Trophy which was similar to the squad assembling in England to play the hosts in the ODI series after the Ashes.         
	The Champions Trophy is a key event on ICCs cricket calendar and is a good opportunity for us to see how this new-look Australian one-day squad goes in its bid to retain the trophy, Hilditch said.         
	The one-day team hasnt played in a major tournament since the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup, and this will be a good chance to see where we are at, Hilditch said. The team is in a rebuilding phase and we look forward to seeing how this squad goes in England and South Africa as we prepare for the 2011 ICC World Cup in the subcontinent.         
	The squad         
	Ricky Ponting (captain), Michael Clarke (vice-captain), Nathan Bracken, Callum Ferguson, Brad Haddin, Nathan Hauritz, Ben Hilfenhaus, James Hopes, Michael Hussey, Mitchell Johnson, Brett Lee, Peter Siddle, Adam Voges, Shane Watson, Cameron White.

	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting lodged official complaint with the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) on Thursday against Kalighat batsman Anustup Majumdar and umpire Mukesh Sinha.         
	Incidentally, Mohammedan Sporting had refused to play their first division league match against Kalighat on Wednesday accusing their opponents of tampering with the ball.         
	According to CAB sources, Mohammedan Sporting accused umpire Sinha of not taking proper steps during the ball tampering incident on Wednesday. The club also accused Kalighats Anustup Majumdar of applying vaseline on the ball.         
	Meanwhile, the CAB tournament committee has asked YMCA to produce documents to support their protest against Kalighats Sonu Sharma.

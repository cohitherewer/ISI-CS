	Calcutta: Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla must be a touch disappointed after his pacers frittered away the advantage gained after the first two sessions of their Ranji Trophy Super League encounter against Baroda at the Eden on Tuesday.         
	At stumps, Baroda were 219 for six, courtesy an unbeaten 73-run seventh wicket partnership between comeback man Irfan Pathan (42 batting, 4x4, 1x6) and wicketkeeper Pinal Shah (41 batting, 5x4). Play was suspended after 80 overs due to fading light.         
	Irfan and Pinal regained some ground for the visitors who lost three wickets in each of the first two sessions. Precariously placed at 146 for six, the duo batted for the next 116 minutes hardly taking any risks.         
	They ran the quick singles and some cheeky twos, punctuated with occasional boundaries. Only once did Irfan really chance his arms when he pulled a short one from debutant Sayan Sekhar Mondal over deep fine leg for a six.         
	It proved to be a good toss to win for skipper Shukla on an Eden strip that had a tinge of green. Pacer Sourav Sarkar (2/50), who replaced Ashok Dinda (doing duty for the Board Presidents XI), made sure that his skippers decision was vindicated as he removed opener Satyajit Parab (1) and No. 3 Azhar Bilakhia (0) in his second and teams fourth over.         
	An inswinger castled Parab while Bilakhia chased a widish delivery only to be snapped up by Arindam Das stationed at third slip.         
	At seven for two, Baroda skipper Conor Williams paired up with veteran Jacob Martin and started the repair job. Their cause was helped by Ranadeb Bose (1/56), who failed to strike rhythm. Bose was guilty of wasting the new ball as he sprayed on either side of the wicket.         
	The duo added 60 runs without any fuss. Mondal got a chance to bowl in the 13th over of the innings.         
	A few deliveries did get past the edge of Martin, but he couldnt make much of headway. Shukla (2/38) provided the much needed breakthrough when Williams (30) edged an away going delivery to be caught by keeper Deep Dasgupta.         
	Shukla trapped Rakesh Solanki (9) plumb in front with the total at 88.         
	Things got worse when a brilliant piece of fielding by Mondal at cover saw the end of Martin (46). Martin drove a half volley from Bose and was caught inches above ground by the youngster.         
	Yusuf Pathan, who smashed 183 when the two sides met last time in Baroda, started in his usual whirlwind fashion smashing Bose over extra cover.         
	He reached 29 in no time before off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri (1/23) accounted for him.         
	The senior of the Pathans miscued a flighted one from Sourashish and his lofted shot was deposited safely to Bose at long-off.         
	Yusufs movement, in fact, had been hampered as he had earlier pulled a hamstring while trying a slog sweep off Saurasish.         
	One expected bowlers to go for the kill in fading light and overcast conditions but credit should be given to Irfan and Pinal for leading an impressive fightback.

            EPL 2009-10 THE TEAMS TO WATCH OUT FOR AND THE TEAMS THAT NEED TO BE WATCHED                                  
	Theres a sense of dj vu as the English Premier League gets ready for kick-off on Saturday. In 2003, after David Beckham, the EPL star with the highest recall value, left for Real Madrid, the cynics sneered that the money-spinning and highly successful league will lose its sheen.         
	But then one Cristiano Ronaldo arrived at Old Trafford. After taking his time to settle down under the tutelage of Alex Ferguson, the Portuguese soared and along with him United and the league.         
	 Now in 2009, the EPL faces a similar threat. Cristiano has left for Real Madrid and the league is searching for a star. A player who can delight us with his skill, a player who can be a showman like the Portuguese.         
	 There are quite a few of them - Carlos Tevez, Emmanuel Adebayor, Wayne Rooney and Fernando Torres are stars in their own right. But can they be a brand like Ronaldo? Do they have the ability to carry their teams?         
	Only time will tell.         
	 While Ronaldo was developing into the player he is at present and United were in the process of rebuilding, Chelsea made the most of it.         
	 The 2004-05 and 2005-06 EPL champions are once again fancying their chances. So are Liverpool and the young gunners of Arsene Wenger. What adds spice to this         
	years contest is the oil-money driven splurge of Manchester City. Flush with funds from the Gulf, City have assembled an expensive outfit. Tevez, Adebayor, Kolo Toure, Roque Santa Cruz, you name it, they have it. Will they be able to challenge the big four? That too remains to be seen. However the league plays out, all these stars put together are sure to kick up a storm.

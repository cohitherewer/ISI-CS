The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Argentina aim for a turnaround 
                                                   Argentina aim for a turnaround 
                      
	Montevideo: Its getting close to crunch time for Argentina approaching the final straight of Latin Americas long slog of 2010 World Cup qualifying.         
	A 6-1 mauling in their last outing at high altitude in Bolivia in April was the albicelestes worst loss in six decades and heaped acute embarrassment on coach Diego Maradona, whose side have to seek redemption Saturday at home to Colombia.         
	Argentina currently occupy the last of the four guaranteed qualifying slots for the finals in South Africa with 19 points from 12 games  five adrift of Paraguay, two behind eternal rivals Brazil and one shy of Chiles 20.         
	With Uruguay breathing down their necks on 17 points the Argentines just cannot afford to slip up against a Colombia.

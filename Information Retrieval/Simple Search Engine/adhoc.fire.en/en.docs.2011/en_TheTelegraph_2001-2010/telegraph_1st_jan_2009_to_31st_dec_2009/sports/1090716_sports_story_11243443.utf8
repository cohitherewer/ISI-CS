The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis denies rift in the team
                                                     Younis denies rift in the team
                  Younis Khan                     
	Karachi: Pakistan captain Younis Khan has dismissed claims of groupism in the team, which former players believed led to Pakistans defeat in the Test series in Sri Lanka.         
	Ex-chief selector Abdul Qadir claimed on Wednesday that the present Pakistan side was divided in two rival camps led by former captain Shoaib Malik and his successor Younis and that was the reason for the teams debacle in Sri Lanka.         
	 Malik has not co-operated with Younis. I would say even if we have to drop most of the senior players to get rid of the internal politics within the team, it is not a costly bargain because in the end it is Pakistan cricket that is suffering, a furious Qadir said. Earlier, former captain Inzamam-ul Haq had also attributed the teams struggle in Sri Lanka to internal problems.         
	Qadir added that it was because some players were not being picked on pure merit that the team suffered defeats in the two Tests in Sri Lanka. I dont understand the logic behind not playing two of your most experienced bowlers, Danish Kaneria and Abdul Razzaq, in the Tests and instead opting to play with three debutant bowlers, Qadir said.         
	Reacting on the issue Younis said: The impression about differences in the team are not right. We lost the Tests because of poor batting. It is just that our batting didnt click when required the most and I think lack of Test exposure in recent months is the real reason for this, Younis said.         
	Younis said that it would be unfair chopping and changing players following the defeat.         
	I cant drop four or five players in one go. From where will I get their replacements. But yes, it is a fact that if senior players including myself dont perform, then we will not be able to retain our places for long, Younis added.         
	If I drop my vice-captain Misbah-ul Haq, people will say look Younis has done injustice with Misbah. If I drop Shoaib Malik people will say I have done this to settle some old score.         
	Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ejaz Butt has also rubbished reports of division within the Pakistan team.         
	There is no chance of any groupings within the team as captain Younis Khan has good relations with the other players, Butt said. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Was trying to save finger: Younis
                                                     Was trying to save finger: Younis
            A CORRESPONDENT            Younis Khan after his dismissal on Saturday                           
	Pakistan captain Younis Khan accepted on Saturday that he would have taken the simple catch offered by Grant Elliott in the semi-final against New Zealand, but for his fractured finger.         
	Younis dropped the catch when the batsman was on 42 in the 40th over, and that eventually turned out to be the turning point of the match.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	The dropped catch         
	Actually it was very crucial. It was a simple one but I just dropped it. Maybe after that catch, things wouldve changed. Its the broken finger more than anything. I was trying to save the finger.         
	If he was worried about         
	When I played with a broken finger they thought I won matches In previous matches I got a run-out and a good catch and people praised it, saying he is doing it with a broken finger. Today we made some mistakes and lost and paid for it So, I am not worried just about dropping the catch.         
	The disappointment         
	If we had got through then there would be one more match to win. It wouldve been good to be in the top two instead of top four, but out of eight teams we are in the top four That is good.         
	If it was the batting that let the team down         
	Yeah Especially in power play, we didnt score again. A couple of good starts but we didnt cash in Akmal and Yousuf had a good partnership but couldnt cash in. If they had stayed till the power play may be we couldve got 250-260.         
	Too many no balls         
	Because we lost, all these things are being talked about no-balls, power plays everyone has seen it. In pressure situations, your foot goes forward a bit. The coach has spoken about it, but maybe we couldnt handle the pressure.         
	If Pakistan underestimated NZ         
	No, never. We were underestimated as well.         
	The umpiring         
	I will not say anything about umpiring You have to be a bit lucky in semis and final If I had taken that catch, a few decisions, may be We were a little unlucky, a run out, a catch which I dropped, a decision.         
	The final         
	New Zealand cannot be taken lightly and that is why they are in the final. Should be a good final as bothteams are well balanced.         
	Overall progress         
	It has been a good experience for us. We finished in the top four and it has always been a nice thing to finish in the top four. After that you need some luck. We didnt get any and so we lost. But overall, after a long time we looked like a team and we fought as a team. We lost because we didnt bat well in the power plays and didnt bowl well. But, overall, we looked good.         
	The youngsters         
	Three guys  Mohammed Aamer, Umar Akmal, Saeed Ajmal. They showed maturity... If your youngsters are performing, well, then the future is bright.

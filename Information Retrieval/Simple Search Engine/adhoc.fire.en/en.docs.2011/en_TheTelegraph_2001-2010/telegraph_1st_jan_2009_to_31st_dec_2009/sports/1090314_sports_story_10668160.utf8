The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Md. Sporting take on desperate Vasco
                                                     Md. Sporting take on desperate Vasco
                  Okoro                     
	Panaji: Vasco will be desperate for a win against Mohammedan Sporting when they take on the Calcutta club in their crucial 19th round I-League encounter Saturday at the Nehru Stadium, Margao.         
	Vasco, with 10 points from 18 matches are on the brink of relegation at the bottom of the table and need a win against Mohammedan Sporting who are six points ahead of them.         
	Agostinho Dias took over from Elvis Goes in a bid to change Vascos fortune but defeat against Mumbai FC in the last match pushed them further towards the drop.         
	Its a match we should have won as we created ample scoring chances, which our strikers missed leading to our defeat, said a dejected Dias. Now we have no choice but to win all our remaining matches to keep alive hopes of avoiding relegation, Dias said.         
	Defender Vincent Pires will not play Saturday on account of a double booking while central defender Cowan Lawrence, who is nursing an injury, is a doubtful starter. The return of striker Ravshan Tashabaev will boost Vascos attack while the midfield will be in full strength with the return of Leister Fernandes.         
	Mohammedan Sporting, who too are fighting relegation, will rely on striker Mike Okoro for the goals. Eugene Gray and Adewusi Adebayo, the two foreigners, will assist him in the middle of the park.         
	Its a crucial match and we will go all out for a win to keep ourselves away from relegation, said Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali.           (PTI)

            A STAFF REPORTER            Joshimar                           
	Calcutta: Chirag United ran roughshod over a hapless Peerless SC to win 4-1 in a CFL Premier Division match at the Mohun Bagan ground, here on Saturday. Joshimar scored a brace (first and 78th), while Eduardo Chachon (11th) and Parveen Kumar (87th) netted once each for the winners. Ashim Das pulled one back in the 30th minute from a penalty. It was Chirags third win on the trot.         
	Chirag on the day did not have to press much harder to lot full points. They shot into the lead as early as in the first minute when defender Arnab Mondals speculative punt found an unmarked Joshimar inside the opponent half.         
	Peerless goalkeeper Prasenjit Debnath had no business in rushing out and the Brazilian forwards lob went past the goalkeeper and nestled into the net.

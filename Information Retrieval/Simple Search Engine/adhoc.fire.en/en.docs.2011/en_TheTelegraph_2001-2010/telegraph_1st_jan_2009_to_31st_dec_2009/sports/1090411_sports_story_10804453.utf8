                                                     Theres a lot left to achieve: Gambhir
                  Gautam Gambhir                     
	New Delhi: Gautam Gambhir may have come of age during the tour to New Zealand with an awesome batting display, but the diminutive opener is not willing to be distracted by his new-found stardom, saying he still had a lot more to achieve.         
	The 27-year-old Delhi batsman said he was still working on his flaws and it was a constant process to evolve.         
	You can never be stagnant. You have to keep moving. There is so much more to achieve. You have to keep working on your game for your progress and move ahead, he said here Saturday.         
	I dont know if I have really come of age as far as my game is concerned but its been really satisfying to do well overseas, he said.         
	It was a very satisfying tour because I always wanted to do well abroad. I am very happy that I could do that, he said.         
	Gambhir top-scored with 445 runs in the three-Test series to average a whopping 89 as India won the series 1-0.         
	Reacting to his Delhi teammate and fellow opener Virender Sehwags compliment that he was the best opener after the legendary Sunil Gavaskar, Gambhir said he was indeed happy to know that.         
	I dont believe in comparisons. But coming from my favourite player, it means a lot to me. Sehwag is such a big player and that he feels so, makes me really happy. He is one player I have always looked up to. If ever I want to sacrifise my wicket for anyone, that would be Sehwag, Gambhir said.         
	Gambhir rated his century in Napier as one of his best efforts on the 45-day long tour.         
	My 137 runs in the Napier Test was my best innings. It is really very special to me, said Gambhir, who was described as the second wall of Indian cricket by stand-in captain Sehwag after that knock.         
	Gambhir, however, said he had no personal goals to achieve but the one thing that occupies his mind is the success of team.         
	I dont set any individual targets. For me, its only team goals. I want to do whatever will make my team win. It is always a team effort and a team goal, which matters to me. I dont play for individual achievements, I dont plan for any personal milestones, he said.         
	Gambhir, who exhibited a fine blend of patience and aggression in his batting to adjust to the teams needs, revealed that pacing the innings came naturally to him.         
	It comes very naturally to me. As a professional player, I should be able to adjust myself to any situation as per the need of the game. There is no excuse for not performing for the team. I have to play as per the need of the team, Gambhir said.         
	He, however, refused to give credit to anyone for his outstanding success.         
	I dont know how big a role anyone has played in my success but in a team, everyone plays a particular role for the success and that translates into a win, he said.         
	Gambhir also supported India captain Mahendra Singh Dhonis decision of declaring late in the third and final Test which drew a lot of criticism.         
	I think it was absolutely fine. It was a collective decision by the team and I fully back Dhoni in his decision about the timing of declaration, he said.         
	Gambhir also dismissed suggestions that Dhoni was more lucky than skilful.         
	Its all rubbish. Dhoni has a very good cricket brain. Theres no question about it, he reamrked.         
	Asked if he idolised any cricketer, Gambhir said: Sehwag is my favourite player but I dont have any cricketer as my idol. If you ask, I idolise shahid Bhagat Singh, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand rises to tied 3rd after draw with Cuban 
                                                     Anand rises to tied 3rd after draw with Cuban

	Linares: World champion Viswanathan Anand played out another draw with Cuban Lenier Dominguez, but the other results of Tuesday helped him figure joint third after the 10th round of the Magistral Ciudad de Linares chess tournament here.         
	Anand, after the fourth consecutive draw in the tournament, which is a part of Grand Slam of Chess, took his tally to five points out of a possible 10 and with just four rounds remaining, only a great finish can propel him to the top of the tally.         
	Overnight sole leader Alexander Grischuk of Russia ensured his stay on the top with 6.5 points after a hard-fought draw with Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine, who now stands sole second.         
	Anand shares the third spot with Armenian Levon Aronian and Magnus Carlsen of Norway on 5 points while Radjabov and Wang Yue are now joint sixth on 4.5 points, a half point clear of tail-ender Dominguez.         
	Anand went for the sharp Russian system against Dominguez but the Cuban kept his cool in complications. By pushing his central pawn to the sixth rank, Anand tried to make headway along the central files but again Dominguez stayed in the game with effective maneuvers.         
	The exchange of pieces ensued and the queens got traded on the 26th move. Nine moves later the draw was agreed to in a balanced endgame.         
	During the day, Carlsen found his nemesis in Wang Yue of China, Aronian was also on the receiving end against Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan.         
	Carlsen suffered his second loss against Wang Yue in about a month when the Chinese proved superior with black pieces.         
	The Slav defence by Wang resulted in an active position and the latter was at his technical best in posing maximum problems for Carlsen.         
	In the late stages of middle game Carlsen won an exchange but his king went for a long ride with threats of checkmate looming large.           (PTI)

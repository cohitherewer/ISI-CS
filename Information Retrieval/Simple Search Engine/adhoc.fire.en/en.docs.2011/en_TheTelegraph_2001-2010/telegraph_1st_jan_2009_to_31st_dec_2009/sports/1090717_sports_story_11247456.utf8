                                                   New role for Vece Paes at the CAB
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Dr Vece Paes will renew his association with Bengal cricket this season.         
	As part of the high performance programme of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), Dr Paes will be in charge of the Ranji Trophy team besides working with the junior sides and the boys at its proposed academy at Kalyani.         
	Preliminary discussions have already taken place with CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya but the modalities are yet to be worked out.         
	Back in 2001, Dr Paes was involved with the Bengal team as fitness consultant for two years. His association with the Asian Cricket Council as a sports medicine and fitness consultant expired in May after eight years.         
	Its going to be a long-term deal and will involve a larger area of work. Im very excited about the new assignment and would love to work with the players. The exact brief will be known shortly. It will also depend on the time I can devote, Dr Paes told The Telegraph on Thursday.         
	His responsibilities in the Asian body were manifold and involved extensive travelling across 18 member countries.         
	The job profile included preparing a fitness manual for the coaches working in the non-Test playing Asian countries.         
	Bengal have already roped in Roger Binny as coach for the ensuing season.

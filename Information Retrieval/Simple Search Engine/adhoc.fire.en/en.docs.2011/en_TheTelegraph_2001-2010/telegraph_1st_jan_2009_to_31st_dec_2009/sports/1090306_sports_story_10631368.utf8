            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: East Bengal will be looking to overcome the absence of key players and put it across Mahindra United at the Cooperage, here on Friday.         
	The Calcutta club seemed to have got their fortunes back on track after a disastrous I-League first leg when they drubbed arch rivals Mohun Bagan last month. But they were brought back to earth by Mohammedan Sporting, who led 2-0 before Subhas Bhowmicks men pulled up their socks and bounced back to split points.         
	Subhas knows that there would be no room for such a fightback against Mahindra United who were scrappy, yet good enough to beat Vasco SC 4-0 in their last match.         
	It was a morale boosting draw, Subhas told reporters ahead of the teams practice session on the eve of the 18th round clash.         
	The visitors will be without veteran Yusif Yakubu (double booking), Ashim Biswas and Ismael Addo (both injured). Yakubus absence is a big setback, Subhas conceded. In the absence of the 34-year-old Ghanaian, the responsibility could fall on the likes of Parveen Kumar, the coach added.         
	I had my task cut out, Subhas said. The team was in a shambles, there were injuries. I didnt even have a proper team for the Mumbai FC match. Now its much better.         
	So, nothing but a win would satisfy him ? At least a point (draw). The relegation threat is a thing of the past. So the motivation is to go up the table as much as possible.

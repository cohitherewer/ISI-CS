	London: Chelsea stayed at the top of the Premier League on Saturday by outplaying Bolton Wanderers 4-0, and Arsenal beat Tottenham Hotspurs 3-0 before Liverpool had two players sent off in a 3-1 loss at Fulham.         
	Frank Lampard, Deco and Didier Drogba scored a goal each for Chelsea, while Bolton defender Zat Knight put in an own-goal. Bolton finished the match with 10 men.         
	Robin van Persie scored twice and Cesc Fabregas added the other in Arsenals win at the Emirates Stadium.         
	The Gunners scored two quick goals just before halftime against their north London rivals and now have 22 points, five fewer than Chelsea with a game in hand.         
	On a day with a record eight red cards in the Premier League, two went to Liverpool as the Reds lost for the fifth time in 11 league matches.         
	After Bobby Zamora had given Fulham a 24th-minute lead, Fernando Torres equalised from 25 metres with his 10th goal of the season.         
	Erik Nevland then made it 2-1 in the 73rd, Torres was soon taken off and Philipp Degen and Jamie Carragher were sent off before Clint Dempsey added a third for Fulham.         
	Im very disappointed because I felt we were controlling the game, Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez said.         
	It was a one-sided game with plenty of possession and we conceded a goal by making one mistake.         
	Then we made a massive mistake with the second goal and the first red card (Degen) was a surprise for me.         
	I thought it was only a yellow card. These two incidents at the end changed everything.         
	Aruna Dindane scored his first three goals of the season as last-place Portsmouth beat Wigan 4-0 for their first home victory.         
	Portsmouth stayed last but was level on points with West Ham, which drew 2-2 at Sunderland in a game where a player from each side was red-carded.         
	After Guillermo Franco and Carlton Cole had given West Ham a two-goal lead inside the first 36 minutes, Andy Reid pulled a goal back with a free kick and Kieran Richardson equalised in the 76th.         
	Sunderland striker Kenwyne Jones was sent off for pushing West Hams Herita Ilunga in the face and the visitors Radoslav Kovac received two yellows.         
	Two players were sent off as Everton and Aston Villa drew 1-1, Villa substitute John Carew equalising within 44 seconds of taking the field after Dinyar Bilyaledtinov had scored for the home side.         
	In the closing stages, the Russian was sent off for a late tackle and Carlos Cuellar was ordered off for his second yellow card.         
	Burnley beat 10-man Hull 2-0 with a penalty and a 25-meter shot from Graham Alexander to keep the pressure on the visiting manager, Phil Brown. Hull had Geovanni sent off for two yellow cards.         
	Stoke surrendered a two-goal lead and was held 2-2 at home by Wolves.         
	An own goal by George Ekokobi and Matthew Etheringtons strike a minute before halftime put Stoke in control at the Britannia Stadium.         
	But Jody Craddock scored twice in the second half to earn a point for the Wolves.           (AP)

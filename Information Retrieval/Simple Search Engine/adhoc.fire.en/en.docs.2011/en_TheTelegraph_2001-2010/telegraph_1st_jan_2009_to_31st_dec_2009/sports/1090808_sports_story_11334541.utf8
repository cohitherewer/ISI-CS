	 Butt wants one-on-one with players
    
	Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ejaz Butt wants to talk to players individually on reports of discord within the team and that some players are not co-operating with captain Younis Khan in Sri Lanka.  
	A PCB official said Friday that Butt will meet the players in Karachi and Lahore on August 14 and 15 besides asking the captain, coach and manager of the team to file separate reports on the Test and ODI debacles in the island nation.         
	The chairman wants to have a look at what the captain, coach and manager think were the reasons for the teams poor performance in Sri Lanka. Plus he is also keen to have one-to-ones with the players, said the official, who did not want to be named.         
	Tanvir upset         
	 Karachi: Pakistan fast bowler Sohail Tanvir was disappointed after his much-touted deal with Surrey failed to materialise apparently due to visa problems. Yes, I didnt get the required work permit and visa on time so the contract has fallen through. It is very disappointing to me, Tanvir said.         
	CA nominees         
	 Melbourne: Rodney Tucker, Bruce Oxenford and Paul Reiffel were Friday retained as Cricket Australias nominees for the ICC International Umpires Panel for 2009-10. Steve Davis, Daryl Harper and Simon Taufel remain on the ICC Elite Panel, contracted directly to the governing body.         
	KKR camp         
	 Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders will have a pre-season training camp at the Eden Gardens next week.

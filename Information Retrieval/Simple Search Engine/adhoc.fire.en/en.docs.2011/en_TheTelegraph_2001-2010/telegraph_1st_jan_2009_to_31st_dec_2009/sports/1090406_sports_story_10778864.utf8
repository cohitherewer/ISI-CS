The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Black Caps coach gives up hope
                                                   Black Caps coach gives up hope
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Wellington: New Zealand coach Andy Moles admitted after the third days play on Sunday that a New Zealand victory is unlikely and they will have to bat really well in the second innings to escape with a draw.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On the days performance         
	We were a lot better today (Sunday). The wicket is a really good one to bat on and the guys (the Indians) played really well. The ball went past the edge a few times but the reality is that after a poor day yesterday, we have been playing catch up and we have got ourselves into a difficult situation.         
	If the bowlers are tired         
	Yes, they are tired. We need plenty of supplements to get them through till the end.         
	What will be New Zealands aim when they come out to bat in the second innings?         
	Well, history suggests there are not too many sides who have won from this situation. One of the things that I told the guys when I first started against the West Indies is that youve got to learn how to draw a Test match. Certainly, this ones shaping into a battle to save the match. Whenever we get the opportunity to bat, we should bat really well. The players know that they havent played well in the first innings. Theyll have the opportunity to go out there and get some big scores. They are looking forward to that opportunity.         
	On Brendon McCullums stunning catch to dismiss Rahul Dravid         
	It wasnt planned. Id love to say that we had worked on that. That wouldve sounded good. It was some real good improvisation by Baz. I think he saw the shot two or three times before and he just backed his instinct. He is innovative in the way he plays his cricket. It was a wonderful piece of judgement from him.

    - Nabi, Sunil score in 3-0 thrashing Bhaichung to miss crucial Churchill tie             ANSHUMAN ROY                            
	Calcutta: Even before the final whistle, East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick was out of the dugout. As he started walking towards the tunnel, he suddenly stopped and gestured the celebrating fans to cheer his team on. The crowd obliged and Bhowmick walked down the tunnel in his inimitable style. The job is done; the wheel has turned around after almost two years! The monotony is finally broken; the ghost is dead and buried for good.         
	Under the glare of the Salt Lake Stadium, watched by over 90,000 spectators, East Bengal outpaced, out-thought and outclassed Mohun Bagan 3-0 in a 16th round I-League match on Sunday. Syed Rahim Nabi scored a brace before half-time and Sunil Chetri netted the other two minutes into the second half.         
	For those with a penchant for history, it was the red and gold brigades first win against their archrivals at the Salt Lake Stadium since April 15, 2007. It was also Mohun Bagans first defeat in the ongoing league after a 10-match winning streak.         
	The loss cost them their place at the top of the heap with Sporting Clube de Goa replacing them. Whether this humiliating loss will deal a debilitating blow to the title-surge remains to be seen. The fact that Karim Bencharifa will be missing Bhaichung Bhutia  who will sit out due to double booking  against Churchill Brothers complicates matters more. How quickly things change, isnt it?         
	For that Bhowmick should take the bow. When he took over the reins after the Federation Cup, confidence was at its lowest ebb. After the initial hiccups, things started to change for the better. Two convincing victories made them believe that they could turn the tables on Bagan. As Bhowmick said on the eve of the match, in football, as in life, nothing is impossible.         
	And that egged on his boys. So, we saw supremely confident M. Suresh and Mehrajuddin Wadoo keeping the likes of Bhutia and Jose Ramirez Barreto silent. We saw Rennedy Singhs deliveries creating havoc in the Bagan defence, Ismael Addo, not shackled by the pain, hassling Marcos, Sunil Chetri making amends for that Fed Cup blemish, Yusif Yakubu taunting and tormenting his markers.         
	But one player outshone them all on the day and ran away with the accolades. Syed Rahim Nabi has this knack of hogging the limelight under the noses of the big guns. He has limited talent but makes up for it with loads of guts and a never-say-die attitude. Sunday was no different. Manning the right side of midfield, Nabi was at his blazing best. He scored two fantastic headers off Rennedy Singh deliveries to seal it for East Bengal.         
	The first one came in the 22nd minute. Rennedys corner and up went Nabi. His marker Rakesh Masih was beaten hands down and Nabis header tore into the near corner.         
	The second one came in the 40th minute. Rennedy once again, this time from a free- kick and Nabis powerful header just did not have any answer from defender Peter Odafe and keeper Sangram Mukherjee. Nabi had a hand in the third also. Surkumar Singh put him on the run; his blindside surge and the measured low cross took the rival defence by surprise. Chetri did the rest without any fuss.         
	When Bhowmick announced on Saturday that Nabi would play as right-half, it did take a lot of people by surprise. What they forgot was the simple fact that Nabi is most dangerous when he has Surkumar Singh to complement him on the flanks. It wasnt a masterstroke from Bhowmick, as some might think. He was just going by the book. Such was their domination on the flanks that Ishfaq Ahmed and Deepak Mondal looked all at sea..         
	And for East Bengal fans it was party time. The flares in the stands and the unbridled euphoria might give the uninitiated the impression that East Bengal have won the title, but a victory against the title-chasers after almost two years is a good enough reason to be delirious. Even the most ardent Bagan fan wont disagree.

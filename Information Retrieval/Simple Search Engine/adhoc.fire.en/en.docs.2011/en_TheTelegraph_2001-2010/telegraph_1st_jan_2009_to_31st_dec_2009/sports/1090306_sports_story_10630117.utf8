The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ECB could pull players out of IPL
                                                   ECB could pull players out of IPL
            Derek Pringle                            
	The pair, both valued at $1.5 million, are due to play in the IPL for three weeks in April along with three other ECB-contracted players, Owais Shah, Ravi Bopara and Paul Collingwood. Two other England qualified players, Dimitri Mascarenhas and Graham Napier, are also due to play in the tournament which runs from April 10 to May 24.         
	It is the IPL franchises that have the duty of care to players so they will be the ones who will need to put the safety and security provisions in place, Hugh Morris, managing director of ECB, said on Wednesday. But we have a right over our contracted players and we will need to make sure that safety and security provisions are in place, just as the health and fitness provisions are in place at each of the franchises as well.         
	Morris, who is a close friend of Paul Fabrace, Sri Lankas English assistant coach who suffered shrapnel wounds in the Lahore attack, said that security for India was paramount and would be monitored on a daily basis.         
	Safety and security is always a concern for us  its the No. 1 priority of our boards as we demonstrated when we returned to India before Christmas, Morris said. But everybody is vulnerable and nobody can guarantee 100 per cent security.         
	That chilling assessment is clearly shared by some of the players involved in this years IPL.         
	But the money involved in IPL means that most players are unlikely to withdraw voluntarily and Collingwood, signed to the Delhi DareDevils for $250,000, admitted that he would play a waiting game.         
	From my personal point of view, I have a Test match to concentrate on for the next few days and once that is over I will be in a better position to look at this all a bit more clearly, Collingwood said.         
	My priority at the moment is to win a Test match in Trinidad, but I have always felt safe in India when Ive played there and it is important to recognise that this is a different country to Pakistan.         
	Of course when something as tragic as this happens, thoughts do cross your mind and you do question things a bit because weve all been in similar situations travelling to and from games like that. But the right thing to do is to wait and see how things go from here.

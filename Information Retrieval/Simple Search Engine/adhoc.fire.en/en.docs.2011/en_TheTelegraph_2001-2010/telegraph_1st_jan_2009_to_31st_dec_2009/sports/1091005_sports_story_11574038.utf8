The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ECB drops day-night Test plan
                                                   ECB drops day-night Test plan
                      
	London: The England and Wales Cricket Boards (ECBs) proposed first day-night Test match between England and Bangladesh was nipped in the bud after two counties refused to try the pink ball in their four-day Championship final round match.         
	The ECB had proposed to host the first floodlit Test match in May next year but without a successful trial the International Cricket Council would refuse to sanction such a change.         
	It needs a proper series of trials and that cannot now be done in time. Playing a Test in anything but white clothing is also an issue, ECB chairman Giles Clarke was quoted as saying in a British daily.         
	Durham and Worcestershire were the two country sides who were asked to test the pink ball in their four-day match at New Road but both the teams refused to play with such a ball.         
	I was not keen. It was a first-class match and I thought we should retain the games integrity, Durham coach Geoff Cook said.         
	Marylebone Cricket Clubs (MCCs) assistant secretary John Stephenson said it was important to find the right kind of ball and try it properly before thinking of a day-night Test.

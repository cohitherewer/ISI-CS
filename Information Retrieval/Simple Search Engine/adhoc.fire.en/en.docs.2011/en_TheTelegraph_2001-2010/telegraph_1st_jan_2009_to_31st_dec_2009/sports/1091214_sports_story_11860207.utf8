The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Waqar Younis may replace Intikhab
                                                                                                                       7                                      Waqar Younis may replace Intikhab
                      
	Karachi: Bowling and fielding coach Waqar Younis may replace Intikhab Alam as the chief coach of Pakistan, given his popularity among the present bunch of players.         
	A source in the PCB said that the move to bring in former captain Waqar is part of a long-term thinking of some PCB officials.         
	It makes no sense to bring in Waqar at this point of time for the Australian tour unless some long-term thinking was not involved. Apparently, Ijaz Butt is looking at Waqar as a long-term candidate for the post of chief coach, and the days of Intikhab Alam might be numbered, the source added.         
	The source also said that Waqar is very popular among the present bunch of players, who have a lot of respect for him.         
	He also said that Waqar could end up drawing fatter perk and bonuses than Intikhab, if the team and the bowlers do well during his tenure.           (PTI)

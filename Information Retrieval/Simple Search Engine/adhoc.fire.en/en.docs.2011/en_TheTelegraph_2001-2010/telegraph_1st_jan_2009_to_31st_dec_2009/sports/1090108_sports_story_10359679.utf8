The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania goes down to Chakvetadze
                                                   Sania goes down to Chakvetadze
                      
	Hong Kong: Sania Mirza, making a comeback from a wrist injury, went down fighting against her nemesis Ana Chakvetadze, resulting in Team Asia-Pacifics 0-2 defeat against Team Russia in the World Team Challenge meet on Wednesday.         
	All hopes of the Asian team making a comeback in the tie rested on Sania after Asia-Pacific captain Zheng Jie of China lost the first singles to her counterpart Vera Zvonareva.         
	The Indian ace fought well against the world No. 18 but could not help her team as Chakvetadze won 6-4, 6-4.         
	Earlier, Zvonareva beat Zheng 7-6 (7-3), 6-4, to give her team a 1-0 lead.         
	Both players were erratic, with the match including 13 breaks on serve.         
	The Russian, a bronze medallist at the Beijing Olympics, trailed in both sets, coming back from 3-5 down in the first to force a tie-break.         
	Zheng, an accomplished doubles player who made the Wimbledon singles semi-finals in 2008, missed four straight backhands as she lost the tie-break.         
	Zvonareva recovered from a 0-2 deficit in the second set, and two straight backhand errors by Zheng in the 10th game gave the Russian the break and the win.         
	The other team matchup will pit Team Europe against Team Americas.         
	World No.1 Jelena Jankovic of Serbia is captaining the European squad while seven-time Grand Slam singles champion American Venus Williams is leading the Americas team.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pandey, the hero
                                                   Pandey, the hero
            OUR BUREAU                      
	Man of the Match Manish Pandey repaid his captains trust with aplomb. The Nainital-born Pandey, hero of his sides victory over the Deccan Chargers on Thursday, was also one of the architects of the Royal Challengers Bangalores run-chase with 48 on Saturday.         
	Speaking after the match, the soft-spoken Manish said that the credit for him coming of age goes to captain Anil Kumble.               
	The following are excerpts               
	I have performed in the second match (after his unbeaten 114 Thursday). I am really happy. Thursday was good, and today, too. Anilbhai gave me the freedom and I played my natural game. Initially the wicket was a bit slow, the ball was stopping a bit but it changed later on. I didnt want to give Murali (Muttiah Muralidharan) my wicket. I just wanted to rotate the strike with Rahulbhai.         
	 The final, in Johannesburg, will begin at 2000 hours (IST).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI to remove tainted official
                                                   BCCI to remove tainted official
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Bangalore: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will be removing V. Chamundeshwarnath from its high-profile marketing committee. Any further action would depend on the communication from the Andhra Cricket Association (ACA).         
	On Thursday, the ACA sacked Chamundeshwarnath, its secretary, whod been the Team India manager in the recent World T20. He got the boot for acts of grave misconduct.         
	As theres no working committee meeting between now and the AGM (September 24, in Mumbai), Chamundeshwarnath can only be removed when everybody gets together for the annual meeting, a top BCCI official told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Friday, he added: Any action beyond that would depend on the communication sent to us by the ACA... Of course, the BCCI has been severely embarrassed by Chamundeswarnaths conduct.         
	Meanwhile, one learns that Assams Dr Brojen Gohain will be the manager on the very short trip to Sri Lanka next month, while Himachals Anurag Thakur will be wearing that hat in the (September 22-October 5) Champions Trophy in South Africa.         
	No sign yet, then, of appointing a professional manager.

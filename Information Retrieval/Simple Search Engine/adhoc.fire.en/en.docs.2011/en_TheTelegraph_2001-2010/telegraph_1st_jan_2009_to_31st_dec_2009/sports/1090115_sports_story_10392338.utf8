                                                   Hayden among all-time greats
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Matthew Hayden, just retired from representative cricket, can look back on his international career that puts him in the top-10 Test batsmen and top-20 one day International (ODI) batsmen of all-time.         
	Haydens highest Test rating of 935 came during the Ashes series of 2002-03 and puts him level in 10th position with South Africas Jacques Kallis and just behind four others  Sri Lankas Kumar Sangakkara and a West Indian triumvirate consisting of legends Clive Walcott, Viv Richards and Garry Sobers.         
	Haydens one-day performances put him 18th in the all-time ICC Player Rankings for ODI batsmen with a career-high rating of 854 points, a tally that puts him level with New Zealands Glenn Turner and just behind Sri Lankas Aravinda de Silva.         
	Only 25 batsmen in the history of the game have amassed 900 rating points or more in Test cricket while just 20 have passed the 850-point mark in ODIs.         
	Haydens achievements in the game are remarkable. In 103 Tests he scored 8,625 runs at an average of 50.73, including 30 centuries and 29 fifties.         
	His highest score of 380 against Zimbabwe at the WACA in 2003 was a world record at the time and at his best he was an impossibly aggressive and mentally strong player who loved to dominate bowling through brute force.

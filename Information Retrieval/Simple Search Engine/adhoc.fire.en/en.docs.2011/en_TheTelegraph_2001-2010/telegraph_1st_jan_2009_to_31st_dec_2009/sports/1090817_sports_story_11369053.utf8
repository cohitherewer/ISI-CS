The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Andy new No.2; Mark, Mahesh win crown
                                                     Andy new No.2; Mark, Mahesh win crown
                  Andy Murray                     
	Montreal: Andy Murray prized the world No. 2 ranking from Rafael Nadal by beating Jo Wilfried-Tsonga 6-4, 7-6 to book a final clash with in-form Argentine Juan Martin del Potro at the Montreal Masters on Saturday.         
	Playing his first tournament since losing in the Wimbledon semi-finals, the 22-year-old Scotsman has barely put a foot wrong in Montreal, advancing to his sixth final of the season without dropping a set.         
	Murray will have his hands full against Del Potro, however, the Argentine entering his first Masters Series final on the back of a 10-match winning streak after coming from behind to vanquish fifth-seeded American Andy Roddick 4-6, 6-2, 7-5 in the semi-finals.         
	Meanwhile, Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles beat Max Mirnyi (Belarus) and Andy Ram (Israel) 6-4, 6-3 in the doubles final on Sunday.         
	It was Bhupathis 45th title. It was also the duos first success of the year.         
	The final was a relatively an easy match for the indo-Bahamian combination, compared to the semifinal in which they were taken to a match tie-breaker by defending champions Daniel Nestor of Canada and Serbias Nenad Zimonjic. Bhupathi and Knowles had triumphed 5-7, 6-2, 10-4 late on Saturday night.         
	The semifinal defeat will see Nestor and Zimonjic slip to No 2 in ATP doubles team rankings when the new list is issued on Monday, while the Bryan twins will be back at the top.         
	The Bryans were beaten 6-7 (5-7), 2-6 by Ram and Mirnyi in their semifinal.         
	Murrays win over Tsonga made him the highest-ranked British man since the ATP rankings began in 1973, and also broke the stranglehold Nadal and Swiss rival Roger Federer have held over the top two spots since July 2005.         
	Both Federer and Nadal had lost their quarter final matches on Friday. While Tsonga grappled to a 7-6 (7-5), 1-6, 7-6 (7-3) victory over Federer, defending champion Nadal was humbled by Del Potro 7-6 (7-5), 6-1.         
	While Murray might have expected a semi-final date with Federer, it was the imposing frame of Tsonga greeting him from the other end of the court, the Frenchman having handed the Swiss a shock defeat despite trailing 1-5 in the deciding set of their quarter-final.         
	Tsonga was again in fight-back mode on Saturday, and after conceding an early break to trail 3-1 in the first set, broke back to serve at 5-4 down.         
	But a feisty Murray immediately hit back with another break to claim the opening set.         
	With neither player able to stamp their authority on the second, the set came down to a thrilling back-and-forth tie-break with Murray finally prevailing 10-8 after Tsonga netted a service return.         
	Del Potro has had Roddicks number in both their previous meetings, including last Sundays final at the Washington Classic, but it was the fifth-seeded American who gained the upper hand early, clinching the opening set with ease.         
	Del Potro, who fired 19 aces, maintained the intensity in the tight deciding set, and broke Roddicks serve at 5-5, prompting the American to smash his racquet to pieces in frustration and surrender the match shortly after.

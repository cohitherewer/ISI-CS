The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Terry will stay: Drogba
                                                   Terry will stay: Drogba
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Didier Drogba is confident John Terry will turn down Manchester Citys overtures and stay at Stamford Bridge.         
	Drogba scored Chelseas first goal in their 2-0 pre-season win over Inter Milan. The Blues dominated former boss Jose Mourinhos side in front of 81,224 fans at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena on Wednesday.         
	And as Terry played the full 90 minutes for new head coach Carlo Ancelotti in California, despite Manchester Citys concerted effort to coax him to Eastlands, Drogba said the England captain was going nowhere.         
	Hes our captain and we need him and we know hes going to stay with us and win more trophies, Drogba said.         
	Of his side coming face to face with Mourinho, Drogba said: Its always nice to see him, he was a big part of Chelseas success and now were moving on.         
	We have a new manager now and were all happy for him because he won his second game out of two, so its all good. Were working hard and we want to be ready for the start of the season.         
	Goals from Drogba in the 11th minute and a Frank Lampard penalty just after half-time gave Chelsea the victory.

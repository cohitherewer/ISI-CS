                                                   Tough for Bhutias
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa believes his teams sudden slump in the I-League will influence their performance when they take on Al Karama of Syria in their group D opening encounter of the AFC Cup at the Khaled Ibn Al Waleed Stadium on Tuesday.         
	Mohun Bagan suffered consecutive losses against East Bengal and Churchill Brothers respectively and those two defeats have pushed them off the pedestal.         
	The defeats definitely affected the teams morale and made a lot of things difficult for us, forcing us to make compromises in our AFC Cup campaign, Bencharifa said from Hims. The Moroccan points to the teams long season since the Calcutta Football League (CFL) and feels his players are exhausted coming to the business end of the I-League.         
	We cant play some of our best players in the first two matches of the AFC Cup due to injury and exhaustion and will have to make some forced changes tomorrow (Tuesday), Bencharifa said. Our priority will be the I-League. We are just five points behind and a lot can happen. For the moment we need to keep things under control in the AFC Cup and, with the I-League getting over within a month, we can then turn our attention towards the continent, he added.         
	Bagan striker Jose Ramirez Barreto is recovering from a lower-back injury and has been rested for the match.         
	That means the green and maroon brigade will go in with only two imports  Brazilian midfielder Marcos Pereira and Nigerian defender Peter Odafe and Bhaichung Bhutia will also be there.         
	Al Karama, one of Syrias top clubs, have a rich history in the Asian context, but Bencharifa insisted they would give nothing away.         
	Yes, they are a very good side and have everything going their way and they are also physically intimidating, said Bencharifa. Our tallest player Odafe looks small compared to their three foreigners, the coach said in jest.

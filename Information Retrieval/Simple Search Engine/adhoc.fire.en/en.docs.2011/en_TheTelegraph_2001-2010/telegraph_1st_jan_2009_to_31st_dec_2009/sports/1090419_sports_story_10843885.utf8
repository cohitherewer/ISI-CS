                                                     Upsets on opening day set Knights thinking
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            McCullum: Acid test                           
	Cape Town: With the opening day of the Indian Premier League (IPL)s second edition producing stunning results, the Kolkata Knight Riders have put on hold finalising the XI for Sundays opener, against Deccan Chargers.         
	Both matches will be reviewed before a decision is taken... In any case, theres no hurry as our match is the days second, a member of the team management told The Telegraph on Saturday evening.         
	Whats more or less confirmed is that captain Brendon McCullum will open with Chris Gayle. Sourav Ganguly is set to bat at No. 3, followed by Brad Hodge.         
	As only four foreigners can be fielded, the fourth slot is likely to go to an allrounder  Moises Henriques or Angelo Matthews or even Morne van Wyk.         
	If Morne plays, then hell keep and not McCullum.         
	Laxmi Ratan Shukla should be at No.6, followed by five compatriots.         
	The match will, of course, see John Buchanans multiple leaders concept on view on the big stage.         
	Meanwhile, till late in the evening, there was no confirmation that Adam Gilchrist, who has replaced V.V.S. Laxman as captain, would indeed make the XI. Theres been a question mark over the past couple of days.         
	The Deccan Chargers coach too is new  former Australia batsman Darren Lehman. Speaking exclusively, he said: We arent looking back at what happened (finishing last) in the first season... Its time to look ahead...         
	Asked if the 11th-hour change at the top in the Knight Riders camp could have some bearing, Lehman replied: Not really... Its their internal thing which we dont need to focus on... Even weve had changes...         
	The Knight Riders principal owner, Shah Rukh Khan, has declared his team is the coolest-looking one. Now, the McCullums have to show they can be real hot as well, on the park.         
	Match starts: 8 pm (IST).

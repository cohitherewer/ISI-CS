The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Roger passes Soderling test
                                                     Roger passes Soderling test
  - Djokovic moves up; Error-prone Oudin bows out             Roger Federer after his win on Wednesday                           
	New York: The dazzling US Open run by American teenager Melanie Oudin ended abruptly on Wednesday in a hail of unforced errors, while Roger Federer was tested but marched into his 22nd consecutive Grand Slam semi-final.         
	Ninth-seeded Dane Caroline Wozniacki was steady, if unspectacular, in defeating the unseeded Oudin 6-2, 6-2 to reach the semi-finals of the years final Grand Slam.         
	Ive had a great run this tournament, said the 17-year-old Oudin. Im a perfectionist, so... losing isnt good enough for me. I was a little bit fragile.         
	Top seed Federer overcame an inspired comeback effort by Robin Soderling to beat the 25-year-old Swede 6-0, 6-3, 6-7, 7-6, winning the final-set tiebreaker 8-6.         
	It was so close towards the end, said Federer, who has beaten Soderling in all 12 career meetings, including at Wimbledon and the French Open this year.         
	Its a great relief to come through. He started to play better and better as the match went on. I knew he was going to be tough but the beginning was bit too easy.         
	All of sudden he found his way into the match.         
	In the semi-finals, the five-times defending champion will face fourth seed Novak Djokovic, who advanced with a 7-6, 1-6, 7-5, 6-2 victory over Spains Fernando Verdasco, the 10th seed. Elsewhere, Belgiums unseeded Yanina Wickmayer dispatched Ukraines Kateryna Bondarenko 7-5, 6-4 and set up a semi-final encounter with Wozniacki.         
	But the big news of the tenth day at Flushing Meadows was the quiet elimination of Oudin, the diminutive Georgian who failed to respond to the urging of the 23,000 fans at Arthur Ashe Stadium.         
	Oudin, who beat fourth seed Elena Dementieva and former champion Maria Sharapova en route to the quarter-finals, had 43 unforced errors during the 88-minute match against Wozniacki and only seven winners from her chief weapon, the forehand.         
	I started off slow, said Oudin, ranked number 70. I wasnt able to come back. Shes such a strong player. She doesnt give you anything for free. She plays incredible defence, makes me hit a thousand balls.           (REUTERS)

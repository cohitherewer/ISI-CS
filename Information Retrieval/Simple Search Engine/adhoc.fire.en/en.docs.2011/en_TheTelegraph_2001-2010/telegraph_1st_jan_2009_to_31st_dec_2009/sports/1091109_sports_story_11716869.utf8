The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sangakkara: We are under no pressure 
                                                                                                                                   Sangakkara: We are under no pressure 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara does not believe Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. would be vulnerable in the upcoming series, following the ODI series loss to Australia. Nevertheless, the 32-year-old argued, the hosts would be under pressure, notwithstanding Sri Lankas poor record on Indian soil.         
	It depends on how teams react to losses, some react positively while some dont, Sangakkara said after arriving in India with his team Sunday, for playing three Tests, five one-dayers and two Twenty20s.         
	The pressure will probably be on India as it was during their series against Australia. For us, we are under no pressure. We know we havent won here, and for us, we need to try and change that. We are here to relax, enjoy and not worry about history, and try and put as much pressure on the Indians as possible.         
	Apart from the baggage of history, Sri Lanka also come with a young bowling attack. Sangakkara chose to look at that in positive light.         
	Inexperience is sometimes a good thing. The Indian batsmen havent played our fast bowlers regularly in the longer form of the game. That can work in our favour, he said. Experience, especially in a place like India, is good to have, but fresh perspective, attitude and enthusiasm can sometimes be a bonus.         
	Sangakkara did not buy the argument that the Indian Premier League (IPL), having made the Indian players and conditions familiar to visiting teams, has dented Indias home advantage. He spoke of the flexibility all-rounder Angelo Mathews lent to his team, and the various combinations the think-tank could adopt to suit different conditions.         
	We have great options, especially since we have Mathews, who gives us the flexibility of playing three spinners, Sangakkara said.         
	That frees up one spot if the wicket is spin-friendly. Most probably, well play two fast bowlers and two spinners, and Mathews. That makes it a well-balanced side. We could even go into the game with three out-and-out fast bowlers with Mathews in support and one spinner, or two fast bowlers and two spinners.         
	Sangakkara refused to compare Harbhajan Singh with Muttiah Muralidharan. I never compare anyone with Murali. For me, he is better than anyone. But Harbhajan is always a threat, and we never underestimate him, he said.

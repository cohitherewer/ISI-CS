The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting fine after injury
                                                   Ponting fine after injury
                      
	Nottingham: Ricky Ponting was hit by a cricket ball during nets but the team management assured the batsman is fine and there is no cloud of doubt hovering over his availability for any of the World Twenty20 matches.         
	Michael Hussey struck a ball in the nets at Trent Bridge which hit Ponting on the right wrist ahead of Australias warm-up match against Bangladesh.         
	Ponting did not take part in the rest of the net session but a team spokesman told the Australian Associated Press that there was nothing to worry.         
	He copped a whack on the wrist and had it iced for the rest of training. Hes fine, though, and hell be back tomorrow. There was no need to have an X-ray, he said.         
	Its just a whack on the wrist basically ... it shouldnt be any issue at all, he added.         
	Ponting had ice pack applied on the area hit by the ball and was seen with a bandage covering the part between wrist and elbow.         
	Even though the Australian joined his team-mates again in the ground, he did not take part in any activity.         
	Incidentally, Ponting had a surgery on the same wrist in July last year. (PTI)

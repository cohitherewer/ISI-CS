The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sehwag, Dhoni bigger hitters than me, says Yusuf Pathan
                                                     Sehwag, Dhoni bigger hitters than me, says Yusuf Pathan
            A STAFF REPORTER            Yusuf Pathan                           
	Calcutta: Yusuf Pathan continues to amaze with his sixes, but the Rajasthan Royals all-rounder rates Virender Sehwag and Mahendra Singh Dhoni as bigger hitters.         
	There are bigger strikers of the cricket ball than me  (like) Sehwag, Dhoni. I am just starting out. How can you club me with them? I have a long way to go, Yusuf told the official website.         
	There are some great players who have better strike rates. I am happy where I am and would prefer being there, he said.         
	Asked who was his favourite power-hitter, Yusuf said: I have always liked watching (Matthew) Hayden. He has been somebody I have seen a lot. At home, Sehwag and Dhoni are obvious choices.         
	From the old times it has to be (Krish) Srikkanth. I have also heard from people about Salim Durrani. I havent seen him play but I believe he was very good, he said.         
	The key Rajasthan Royals player said he wants to stay both modest and hungry for success.         
	If you think you have become big, then the hunger dies. The more you are grounded the hungrier you remain. I want to be what they call a bhooka sher (hungry tiger) whose hunger never dies, he said.         
	Yusuf would play a key role in Indias ICC World Twenty20 title defence in England next month and the all-rounder said he would put his best foot forward.         
	I know everybody will be watching me. There may be increased scrutiny on me but it does not bother me. I just want to do well for my country and enjoy my cricket. I just want to keep trying hard, he said.         
	It is the same feeling for me like it was two years ago. When you play for the country it is always about keeping up the performance and doing well at all times, Yusuf said.

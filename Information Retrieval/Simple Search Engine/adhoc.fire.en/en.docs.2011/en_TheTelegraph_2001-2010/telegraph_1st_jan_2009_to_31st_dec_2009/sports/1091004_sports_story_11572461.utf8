                                                     Abhra saves EBs day

	Pune: East Bengal held off a spirited challenge from I-League debutants Pune FC (PFC) to emerge unscathed with a 0-0 draw in their opening round match at the Shiv Chatrapati Sports Complex here on Saturday.         
	Playing without a foreigner and dogged by issues off the field, East Bengal did well to keep down a buoyant opponent who were playing in front of a boisterous home crowd.         
	Pune FC were clearly the better team and the scoreline did not reflect their domination over the visitors.         
	The only team to have filled the full quota of foreign players, Pune FC reaped their rewards as Brazilian forward Edmar Figueira and Japanese Izumi Arata took the attack to the East Bengal defence from the outset.         
	Uzbek Sergey Tokov had an impact on the game too with his interceptions and passing skills and, combined well with Douhou Pierres class. And Chika Wali proved to be the rock of their defence.         
	Captain S Venkatesh once again shone in the midfield and Sunil Kumar was equally menacing.         
	The retreating monsoon added its share of thrill to the flood-lit atmosphere, but it would be difficult to say whether the showers amplified the poor ground conditions or made up for the same.         
	The wet under-foot condition was a crucial factor when Edmar, having entered the box, lost control of the ball with only custodian Abhra Mondal to beat just at the hour mark.         
	East Bengal would be happy to walk away with a point, but that was mainly due to Abhra who made a few out of the world blocks to deny the rampaging Pune FC.         
	That their inspirational captain Bhaichung Bhutia had to resort to pulling of a rival defender and was rightfully penalised with a yellow card as early as in the 14th minute symbolised the teams morale. The star striker in fact got away with a handball in the second half while lunging to meet a pass.         
	But all that was understandable, given a non-existent midfield, as a result of which Bhutia and Subhash Singh hardly received any ball. It was not until the introduction Rennedy Singh in the 60th minute that the visitors began to show more urgency in the attack.         
	If Rennedys introduction revitalised the visitors attack, Pune FC responded with their share of offence, contributing to some pulsating action in the last 20 minutes.         
	Abhra had to make a desperate dive to save an Edmar drive from 30 yards in the 67th minute, but 12 minutes later the East Bengal goal-stopper bungled in rushing out and was beaten hands down by Izumis looping volley. Unfortunately for Pune FC the ball hit the horizontal.         
	East Bengal then came close to scoring when Rennedys free-kick hit the bar and Izumi was once again in action as Pune FC launched a quick counter-attack. Abhra once again stood between the hosts and the goal.

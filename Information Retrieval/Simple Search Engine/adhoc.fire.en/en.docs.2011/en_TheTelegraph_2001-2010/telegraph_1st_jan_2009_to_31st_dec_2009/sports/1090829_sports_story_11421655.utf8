The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal is sceptical about his knees
                                                     Nadal is sceptical about his knees
                  Nadal                     
	Washington: Over the past 10 weeks Rafael Nadal had little choice but to put his feet up and relax at home in Majorca while his rivals chased after the biggest prizes in the sport.         
	Instead of defending his cherished Wimbledon crown, Nadal had to nurse his sore knees and became an expert on how to overcome the effects of tendinitis.         
	Speaking on his chances at the US Open, a Grand Slam he is yet to win, he said: I think I am going to have more options in the next few years. The important thing is to feel confident with my knees and when I feel confident with my knees, Im going to be able to practise harder and find my best performance as soon as possible.         
	Its tough to say if I am going to be ready 100 per cent for the US Open. Its normal, isnt it, because after a long break and major injuries, its difficult to be ready. But I will try, he added.         
	He added that he wasnt too sure about his knees, as he said: It seems like my knees are much better. But you never know. I have to play at the top level to see how it affects my knees.         
	I was watching my knees with the doctors and yeah I underwent a lot of treatment. I dont know exactly what precautions I can take but I learned something about this injury and that can be important information for the future.         
	Terming his comeback as a pleasure, he said: Its always a pleasure being in tournaments.         
	The important thing is to win the tournament. It doesnt matter who you win against in the final. For me, a win against Roger (Federer) is always very, very special, but I would love to win any Grand Slam against someone in the final. Doesnt matter who the rival is, he summed up.

  -   City giants face Sporting Clube de Goa today
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa believes that the contest for the national league is still wide open. For the Moroccan coach, Fridays Round XIV encounter against Sporting Clube de Goa is definitely a crucial match, but he felt it couldnt be considered the title decider.         
	It is definitely an important match tomorrow, Karim said after Mohun Bagans practice session at the club ground on Thursday evening.         
	I would say its definitely not like a do-or-die match. Surely I know it will be an important encounter for both of us (Mohun Bagan and Sporting Clube) and we would like a positive result, Karim said.         
	He however, appeared a bit cautious too. Injecting optimism in his boys, Karim stressed that taking full points from every match is not possible, and said that he has delivered this message to his boys.         
	One cannot have full points from every match and the message is delivered to my boys. I told them that the league is still not over. There are seven games left, he elaborated.         
	With no injury worries or card problems, Karim will go in with a full-strength squad against the Goan superpowers who currently lead the table a point ahead of second-placed Bagan on 28.         
	While the Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto and Bhaichung Bhutia will be leading from the front to ensure Bagan extend their eight-match winning streak, at the heart of the midfield, there will be Marcos Pereira  the second Brazilian in the team  and Rakesh Masih. P.C. Lalawmpuiya, who suffered a hamstring injury during a practice session on Wednesday is fit for selection.         
	Habibur Rehman Mondal and Deepak Mondal will start wide while N.S. Manju and Ghanaian Peter Odafe will man the defence.         
	The Goans, meanwhile are banking big time on their Nigerian duo of Nathaniel Amos and Elijah Obagbemiro Junior. They will also have another foreigner, Brazilian medio Luciano Sabrosa.         
	While Amos will be returning from a three-week injury lay off, defender Harmanjot Khabra will be the other comeback man on Friday.         
	According to coach Viswas Gaonkar, he and his boys are under no pressure against the city giants who are enjoying a golden run.         
	They are a changed side altogether from what we had seen during the first few encounters in the league. They are confident and compact. But we are not under any pressure, Gaonkar said after their practice session at the Mohammedan Sporting ground.         
	While a win for Bagan will take them to 30, the Goans, if they have the last laugh on Friday, would have opened a comfortable four point gap between themselves and the green and maroon brigade on the league table.

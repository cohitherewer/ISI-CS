The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The biggest challenge is mental fatigue: Kirsten
                                                   The biggest challenge is mental fatigue: Kirsten
                      
	Cape Town: Living life out of a suitcase could prove detrimental for the Indian players in the ICC World Twenty20 Championship in England, warns coach Gary Kirsten who feels fatigue could affect the defending champions campaign.         
	India have been playing non-stop cricket for a long time, travelling from one corner of the world to the other.         
	They play their first warm-up game ahead of the T20 World Cup against New Zealand on June 1, just seven days after the Indian Premier League (IPL) gets over.         
	The defending champions first match in the tournament, commencing on June 5, will be against Bangladesh a day later. The Indian players have been on the road for a long time and the biggest challenge will be mental fatigue, said Kirsten.         
	However, the former South Africa opener said the current bunch of players have the ability to get over such situations.         
	They have enormous pride when representing India and have become a tight unit over the past few months. Im sure they will look forward to reuniting and playing for their country, he said.         
	Kirsten believes that, as defending champions, India would be under a lot of pressure, but is also confident that his wards have the ability to come good in the tournament.         
	When you are defending champions there will always be added pressure. That goes with the territory of high-performing teams. This team has played in many pressure situations since the Twenty20 World Cup in 2007 and has shown what they are capable of, he told a website.         
	The former South African opener is not too concerned about the conditions in England since it will be the same for every team.         
	Every country has its own conditions which each team and individual needs to come to terms with. The players are aware of those conditions and what is required, to give themselves the best chance of performing. Most of the Indians have played in England and know what to expect.         
	India may have been on a roll, winning matches home and away, but Kirsten ruled out suggestions of any complacency in the squad.         
	Experienced players understand the demands and pressures of World Cup tournaments. Throw in a few talented and fearless young players and you have a great mix in the team. There is certainly no danger of complacency within the Indian team. We pride ourselves in taking each game as it comes and giving 100 per cent on a daily basis while representing Team India, he said.

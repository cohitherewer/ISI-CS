                                                     Mathews crushes India

	Colombo: Indias status as the No. 1 one-day team was shortlived after the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led side slumped to a 139-run defeat against Sri Lanka in an inconsequential match of the Compaq Cup tri-series here Saturday.         
	India are now No. 3 in the ODI rankings. Both India and Australia have the same ratings of 125 but the Aussies are ahead by virtue of playing lesser number of matches. South Africa continue to lead the table.         
	Although India were already assured of a place in Mondays final after their big win over New Zealand Friday, Dhoni and his men needed an unbeaten run in the tournament to maintain their No. 1 ODI team status.         
	However, Sanath Jayasuriya and Thilina Kandambi combined with the bat and then Angelo Mathews ignited fire with the ball to take the hosts to the convincing victory.         
	Chasing 308 for victory India were bowled out for a paltry 168 in 37.2 overs as only six batsmen could manage to reach double figures.         
	Earlier, opting to bat Sri Lanka rode on Jayasuriyas blistering 98 off 79 balls and Kandambis unbeaten 91 down the order to score 307 for six in their alloted 50 overs.         
	Needing 308 for win, Indias makeshift opening duo of Sachin Tendulkar and Dinesh Karthik (16 off 23) started the innings on a positive note adding 32 runs in the first six overs before Sri Lanka pulled back with the wicket of Karthik.         
	Trying to glide a leg side delivery to the fine-leg boundary, the Tamil Nadu wicket-keeper gloved a simple catch to Kumar Sangakkara off left-arm seamer Thilan Thusharas bowling.         
	From there on both Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid found the going tough, though the Master Blaster found the fence in between. Tendulkar hit some elegant flicks and glances to score his boundaries before Nuwan Kulasekara got the vital wicket in the 14th over with India scoreboard reading 67. He struck five fours in his short but classy 33-ball 27.         
	Vice-captain Yuvraj Singh made his arrival in style, clobbering Kulasekara for four over mid-on in the very second ball he faced but thereafter went to a shell as he played and missed Lasith Malinga on several occasions.         
	Boundaries were far and few as Dravid and Yuvraj kept the scoreboard ticking with ones and twos before the right-hander cut loose in the 19th over, hitting a four and a six of Dilshans consecutive deliveries to pick 13 runs off the over.         
	But Malinga broke the dangerously-looking 38-run fourth wicket stand as Yuvraj edged one to Sangakkara.         
	After that the famed Indian line up crumbled like a pack of cards as they lost five wickets for mere 25 runs as Angelo Mathews wreaked havoc, picking three six wickets for mere 20 runs in his six overs.         
	Suresh Rainas misery with the bat continued as he made a duck. He gave catching practice to Sangakkara in the very first ball he faced off Mathews. Dravid was the next to follow, bowled by Mathews as the right-hander went for an extravagant drive.         
	In his next over and innings 28th, Mathews struck twice, first castling skipper Dhoni and then Yusuf Pathan handed a regulation catch to Sangakkara, thereby dashing Indias hopes with the scoreboard reading 130 for seven.         
	Mathews rampage continued unabated as he disturbed both Harbhajan Singh and Asish Nehras timbers.         
	The duo of RP Singh (19 not out) and Ishant Sharma (13) did make a last ditch effort to take Indias score to some respectability by adding 29 runs before Ajantha Mendis wrapped up the proceedings.         
	Earlier, Jayasuriya returned to form with a blistering fashion. The 40-year-old smashed 13 boundaries in his innings.           (AGENCIES)

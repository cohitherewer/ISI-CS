The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Collingwood, Prior run riot
                                                   Collingwood, Prior run riot
                      
	Port of Spain: Paul Collingwood hit an unbeaten 101 Saturday as England reached 372 for four at lunch on the second day of the fifth and final Test against the West Indies.               
	At midnight, England were 476 for four. Paul Collingwood (156) and Matt Prior (107) were at the crease.               
	The 32-year-old Collingwood added 47 to his overnight total to reach his ninth Test century, cracking eight fours off 207 balls in four hours and adding an unbeaten stand of 104 off 141 deliveries with wicketkeeper Matt Prior.         
	Prior was 57 not out off 67 deliveries as England overcame the early loss of captain Andrew Strauss for 142 and Owais Shah for 33 after resuming on 258 for two at Queens Pak Oval.         
	Fidel Edwards, who took one for 49, led the home teams attack in the morning session. Armed with the second new ball, he broke through in the days third over when he plucked out Strauss leg stump as the England skipper came too far across his stumps.         
	Strauss, who posted his 17th Test century on Friday, hit 11 fours off 271 balls in just more than six hours.         
	When Shah, resuming after retiring hurt on Friday, ran himself out for 33, England was wobbling at 268 for four. Shah was undone by a fine piece of fielding from substitute Dwayne Bravo, whose direct hit from mid-wicket caught the batsman short.         
	Prior, returning to the team after missing the fourth Test to spend time with his wife and newborn son, quickly deflated the West Indian spirits with his forthright approach.         
	He spanked Edwards for three fours in one over to get going and dominated the early part of his century stand with Collingwood.         
	Collingwood, who fell for 96 in the previous Test, brought up his second century of the series in the final over before lunch when he swept the gentle medium pace of Brendan Nash for a single.         
	England are trailing 0-1 in the series after losing the first Test in Kingston and failing to win the third and fourth Tests in spite of setting up huge totals.         
	The second Test in St. Johns was abandoned because of a bad outfield.           (AP)

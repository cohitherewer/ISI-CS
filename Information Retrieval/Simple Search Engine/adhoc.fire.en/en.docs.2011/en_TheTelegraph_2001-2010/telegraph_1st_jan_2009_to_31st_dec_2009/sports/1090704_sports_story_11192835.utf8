The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev hits 3-under
                                                   Jeev hits 3-under
                      
	Paris: Jeev Milkha Singh returned from a rib injury and fired three-under 68 for the tied 20th place but compatriot Jyoti Randhawas opening round of 76 jeopardised his prospects of making the cut in the Open de France golf tournament here.         
	Among others, Kolkata pro SSP Chowrasia carded 69 to lie tied 32nd while Delhi lad Shiv Kapurs one-over 72 had him tied 85th.         
	Paired with Colin Montgomerie and Miguel Angel Jimenez, Jeev had, by and large, a satisfying round with the 17th hole bogey being the lone blot on the card.         
	Jeev said he could still feel the pain in his ribs but was happy with the show.         
	I played the pro-am with an anti-inflammatory patch on, and it wasnt too bad. There was a bit of discomfort, but it felt much better than during the US Open time. And the good news is that I am hitting the ball quite ok, he said.         
	I am pleased with my opening-round three-under 68. I made only one bogey, and that was the irritating part. It came on the 17th hole for me  eighth of the course  and I hate making bogeys in the last couple of holes, said the Indian.

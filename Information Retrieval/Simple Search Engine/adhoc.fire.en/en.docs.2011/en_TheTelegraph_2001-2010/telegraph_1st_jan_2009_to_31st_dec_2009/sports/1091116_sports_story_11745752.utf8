The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Reputations are there to be made: Kumar
                                                                                                                                   Reputations are there to be made: Kumar
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Ahmedabad: Kumar Sangakkara feels that his young side have a good chance of shining in this series. Reputations are there to be made, the Lanka captain told a news conference Sunday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The wicket         
	The best way to judge is to play on it. You make a spot decision and then decide how it will play But right now it look like a good Test wicket and should be good to bat on initially.         
	Tillekaratne Dilshans injury (twisted ankle)         
	At the moment he has recovered very well. Other than that there have been no other worries.         
	Practising with SG balls in the lead-up to the series         
	We flew down about 180 SG balls to Sri Lanka and practised with them for two months. Hopefully, that will give us an edge         
	Whether the spinners will have an edge in the series         
	Both the spinners and fast bowlers will be very important Early breakthroughs are going to be the key         
	Whether Rangana Herath will play         
	Well, it is an interesting choice. We have to do a lot of thinking to do but he has a very good chance of playing.         
	The fast bowlers inexperience         
	Reputations are there to be made... You go out there and if you have the enthusiasm, you are going to do well. They have an opportunity to pick up the wickets of the big names in world cricket.         
	Indian bowling         
	We are prepared to meet the challenge.         
	On Murali playing his last series here         
	Hopefully, its not going to be his last. We are trying to convince him to stay on for a while. But he has been thinking about retirement for sometime now.         
	Comparison with Lankan teams that have visited India earlier         
	I wont say we have a massive advantage over earlier teams. We have a much improved pace attack. We have the balance in the team to play two or three specialist spinners and still have two fast bowlers playing.

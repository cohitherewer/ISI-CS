The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indo-Pak ties not just sport: Sachin
                                                   Indo-Pak ties not just sport: Sachin
                      
	Mumbai: Fans in India and Pakistan are very emotionally involved and cricket does not remain merely a sport when the arch-rivals lock horns, Sachin Tendulkar said on Friday.         
	Indian players are either garlanded like kings or treated like criminals, depending on the outcome of an Indo-Pak series, Tendulkar said at the launch of a book called Shadows Across the Playing Field.         
	Sometimes we say that cricket is just a sport... But that does not happen. You get different reactions on your performance, he said.         
	Referring to the 1997 ODI series in Canada, Tendulkar said: We beat Pakistan 4-1 and the reception we got in Delhi was incredible. About 5000-7000 fans were there to receive us at the airport at 2 a.m., he recalled.         
	He then revealed the other side of the coin.         
	In the same year, we lost an ODI series 1-2 and the reaction was completely different. People looked at us as if were criminals and we have done something wrong. We lost 1-2 and because Ijaz Ahmed played an outstanding innings (at Gaddafi).         
	These experiences teach you and help you lead a balanced life, he said. (PTI)

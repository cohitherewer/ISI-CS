	Calcutta: Ashish Nehra, who made an impressive comeback into the one-day International side, was Wednesday rewarded with a Grade B contract worth Rs 40 lakh in retainer fees by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The left-arm pacer is back in the list after a one-year break.         
	Three players from Bengal  Manoj Tiwary, Ashok Dinda and Wriddhiman Saha  were included in the Group D of the annual contracts list, from October 1, 2009 to September 30, 2010, released by the BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan.         
	Right-handed batsman Tiwary is the new addition from Bengal to the lowest grade, which has Rs 15 lakh in retainer fees. The other new faces in the lowest grade are Dhawal Kulkarni, Abhishek Nayar and Ajinkya Rahane, all from Mumbai.         
	A total of 41 players, including Irfan Pathan, whose name was erroneously excluded from the initial list, was released Wednesday.         
	The BCCIs gradation committee, that met recently, retained nine players in the Grade A worth Rs 60 lakh in retainer fees.         
	The Grade A players are India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Yuvraj Singh, Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh.         
	All-rounder Irfan, who has been struggling with his fitness, has been demoted from Grade B to Grade C. Along with Irfan, Tamil Nadu batsman Subramanium Badrinath was also demoted to Grade C from Grade B.         
	Medim pacer Praveen Kumar and wicket-keeper Dinesh Karthik were promoted to Grade B, worth Rs 40 lakh in retainer fees, from Grade C.         
	Leg-spinner Piyush Chawla got demoted to Grade D from C.

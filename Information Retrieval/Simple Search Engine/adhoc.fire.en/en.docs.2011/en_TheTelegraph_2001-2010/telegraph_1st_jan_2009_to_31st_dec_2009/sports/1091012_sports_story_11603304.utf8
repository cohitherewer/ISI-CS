The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Novak ends Marin run
                                                   Novak ends Marin run
                      
	Beijing: Second seed Novak Djokovic beat error-prone Croatian Marin Cilic 6-2, 7-6(4) in a rain-interrupted final to win his third title of the season at the China Open on Sunday.         
	The 22-year-old Serbian, who will move up to No. 3 in the world later this month, kept his 100 per cent career record against the world No. 15 intact in a contest long on rallies but short on quality.         
	Djokovic kissed the ground and threw his shirt into the crowd after his victory at the venue where he won Olympic bronze at the Beijing Games last year.         
	Cilic had been inspired during his two-set demolition of world No. 2 Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals and the more dangerous of the pair before the rain break, but struggled to pick up the pace after the 90-minute interruption.         
	Djokovic, who had saved six break points in his first three service games, seized on his chance and some deft touches and Cilic errors quickly put him a set up.         
	Cilic, who had never lost a tour final, rallied immediately by breaking Djokovic with his whipped returns to open the second set. That turned out to be only the first of six breaks in a topsy turvy set punctuated by long rallies with Djokovic claiming the last to bring up a tiebreak.         
	US Open semi-finalist Djokovic always looked the most likely winner and secured his third victory in eight finals this year when Cilic made the last of his 25 unforced errors by going wide with a forehand.         
	In the womens final, Kuznetsova, the reigning French Open champion and sixth seed here, used her powerful ground strokes and extra experience to run Polands Agnieszka Radwanska around the court, winning 6-2, 6-4.

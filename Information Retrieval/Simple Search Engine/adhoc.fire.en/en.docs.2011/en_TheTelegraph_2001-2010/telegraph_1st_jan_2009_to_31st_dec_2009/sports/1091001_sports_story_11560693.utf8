The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians are left high and dry
                                                   Indians are left high and dry
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	A dramatic final day of league matches culminated in Australia making the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy while India bowed out despite a victory against the depleted West Indies.         
	In Centurion, Australia won through a bye off the last ball in a nail-biting finish. Though it looked completely one-sided at one stage with Ricky Ponting and Mike Hussey going strong, a collapse from 140 for two to 187 for eight dragged the match to a tense finish.         
	When Mitchell Johnson left, Pakistan looked in control but Brett Lee and Nathan Hauritz saw off some nervy moments at the end to see their team through. Comeback man Mohammed Asif was superb in his second spell, and Rana Naved-ul Hasan lethal. Pakistan, who were assured of a semi-final berth before Wednesdays tie, raised their game when it mattered and almost pulled it off.         
	But it wasnt to be.         
	India were left high and dry at the Wanderers in Johannesburg as even the best efforts of their bowlers were not enough. Ashish Nehra and Praveen Kumar picked up three wickets each as the West Indies were bundled out for 129 in 36 overs. India overcame a bad start  Gautam Gambhir and Rahul Dravid left early  to win by seven wickets in 32.1 overs.         
	Dinesh Karthik (34) and Virat Kohli then added 92 for the third wicket to steady the ship. Abhishek Nayar then joined Man of the Match Kohli (79 not out off 104 balls) to take India home. Kohli played a responsible innings showing grit and determination.         
	Earlier, the India captain called correctly for the first time in the tournament. He was still harbouring high hopes at the start saying it was easier to reach a certain net run-rate while chasing  just in case Pakistan won. The Indian resurgence, though, came a little late.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhonis pace brigade  minus Ishant Sharma  enjoyed the friendly conditions, getting consistent swing and ripping through a hapless West Indies top order.         
	As India toyed with an inexperienced West Indies line-up, Dhoni, too decided to join the fun. Before the start of the 17th over, he handed over his keeping gloves to Karthik, and decided to bowl  something he does to good effect consistently in the nets.         
	The first two balls were long hops, and were duly punished by Travis Dowlin. The fourth ball, though, was fuller, and took the inside edge onto the stumps. It was Dhonis first wicket in international cricket. Dhoni then bowled one more over, and also had a difficult chance dropped by Karthik.         
	The West Indies had a tottering start and lost half of their side inside 17 overs with Darren Sammy (23), David Bernard (22) and Devon Smith (21) being the only notable scorers for the Caribbeans.         
	Praveen Kumar drew the first blood removing Andre Fletcher (0) in the last ball of the first over. Ashish Nehra then dealt a double blow, removing Kieran Powell (5) and Smith in the same over.         
	The lanky left-arm pacer got the outer edge of Powells bat as the West Indies were reduced to 26 for two in 7.2 overs and, three balls later, Smith perished while chasing an away going delivery.         
	Praveen struck again in the 11th over, removing skipper Floyd Reifer (1) when he had him caught at second slip by Karthik.         
	Sammy and Bernard did show some resistance, sharing 32 runs for the sixth wicket before leg-spinner Amit Mishra induced the latter with a flighted delivery outside the off stump, only to hand Dravid his second catch at first slip. Sammy was the next to depart with Nehra striking with the first ball of his second spell.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ferrari issue pull-out threat
                                                   Ferrari issue pull-out threat
                      
	Maranello (Italy): Ferrari said on Tuesday it wont enter next seasons Formula One championship unless the sports governing body revokes its new budget cap.         
	The Italian team, which has been involved in all 60 seasons of F1 racing, said the new FIA guidelines were arbitrary and would set a double standard. It said equal rules for everyone are necessary for the sport to continue.         
	The same rules for all teams, stability of regulations, the continuity of ... endeavours to methodically and progressively reduce costs, and governance of Formula One are priorities for the future, Ferrari said in a statement after a board meeting.         
	If these indispensable principles are not respected, and if the regulations decided for 2010 will not change, Ferrari does not intend to enter its cars in the next Formula One world championship. Ferrari said it hoped fans would understand this painful choice.         
	FIA president Max Mosley is leading the FIAs push to curb costs, with a voluntary 40 million (euro45 million; $60 million) budget cap being made available to teams.         
	Teams that dont adhere to the cap will not receive the same technical freedom; something Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo has called fundamentally unfair.         
	Mosley has said the sport could survive without the Italian giant, although Formula One drivers have disagreed.         
	The Formula One Teams Association has asked for urgent talks with the governing body over the budget cap. The FIA has set a deadline of May 29 for teams wishing to compete in 2010 to submit entries and state whether they want a cap or not.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni century gives India 333-run lead

  - India post their highest-ever total in Tests       K. KUMARASWAMY                                        MS Excel!  India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in a belligerent mood at the Brabourne Stadium on Friday.     
	Mumbai: Virender Sehwag missed out on a major landmark but Mahendra Singh Dhoni carved out a perfect century to put India in sight of victory in the third and final Test of the Jaypee Cup against Sri Lanka.         
	Coming to the crease with the lead not looking good enough to reasonably ensure they wouldnt need to bat again, Dhoni hit an unbeaten 100 to help his side post a mammoth 726 for nine declared, Indias highest-ever Test total.         
	It was one of the most methodical innings by a wicketkeeper-batsman down the order and gave the Indians, chasing victory to capture the No.1 spot in the ICC Test rankings, a healthy lead of 333 runs.         
	Lanka, 11 for no loss at stumps on Day III, now face a Herculean task, similar to what the Indians had in the first Test at Ahmedabad.         
	The topic of discussion among the commuters in the morning was whether Sehwag would manage to breach the 400 barrier.         
	It was as if the triple century was a given.         
	The usual irate temper of the rush hour had given way to passionate arguments. Its incredible how one mans exploits on the cricket pitch can change the mood of a nation.         
	Outside the gates, serpentine queues, in anticipation of the historic moment, had begun forming by as early as 7.30am.         
	It turned out to be a huge anti-climax, then, when Sehwag fell seven short of what would have been his third triple hundred. The right-hander stretched forward to turn Muttiah Muralidharan down mid-on and ended up giving a simple return catch instead.         
	Sehwags 293, which lasted six hours and six minutes and took 254 balls, was still a world record of sorts.         
	No other batsman before him has managed a 290-plus score after scoring two triple hundreds. Of course, there are only three members in that exclusive club!         
	There was a collective sigh for a moment before the 15,000-odd crowd gave a standing ovation that lasted till the batsman had disappeared into the dressing room.         
	Sehwags fall had two immediate effects: Outside the stadium, the black ticket prices went down and, inside, the fielders shoulders were no longer drooping.         
	They managed to get Sachin Tendulkar (53) and V.V.S. Laxman (62) relatively cheaply when both appeared set for big scores.         
	Yuvraj Singhs wicket (23) came as a bonus. But whatever hopes Kumar Sangakkara might have been nurturing, of bringing the Indian innings to a quick end, were dashed by Dhonis second century of the series.         
	The India captain made the most of a reprieve on six when an outside edge off Rangana Herath flew between Mahela Jayawardene and Tillekaratne Dilshan in the slips.         
	His half-century came in 101 minutes with one four and a six but and, within the next 53 minutes, he had struck five more sixes and two more fours.         
	Dhonis last-wicket partnership with Pragyan Ojha (five not out) produced 56 runs and saw the hosts cross the 700 mark.         
	Muralidharan had to use all his experience for his four wickets. Bowling around the wicket, the worlds leading wicket-taker in Tests and ODIs seemed to have finally got a measure of the Indian batsmen.

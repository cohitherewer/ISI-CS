                                                   Dippenaar:T amp;T are favourites
                      
	Hyderabad: After receiving a severe bashing from the Trinidad and Tobago batsmen, Diamond Eagles captain Boeta Dippenaar Sunday tipped Trinidad and Tobago to win the T20 tournament.         
	Trinidad and Tobago posted a huge 213 for four, following a brilliant batting display and then restricted their rivals to 189 for five to storm into the semi-finals.         
	Dippenaar was impressed with the way the Caribbean batsmen took on their bowling attack.         
	They played magnificently. They are favourites to win the Champions League. Chasing 214 was really tough. Had it been 195, game was on, Dippenaar said after the match. Had we executed our bowling correctly towards the end, it could have been better.         
	The South African was also pleased with his own teams show in the tournament.         
	We have played excellent cricket. They (players) have proved that they will play for the Eagles in the Champions League for many more years, he said.         
	Winning captain Daren Ganga was also happy with the performance of his team, but warned his boys of geting overconfident. It was an intense match. They put us under pressure, but I knew, with that total, we were in for a win. Credit to the guys. They are hungry to perform and know exactly what they have to do. Im really happy with the performance of the boys. We need to take it step by step and not get overconfident. Im looking forward to the semis, Ganga said.         
	Adjudged the Man of the Match for his aggressive 63, Adrian Barath was happy after making an exciting debut in international Twenty20 matches for his side.         
	It was my best Twenty20 innings. Perkins also batted well and that helped. We set it up, and Pollard and Stewart did well in the end. I am happy after this performance and hoping to be in the final, Barath said.

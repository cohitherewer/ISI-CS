	Hyderabad: Uttar Pradesh lost early wickets to be left struggling at 91 for three at close on the second day of the Ranji Trophy final on Tuesday.         
	Earlier, UP allowed Mumbai to amass 402 in their first innings. Resuming at the overnight score of 297 for six, Mumbai capitalised on UPs fielding lapses as they scored another 105 runs before the innings folded up. UP dropped as many as four catches and missed one stumping and two run-outs to allow Mumbai to gain the upper hand.         
	At stumps, Uttar Pradesh were trailing by 311 runs with seven wickets in hand. Opener Shivakant Shukla was batting on 46 and Parvinder Singh was yet to open his account.         
	UP were reeling at 6 for two in less than three overs at the start of their innings. Zaheer Khan removed opener Tushar Srivastava by getting him caught behind with the fourth ball of the third over.         
	UP received another jolt when Suresh Raina departed after facing just one ball. Raina was run out by Sairaj Bahutule for a duck.         
	The other opener, Shivakant Shukla, however, played cautiously and seemed like repeating his semi-final performance, which helped UP secure the final berth.         
	Captain Mohammed Kaif, who came out at No. 4, gave some stability to the innings but left after nicking a Zaheer delivery in the 44th over. Kaifs 33 came off 129 balls with the help of five hits to the fence and a towering six. Kaif stitched a 85-run partnership with Shukla for the third wicket that gave some stability to the innings.         
	Earlier, Rohit Sharma (141) added 28 to his overnight 113. Rohit appeared to be blessed as he survived many close calls.         
	Left-arm spinner Praveen Gupta struck twice in his second over of the day. He scalped Rohit when the Mumbai batsman came down the track and was caught by Parwinder at point.         
	Within a space of three balls, Gupta also sent Ramesh Powar back to the pavilion.         
	But Ajit Agarkar (47) gave the UP team a tough time as he batted with confidence before being caught and bowled by RP Singh.         
	Last man out Zaheer was given a reprieve when Mumbai were 363 and he did not let go the opportunity as he went on to add 33 runs before falling in the first over after lunch.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Think tank to meet on Aug. 4: SRK
                                                   Think tank to meet on Aug. 4: SRK
                      
	New Delhi: Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Kolkata Knight Riders co-owner Shah Rukh Khan Saturday said that the captaincy of the side would be decided in a series of meetings from August 4-15.         
	We will be meeting on August 4 and thats when all decisions on coach, captaincy and hopefully a formula for winning at least some of the matches next year would be worked out, Shah Rukh told a press conference here.         
	Nothing has been decided, neither the coach nor the other things I read about in papers. The whole team would be meeting for the first time post IPL on August 4 and it will be a series of meetings till August 15, the Bollywood star added.         
	KKR, which finished bottom of the table this season, sacked coach John Buchanan after the debacle and former India coach John Wright is tipped to fill in the post vacated by the Australian.         
	The teams captaincy is also a subject of massive speculation and there are reports that Sourav Ganguly, who was replaced by New Zealander Brendon McCullum this season, is all set to return at the helm for IPL III. But Shah Rukh rejected such reports and said though suggestions have been made on the matter a decision is still pending.

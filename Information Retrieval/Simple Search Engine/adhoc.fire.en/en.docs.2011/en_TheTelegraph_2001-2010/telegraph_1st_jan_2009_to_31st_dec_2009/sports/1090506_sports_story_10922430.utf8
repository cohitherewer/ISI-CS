The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The Knight Riders fail to exorcise demons 
                                                   The Knight Riders fail to exorcise demons 
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	There seems to be no end to Kolkata Knight Riders woes in the second edition of the Indian Premier League. On Tuesday, they crashed to their seventh defeat in nine matches as the Delhi DareDevils cantered to the 155-run target with an over to spare. The DareDevils now occupy the top spot in the standings.         
	There was no stopping the DareDevils from the moment they set off on their chase. Brendon McCullum looked a leader lost for ideas in the mayhem as the rival batsmen toyed with the bowling. So much for the doctrine of multiple captaincy!         
	Fours and sixes flowed from the blades of Gautam Gambhir and David Warner as the onslaught left the Knight Riders dazed. Once Warner left for a 23-ball 36, Tillekaratne Dilshan ensured there was no let up in the intensity.         
	Knight Riders did their chances no good by dropping three easy catches, Gambhir being the beneficiary on a couple of occasions. The DareDevils stand-in captain rode his luck  he also survived a close caught behind appeal off Moises Henriques  to an unbeaten 71 off 57 balls (7x4).         
	His unbroken 97-run partnership with Dilshan (42 not out off 34 balls) set up the nine-wicket victory, but the Knights have only themselves to blame for this unconvincing performance.         
	They fell short by at least 20 runs and it made a big difference in the end. The bowling lacked bite and the fielding continued to be pathetic. Besides, the ground fielding not being of the highest standard, McCullum, Henriques and Arindam Ghosh were all guilty of flooring catches.         
	Morne van Wyk tried to make the most of his chance at the top of the order, but was starved of strike for much of the innings. However, it was mainly due to his 74 off 48 balls that the Knights reached their highest total in the ongoing edition.         
	The Knight Riders had things going their way at the start. The injured Virender Sehwag was forced to miss another match for the DareDevils and Brendon McCullum won the toss, getting first use of a good batting pitch.         
	McCullum had insisted his side were still dangerous opponents as their abject performance so far left them with nothing to lose. But the sordid effort on the field did not justify his belief.         
	The Knight Riders captain began in a whirlwind fashion, cutting and pulling with disdain. With a new opening partner in Van Wyk, McCullum was determined to upset the bowlers rhythm.         
	He picked Dirk Nannes for special treatment, taking 21 runs off his second over. It included two huge sixes and a four. Once he clobbered Pradeep Sangwan over mid-wicket for a flat six, it looked like McCullum would make up for his poor form on Tuesday.         
	That was not to be as Sangwan had the last laugh. Another vociferous pull in the next over brought about his dismissal, the ball landing into the hands of Ashish Nehra at deep fine leg. His 35 came off 29 balls and included one boundary and three sixes.         
	McCullums dismissal, however, did bring about a lull in the scoring rate. While the Knights managed 54 in the first six overs, the next four produced only 15.         
	In fact, they had looked poised for a huge total after being 98 for 2 in 13 overs, but just couldnt get into fifth gear towards the end, despite having plenty of wickets in hand.         
	Van Wyk, though, made up for his slow start. Having almost been a spectator to the early blitzkrieg by McCullum, he opened up in the final ten overs. His innings included 11 boundaries.         
	Nannes was again at the receiving end going for 17 runs in the 17th over. Sangwan wasnt spared either, Van Wyk taking 15 off one of his overs.         
	Brad Hodge, who hit two consecutive half-centuries in the previous matches, made just 10 off 19 balls but Van Wyk seemed to have made up for his off-form. Hodges momentum robbing innings denied Knight Riders some valuable runs as they could score only in singles in the first five overs after the Powerplays.         
	Henriques, who replaced Chris Gayle, came in ahead of Sourav Ganguly at No.4. He started by giving Amit Mishra a maiden, but ended by contributing an unbeaten 30 off 24 balls.

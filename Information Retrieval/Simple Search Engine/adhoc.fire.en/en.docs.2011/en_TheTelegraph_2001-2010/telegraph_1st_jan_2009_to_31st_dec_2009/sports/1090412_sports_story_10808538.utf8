The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sports minister, who sacked Ranatunga, sought favours
                                                     Sports minister, who sacked Ranatunga, sought favours
    - Fundamental rights application says Lokuge interfered in SLCs functioning too          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Arjuna Ranatunga                                 
	Calcutta: Sports minister Gamini Lokuge, who removed Arjuna Ranatunga as chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), late last year, had in fact sought favours from him.         
	There was interference in SLCs functioning too.         
	Ranatunga (a member of Parliament and a former deputy minister) didnt oblige and, in his 35-page fundamental rights application before Sri Lankas Supreme Court, has listed instances when favours were asked.         
	The application (a copy of which is in The Telegraphs possession) will come up before the apex court on May 25.         
	Instances have been clubbed under Political influence in the functioning of the Cricket Board and the relevant portion starts with the following:         
	Notwithstanding the many assurances that had been made that there would not be any political influence in the affairs of Sri Lanka Cricket, most unfortunately, from the early stages of the appointment of the petitioner (Ranatunga), the first respondent (Lokuge), and his ministry, under his direction, sought to intervene and issue directions on matters which clearly were not in the best interests of the countrys cricket.         
	The petitioner rejected such interferences, which were against the interests of Sri Lanka Cricket, and has reason to believe that this was the principal cause for his removal         
	Now, excerpts from instances of favours sought by Lokuge and instances of interference by the minister:         
	 Request to sponsor tea and refreshments at a function to celebrate Lokuges completion of 25 years as a member of Parliament.         
	By letter dated 28/5/2008 from the coordinating secretary of the first respondent, on the letterhead Office for the Minister of Sports and Public Recreation, a request was made for Sri Lanka Cricket to sponsor tea and refreshments at a function to be attended by 800 invitees.         
	This request was taken up at the next meeting of Sri Lanka Cricket, on 13/6/2008, and the interim committee, including the petitioner, were of the opinion that this could not be allowed as this function was only a political event of the first respondent No contribution was, therefore, made by Sri Lanka Cricket.         
	Direction to bear part of the costs of a journalist who wished to cover the Bangladesh tour (December 2008-January 2009).         
	In or about 5/12/2008, the first respondent forwarded a request made by one Mr Sirinama Rajapakse, requesting a contribution towards the cost of his expenses for the Bangladesh tour, together with a notation thereon by the first respondent, directing the petitioner to make such a contribution.         
	The petitioner and Sri Lanka Cricket, however, decided that there was no basis to bear such costs, of one media person, and that they could not comply with the direction.         
	With the removal of the petitioner from Sri Lanka Cricket, the Competent Authority (sports secretary S. Liyanagama, the second respondent) immediately approved the payment to the media person.         
	[Till one-time stand-in captain Somachandra de Silvas appointment as SLC chairman, the Competent Authority had more or less been the supremo.]         
	 Direction that all insurance policies be channeled through the insurance agency obtained by the ministry of sports and public recreation.         
	By the second respondents letter dated 12/3/2008, Sri Lanka Cricket was informed that insurance policies had to be channeled through the insurance agency obtained by the ministry of sports and public recreation.         
	Had Sri Lanka Cricket accepted this purported direction it would have had to abandon all tender procedures in procuring insurance and direct all insurance policies to Sri Lanka Insurance Ltd, which is a private company. Therefore, the same could simply not be implemented.         
	Lokuges interference in the appointment of the selector-on-duty in Bangladesh has also been highlighted in the application.         
	Ranatunga and the interim committee nominated Ranjith Madurusinghe (most deserved) for the tour, but Lokuge intervened and sent Don Anurasiri instead.         
	The application, which is heavy on ammunition, has dealt at length with Ranatungas firm position on the Indian Premier League as well.         
	Bottomline is that the World Cup-winning captain was made to pay for the stand taken by him.         
	No wonder few former cricketers, in this region at least, are actually keen on getting involved in administration.

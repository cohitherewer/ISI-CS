The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sense of dj vu   for Vijay
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sense of dj vu   for Vijay
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                            
	Mumbai: All eyes were on stand-in opener Murali Vijay as the Indian team went through a rigorous practice session at the Brabourne stadium on Wednesday.         
	The 25-year-old right-hander from Tamil Nadu is set to come in place of Gautam Gambhir, who has made himself unavailable for the third and final Test, starting Wednesday, due to his sisters wedding. Given the turn of events, Vijay cannot be faulted for feeling dj vu.         
	In November 2008, he made his Test debut under similar circumstances in the fourth and final match against Australia. Back then, too, Vijay got a look-in due to Gambhirs absence, although for different reasons. The Delhi batsman was then serving a Test match ban for having elbowed fast bowler Shane Watson in the preceding Test at the Kotla. Unfortunately for Vijay, although he didnt look out of place in the highest level, his maiden Test has been his only one so far.         
	The good thing for Vijay is that he has been among runs in the lead up to the game. But then, domestic and Test cricket are like chalk and cheese.         
	Aware, perhaps, of this, Vijay had an extended session at the nets. First, he faced the spinners and the fast bowlers on separate wickets, as all batsmen usually do. Later, when most of the senior players had packed their kits and returned to the dressing room, he asked mental conditioning expert Paddy Upton to throw him some more balls.         
	The Brabourne track, and the soil in Mumbai in general, offers more bounce than those in northern India, and Vijay practised his horizontal shots as Upton hurled the leather from close.         
	Vijays illustrious opening partner, Virender Sehwag, was typically his cavalier self. The swashbuckling batsman repeatedly sent the red cherry sailing into the stands, both against the spinners and pacers.         
	Sachin Tendulkar settled for a relatively shorter session while Rahul Dravid was full of his trademark concentration.         
	The Sri Lanka team practised in the morning, their first session since the Kanpur Test, which they lost by an innings and 144 runs. One could not help but wonder at the visitors training schedule since they were at the ground within 12 hours of attending a sponsored function in the city late Sunday evening.

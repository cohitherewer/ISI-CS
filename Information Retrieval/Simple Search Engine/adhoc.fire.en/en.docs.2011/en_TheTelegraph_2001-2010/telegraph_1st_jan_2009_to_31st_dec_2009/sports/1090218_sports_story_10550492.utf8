	Wellington: Former New Zealand captain John Wright Tuesday warned Daniel Vettoris men from taking on India in seamer friendly pitches saying the move could backfire in the forthcoming series.         
	The last time India toured New Zealand six years ago they failed to settle down on the fast tracks andlost the Test series 0-2 and the one-dayers 2-5.         
	But Wright, also a former India coach, said New Zealand would be asking for trouble if they employ the same gameplan against the visitorss. The advantage India have this time is that, whatever conditions are rolled out by the hosts, they have the attack to make the most of them.         
	They have a lot of firepower to call on and Id imagine New Zealand will want to do just the opposite this time and ensure the pitches are pretty flat. But India will possibly want to settle a few old scores after what happened in 2002-03, Wright said.         
	Highly impressed with Ishant Sharma, Wright said he would be lethal under favourable conditions.         
	India must be very excited about his potential. Weve only really seen him bowling in sub-continental conditions, where its pretty hard work for the pacers, Wright said.         
	Youd expect once he gets to a place like New Zealand or England, where the conditions favour the seamers more, hell be at least as influential again. You cant overplay his importance right now, Wright told a website.         
	Wright said what makes India a very dangerous side now was the deadly combination of a lethal attack and very strong batting line-up.         
	Thats probably the biggest difference between the India side of today, and the combinations of previous years: the bowling. It now has everything  pace, swing, left-arm variation, wrist-spin and finger-spin. When I was there things were just starting to turn but now you really see the difference.

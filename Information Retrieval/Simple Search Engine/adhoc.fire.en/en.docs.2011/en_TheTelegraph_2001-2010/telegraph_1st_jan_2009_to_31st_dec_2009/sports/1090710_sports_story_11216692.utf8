The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Eye on IPL, NZ players sitting on contracts 
                                                   Eye on IPL, NZ players sitting on contracts 
                      
	Wellington: Some top players are delaying signing new contracts with New Zealand Cricket (NZC) over concerns that the teams international program next season will conflict with their lucrative roles in the Indian Premier League (IPL), local media reported Thursday.         
	A New Zealand daily named wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum and all-rounder Jacob Oram  the national teams highest-paid players in the IPL  among players who were hesitant to sign contracts until dates for the next IPL tournament had been released.         
	The newspaper said players were concerned New Zealands home series against Australia in March and April next year may clash with the Indian Twenty20 league. McCullum currently earns up to $700,000 and Oram $675,000 to play in the IPL, although the amount players receive is based on the number of games they play.         
	NZC chief executive Justin Vaughan told the newspaper players had until July 24 to sign contracts and he was confident all 20 players offered contracts last month would sign. Vaughan said concerns over a clash between the Australian tour and the IPL were speculative because dates for the Indian tournament had yet to be set.         
	The Australia tour is likely to stretch into the first week of April and it seems likely that the IPL is looking at an early-April start date.         
	We havent had any official indications from the players that there are any of these concerns, Vaughan said.         
	Six players offered contracts by NZC played in the last edition of the IPL  McCullum, Oram, captain Daniel Vettori, Jesse Ryder, Ross Taylor and Kyle Mills. Vaughan refused to say whether any of those players had yet to sign new contracts.         
	New Zealand Players Association boss Heath Mills said some players were seeking clarity regarding the schedule before signing the NZC contracts.         
	I am not aware of the final dates of the IPL, and the dates of the Australian series have not been finalised yet, but I would expect players would like to get some clarity around these, Mills said.

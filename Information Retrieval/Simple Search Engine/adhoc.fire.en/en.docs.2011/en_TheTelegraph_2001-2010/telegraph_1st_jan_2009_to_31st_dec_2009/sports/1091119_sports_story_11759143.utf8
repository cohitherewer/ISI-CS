The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiwary keeps chin up
                                                                                                                                   Tiwary keeps chin up
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Despite Karnataka being in the driving seat after the second days play in their Ranji Trophy Super League match at Mysore, stand-in Bengal captain Manoj Tiwary feels a good morning session, the new ball and a little bit of luck can still bring the visitors back into the match.         
	True, the wicket has eased out a lot and the batsmen are finding it easy. But with dew being a factor in the morning session and the new ball due after 11 overs, we are pretty hopeful. We have to put up a disciplined show and hope that they, too, commit a few mistakes, said Tiwary.         
	About the pitch, Tiwary said: Its obviously a lot more easier now. Theres not much purchase for the spinners. Neither are the fast bowlers extracting any swing off the pitch.         
	But the right-handed batsman rued the teams failure to add substantially to their overnight score on Wednesday. Bengal managed to add just 72 runs.         
	I definitely wanted the team to cross 400. But unfortunately that didnt happen. However, we are still very positive about the match, Manoj said.

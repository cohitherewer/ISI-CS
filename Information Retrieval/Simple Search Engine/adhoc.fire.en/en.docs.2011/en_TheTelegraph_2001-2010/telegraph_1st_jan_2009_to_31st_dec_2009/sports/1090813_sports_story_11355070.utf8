The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A good match, says Saina
                                                     A good match, says Saina
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Saina Nehwal                           
	Hyderabad: As the World No.6 made her way through the crowd to talk to the media after victory in her opener at the World Badminton Championships, all that could be heard at the Gachibowli stadium was the chanting of the name Saina over and over again.         
	The 19-year-old Saina Nehwal took 27 minutes to beat Russian Anastasia Prokopenko 21-10, 21-17 Wednesday in her first match after recovering from a mild bout of chicken pox, to move into the pre-quarter finals. The local favourite had received a bye in the first round.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q: How did you feel after the match?         
	A: It was a good match. It was the first time I was playing Anastasia and it was not that tough. However, I was a bit surprised with her dives. She recovered certain shots I was sure she wouldnt be able to.         
	Was fitness a problem?         
	I didnt get tired while playing. In fact, I garnered confidence after beating her (Anastasia), as this was my first match after the illness. However, it is tomorrow (Thursday) that my fitness will be tested as I play the 10th seed Petya Nedelcheva from Bulgaria. I have played her twice before and beaten her once that was the last time we met at the Indonesia Open earlier this year. I hope to play better than I did against Anastasia.         
	After the first game, which you won with ease, why did the scores run so even in the second?         
	In the first game I played a lot of smashes but in the second I stuck to rallies as the air conditioning draught differed on the either side of the court. It was slow on one side but fast on the other. In the first game, I attacked as the draught supported me. In the second, my smashes werent going that well. The draught had begun to help Anastasia so I stuck to long rallies, which I knew would help.         
	How much of a support has the crowd been?         
	Im happy with the crowd support and its great for the game that so many spectators are coming. It definitely felt good with all the cheering and support I hope this continues throughout the tournament.

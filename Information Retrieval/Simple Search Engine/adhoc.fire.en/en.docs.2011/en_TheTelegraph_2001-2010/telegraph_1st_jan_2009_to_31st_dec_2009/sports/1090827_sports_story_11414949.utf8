The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger wont mind doing a repeat
                                                     Tiger wont mind doing a repeat
  - I wouldnt say no to a cricketer, says talismanic former captain       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi                                 
	Calcutta: Its unusual for the talismanic Mansur Ali Khan Tiger Pataudi to get involved in a players versus administrators face-off, but having obliged senior pro Virender Sehwag on Monday, hes not averse to helping others too.         
	Look, its Sehwag who called me and asked if I would accompany him to Mr Arun Jaitleys house (in New Delhi)... I suppose he wanted moral support and I agreed, for I wouldnt say no to a cricketer, Pataudi told The Telegraph on Wednesday.         
	Jaitley, who is the Delhi and Districts Cricket Association (DDCA) president, hosted a meeting to defuse the crisis triggered by Sehwags rather unprecedented and sudden attack on the functioning of his parent body.         
	Specifically, Sehwag had been critical of the lack of transparency in selection and the dearth of enough men with credibility within the (faction-ridden and highly politicised) DDCA.         
	Sehwag, who is in the rehab stage after shoulder surgery two months ago, is the Delhi captain. Predictably, his stand got the backing of the Gautam Gambhirs. Gambhir had also been present at the meeting.         
	I spent an hour or so at Mr Jaitleys place and then left... I didnt stay till the end of that meeting... Before leaving, though, I did suggest that only Mr Jaitley do the talking in public... I cant, therefore, reveal anything that was discussed during the time I was present at his house, Pataudi added.         
	While Pataudi didnt say so, his presence went a long way towards ending the crisis, at least for now. Stature, after all, makes a difference and the very shrewd Sehwag played his cards smartly.         
	Confirmation is awaited, but it seems Sehwag wants Pataudi to get involved with the DDCA, in more than a token capacity. It will be interesting to see just how that works out.         
	Asked if he would oblige other cricketers as well, Pataudi replied: Of course... You wont find me going to anybody on my own, but if somebody wants my help, Ill do what I can... I definitely wouldnt turn down a request from a cricketer.         
	Thats an excellent gesture, to say the least, from arguably Indias finest captain, who is in his 69th year.

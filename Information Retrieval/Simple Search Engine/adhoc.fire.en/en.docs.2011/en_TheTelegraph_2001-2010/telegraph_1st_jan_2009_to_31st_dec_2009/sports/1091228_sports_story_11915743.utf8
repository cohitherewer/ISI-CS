The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Alan Hurst mulled   wicket shift
                                                                                                                       7                                      Alan Hurst mulled   wicket shift
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) Match Referee Alan Hurst said he considered shifting Sundays abandoned India-Sri Lanka ODI to an adjoining pitch, but had to call it off since the other track was not ready.         
	Hurst said he weighed the option of shifting the match to another pitch at the Kotla during his deliberations with the on-field umpires and both the captains.         
	The following is the statement issued by Hurst after the abandonment:         
	The decision to abandon the match was taken by myself, in consultation with the on-field umpires Marais Erasmus and Shavir Tarapore, and both captains as it was clear that the pitch had extremely variable bounce and was too dangerous for further play.         
	Id like to commend the on-field umpires and captains for continuing as long as they did in the hope that the pitch may settle down. Unfortunately, this did not happen.         
	Before abandoning the match, consideration was given to shifting the match to a secondary pitch. However, it was deemed impractical as the secondary pitch was not adequately prepared, the statement said.         
	Law 3.5.3 (b) of the ICCs Standard Playing Conditions dealing with fitness of ground (area of pitch) says: If at any time the umpires together agree that the conditions of ground, weather or light are so bad that there is obvious and foreseeable risk to the safety of any player or umpire, so that it would be unreasonable or dangerous for play to take place, then they shall immediately suspend play, or not allow play to commence or to restart. The decision as to whether conditions are so bad as to warrant such action is one for the umpires alone to make.

	Calcutta: It is going to be a straight contest between trainer Bharath Singhs filly Colourful Lady and Darius Byramjis ward Succeeding Star in Saturdays main attraction, the 2,000m Monsoon Cup. Although the Lady is enjoying a substantial weight advantage over the Bangalore challenger, it is not going to be a cakewalk for the Burden Of Proof daughter.

Apprentice Kishore Kadam partners the filly. The 1,200m Unknown Warrior Cup may also turn out to be a close affair among Shes Superb, Sparta and Chiefs Dream. However, the last named horse from trainer Daniel Davids yard appears to have improved considerably and he may score in the hands of jockey A. Imran Khan.

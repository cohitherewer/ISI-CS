The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Committee to solve impasse 
                                                   Committee to solve impasse 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Sunday failed to resolve the Bhaichung Bhutia-Mohun Bagan impasse and decided to appoint a one-man legal committee to look into the matter.         
	The AIFF president-in-charge Praful Patel, who addressed the media after the executive committee meeting, said: Unfortunately, we have failed to solve the problem so far.         
	We will appoint a one-member legal committee that will look into the matter. We hope to resolve the issue in a weeks time.         
	During the Indian teams practice session on the eve of the final, Bob Houghton said what happened with Bhutia was disgraceful.         
	I am surprised no one is asking the Mohun Bagan officials any question. The club needs a change of leadership, he said.         
	Earlier in the day, the AIFF general secretary, Alberto Colaco held separate meetings with both Bhaichung Bhutia and Bagan officials but both the parties refused to relent from their positions.         
	The AIFF will hold interviews of the candidates for the post of general secretary and Chief Executive Officer of the I-League in the third week of September.         
	The I-League will start in the first week of October. While Assam will hold the Federation Cup, the Santosh Trophy will be held in Goa.

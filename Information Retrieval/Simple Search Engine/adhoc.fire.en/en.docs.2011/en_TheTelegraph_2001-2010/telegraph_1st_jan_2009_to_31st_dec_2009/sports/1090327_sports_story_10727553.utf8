The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warne: IPL in SA wont be the same
                                                   Warne: IPL in SA wont be the same
                      
	Melbourne: Shane Warne said its a shame that the Indian Premier League (IPL) has had to be shifted to South Africa and felt it wont be the same in the rainbow country.         
	Warne, who led underdogs Rajasthan Royal to the title in the first edition, said it would not be possible for South Africa to match the frenzy that surrounded last years IPL.         
	Itll be nothing like if it was in India, and its a shame it cant be in India. It wont be the same as being in India, but hopefully the South African public will get behind it and turn up at the ground and make it a great spectacle, Warne told reporters here.         
	The organisers moved the second edition of the IPL to South Africa as its schedule clashed with the general elections in India.         
	Recalling the victory in the inaugural tournament, Warne said: To win it on the last ball last year as the underdogs, having been thrashed in our first game, was pretty special in front of 80,000 people.         
	Warne also said the shifting of the tournament has disturbed their planning for the eight-team event.         
	Weve done three months of planning about itineraries and practice matches and all sorts of things. We were all set to go. We started planning for England over the weekend and now were planning for South Africa as of yesterday (Wednesday), he said.

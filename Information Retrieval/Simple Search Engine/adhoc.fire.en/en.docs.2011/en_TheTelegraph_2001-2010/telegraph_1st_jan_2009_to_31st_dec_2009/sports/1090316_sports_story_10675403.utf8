  - Deodhar Trophy 
  - Finalists to be decided today in Cuttack
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            West Zone captain Wasim Jaffer during practice in Cuttack on Sunday. (PTI)                           
	Calcutta/Cuttack: East Zone will look to play safe and seal a final berth for the Deodhar Trophy when they cross swords with defending champions Central Zone in their last league match here on Monday.         
	An unbeaten century from Jamshedpur youngster Ishank Jaggi and superb performances from Wriddhiman Saha, Saurabh Tiwary and Natraj Behera took East to a 300-plus total to shatter North Zones hopes on Saturday. East earned a crucial bonus point from the win.         
	East, led by the talented Manoj Tiwary, are likely to retain the same side against the Mohammed Kaif-led side.         
	We dont want to do anything silly. The win with five points yesterday (Saturday) has given us a tremendous boost. Now we will play freely without any pressure, Tiwary told reporters on the eve of the match.         
	But we want to win tomorrow and in all departments. That is our main focus. The bonus point issue is only there at the back of our minds, the captain said.         
	It will be a battle between Jaggi and the talented wicketkeeper-batsman Naman Ojha who also scored a century, only to see his side go down against North in their first-round match.         
	But its the star-studded Central bowling that may give Tiwary something to worry about.         
	Boasting of three former India bowlers  R.P. Singh, Murali Kartik and Piyush Chawla  in their ranks, Central will have to win the match with a bonus point to make the final. East only need to deny Central the extra point.         
	Central might be a big name and the reigning champions, but we are not unduly worried. They are a better side on paper only. They had the same team in their earlier match but they lost.         
	Our batters did quite well. But I am a tad worried about our fast-bowling duo of (Ranadeb) Bose and (Ashok) Dinda. We discussed this in our team meeting and hopefully they will come good tomorrow, he said.         
	Tiwary further revealed that they might opt to chase after winning the toss on Monday to keep a tab on the net run-rate, which will be crucial in determining the finalist if East lose.         
	East opted to have a days rest on the eve of the match, while Central had nets in Bhubaneswar.

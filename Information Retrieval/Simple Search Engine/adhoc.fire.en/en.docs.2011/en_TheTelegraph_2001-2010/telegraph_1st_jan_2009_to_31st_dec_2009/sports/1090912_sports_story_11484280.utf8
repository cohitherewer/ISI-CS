    - Edmilson finds a shoulder to cry on in mentor Perreira             A STAFF REPORTER            Bhaichung Bhutia with Edmilson at the club ground on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: East Bengal are mulling drastic action against their Brazilian enfant terrible Edmilson. According to club secretary Kalyan Majumder, the club is awaiting a reply to the show cause notice served on the player after his on-the-field spat with coach Subhas Bhowmick and teamamate Soumik Dey on Thursday.         
	We are awaiting his reply. And when it comes (hopefully by Saturday) we will take necessary action. But one thing is for sure it will be very stringent, Majumder said on Friday.         
	Sources did not rule out giving the Brazilian a release order. But since Edmilson is already contracted with the club, East Bengal may find it difficult to give him the boot straightaway. They can always penalise him or take disciplinary action but releasing the player can pose problems.         
	What may act against Edmilson is the fact that the club has video evidence of Edmilson arguing with Bhowmick and subsequently hitting Dey when the defender tried to pacify him.         
	 The club is on a strong wicket. We may not have to pay him the contracted amount since it was an act of gross indiscipline, the source added. He can never go to Fifa seeking compensation, he said.         
	Edmilsons relation with Bhowmick soured during the clubs Myanmar trip when the Brazilian vented his ire after being substituted in one of the matches. Since then it went from bad to worse, a player who was on that trip said.         
	Edmilson is already out of the Durand Cup squad and the club signed Sebastian Omar on Friday. The Argentine and the rest of the team is expected to leave for Delhi on Monday.         
	The Brazilian though found a friend in Churchill Brothers coach Carlos Perreira. The veteran coach was instrumental in getting the striker to the red-and-gold brigade when he was with East Bengal. On Friday, he was visibly unhappy by the protgs antics.         
	It was sad. I felt very bad after reading what happened. He is from a good family and good human being.         
	 Only problem is he loses his cool too easily. After what happened on Thursday I dont think he will be able to continue with East Bengal. If there was a rule for four foreigners I would have defnitely signed him, Carlos said.         
	Carlos, in fact, had a meeting with Edmilson on Friday evening, including a counselling session. He wanted to come to the ground but I stopped him because that would have given the media enough fodder to write about, Carlos said laughing.

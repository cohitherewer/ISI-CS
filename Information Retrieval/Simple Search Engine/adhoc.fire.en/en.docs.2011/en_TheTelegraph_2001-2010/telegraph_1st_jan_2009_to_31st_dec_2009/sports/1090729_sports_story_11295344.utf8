                                                   First PGA title for Nathan
                      
	Oakville (Canada): Australian Nathan Green ended a gloomy week in brilliant style by beating South African Retief Goosen on the second hole of a sudden-death playoff to win the 100th Canadian Open on Monday.         
	After four days of torrential rain, thunderstorms and lightning forced the $5.1 million tournament to a Monday finish, the skies finally cleared over Glen Abbey where Green fended off a late challenge from Goosen.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harendra Singh is all for Brasa
                                                   Harendra Singh is all for Brasa
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Harendra Singh, the coach-in-charge of the national hockey team, Thursday said he would gladly vacate his chair were Jose Brasa of Spain to be appointed chief coach.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph on his return from a twin tour of Australia and New Zealand with the national team, Harendra said: I dont know when Brasa would be joining. The ad hoc committee has not informed me yet. But I shall have no problem with that since it will be for the betterment of Indian hockey.         
	A good foreign coach, according to Harendra, has become necessary for the Indian team. I am sure a leading coach like Brasa or Ric Charlesworth will be of great help for the improvement of Indian hockey.         
	Unfortunately, in India, anyone who has donned the national jersey thinks he is capable of coaching the national team. But in modern hockey, one does not need to be a great player to be a good coach. Top coaches like Maurits Hendricks or Roelant Oltmans were not big stars in their playing days, said Harendra.         
	Let us forget that we won eight gold medals in Olympics, Harendra said. Its time we accepted that we stand 11th in the rankings. At the moment, our aim should be to be among the first six.

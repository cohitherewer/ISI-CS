The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murray hopes for plenty of rain at Wimbledon
                                                   Murray hopes for plenty of rain at Wimbledon
                                Murray    
	Paris: While the British usually hope for hot, sunny days for the Wimbledon fortnight, Andy Murray is wishing for plenty of rain at his home Grand Slam.         
	With Centre Court unveiling a retractable roof at this years championships, which start on June 22, the showcourt can be transformed into an indoor arena at the first hint of a downpour.         
	When you play indoors, it does make a big difference to the atmosphere, Murray told a news conference after reaching the third round of the French Open on Wednesday.         
	Obviously there is no wind or anything around you. No sun... So it makes it a little bit easier to play.         
	I grew up playing indoors my whole life, so Ill be hoping that its raining more this year than in the past.         
	Of course, in the unlikely event one of his matches is not scheduled on Centre Court and it starts to rain, he may regret his wish while he sits in the locker room waiting for the showers to pass.         
	World No. 3 Murray needed a burst of aggression to survive a mid-match meltdown and beat Italian Potito Starace 6-3, 2-6, 7-5, 6-4 in the second round of the French Open on Wednesday.         
	I managed to turn it around by playing a little bit more aggressive. I got the ball deep into his backhand and came to the net quite a lot, the 22-year-old said.         
	The Scot saved two set points in the third set, snuffing out one with a powerful forehand winner.         
	In the next round Murray faces Serb Janko Tipsarevic I have nothing to lose, therefore I am not scared, Tipsarevic said. Ill rely (on the fact) that hes, in my opinion, still not 100 per cent comfortable on clay.

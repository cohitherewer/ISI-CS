                  Herschelle Gibbs in action against the Chennai Super Kings in Durban on Monday                     
	Durban: Herschelle Gibbs, who was adjudged Man of the Match for his unbeaten 69 that paved the way for their victory on Monday, said Adam Gilchrists presence at the other end took the pressure off his shoulders.         
	In Twenty20, we are not expected to get our eyes in. But with Gilly going after it right from the first ball, there was no pressure and I could relax, Gibbs said.         
	We tried to make the maximum use of the first six overs. With Gilly going so well, I didnt have much to do, he said.         
	Gilchrist also credited his bowlers for restricting the Chennai Super Kings to 165.         
	Chennai got off to a good start and I think we did well to pull them back. They looked like getting 180-190 but our bowlers just hung in.         
	RP Singh did cop some runs but he bowled an important last over and I think we did well, he said.         
	Gilchrist, however, admitted that he erred in not allowing Pragyan Ojha complete his full quota of four overs.         
	I think I made a mistake there. Ojha bowled two overs and took two important wickets (of Matthew Hayden and Mahendra Singh Dhoni) for just 11 runs. Maybe my mind got it wrong. He (Ojha) has done a great job in the tournament so far, he said.         
	Clearly unhappy with the lacklustre show of his bowlers, Dhoni said time was ripe to bring in some changes in the squad. The six-wicket defeat against the Deccan Chargers left the last years finalists in an unenviable position with just one win from their five outings and Dhoni pointed his accusing finger at the bowlers for the teams string of poor shows in the second edition of the Indian Premier League.         
	I think the bowlers are letting us down, a dejected Dhoni said after the match.         
	We really need to come up with some ideas, maybe a few other combinations and test our bench strength, Dhoni said.         
	With Gilchrist and Gibbs going great gun, Chennai bowlers had a forgettable outing.         
	Laxmipathy Balaji conceded 41 runs in 3.3 overs for his one wicket while Manpreet Gony gave away 20 runs in his only over, prompting Dhoni not to press him into service again.         
	Among others, Joginder Sharma conceded 14 runs in his only over, while Albie Morkel conceded 29 in his three wicket-less overs. Dhoni didnt spare the batsmen either and felt Chennai batters struggled in the middle overs. We are getting good starts but have been struggling in the middle overs, said Dhoni.

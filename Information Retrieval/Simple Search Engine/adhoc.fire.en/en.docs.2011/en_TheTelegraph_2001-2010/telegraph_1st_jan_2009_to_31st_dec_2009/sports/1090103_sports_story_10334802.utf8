                                                   Pak tour on: SLC
                      
	Karachi: Sri Lanka Cricket chief executive Duleep Mendis on Friday said there was no question of backing out of their tour of Pakistan but added that players will be consulted before finalising the itinerary.         
	Mendis also dismissed reports that the delay in finalisation of itinerary was due to Sri Lankan players being reluctant to tour Pakistan.         
	We have already confirmed to our Pakistani counterparts that we will be touring their country. We will definitely honour our commitment, Mendis told a television channel.         
	Meanwhile, the PCB has rubbished reports about a Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) involvement behind the delay in Sri Lankas confirmation of the tour.           (PTI)

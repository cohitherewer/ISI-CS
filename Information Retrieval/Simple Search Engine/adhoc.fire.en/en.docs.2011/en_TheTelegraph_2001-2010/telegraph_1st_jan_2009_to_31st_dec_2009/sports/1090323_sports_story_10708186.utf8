                                                   Kapil: Pity the players were not consulted
                      
	New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in Indias (BCCI) decision to shift the Indian Premier League (IPL) to another country Sunday evoked a mixed response from former cricketers, some of whom felt that the entire issue was messed up by the BCCI. Former England captain, Andrew Flintoff, expressed his disappointment at losing another chance to play in India. The following are what they had to say (alphabetically):         
	Chandu Borde: I am quite sure the BCCI and IPL officials must have taken the decision after taking into account a lot of factors and after a lot of deliberations. Considering the present circumstances, the players will be quite relieved to play outside India. Under the present circumstances, I appreciate the BCCI and the IPL for deciding to continue the game.         
	Kapil Dev: I would first take the players into confidence and address their concerns before deciding to shift any tournament that belonged to India. The tournament was intended to be held in India, therefore the administrators of the game should have first talked to the players before venturing to shift the tournament. Its a pity that players were not allowed to give their opinion on this matter.         
	Andrew Flintoff: Its a disappointing news because one of the big attractions for me about the IPL was playing in India. I love playing cricket in India, particularly limited-over cricket. Ive never played a Twenty20 match over there but I can imagine it would be an unbelievable experience because as a player, you dont get a chance very often to play in front of big crowds of 40,000 to 50,000 people. Its unfortunate but if we dont do that this year, then hopefully we can do it again next year.         
	Syed Kirmani: I think they (BCCI/IPL) did not want to take any risk due to tensions in the country. Ultimately, the show must go on and that has been decided by the IPL.         
	Erapalli Prasanna: If I were the BCCI president, I would have consulted the government of India much before the decision on the Lok Sabha election dates. Having not done that, I would have conceded to the government to cancel the IPL because the tournament has India in the title. The BCCI has messed it up.         
	Dilip Vengsarkar: The important thing is the safety of the players. If the government has apprehensions about their safety when polls are held, its advisable to move it out. If something happens (during the holding of the IPL in India as was planned) the government will be blamed.

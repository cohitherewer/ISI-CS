The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SL close in on clean sweep
                                                   SL close in on clean sweep
                            
	Colombo: Spinner Rangana Heraths four wickets carried Sri Lanka within sight of victory in the second Test against New Zealand and a 2-0 series sweep, as the tourists ended Saturdays Day IV on 182 for six.         
	With just four wickets in hand, the Black Caps must now bat out three full sessions to force a draw or score 312 more runs to pull off an improbable victory.         
	No team in Test history has successfully chased more than 418 runs to win in a fourth innings. The highest fourth innings score at Sinhalese Sports Club is 391 for four, scored by Sri Lanka against Pakistan last month.         
	Seamer Dammika Prasad brought the first breakthrough for the hosts in the second session, bowling Tim McIntosh for seven.         
	Herath entered the fray, snaring Martin Guptill (28) in his first ball of the innings, caught by wicket-keeper Prasanna Jayawardena. He later forced a catch off Ross Taylor (27) to Mahela Jayawardene at first slip and trapped top-scorer Daniel Flynn leg before for 50.         
	He also trapped Jesse Ryder lbw for 38 to finish with four for 73. Flynn faced 93 balls and hit six boundaries for his fourth Test half-century. Brendon McCullum (13) continued his poor run with the bat, bowled by Muttiah Muralidharan.         
	Jacob Oram (7) and skipper Daniel Vattori (5) were the not out batsmen to resume Sunday.         
	Earlier Sri Lanka declared their second innings on 311 for five, helped largely by an imperious century from skipper Kumar Sangakkara.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Steve: India cant blame fatigue for ouster
                                                   Steve: India cant blame fatigue for ouster
                      
	New Delhi: Former Australia captain Steve Waugh Tuesday refused to agree with India coach Gary Kirsten in holding fatigue responsible for Indias early ouster from the Twenty20 World Cup and said some basic errors by Mahendra Singh Dhonis men was the cause of the debacle.         
	Everyone played the IPL, I think India were more affected by it but you need to appreciate Gary for his honesty, he said what he felt, Waugh said.         
	But it is not a valid excuse in my mind because every one is a professional player and may be India failed to lift themselves for the event. So I dont think fatigue is an issue.         
	It is the nature of Twenty20. Its unpredictable its a game of a couple of hours and if you are not on the game and sharp enough you make mistakes... and India bowled a few wides, Harbhajan bowled well but there were some uncharacteristic deliveries in the last overs and Yuvraj also made a fielding mistake.         
	So you look back and find these are the things which makes the difference between winning and losing. They needed to do these little things right all the time, he added.         
	Waugh, however, backed Dhoni and said he has done well in the role of captain.         
	I would stick with Dhoni as captain. When you win you are fantastic and when you lose you are hopeless. But the reality is that it is somewhere in between. He cant go out there and take all the catches. All captains have a role and I dont think there is too much wrong in there, Waugh said.         
	Asked if he would like to step into Kirstens shoes if India were to look for a new coach after six months, Waugh said he would like to see the South African stay a little longer.         
	It is the toughest job in the world and Gary is doing a good job and I would like to see Gary last a little longer, Waugh said.         
	With the World Cup moving into the semi-final stage, Waugh felt South Africa have the maximum chance of winning the title.         
	If I have to pick one, I feel it has to be South Africa, he said.         
	Waugh also lashed out at temperamental all-rounder Andrew Symonds.         
	Symonds has been a shame on Australian cricket. He is a good cricketer and has been a match-winner for us but he has some issues, which need to be sorted out, he said.

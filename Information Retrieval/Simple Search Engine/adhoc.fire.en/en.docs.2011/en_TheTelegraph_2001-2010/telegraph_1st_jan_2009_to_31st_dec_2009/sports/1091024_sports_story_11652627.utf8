The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lee powers NSW to title
                                                     Lee powers NSW to title
                  NSW Blues players celebrate with the Champions League T20 trophy in Hyderabad on Friday                     
	Hyderabad: New South Wales were crowned the inaugural Champions League Twenty20 champions after they snapped Trinidad amp; Tobagos fairytale campaign with a 41-run victory in the final on Friday.         
	It was a battle between Caribbean flair and Australian professionalism, and in the end, NSW had the last laugh with Brett Lee as their star performer.         
	Put into bat, NSW fumbled and slumped to 83 for six in the 12th over before finding a messiah in Lee, whose whirlwind 48 off 31 balls, along with Steven Smiths 33, guided them to 159 for nine. T amp;Ts chase never gathered momentum and Kieron Pollards (26 off 15 balls) last ditch attempt was not enough as the Caribbeans folded up for 118 in 15.5 overs.         
	After his batting heroics, Lee was in the thick of action again, claiming two quick wickets to reduce T amp;T to 21 for three in the first 14 balls. Lees second delivery castled Wiliam Perkins and the pacer returned to catch Lendl Simmons off his own bowling in the next over.         
	David Warner and Phil Hughes have been key to New South Wales success in the tournament so far but the left-handed opening pair, for once, proved they too had feet of clay. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ranty nets a double
                                                   Ranty nets a double
                      
	Margao: Two second-half strikes by Ranty Martins enabled Dempo to beat Mahindra United 3-2 in an I-league match at the Nehru Stadium, here on Monday.         
	Mahindra jolted Dempo as early as in the 24th second. Steven Dias sent a curling cross into the box which defender John Dias failed to intercept and Arata Izumi, who was lurking nearby, slammed the ball in.         
	Dempos persistent efforts bore fruit in stoppage time when a move between Beto and Anthony Pereira saw the former hitting the bulls eye. The defending champions took the lead a minute after the change of ends. Peter Carvalhos pass found an unmarked Ranty who made no mistake in hitting the back of the net.         
	Desperate to get at least a point, Mahindra coach Derrick Pereira went for three substitutions, bringing in K Ajayan, Mohammed Rafi and Sunil Kumar in place of NP Pradeep, Arata Izumi and Justine Stephen. The move paid off as Mahindra equalised in the 66th minute. Mohammed Rafi laid a pass to Edeh Chidi, who in turn relayed the ball to Sushil Singh who made it 2-2.         
	Dempo scored the winner in the 88th minute when a Ranty free-kick crashed into the net giving Roy Choudhury hardly any chance to move.           (PTI)

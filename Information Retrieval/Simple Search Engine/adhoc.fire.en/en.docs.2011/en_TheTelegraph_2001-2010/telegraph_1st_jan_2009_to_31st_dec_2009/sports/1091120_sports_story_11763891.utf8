            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Ahmedabad: Until they returned to the dressing room, the Jayawardenes  Mahela and Prasanna  werent aware that they had rewritten the world record for the sixth wicket stand.         
	The pair added 351 runs in 387 minutes off 592 balls to improve on the 346 set by Don Bradman and Jack Fingleton in Melbourne during the 1936-37 Ashes.         
	I wasnt aware of any record Even Mahela had no clue. Only after we returned to the dressing room did manager Brendon Kuruppu mention the record, Prasanna said at a media conference.         
	We had a plan and played to the that We had the team objective in mind and concentrated on playing session by session, he added.         
	What was his plan when he went out to bat? I was relaxed. Im happy to have made a contribution. I knew that I needed to get runs to secure my position. That was the objective.         
	Prasanna thinks Sri Lanka have a good chance of taking a 1-0 lead in the series.         
	Weve got a good lead. Weve got to do the basics right and not panic. If we can create some pressure on the Indian middle-order, things will fall into place.         
	The wicket is turning and there is a little bit of bounce. We need to bowl in the right areas Weve got a good chance.

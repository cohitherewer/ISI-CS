                                                   Indians falter in chase as Afridi spins a web
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Shahid Afridi spun a web as India struggled in their chase of 303 in the Champions Trophy encounter against Pakistan in Centurion on Saturday.         
	The off-spinner dismissed Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni in consecutive overs to reduce India to 143 for four in 26 overs. Rahul Dravid was batting on 40 from 62 balls along with Suresh Raina on 3.         
	A charged-up Gautam Gambhir gave India a rollicking start, but his first error, a lazy piece of running, let to his downfall. Gambhirs 46-ball 57 had taken India to 90 for 1 in the 14th over and it seemed Sachin Tendulkars early dismissal  caught behind off Mohammed Aamer for 8  would have no impact.         
	But Afridi put the Indians in a spot.         
	Earlier, Shoaib Maliks flamboyant 128 and Mohammed Yousufs gritty 87 helped Pakistan overcome initial jitters to post a formidable 302 for nine in their 50 overs.         
	Pakistan exploded in the second half of their innings with Malik and Yousuf sharing a 188-ball 206-run stand for the fourth wicket after they were reduced to 65 for three in the 15th over.         
	Ashish Nehra (4/55), who dismissed Imran Nazir, Kamran Akmal, Yousuf and Umar Akmal, was the pick of the Indian bowlers. Harbhajan Singh, the lone spinner in the Indian ranks, was wayward in his ten overs, but his late introduction could be the reason behind him giving away 71 runs.         
	Pakistan accelerated in the later stages  they scored 163 in the final 19 overs and, in the process, made a mockery of the view that middle overs in ODIs have become boring.         
	While Harbhajan continued his poor record against Pakistan, Malik improved on his already strong record against the archrivals  four of his seven centuries have now come against India, and his average of 52.24 against India is in stark contrast to his 35.27 overall.         
	Yousuf and Malik batted through the crucial phase showing superb discipline and anticipation. The initial part though was spent in nudges and pushes.         
	Once they came through the consolidation phase, during which the first boundary came after 65 balls, they forced the Indian bowling into submission with imaginative strokeplaying.         
	Malik was at his dominating best after playing sheet anchor in the early part. The former Pakistan captain took 81 balls to score his fifty but later accelerated to reach his hundred off 108 balls, hitting 13 fours. Sixty of those runs were scored between third man and point.         
	Malik opened up after the 30th over taking three boundaries off one Ishant Sharma over, and then back-to-back fours off Yusuf Pathan. Pakistan recovered from 108 for three in 25 overs to reach 217 for three in the 40th over to fold at 302.         
	Malik was dismissed in the penultimate over for 128 off 126 balls (16x4) but not before he had spoiled Nehras otherwise impressive figures. That the last five overs were batting Powerplay also helped.         
	Yousuf was not exactly slow at the other end. His boundaries through point and over extra cover, both off R.P. Singh, were a treat to watch. But he missed a well-deserved century by 13 runs after being done in by a slower one from Nehra.         
	Despite a two-run last over from Ishant, Pakistan managed 41 in the last five, setting India a target two runs more than has ever been chased in Centurion.         
	Indias pacers seemed to have put together a remarkable reply to the openers onslaught when they reduced Pakistan from 51 for 1 in seven overs to 65 for 3 in 15. The first seven overs saw nine smashing boundaries, the next eight, none.         
	Imran Nazir and Kamran Akmal got Pakistan off to a brisk start, reaching 28 in four overs, but once Nehra removed Nazir, Pakistan found the going tough. Akmal and Younis Khan fell in quick succession as India tried to grab the initiative.         
	Nazir, who scored 20 off 17 balls with four boundaries, top edged a pull and Harbhajan running in from mid-on took a comfortable catch.         
	Akmal was the next to fall as he dragged a Nehra delivery on to his stumps. Akmal, who went for a forcing shot on the off side, didnt pick the length properly this time. Akmal was looking pretty solid out there and his dismissal put skids on the momentum.         
	Younis survived a caught and bowled chance on 14 off RP. The Uttar Pradesh pacer, though, made amends in the next over, having the Pakistan captain caught behind for 20.         
	Coming round the wicket, RP got the ball to straighten a bit outside the off. Younis, who was nowhere close to the ball, lunged at it and stabbed an outer edge to Dhoni.         
	On a warm day and a dry Centurion pitch Younis chose to bat first in Pakistans first international match against India in close to a year and a half. The crucial match is being played on the same strip that helped the spin of Ajantha Mendis and Roelof van der Merwe in the first two matches.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Strong start by Bangla
                                                   Full point for India       A CORRESPONDENT                      Defending champions India set neighbours Bangladesh a steep target of 181 to win in their first match of the ICC World Twenty20 on Saturday. Yuvraj Singh played a blinder mdash; 41 off 18 balls mdash; to boost India to the eventual total after captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni decided to bat on winning the toss.
    Chasing 181, Bangladesh were 48 for one after five overs. Junaid Siddique (28) and Mohammed Ashraful (5) were at the crease.
    Yuvraj hit four sixes and three boundaries and provided the fireworks that India desperately needed towards the end. Openers Gautam Gambhir and Rohit Sharma also contributed with a solid half-century opening partnership.
  Yuvraj hit off-spinner Naeem Islam for three huge sixes in the 17th over, garnering 19 runs in that over. The next over from pacer Rubel Hossain went for 17, with Yuvraj hitting a six and two boundaries.
    He fell in the next over, caught at long-off, trying to hit Shahadat Hossain out of the ground.
    The Indians scored 67 off the last five overs. At one stage the men in blue looked destined for a total around the 150-run mark, pegged back by Mohammed Ashraful rsquo;s intelligent field-placing and continuous shuffling of the bowlers.
  Irfan faced the last three deliveries of the innings and picked up 11 runs with a six and a boundary.
    The openers provided a brilliant platform for the big-hitters. Rohit (36 off 23 balls) and Gambhir brought up 50 in only 5.2 overs, with the righthander being the more attacking of the two.
    Rohit initially looked a bit rusty, mis-hitting the ball on a couple of occasions but found his feet and timing as his innings progressed. He hit three boundaries and two sixes during his knock.
    After playing some flowing drives and flicks off the pacers, the stylish right-hander perished once Mohammed Ashraful brought on Shakib Al Hasan to bowl left-arm spin.
    Al Hasan, currently the No. 1 all-rounder in the ICC ODI rankings, drew Rohit out on his first ball and beat him in flight. But wicket-keeper Mushfiqur Rahim made a mess of the stumping chance. 
    The left-arm spinner didn rsquo;t need any help on the very next ball as Rohit was clean bowled, trying a wild slog across the line.
    The Indians managed 54 off the first six overs of Power-play, at a run-rate of nine. At the half-way stage, the Indians were at 76 for the loss of one wicket.
    The introduction of the spinners pegged back India rsquo;s run-rate.
    Al Hasan (1/24) was the pick of the Bangladesh bowlers. The Indian batsmen failed to accelerate against him as he constantly varied his pace and length to keep the run-rate under check.
    Gambhir rsquo;s knock (50 off 46 balls) lacked his usual flow and he failed to hit the spinners at will on Saturday. 
    After surviving a dropped chance at point (Raqibul Hossain was the fielder) early on in his innings, Gambhir probably tried to hit the ball too hard and failed to find his placement.
    He played second fiddle during the 59-run stand with Rohit for the opening wicket and then combined with Dhoni in adding 53 runs for the second wicket. 
    He perished trying to hit off-spinner Naeem Islam inside out over the covers.
  Captain Dhoni kept the scoreboard ticking with a sedate innings of 26 off 21 balls, but he too looked bogged down during his knock. 
    He was clean bowled by Islam, playing down the wrong line after dancing down the wicket.

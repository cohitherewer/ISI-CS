	Sporting Clube de Goa came from behind to hold Chirag United to a 1-1 draw in an I-League match at the Nehru Stadium, here on Monday. The visitors took the lead in the 79th minute through Edmilson from a penalty. Sporting fought back and equalised through Nathaniel Amos header three minutes later.         
	Both the teams started cautiously as they tried to gauge each others strength.         
	Chirag controlled the midfield, had more of the exchanges and scoring chances. They had the first opportunity in the 18th minute when a move between Denson Devdas and Edmilson saw the latter release the ball to Joshimar who shot out.         
	Meanwhile, in Shillong Lajong FC played a goalless draw with Salgaocar.         
	Though the Goan outfit dominated the match, the day did not belong to them as their best efforts failed to yield the desired result.         
	Salgaocar foreign recruit Ekene Ikenwa missed the target twice in either halves. Avneet Singh Shergill, too, squandered an opportunity off a goalmouth melee in the 17th minute.         
	Unlike their match against Mohun Bagan, the hosts lacked coordination and finishing. The forward line looked unsettled with Nepalease new recruit Anil Gurung finding hardly any support upfront.         
	Though Lajong coach Stanley Rozario rung in changes  Samson R in place of James Gbillee being one of those  the ploy hardly had any effect.

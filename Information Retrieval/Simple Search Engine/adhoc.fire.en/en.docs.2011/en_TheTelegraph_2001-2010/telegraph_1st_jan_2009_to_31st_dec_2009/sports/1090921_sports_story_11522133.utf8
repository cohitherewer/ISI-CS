The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India regain No. 2 spot
                                                   India regain No. 2 spot
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Australia were unable to complete an unprecedented 7-0 clean sweep over England on Sunday as Ricky Pontings side went down by four wickets in the final ODI of the series in Durham.         
	As a result, Australia dropped to third spot in the ICC one-day rankings while South Africa regained the No. 1 position.         
	India moved up from third position to second but with just two ratings points separating those three sides. There could be more chopping and changing over the next couple of weeks as the top eight-ranked sides battle for the ICC Champions Trophy in South Africa.         
	England move back into sixth place, ahead of New Zealand, in the team rankings. A reasonable performance in the ICC Champions Trophy could see Andrew Strausss men climb to as high as fourth place as they are now just four ratings points behind Pakistan.         
	TEAMS         
	1. South Africa (127 pts); 2. India (126); 3. Australia (125); 4. Pakistan (109); 5. Sri Lanka (108); 6. England (105); 7. New Zealand (105); 8. West Indies (78); 9. Bangladesh (55); 10. Zimbabwe (26); 11. Ireland (25); 12. Kenya (0).

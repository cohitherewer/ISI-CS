	Singapore: Renaults French novice driver Romain Grosjean brought Singapore Grand Prix first practice to a halt by crashing in the same place Nelson Piquet deliberately crashed in the race-fixing scam orchestrated by Flavio Briatore and chief engineer Pat Symonds in 2008.         
	Renault team members held their heads in their hands as the unwelcome reminder of last years deception was played out before them.         
	Grosjean lost control on turn 17 of the Circuit and slammed into the opposite wall.         
	Grosjean, who replaced Piquet in August and was passed fit only on Friday morning after feeling unwell on Thursday, had completed nine laps when he crashed.         
	He has not previously raced at the track.         
	Piquet escaped punishment after being granted immunity in exchange for his whistle blowing, but is without a team.         
	The track was cleared nine minutes after the crash and practice resumed with 36 minutes remaining.         
	The Brawn GP pair of Rubens Barrichello and Jenson Button set the quickest times in the truncated opening practice session.         
	Barrichello set a best time of 1 minute, 50.179 seconds, almost two tenths of a second ahead of Button.                 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

                                                   NZ find going tough
                      
	Colombo: New Zealand struggled to 159 for five on the second day of the second and final Test Thursday, trailing Sri Lanka by 257 runs after Thilan Samaraweeras century had put the hosts in command.         
	Ross Taylor was providing lone resistance for the visitors at the close, having compiled 70 not out from 118 balls. Wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum was unbeaten on five.         
	Left-armer Thilan Thushara continued his fine form by taking two for 37 for Sri Lanka.         
	Earlier, Samaraweera thumped 143 as Lanka totalled 416 in their first innings despite losing their last five wickets for 27 runs. He shared a 180-run partnership for the fourth wicket with Mahela Jayawardene (92). The centurion batted for more than six hours, facing 240 deliveries and hitting 17 fours and a six as he made his second hundred of the series.         
	New Zealand fought back in the afternoon session, off-spinner Jeetan Patel recovering from an expensive start to finish with four for 78.         
	The hosts, 1-0 up in the series, had started the day on 262 for three.         
	Jayawardene scored 92 in 234 balls before being caught behind off seamer Iain Brien.         
	Chamara Kapugedera, replacing injured all-rounder Angelo Mathews, then stroked 35 before lofting a catch off Patel.         
	After lunch, wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene (17) top-edged a hook and Samaraweera was quickly running out of partners when he was finally caught behind off Patel.(REUTERS)

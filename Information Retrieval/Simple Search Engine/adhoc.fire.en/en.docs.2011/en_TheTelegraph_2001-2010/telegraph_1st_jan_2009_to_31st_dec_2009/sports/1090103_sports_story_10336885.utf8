	Asked to identify the problems plaguing Australian, Buchanan said: Its the responsibility of the Australian selectors and the players.         
	He, however, appeared hopeful of a quick revival. I feel they will soon be back where they were, Buchanan remarked.

	Elaborating on his plans for the ensuing IPL, Buchanan said: Lots of thoughts are there We need to sit together and chalk it out         
	Apart from international players, wed also like to stress on local talent.

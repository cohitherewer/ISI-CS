                                                     Sachins form good sign: Dhoni 
            A CORRESPONDENT            Sachin Tendulkar in Wellington on Friday                           
	Wellington: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni expressed relief with Sachin Tendulkars return to form in the abandoned second ODI against New Zealand Friday. He said the team was already in a good position and if it were a 50-over game, they would have got a decent score.         
	The match was abandoned when the rain stopped play for the third time with India on 188 for four in 28.4 overs. Dhoni was unbeaten on 23 while Suresh Raina was not out on 13.         
	[Meanwhile, off-spinner Jeetan Patel has been called to the New Zealand squad as cover for Daniel Vettori, who is expecting the birth of his first child.]               
	The following are excerpts         
	If India were heading towards a winning total         
	I dont know whether we would have won the game or not but we were definitely in a good position. If it was a 50-over game, we would have got a decent score. I cant say how much we would have got but the kind of start we got, we would have got a par plus score. So it would have been a tough target as even though the ground is not very big. Its not that you can go after the spinners each and every time.         
	If batting first is the right decision when there is a possibility of rain         
	I feel its a gamble. If its a 50-over game, you win the toss and youre not sure how much it would rain. If you lose 8, 10 or 15 overs, the side which has batted first has a bit of advantage. But if the side batting second are given a target in 20 overs, it becomes very easy. For New Zealand today (Friday), if it was a 20-over game, they would have required around 166-odd runs but if it was a 28-over game, they would have needed about 217-odd runs.         
	If the stop-start affair made it hard to concentrate         
	We were in and out of the field. But its uncontrollable. You cant do anything unless you have an indoor stadium. I think its tough for the batsmen who are in, specially when it rains on and off, every time he has to set himself up before going for the big strokes. I am happy the batsmen played well. In whatever limited opportunities they got, they scored runs.         
	On Sachin Tendulkars innings         
	Its a pleasure watching him score runs, wherever he scores. It was really good to see him among runs and thats definitely a good sign for our side. If you can get those runs at the top of the order, the men in the middle order can just play their natural game.         
	On Ishants availability for the third ODI         
	He bowled a bit but I think he will take a few more days rest, at least two more days. It would be difficult for him to make it to the Christchurch match.         
	His plans for Christchurch         
	Its difficult to predict the weather out there. It was supposed to rain in the afternoon today (Friday), at about 2 clock, but it didnt. It rained throughout the evening. Because of the strong wind, I think the weather changes a lot you cant really say much, but of course, you wouldnt want a shorter version in Christchurch. If the batsmen go after the bowlers, theres not much territory to defend. You know there are short square boundaries. It is tough for the bowlers and hopefully, if you have a full 50-over game, the bowlers will be slightly relaxed.         
	Whichever bowler has bowled one change, has struggled a bit because the wickets are very helpful for the seamers but if you are one change, its the toughest job. Even in the New Zealand side, you see the one change bowler always goes for runs. Its a very difficult position for a fast bowler to bowl and the 10 extra overs of Powerplay are not helping them.

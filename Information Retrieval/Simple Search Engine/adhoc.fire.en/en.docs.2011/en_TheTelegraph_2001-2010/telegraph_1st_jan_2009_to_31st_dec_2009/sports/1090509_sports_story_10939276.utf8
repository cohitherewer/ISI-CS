The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England take a 1-0 lead
                                                     England take a 1-0 lead
                  Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann                     
	London: England beat the West Indies by 10 wickets on Friday, winning the opening Test of a series for the first time in 15 attempts. England reached the winning target of 32 after tea on the third day at Lords, having bowled out the West Indies for 152 and 256 after their first innings of 377.         
	Led by Ravi Boparas 143 and debutant Graham Onions five for 38 in the first innings and Graeme Swanns three wickets in each innings, England won an opening Test for the first time since beating Bangladesh at Lords in 2005 by an innings and 261 runs.         
	The second and final Test starts on Thursday at Chester-le-Street as England attempt to avenge their 1-0 loss at the West Indies in a five-match series earlier this year.         
	The West Indies Brendan Nash scored 81 and put on 134 with Denesh Ramdin (61) for the seventh wicket to ensure England had to bat again, but Alastair Cook and Andrew Strauss each hit 14 not out to take the hosts to victory.

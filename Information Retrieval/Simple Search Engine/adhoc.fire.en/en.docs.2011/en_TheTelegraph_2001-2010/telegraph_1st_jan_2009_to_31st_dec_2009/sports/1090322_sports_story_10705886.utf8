	Gurgaon: Chapchai Nirat of Thailand emerged runaway victor in the SAIL Open on Saturday when he stormed home with a record-breaking performance at the sprawling Classic Golf Resort. The hard-hitting Thai, who was in magical form throughout the four days of the $300,000 event, set an awe-inspiring new 72-hole record on the Asian Tour by closing with a total of 32-under 256.         
	So absolute was Nirats domination that he scored an 11-stroke victory over Gaganjeet Bhullar and Richard Moir of Australia, who shared the second spot, after a highly impressive five-under 67 on the final day of the meet. Bhullar, who started the day eight shots behind Nirat, had to settle for a share of the second place when he posted a 70 to tie with Moir on 267.         
	Chapchai was simply too good, conceded Bhullar later. He just played some fabulous golf through the week. He has been hitting too well and doesnt seem to feel any pressure, Bhullar added. However, Bhullars hopes of a breakthrough on the closing day faded away when he could manage only four birdies against two bogeys.         
	Second-placed Moir said: Its an outstanding effort by Chapchai. I dont have any words, its unreal. His monstrous drives made it seem like hes playing on a par-three course. Nirat said that he played his natural golf and never for a moment thought about the record. My target was just to win and I did not think of the record. So, there was no pressure during the final birdie putt, which helped me break the record.         
	I was confident from the start today, Nirat added. This win has given me a lot of confidence and I think I will now be able to take this momentum forward and probably win two or three more tournaments this year.         
	Thailands Thammanoon Srirot, South Africas Keith Horne and New Zealands Mark Purser were tied fourth on matching 269s while Australias Chris Gaunt and Thailands Wisut Artjanawat ended their Indian campaign at tied-seventh on 270.         
	Calcutta pro S.S.P. Chowrasia (276) had yet another disappointing tournament as he finished joint 27th. Another title aspirant, Jyoti Randhawa (278) finished joint 34th with four others included among whom were Rahil Gangjee and Gaurav Ghei.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi: Dempo coach Armando Colaco has made all arrangements to form the countrys first ever coaches association, motivated, to an extent, by last weeks sacking of Viswas Gaonkar as the Sporting Clube de Goa coach.         
	When Manoranjan Bhattacharya and Stanley Rozario were fired by East Bengal early in the season, no professional coach in Calcutta had protested against the manner in which the two had been shown the door, but Gaonkars sacking, it seems, has created quite a storm.         
	Ive already had a talk with all the coaches in Goa. Our association will be formed next week, the Dempo coach told The Telegraph.         
	Armandowas particularly irked by the manner in which coaches are being regularly thrown out by the I-League clubs.         
	No one should be allowed to use the coaches as doormats, Armando said. The club officials are changing coaches the way they change their shirts. It has to be stopped.         
	The association, when formed, would ask the clubs to have a written contract with the coaches.         
	The contract should be for a minimum of one season. You cannot ask someone to pack his bags in the middle of the night. Thats unfair, the Dempo coach said.

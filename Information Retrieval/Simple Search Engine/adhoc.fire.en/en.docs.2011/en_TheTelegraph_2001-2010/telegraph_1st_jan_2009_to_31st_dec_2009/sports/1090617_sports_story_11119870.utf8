	Pretoria: Guiseppe Rossi set aside the mixed emotions of playing against the country of his birth to inspire Italy to a 3-1 win over the US in Confederations Cup Group B on Monday.         
	The America-born striker fired home a stunning long-range equaliser just 60 seconds after coming on as a 57th-minute substitute and confirmed Italys triumph with another goal in stoppage time.         
	Midfielder Daniel de Rossi banished bitter memories of his last encounter against the Americans with a spectacular shot in the 72nd minute as the Italians swamped their 10-man opponents in the second half.         
	The Americans had taken the lead just before the interval through a Landon Donovan penalty but were fighting a rearguard action after midfielder Ricardo Clark was sent off in the 33rd minute.         
	Fifa rejects complaint         
	Fifa has rejected an Egyptian complaint related to the decision-making process that gave Brazil a late penalty and a 4-3 win at the Confederations Cup, reports AP from Johannesburg. Egypt defender Ahmed Al Muhamadi was red-carded for using his right arm to stop a goal-bound shot on the line, and Kaka converted the resulting penalty Monday in Bloemfontein.         
	The Egyptians later claimed that the fourth official used a television replay to make the call. (Agencies)

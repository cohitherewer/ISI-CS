	Kimberley: Deccan Chargers relied on a late batting assault by Dwayne Smith (47) and then a three-wicket haul by Rohit Sharma to thump the Rajasthan Royals by 53 runs in their Indian Premier League (IPL) Monday.         
	Electing to bat, the Deccan outfit first rattled up a challenging 166 for seven and then bundled out the Shane Warne-led side for 113 in 19.3 overs.         
	Rohit returned with figures of three for 12, after Chaminda Vaas rocked the Rajasthan Royals run chase with two early wickets at the De Beers Diamond Oval. RP Singh and Pragyan Ojha chipped in with a wicket apiece.         
	With the win, their sixth from 10 outings, Deccan jumped to third spot in the points table with 12 points pushing down Rajasthan to the fourth (11 points from 11 matches).         
	Chasing a difficult 167 for a win, Rajasthan were outplayed in all departments by Adam Gilchrist and his men. They withered against a disciplined Deccan bowling with none of their batsmen, except for Swapnil Asnodkar (44), contributing much. By the 10th over, they were 59 losing three wickets and virtually ended their run chase by the 15th over reaching 96 for six.         
	Opener Graeme Smith (1) was hit by Vaas first delivery of the innings high on the pads but the umpire raised his dreaded finger to the dismay of Rajasthan camp. Vaas, who was playing his first IPL match this season, then dismissed Lee Carseldine (8), stumped by Adam Gilchrist to reduce Rajasthan to 19 for two.         
	Deccan tightened the screw after strategy break getting Naman Ojha (16) run out from a remarkable fielding by Ravi Teja from backward point.         
	Needing more than 10 an over after the halfway mark, Rajasthan tried to accelerate the innings and in the process Yusuf Pathan (6) was out in the 12th over. This was compounded by the run out of Swapnil Asnodkar following a terrible mix-up with Ravindra Jadeja (19 not out).         
	A clean up of Abhishek Rauts (1) timbers by Rohit saw the required run-rate shooting up to over 15 an over. And Morne Morkel (8), Shane Warne (0), Siddarth Trivedi (1) and Munaf Patel (4) ended up trying to do the impossible.         
	Earlier, Deccan too struggled to score against a disciplined Rajasthan bowling attack, losing wickets at regular intervals before Dwayne Smith lifted them to 166 for seven with a 32-ball 47 which had four sixes in it.         
	Rajasthan bowlers did not allow the Deccan batsmen to settle down for any substantial partnership before the Smith heroics. Yusuf was the most successful Rajasthan bowler with three for 34 from his four overs while Ravindra Jadeja bagged two wickets for 26 runs.         
	Smith, who came in after Rohit (9), was quite initially but opened up towards the end of the innings, taking his side from 108 in the 15th over to 166 for seven before he was out to Yusuf in the last over.         
	He shared a 29-ball 37 with Vaas (20) for the fifth wicket and a quick-fire 35 from just 14 balls with Venugopal Rao (12) for the sixth wicket including 17 runs in the 18th over bowled by Trivedi.         
	Andrew Symonds (30) and Tirumalasetti Suman (29) were the other notable contributors for the Deccan Chargers.         
	Captain Adam Gilchrist was the first to go for 10 in the fourth over after facing 11 balls. The retired Australian, who opened account with a six off Morne Morkel, was lbw to Yusuf.         
	Two overs later, Suman fell for 29, holing out to Carseldine near the boundary after hitting three fours and a six in his 19-ball innings before leaving his side to 42 for two.         
	Sensing a chance to tighten the screw on the Deccan side, Warne came in a changed bowler in the seventh over.         
	Warne got the turn but Symonds smote him for a huge six. But, pressure piled on Symonds as Rohit fell, stumped by Naman Ojha for nine in the 10th over.           (PTI)

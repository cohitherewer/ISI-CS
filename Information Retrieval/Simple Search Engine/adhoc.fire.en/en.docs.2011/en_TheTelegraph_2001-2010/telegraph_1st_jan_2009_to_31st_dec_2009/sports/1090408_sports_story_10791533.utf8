                                                   India stay at No. 3
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India lost a chance to keep up the pressure on South Africa, team No.2 in the International Cricket Council (ICC) Test rankings, when rain forced a draw in the third and final Test in Wellington Tuesday.         
	Victory in the third Test would have given India a 2-0 series triumph that would have seen Mahendra Singh Dhonis boys retain the 118 ratings points they had carried into the three-match rubber against the Black Caps.         
	But the draw in Wellington means India have 117 ratings points, two short of South Africas 119 and 11 behind leaders Australia who have 128 ratings points.         
	India had started the series with a difference of 37 ratings points relative to eighth-placed New Zealand and this gap meant they were expected to win the series convincingly. As such, because the rankings are weighted to reflect this difference, failure to win comfortably meant India dropped a point.         
	For their part, New Zealand have gained a ratings point to climb to 82 points but the Black Caps still lie eighth, seven points behind the West Indies.         
	Rankings         
	1. Australia 128; 2. South Africa 119; 3. India 117; 4. Sri Lanka 108; 5. Pakistan 100; 6. England 98; 7. West Indies 89; 8. New Zealand 82 ; 9. Bangladesh 0

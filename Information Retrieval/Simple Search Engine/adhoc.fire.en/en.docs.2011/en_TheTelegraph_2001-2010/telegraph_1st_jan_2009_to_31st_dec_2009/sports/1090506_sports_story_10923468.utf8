	Durban: The Rajasthan Royals rode on Graeme Smith and Naman Ojhas blazing fifties and debutant pacer Amit Singhs sensational bowling to trounce the Kings XI Punjab by a massive 78 runs in an IPL League match here on Tuesday.         
	Put into bat, Smith (77) and Ojhas (68) scintillating batting helped the Royals post the highest total of this edition of the IPL  211 for four  before restricting Punjab to 133 for eight. Smith and Ojha shared a 135-run stand for the opening wicket, which is so far the biggest partnership of the event.         
	Chasing the mammoth total, the Kings XI never looked in hunt and lost half their side with just 39 runs on the board by the eighth over.         
	Skipper Yuvraj Singh (48) stood tall among the ruins and was the only Punjab batsman to put up some resistance in a contest that was unexpectedly lop-sided. Yuvrajs knock comprised three fours and an equal number of sixes.         
	Punjabs demolition was initiated by Amit Sigh who struck with the first and the last ball of his opening over to leave Punjab at two for two. The 27-year-old ended the game with dream figures of three for nine in four overs.         
	Amit first induced an edge from Sunny Sohal (0), whose mishit landed safely with Shane Warne at slip. Karan Goel (1) became his next victim while trying to clear the deep square leg boundary. The ball soared in the air for a while before Shane Harwood caught it safely. Amit later picked up Yuvrajs wicket when the Punjab skipper hit a short delivery to Harwood at square leg.         
	Punjab were dealt a massive blow when Simon Katich was castled by Siddharth Trivedi off the last ball of his opening over. Katich (10) attempted to smash a yorker but only managed an inside edge that uprooted his off-stump and left Punjab reeling at 25 for three in the fourth over.         
	Kumar Sangakkara (10) didnt last long either, stumped by Ojha off a Yusuf Pathan delivery. Mahela Jayawardene (9) followed him to the dug-out, departing after hitting a six in the eighth over. Jayawardene was dismissed by Harwood after the Sri Lankan cut a short delivery only to be caught by Trivedi at third man. The rest of the Punjab line-up failed to put up a fight as they succumbed to the massive loss.         
	Earlier in the match, Rajasthan were off to their best start of the event, making 92 runs in their 10 overs before the strategy break.         
	Playing only his second IPL match, Ojha was sent in to open the innings with Smith and the 25-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman justified the move with his knock.         
	Smith, out of sorts so far in the event, was cautious at start but soon cut loose. The South Africans innings came off just 44 balls and was studded with 12 boundaries and a six. He was dismissed in the 15th over, trying to loft a Ramesh Powar delivery over long-on, only to be caught by Piyush Chawla.         
	Ojha, who was dismissed for a duck in his first match, hit Powar for two massive sixes and a four in the very first over. Ojha struck five boundaries and an equal number of sixes during his knock.         
	The Kings XI captain Yuvraj tried seven bowlers in a bid to stop the run flow but none could do the trick for him. Yusuf Abdulla conceded 44 runs without picking up a wicket in the three overs he bowled. Sreesanth, playing his first IPL game after recovering from a back injury, was not as expensive to start with but was taken to task in his fourth and final over, which left him with figures of none for 44. Powars only wicket of Smith proved way too costly as he ended up giving away 33 runs in his three overs.

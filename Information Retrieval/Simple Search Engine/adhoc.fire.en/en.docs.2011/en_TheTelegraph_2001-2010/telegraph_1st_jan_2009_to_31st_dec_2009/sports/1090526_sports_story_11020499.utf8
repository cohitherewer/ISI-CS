                                                   Club crisis for Bobs boys
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: With less than a week to go for the opening of the inter-state transfer window, a host of top footballers are yet to receive any viable offer from leading I-League clubs in the country.         
	Interestingly, quite a few of them are national team stars, who have been called up by Bob Houghton for the Nehru Cup camp beginning next month.         
	The biggest name in the list is that of goalkeeper Subrata Paul, whose stunning deeds in the AFC Challenge Cup in 2008 helped India qualify for the Asian Cup final round after 24 years.         
	Paul, who has been shown the door by East Bengal after his not-too-impressive performance in the I-League, is yet to find a club.         
	After Goa s Dempo Sports Club refused to accommodate him, Paul is believed to be trying his luck with the two newly promoted teams  Salgaocar and Pune FC.         
	While another East Bengal reject, Surkumar Singh is yet to receive any concrete offer from either of the two clubs he approached  Mahindra United and Salgaocar club  two other national campers, Sushil Singh and Abhishek Yadav have only received offers from an institutional team in the second division.

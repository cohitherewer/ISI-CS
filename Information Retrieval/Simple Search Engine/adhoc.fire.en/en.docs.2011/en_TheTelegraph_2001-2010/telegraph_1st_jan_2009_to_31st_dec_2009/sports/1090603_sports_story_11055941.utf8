	Chennai: Rusty Bengal were lucky to escape with a 1-1 draw against a 10-man Tamil Nadu, while Manipur beat holders Punjab 2-1 in Group A quarter final league matches of the 63rd National Football Championship for the Santosh Trophy, here on Tuesday.         
	Bengal needed a goal deep into stoppage time to grab a point after PC Riju gave the hosts the lead in the 40th minute.         
	Bengal goalkeeper Subhasish Roy Chowdhury bungled while collecting a long throw-in from Pradeep Kumar and Riju, who was lurking nearby, hit the back of the net.         
	Bengal equaliser came in 93rd minute. Tamil Nadu goalkeeper Satish Kumar deflected Habibur Rehman Mondals volley from a Snehasish Chakrabortys corner on to the path of PC Lalawmpuiya, who headed it home to earn Bengal a point. The hosts were a man short when the impressive N Mohanraj was red carded in the 20th minute after picking up two yellow cards. The India international was a livewire on the left putting the Bengal defence in trouble.         
	His ejection hardly affected Tamil Nadus rhythm. Playing in front of the home crowd, they used the flanks and found plenty of space down the middle.         
	Bengal got some chances but erratic display from Tarif Ahmed and Gautam Thakur upfront nearly cost them the match.         
	Earlier, an own goal from Sarabjit Singh and one from Subhas Singh helped Manipur beat defending champions Punjab.         
	Punjab took the lead in the 27th minute when an unmarked Balwant Singh headed in a Boy Singh cross from the left.         
	But Manipur equalised within two minutes when a free-kick from M Raju was deflected into his own goal by Sarabjit.         
	Manipur grew from strength to strength and after the change of ends applied more pressure on the Punjab defence. They were rewarded in the 48th minute when Subhas found the net from close range.         
	R Vashum left Anwar Ali and Ravinder Singh chasing shadows and took a shot on goal. Karanjit Singh blocked the effort partially but Subhas was close to knock in the rebound.

                                                   Yuvraj: Take one match at a time
                      
	Kimberley: The race to the Indian Premier League semi-finals seems headed for a thrilling climax and in a bid to avoid getting bogged down by pressure the Kings XI Punjab skipper Yuvraj Singh has urged his side to focus on only one match at a time.         
	Yuvraj wants his men to take it easy and not think too much about the semi-final berth.         
	Thinking about the semi-final means taking a lot of pressure, Instead it is important that we look at each day differently and contribute in every game. If we keep playing well, we will definitely make it to the semi-finals. But we need to look only as far as the next match, Yuvraj told reporters here.

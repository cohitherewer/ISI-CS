                                                   Dempo eye berth in next round
                      
	New Delhi: Dempo SC would be looking to brush aside their 0-1 defeat to Muharraq in the last match when they take on Syrian side Al Maged in their AFC Cup encounter at the Al Abbasiyyin Stadium in Damascus on Tuesday.         
	After four matches in Group E, Dempo and Al Maged share the lead with seven points but the Syrian club are on top on account of more goals scored.         
	A win for Dempo in this top of the table clash will definitely put them through to the next round. They will go into the match with an edge, having beaten Al Maged 1-0 in the first leg. We have defeated Al Majed at home and are confident that we can get a positive result, Dempo coach Armando Colaco said.         
	The Syrian sides aware of Dempos might and Al Maged coach Ibrahim Mahlami acknowledged as much when he said: Dempo are a good side and their win against Al Faisaly in Amman sends us the message that they are a strong team and we must respect them.

                                                   Bencharifa satisfied with show
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa was not worried about his teams tale of missed chances in the Calcutta Football League opener against Kalighat. In fact, he was satisfied with the performance of his team at the club ground on Wednesday.         
	Im happy with the performance and pleased with the energy level they showed in the match, Bencharifa said. They ran for every ball and never gave up.         
	The Moroccan tried to look at the positives from the numerous misses.         
	Chidi hit the post four times. Im looking at it positively. He was at the right place at the right time.         
	Thats very important for a striker. Though he missed, he created that many chances too.         
	He has to be given credit for that, Bencharifa was backing his erring striker to the hilt.         
	On a lighter vein he said: I had a chat with him and he told me he was saving the goals for Sundays I-League derby!         
	About Sundays match against archrivals East Bengal, Bencharifa played it safe.         
	It will be a game of character, experience and nerves. If the match is well controlled and well officiated, Im confident, he said.         
	Bencharifa had a reason to smile on Wednesday. His talisman Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto reiterated that he would be fit for the Super Sunday.         
	Ill start training with the squad on Friday and I think two days practice will be enough for the Sunday match, Barreto said after watching his team win.         
	The Brazilian had injured quadriceps muscle in his left leg and was a doubtful starter for the East Bengal match.

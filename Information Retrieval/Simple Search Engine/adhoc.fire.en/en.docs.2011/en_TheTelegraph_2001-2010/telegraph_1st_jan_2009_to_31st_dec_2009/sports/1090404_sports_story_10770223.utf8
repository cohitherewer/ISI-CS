The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Englands Cup squad taking shape 
                                                     Englands Cup squad taking shape 
            [+uc('Henry Winter   THE DAILY TELEGRAPH')+]            David Beckham                           
	Metatarsals permitting, Englands squad for South Africa is taking shape and David Beckhams extraordinary Indian summer looks set to turn into an Indian Ocean summer. It is only half-time in qualifying for 2010, five hurdles remain to be cleared, and Fabio Capello very sensibly urges caution. The future! The future! The future! Please! he kept saying after the 2-1 win over Ukraine. But England supporters were Thursday looking at travel itineraries and ticket arrangements, while players were jostling for positions in the World Cup 23.         
	Plan A is now known in shape and personnel. Lining up in 4-2-3-1 formation, it reads: David James; Glen Johnson, Rio Ferdinand, John Terry, Ashley Cole; Frank Lampard, Gareth Barry; Theo Walcott, Wayne Rooney, Steven Gerrard; Emile Heskey.         
	That leaves room for two reserve keepers and 10 outfield players. Predictions are complicated by one of the many positive elements Capello has instilled in the team: fluidity. Gerrard now starts on the left but can play anywhere across midfield, even second striker. Lampard is now more of a holding midfielder but everyone knows his box-to-box capabilities. Walcott is a right-winger whom Capello, and Arsene Wenger, also see long-term as a central threat. Versatility rules.         
	Starting in goal, James and Ben Foster are guaranteed places while Robert Green needs to see off the threat of Joe Hart. If Capello seeks to free up a position in the 23 (so accommodating an extra striker) he could use Phil Jagielka as cover for Johnson as right-back, although Wes Brown is expected to travel. Left-back is straightforward: Ashley Cole and Wayne Bridge (the Manchester City defender sure to be on board unless Capello turns to the flexible Joleon Lescott).         
	England are strong at centre-half with Ferdinand and Terry, whose late winner rescued the team against a dogged Ukrainian side. He is one of the players with a big personality, said Capello.         
	He is very English. But, like Rio, for a centre-back he is very good technically as well. He is strong with the head and in the tackle. But he is also very good with the ball at his feet.         
	As for his reserve centre-halves, Capello will doubtless rely on Matthew Upson while a potentially fraught phone call to the Spurs manager, Harry Redknapp, may be required in May, 2010.         
	Englands possible 2010 World Cup 23: James, Foster, Green; Johnson, Brown, Ferdinand, Terry, King, Upson, A Cole, Bridge; Walcott, Beckham, Lampard, Barry, Carrick, Hargreaves, Gerrard, J Cole; Rooney, Heskey, Agbonlahor, Defoe.

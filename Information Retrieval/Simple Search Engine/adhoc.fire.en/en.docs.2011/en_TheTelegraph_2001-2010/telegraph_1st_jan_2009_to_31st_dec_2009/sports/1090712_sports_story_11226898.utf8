    - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 
  -  Icon admits hes a huge admirer of Dhoni             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Icon Sunil Manohar Gavaskar spoke at length to The Telegraph in the lead-up to his 60th birthday. The interviews first instalment (based on the one-on-one in London) was published in these columns on Friday.               
	Here goes the concluding part               
	Q To talk of captaincy first, what are the qualities that a captain should have?         
	A My answer is simple: Anybody who himself does the things he wants his teammates to do will make a good captain.         
	Which school of captaincy did you belong to?         
	Theres no such thing as a school of captaincy, its just a media-made myth.         
	Were you an autocrat in the dressing room or, to borrow a phrase from Ian Chappell, would you captain by committee?         
	Its good to ask the others sometimes, like what the tactics should be, and after hearing them, to make your call...         
	Do todays captains find themselves under more pressure?         
	Pressure is always there, since everybody else thinks that he or she can do a better job... With the expansion of the media, the pressure is greater not only on the captain, but on everybody else as well.         
	Captains versus coaches... Who is the boss?         
	The captain is always the boss and the coach is there to guide him... Being away from the action, he sees things that may not be seen by the captain because of the pressure on the field.         
	Why do problems crop up between captains and coaches, like between Sourav Ganguly and Greg Chappell or, more recently, between Kevin Pietersen and Peter Moores?         
	I wouldnt know the answer as I wasnt in the dressing room...         
	Did you learn from anybodys captaincy?         
	Yes, you learn from all those whove captained you You try and imbibe their good points and, equally, try to avoid their bad ones.         
	Who has been Indias finest captain  Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi or Sourav?         
	At the end of the day, results count and the one who delivers is the captain you want.         
	[With 21 wins in 49 Tests, Sourav ended with a success percentage of 42.86. Pataudi had 9 wins in 40 with a success rate of 22.50. Gavaskar, incidentally, won 9 of his 47 Tests to record a success percentage of 19.15. Pataudi didnt captain in ODIs, while Sourav (52.05 success rate) and Gavaskar (37.84 success percentage) did.]         
	Why did Sachin Tendulkar fail as captain?         
	Sachin is full of ideas, but its not always easy to implement them, for all 11 players are not of the same mindset.         
	You come across as a Mahendra Singh Dhoni fan...         
	Absolutely.         
	What would you tell a room full of rookie captains?         
	Look after your boys, for they will be the ones to look after you.         
	Given a chance, would you do anything different as captain?         
	(Amused) Yes, hit the ball in the air! Then, nobody would refer to me as a defensive captain... Seriously, though, I would have liked to have kept my cool after the verbal abuse I got as I was making my way back to the pavilion at the MCG (1980-81 Test series)... It was the abuse and not the wrong decision which flipped me over the top and made me ask Chetan (Chauhan) to walk off with me... Being the captain, I should have kept my cool, despite the abusive provocation, and maybe thats why Im such a huge admirer of Dhoni who never seems to get ruffled by anything.         
	The all-time best captain anywhere...         
	Ray Illingworth. He made us feel we were chasing 1700 when we were actually chasing 173 at the Oval in the summer of 1971!         
	Moving to batting, what do you look for in an opener?         
	An opener needs plenty of determination and lots of luck... I would look for a batsman who is willing to hang in there when the ball is doing things and, then, make the bowlers pay once the conditions ease out... Of course, Im talking of Test cricket and not limited overs action.         
	Can openers be made, so to say, or do they have to be naturals?         
	Ideally, an opener should be one who has batted in that position from the junior level, for that prepares him mentally to face the new ball on a pitch which he is yet to ascertain.         
	Your take on makeshift arrangements at the very top of the order...         
	If a batsman has the determination, then he can bat anywhere, so theres no hard and fast rule about turning middle-order batsmen into openers. Only those who have the determination will succeed.         
	Did you admire an opener in your early years?         
	Conrad Hunte... He had such a wonderful balance at the crease.         
	What about the present times?         
	I love watching our openers, (Virender) Sehwag and (Gautam) Gambhir, who show plenty of determination and have the range of shots to toy with all bowlers.         
	One wonders what made you choose such a demanding position Why indeed?         
	I didnt choose... Since I was so tiny, I got bullied into batting there by seniors in school and, so, there I was facing the new ball not knowing which way it was going to swing!         
	Finally, your message for those aspiring to be a Gavaskar...         
	Give the bowlers the first hour, then the rest of the day will be yours... This advice is, of course, limited to Test cricket.         
	 Concluded

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Multiple-leader concept trial very much on in SA
                                                     Multiple-leader concept trial very much on in SA
    - KKR cricket manager doesnt react to attack by Sunil Gavaskar           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            John Buchanan, Shah Rukh Khan and Sourav Ganguly at the launch of the team jersey before the first edition of the Indian Premier League, in 2008                                 
	Calcutta: John Buchanan took a no comments line on the rather personal attack by Sunil Gavaskar, but confirmed that some things would definitely be tried out during the Kolkata Knight Riders practice matches in South Africa.         
	All that on the morning after principal owner Shah Rukh Khan called for breathing space to experiment and strongly defended the head of his IPL franchises cricket operations.         
	Many of the Knights are already in South Africa, camping in Bloemfontein, ahead of the IPLs second edition, from April 18.         
	I dont wish to drag this captaincy business any further There will certainly be a designated captain in a match, but the batting-order, for example, would be set by the coach (Matthew Mott) and there will be leaders on the park As Ive been saying, T20 has to be approached differently and some things have to be tried out, Buchanan told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Monday, a day before the first two warm-up matches (against Free State), he added: We need a clear picture of what happens Is there, for example, a difference between the game plan and whats being delivered? So, somebody could exclusively look after the bowling and somebody else the fielding Theyll be complementing the captain         
	Buchanan pointed out that the next 10 days or so would be utilised to ensure the concept works.         
	Cant exactly be music to Sourav Gangulys ears, though.         
	Sourav and three others  Mashrafe Mortaza, Arindam Ghosh and Anureet Singh  reached Bloemfontein on Monday evening.         
	Weve got to be absolutely sure that (a) theres no mis-communication and (b) the game doesnt slow down Weve got to see how the concept works and, indeed, whats best for us There would be a review at the end of our conditioning camp and the practice matches.         
	The Knight Riders leave Bloemfontein for Cape Town (venue of their opener, on April 19) on April 15.         
	When the Gavaskar issue was broached, Buchanan said: The hotels net is down and the wi-fi hasnt been working So, while Ive been told about Gavaskars column, I havent actually read it Even if I had, I wouldnt have reacted So, no comments.         
	As for the solid backing from Shah Rukh, during a promotional in Mumbai, he said: Ive got a wonderful relationship with him, as also (co-owners) Jay and Juhi Mehta Ive been enjoying working with them         
	Its a two-way traffic as, clearly, Shah Rukh and the co-owners enjoy working with Buchanan.         
	THE KKR XI FOR TUESDAY         
	Aakash Chopra, Morne van Wyk, Cheteshwar Pujara, Sunny Singh, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Shoaib Sheikh, Ajit Agarkar, Murali Kartik, Ashok Dinda, Sourav Sarkar, Charl Langeveldt

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rival faction demands fair elections
                            Rival faction demands fair elections
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The rival faction in Indian hockey, headed by Bengal Hockey Association president J.B. Roy and Indian Womens Hockey Federation secretary Amrit Bose Monday demanded fair elections in a democratic manner to a new unified body for the mens and womens game in the country.         
	We have only one demand, and that is fair elections conducted in a democratic manner, Roy told the media.         
	In a show of strength, the group paraded the officials of the state associations, both mens and womens, and distributed attendance sheets of the two-day meeting at Amby Valley. In all, 22 mens state units and 20 womens units had attended the meeting hosted by Roy over the weekend.         
	The group, however, stopped short of calling itself the parallel administrative body.         
	We are not a different body. We dont want to create new problems for Indian hockey, Bose said.         
	This is the first time that the mens and womens state associations have been merged. Its a historic day for Indian hockey, she added.         
	Bose said that the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Suresh Kalmadi had invited her and Roy to discuss various issues. And the group has authorised Roy and myself to hold talks with the IOA, she said.         
	Roy minced no words in questioning the credibility of Hockey India, an umbrella body put in place by the IOA to run the mens and womens game, in accordance with the guidelines of the International Hockey Federation (FIH).         
	There is no one from hockey in Hockey India. A.K. Mattoo (former president of the Boxing Federation of India), Aslam Khan (vice-president of IOA) and Harish Sharma (secretary of the Basketball Federation of India) have been appointed (president, secretary general and executive member respectively) while those who have served hockey for years have not even been consulted, Roy said.         
	But before they challenge the IOA, Roy and Bose would have to be wary of the faction-within-faction factor.         
	For instance, representatives of the state units of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu attended both the meetings, in Amby Valley and in Delhi where K.P.S. Gill offered conditional support to the IOA and Hockey India on Sunday.

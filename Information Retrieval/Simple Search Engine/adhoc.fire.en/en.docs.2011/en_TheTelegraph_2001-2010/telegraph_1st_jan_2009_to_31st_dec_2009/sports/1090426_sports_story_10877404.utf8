The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussie move condemned
                                                   Aussie move condemned
            OUR BUREAU                            
	The Indian tennis fraternity along with sports minister M.S. Gill Saturday expressed deep disappointment over Australias decision to pull out of the May 8-10 Davis Cup tie in Chennai.               
	The following are excerpts (alphabetically)         
	AKHTAR ALI: I cannot imagine this kind of a decision by the Australian tennis authorities. This is not only unfortunate but very disappointing too.         
	M.S. GILL: The United Kingdom has had terrorist incidents, but Australia will be going there for the Ashes series and play before crowds of 30,000 or more with obvious security concerns. Am I to understand they wont go to England!         
	RAMANATHAN KRISHNAN: It is unfortunate that Australia have pulled out of the tie. We have played Australia a number of times in Chennai and it could have been yet another good event.         
	RAMESH KRISHNAN: India and Australia have a long tradition (of Davis Cup tennis). Nothing of this kind has happened before.         
	JAIDIP MUKERJEA: Its a very unfortunate decision taken by Tennis Australia. I dont think this is the right decision. Their concern over security is not at all right. After the Mumbai blasts various ATP tournaments were held in India, so many foreign players came and played here They did not find any problem. This is a regretful decision and we missed good competition.

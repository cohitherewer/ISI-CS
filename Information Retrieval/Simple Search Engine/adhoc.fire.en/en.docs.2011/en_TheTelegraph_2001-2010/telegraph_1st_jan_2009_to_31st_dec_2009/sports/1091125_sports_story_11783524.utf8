	Karachi: The Indian Premier League (IPL) has allowed an extension to Pakistani players to submit their NOCs for the lucrative league, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ijaz Butt said Tuesday.         
	Butt said, initially the IPL had kept November 20 as the deadline for all players from all countries to submit their NOCs from boards and governments. But I spoke to the IPL commissioner Lalit Modi, and asked him to extend the deadline for our players, since our situation was different from other countries, Butt said.         
	Modi very graciously allowed the deadline to be extended to November 30. We have now sent all required documents to the government, seeking the clearance for our players to take part in the IPL, he told reporters.

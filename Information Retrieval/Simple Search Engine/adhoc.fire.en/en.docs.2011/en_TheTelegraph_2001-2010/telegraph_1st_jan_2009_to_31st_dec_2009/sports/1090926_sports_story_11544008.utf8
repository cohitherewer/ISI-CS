                                                   CWG, London 2012 on Rameshs mind
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Wrestler Ramesh Kumar, who won a bronze in the World Championships, said that his performance in the meet remained below his expectations as his aim was to win a gold medal.         
	I wont say I was disappointed because at least I could win a bronze medal, said the 74kg freestyle grappler after he arrived in the capital on Friday.         
	But my preparation was good enough to finish on top, he said.         
	Rameshs target was to make it three-in-a-row in the World Championships. I bagged a gold in the 1997 Sub-Junior World meet and repeated my performance in the Junior World Championships in 2001. So, here too I was eager to win a gold.         
	The Haryana wrestlers next aim is to win a medal in the London Olympics. I want to start preparing for the Olympics immediately. I couldnt participate in the Beijing Olympics because of an injury. Next time, I dont want to miss it.         
	The first Indian to win a World Championships medal in 42 years, Ramesh was sad that wrestling never received the required publicity in the media. The game doesnt even have good financial backing, he said. Look at Sushil Kumar. He won an Olympic medal but still no major sponsor has come forward to help the sport. Apart from our federation, Indian Railways are the only body, who are backing wrestling, said Ramesh.         
	India has the potential to become a great wrestling nation, he said. But then, more facilities should be provided to the wrestlers. Thats the key to success, Ramesh added.         
	The wrestler is confident that India would do well in the Commonwealth Games. Our preparations are going on very well. In 2005, I won a gold medal in the Commonwealth wrestling meet. Now I want to win a medal in front of my countrymen. Ramesh said.         
	Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit congratulated him on his winning the bronze and offered help from the state government.         
	An employee of Indian Railways, Ramesh also said that railway minister Mamata Banerjee had promised to help wrestling in every possible way.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Laxman is back in top 20 
                                                     Laxman is back in top 20 
            A STAFF REPORTER            VVS Laxman in action in Napier                           
	Calcutta: V.V.S. Laxman has returned to the top-20 of the Reliance Mobile ICC player rankings for Test batsmen after his fighting unconquered century helped India salvage a draw in the Napier Test.         
	The stylish right-hander followed up his 76 in Indias 305 all out in the first innings with an unbeaten 124 as the visitors finished on 476 for four after being forced to follow on.         
	Laxman jumped six places to put himself in 15th position, just behind Sachin Tendulkar, who contributed 49 and 64 in the match, the ICC said in a release.         
	In the rankings for Test bowlers, Ishant Sharmas three for 95 in the drawn match helped him leapfrog Jacques Kallis of South Africa, Pakistans Danish Kaneria and Englands Monty Panesar to a career-best 17th spot.         
	Opener Gautam Gambhir was the highest-ranked India batsman in fifth place and his knock of 137 in the second innings has not only strengthened his current position but has put him within striking distance of fourth-placed Mahela Jayawardene of Sri Lanka.         
	While Laxman is the only player in the top-20 to make an upward movement, Indias stand-in captain Virender Sehwag is the only batsman in the top-20 who has slipped down the ladder. The opener has dropped two places to 17th position after scores of 34 and 22.         
	The table is still headed by Shivnarine Chanderpaul of the West Indies who leads Pakistan captain Younis Khan by a very small margin while Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara is in third position.         
	Sri Lankas iconic spinner Muttiah Muralidharan is the still the No. 1 ranked bowler with South Africas Dale Steyn in second spot and Mitchell Johnson of Australia in third place.         
	In the ICC Test Championship table, India will retain their third position behind Australia and South Africa irrespective of how the Wellington Test pans out.         
	If India wins the match and the series 2-0, it will stay on 118 ratings points while New Zealand will also stay on 81 ratings points.         
	However, if New Zealand turn the tables on India and win the Test to square the series, India will slip to 115 ratings points while New Zealand will rise to 85 ratings points.

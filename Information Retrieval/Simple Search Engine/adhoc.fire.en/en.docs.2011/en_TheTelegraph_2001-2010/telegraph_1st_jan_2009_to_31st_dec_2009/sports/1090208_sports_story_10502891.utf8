The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team India have an eye on the No.1 position
                                                     Team India have an eye on the No.1 position
    - Only pride at stake for Sri Lanka

Premadasa Stadium on Saturday,   the eve of Indias fifth and final ODI against Sri Lanka. (AFP)                                  
	Calcutta/Colombo: Winning is a habit. It breeds confidence and Mahendra Singh Dhonis men have been on a high in the current one-day series.         
	Having achieved their best ever ODI ranking by displacing world champions Australia as the No.2 team, India will be hoping to inflict the first-ever series whitewash when they take on Sri Lanka in the fifth and final match on Sunday.         
	Coach Gary Kirsten is already eyeing the No.1 spot. Getting to No.1 is the obvious goal this year, but you just cant think you have won the series 4-0 and be complacent in the next game. It doesnt happen with us. When you go on to the field, you go to win and not just compete. Great teams are those that carry the momentum forward into every game, Kirsten said.         
	Every win from here on will bring Team India one step closer to the No.1 spot, currently occupied by South Africa (125) with a lead of just three points.         
	India are on their longest winning streak in one-day Internationals (nine so far) but, as Kirsten stressed, are guarded against complacency. One motivation for them is that if Australia beat New Zealand on Sunday, and India lose, they will slip back to No. 3 in the rankings.         
	Winning the toss could once again turn out to be a big factor in the circumstances  the spinners have had plenty of assistance when they bowl second at the Premadasa. Muttiah Muralidharan and Ajantha Mendis, though, havent had the chance to bowl under lights.         
	The Indians have been phenomenal in the series. While Sachin Tendulkar, Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag provide aggression at the top of the order, the likes of Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Yusuf Pathan and Dhoni have been rock-steady at the middle.         
	Gambhir shrugged off an indifferent series with a career-best 150 in the last game. Gambhirs strategy of walking down the track before the delivery may have a bit of risk involved, but it clearly speaks of his self-assurance and confidence.         
	Sehwags early departure in the last match forced Gambhir to steady himself and set a platform, and together with Dhoni, he flourished. The key lies in getting a good start, so it would fall on Gambhir to bat responsibly.         
	India are likely to rest Yuvraj and Praveen Kumar and bring in Sachin and Laxmipathy Balaji. Sachin received three dubious decisions before being rested for the fourth ODI, and will be itching to get a good score before the tour of New Zealand.         
	During an optional net session at the Premadasa, Sachin batted for 45 minutes. The others present included Dhoni, Balaji, Irfan Pathan and Ravindra Jadeja.         
	Balaji was recalled in place of an injured Munaf Patel and, on the back of a good domestic season, will be keen to add to his 29 ODI appearances, the last of which came in 2005 in Sri Lanka. Young allrounder Jadeja may also earn his maiden India cap. Pragyan Ojha may have to sit out then.         
	Faced with the prospect of an embarrassing 0-5 whitewash, a demoralised Sri Lanka will look to salvage some pride before the home crowd.         
	The Lankans have floundered in every department of the game. If their batting and bowling have been below par, their fielding has been dreadful. Without veteran Chaminda Vaas, the Lankan pace attack looked clueless. The biggest disappointment, however, has been the performance of the spin duo of Muralidharan and Mendis.

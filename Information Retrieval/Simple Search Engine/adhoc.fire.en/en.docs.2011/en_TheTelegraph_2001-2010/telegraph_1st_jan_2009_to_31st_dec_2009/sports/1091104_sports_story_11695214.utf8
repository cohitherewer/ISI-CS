	Jerome Taylor returns to lead the pace attack, and will be aided by Ravi Rampaul, Roach and Tonge. Shivnarine Chanerpaul, Ramnaresh Sarwan and all-rounder Dwayne Bravo are also back.         
	Cricket Australia, on Tuesday, expressed relief, learning a full-strength West Indies squad would be touring the country.

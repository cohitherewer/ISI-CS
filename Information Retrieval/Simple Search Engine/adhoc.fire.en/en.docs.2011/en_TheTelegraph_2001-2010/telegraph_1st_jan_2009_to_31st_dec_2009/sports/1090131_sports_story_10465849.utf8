                                                   Md. Sp. look for safety at home
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: A desperate Mohammedan Sporting will look to bag full points when they take on I-League leaders Sporting Clube de Goa in their 13th round match at home on Saturday.         
	Mohammedan Sporting, who are currently placed 11th in the 12-team I-League, have a tough battle ahead and would have to play out of their skins to stave-off relegation.         
	The black-and-white brigade will aim for full points from their home encounters, coach Shabbir Ali said after the teams practice session on Friday.         
	Tomorrows match is very important for us. Its our home match and it will be very difficult for us if we cant do it at home, Shabbir said.         
	We have away matches against teams like Dempo and Churchill. Those matches in Goa are going to be very difficult, so we have to target our home matches.         
	The fact that Sporting Clube lost to bottom-placed Vasco in their last match, would also give some hope to Mohammedan Sporting, who have 10 points from their 12 matches.         
	Goas Sporting Clube are still on top with 25 points but Mohun Bagan and Churchill Brothers are snapping at their heels.         
	The Goan club had a dismal Federation Cup and failed to make it to the last four.         
	Coach Viswas Gaonkar said the team were looking to take the positives from their 0-1 loss against Vasco.         
	Our performance in the last match was unfortunate Theres just no explanation. We failed to play proper football, Gaonkar said after the teams practice at the East Bengal ground.         
	But were taking the loss positively It was a learning experience for us. Were only playing for a win tomorrow. There is no other option.         
	Mohammedan Sporting will miss the services of Madhab Das and Shovan Chakraborty due to card problems. Anit Ghosh is also out with injury. Goutam Thakur and Sheikh Azim will make a comeback.         
	The Calcutta club will field all their three foreigners  Mike Okoro, Adewusi Adebayo and Eugene Gray  in Saturdays match. However, Okoro will be the man they will be looking at to score. The Ghanaian skipped practice on Friday due to giddiness.         
	The Goan outfit have travelled to Calcutta with only two foreigners in Brazilian Luciano Sabrosa and Nigerian Elijah Obagbemiro Junior. The third foreigner Nathaniel Amos is out with injury.

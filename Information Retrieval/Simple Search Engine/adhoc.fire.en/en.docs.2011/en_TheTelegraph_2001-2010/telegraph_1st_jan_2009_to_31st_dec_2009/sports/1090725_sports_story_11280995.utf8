The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sangakkara ensures draw
                                                   Sangakkara ensures draw
    - Captain stays unbeaten on superb 130 
  -Sri Lanka win series 2-0                                   
	Colombo: Sri Lanka pulled out of their world record fourth innings run chase, instead settling for a draw against Pakistan in the third Test ending Friday and a 2-0 series win.         
	Captain Kumar Sangakkara scored a patient century to put his team within striking distance of the ambitious 492-run target, needing 154 runs in the final session.         
	But as the required run rate climbed, he and Anjelo Mathews elected not to pursue the target and risk defeat, so the captains agreed to call off the match with Sri Lanka on 391 for four with 15 overs remaining.         
	A draw was a creditable result for Sri Lanka given Pakistan started the day positioned to push for victory, with the hosts on 183 for three. However the tourists took just one wicket on day five, coming up against a stubborn Sangakkara, who finished unbeaten on 130, his 19th Test hundred.         
	We werent really thinking too much about going for totals, Sangakkara said. If you bat trying to save a game, you really cant go negative. That plays into the oppositions hands.         
	We tried to keep a positive outlook but we tried to play proper Test cricket, bat long and build partnerships.         
	He said an injury to batsman Tillekeratne Dilshan influenced the decision to agree draw stumps early.         
	Dilshan has a fractured finger and a cut above the eyebrow.         
	Sangakkara, the usually flamboyant left-hander was more sedate, spending more than seven hours at the crease, facing 303 balls and hitting just seven fours.         
	Sangakkara lost his overnight partner Thilan Samaraweera in the middle session after a 122-run stand for the fourth wicket. But he then combined with Mathews to resist the tourists and ensure the tail was not exposed.         
	Mathews, playing his third Test, brought up his maiden half-century and was 64 not out at close. He faced 148 balls and hit seven fours and a six.         
	Samaraweera appeared in discomfort after suffering a cramp and was soon out, edging a doosra from Saeed Ajmal to wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal. His 73 runs came off 143 balls and included 11 fours.         
	The West Indies will retain the record for the highest fourth innings run chase with 418 for seven against Australia six years ago.         
	Sri Lanka got a good start to the run chase on Thursday as openers Tharanga Paranavitana and Malinda Warnapura put on 83 for the first wicket before legspinner Danish Kaneria took two wickets to jolt the chase.         
	Warnapura (31), Paranavitana (73) and Mahela Jayawardene (2) were dismissed before the close on the fourth day.         
	Kaneria was the best of the Pakistan bowlers in the second innings, with two for 114.         
	Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam said his team had squandered their early momentum in the series.         
	Nothing succeeds like success. If we had won that first Test match... we never thought we will lose needing 97 runs, Alam said. We had a good chance of winning this series if you analyse the three Test matches.         
	Pakistan batted first after losing the toss and made 299 in their first innings. Sri Lanka were bowled out for 233 runs in their first innings conceding a 66-run lead. Pakistan declared their second innings on 425 for nine on Thursday.         
	It was Sri Lankas first series victory at home against Pakistan in six attempts.           (AP)

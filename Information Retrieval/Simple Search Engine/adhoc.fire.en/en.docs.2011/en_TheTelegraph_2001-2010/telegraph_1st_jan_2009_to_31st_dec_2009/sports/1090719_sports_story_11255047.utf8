The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger falls in a spate of errors
                                                     Tiger falls in a spate of errors
            CHRISTOPHER CLAREY            Woods                           
	Turnberry (Scotland): It felt like a familiar scene as Tiger Woods played the closing holes of a British Open course in the late-afternoon light with the suspense building.         
	Outside the ropes, spectators were jostling for position. Inside the ropes, photographers were scrambling for the best sight lines. As Woodss approach shots soared into the air, there were standard shouts of In the hole! and, this being Scotland, Well done, Tie-gah!         
	But the circumstances were, in fact, most unfamiliar. This was a Friday afternoon, not a Sunday afternoon, and what was dangling in the balance for Woods was not the Claret Jug, which goes to the champion, but simply making the cut.         
	Despite birdies on 16 and 17, the worlds leading golfer would fall short by one shot, which was just about as surprising as the strange-but-true development that the 59-year-old Tom Watson shared the lead after two rounds. Obviously, its disappointing, theres no doubt, said Woods, who shot a four-over-par 74.         
	Through seven holes, all was well with Woods, who was at one-under par for the round and even for the tournament. The weather had already turned, with a downpour forcing Woods and his caddie, Steve Williams, to share an umbrella on the sixth hole.         
	But as Woods and his playing partners, Lee Westwood and Ryo Ishikawa, moved on to the lovely coastal stretch of the Ailsa Course, his struggles began. He bogeyed 8 and 9 and then, on the revamped 10th, mishit another 3-wood off the tee that faded to the right and landed in the rough.         
	Aware that he might not find his ball, Woods hit a provisional drive, and despite the help of marshals and scores of spectators, Woods never did locate his first ball. He took a penalty stroke and ended up with a double-bogey 6. He later made a bogey on the 12th and another double bogey on the 13th before finally recovering his balance.         
	But after dropping an astonishing seven shots in six holes, he did not recover his opportunity to play on the weekend in his first trip to Turnberry.         
	Missed cuts for Woods are as rare as first-round losses for his friend Roger Federer. Since turning professional in 1996, Woods has missed just one cut in a Major tournament, the 2006 US Open at Winged Foot, which came when he was still reeling from the death of his father six weeks before.         
	But this time there was no obvious trigger. Though he missed eight months after major knee surgery, he arrived at Turnberry having won two of his last three tournaments and having finished in a tie for sixth in the US Open. True, he had never played this course before this visit, but the same was true at Royal Liverpool, where he won his third British Open title in 2006.

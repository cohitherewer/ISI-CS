                                                   Rumours of Roman rift
            HENRY WINTER                      
	Is Roman Abramovich looking to sell Chelsea? The club insist their Russian benefactor remains fully committed to his west London adventure but the possibility of Abramovich moving on was debated at length in certain parts of the City of London on Monday.         
	Abramovich does his business quietly, and no one had a whisper of his deal to buy out Ken Bates in June 2003 until the last moment, but those bankers discussing the Russians plans were asking one question in particular  Why now? If Abramovich is seeking to recoup a substantial part of his 600million investment, then this period of global financial meltdown seems a strange time to hang the for sale sign up outside the Bridge.         
	Chelsea are obviously a far more attractive proposition than Newcastle United, for their playing staff as much as anything, but the chill wind blowing through the financial markets has frozen much of the movement in the Klondike-style rush to buy a Premier League club.         
	Those who believe Abramovich is keen on offloading Chelsea argue that the oligarch may have taken a buffeting by the turbulence afflicting the financial markets. Unlikely. The wolf is hardly howling at the gates of this multi-billionaires mansion.         
	So why do these stories continue to grow about Abramovichs intentions? Some people are convinced the Russian might simply have fallen out of love with Chelsea, that the heartbreak of the Champions League final defeat in Moscow was just too much. Abramovich traditionally eschews public pronouncements but the increasing chatter about his intentions needs addressing.

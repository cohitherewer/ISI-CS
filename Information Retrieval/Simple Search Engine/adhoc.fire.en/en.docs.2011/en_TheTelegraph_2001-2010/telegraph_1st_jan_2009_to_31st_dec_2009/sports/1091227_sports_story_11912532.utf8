                                                                                                                       7                                                                                      Sans Pareil walks away with Oaks 
            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: The 5-4 favourite Sans Pareil was a bundle of stamina while the second favourite Harmonica failed miserably in the Ladies Derby, the 2,400m Poonawalla Calcutta Oaks, the main attraction in Saturdays eight-event card. Jockey Chris Hayes partnered the Suleiman Attaollahi-trained filly, by Burden of Proof out of Sans Eagle, to victory.          
	Sans Pareil was ridden well off the pace as Going For Gold and the 1,000 Guineas winner ,Bid For Gold, traded the lead with Castle Queen, too, warming up upfront for a brief while. The race was over for all practical purposes when the favourite decided to raise a gallop rounding the final turn.          
	The 1,400m Army Cup, in contrast, was a close affair between Ikaria and Ming. The former, from G. Vinayaks yard, managed to win by a long-neck.

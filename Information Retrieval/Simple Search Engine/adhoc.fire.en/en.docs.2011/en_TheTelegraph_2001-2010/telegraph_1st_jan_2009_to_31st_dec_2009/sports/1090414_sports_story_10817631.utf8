	Mumbai: Asserting that his team was a strong contender to win the Indian Premier League (IPL) in South Africa, Kings XI Punjab skipper Yuvraj Singh on Monday said he was banking upon his batting line-up and was looking to enhance his performance.         
	We have a good team. We have a good batting line-up with players like Shaun Marsh, Sangakkara and Jayawardene. One thing we miss is a good pacer like Sreesanth but we have enough bowling options, Yuvraj said during a promotional on Monday.         
	Admitting that his performance was not so good during the New Zealand tour, the stylish left hander said he was confident to do well in the coming matches.         
	I could have done better. I will try to make amends in the coming matches, Yuvraj said.         
	Refusing to comment on Kolkata Knight Riders multiple-captain theory, Yuvraj said: Every team has its own rule and I do not want to comment on this. (PTI)

                                                   BCCI forms panel to monitor suspect bowling action
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Saturday said that a three-member panel will monitor players with suspect bowling action in domestic cricket.         
	Jawagal Srinath, Srinivas Venkatraghavan and A.V. Jayaprakash will be on the panel to deal with suspect action following the recommendation of the umpires committee, Ratnakar Shetty, the boards chief administrative officer, said after the working committee meeting.         
	A list of bowlers has already been identified based on the reports given by match referees and the umpires. Having this panel will provide the players recourse to correct their action at an early stage of their careers, he said.         
	BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan issued a statement after the meeting in which he confirmed a reduction in its revenue to the tune of Rs 120 crore as a result of the cancellation of two ODIs against England and the tour of Pakistan besides the postponement of the ICC Champions Trophy in Pakistan.         
	However, the board noted that that despite the reduction in revenue, it will still have a healthy excess of income over expenditure for the current year.         
	The board also decided to have an inter-corporate tournament of its own with an aim to create employment opportunities for the players. The inter-corporate invitational meet will be held in 50 overs per side and Twenty20 formats. A six-member panel chaired by Sanjay Jagdale has been given the task of supervising the conduct of the tournament. The other members are K.S. Viswanathan, Shetty, Chamundeshwaranath, Ranjib Biswal and Anirudh Choudhary.         
	The winners will get Rs 1 crore while the runners-up and losing semi-finalists will be richer by Rs 50 lakh and Rs 25 lakh, respectively. The tournament is aimed at roping in public sector undertakings like Indian Oil, revenue teams like the Income Tax and the All-India Banks Board apart from some private corporate houses, who have been traditional supporters of the game.         
	The idea is to create an atmosphere for permanent employment for the players instead of temporary contracts, Shetty said.         
	The tournament will be held in July-September every year.         
	That is the period when tournaments like the Buchi Babu and Moin-ud-Dowlah are held, where the corporate teams play. But they have become association based and the board wanted to have a tournament of its own, Shetty said.         
	The following are the other key decisions taken at the meeting:         
	The reports of various sub-committees  umpires committee, finance committee, ground amp; pitches committee, junior cricket committee, senior tournaments committee, and the gradation committee  were approved.         
	It was decided that the board will encourage all associations to increase the number of grounds available for junior cricket, in particular the quality of wickets on which such matches will be played.         
	To hold specialised coaching camps for batsmen, fast bowlers and spinners at the state association academies of Mumbai, Punjab and Tamil Nadu, respectively. These camps will supplement the activities being carried out presently at the National Cricket Academy, Bangalore.

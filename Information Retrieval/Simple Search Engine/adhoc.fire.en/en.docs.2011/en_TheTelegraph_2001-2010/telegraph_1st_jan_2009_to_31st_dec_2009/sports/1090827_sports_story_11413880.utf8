The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Viru, Yuvi feel alls not well with junior cricket 
                                                     Viru, Yuvi feel alls not well with junior cricket 
                  Virender Sehwag                     
	Bangalore: A day after meeting the Delhi and Districts Cricket Association (DDCA) president Arun Jaitley, Virender Sehwag Wednesday said that there are discrepancies in the selection process at the lower level and hoped that his suggestions to the Delhi administrators would be implemented soon.         
	If you look at the Indian team, I dont think there is any need to give any suggestions because its the merit that matters. Whoever performs gets picked. There is never an instance where somebody has not performed and got picked, Sehwag said on the sidelines of a promotional.         
	It (unfair selections) happens at lower levels and I have given some suggestions to the DDCA I hope that my suggestions would be implemented soon and the results would be seen in near future, he added.         
	The India opener had spearheaded a revolt against the DDCA, accusing its sports committee of indulging in nepotism and corruption and his stand has been supported by senior players like Gautam Gambhir, Ishant Sharma and Ashish Nehra.         
	Team India vice-captain Yuvraj Singh also threw his weight behind Sehwag and supported his views on the selection process.         
	Sehwag has raised a voice and everybody is with him and we have the highest hope. There were instances where I performed but was not picked. Such unfair practices hurt the careers of young cricketers and shatter their dreams.         
	So I think the selection should be done keeping every players performance in contention, he said.         
	However, the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) termed Yuvrajs outbursts regarding discrimination in the selection at junior level as ill-founded and said the process was foolproof and hundred per cent done on merit.         
	I think what he has said is ill-founded. Yuvraj is a product of junior cricket and has all along been associated with the PCA. He has played so many matches at the junior level, BCCI treasurer and PCA secretary, MP Pandove said. Our selection system is totally foolproof. There is no discrimination at junior or senior level, he added.         
	Recovering from a right shoulder injury, Sehwag said he would start playing again from the first week of September.         
	Im feeling a little better. I had been hitting only 10-15 balls and havent tried cut and pull shots as it hurts, Sehwag said.         
	Meanwhile, on senior batsman Rahul Dravids return to the one-day squad after a gap of nearly two years, Yuvraj said it would lend experience to the side and also help younger players in the team.         
	Out of reckoning batsman Rohit Sharma said he was looking forward to the domestic season to improve his game. (PTI)

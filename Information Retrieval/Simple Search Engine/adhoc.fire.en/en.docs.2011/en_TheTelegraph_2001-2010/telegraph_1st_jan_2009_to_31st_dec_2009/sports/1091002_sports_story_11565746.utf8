The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Akram slams Dhoni
                                                   Akram slams Dhoni
                      
	Johannesburg: Disappointed with Indias early exit from the Champions Trophy, Wasim Akram has come down heavily on Mahendra Singh Dhoni for his listless captaincy.         
	Speaking at a press conference to mark his induction into the ICC Hall of Fame, the former Pakistan captain said: I think the body language of the Indians in this tournament wasnt good at all. I remember when Harbhajan came on to bowl and started conceding runs behind the wicket. If I was Dhoni I would have had a word with him and told him, I dont mind if you are hit through the covers but dont (bowl) this line, Akram said.         
	Despite the seven-wicket victory over the West Indies Wednesday, Indias campaign in the eight-nation tournament ended after Australia pipped Pakistan by two wickets in another Group A tie earlier in the day.         
	Akram cited the example of Imran Khan, recalling how the World Cup-winning former Pakistan captain used to mentor the pacers in times of difficulties. I have seen this happen to a lot of Indian fast bowlers. Initially all of them, Munaf (Patel), RP Singh, Irfan (Pathan) and Ishant (Sharma) appear to bowl 140kmph upwards but within a year their pace drops to 130s and 120s.         
	When this happens, I am reminded of what my skipper and mentor Imran Khan used to tell me. He used to ask me to just bowl fast without worrying too much about line and length, no balls and wides, Akram said. The legendary pacer, however, said one must be careful not to do an Irfan Pathan, who in his days of trouble, appeared to seek advice from too many people.         
	On Pakistans performance in the Champions Trophy, Akram feels Younis Khans men have a very good chance to enter the final.

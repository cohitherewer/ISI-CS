                                                     Commons fires new Derby era

	A Todd defending coolly, a Clough watching on, some attractive football and fans swathed in black-and-white retro scarves: Derby County rolled back the years in style on Wednesday night. Short of ploughing up the pitch to give it that authentic Baseball Ground feel and getting everyone to wear flares and tank-tops, Derby could not have done more to revive the spirit of the Seventies.         
	Pride Parks metallic rafters shook to the sound of Derby fans going absolutely hoarse with delight after the 1-0 win against Manchester United. The Journey Starts Now read one of the many mission statements around the ground, and Derby followers, fed a grim gruel of substandard football in recent years, will feel that more fulfilling times lie ahead.         
	The team was picked and prepared by David Lowe, the head of academy coaching, and his cunning deployment of Kris Commons in the hole set United a conundrum they never solved, but the spotlight inevitably fell on a man who has spent a decade avoiding it.         
	Nigel Clough visited the dressing-room beforehand, wishing Lowe and the players good luck and exhorting them to play to the maximum which they duly did. After an emotional salute to their new manager, Pride Park played a fanfare to the Commons man.         
	As Clough looked down from the directors box, Derby tore into the champions of England, Europe and the world, playing without fear, their spirits lifted by Cloughs arrival, their verve embodied by Commons. Given a free role in a 4-4-1-1 system by Lowe, Commons buzzed around behind Rob Hulse, working busily between the lines.         
	Derbys No. 7 was everywhere, racing through the middle, pushing down the right, taking responsibility at set-pieces and contributing the defining moment of this entertaining Carling Cup semi-final first leg.         
	When Mile Sterjovski laid the ball off to Commons 25 yards out with the clock touching the half-hour mark, the response evoked memories of more glorious times.         
	Here was an image for the fans scrapbooks, for the club archives. Here was Commons running onto the ball, ignoring Nemanja Vidics desperate attempt to block off the danger. Too late. Commons met the ball sweetly, sending it flying imperiously past Tomasz Kuszczak. Some goal.         
	Pride Park went potty. Derby fans appreciated the significance, even poignancy, of the occasion. Their last involvement in a domestic semi-final had been back in 1976, when Dave Mackays side were champions and they faced Tommy Dochertys United at Hillsborough in the FA Cup.         
	Commons strike was good but there was also huge promise in the contribution of Steve Davies, who had forced Vidic and Kuszczak into emergency clearances even before Derby had taken the lead. Andy Todd, who was out of favour under Paul Jewell, was recalled from Northampton Town by Lowe and excelled.         
	The theme of the day was living in the shadow of a famous father. Andy Todd will never defend with the elan of his father, Colin, but he formed a redoubtable barrier last night, one against which Carlos Tevez, Danny Welbeck and eventually even Wayne Rooney foundered. If Tevez wants to convince Sir Alex Ferguson to make his loan deal permanent, the Argentinian will need to play better than this.         
	United will presume they will overturn Derbys slim edge in the January 20 second leg but they were disappointing here, a frustration to their huge following who lent the game such a noisy and colourful backdrop. The players were just off the pace. Paul Scholes radar was on the blink while Anderson was all energy with no end product.         
	Unlike Commons. As the second half opened, he again showed his class, accelerating past Rafael da Silva, who responded by hauling him down. United gradually began to raise their game slightly and Roy Carroll reacted sharply to spring from his line and clear just before Nani arrived. The former United keeper then charged out to sweep up as Tevez came flying through.

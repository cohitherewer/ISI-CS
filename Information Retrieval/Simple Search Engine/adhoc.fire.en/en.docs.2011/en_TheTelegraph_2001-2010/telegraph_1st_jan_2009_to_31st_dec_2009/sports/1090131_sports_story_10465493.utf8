                                                     Proteas on top of the world
            A STAFF REPORTER              Johan Botha                      
	Calcutta: South Africa on Friday dethroned Australia as the number one ODI cricket team in the world though Ricky Pontings men will have an immediate chance to regain the top slot in the forthcoming home series against New Zealand.         
	The Proteas 4-1 series win put them ahead of Australia by a fraction of a ratings point.         
	The Proteas had already wrapped up the five-match series as they headed into Fridays final game at the WACA Ground, and after also winning the Test series, ensured a memorable tour finished on a high.         
	South Africa had been three ratings points behind Pontings men going into the fifth and final ODI of the series. They moved ahead by a fraction of a point for the first time since April 2008 when they briefly wrested the number-one spot from Australia.         
	The table is so tight at the top that victory in the first ODI against New Zealand will send Australia right back to where they have spent the vast majority of the past seven years since the rankings were devised, according to an ICC release.         
	Meanwhile, India are hovering just outside the top two and are now just five rating points behind South Africa and Australia after winning the first match of the five-ODI series in Sri Lanka.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhonis men will be doing their best to keep up the pressure on the top two with plenty of ODI cricket coming up on the horizon.         
	New Zealand are currently placed fourth in the ODI table followed by Pakistan at fifth.         
	England, currently touring the West Indies, are placed sixth followed by Sri Lanka at seventh.         
	At the other end of the table, Zimbabwe has moved up one place to 10th in the rankings after winning the opening two matches of their five-ODI series in Kenya.         
	Prosper Utseyas team has now beaten the home side in the two games in Mombasa and so heads to Nairobi full of confidence for the remaining three.         
	That means Ireland slipped to 11 th position while Kenya lost ratings points and stayed in 12th spot.         
	However, if Kenya were to win the remaining three matches, they would move to 11 th place, just one ratings point behind the Irish while Zimbabwe would fall all the way to 12th and last spot on the table. So theres still plenty to play for in the series.         
	Rankings         
	1. South Africa; 2. Australia; 3. India; 4. New Zealand; 5. Pakistan; 6. England; 7. Sri Lanka; 8. West Indies; 9. Bangladesh; 10. Zimbabwe; 11. Ireland; 12. Kenya.

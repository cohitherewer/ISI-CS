The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Strauss unhappy with ECB move 
                                                   Strauss unhappy with ECB move 
                      
	Melbourne: Clearly not a fan of the 40-over format, England captain Andrew Strauss has said banishing 50-over cricket from the domestic schedule could have dire consequences for the teams 2011 World Cup campaign.         
	England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) last week voted to switch to the 40-over game but Strauss, who believes one-dayers will survive the mounting pressure from Twenty20, said domestic cricket should mirror internationals.         
	Forty-over cricket is not radically different from 50-over cricket, but it just seems sensible to me that if youre playing 50-over cricket internationally and your domestic scene is a way of preparing people for international cricket, you should be playing the same game, Strauss said.At the moment, there is a future to 50-over cricket.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Workshop for players
                                                   Workshop for players
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Football Players Association of India (FPAI) will hold a workshop at the Parsee Club on Monday to help the players understand the nuances of a contract when the transfer season gets under way. The contract paper, as given by the clubs to the players, has drawn a lot of flak from all quarters.         
	So, the FPAIs idea of going for a workshop is a laudable move. Ushanath Banerjee, a former BCCI lawyer during the Jagmohan Dalmiya regime and at present legal head for the Asian region at FifPro, the worldwide representative body of professional footballers, will address the footballers. Banerjee has been with us since the days we started the FPAI and he has been kind enough to educate the players on the contract issue, FPAI CEO Sumit Mukherjee told The Telegraph on Friday.         
	Mukherjee said this workshop would be of immense help to the city-bred players. They are always at the receiving end. This workshop is a must for them. In fact we got a huge response when we organised spoken English classes for the city players, he said.         
	Whether this workshop will put an end to the contract imbroglio is debatable but theres no harm in at least trying from our end, Mukherjee made his point.

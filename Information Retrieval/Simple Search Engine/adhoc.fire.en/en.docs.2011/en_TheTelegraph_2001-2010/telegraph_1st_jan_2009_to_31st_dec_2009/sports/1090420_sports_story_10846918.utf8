                                                   Masterful Nadals famous fifth
                      
	Monte Carlo: Rafael Nadal became the first man to win the Monte Carlo Masters five times in a row when he beat Novak Djokovic 6-3 2-6 6-1 in Sundays final.         
	The Spanish world No. 1 underlined his status as hot favourite for a fifth consecutive French Open triumph at Roland Garros when the claycourt Grand Slam starts in five weeks. The 22-year-old improved his personal record against Djokovic to 12-4, but the Serb showed the colossus could be beaten when he managed to win the second set, the first Nadal has dropped in the principality since the 2006 final. First of all, congratulations to Novak anyway. A fifth victory here is a dream coming true. Thank you to everybody and see you next year, Nadal said in his post-match speech.         
	Congratulations to Rafa and his team. You guys are unbelievable, well done again, said Djokovic, who has lost his seven matches on clay against Nadal.         
	Nobody has matched Nadals performance in the Monte Carlo tournament since tennis turned professional in 1968.         
	Briton Reggie Doherty won the event six times, from its inception in 1897 until 1899 and from 1902 to 1904, while New Zealander Anthony Wilding won it four times in a row from 1911.         
	Djokovic came out on centre court all guns blazing, opening a 3-1 lead as Nadal was struggling with his serve. (Reuters)

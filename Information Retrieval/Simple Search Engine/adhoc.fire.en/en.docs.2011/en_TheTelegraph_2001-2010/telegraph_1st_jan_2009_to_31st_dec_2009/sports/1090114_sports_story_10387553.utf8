The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team India to play 5 ODIs, 1 Twenty20 in Sri Lanka
                                                   Team India to play 5 ODIs, 1 Twenty20 in Sri Lanka
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Colombo: The Indian cricket teams tour of Sri Lanka, featuring five one-day Internationals and a Twenty20 match, may start as early as the third week of this month.         
	According to sources, the ODIs will almost surely kick-off in Dambulla either on January 27 or 28. The second ODI too will be held there, in all probability on January 30. The focus will then shift to the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, with the last three ODIs tentatively scheduled for February 2, 5 and 8.         
	The one-off Twenty20 is likely to be held on February 10, again at the Premadasa.         
	The formal announcement is expected within a couple of days, but a general agreement was reached during the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary N. Srinivasans meeting with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) officials in Colombo on Tuesday.         
	Significantly, Srinivasan also met the countrys President Mahinda Rajapakse during the day. Details though, were not available.         
	We have agreed to visit Sri Lanka and play five one-day Internationals and one Twenty20 match before we go to New Zealand for our scheduled tour. The exact dates will be finalised soon and will be released jointly, Srinivasan said at a press conference.         
	Srinivasan also said that sports minister Gamini Lokuge has assured the BCCI of the availability of the Sri Lankan cricketers for the second edition of the Indian Premier League, scheduled to be held in April.         
	We are grateful to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and to the minister for assuring us that the Sri Lankan players will be released for the IPL. An understanding on this will be inked on the day we play our Twenty20 match here, the BCCI secretary said.         
	He also thanked the SLC for supporting the BCCI stand on the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL).         
	We are also thankful to the Sri Lanka Cricket for their very firm expression of support to the BCCI stand with regard to the ICL. Now we look forward to an interesting ODI series and a Twenty20 game in Sri Lanka when our team comes here, he said.         
	Srinivasan dismissed reports that BCCI put pressure on its Sri Lankan counterpart to get rid of Arjuna Ranatunga from the helm of the SLC interim committee.         
	There was no pre-condition. We have no right to interfere or make any suggestions, comments or requests on the internal matters of SLC. The Sri Lanka Cricket is as sovereign as the BCCI, Srinivasan said.         
	Ranatunga was against Lanka players taking part in the IPL this year and was, in fact, negotiating a tour of England which would have coincided with the BCCI-backed Twenty20 event.         
	All Sri Lankan players were made available during the first season of IPL. There was no hesitation at all and we actually thanked Sri Lanka Cricket for their gesture at that time and even this year none of the players have indicated that there was any pressure or anything. So I think that impression is wrong. There was no linen that was dirty, he said.         
	Asked how much of BCCIs recent losses would be offset by this series, Srinivasan said: We have already indicated after our last working committee meeting that there was a loss of revenue to the BCCI of Rs 122 crore. Still the BCCI will have a surplus of income over expenditure.         
	We are not coming here with the intention of making any money. The domestic rights, when we come here, belong to Sri Lanka Cricket and not to us. So we are coming here to honour the request of our friend and neighbour, he said.         
	Asked if BCCI was miffed with SLC for touring Pakistan following the Mumbai terror attacks, Srinivasan said: Not at all. As I said, BCCI is sovereign and SLC is sovereign. It is upto Sri Lanka cricket to tour as they will.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Flintoff did not mask injury: ECB
                                                   Flintoff did not mask injury: ECB
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The England and Wales Cricket Board said that Andrew Flintoff did not have repeated cortisone injections to mask the extent of a knee injury and that he still hopes to round off his Test career against Australia at The Oval.         
	The 31-year-old all-rounder, who helped England take a 1-0 lead from the first three matches, was ruled out of the fourth Test that started Friday because of the problem and could face further surgery.         
	The ECB said that Flintoff only had fluid injections into the knee ahead of the second and third Tests, with cortisone being used only to help reduce inflammation.         
	The initial injections were to replace the fluid that helps lubricate the knee joint.         
	Andrew has shown great determination and selflessness making a conscious decision to push through discomfort in order to help the England team reclaim the Ashes, the ECB said in a statement Friday.         
	This is in the knowledge that a further operation is a possibility.         
	Flintoff is set to retire from Test cricket after the series to concentrate on limited-overs matches and reduce the strain upon his body.

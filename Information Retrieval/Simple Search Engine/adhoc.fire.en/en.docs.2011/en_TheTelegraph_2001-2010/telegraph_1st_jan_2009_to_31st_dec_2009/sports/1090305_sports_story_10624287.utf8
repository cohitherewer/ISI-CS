The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Security was less in Tests, says Dilshan
                                                   Security was less in Tests, says Dilshan
                      
	Colombo: Those few minutes seemed to still haunt the Sri Lankan players, some 18 hours after they landed in Colombo early Wednesday morning by a chartered flight.         
	The cricketers consider themselves simply lucky to safely return home after the terrorist attack, which left six of them, including captain Mahela Jayawardene and spinner Ajantha Mendis, injured.         
	Everyone is safe. Nothing bad has happened, Jayawardene said. It was a terrible incident. We were going to the ground and were ambushed on the way. We were lucky to get away. We were in shock, but very very happy to be back home, Kumar Sangakkara said.         
	But the 31-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman wants to move ahead with the game. The best thing we can do is go on playing cricket, he added.         
	Batsman Tillekaratne Dilshan recalled those terrifying moments: It was a cracker-like sound, I didnt take it seriously... A shot landed very close to the driver. I then realised we were being fired at.         
	I heard some of the players shouting that they have been hit. The firing continued for more than three minutes. The driver was in shock and the bus was stationary for over a minute. I asked the driver to drive fast and we left the site, Dilshan recalled.         
	Dilshan said the security cover for the two-match Test series was relatively less than what was provided to the visitors during the ODI matches.         
	I think, security arrangement for the Test tour was relatively relaxed when compared to the three-match ODI series. There was a massive security cover for the ODIs, but I think they may not have expected such attacks on cricketers, Dilshan said.         
	Emotions ran high after the cricketers arrival at the airport as their relatives greeted and hugged each other with sodden eyes. Dilshan was seen embracing his little son after getting down from the special chartered flight.         
	We all got scared. At that time all that I could think was who had been shot and who escaped. The driver of the bus saved us, spinner Muttiah Muralidharan said.         
	But the 31-year-old cricketer wants to move ahead with the game, leaving the incident behind.         
	The Lankan cricketers also paid tribute to the police officials who laid their lives shielding the visitors and driver of the bus who held his nerve to drive away the vehicle.         
	We pay tribute to the ones who sacrificed their lives only to save the lives of our cricketers, Jayawardene said.           (PTI)

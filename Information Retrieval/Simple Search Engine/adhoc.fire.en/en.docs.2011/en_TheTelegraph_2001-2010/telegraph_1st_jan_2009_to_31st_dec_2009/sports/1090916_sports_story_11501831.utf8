            OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT      
	Calcutta: Three of the 10 horses  Leading Edge, Aymaras and Shanghai Gal  lined up for the 1,100m Bachelors Wedding Cup, on Wednesday, may fight out the issue. Leading Edge has done fairly well in her last three outings this season while Aymaras is going from strength-to-strength. Shanghai Gal, also a facile winner in her last start, is enjoying a considerable pull at the weights from the two named horses. It is going to be a close a contest but the handicap advantage tilts the scales in favour of the Imtiaz Saits ward Shanghai Gal who will be ridden by an in-form apprentice Kishore Kadam.          
	Jockey C. Alford is otherwise expected to rule the six-event card. The last runs of his two rides, Acridian and Chinatown, may be ignored. The two horses are expected to show their mettle in their respective events  the Sunlion Handicap and the Arthur B. Handicap  both over 1,400 meters. Alfords Averill, too, has potential to lift the 1,000m Contralto Handicap.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

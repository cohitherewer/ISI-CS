The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagans chance to regroup
                                                   Bagans chance to regroup
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: With due respect to Viva Kerala and their noble intentions, Mohun Bagan, for sure, wont complain to the All India Football Federation about the third round I-League fixtures. Missing nine players  five of them from the first 11  due to card problems and injuries, the last thing this beleaguered Bagan team would have wanted was a Dempo or a Churchill Brothers as their Monday opponents.         
	So a Viva Kerala, billed as one of the whipping boys of the league, should be a welcome relief for the Edeh Chidis. It is a perfect opportunity to bounce back after losing the first two matches, and to boost the teams morale before the October 25 derby.         
	Such is Bagans predicament that even Branco Cardozo, who scored a stunner during the loss to JCT, is out serving a suspension. His place will be taken by Suraj Mondal.         
	With no Deepak Mondal (red card against JCT ruled him out) and NS Manju (long-term injury) at the centre of defence, Bencharifa will fall back on Sagram Mandi to partner Rakesh Masih. Surkumar Singh will be back after serving a suspension, but N. Mohanraj is yet to recover from the injury he picked up against JCT. There is no Habibur Rehman as well, so in comes Biswajit Saha..

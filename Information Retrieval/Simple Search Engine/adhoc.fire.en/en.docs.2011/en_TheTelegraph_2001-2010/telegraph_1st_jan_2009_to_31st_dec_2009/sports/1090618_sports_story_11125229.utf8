The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis wants to win it for Woolmer
                                                   Younis wants to win it for Woolmer
                      
	Nottingham: Pakistan skipper Younis Khan, is determined to claim the Twenty20 World Cup for their former coach Bob Woolmer, who died in mysterious circumstances after the teams loss to Ireland during the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean.         
	He was an inspiring person, a father figure for me and the team. We all still miss him and if we win the World Cup I will dedicate that final game to him, Younis said.         
	Younis followed Woolmers advice in their final Super Eight match against Ireland on Monday by shuffling the batting order.         
	He had sent Kamran Akmal and Shahid Afridi up the order in their comfortable 39-run win against the minnows.         
	I learned a lot of things from Bob and he was always flexible, especially in the batting order. I thought we needed a couple of in-form batsmen for big games like the semi-final and final, he said.         
	Younis admitted that Pakistan are slow starters but felt his side was peaking at right time.         
	Everybody knows were slow starters. We take some time and we need some time for ourselves and now we are just two wins away from winning the World Cup, he said.         
	I still believe we were 20 runs short (against Ireland). It would be good if we could put 180 or 200 on the board because in the semi-finals there will be good teams against us and its not possible to win all the time scoring 150, he added.

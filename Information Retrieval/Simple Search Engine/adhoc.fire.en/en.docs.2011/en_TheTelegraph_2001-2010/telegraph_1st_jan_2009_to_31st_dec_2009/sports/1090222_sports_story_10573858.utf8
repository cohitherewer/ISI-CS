The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karim holds cards close to chest
                                                   Karim holds cards close to chest
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Its difficult to rattle Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa. Barring the initial phase of the I-League when Bagan were not going great guns, the Moroccan has been as cool as a cucumber. You probe him with searching questions or prod him about his rivals, Bencharifa remains as detached as ever.         
	In a way, Bencharifa is just like his team in the I-League  not so exuberant but very effective. So, on the eve of the I-League clash between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan, however hard the media tried to get at least a quote which would make their day, Bencharifa smilingly avoided getting into any controversy.         
	He might be just nine months into the Maidan cauldron but Bencharifa has surely picked up the art of dealing with quote-hungry scribes. So is this a match between the two Bs  Bencharifa and (Subhas) Bhowmick? Its not a battle between two coaches. Its about the main actors on the stage, he said with a smile.         
	When asked whether there would be a change in the starting line-up  the evening practice session hinted that Rakesh Masih may make way for Lalkamal Bhowmick  Bencharifa expectedly refused to divulge his scheme. Dont get surprised if there is a change and dont get surprised if there isnt, was his riposte.         
	Bencharifa said Sundays match and the away clash against Churchill Brothers on March 8 would decide whether Bagan can go the distance.         
	The Moroccan said that P.C. Lalawmpuiya would be in the 18-member squad.         
	Jose Ramirez Barreto, meanwhile, survived a scare when the screws of the front wheel of his car were found to be loose. The problem was rectified before any damage was done.

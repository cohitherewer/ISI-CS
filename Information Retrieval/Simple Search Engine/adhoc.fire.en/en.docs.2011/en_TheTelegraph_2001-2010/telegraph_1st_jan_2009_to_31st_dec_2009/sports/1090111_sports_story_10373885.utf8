The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tough task for Strauss: John
                                                   Tough task for Strauss: John
                      
	London: Handling a divided England team that, in Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen, has two former captains on board, will be a test of the newly-appointed skipper Andrew Strausss diplomatic skills, feels former Australia coach John Buchanan.         
	Admitting that Strauss, with whom he has worked in Middlesex, was the man best suited for the job, Buchanan said managing Pietersen would be the toughest task for the new skipper. It will be an interesting time for Strauss with two former captains in the side, and a third  Michael Vaughan  still floating around, Buchanan said. How will he deal with a disgruntled Kevin Pietersen after everything that has happened? The ball is in Pietersens court now. It is a question of how he handles the situation and whether he can be a team player.         
	There have been plenty of past players whose characters didnt fit into the team dynamic, but whose performance outweighed the disadvantages of having them there. From the England teams perspective, Pietersen has always been one of those players. It is up to the selectors to look at the cost-benefit ratio, he was quoted as saying in an English daily.         
	Pietersen recently relinquished the England captaincy after a feud with coach Peter Moores, who was also axed. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) is expected to announce a new interim coaching team soon after naming Strauss as the skipper of the one-day team.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nevada order for Manny and Floyd
                                                                                                                       7                                      Nevada order for Manny and Floyd
                      
	Las Vegas: The head of the Nevada boxing commission ordered Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather Jr. to submit to urine tests Monday as a way of trying to break the impasse that has threatened to derail their proposed March 13 megafight.         
	Pacquiao and Mayweather must submit to the tests within 48 hours or face possible fines or suspension by the Nevada Athletic commission.         
	That at least starts the ball rolling, said Keith Kizer, the commissions executive director.         
	Indeed, the two sides signalled late in the day that there could be room for a compromise after Mayweathers representatives said there was footage on a television programme that showed Pacquiao having blood taken 14 days before his knockout win over Ricky Hatton.         
	Mayweathers promoter, Richard Schaefer, said he was told that Top Rank representatives would be talking to Pacquiao in the Philippines to see what cutoff date he would agree to on blood testing.         
	Schaefer said there was a possibility the two sides could compromise somewhere between Mayweathers demand for testing up until the weigh-in and the 14 days Pacquiao had blood taken prior to the Hatton fight.         
	We were at two days and I assume Pacquiao is at 14 days, Schaefer said.         
	Lets see if somehow there can be a compromise found that maintains the integrity of the tests.         
	The urine tests fall under an out-of-competition testing regulation which went into effect last year and allows state boxing authorities to order boxers to comply.           (AGENCIES)

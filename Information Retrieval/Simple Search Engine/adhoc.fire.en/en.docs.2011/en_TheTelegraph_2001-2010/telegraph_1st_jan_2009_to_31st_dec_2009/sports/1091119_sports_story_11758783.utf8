                                                                                                                                     McLaren get a dream team
  - World champion Button joins Hamilton in all-British line-up       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES            Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button                                 
	McLaren have announced the signing of reigning Formula One world champion Jenson Button on a multi-year deal that will see the Briton paired with Lewis Hamilton from the start of the 2010 season.         
	Button will line-up alongside Hamilton after parting company with reigning constructors champions Brawn GP, who were the subject of a takeover by Mercedes-Benz earlier this week.         
	Vodafone McLaren Mercedes is delighted to announce the signing of the reigning world champion Jenson Button to a multi-year deal, the team said in a statement.         
	He will be partnered by the 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton, who will be embarking on his fourth consecutive season as a McLaren Mercedes driver.         
	The deal marks the first time in Formula One history that a team has started the new season with a line-up featuring the most recent two successive world champions, and is the first pairing of two British world champions since Graham Hill partnered Jim Clark at Lotus in 1968.         
	Button, who has reportedly agreed a three-year deal worth 6 million a season, moves to the Woking-based team after a hugely successful campaign with Brawn which delivered six Grand Prix wins and his maiden world title.         
	Its always a difficult decision to leave a team when youve been there for so long, said Button. But life is all about challenges  and, most important of all, its about challenging yourself.         
	So, although I won the world championship with Brawn GP last year, and Ill never forget that, I was always adamant that I wanted to continue to set myself fresh challenges.         
	So thats why Ive decided to join McLaren. You cant help but be affected by this teams phenomenal history.         
	McLaren is one of the greats of world sport, and its achievements and list of past champions read like a whos who of Formula One  Emerson Fittipaldi, James Hunt, Niki Lauda, Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna, Mika Hakkinen and, of course, my new teammate Lewis Hamilton.         
	Ive followed the McLaren team ever since I was a small boy, and it feels unbelievable to finally be a part of it.         
	Hamilton, who won the world title with McLaren in 2008 in only his second season in F1, welcomed the arrival of his fellow Englishman, and reserved special praise for the outgoing Heikki Kovalainen, his teammate of the last two seasons who must now find a drive elsewhere.         
	He said: Its fantastic news that Jenson has decided to join McLaren.         
	Im looking forward to working with him and our engineers to make sure we kick off the 2010 season with a car thats competitive enough to win the world championship.         
	I want to send my best wishes for the future to my 2008-09 teammate and now good friend Heikki Kovalainen, who is one of the nicest human beings Ive ever met.         
	I already know Jenson, and we get on very well together. We both really want our team to succeed.         
	Although well be pushing each other hard, Im sure well very quickly establish a great working relationship.         
	Hes an exceptional driver: very controlled and very smooth, and he has a real depth of knowledge and experience. I think well complement each other very well.

                                                   We will give our best vs Hull, insists Ferguson 
            James Ducker                            
	Sir Alex Ferguson believes that Hull Citys fellow relegation candidates will benefit from Manchester United not fielding their best team at the KC Stadium on Sunday after securing the Premier League title.         
	Middlesbrough, Newcastle United and Sunderland are fearful that Hull will be given an easier ride, with Ferguson planning to field a weakened team, rather than risking his best players before the Champions League final against Barcelona in Rome on Wednesday.         
	It is possible that none of the players who start against Hull will be in Fergusons first XI against Barcelona, but while that may alarm supporters of the three troubled North East clubs, the United manager believes that Cristiano Ronaldo and company might be more concerned about avoiding injury, with Rome in mind, than winning if they faced Phil Browns team.         
	Asked if there would be a danger of players tip-toeing around tackles for fear of getting hurt if he fielded his best team against Hull, Ferguson said: Its possible if you have a European Cup final on the Wednesday. You get one of these 50-50 tackles and the crowd is roaring, you could get a somersault over the shoulder in the first tackle and you say, That is enough for me. It is a fact of life.         
	Rio Ferdinand, the England defender who has missed Uniteds past three matches with a calf injury, could be the only player who features on Sunday and starts in Rome. However, regardless of the accusations that may be levelled at Ferguson if Hull prevail, the manager has vowed to uphold the integrity of the Premier League while emphasising that he must put the best interests of his team first.         
	Our responsibility is to win the European Cup and everyone is aware of that, he said. Thats why we are talking about changes. The modern-day game is a squad game and everyone uses it. The players wouldnt forgive me if I played the strongest team on Sunday. They would say What? It would be the best thing that could happen to Hull, really. They would relish that. The rest of the league may think thats good because United are playing their strongest team, but it could be the worst thing that could happen to us.         
	Against Barcelona, Ferguson seems likely to stick with the team who overcame Arsenal in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final at the Emirates Stadium, with the exception of Ryan Giggs, who may come in for the suspended Darren Fletcher, but the United manager is confident that the prospect of reaching 90 points will be motivation enough for those who do play against Hull.         
	It is definitely not a weak team, he said. A strong team will play against Hull. It is a team in some cases with fantastic potential and in a lot of cases the team will have experience. We cannot match our record of 91 points but we could get 90 and that is a fantastic total. One game can decide everyones fate and that is not lost on me. Dont worry about Sunday. I can assure you, dont worry.         
	Ferguson was so concerned about the scrutiny his impending team selection has attracted that he considered ringing Gareth Southgate, Alan Shearer and Ricky Sbragia, the managers of Middlesbrough, Newcastle and Sunderland respectively, to reassure them, before dismissing the idea because they must know we will be doing our best.more who played.

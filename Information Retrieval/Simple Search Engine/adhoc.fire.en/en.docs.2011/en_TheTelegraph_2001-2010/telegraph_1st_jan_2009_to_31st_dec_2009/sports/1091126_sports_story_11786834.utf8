The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bowlers turn to get a grip
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bowlers turn to get a grip
            KUSHAN SARKAR                      
	Kanpur: If someone wanted to sum up how the Green Park track has behaved for the major part of the first two days, he has to look no further than the dismissals of Rahul Dravid and Tillekaratne Dilshan.         
	Dravid, who completed his 28th Test century (now on 11,182, he passed Allan Borders Test aggregate of 11,174 runs), was run out in the most unfortunate manner.         
	Left-arm spinner Rangana Herath (5/121) failed to hold on to a sharp caught and bowled chance off V.V.S. Laxman. The ball hit the stumps with Dravid out of his crease after having backed up a bit too far.         
	Perhaps it was the only way the Lankans could have dismissed him as neither the pacers nor the spinners were able to bother him during his chanceless knock of 144.         
	Dilshans dismissal was diametrically opposite. It was the first ball of the Sri Lankan innings. Zaheer Khan bowled a loosener down the leg-side and Dilshan went for an atrocious shot when the delivery could well have been left alone. The result  a simple catch for debutant Pragyan Ojha at mid-on.         
	Thats how the script has looked to unfold over the major part of the two days; either you are really unlucky or play a bad shot to get out.         
	However, the situation was slightly different in the last hour of the day, when the Indian spinners were in operation.         
	A few cracks and rough spots on either side of the wicket were expected after the Indians took 154 overs to score 642 in the first innings.         
	Harbhajan, in his sixth over, got one to land on the rough when Sangakkara was batting. The ball suddenly took off and Mahendra Singh Dhoni couldnt do anything as it went for four byes.         
	Although Kumar Sangakkara (30 batting) and opener Tharanga Paranavitana (30 batting) negotiated the 23.5 overs to take the score to 66 for one, that particular delivery will definitely make both Harbhajan and his skipper feel good.         
	A few of Harbhajans deliveries even kept low and Sangakkara survived a couple of confident leg-before shouts.         
	For the next three days, the experienced Lanka batsmen will have to show a different skill. The art of survival. As one of the Day I heroes, Gautam Gambhir, pointed out at the end of days play. Only one team can lose this match from here. That is Sri Lanka.         
	Earlier in the day, India lost six wickets for 29 runs when they looked all set for a score in excess of 700. Dravid completed his well-deserved century with a nice drive off Chanaka Welegedara.         
	After completing his century, he lifted Herath for a straight six.         
	Sachin Tendulkar, on the other hand, was a bit bogged down. He got a reprieve on 30 when Dilshan, fielding at short mid-wicket, dropped a tough chance off Ajantha Mendis.         
	To break free of the shackles, he hit Mendis for a maximum over long-off. Then, trying for a repeat of the shot off the same bowler, he failed to clear Samaraweera at mid-off.         
	Laxman (63, 5x4) and Yuvraj Singh (67, 4x4, 2x6) enjoyed a fruitful 102-run fifth-wicket partnership and it looked like India would easily surpass their highest total, on Indian soil, of 676 (posted against the same opponents at the same venue).         
	While Laxman hit a few wristy on-drives Yuvraj looked good against Muttiah Muralidharan amp; Co. One of his two sixes was a huge hit off Murali over deep mid-wicket.         
	Herath, who had a rather forgettable first day, came back strongly during that phase.         
	He induced Laxman to go for the big one but the right-hander couldnt clear Dilshan at mid-off.         
	Dhoni (4) was deceived by an armer that went through the gap between his bat and pad. Yuvraj, running out of partners, was caught at short mid-wicket by Sangakkara off Mendis. The onus is now on Harbhajan and Ojha to deliver the goods. They have enough time to do so.

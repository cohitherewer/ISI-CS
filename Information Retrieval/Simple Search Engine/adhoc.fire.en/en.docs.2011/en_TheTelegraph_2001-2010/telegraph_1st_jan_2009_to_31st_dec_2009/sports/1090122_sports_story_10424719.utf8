The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Foreign clubs still some distance off
                                                     Foreign clubs still some distance off
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Sunil                           
	New Delhi: The recent hype over the prospect of Indian footballers clinching deals with clubs in Europe and the United States may turn out to be a damp squib, feels Mahindra United coach Derrick Pereira.         
	The Mumbai-based coach, one of Indias first to get the AFC Professional coaching license, said that the agents of most of the Indian players were yet to find a club for their clients.         
	If you ask me personally, I am very happy that these players are trying to play abroad, Pereira told The Telegraph. If it really happens then there cannot be anything better than that.         
	Three Indian footballers  Steven Dias (Mahindra United), Sunil Chetri and Subrata Paul (both East Bengal)  are currently in the news as they have signed deals with their agents to play abroad.         
	Pereira said he had spoken to one of the agents himself and found he was yet to find clubs for these players.         
	It is true that the players have signed deals with their respective agents. But as far as I know the agents are yet to find specific clubs for our boys. After signing the deals, the agents are now talking to different clubs and trying to get trials for their clients.         
	East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick, however, said Sunil Chetri was definitely going to appear for a trial for Coventry City in England. Some of the reports said that he was going there only to watch a game. That is wrong, the veteran coach commented.         
	Bhowmick described Chetri as one of the most exciting players in India. I am sure he will be able to succeed there. I will feel proud if a player from East Bengal plays on the big stage. I shall have no problem in releasing him.         
	The Mahindra management has a different idea about releasing their contracted players for greener pastures. They are welcome to go but they should know the I-League is currently on here, said a Mahindra official. Still, we can release Steven Dias in the middle of the season if he really gets a call from any club.

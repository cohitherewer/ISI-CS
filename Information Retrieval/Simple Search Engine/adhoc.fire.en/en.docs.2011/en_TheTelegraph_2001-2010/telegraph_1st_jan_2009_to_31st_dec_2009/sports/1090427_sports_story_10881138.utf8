	Port Elizabeth: Tillekaratne Dilshan struck a match-winning unbeaten 67 to help the Delhi DareDevils beat the Royal Challengers Bangalore by six wickets and register their third consecutive victory in the Indian Premier League (IPL) here Sunday.         
	After the early dismissal of their openers, Dilshans 47-ball knock, studded with five boundaries and two sixes, won it for the DareDevils.         
	Earlier, skipper Kevin Pietersen (37) and Mark Boucher (36) helped the Royal Challengers post a modest 149 for seven after opting to bat.         
	With this victory, the DareDevils remained unbeaten in the tournament with three victories from as many matches while the Royal Challengers are lying at the bottom with just one win out of five games.         
	Chasing a modest 150 for victory, the DareDevils once again lost skipper Virender Sehwag (7) early after he mistimed a pull off Pankaj Singh (2/31) in the second over to offer an easy catch to Pietersen at mid-on. But a determined Dilshan first hit R. Vinay Kumar for a four in the third over and then struck a cheeky six over the keepers head off Pankaj in the next over. Dilshan, however, got a reprieve on 18 when Pankaj grounded a difficult chance off his own bowling in the sixth over, but made amends a ball later by having Gambhir caught behind.         
	After the early burst, both Dilshan and last match centurion AB de Villiers (21 off 34) found the going tough against the spin duo of Anil Kumble and young KP Appanna. However, The duo kept the scoreboard ticking with ones and twos. Appanna broke the 42-run stand between the two, cleaning up De Velliers stumps with a gem of a delivery that turned viciously.         
	Needing 61 off 36 deliveries, next man in Dinesh Karthik (12) began with a six off Kallis but perished in the next over. Dilshan, however, was in no mood to give up as he hit Kallis for a huge six over mid-wicket and then some sloppy fielding in the deep gave Mithun Manhas two easy boundaries to take 19 runs in the 17th over.         
	The Royal Challengers lost the grip of the match in the last four overs, thanks to some poor fielding. With 15 needed from the last two overs, Pietersen called back his best bowler Pankaj, but the move hardly had any effect on Dilshan. The DareDevils sealed the match with four balls to spare.           (PTI)

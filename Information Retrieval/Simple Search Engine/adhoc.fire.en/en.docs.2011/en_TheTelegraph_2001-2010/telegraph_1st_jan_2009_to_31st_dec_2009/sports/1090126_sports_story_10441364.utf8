The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev ends tied 16th
                                                   Jeev ends tied 16th
                      
	Doha: Jeev Milkha Singh saved his best for the last day and turned in a flawless five-under 67 to sign off tied 16th but Jyoti Randhawas first over-par card of the week saw him finish a disappointing tied 50th in the European Tours Qatar Masters here on Sunday.         
	Jeev finished with a tournament total of nine-under 279, while Randhawa was two-under 286 overall. In a fantastic final-round show, Jeev opened with a birdie on the first and after parring seven holes, he winded up his front-nine with a birdie again to make the turn two-under.         
	It was smooth sailing for Jeev in the back-nine as well and he picked up a stroke on the 14th before a sensational eagle on the par-four 16th completed a brilliant day for him.         
	Spaniard Alvaro Quiros clinched the title after a 69 in the final round left him three shots clear of the field at 19-under 269. Swede Henrik Stenson (68) shared the second spot with South African Louis Oosthuizen (71).

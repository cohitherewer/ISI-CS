	Doha: Caroline Wozniacki saved a match point in the final set and beat Victoria Azarenka 1-6, 6-4, 7-5 Wednesday in the group stage of the WTA Championships.         
	The players broke each other eight straight times in the third set, and Azarenka wasted a match point at 5-4. Wozniacki finally held serve before breaking for 6-5 after Azarenka was docked a point for smashing her racket. She sealed the win with a service winner after two hours, 58 minutes. It was the 19-year-old Danes first match in the tournament, while Azarenka defeated Jelena Jankovic in her opener on Tuesday.         
	World No.1 Dinara Safina was forced to quit in her opening round-robin match against Jelena Jankovic walking off in tears with a back injury at 1-1 in the first set.         
	Safina, who arrived in Doha with a slender lead over Serena Williams in the rankings, needs to do better or match the Americans performance at the season-ender to become the first Russian woman to end the year a world No.1.         
	On Tuesday, Serena Williams stayed on course to end the year as the world No.1 when she beat Russias Svetlana Kuznetsova 7-6, 7-5 after sister Venus suffered a shock defeat. Second-ranked Serena, who must better Dinara Safinas performance here to snatch the No.1 spot, served 11 aces under the Khalifa Stadium floodlights to get the better of the French Open champion who led 6-4 in the first-set tiebreak.         
	Venus lost 6-3, 6-7, 2-6 to Elena Dementieva, the third Russian competing at the season-ending showpiece, in the days outstanding contest.         
	Eleven-time Grand Slam champion Serena, bidding to end the year top of the WTA rankings for the first time since 2002, was far from her best in a scrappy slugfest against Kuznetsova.         
	With the match starting late, only a sprinkling of fans remained in the 7,000-seater Centre Court and the subdued atmosphere appeared to affect both players as they regularly found the net in high humidity.         
	Kuznetsova looked poised to win the opening set when she came back from 1-3 down in the tiebreak to lead 6-4 but a Williams winner and an ace helped the American snuff out the danger and she won the next two points to move ahead.         
	At that point I thought I had ruined it for myself because I missed an easy shot to go 4-1 up in the breaker, Williams, who needed treatment on her ankle in the second set, told reporters.         
	World No.3 Kuznetsova, yet to survive the round-robin stage in four appearances at the Championships, gifted Serena a break of serve at 5-5 in a tight second set with a double fault, effectively sealing her fate.         
	Both Williams sisters should have been celebrating victories but Venus, the defending champion, was thrown off track by an inspired Dementieva who ended a five-year wait for only her third career victory against the American in 12 meetings.         
	Twice Venus was a break up in the second set, having strolled through the first, and she served for the match at 6-5 only for Dementieva to break back with a searing backhand pass. A Venus double fault handed Dementieva the second set tiebreak and the Russian, making her ninth appearance at the Championships in 10 years, did not look back.         
	The last time I beat her was a long time ago. After the last match we played in Stanford, I was feeling so miserable, Dementieva told reporters. I was really looking forward to play against Venus one more time. (Agencies)

                                                   Dhoni: Cant be world beaters in a flash 
                      
	Johannesburg: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni Saturday said that his team couldnt be expected to become the worlds best side in a matter of days.         
	Its not like, we can be world beaters in seven days. We accept that. But if we can improve our standards by 10 to 15 per cent If the fielders can push their effort by 20 per cent, it would be good. Thats realistic, Dhoni said while addressing a pre-tournament press conference.         
	Team India play a warm-up tie against New Zealand on Sunday before the Champions Trophy commences on Tuesday. New Zealand, who were comprehensively beaten by India in the recently concluded Compaq Cup in Sri Lanka, lost their first warm-up match against local side Warriors.         
	The Indians, for a brief while, grabbed the No. 1 spot in the ICC ODI rankings when they beat the Black Caps in Sri Lanka, but Dhoni doesnt consider it to be one of the goals for his side.         
	I dont care about rankings. I dont think any cricketer who comes on the field cares about rankings, Dhoni said.         
	He, however, conceded that his sides fielding standard needs to improve considerably if they harboured any wish to do well at the Champions Trophy.         
	Our fielding standards, compared to what we had in Australia in 2007, is now very different. A lot of it has to do because of different conditions in which cricketers come up, Dhoni said.         
	The present generation of cricketers are much better in sliding and throwing themselves on the field. The National Cricket Academy and all those camps have helped, the wicketkeeper-batsman added.         
	Dismissing suggestions that one-day cricket was losing its appeal after the advent of Twenty20, Dhoni said: . Personally, I love one-day cricket. Its interesting and demands a lot of flexibility in terms of technique and patience.         
	The Indians face Pakistan in a hugely anticipated encounter at the Centurion on Saturday.         
	Coach Gary Kirsten said: We want to be as well prepared as we can be.         
	Asked about the younger Indian batsmens susceptibility to short-pitched bowling, Kirsten said that they were adapting gradually.         
	The South African also termed Rahul Dravid as an asset as he said: The return of Dravid will help. He is a good player of fast bowling He will be an asset to us.

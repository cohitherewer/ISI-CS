The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I-League back on TFA radar 
                                                     I-League back on TFA radar 
            SUDIPTO GUPTA            Thapa                           
	Calcutta: Whats common between Bobby Charlton, Bill Foulkes, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Gary Neville? They are Manchester Uniteds top-five all-time appearance makers and, more importantly, they are all products of the clubs youth academy.         
	Thats how important an academy that nurtures young talent into chiselled weapons can be.         
	The Tata Football Academy has been the flag-bearer in honing young soccer talents into readymade professionals in this country for more than two decades.         
	Only on Thursday, they created a ripple beating East Bengal 3-1 in the IFA Shield.         
	But, then, not everything is picture perfect with the noble initiative. Like yesteryear great Shyam Thapa, the newly appointed technical advisor of the academy, pointed out that inspite of arduous efforts, they havent been able to produce another Bhaichung Bhutia.         
	Another prominent problem has been the fact that, over the years, many a young promise failed to achieve a full bloom. And, what has been a bigger worry is the fact that the case has deteriorated in the recent times.         
	There was a time when players like Carlton Chapman, Rennedy Singh, Dipendu Biswas, Kalyan Chowbey, Deepak Mondal, Syed Rahim Nabi made a successful transition from being a TFA cadet to a successful professional player at the club level.         
	But of late, that has changed. For instance, Mohun Bagan lapped up eight TFA graduates last year but save Rakesh Masih, the others have faded into obscurity, failing to make it to the first XI. Similar had been the case of India and Churchill Brothers defender Gourmangi Singh, whose career was revived only after national coach Bob Houghton pulled him out of anonymity.         
	According to Thapa, the lack of maturity has been the chief reason. The young boys get used to the academy set-up . But once they step into the professional circuit, cut-throat competition often damages their potential. They lack the maturity to cope up with the pressure, he sums up.         
	Dipendu, who plays for Mohammedan Sporting, echoes Thapa. Maturity has been the real problem. You cant expect a 19-year-old to be an expert in handling pressures. In our case, we were simply lucky that things clicked, he says.         
	Then what could be the solution to preserve such young talents in a country, who are 149 in the latest Fifa rankings?         
	As the technical advisor, I have suggested the management that we play the I-LeagueTFA chief Satish Pillai has assured me that something concrete would be done in this aspect Thapa informed.         
	TFA, in fact, had played in the second division of the National Football League in the 2005-06 season and were the deserving winners. But eventually they didnt play in the premier division as the All India Football Federation ruled that, being an academy, they didnt fulfil the required norms.         
	But Thapa added that they had that bit in the mind and they had plans of forming the Tata Football Club to play in the I-League. We definitely have plans, but it wont happen this season as the present batch will be graduating out in March 2010. Give us a year and I assure you that we will play the second division I-League again, he said.         
	Dipendu went a step ahead to suggest that not only should the graduates play the I-League, but the academy should also have at least a 3-year contract with the players. That would give the players security.         
	Thapa also hinted that a change in the TFAs selection procedures might have been the reason behind the placid displays in last decade or so. Earlier, the scouts used to go to various places to select the players But now state associations send players for trials . That might have resulted a dip in the quality.         
	TFA, in fact, have gone back to Jamshedpur and if they qualify for the semis will return on Tuesday morning.

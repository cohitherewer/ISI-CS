            A STAFF REPORTER            Punjab Sports Club and Eastern Railway players in a scuffle on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: The Bengal Hockey Association (BHA)s first division group A league match between Eastern Railway Sports Association (ERSA) and Punjab Sports Club (PSC) on Thursday was marred by violence and crowd invasion following an altercation between players of both teams.         
	The match, played at the Mohun Bagan ground, ended 1-1. Ravinder Singh put PSC ahead in the 23rd minute. Mohammed Riyazuddin of ERSA equalised four minutes later.         
	But the high-voltage match took an ugly turn midway through the second half when ERSAs goalkeeper Pardeep Singh and PSCs goal-scorer Ravinder got into a scuffle after an on-field collision. Both players hit each other with their sticks.         
	Things virtually went out of hand when the supporters, who were sitting by the sidelines, entered the ground and attacked the players. The situation, however, was brought under control by the timely intervention of the mounted police, who helped disperse the crowd.         
	One wonders why the supporters were allowed inside the ground when they could have easily been accommodated in the galleries.         
	The incident held up the match for almost 15 minutes. Both players were later given marching orders.         
	BHA secretary Gurbux Singh, who was present at the ground, played down the matter saying such things happen in high-voltage matches. The players these days are such hot-tempered that such things usually happen in crunch matches. There were no major injuries and we could complete the match with the help of the police, he said.         
	Gurbux added that disciplinary action would be taken once the umpires submit their report. The league sub-committee will decide on the players future once the umpires file their report, he said.         
	Meanwhile, CESC will take on BNR in a potential championship decider at the Mohun Bagan ground on Friday.

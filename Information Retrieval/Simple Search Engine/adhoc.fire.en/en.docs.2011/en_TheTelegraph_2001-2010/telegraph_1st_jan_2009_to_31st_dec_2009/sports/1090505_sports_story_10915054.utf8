	Durban: Thoughts of revenge will fuel the Rajasthan Royals when Shane Warne and his boys take on the Yuvraj Singh-led Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League here Tuesday.         
	It took Kumar Sangakkaras first 50 of the tournament and Irfan Pathans all-round show to fashion Kings XIs 27-run win against the Royals in Cape Town.         
	Past records, however, would count for little when the sides square off at Kingsmead Tuesday.         
	Kings XI didnt have the best of starts in the tournament as they began with back-to-back defeats against the   
	Delhi DareDevils and the Kolkata Knight Riders in two rain-marred ties.  
	To their credit, Kings XI showed tremendous resilience and clinched three wins on the trot to bring their campaign back on track.         
	The momentum snapped when the Royal Challengers Bangalore upset their apple cart, but once again the Mohali outfit bounced back, beating the Kolkata Knight Riders Sunday and settling scores with the side which had beaten them in their first encounter.         
	In contrast, the defending champions, under Warne, have had a rollercoaster ride, with agony and ecstasy following each other.         
	The opening match debacle against the Royal Challengers was followed by the washed-out tie against the Mumbai Indians.         
	Beating the Knight Riders gave them their first taste of triumph and they went on to get the better of the mighty Delhi DareDevils and the redoubtable Deccan Chargers, losing to Kings XI and the Chennai Super Kings in between.         
	Even though Kings XI have won more matches  four compared to the Royals three  there is little to choose between the two.         
	The Mohali outfit have been well-served by their Sri Lankan recruits with Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene bailing out the side occasionally while Yuvrajs own form has been less than consistent.

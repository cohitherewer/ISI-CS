The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Selectors in a bind over Rahul Dravid
                                                   Selectors in a bind over Rahul Dravid
                      
	The senior national selectors have run into a Wall: Krishnamachari Srikkanth and his colleagues arent exactly sure how to handle the Rahul Dravid issue.         
	As of now, its assumed that Dravid will dominate discussions during Thursday mornings selection committee meeting, in Chennai, to pick 14 for the first three ODIs against Australia.         
	Dravid, 36, was recalled for the recent tri-series in Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy, but he didnt exactly make a huge impression.         
	Also, Dravids comeback (after almost two years) had much to do with Virender Sehwag not being available, as he was then in the rehab stage after surgery on his right shoulder.         
	Sehwags available now and theres a good chance that Yuvraj Singh, too, would be fit in time for the seven-match series start  October 25.         
	The Dravid issue is rather sensitive Its difficult for him to fit in, at the same time, somebody of his seniority cant be humiliated in any manner, a well-placed source told The Telegraph on Tuesday evening.         
	For a change, then, Srikkanth and Co. have much to lose sleep over.           LPS

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Md. Sp. aim to beat the drop
                                                   Md. Sp. aim to beat the drop
                            
	Panaji: Mohammedan Sporting face Dempo SC in a crucial I-League match at the Nehru Stadium in Margao on Thursday.         
	Mohammedan Sporting, fighting for survival, are on 22 points along with JCT, while United SC are one place above them on ninth with 23 points.         
	The Calcutta side needs to win the match to keep their hopes of beating the drop alive before they play table-topper Churchill Brothers in the final round.         
	We need to collect full points or at least a point to remain safe from relegation, said Mohammedan coach Shabbir Ali, who added that Mir Faroq Hyder would not be available on Thursday due to injury.         
	Defending champions Dempo, on the other hand, are at the fifth spot with 27 points.         
	Good performances in the ongoing AFC Cup have raised their confidence.           (PTI)

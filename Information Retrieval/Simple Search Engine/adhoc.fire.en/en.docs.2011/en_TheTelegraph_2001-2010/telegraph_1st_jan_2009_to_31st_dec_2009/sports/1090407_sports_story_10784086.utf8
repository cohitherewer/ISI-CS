The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hadlee bowls over Sachin
                                                   Hadlee bowls over Sachin
                      
	Wellington: Indian batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar, rated the greatest batsman ever by legendary all-rounder Richard Hadlee, said the accolade was a pleasant surprise for him as it came from a player of such unquestionable credentials.         
	Hadlee recently rated Tendulkar even higher than Don Bradman, considering the Indians staggering success in both the long and short formats of the game.         
	Tendulkar said it was a rare honour, especially coming from Hadlee, one of the greatest all-rounders to have played the game ever.         
	Nobody has ever said like that before. I am happy and satisfied, an elated Tendulkar said.         
	This comes as a pleasant surprise and it comes from a personality whose credentials cannot be questioned. I am happy that I played with him on my first tour to New Zealand in 1989, the Indian told a sport website.         
	Hadlee had pointed to Tendulkars mind-boggling achievements while rating him the greatest batsman ever.         
	Tendulkar recalled his first encounter with the star New Zealand player and said: I also cherish that memory. I still remember one moment after the Napier Test. He was giving an interview during which I found out he made his debut in 1973. I was born in the same year, which means when he made his debut in Tests, I was just born. Yet I got the opportunity to play against him. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Max Mosley mulls re-election 
                                                     Max Mosley mulls re-election 
                  Max Mosley                     
	London: Motor racing chief Max Mosley made clear on Tuesday that he would not be forced out of office by teams and car manufacturers threatening to set up their own Formula One championship.         
	In a combative letter to all member clubs, the International Automobile Federation (FIA) president indicated that he was thinking instead to seek re-election as head of the governing body.         
	Over recent weeks it has become increasingly clear that one of the objectives of the dissident teams is that I should resign, Mosley said.         
	However, in light of the attack on the mandate you have entrusted to me, I must now reflect on whether my original decision not to stand for re-election was indeed the right one, he said.         
	The FIAs 26-member world motor sport council, made up largely of national federations, is due to meet in Paris on Wednesday with Formula Ones threatened breakaway high on the agenda.         
	Mosley, who survived repeated calls for his resignation last year after a sado-masochistic sex scandal, had said after a confidence vote in May 2008 that he would step down this October.         
	It is for the FIA membership, and the FIA membership alone, to decide on its democratically elected leadership, not the motor industry and still less the individuals the industry employs to run its Formula One teams, he said on Tuesday.

    - Tthe Kolkata Knight Riders cricket manager gets candid             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            John Buchanan at a city hotel on Friday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh                                 
	Calcutta: John Buchanan, the much-in-the-news cricket manager of the Kolkata Knight Riders, spoke to The Telegraph for around 45 minutes on Friday evening.               
	The following are excerpts:         
	Q Youve been given additional security         
	A The police have added one officer I dont really know about the other (security-related) changes.         
	Were you worried when demonstrations were held and your effigy was burnt, on Thursday?         
	Not worried or anxious, but I havent experienced this previously. Im here as a guest of Calcutta and I hope people will realise that my aim is to make KKR the most successful franchise in the IPL.         
	Didnt the family (wife Judith and five children) get concerned?         
	I spoke to my wife and one of my sons this morning... Judith is a lot calmer now... Under control... Of course, my eldest son (Michael) is here with me.         
	Were you prepared for this kind of a response?         
	I suppose its the fallout of what happened during the (Greg) Chappell-Sourav (Ganguly) episode A little bit surprised, yes.         
	Disappointed that your move for multiple captains got turned into a John Buchanan versus Sourav Ganguly showdown?         
	Yes, in that it neednt have occupied peoples time, energy and so much space. Im sure there are a million things more important in this world than John Buchanan having more than one captain.         
	Looking back, do you regret stating at Sundays press conference that the Knight Riders leadership issue hadnt been decided? Would it have been better if youd spoken to Sourav before that?         
	Id sent him a text message Probably the reason why I didnt actually speak to him (before Sunday, on his latest trip) was because Id spoken to him about it earlier. Obviously, this sort of a thing can be talked about more, but Id been pretty clear about it in my mind I know what Im trying to achieve. Whether Sourav agrees or not is another matter You cant please everybody all the time.         
	That comment, though, couldve been avoided         
	I guess the answer is yes. But Id been pretty about it and didnt see an urgent need to address it further.         
	South Africas coach, Mickey Arthur, hasnt been bowled over         
	A couple of things Look, Im not doing it for the sake of grabbing headlines Im doing it for reasons that will benefit the game and Im not seeking anybodys approval or disagreement People need to sit back and review how cricket is actually going to live as a sport I say that because this T20 format can challenge the traditional game Having one captain to run the show in the traditional form is okay. In T20, though, I dont believe we need a single captain to be responsible for all the decisions.         
	Do you see yourself as a pioneer? Is this going to be your legacy?         
	(Grins) There are two types of pioneers The ones who get to the summit and come back Id like to be an Edmund Hillary, who reached the top of Everest and came back, not be like one of those who get to the summit and never come back! I believe its important to be exploring Its important to challenge the way things are done However, in this case, not at the expense of the franchise and the players To repeat what I first told you on Sunday, this is no slight on Sourav and certainly no indictment of him It just so happens that Sourav had been the captain in the IPLs inaugural edition I want to do something which is different, something which isnt tied to individuals At the moment, its a concept and hasnt landed, so to say In the next few weeks, weve got to ensure that this concept becomes a working reality.         
	What exactly do you mean by multiple captains? How many could there be on the field on any given day?         
	There will always be a nominated captain, who goes for the toss He could look after the bowling, make the changes Take care of the strategy aspect Be aware of the over-rates We could also have a fielding captain, who sets the field keeping in mind the planning done for that particular match The fielding captain complements the nominated/bowling captain One looks at the strategy, the other focuses on the detail required at that point in time Both will be supported by the coach (Matthew Mott), wholl be the captain off the field When the teams batting, the coach will be the captain You need one person Ive explained one scenario         
	So, a maximum of two on-field captains?         
	Probably, yes.         
	But which captain will be docked for falling behind on the over-rate?         
	(Laughs) Everybody The entire team The fine will have to be shared.         
	Will the coach too pay up?         
	Probably!         
	The multiple captains bit is part of your game plan to develop leaders. But is it necessary for each one of them to be a captain?         
	Probably not, but I want to encourage my players to be decision-makers At the moment, I dont think weve got enough decision-makers I was quite impressed with what Shane Warne did for the Rajasthan Royals in the IPLs inaugural edition He was the captain and coach and the way he went about things contributed to the Royals becoming the champions. He was player, captain and coach You had three roles residing in one individual.         
	Isnt there the likelihood of multiple captains leading to more confusion?         
	Theres no doubt there could be and that was discussed when I had a conversation with Sourav (on Tuesday) Thats something weve got to work on Get the concept going Obviously, well need to have very clear communication Very clear roles I realise that my players have grown up being used to one captain.         
	Frankly, how confident are you of the whole thing working?         
	If one gains the support of the senior group and if we go through the trial process well, then Ill be very confident.         
	When did the idea come to you?         
	Eight-nine years ago, after discussions with Ric Charlesworth Hes run the hockey team very differently Hed nominate a captain for the day, but all his players would be leaders. I found it fascinating The idea had been germinating since then.         
	But why didnt you try it during your years as the Australia coach?         
	I think I was the coach for just two-three T20 Internationals and T20 wasnt at all taken seriously then. As Ive said, my concept is for the T20 form of cricket, not Tests and ODIs.         
	Have you been inspired by any sport?         
	All the short duration ones Football, basketball, netball The ones where players respond according to the game plan Those games are run by people off the field or off the court Direct leadership, on the field, is needed in the longer games Tests and ODIs in cricket Thats where theres more freedom (for the players), thats where the boundaries expand         
	Are you suggesting there could be an exclusively programmed approach to T20 cricket?         
	There could be.         
	Is it tough to bring about change?         
	Everybody resists change Everybody is comfortable with a certain life (Adds after a pause) Organisations resist change My own belief is that change is vital for everybody and taking the easy way doesnt help.         
	Have you, in dealings with corporates, suggested something similar?         
	Not having multiple captains, but Ive suggested that there be a scoreboard to regularly judge individuals It could be done on a daily basis, but I dont know whether it can actually be done Half-yearly and yearly assessments come after a long period and how can everybody remember everything?         
	The final one: Are Sourav and you planning to have a one-on-one over dinner?         
	(Grins) If theres a problem then we probably should. I dont see one, though.

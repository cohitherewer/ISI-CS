	New Delhi: Two senior hockey officials met the International Hockey Federation (FIH) president, Leandro Negre on Tuesday requesting him to restrain Hockey India from adopting undemocratic practices in running the sport in the country.         
	The two officials  J.B. Roy, president, Bengal Hockey Association (BHA) and Amrit Bose, secretary, Indian Womens Hockey Federation (IWHF)  also asked the FIH chief to intervene in the matter.         
	Both Roy and Bose alleged that two Indian Olympic Association (IOA) officials, Lalit Bhanot and Harish Sharma were blatantly interfering with the democratic process in a bid to bring the state associations under Hockey India.         
	Both Roy and Bose said it was unfortunate that the IOA was indulging in dirty politicking.

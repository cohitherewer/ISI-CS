The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | One on song, other unsung
                                                   One on song, other unsung
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sunil Chetri is smiling these days and he has every reason to. The goal-drought is over for good and the India international is back on the scoresheet  his tally of seven goals is the highest by an Indian in the ongoing I-League. It feels great to be back among goals, he said at a news conference.         
	Chetri said they are not living in a fools paradise to be underestimating Mohammedan Sporting. They have players who have the quality and the character to trouble any team. Dont go by what the league table says.         
	While Chetri was talking to the media, M. Suresh was patiently waiting for him to finish. He wants a drop, the East Bengal skipper said. Suresh said he was not bitter about the fact that his performance against Mohun Bagan last Sunday has gone unnoticed.         
	Its a part of a defenders life. No pat after a good match, but brickbats for one blunder.         
	Suresh, whose career has been blighted by a series of injuries, said he owed a lot to his coach. I put on weight after suffering that injury during the first-leg match against Mohun Bagan. (Bhowmick) Sir helped me in regaining my fitness.         
	Not bitter about the barbs from the fans when he was sitting out with a muscle tear last season, Suresh said he wanted a little understanding from the club officials. They dont understand that after an injury you need time to recover.         
	But right now he is not thinking about those dark days. The team is winning. Nothing else matters. he said. But one fumble, the daggers will be drawn once again. Thats the life of a defender, isnt it?

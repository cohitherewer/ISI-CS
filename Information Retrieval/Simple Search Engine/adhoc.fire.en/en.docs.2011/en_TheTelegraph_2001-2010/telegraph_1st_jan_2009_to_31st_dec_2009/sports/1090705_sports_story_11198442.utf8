The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yelena reigns supreme
                                                   Yelena reigns supreme
                      
	Oslo: Olympic champion Yelena Isinbayeva won the womens pole vault at the Bislett Games on Friday, claiming her second Golden League win in as many appearances this season.         
	The Russian, below par at an event hit by bad weather, won by clearing 4.71 metres on her second attempt, beating Monica Pyrek into second place after the Pole cleared the height on her third attempt.         
	Svetlana Feofanova, another Russian, was third, clearing 4.66.         
	Isinbayeva began jumping at 4.71 when only the two opponents remained in contention. After she failed the first attempt, the meeting was interrupted by heavy rain.         
	The Russian returned to clear the height but then failed all her attempts at 4.81.         
	I am happy to win, but not with the result, said Isinbayeva, who is bidding for the $1 million Golden League jackpot for the winner of all six major meetings, having won the opening event in Berlin last month.         
	It was very difficult with all the waiting... It was one of the longest competitions Ive ever competed in during my life. First to wait before my first jump, and then waiting for the rain (to stop).         
	There are four more (Golden League meetings) left, then the world championships, Im happy Im still involved in this game, the bubbly Russian said with a smile.           (REUTERS)

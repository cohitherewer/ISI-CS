The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No.1 chokers to world No.1 
                                                     No.1 chokers to world No.1 
  - We now have a lot of depth in all positions, says SA coach Mickey Arthur       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Botha                                 
	Calcutta: The South Africans, clearly, have come a long way from being labelled chokers No.1 in limited overs cricket.         
	Bob Woolmer is no more, but he would surely have rejoiced at the regaining of the top position in the ICC rankings. No coach of South Africa, after all, suffered more heartbreaks in ODIs (most notably the 1999 World Cup) than Woolmer.         
	Mickey Arthur, of course, has enough reason to be on Cloud Nine. With a grand double under his belt, the summer in Australia couldnt have been any better either for him or his wards.         
	Everybody will want to beat us now and well have to prove that we are up for the challenge under all conditions. We still have room for improvement, but we now have a lot of depth in all positions, he said in Perth, at the end of a fantastic tour, on Friday evening.         
	Mickey, who like Gary Kirsten prefers staying away from the cameras and microphones, added: The other challenge is to meet both our own expectations and those of our supporters back home. Well start as favourites in the Castle Test and MTN one-day series against Australia and weve never been in such a position before         
	Former South Africa captain and one-time supremo of the Board there, Dr Ali Bacher, agreed in a chat with The Telegraph.         
	Absolutely Theres no doubt that well be the favourites What weve achieved over the past few weeks ranks as one of South Africas finest sporting achievements Im not trying to be smart, not trying to be wise after the event, but Id told an interviewer in Australia at the start of our tour that (Ricky) Pontings team wasnt invincible I got proved right.         
	Speaking from Johannesburg on Saturday afternoon, Dr Bacher added: The Australians, remember, have injury-related problems and thats not going to make things easier for them         
	The three-Test series begins at the Wanderers (JoBurg) on February 26. The five ODIs will follow.         
	Owing to an injury, regular captain Graeme Smith played no role in South Africas awesome 4-1 win in the just-ended ODIs.         
	His non-availability put Johan Botha on the centre stage and the off-spinner earned kudos as stand-in captain.         
	Well, Bothas is a truly remarkable story From nowhere, he has become an international figure and a part of our cricketing history He showed the qualities of a leader Botha had captained the South Africa Schools some nine years ago, though, Dr Bacher commented.         
	The 26-year-old has, however, been controversial.         
	Specifically, not long ago, Bothas action was suspect and the ICC had then banned him from bowling. He has modified it, yes, but isnt a regular in Test cricket (left-arm spinner Paul Harris is).         
	Ashwell Prince is the vice-captain in Tests.         
	Incidentally, Botha made his debut in Hyderabad, in November 2005, during the ODI series where the talking point was Sourav Gangulys omission and the martial law of sorts imposed by Greg Chappell in the Team India dressing room.         
	Botha would actually bowl medium-pace till Mickey, then his provincial coach, advised (in the early part of this decade) that he take to spin. His argument: South Africa had enough new-ball bowlers, but hardly any spinner of note.         
	Mickeys advice was quickly taken.

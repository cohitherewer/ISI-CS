  - 3 batsmen hit centuries as Karnataka post a huge score; Unbeaten 102 by Agarkar             Sourasish Lahiri                           
	Mysore: Bengal conceded first innings lead once again as hosts Karnataka batsmen made a mockery of the visitors bowling piling up 523 for nine in a Super League (Group B) match of the Ranji Trophy, being played at the Gangotri Glades in Mysore on Thursday.         
	At stumps on the third day, a healthy first-innings lead of 199 ensured at least three points for the hosts. After being hammered for the better part of the last two days, the task is now cut out for the Bengal batsmen to save their team from an outright loss and log home a point.         
	It was run feast on the third day as opener K.B. Pawan (134), No 4 batsman Amit Verma (157) and wicketkeeper C Muralidhar Gautam (108 batting) scored centuries. Robin Uthappas boys added a further 336 runs to their overnight score of 187 for two.         
	Opener Pawan and Verma added 249 runs for the third-wicket and laid the foundation for a huge total. Pawan batted for six hours and 43 minutes and faced 289 deliveries. In the process of reaching his third first-class century, Pawan hit 14 boundaries and a six. Left-hander Verma, whose previous best was 35, went onto hit his maiden century. His faced 267 deliveries.         
	Bengal got the breakthrough when Ranadeb Bose got rid of Pawan caught behind.         
	Manish Pandey (5) was the next man out when Wriddhiman Saha caught him off Sourashis Lahiri. Vermas 398-minute battle ended when Bose got his third wicket once again caught by Saha.         
	At 356, B. AKhil (13) was the sixth Karnataka wicket to fall caught by Deep Dasgupta off Lahiris bowling. However, glovesman Gautam partnered veteran Sunil Joshi and the next wicket fell after the duo had added 116 runs for the seventh wicket.         
	Gautam scored his runs off only 152 deliveries with 14 hits to the fence. This is his second first-class century. Joshi played an useful knock of 42 with the help of three fours and two sixes.         
	There was not much to write home about the Bengal bowling. Although Bose (3/97) and Lahiri (5/160) shared eight of the nine wickets between themselves, they couldnt make the decisive inroads when it mattered most.

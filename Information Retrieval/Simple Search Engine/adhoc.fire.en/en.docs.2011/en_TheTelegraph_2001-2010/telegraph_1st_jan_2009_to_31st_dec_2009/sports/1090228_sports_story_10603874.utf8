                                                     England post huge total
                  Collingwood                     
	Bridgetown: Paul Collingwood hit an undefeated half-century on Friday as England continued to pile on the runs on Day II of the fourth Test against the West Indies at Kensington Oval.         
	The visitors, resuming on 301 for 3, went to lunch on 405 for 4 with Collingwood on 52 and Ravi Bopara on 46 at the crease.               
	At midnight, England were 532 for five. Tim Ambrose and Ravi Bopara were at the crease. Collingwood was out for 96.         
	Collingwood struck six fours off 104 balls, passing 3,000 Test runs when he reached 19. Fidel Edwards (1/114) produced a fiery spell of nine overs that produced the only wicket of the morning but the fast bowler was unlucky not to claim more.         
	The West Indies began brightly when, 20 minutes into the day, Edwards removed Kevin Pietersen for 41 at 318 for 4. Pietersen, on 32 overnight, was clearly leg before wicket as he played across the line. The batsman challenged Russell Tiffins verdict but third umpire Daryl Harper confirmed the correct decision was made.         
	Edwards should have made further inroads in the next over but Boparas ill-controlled hook shot was spilled by Jerome Taylor running in from deep square leg.         
	That chance was the third off Edwards bowling following two misses on day one. He continued to pepper Bopara with short balls and the Essex man engaged in an absorbing battle.         
	He top-edged one just off the finger-tips of leaping substitute Sharmarh Brooks on the boundarys edge for six and then was hit in the grille of the helmet as he missed another hook.

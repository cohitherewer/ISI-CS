                                                   Australia wrest initiative
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Centurion: World champions Australia were struggling at 47 for two after 18 overs in the Champions Trophy final against New Zealand on Monday.                     
	Australia were 134 for three after 35 overs. Shane Watson (66) and Michael Hussey (0) were at the crease. Cameron White was bowled by Kyle Mills for 62 after a 128-run partnership for the second wicket                     
	Chasing 201 for victory, Australia lost Tim Paine and captain Ricky Ponting in the first three overs as the Shane Bond-led attack sent shivers down their spine. While Bond removed Paine in the second over, Kyle Mills trapped Ponting leg before.         
	Shane Watson (26) and Cameron White (16) were at the crease in a desperate bid to repair the damage. White had a narrow escape when Brendon McCullum, who was having a nightmarish match, dropped an easy chance in the 18th over.         
	The start of the Australian innings was delayed after flying ants circled the ground after the break.         
	Earlier, New Zealand, looking rudderless without their injured captain Daniel Vettori, limped to 200 for nine in their 50 overs.         
	The Black Caps were stifled by some aggressive bowling and fielding by the Australians on a lively pitch at the SuperSport Park. Vettoris last-minute pull-out with a hamstring injury was just the start of New Zealands woes and they never recovered after opting to bat first.         
	Stand-in captain McCullum fell for a 14-ball duck in the fourth over of the match. Peter Siddle had banged it in short and as McCullum flashed outside the off stump, the nick was gobbled up by Tim Paine.         
	New Zealand never got going and barring two decent partnerships it was a tale of misses. Aaron Redmond (26) and Martin Guptill (40) put together 61 runs for the second wicket, while Neil Broom (37) and James Franklin (33) added 65 for the sixth, underlining their struggle in the middle.         
	Pontings men were clinical in their approach. They looked determined to retain the trophy for the second time running and it showed in their body language.         
	Under Pontings inspirational leadership  he was aggressive in his field placements and change of bowlers  all three pacers were fast, disciplined and menacing. Nathan Hauritz was canny, providing the vital breakthroughs and was the most successful, returning figures of three for 37.         
	The first time the New Zealand run-rate crossed four an over was at the end of the 43rd over, but they had lost seven wickets by then and consumed the batting Powerplay.         
	If losing Jacob Oram, Daryl Tuffey and Jesse Ryder at different stages of the tournament was not bad enough, New Zealand were dealt a big blow when Vettori was replaced by Jeetan Patel.         
	By the time the match was into its 27th over, the New Zealand top order was cooling their heels in the hut.         
	After McCullums early departure, it wasnt easy for Guptill and Redmond. The bowlers didnt give space and runs were hard to come by.         
	Guptill hit Mitchell Johnson for two fours in the same over in a rare moment of aggression but it took him and Redmond 15.1 overs to raise those 61 runs. Hauritz then foxed a distinctly uncomfortable Redmond to break the partnership. Seeing the opener coming down the wicket, the off-spinner hurled it wide. He couldnt reach the ball and Paine clipped off the bails in a flash.         
	A little later, Guptill made a complete mess of another Hauritz delivery, offering a tame return catch to leave his team tottering at 77 for three. But the crisis was not over yet.         
	Michael Hussey took a blinder off Johnson to remove Ross Taylor (6) in the next over and then Brett Lee trapped in-form Grant Elliott (9) to polish the top half, pushing them into a hole.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arthur criticises Buchanan plan
                                                     Arthur criticises Buchanan plan
                  Arthur                     
	Durban: South Africa coach Mickey Arthur was not at all amused with John Buchanans idea of having more than one captain for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the ensuing second edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) and felt such a move would only end up confusing team members.         
	It has to be one leader always, Arthur said.         
	I favour the one-captain situation because everybody in the team is clear about who is in charge at all times, said the Proteas coach who felt if a team had multiple captains it could leave players confused and disoriented, especially during a match.         
	If you have more than one guy as leader, you dont know whom to turn to, he told to a cricket website.         
	Arthur, however, said communication between the coach and players is mandatory for this experiment to succeed. The 40-year-old also expressed his desire to speak to Buchanan to know about the concept.         
	I really dont know what he is aiming at. But I know from experience that communication within a team is fundamental to its success, and that could be a problem when you actually implement this idea on the ground. The players need to know clearly who is in charge, Arthur said.         
	Meanwhile, former South Africa coach Ray Jennings, who was replaced by Arthur, thought Buchanans idea to be interesting and might just work.         
	He is a very experienced coach and he obviously has his own game plans, said Jennings, who is the coach of Royal Challengers Bangalore.         
	I respect him for that. It is an interesting idea and it is an idea that can work.         
	Arthur has been in charge of the South African side since May 2005. A successful first-class cricketer himself, Arthur took over from the fairly successful Jennings.         
	Arthurs stint has been quite a successful as the South Africans have become one of the top three sides in the world in Tests and one-dayers. They have recently beaten Australia in Australia in both forms of the game.         
	However, they lost the home series 1-2, losing the chance to dethrone the Australians as the No.1 Test team.         
	One of the reasons for South Africas success has been the presence of a strong captain in Graeme Smith.

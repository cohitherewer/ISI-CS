                                                     Netherlands stun England
                  Ravi Bopara en route to his 46 on Friday                     
	London: Luke Wright hit a blazing 71 and shared a 102-run opening partnership with Ravi Bopara (46) to help England post a decent 162 for five against The Netherlands in the opening match of the ICC Twenty20 World Championships here Friday.               
	The Netherlands beat England by four wickets in their Group B match on Friday. The visitors reached the target off the last ball of the innings.               
	Put in to bat, England openers laid a strong foundation for a big score but hosts lost quick wickets to lose plot in the end.         
	Once Bopara was dismissed in the 12th over, England struggled to forge partnerships as batsmen got out in hurry. While the hosts raised first 100 runs in 11 overs, they could manage just 62 runs in the subsequent overs.         
	Ryan ten Doeschate, who dismissed both Bopara and Wright, was the most successful bowler for the Netherlands, giving away 35 runs in his four overs.         
	Bopara provided an apt start to the second edition of the T20 World Cup by hitting the first ball of the slam-bang event for a boundary off Dirk Nannes.         
	Luke Wright in company of Bopara gave England a decent if not spectacular start, hitting boundaries with ease and rotating the strike to keep the scoreboard ticking.         
	The duo raised 50 runs within first six overs even though runs were not easy to come by under the conditions.         
	As the innings progressed, the stroke-making became easier and two batsmen got involved in a sort of battle to outscore each other.         
	Dutch bowlers bore the brunt of this competition between the English batsmen, as scoreboard was reading 89 without loss at half-way mark.         
	Left-arm spinner Pieter Seelaar was only the bowler who left some impact on them with his intriguing spell in the first-half of the innings.         
	It was Doetschate who stemmed the rot by sending back Bopara, who went for maximum, miscued the shot and ended up in the hands of Seelaar. Owais Shah (5) joined Wright in the middle but only to return early. Wright completed his half-century but the twin-blow put some brakes on the scoring rate.         
	The stage was set for a massive score for the hosts but suddenly Dutch side began dominating as Eoin Morgan (6) and skipper Paul Collingwood (11) too started their walk back to dug out.

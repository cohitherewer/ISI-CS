                                                   South Zone stretch lead to 567
                      
	Rajkot: Robin Uthappa smashed a blistering century to take South Zone on the verge of Duleep Trophy final on the penultimate day of their four-day semi-final match North Zone at Madhavrao Scindia Ground here Saturday.         
	Uthappas century helped his side end the third day on 319 for three from 63 overs which swelled the overall lead to 567.         
	Earlier, in reply to Souths 548, North had folded up their first innings on 300 in 71.2 overs, giving their opponents a 248-run first-innings lead.         
	Resuming at 172 for three, North Zone overnight batsmen Sunny Sohal and Uday Kaul raised some hopes by adding 85 runs for the fourth wicket before getting separated. Kaul made 40 with seven fours off 63 balls.         
	Sohal completed his half-century off 57 balls with five fours and two sixes but was unlucky not to complete his well-deserved hundred. He made 94 facing 99 balls and hit 12 fours and three sixes.

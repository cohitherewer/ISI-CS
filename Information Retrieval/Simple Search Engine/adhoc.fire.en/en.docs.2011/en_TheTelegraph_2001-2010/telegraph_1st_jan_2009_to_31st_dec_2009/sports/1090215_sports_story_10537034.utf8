  - Hosts take on Jharkhand in East Zone National One-dayer today
            A STAFF REPORTER            Laxmi Ratan Shukla with Utpal Chatterjee at the Eden on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: This was supposed to be a clash between Sourav Ganguly and Mahendra Singh Dhoni. But the Team India captains decision to make himself unavailable for the National one-dayers has come as a damper.         
	Nevertheless, Bengal are quietly confident on the eve of their opener against Jharkhand at the Eden on Sunday. There is a conscious attempt not to undermine their opponents and qualify as the No.1 team from the zone for the Vijay Hazare Trophy.         
	Were not going to take any team lightly This being our first match we are extra cautious. We may be the better team on paper, but it hardly means anything At the end of the day, performance counts, Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla said.         
	Sourav skipped practice on Saturday but will play the match. He has been practising hard for the past few days and nothing should be read into his absence today He is available for Bengal, assured Shukla.         
	Sourav, who has called it quits from first-class cricket, will use these matches  he will not play against Tripura  to get into the right groove before the start of the Indian Premier League.         
	Bengal, who made the Ranji quarter finals after qualifying for the Elite group this season, can only gain from his presence.         
	Dadas presence will obviously give us the edge. We hope to cash in on that, Shukla said.         
	Sourav, it is learnt, will bat at No. 3. As he has not played a match for sometime, he has requested that he be allowed to bat at No. 3 and not open the innings, said a member of the team management.         
	Bengal are looking to bat first on a wicket that has a fair sprinkling of grass. A score of around 270 will suffice, felt Shukla.         
	Bengal coach Utpal Chatterjee was of the opinion that the wicket was full of runs. Batting first will be wise because the wicket will tend to slow down in the second session. Weve played a practice match on this wicket It seems to be full of runs, felt the former Bengal left-arm spinner.         
	The Bengal players went through their paces under the watchful eyes of consultant Mohinder Amarnath and Utpal for close to three hours.         
	Jharkhand are a young and promising bunch. Were aware of their strengths, said Shukla.         
	The visitors are hoping to play to their potential.         
	Bengal are a formidable side. It would have been nice if Dhoni was around. We have got used to playing without him and will play to our strengths, Jharkhand captain Shiv Shankar Rao said.         
	The new set of rules for the tournament will allow no compulsory ball change during the entire 50 overs of an innings. This means the batting side cannot take the advantage of a hard ball towards the end of the innings.         
	That is the rule Cant do anything about it. But dont think that will be a big problem. We have had enough practice with the white ball, said Shukla.         
	The Jharkhand captain echoed the same opinion. Dont think ball change will make much of a difference, said Rao.

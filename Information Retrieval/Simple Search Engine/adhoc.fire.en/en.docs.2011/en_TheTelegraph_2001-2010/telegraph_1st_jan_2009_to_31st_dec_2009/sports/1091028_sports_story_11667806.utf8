	Calcutta: Belgian Phillippe de Ridder and Serbian Zoran Dordevic have been shortlisted by East Bengal to fill into Subhas Bhowmicks boots as the club began their endeavour to steady the ship after faltering in the initial part of the season so far.         
	Though the club said Tuesday that they would zero in on one within the next 48 hours, sources reveal that De Ridder is all set to take charge of the red and gold brigade.         
	De Ridders appointment looks all the more certain as Zoran, when contacted said: Im unaware about any such development as there havent been any intimation from the club till now.         
	East Bengal president Pronab Dasgupta, after a core committee meeting at the club Tuesday, informed: We had biodatas of six or seven coaches and we decided on these two. The football secretary, Santosh Bhattacharya, will talk with both of them and we will declare the coach within the next two days.         
	The club has also decided to appoint Atanu Bhattacharya as the goalkeeping coach  a move triggered after a horrendous show under the bar by Abhra Mondal in the Sunday derby against Mohun Bagan. Arpan Dey, who is also the coach of the clubs under-19 team, was looking after the job.         
	De Ridders familiarity with the club, having been at the helm of affairs during the 2005-06 season, may also see him get the tick ahead of the Serbian.         
	There are a few issues to be sorted out before appointing the coach. There availability and the financial deals would surely be at the top of the list. We havent talked with the players about the coach But we will take their inputs later, added Dasgupta.         
	The contract with the coach will be for the 2009-10 season only. Dasgupta also informed that assistant coach Tushar Rakshit would continue in his post.         
	Rakshit along with the goalkeeping coach and senior players will be in charge of the team for the clubs next I-League match against Salgaocar on Thursday. But according to sources, they may be in charge of East Bengal for their matches against Viva Kerala, Air India and Lajong FC as well if the appointment of the coach gets delayed.         
	Meanwhile, the club is all set to call two goalkeepers for trials one of whom is a Player of Indian origin. The other is from Punjab.

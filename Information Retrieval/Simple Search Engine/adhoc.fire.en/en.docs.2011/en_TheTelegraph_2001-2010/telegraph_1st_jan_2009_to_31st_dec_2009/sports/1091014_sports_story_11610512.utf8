The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis quits, PCB pleads
                                                   Younis quits, PCB pleads
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan cricket plunged into fresh crisis Tuesday with Younis Khan stepping down as captain of the national team in dramatic circumstances, and refusing to take back his resignation despite persuasion by the chairman of the cricket board.         
	The high drama took place during the hearing of the National Assembly standing committee on sports in Islamabad, which was being held to discuss the performance of the national team in the recent Champions Trophy.         
	Younis submitted his resignation during the hearing to PCB chairman Ejaz Butt, protesting the statement made by the chairman of the standing committee, Jamshed Dasti, who had alleged that the team had deliberately under-performed against Australia and New Zealand in the Champions Trophy.         
	More drama followed as Butt returned the resignation to Younis and Dasti told the angry cricketer that his statement had been misunderstood, and he never made any match-fixing allegations against Younis or his teammates. But when the hearing ended and Butt came out of the hearing and sat in the car, 31-year-old Younis came running and again handed over his resignation.         
	Younis told the chairman he didnt want to be the captain and left in his car, an eyewitness said.         
	Yes, Ive submitted my resignation because Im disgusted by these match-fixing allegations made against me and the team, Younis said. I have told the chairman to go through my resignation and read my point of view.         
	Sources close to him also said his letter indicated he wanted to take a break from cricket and would not be available for the upcoming series against New Zealand and Australia.         
	Butt later told reporters that he had full confidence in the leadership abilities of Younis, and had told him to take back his resignation. But obviously if this matter is not resolved, then it would be discussed at the meeting of the governing council on October 19, Butt said.         
	Younis, who had led Pakistan to the World Twenty20 triumph earlier this year, was hurt by the match-fixing allegations levelled at him and his teammates, after they crashed out in the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy.         
	A provincial sports minister, also a PCB governing council member, alleged an Indian hand behind Pakistans semi-final defeat, while others felt Pakistan had tanked their matches against Australia and New Zealand.         
	Younis played the semi-final with a fractured finger and dropped a crucial catch that proved costly and it only added fuel to the fire at home.           (AGENCIES)

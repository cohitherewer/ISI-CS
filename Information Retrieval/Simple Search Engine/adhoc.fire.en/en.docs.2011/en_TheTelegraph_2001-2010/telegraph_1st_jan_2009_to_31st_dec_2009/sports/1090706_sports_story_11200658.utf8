	Galle: Mohammed Yousuf celebrated his return to Test cricket with a century that helped Pakistan to a 50-run first innings lead against Sri Lanka on the second day of the first match on Sunday.         
	Pakistan began day two on a precarious 15 for two but sensible batting by the middle order led by Yousuf took them to 342 all out.         
	Lanka had to negotiate just one over before stumps and were yet to score, but did not lose a wicket.         
	Pakistan nightwatchman Abdur Rauf and captain Younis Khan had earlier averted the possibility of a batting collapse with a 50-run partnership. Yousuf and Misbah-ul Haq then built on that platform with a 139-run fifth-wicket stand.         
	Yousuf also put on 75 runs for the sixth wicket with Shoaib Malik (38), after Misbah was caught by Mahela Jayawardene at slip off left-arm spinner Rangana Herath on 56 runs.         
	He faced 128 balls and hit nine boundaries.         
	Yousuf was eventually run out to a direct throw by wicketkeeper Tillekaratne Dilshan at the non-strikers end for 112, his 29th hundred in his 80th Test. He spent four and a half-hours at the crease, faced 186 balls and hit 10 boundaries.         
	Seamer Nuwan Kulasekera was the pick of the bowlers with four for 71 while left-arm seamer Thilan Thushara took two for 77.         
	Yousuf had been exiled from Test cricket for 19 months after he signed up with the rebel Indian Cricket League. But the authorities recalled him for the Lanka tour after he broke ties with the unsanctioned league.         
	On the first day, Pakistans new-look bowling attack  which included three debutants  restricted Lanka to 292 but its batsmen made a nervous start losing opener Sulman Butt to seamer Nuwan Kulasekera on the second ball of the innings.

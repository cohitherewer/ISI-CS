                                                     Introspection and a sense of regret
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            File picture of Buchanan, Shah Rukh and Sourav                           
	Calcutta: Its time for some political parties and politicians to regret either having broken away from a coalition or spurning a suitor in the build-up to the general elections.         
	Also time, it appears, for a degree of introspection in the beleaguered Kolkata Knight Riders, an IPL franchise very high on brand value but terribly low on performance.         
	Indeed, according to a well-placed source of The Telegraph, belatedly, theres actually a sense of regret that the captaincy issue wasnt handled better in the lead-up to the ongoing edition No.2.         
	Sourav Ganguly, it may be recalled, was sacked just a couple of days before the Knights first match. His seat went to Brendon McCullum, hand-picked by John Buchanan, the head of cricket operations.         
	I think were learning from the manner Sourav was removed... The franchise earned nothing but negative headlines and the players came under pressure... It ought to have been managed better...         
	From what I know, (principal owner) Shah Rukh Khan has been advised from within not to take the same path in removing Buchanan...         
	Weve got to handle things in a manner where theres no sense of regret either over the timing of any move or the move itself, a well-placed source said on Saturday, hours before an inconsequential 12th match.         
	Whatever his public posture, having invested millions (and plenty by way of emotion), Shah Rukh is furious with the Knights performance, which has assured them of a rock bottom-finish, and seems ready for the most drastic of actions.         
	Last year, in the inaugural edition, the Knights had finished sixth (third last).         
	Its possible that McCullum will be persuaded not to quit, something hed talked of doing if the Knights didnt make the semi-finals, but it appears highly unlikely that Buchanan is going to continue.         
	Confirmation couldnt be got, but it seems Buchanan has a three-year contract, which runs till 2010. However, theres bound to be a severance/exit clause.

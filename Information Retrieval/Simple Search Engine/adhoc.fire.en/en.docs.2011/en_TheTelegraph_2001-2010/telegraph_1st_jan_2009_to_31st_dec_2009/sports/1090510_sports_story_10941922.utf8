The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Unhappy Sohail Tanvir hopes dialogue will sort things out
                                                     Unhappy Sohail Tanvir hopes dialogue will sort things out
  - We shouldve been allowed to play once the IPL was shifted to SA       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sohail Tanvir                                 
	Dubai: Sohail Tanvir, the most successful bowler in the IPLs inaugural edition, last year, is very disappointed that circumstances beyond his control have made him miss season No.2.         
	The left-arm speedster had been a key player in the Rajasthan Royals totally unexpected success.         
	Im very disappointed... I believe we shouldve been allowed to play once the IPL was shifted to South Africa, Tanvir told The Telegraph on Friday evening.         
	Speaking at the opulent Grand Hyatt, shortly before the Pakistan team left for Abu Dhabi on the way home after six matches against Australia in the UAE, he added: Im confident I wouldve matched, if not bettered, last years record (22 wickets in 11 outings)... Lekin chance hi nahin diya gaya...         
	Tanvir confirmed that he and a couple of other players  former captain Shoaib Malik and Salman Butt, in all probability  would leave for South Africa early next week for a dialogue with IPL supremo Lalit Modi.         
	A number of issues need to be discussed and well be accompanied by a representative of the company weve engaged to handle our case... I strongly feel the IPL shouldve reviewed our status, especially after our government issued the NOCs once the tournament moved out of India, he said.         
	Of course, before the IPL got shifted, Islamabad had barred Pakistani players from travelling to India. It was a 26/11 fallout.         
	Asked whether compensation from the franchises would be high on their agenda, Tanvir replied: That will be talked about, yes... Lets see how the dialogue with the IPL goes...         
	The engagements (five ODIs and one T20 match) against Australia coincided with the first half of the IPL and, so, the speedster wasnt able to establish contact either with Royals captain Shane Warne or anybody else in the franchise.         
	Now, I suppose there will be time to interact... If were in a city where the Royals are playing, then Ill be able to meet Warne and the others in person... Im delighted that the team has begun to do well after starting somewhat indifferently... Khushi ho rahi hai, Tanvir remarked.         
	Missing out on the IPLs second edition has meant fewer T20 matches before next months World T20 in England and thats cause for more disappointment.         
	You can only gain by playing with and against the best in the world... However, our Board has worked out a schedule, whereby well get to play some T20 matches at home, before we leave for England, the 24-year-old pointed out.

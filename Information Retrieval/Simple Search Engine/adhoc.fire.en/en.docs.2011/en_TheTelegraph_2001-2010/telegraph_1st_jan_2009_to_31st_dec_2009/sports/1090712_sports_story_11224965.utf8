The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Amritraj ousted
                                                   Amritraj ousted
                      
	New Port: Last-year runner-up Prakash Amritraj made a disappointing exit from the Hall of Fame Championships after losing to third-seeded American Sam Querrey in the second round on Friday.         
	Amritraj lost to Querrey, who entered the quarter finals of the rain-marred tournament.         
	The Indian was hoping to emulate his father Vijay Amritraj, who won three championship here in 1976, 1980, 1984, and tried hard by clinching the first set on tie break (9-7) against the big serving American.         
	But Amritrajs joy was short-lived as Querrey broke his opening serve in the second set, and didnt concede a single breakpoint en route to levelling the match at a set apiece.         
	Querrey broke Amritraj twice in the final set to book a quarter final berth. (PTI)

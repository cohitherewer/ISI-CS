The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | West Indies outbatted us: Ponting
                                                   West Indies outbatted us: Ponting
                      
	London: Australia captain Ricky Ponting said it was just brilliant batting by the West Indies which knocked them out of Saturdays contest on Saturday.         
	After losing the match by seven wickets at the The Oval despite scoring a competitive 169, Ponting said: I didnt think it was a bad total to be honest, but when Chris and Adrian came out batting as they did there, it was going to be hard for us.         
	They just went with the flow. They threw caution to the wind; they outplayed us, Ponting added.         
	His counterpart Gayle refused to over the moon with this performance. While this victory meant the West Indies remained unbeaten against the Aussies in the shortest form of the game, Gayle said it was important to forget this game quickly and focus on the next game. The West Indies captain also said the teams fielding needed to improve.         
	We werent best in the outfield, but 170 was gettable. I am disappointed on how I got out...We just have to rally again, put this game behind and try to win against Sri Lanka. Its not over yet, he said.         
	Gayle praised his opening partner Andre Fletcher.         
	I have to give credit to Fletcher. He played really well. I looked to bat till the 15th over and thought if I do, the game would be settled by then, he remarked. (agencies)

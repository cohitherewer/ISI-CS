                                                   Freddie out of T20 Cup
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff was ruled out of the World T20 Cup, which starts on June 5, on Wednesday because he has not fully recovered from knee surgery.         
	The England and Wales Cricket Board had expected Flintoff to get over last months operation on a meniscus tear to his right knee but has now called up Adil Rashid to replace him.         
	The 31-year-old Flintoff had the surgery after he pulled out of the IPL, where he was the most costly player in the pre-tournament auction along with England teammate Kevin Pietersen.         
	The injury had ruled him out of Englands recently concluded Test and one-day International series against the West Indies.         
	The 21-year-old Rashid, who plays county cricket for Yorkshire, bowls leg-spin and bats in the middle-order.

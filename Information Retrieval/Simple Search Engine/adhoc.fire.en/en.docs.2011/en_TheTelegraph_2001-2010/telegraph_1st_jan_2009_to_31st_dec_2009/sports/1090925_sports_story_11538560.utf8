            SRIMAX                        
	Robert Foley-trained Wonder Smile had an easy measure of Talk Of The Devil in the 1,800m Chief Ministers Gold Cup, the main event at the Mysore races on Thursday. B. Prakash partnered the hot favourite to a seven-length victory. The afternoon was otherwise ruled by less fancied winners. As a result of this, all pools on the day remained unsolved.RESULTS

	Calcutta: It had been an anxious wait for Niraj Khemka but finally his luck changed Sunday when he defeated Manish Jain 4-2 for the senior snooker title in the State Billiards and Snooker Championships at the Bengal Rowing Club.         
	Champion two years back, Khemka breathed a sigh of relief when his second state title finally came within grasp.         
	It had been an anxious wait, said the winner. After that triumph two years back, somehow, another title had been eluding me. Im just overjoyed as today (Sunday) has been a dream come true.         
	Credit must be given to Khemka for emerging victorious after losing the first two frames on the last black ball.         
	In the process of seeing off Jains challenge by winning four consecutive frames with his steady and calculated game, Khemka also made a break of 62 in the fifth frame.         
	However, the distinction of the highest break in the Championship goes to Billiards champion Akram Khan for making 63 in an earlier round.         
	This was Jains third consecutive year as finalist in this tournament.         
	Khemka and Jain have both qualified to represent West Bengal in the forthcoming National Billiards and Snooker Championships in Agra. I practice eight hours a day at the Sports Authority of India and that is how I shall prepare for the Nationals, said Khemka who has been associated with snooker for the past 18 years.         
	Akram Khan and Aamer Hussain will represent Bengal in billiards at the Nationals.         
	The Winners         
	Akram Khan (senior billiards), Suniti Damani (ladies billiards), Dipayan Kothari (junior billiards), Anish Poddar (sub-junior billiards), Niraj Khemka (senior snooker), Shreya Kothari (ladies snooker), Shoaib Khan (junior snooker) and Harshvardhan Goenka (sub-junior snooker)

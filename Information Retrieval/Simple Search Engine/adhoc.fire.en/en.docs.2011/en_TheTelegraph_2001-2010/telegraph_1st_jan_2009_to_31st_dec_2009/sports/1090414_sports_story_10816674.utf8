                                                     Cabrera grabs green jacket 
            Larry Dorman            Last years winner Trevor Immelman (left) presents Angel Cabrera with the green jacket in Augusta on Sunday.                           
	Augusta: When it comes to sudden changes, head-spinning and gut-wrenching ones, there is once again no place like Augusta National on a Sunday. The first three-man sudden-death playoff in 22 years at the Masters followed a daylong rush of adrenaline-charged roars that cascaded like Niagara Falls across the greensward.         
	And when it was done, when the apparent victors were vanquished and the astounding winner raised his arms in the dying light, the story was etched on the faces of each. The winner, ngel Cabrera, a former caddie from Argentina, wore an expression of pure joy. The vanquished, Kenny Perry, a 48-year-old whose life is filled with everything but a major championship, wore a look of grim acceptance. And Chad Campbell, whose Masters began with five straight birdies and ended with a 5-foot miss, simply looked perplexed.         
	Cabrera had outlasted the two golfers who had the best chances to win only to fail at crucial moments. He had banged his own golf ball around in the trees right of the 18th hole in the first playoff hole and made par, but Campbell bogeyed the first playoff hole from the middle of the fairway. Then Cabrera finished off Perry, who had butchered two finishing holes and the second hole of sudden death.         
	Cabreras final-round 71 for a 12-under-par total of 276 included birdies on three of his final six holes and a clutch par save on the final hole of regulation, where he got up and down from in front of the 18th green with a 20-yard pitch and a 5-foot putt. Campbells round of 69 included birdies at the 12th, 13th and 15th holes and a near birdie at the 18th that would have won it.         
	But with a two-stroke lead going to the 17th tee, it was Perrys tournament to lose. He had not had a bogey in 22 holes, and had not faded when Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods were waging their stress-inducing, ear-splitting duel earlier in the day  pulling to within a stroke of Perrys lead when they were at No. 16.         
	But standing up to Mickelsons 67, good for fifth place, and Woodss 68, tied for sixth, proved easier than finishing off two holes with a two-stroke lead.         
	Perry bogeyed Nos.17 and 18, hitting a 7-iron over the green from 176 yards at 17 and then skulling a chip across the green. At 18, he hit a drive into the left bunker, a 7-iron that hooked left of the green, and a missed 15-footer for par.         
	Cabrera has won two major championships, both with cool performances under pressure. Although Perry seemed to have the tournament won, Cabrera hung in with clutch putts, matching Perrys birdies at 15 and 16 to stay within two strokes of the lead.         
	When Perry made his second bogey in a row at 18, Cabrera pounced, knocking a 5-footer for par, then prevailing in the playoff. It was not easy. He escaped elimination on the first playoff hole, the 18th, after pin-balling his golf ball in the woods, first on his drive and then when his attempted escape ricocheted off a pine tree into the fairway.         
	From about 70 yards short of the green, Cabrera got up and down, pitching his ball 6 feet from the hole and making the putt to continue the playoff. Campbell was eliminated by failing to get up and down from the right bunker.         
	When the playoff moved to the 10th hole, Cabrera hit the fairway and the green. Perry hit the fairway and hooked a 6-iron left of the green. He hit his pitch shot too hard again, and failed to make his 15-footer for par.         
	Cabrera had two putts from 22 feet for the green jacket. He knocked his first within two feet and tapped in for the win.         
	This moment and also Oakmont in 2007 are the happiest moments of my life, said Cabrera, the first Argentine to win the Masters. In the 1968 Masters, his countryman Roberto De Vicenzo appeared headed for a playoff with Bob Goalby at 11-under-par 277. But De Vicenzo signed an incorrect scorecard and was penalised a stroke.         
	He then uttered the famous quote, What a stupid I am.           NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

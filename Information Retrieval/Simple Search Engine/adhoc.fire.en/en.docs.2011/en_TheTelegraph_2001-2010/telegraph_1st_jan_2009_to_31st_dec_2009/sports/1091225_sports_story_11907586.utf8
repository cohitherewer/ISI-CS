The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB forms   7-member committee
                                                                                                                       7                                      CAB forms   7-member committee
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Jagmohan Dalmiya Thursday said that the technical snag that is causing the Eden Gardens floodlights to go off was a concern.         
	It is a worry. We are yet to identify the problem area but we need to do that very quickly. Since 1993, the ODI matches are being held under lights but only in the last couple of years have we been hit by technical snags, Dalmiya, with joint secretary Biswarup Dey by his side, told reporters after the match.         
	Dalmiya said that it was unacceptable that the lights should go out for even five minutes.         
	A seven member committee, comprising police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, DC (headquarters) Javed Shamim, former CAB joint secretary Chitrak Mitra, Sadhan Mukherjee, Dilip Sen, S. Biswas and P.K. Mullick, will look into the matter.         
	A decision will be taken after the committee submits its report.         
	Dalmiya, however, was non-committal when asked whether this was a case of sabotage. It is not possible to comment on this issue before getting a detailed report, he said.

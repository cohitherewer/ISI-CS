  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  One-time playboy Shahid Afridi gets candid         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  
	Johannesburg: Shahid Boom Boom Afridi, among the most flamboyant of cricketers for well over a decade now, spoke to The Telegraph at the Sandton Sun on Friday. The 29-year-old was frank throughout and often emotional.                 
	The following are excerpts               
	QYouve completed 13 years of international cricket today (October 2). How has this journey been?         
	A Ive learnt a lot... About good things and bad, about good people and bad... Ive also learnt what pressure means and how best to handle pressure and expectations. In fact, is beech maine hasna aur rona bhi seekha.         
	But what have you learnt the most?         
	That whether one is a good cricketer or not, he has to be a good human being. Thats very important.         
	Youre seen as a match-winner in limited overs cricket, how do you handle pressure?         
	Different people have different ways of handling it... Some talk to themselves, some talk to others... I prefer to close my eyes and take deep breaths... That helps me relax. Apne uparwale se madat bhi mangta hoon.         
	There was confusion over your temporary retirement from Test cricket...         
	The confusion was created by somebody in the media... What Id said was that if Im not going to be selected for Test cricket (last appearance was in July 2006), then I might as well call it a day and focus on ODIs and T20... After all, Id been around for a long time and even had a decent Test average, of 37-plus... What I said got misrepresented.         
	Youre Pakistans T20 captain and the vice-captain in ODIs... Were you excited when you got the T20 captaincy a few months ago?         
	Frankly, I wasnt over the moon, because I got the captaincy  whatever the form  after others, junior to me, had got the chance to lead Pakistan... Id felt somewhat hurt at being ignored, for Id been around for so many years on the strength of my performances... When the captaincy came my way, I said to myself chalo, meri bhi baari aa gayi.         
	But did you not give 100 per cent under those captains whod started their careers after you?         
	Of course I did, its the duty of every player to give 100 per cent... The countrys pride is at stake.         
	Over a period, could captaincy make you change your game?         
	Look, with (additional) responsibility, one does act a bit more responsibly. However, Im not going to change my natural game, because that alone has given me recognition and taken me to where I am. Main apni identity nahin khona chahta.         
	Dont you agree that you havent exactly done justice to your talent?         
	Youre right, I accept that...         
	So, why havent you done justice?         
	To be honest, till a few years ago, I wasnt that hard-working... Id taken it for granted that my talent alone would help me perform... I made a mistake there... Allah gave me fame and money at a very young age and I got carried away by the recognition Id been getting... Got carried away by the wah-wahs... But, to succeed, youve got to work very hard.         
	What was the turning point?         
	Around the time Bob Woolmer became the coach (summer of 2004)... Id been dropped from the Pakistan team and its Bob who convinced the Board and the selectors to bring me back... Once I got back, Bob helped raise the level of my confidence. He made me feel like a match-winner... Also instilled the importance of training hard... Bob would say that if the preparation had been good, then it wouldnt be difficult to accept failure. Ill never forget Bobs contribution to my career.         
	Nobody has forgotten your world record-creating 100 off 37 balls (against Sri Lanka) in your maiden ODI innings...         
	(Laughs) I tell people to talk of something else! Thirteen years have passed aur life bahut aage badh gayi hai.         
	Initially, at least, did that performance weigh you down?         
	Well, Id take a lot of expectations-driven pressure... Often, the roar of the crowd and the demand for sixes would make me uneasy... Id wonder what if I failed? I began to fear failure.         
	Then...         
	I decided to focus on my leg-spin and told myself I was a bowler first, not a batsman... That helped calm me and helped encourage a positive outlook. Even today, bowling is my priority.         
	Looking back, what have been the highlights of your career?         
	My Nairobi innings which made me the youngest centurion in ODIs, every win in India, winning the World T20 this June...         
	The most disappointing moment?         
	Losing in the 1999 World Cup final (to Australia) and exiting in the first-round of the 2007 World Cup... Believe me, those were very bad days.         
	Who was your hero?         
	Imran Khan... He wasnt just a great cricketer, but had an awesome personality... His looks, the way he spoke... Id also admire Sachin Tendulkar, Brian Lara, Saeed Anwar and Mark Waugh... Sachin ko TV mein dekhne se bahut mazaa aata tha...         
	Are you in touch with Imran?         
	I do speak to him occasionally... He congratulates me when I do well and, when I dont, asks me to put in more effort... Asks me to lift myself and my game... Hes always positive.         
	What does a Pakistan-India match hold for you?         
	Such matches mean everything... Even if we dont win the Champions Trophy, fans would be satisfied that we, at least, defeated India in the group stage... Thats the significance of beating India... Obviously, pressure on the players is more, especially if there has been a gap between matches... Jo log cricket nahin bhi jaante, woh bhi us din jaanne lagte hain... So, pressure is huge. Indeed, for many at home, the tournament may have ended with our win over India!         
	I assume the players, too, get much satisfaction...         
	Absolutely... A Pakistan-India match is such that no matter how big a player you are, you start from scratch in that game... You start from zero and have the opportunity to become a hero.         
	Why have you figured in controversies?         
	I didnt set out to play any part in any controversy... Everybody doesnt have to like everybody... Some captains and selectors have liked me, some havent... It has to be accepted as a part of life. Bottomline is that if you perform, then everybody likes you and, if you dont, tab aap gharwalon ko bhi pasand nahin.         
	Youve had the label of a playboy...         
	Early in my career, yes... I enjoyed my days as a bachelor and got married (to Nadia, a relative) when rather young, largely to bring about stability and discipline in my personal life. I have three daughters and I dont like long tours.         
	Todays Afridi, then, is quite different?         
	One changes with time... Today, outside cricket, I just wish to spend time with my begum and daughters... Today, wins on the cricket field bring enjoyment, not parties.         
	Is there something you wish to achieve?         
	Id like to go out on my terms, with izzat, instead of being pushed out by the Board or the selectors... Then, Id like to help win the 2011 World Cup... Ive helped the country win the World T20, now the World Cup remains.         
	Finally... You have a huge following. What would you tell your young fans whore into cricket?         
	If you want to make an impression, dream big... Cricket ke saath ishq karo... Also, respect your parents and, as important, always seek their blessings.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chetan lights up dull day for India
                                                   Chetan lights up dull day for India
            SHARMISTHA CHAUDHURI                            
	Hyderabad: As the World Badminton Championships got under way at the Gachibowli Stadium here Monday, the Indians drawn to play on the opening day got off on the wrong foot, save Chetan Anand.         
	The mens world No. 15 was the only saving grace in the Indian expedition on home soil, on Monday. He foiled the plans of Korean Ji Hoon Hong in the first round with a 21-6, 21-16 victory in 32 minutes.         
	 After being blown off in the first game with smashes from all over the court, the spirited Hong made a comeback in the second. That rattled Chetans concentration as he erred on easy points. But with the crowd egging him on, the Indian fought off the Korean in the last couple of points to win.         
	Indias second best woman shuttler after Saina Nehwal, Aditi Mutatkar, lost her first round encounter against German 11th seed Juliane Schenk. Schenks barrage of smashes and powerful forehands tired out Aditi as she made one unforced error after another. Finally, the score read 21-8, 21-12 in the Germans favour.         
	Womens 14th seed, Mew Choo Wong of Malaysia took only 19 minutes to trounce US challenger Shannon Pohl 21-4, 21-6. Beijing bronze medallist, Maria Kristin Yulianti of Indonesia defeated Swedens Sophia Hansson 21-6, 21-2.         
	The mens doubles pair of Rupesh Kumar and Sanave Thomas lost to 14th-seeded Japanese duo of Kenichi Hayakawa and Kenta Kazuno while the mixed doubles pair of Aparna Balan and Arup Vishnu were beaten by another Japanese pair  Noriyasu Hirata and Shizuka Matsuo  in their respective first round matches. Both the Indian teams lost in straight games.         
	The reigning New Zealand Open Grand Prix winners, Kumar and Thomas lost the first game 13-21. However, the world No. 18 pair came very close to extending the match into the final game when they came back strongly to challenge the Japanese pair in the second game. It was their opponents swift movements and agility on court that did their chances in. Despite staying ahead during most of the game, they squandered four game points in the second to lose 21-23.         
	The mixed doubles duo of Balan and Vishnu, who had earlier in the year been runners-up in the Spanish Open, were beaten in only 29 minutes, 14-21, 20-22.         
	Crowd favourite and World No. 5 Lin Dan of China had a cakewalk in his first round match. Dan, who is gunning for his third successive World Championship title, beat Misha Zilberman of Isreal 21-9, 21-11 in just under 25 minutes.         
	Peter Gade of Denmark, seeded third at this meet, too came off his first round challenge with ease as he beat Valeriy Atrashchenkov 21-11, 21-16 in only 29 minutes.         
	The top-seeded Lee Chong Wei of Malaysia only played consistently to defeat German Dietet Domke 21-14, 21-10 in 25 minutes. The Malay put up a superb display at the Gachibowli stadium outclassing his opponent with ease.         
	However, there was one upset in the mens singles draw as the 11th seed Chunlai Bao of China was beaten by Danish Dicky Palyama 18-21, 14-21. Sixth-seeded Indonesian Sony Dwi Kuncoro got the better of Michael Lahnsteiner of Austria 21-13, 21-9. Yan Kit Chan, the 10th seed from Hong Kong, bypassed the challenge off Kaveh Mehrabi 21-15, 21-11.         
	Day Two of the Championships will see Indians P.Kashyap, Arvind Bhat, Sayali Gokhale, the mixed doubles duo of V. Diju and Jwala Gutta, and the two remaining mens doubles teams of Tarun Kona-Arun Vishnu and Akshay Dewalkar-Jishnu Sanyal in action.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Must-win match for Dempo
                                                   Must-win match for Dempo
                      
	Margao: A crucial match is on the cards as Dempo face a must-win situation when they take on bottom-placed Al Faisaly in their last match of group E in the AFC Cup at the Nehru stadium here Tuesday. Al Maged have already qualified for the quarter finals from this group.         
	Dempo, who are three points behind group leaders Al maged, need a victory against Al Faisaly to become the second team from the group to advance to the last-eight stage. While Al Muharraq are third with six points, they need a win against Al Maged and would hope Dempo lose Al Faisaly.         
	Al Faisaly have four points and have an outside chance to make it the quarters, provided they beat Dempo by at least a two-goal margin.         
	Dempo started on the right note, beating Al Faisaly and Al Maged, but drew against Al Muharraq. They lost their next two matches in succession and are now in a tight corner.         
	Dempo will be looking forward to their strikers, Ranty Martins and Roberto Mendes Silva for success. The duo will be backed by their strong midfield, comprising Climax Lawerence, Rodrigo, Anthony Fernandes and Clifford Miranda. The return of defender Valeriano Rebelo will strengthen the back line. The weather is also against the visitors who have arrived late with only 15 players and have little time to adjust to the rising mercury.

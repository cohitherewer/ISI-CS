                                                     Buchanan on ECB radar for Ashes
                  John Buchanan                     
	London: Former Australia and World Cup winning coach John Buchanan is being targeted by England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to guide Andrew Strauss and Co. in this years Ashes series.         
	ECB managing director Hugh Morris heaped praise on Buchanan, who is currently adviser-in-charge of the Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	England, without a coach after Peter Moores was sacked, suffered a humiliating innings and 23-run defeat to the West Indies in the first Test and officials are desperate to arrest the slide with the Ashes series round the corner.         
	John Buchanan of Australia has won 75 per cent of matches at all levels, far more than anyone in the history of the game, said Morris, adding that the ECB would shortly advertise for a performance director.         
	We are looking for the best man for the job, someone who can create a positive atmosphere in the team, manage people well, manage coaches well, perhaps coach as well, and Im confident we will find the right person to do that.         
	Asked whether Buchanan needs to apply or he would be sought out by the board, Morris said: Initially, well open the process up. We would like it in place for the Ashes but it is most important to get the right man, he was quoted as saying in a daily.         
	Morris plans to hold discussions with managers of Englands football and rugby teams to chalk out the responsibilities of the performance director.         
	I would like to talk to Martin Johnson and Fabio Capello about how things are done in their sports but I wouldnt be in favour of an all-powerful manager, no. It is essential that the captain has a say in aspects on the field, that coaches control specific areas and that there is a national selector. If the manager took responsibility from the captain, it wouldnt work.         
	Morris also claimed removing Kevin Pietersen from captaincy was a hard decision.         
	Kevin is a world-class player and a good man. He is passionate about doing well. We tried to move forward with a shared vision and a shared direction but it was not possible and the decision had to be made, said Morris.

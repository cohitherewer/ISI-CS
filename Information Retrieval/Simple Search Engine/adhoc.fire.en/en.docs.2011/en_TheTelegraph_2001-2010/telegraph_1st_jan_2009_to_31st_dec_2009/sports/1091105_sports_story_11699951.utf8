The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Asad waiting in the wings 
                                                                                                                                     Asad waiting in the wings 
            A STAFF REPORTER            Asaduddin                                 
	Calcutta: Mohammed Azharuddin always had a special connection with the City of Joy. But for his elder son Asaduddin  Abbas to his teammates  time probably has not come to make a mark in the city. To grab a headline something on the lines of like father, like son.         
	The 20-year-old Mohammed Asaduddin, is in town for the second time  previously he came for a three-day failed trial with the Kolkata Knight Riders in January  as a part of the Hyderabad U-22 squad. They are taking on Bengal in a CK Nayudu Trophy Elite League match at the Jadavpur University, Salt Lake campus.         
	This is the first time I have been selected to represent a state side. I havent played in any other age-group level BCCI tournament before this, the lanky teenager, who is not in the playing XI, informed.         
	I have had a good club season for East Marredapally CC in the local Hyderabad league scoring two 100s and a 50, he added.         
	Ask him about his KKR experience, he goes on a defensive mode. My dad has instructed me not to interact with the media.         
	May be it has something to do with the hype generated during the KKR trials which made him a bit jittery.         
	He was not there during our first two matches. We just want him to feel comfortable with the squad before we give him a start, Hyderabad coach P Ramesh Kumar said.

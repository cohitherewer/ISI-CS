                                                   Dipika in last four
                      
	Chennai: Top-seeded Indian Dipika Pallikal brushed aside the challenge of Nouran El Torky of Egypt to advance to the semi-final of the 13th World Junior (Men and Women) Squash Championship here Friday.         
	Playing before a cheering crowd, Pallikal beat the fifth seeded Egyptian opponent 11-5, 4-11, 11-8, 11-6 in 37 minutes.         
	Pallikal faces 13-year-old and fourth seed Nour El Tayeb of Egypt in the semi-finals Saturday. Tayeb, who recently became the youngest ever player to reach the final of a WISPA event, eliminated her compatriot Salma Hany 11-7, 11-6, 11-1 in 21 minutes.         
	Having played three preliminary round matches without much resistance from her opponents, Pallikal was tested for the first time in the tournament, though briefly. (PTI)

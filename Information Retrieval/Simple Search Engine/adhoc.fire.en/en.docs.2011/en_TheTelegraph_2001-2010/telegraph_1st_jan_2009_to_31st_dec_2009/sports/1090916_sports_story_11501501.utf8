            OUR CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES            Sachin Tendulkar speaks during a condolence meeting for Raj Singh Dungarpur at the CCI on Tuesday. (PTI)                           
	Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar on Tuesday dedicated his match-winning century against Sri Lanka in the tri-series final to Raj Singh Dungarpur, the former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president who died here on Saturday.         
	Rajbhais death is a personal loss to me. Its difficult to overcome. Wherever Rajbhai is, I am sure he was watching us (win the final in Colombo) yesterday (Monday). My hundred was for Rajbhai, Tendulkar said during a condolence meeting at the Cricket Club of India (CCI), where Dungarpur served as the president for more than a decade until two years ago.         
	I also strongly feel that the main gate (of the CCI, which houses the historic Brabourne Stadium) should be named after Rajbhai, quot; Tendulkar, who hit an epic 138 off 133 balls in the final, said.         
	Whenever I scored runs, Rajbhai was among the first to call and wish me ... I will miss him.         
	He recalled the immense help provided to him by Dungarpur that shaped his later career.         
	I was 13 or 14 and I was selected to go to England with the Star Cricket Club. Coming from a middle class family we were not in a position to stay in England for one month. Rajbhai was instrumental in getting me a sponsor to go to England. It was a terrific experience, the ace batsman said.         
	Tendulkar also remembered how Dungarpur, then donning the role of the national selection panel chief saw him at the nets held at the CCI and was impressed.         
	I played one of my most important matches, batting in the schools final (at the CCI) for two days and Rajbhai sat right through the match along with Dilip Vengsarkar. It was an experience for a 14-year old when the selection committee chairman was watching you. Later he gave me lots of encouragement and told me you play your natural game, he said.         
	Among others who paid tributes to Dungarpur were former India players Nari Contractor and Vengsarkar.

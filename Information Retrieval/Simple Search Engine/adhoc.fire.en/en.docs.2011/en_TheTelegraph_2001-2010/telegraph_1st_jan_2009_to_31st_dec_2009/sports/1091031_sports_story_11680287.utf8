                                                     Injury-hit United face grim battle
  - Chelsea take on Bolton; Arsenal host Spurs       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Rio Ferdinand (left) and Nemanja Vidic, both down with injruies, are likely to sit out on Saturday                                 
	London: Manchester Uniteds hopes of emulating Chelsea by beating Blackburn and taking over the Premier League pole on Saturday look slim because of a spate of injuries.         
	United may struggle even for victory with Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand both fighting calf problems and possibly set to join Darren Fletcher, Gary Neville, Park Ji-sung and Danny Welbeck on the sidelines.         
	And with Chelsea going into their game at Bolton having hammered 13 goals in three matches following last weekends 5-0 win over Blackburn, even victory for United is unlikely to be enough to regain the top spot.         
	The two centre-halves, both criticised for their performances in the 0-2 defeat against Liverpool at Anfield last Sunday, have not trained this week and are doubts for the clash with swine flu victims Blackburn.         
	Ferguson said: Rio and Vida are both doubts and we will just have to see what happens. With Gary Neville suspended, we are hoping that we can get one or two fit, but it looks like an uphill battle at the moment.         
	We face an uphill fight to get players fit for tomorrow, the Scot added.         
	Chelsea have no such worries ahead of their game at Bolton, the team they beat 4-0 in the League Cup this week. Midfielder Joe Cole is back from 10 months out and set up two goals in Wednesdays game and Chelsea can also recall John Terry, Frank Lampard, Ricardo Carvalho and Nicolas Anelka after resting them on in the midweek. Ashley Cole, too, may return from an ankle problem.         
	Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard and defender Glen Johnson have been ruled out of Saturdays trip to Fulham, but striker Fernando Torres is expected to play.         
	Gerrard is still recovering after injuring his groin while playing with England this month. Midfielder Alberto Aquilani could play at Fulham despite picking up a virus after making his debut in Wednesdays League Cup loss at Arsenal.         
	Liverpool ended a four-match winless streak by beating United and, although a second-string side lost at Arsenal 1-2 in the League Cup, they get the first real test of their revival at Fulham on Saturday.         
	Arsenal have the chance to re-establish their title credentials while at the same time asserting their superiority over neighbours Tottenham Hotspur in the north London derby at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday.         
	Arsenal have not lost to Spurs in the Premier League for 19 matches and almost 10 years, but Spurs make the short trip along the Seven Sisters Road on something of a high after making their best start to a season for a long time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AFC backing for Bhutia
                                                     AFC backing for Bhutia
            OUR BUREAU            Bhaichung Bhutia                           
	New Delhi/Calcutta: Mohun Bagan officials once again found themselves at the receiving end when the website of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) criticised the Calcutta club for issuing a show-cause notice to Bhaichung Bhutia.         
	Five days after the national coach Bob Houghton praised Bhaichungs commitment and dedication as a footballer, the AFC website warned that the green and maroon brigade could well become the fallen giants of Indian football.         
	With Mohun Bagans hopes of continental football hanging on the Federation Cup in December, soul-searching seems to be in order if they are to avoid becoming the fallen giants of Indian football, the website commented.         
	Ridiculing Bagans performance in the AFC Cup, AFC said: The pedigreed outfit from India is desperately searching for answers after concluding a woeful campaign in the AFC Cup, shipping 19 goals and scoring just one in six group outings.         
	Whats worse is that the Calcutta giants might have lost charismatic player and captain Bhaichung Bhutia to archrivals East Bengal after a very public falling-out, it said.         
	Commenting that the timing of the show-cause notice to Bhaichung was inappropriate, the AFC website said: The controversy has tarnished Mohun Bagans reputation. Moreover, the clubs action against Bhutia has upset the fans.         
	Reacting to these strong words, club secretary Anjan Mitra said Bagan would send a detailed report to the AFC clarifying what led to Bhaichungs show cause.         
	We will send a report to AFC and also to Fifa if they ask for it.         
	Too many people are commenting on this issue without knowing anything. How could Bhaichung have played the last AFC Cup match (against Al Karamah) when he did not even report 48 hours before the kick-off.         
	It was not possible for the coach (Karim Bencharifa) to keep him in the squad, Mitra said from Kalimpong.         
	Mitra said that the Asian body was not right in criticising Bagan for their dismal performance in the AFC Cup.         
	Our team was in the strongest group, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lalawmpuiya is upbeat for semis
                                                   Lalawmpuiya is upbeat for semis
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: More than scoring goals, P.C. Lalawmpuiya is happy to get starts in successive matches in the ongoing Santosh Trophy.         
	I have scored many match winners during my three-year stay at Mohun Bagan. But I dont remember when I played three matches on the trot, Lalawmpuiya said after a session with the masseur at the team hotel, here on Tuesday evening.         
	Happy to hit the headlines and, for once, not for the wrong reasons, the Mizo striker attributed his success to teamwork. Its a team effort. May be I am scoring the goals, but you cant overlook my teammates contribution. Surojit (Roys) pass against Punjab was fantastic, Lalawmpuiya tries to drive home his point.         
	Lalawmpuiya said he feels Bengal will win the semi-final against Services on Wednesday. We will win. Take it from me. We are on a roll right now. No one can stop us, he said.         
	Talking about his decision to move to Chirag United, Lalawmpuiya said it was a conscious decision.         
	Chirag have ambition and its much better than sitting on the bench for a big club, he said.         
	In Chirag I will be the main striker and that will allow me to be more responsible, more restrained, he said.

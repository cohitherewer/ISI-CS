                                                   Destiny in our hands: Pollock
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Centurion: The Mumbai Indians team mentor Shaun Pollock said it was good for the side that players like Dwayne Bravo and Ajinkya Rahane were stepping up and performing.         
	Speaking to the media at the post-match news conference after the Mumbai Indians eight-wicket victory against the Kings XI Punjab on Tuesday night, the former South African all-rounder said he was impressed with the manner in which the team won.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q The team has been fielding so well. How much of an impact has Jonty Rhodes had on this Mumbai Indians team?         
	A Obviously Jonty has been working hard with everyone. Sachin got a direct hit today (Tuesday). They are putting in the time. As the tournament goes on, as the pressure situations come about, your fielding needs to be as good as it can possibly be.         
	Sachin usually likes to open. Why did he come in the middle order in this match?         
	Sachin obviously discussed it with Bravo (who opened with Sanath Jayasuriya on Tuesday). It is a nice situation for us to have, to be adaptable to the circumstances and the conditions.         
	Players like Ajinkya Rahane and Bravo are finally coming good         
	We have always said that it is an 11-man game and everyone needs to try and perform as well as they possibly can. If you got all 11 performing as well as they can, theres a good chance you will continue winning games. Obviously the guys who havent performed are now stepping up to the plate. It is important for us because a lot of the main players cant keep doing the job.         
	How relieved are you with todays result?         
	I wouldnt say relieved. I am really happy with the way the guys have played, the way they have bounced back. The way the victory came about was impressive. We are back in the competition And destiny is in our own hands.         
	Do you think the IPL is more suited to grounds like the ones in South Africa which have something for the bowlers?         
	I dont know if the wickets have offered more here than in India. I have played on a few wickets in India where they have offered a lot of assistance to the spinners.         
	What are your thoughts on Harbhajan Singh being economical and not really going for the wickets?         
	I think we sorted out the role Harbhajan was going to play. We have clearly worked out the best time for him to come and bowl.

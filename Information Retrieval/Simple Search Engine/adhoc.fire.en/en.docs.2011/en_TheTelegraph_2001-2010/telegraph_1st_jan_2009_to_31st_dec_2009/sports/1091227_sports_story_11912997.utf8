The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England give Proteas a jolt
                                                                                                                       7                                        England give Proteas a jolt

	Durban: England ran out South Africa captain Graeme Smith among a burst of three quick wickets to reduce the hosts to 175 for five on the Day I of the second Test on Saturday.         
	Smith and Jacques Kallis made solid half-centuries in a partnership of 150 to rescue their side from deep trouble at 10 for two but both fell in quick succession before bad light ended play early with England on top.         
	We did really well to get to tea with just two wickets down after it had obviously been tough in the morning with the ball going around so much, so to end five down was very frustrating, Kallis said.         
	The run out was especially frustrating, but that sort of thing happens often in cricket and you just have to accept it and get on with the game.         
	Smith fell for 75 after playing a defensive stroke to a ball from Graham Onions, AB de Villiers impetuously charging through for a single before sending his captain back and leaving him stranded.         
	I thought England bowled exceptionally well and they made it particularly hard for us in the morning when they bowled in the right areas and got the ball to move around, Kallis said.         
	The South Africans scored only 15 runs in the first 13 overs as England made light of losing the toss by removing Ashwell Prince and Hashim Amla.           (REUTERS)

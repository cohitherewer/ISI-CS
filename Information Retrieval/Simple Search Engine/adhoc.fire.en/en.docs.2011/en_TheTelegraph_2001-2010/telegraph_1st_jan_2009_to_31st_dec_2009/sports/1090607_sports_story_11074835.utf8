The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal in semi-final
                                                     Bengal in semi-final
                  Action during the Bengal vs Punjab match at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Chennai on Saturday                     
	Chennai: Defending champions Punjab crashed out of the national football championships for the Santosh Trophy going down 1-2 to Bengal in their last quarter final league group A match Saturday.         
	Bengal stormed into the semi-finals finishing on top of the table with five points (one win and two draws). Tamil Nadu (four points), who scored a 3-1 win over Manipur earlier in the day, was the other team to qualify. P Muthu scored a hattrick for the hosts, while Bijen Singh netted the consolation goal.         
	After missing a couple of chances, Bengal shot into the lead in the 33rd minute when Snehasish Chakraborty scored off a combined move. Punjab restored parity in the 54th minute through P.C. Lahlimthara Mahlima.         
	Bengals winning goal came in the 84th minute when P.C. Lalawmpuiya scored a stunning goal.         
	Punjab forwards let them down as they lacked co-ordination.         
	On the other hand, Bengal forwards used the flanks and split the Punjab defence on many occasions.         
	Snehasish once again excelled with his ball control and put Subho Kumar in front and moved up to receive the ball back.         
	He then chipped it over the on-rushing goalkeeper Karanjit Singh. (PTI)

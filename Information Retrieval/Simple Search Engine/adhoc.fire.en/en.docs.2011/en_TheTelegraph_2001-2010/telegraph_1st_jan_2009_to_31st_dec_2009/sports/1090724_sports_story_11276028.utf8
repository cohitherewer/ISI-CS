The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Contador takes stage 18 
                                                     Contador takes stage 18 
                  Alberto Contador                     
	Annecy: Alberto Contador won the final time trial in the Tour de France on Thursday, and Lance Armstrong moved up one spot to third place overall.         
	Contador now looks all but assured of his second Tour victory after increasing his overall lead in the 18th stage, in which riders embarked one-by-one down the start ramp for the 40.5-kilometer (25.2-mile) stage in and around Annecy.         
	The 2007 champion finished the stage in 48 minutes, 31 seconds  beating Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland by 3 seconds. Russias Mikhail Ignatiev was third, 15 seconds back.         
	I went all out, said Contador, adding that his earpiece radio linking him with Astana team managers stopped working during the stage, and that he was worried about Cancellaras skill at time trials. Of course, what I especially wanted was to think about general class. A stage victory was less important, he said.         
	Armstrong was 15th, 1:30 behind. But he easily overcame a 30-second deficit to Frank Schleck, who began the day in third place but slipped to sixth overall after finishing 2:34 behind Contador.

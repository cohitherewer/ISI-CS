The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Do-or-die for both sides
                                                   Do-or-die for both sides
                      
	Pretoria: A resurgent Royal Challengers Bangalore will clash with the Deccan Chargers in a virtual quarter final here Thursday as the race for a semi-final berth in the Indian Premier League nears a thrilling climax.         
	The Royal Challengers, who started the second season of the IPL with an upset win over defending champions Rajasthan Royals, need a victory in the last match to make it to the last four. The loser of the match will have to depend on a better net run rate to pip the Kings XI Punjab at the post.         
	What makes this match even more interesting is that the Challengers and the Chargers finished seventh and eighth respectively last season but have made a significant progress to press for a semi-final spot this time.         
	And both teams, with 14 points from 13 matches, would now hope to make all the hard work count.         
	The Chargers, after a dazzling start, have been inconsistent, allowing others to catch up.         
	Inconsistency has also been a constant with the Royal Challengers. They have won seven of their 13 matches, losing six, the same as the Chargers. But of late, they have hit a purple patch, having beaten the Chennai Super Kings, the Kolkata Knight Riders and the Delhi Daredevils in their last three encounters.         
	The Royal Challengers have done well so far under Anil Kumbles astute leadership. At the same time, they have shown a tendency of relying heavily on the batting of Jacques Kallis.         
	They have some clean hitters in Ross Taylor and Robin Uthappa, but they need to provide Kallis support against a bowling attack that boasts RP Singh, the tournaments highest wicket-taker so far, with 19 scalps.         
	Kumbles guile will be tested against the likes of Adam Gilchrist and Herschelle Gibbs at the top of the order, while Andrew Symonds and Rohit Sharma can trouble many with their big hitting in the middle.

                                                   Somdev draws Prakash
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Somdev Dev Varman has drawn compatriot Prakash Amritraj in the first round of the Australian Open qualifying singles starting in Melbourne from Wednesday.         
	Somdev, ranked 154, is scheduled to play Amritraj on Wednesday in the sixth match on Court 6 at Melbourne Park. Play begins at 4.30 am IST on all courts. The 23-year-old is seeded 16th in the 128-size draw from which 16 qualify for the main draw. The tournament proper begins on Monday.         
	Somdev has been in scintillating form of late. He made history last week when he became the first Indian to reach the singles final of Chennai Open, the oldest ATP tournament of the country.         
	Although the 23-year-old lost the final to Croatian Marin Cilic, his performance earned him a lot of praise.

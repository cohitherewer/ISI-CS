	New Delhi: Chicken pox has rendered Saina Nehwal doubtful for next months World Badminton Championship even though the ace shuttler remains hopeful of competing in the high-profile event at her home town Hyderabad.         
	Saina, has been suffering from mild fever since Saturday and it was only on Wednesday that she was diagnosed with chicken pox and was advised complete bed rest for the next few days.         
	I have been suffering from fever since Saturday but its yesterday (Wednesday) that I saw some pockmarks appearing on the skin.         
	Initially, I thought it must be pimples or boils but in the last couple of days some more pockmarks developed and I had this itchy feeling, Saina said from Hyderabad.         
	So we decided to see the doctor, who confirmed that I have chicken pox. I have been advised rest for the next 4-5 days and then Ill see how it goes, she said.         
	It is very disappointing and shocking for me as the World Championship is just round the corner.         
	But there are no immediate concerns about my participation in the tournament as of now. I will visit the doctor after a few days and then take a call, added Saina.         
	Saina, however, admitted that even if she manages to regain fitness ahead of the event starting August 10, she would be low on practice.         
	I know I will lose valuable practice time because I have been training really well for the last one month. It is not that I cannot train but with the sweating and all, I will need to bathe and during pox you cannot shower, else it might deteriorate, she added.         
	Her coach Pullela Gopichand was equally upset but he too sounded hopeful of Sainas recovery before the championship.         
	These things happen in life, you cannot help. I am hopeful she will recover in time for the World Championship, he said.         
	The doctor said it is not a problem, she just needs to take rest. So Saina is having proper care and medicines. Lets see We can only wait and see how things shape up, Gopichand said.

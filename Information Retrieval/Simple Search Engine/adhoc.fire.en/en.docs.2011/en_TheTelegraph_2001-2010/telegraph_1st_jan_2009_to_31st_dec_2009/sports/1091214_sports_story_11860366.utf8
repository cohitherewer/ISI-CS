The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Suranjoy: A cool head did it for me 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Suranjoy: A cool head did it for me 
                      
	New Delhi: Suranjoy Singh, the first Indian boxer to clinch a gold medal at the inter-continental Presidents Cup, Sunday attributed his success to anger management, which has helped him evolve from a street fighter to a champion pugilist.         
	The 22-year-old flyweight pugilist, who was also adjudged the best boxer of the season-ending event, said earlier he used to lose focus too often due to his short temper.         
	I used to lose my cool very easily in the ring. For instance, if my opponent landed a good punch or fouled me, it would make me so angry that I would just forget about the bout and try to beat up the other guy, Suranjoy said, after returning to the country from Baku.         
	The Manipuri, employed with the Indian Navy, said it was before the Asian championships, where he broke a 15-year jinx to fetch India a gold medal, that he realised how damaging his temper had been to his career.         
	The coaches talked sense into me, made me realise how important it was to focus my energy on the real task.         
	I also did some introspection and thought may be I should change myself a bit. I adopted a calmer approach and it worked fantastically well in the Asian championships, he said.         
	I now focus on scoring points and winning the bout. I dont lose my cool and this has made me a better boxer, he added.         
	National coach Gurbax Singh Sandhu said the change has worked wonders for the diminutive boxer.         
	He would turn into a street fighter at the slightest provocation and this approach ruined him. But he has changed for the better now and the good results are coming, he said.

    - Bottom-placed teams of the inaugural edition to clash in the 2009 title round           OUR BUREAU                            
	The two bottom-placed teams of IPL edition No.1 are in the final this year. The Deccan Chargers and the Royal Challengers Bangalore couldnt have expected a better turnaround. The tag of the Test team seems a distant memory for the Royal Challengers. On Saturday, they beat the Chennai Super Kings by six wickets to storm into the title-round. This was their fifth win on the trot.         
	Expectedly, there were emotional scenes in the Royal Challengers hospitality box even as the mood was anything but happy in the Super Kings enclosure, which was packed with BCCI officials. Secretary N. Srinivasan, after all, has a huge stake in the franchise.         
	Vijay Mallya, who chose to skip the Monaco GP and decided to spend the weekend in Johannesburg, was absolutely ecstatic. Over the moon too was Bollywood beauty (and Royal Challengers brand ambassador) Katrina Kaif, who promptly gave Mallya a peck on his left cheek. I just asked the boys to enjoy themselves and forget that this was a semi-final, Mallya said.         
	Back in England Kevin Pietersen must also be a delighted man, having led this team in the first few games. But Anil Kumble proved to be the man with the magic wand, recording his seventh win in nine matches for the Royal Challengers.         
	Having set the Royal Challengers 147 for victory, Mahendra Singh Dhoni amp; Co. thought of it as a challenging total. In the end, though, the Super Kings captain was forced to admit that they were some 15 runs short.         
	Manish Pandey, who came out of nowhere and scored a century in the last game, did the star turn yet again. His 35-ball 48 almost made it smooth sailing for Kumbles men.         
	Kumble was hoping they would carry the momentum into the final.               
	The following are excerpts         
	KUMBLE: This victory was great, but one more win will be nice... It was a brilliant show from all the boys. We rallied around and came back strongly 146 on this wicket was not at all a passing score and I think our bowlers did a brilliant job to restrict them to such a low total. Later, Manish played an excellent innings at the top of the order and had a vital partnership with Rahul (Dravid). Virat (Kohli) finished it off superbly at the end The youngsters, like Manish, are fearless and back themselves to clear the boundaries. Thats the beauty of Twenty20. It was an excellent innings from him. Our bowling in the last five overs was clinical.         
	DHONI: The wicket was a bit on the slower side initially, but became better later on. They simply played better and bowled better than us today. The way the wicket played, 160 would have been an ideal total. But we lost wickets at crucial junctures We didnt bowl well the ball was coming on nicely and any width offered on this pitch would spell trouble. We just didnt bowl well.

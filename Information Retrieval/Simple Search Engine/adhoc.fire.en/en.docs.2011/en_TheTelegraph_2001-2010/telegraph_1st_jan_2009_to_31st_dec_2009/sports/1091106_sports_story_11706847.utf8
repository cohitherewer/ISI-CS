  - Ricky Ponting rsquo;s men go to Guwahati with a 3-2 lead 
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                              
	Hyderabad: Sachin Tendulkars 17,000 runs and 45th century will not be the stuff of fond memories as the Indian late-order collapsed in a heap in the end overs on Thursday.         
	The target of 351 had looked within their reach when Sachins miscued paddle scoop off Clint McKay was taken by Nathan Haurtiz. India needed 19 runs from 17 balls at that stage.         
	But two suicidal run outs and a dolly catch to Michael Hussey 15 balls later meant they had fallen three runs short. It was an anti-climax to what had been a scintillating chase. The Australian fielding had made all the difference. India trail in the Hero Honda Cup 2-3 and must win in Guwahati to keep the series alive. The 175 off 141 balls was a Sachin masterpiece which had class written all over and will rank among his very best. What better way to celebrate reaching the 17,000-run milestone than scoring a hundred!         
	It was an amazing innings. For the majority of their innings we had our backs to the wall... One of the outstanding innings Ive seen, said Ricky Ponting. You dont see such innings every day. He hit almost every shot from the middle of the bat.         
	It may have been an one-dayer, but the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in nearby Uppal had all the makings of a T20 match  live music, a DJ, a capacity crowd and a thrilling finish. No doubt they got their every pennys worth although the end proved to be disappointing.         
	It was meant to be Sachins day from the moment he stepped out to bat. Coming out of a relatively lean patch, the master showed he was in supreme touch on the day.         
	The seven runs must have been at the back of his mind as he took guard. A cautious approach meant that he remained stuck on six for four deliveries before clipping Ben Hilfenhaus past square leg off the 17th ball to reach the milestone.  
	Thereafter on this small ground, fours and sixes flowed as Sachin toyed with a below par Australian attack sans Mitchell Johnson. Once the other top-order batsmen crumbled, Raina forged the crucial 137-run fifth wicket partnership off 114 balls with Sachin.         
	It was a typical demonstration of Sachins enduring skill and indomitable will. Without compromising on grace and style, he created disarray in the rival bowling. It was a timely reminder of how much his presence means for this side going into the 2011 World Cup.         
	Once Sachin had settled down, the chase looked in control. Slower balls were picked up early and dispatched over the infield while anything short was cut and pulled away mercilessly. The flick of the wrist, the ability to find the gaps, the self-belief and the refusal to regard any cause as lost reminded one of his abilities.         
	The acceleration was remarkable  from 10 off 19, he raced to 50 off 47, 100 off only 81 and 150 off 122 balls. The 19 boundaries and four sixes were testimony to the authority he commanded.         
	There was a stunning pulled six off Shane Watson and two consecutive vintage straight sixes off Nathan Hauritz ensured he was out of the attack. Once Adam Voges pulled off a stunner at point to send Mahendra Singh Dhoni back, it looked like Sachin was battling for a lost cause. But Raina proved equal to the task once he joined Sachin.         
	Having survived a sharp chance at slip for nought, the young left-hander seemed inspired by the sight of such marvellous strokeplay. Nothing shook his resolve or deflected his concentration. A miscued pull ended his run-a-ball 59 that had three fours and three sixes.         
	The Australians scintillating start, after Ricky Ponting won the toss, paled in comparison. On a perfectly laid out pitch, openers Watson and Shaun Marsh laid the platform with a 145-run opening stand and the rest ensured the momentum wasnt lost.         
	As the top-order found the confidence and got their feet moving, they destroyed an Indian attack that deflated swiftly like a pricked balloon. The 350 for four in 50 overs was a perfect display of their might and control of the proceedings.         
	For a team dogged by injuries almost by the day, they showed no trouble putting together what proved to be a competitive total in the end. Once Watson and Marsh got going, there was no stopping the visitors.         
	In compiling his maiden hundred (112 off 112 balls, 8x4, 2x6), the left-hander showed a good mix of caution and aggression. Geoff Marshs son  who has a good grasp of the Indian conditions by virtue of his stint for the Chennai Super Kings in the inaugural Indian Premier League  seems to have inherited the determination of his father while adopting a no frills approach.         
	Shauns uncomplicated approach came in handy as he was content playing second fiddle once Watson launched into the Indian attack.         
	Shaun looked happy rotating the strike as Watson inflicted damage with a boundary fest. Watson added only three after Yuvraj dropped a caught and bowled chance on 90. It took 89 balls and contained nine boundaries and three sixes.

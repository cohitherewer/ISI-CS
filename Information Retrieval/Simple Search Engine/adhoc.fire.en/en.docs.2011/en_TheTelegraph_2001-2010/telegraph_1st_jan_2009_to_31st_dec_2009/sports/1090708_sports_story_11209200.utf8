	Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Boards legal battle to force the sports governing body to restore its rights as a 2011 World Cup co-host will continue after a domestic court extended a stay on the relocation of the organising committees headquarters from Lahore to India.         
	Taffzul Rizvi, a legal adviser for the PCB, said a Pakistan court on Tuesday extended the stay of deliberations at the request of the ICC.         
	The ICC had requested the court that since theres a meeting of the World Cup co-hosts later this month, the date should be extended, Rizvi said.         
	The ICC announced that Pakistan would be stripped of rights to host World Cup matches and the organising committees head office would relocate to Mumbai. (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Event risks sanctions over Shahar denial
                                                     Event risks sanctions over Shahar denial
                  Shahar Peer                     
	Paris: The lucrative Dubai tournament risks being struck from the womens tennis calendar after the United Arab Emirates refused a visa to Israeli player Shahar Peer, the head of the WTA tour said Monday.         
	Larry Scott said barring entry to Peer could have ramifications beyond tennis because it threatens the principle that sports and politics should not mix.         
	Scott said the WTA will consider what types of sanctions are going to be deemed appropriate in light of what has happened, including whether or not the tournament has a slot on the calendar next year.         
	Asked if there is a risk that the tournament could be dropped if Peer does not get redress, Scott replied: You could say that, yes.         
	Theres two things we need to consider: whats the future fate of the Dubai tournament and what sanctions apply and the second thing is how does Shahar get treated fairly, how does her situation get redressed? Scott, the WTA tours chairman and CEO, said.         
	The UAE rejected Peers visa request a day before she was to arrive for the $2 million Dubai Tennis Championships, which includes all the top-10 womens players.         
	Organisers gave Peer no reason for the rejection, but it appeared to be due to anti-Israel sentiments in the Gulf state, particularly after last months three-week war between Israel and Islamic militants in Gaza.         
	Meanwhile, former world No.1 Amelie Mauresmo led a chorus of condemnation against the visa denial.         
	Its not acceptable, said Mauresmo after clinching the Paris Open title Sunday.         
	I think sport should be above issues like that to do with religion and wars and whatever. Im surprised.         
	Russias Olympic champion Elena Dementieva, the runner-up to Mauresmo in Paris, said she had great sympathy for Peer.         
	I just feel sad for her. She really cares about whats going on between Israel and Palestine and its just a very tough situation. I think the tour takes it seriously and I wish she could play in Dubai, said Dementieva.         
	French Open champion Ana Ivanovic said she was saddened by the episode.         
	Its very unfortunate, I feel very sorry for her. Shahar is a friend of mine and I feel sorry shes not here, said Ivanovic who is in Dubai.         
	Its always a pity to mix politics and sport. But the WTA is looking into it, she added. (agencies)

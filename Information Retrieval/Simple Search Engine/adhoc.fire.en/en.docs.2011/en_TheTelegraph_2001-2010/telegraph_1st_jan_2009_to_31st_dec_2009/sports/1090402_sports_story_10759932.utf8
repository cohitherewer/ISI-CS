The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bencharifa set to stay
                                                   Bencharifa set to stay
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Karim Bencharifa is set to stay as Mohun Bagan coach for one more year. And if everything goes accordingly, he may sign on the dotted line this week. According to a club source, Bagan and the Moroccan have had some very fruitful meetings and everything will be finalised in a few days.         
	Bencharifa said that it was always nice to feel wanted. When I first came here (in June 2008) I never thought that I would be staying for another season. But the club showed interest in retaining my services and I see no reason why I shouldnt reciprocate, the Moroccan told The Telegraph.         
	Bencharifa have been highly successful in his very first season. Bagan have won two titles  the Calcutta League and Federation Cup  and are still in the running for the I-League.         
	The green-and-maroon brigade had a 10-match winning streak in the I-League, which even the Fifa took notice of and carried an interview of the coach in its website. The only blip was the 0-3 loss at the hands of East Bengal, which ended Bagans two-year unbeaten streak against their arch-rivals.         
	Bencharifa, however, refused to divulge the list of players he would have liked to have in his team next season. That is probably because of the impending budget cut by Bagan, and also the fact that many outstation players do not see Calcutta football as lucrative as it used to be.

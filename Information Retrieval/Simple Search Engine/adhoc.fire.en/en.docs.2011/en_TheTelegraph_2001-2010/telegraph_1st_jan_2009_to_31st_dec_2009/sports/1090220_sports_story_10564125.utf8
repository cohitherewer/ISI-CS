	St Johns: Ramnaresh Sarwan and Shivnarine Chanderpaul shared an unbroken century partnership on Thursday as the West Indies frustrated Englands victory pursuit on the fifth and final day of the third cricket Test at the Antigua Recreation Ground.               
	At 12am, the West Indies were 253 for the loss of four wickets. Shivnarine Chanderpaul (52) and Brendan Nash (1) were at the crease. Ramnaresh Sarwan was out for 106.               
	Sarwan hit an unbeaten 73 and Chanderpaul added 40 not out as the home team, resuming on 143 for three, went to lunch on 196 for three after a rain-shortened first session.         
	Sarwan followed his century in the first Test and a fine 94 in the first innings with another fluent performance. The 28-year-old struck eight fours off 146 balls in just over three hours.         
	Chanderpaul, eager to make up for two cheap dismissals in the series, notched four boundaries off 96 deliveries in 144 minutes.         
	Morning showers gave the visitors early problems as the start was delayed by an hour and a quarter.         
	Once play began, England was left with 87 overs to pry out the West Indies, set an unlikely victory target of 503.         
	Captain Andrew Strauss used his four frontline bowlers but Andrew Flintoff, suffering from an injured hip, was not called upon despite being on the field throughout the session.         
	Fast bowler Flintoff is set to undergo a scan when the teams travel to Barbados on Friday to assess the extent of his injury and the tourists are reluctant to damage their talismanic all-rounder here.         
	Meanwhile, England have called up Kent pacer Amjad Khan and Essex allrounder Ravi Bopara as cover for the injured Andrew Flintoff.         
	The former England captain has been struggling with a right hip problem during the ongoing third Test and is now due to have a scan on Friday. He only bowled three overs on Wednesday.

                                                   Not taking Pakistan lightly: Clarke
                      
	Dubai: Pakistan will aim to capitalise on world No.2 Australias slump in form in a five-match one-day series starting Wednesday.         
	Australia have not played a one-dayer against Pakistan since February 2005, and have been performing way below their best  with their air of invincibility very much snuffed out         
	To make matters worse, Australia will be without several key players. They have decided to rest captain Ricky Ponting, Michael Hussey and Mitchell Johnson. Michael Clarke will lead in Pontings absence. They have also lost key fast bowler Brett Lee to an ankle injury. He has been replaced by left-arm pacer Doug Bollinger.         
	Despite those notable absentees, Clarke hopes Australia will be able to improve on their recent results.         
	Its a different opposition, completely different conditions from where we are coming from and I hope we take some confidence from the last game we won in South Africa, said Clarke. His team, however, are not underestimating Pakistan, despite having beaten them in nine of their last 10 matches.         
	I think Pakistan are a strong side and I guess they will feel more like home than us because of the heat and other conditions, said Clarke.         
	With several teams, including Australia, refusing to visit Pakistan because of fears for their safety, Pakistan captain Younis Khan admitted they had not played enough top-notch cricket.Its a very significant series for us because we did not play against big teams last year and I hope we capitalise on Australias recent form, said Younis.

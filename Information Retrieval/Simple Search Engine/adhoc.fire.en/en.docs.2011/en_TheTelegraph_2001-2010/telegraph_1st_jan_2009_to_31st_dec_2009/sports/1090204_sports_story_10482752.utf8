                  Indian cricketers celebrate after their victory against Sri Lanka at the R. Premadasa Stadium on Tuesday. (Reuters)                     
	Colombo: Yuvraj Singh and Virender Sehwag cracked blistering centuries as a ruthless India clinched the five-match cricket series against Sri Lanka by spanking the hosts by 147 runs in the third ODI here Tuesday.         
	Electing to bat first, India rode on a 221-run stand for the third wicket between Sehwag (116) and Yuvraj (117) to amass 363 for five, their highest score in Sri Lanka.         
	Chasing the mammoth total, Sri Lanka folded for 216 in 41.4 overs, despite Kumar Sangakkaras defiant 83 off 82 balls. Left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha caused the maximum damage to Sri Lanka, claiming four for 38.         
	India thus took an unassailable 3-0 lead in the series and both the teams will square off again here on Thursday for the fourth match.         
	The capacity crowd at the R. Premadasa Stadium found the only consolation when off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan removed Yuvraj to equal Wasim Akrams world record tally of 502 ODI scalps.         
	This was Indias highest total on Lankan soil, eclipsing the previous best of 307 for 6 in 1998 at the same venue.         
	Chasing such a total, Sri Lanka desperately needed a big knock from Sanath Jayasuriya, but the veteran opener let the side down Tuesday.         
	Jayasuriya dragged the first ball he faced, from Praveen Kumar, onto the stumps and that was clearly a bad omen for the hosts.         
	Tillekeratne Dilshan (30 off 26 balls) sizzled for a while in Sangakkaras company before an inside edge off Zaheer Khan upset his timbers.         
	Like Dilshan, Mahela Jayawardene (30) also got the start but with the run rate mounting, the Lankan captain had no other option but to try something different.         
	He came dancing down the track for a big hit off Praveen only to find Sehwag at mid-off.         
	Sehwag then removed Thilina Kandamby (10) and, in the next over, Pragyan Ojha cleaned up Chamara Kapugedera (2) to tighten the noose around the hosts.         
	Sangakkara did try his best but by then, it was too late and the Lankan tail simply didnt have it in them to accomplish such the Herculean task.                     
	Earlier, Sehwag and Yuvraj set the stadium ablaze with some scintillating stroke-play as the duo stitched a record 221 runs for the third wicket.         
	Yusuf Pathan (59 not out) and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (35 not out) were the other notable contributors for the visitors.         
	The twin centuries also broke a jinx as no Indian batsman had hit an ODI century in Lanka in the last 10 years.         
	The Indians, however, had a rather poor start to their innings when Sachin Tendulkar (7) was handed a dubious leg before wicket decision for the third successive time.         
	Dilhara Fernandos delivery was going down the leg but umpire Gamini Silva felt otherwise and upheld the Lankan appeal.         
	Fifteen runs later, Sehwags straight drive brushed bowler Fernandos fingers before hitting the stumps with Gautam Gambhir (10) backing up too far.         
	Sehwag and Yuvraj brought the smiles back in the dressing room with an audacious exhibition of strokes that put the islanders on the back foot.         
	Yuvrajs 95-ball 117 contained 17 boundaries and a six while Sehwag was equally ruthless in his 90-ball 116 which was studded with 17 boundaries.         
	The Punjab southpaw was adjudged Man of the Match.         
	Yusuf Pathan and Dhoni then provided the late sparks by using the long handle to devastating effect in the slog overs.         
	Sehwag and Yuvraj maintained a brisk scoring rate of over seven runs per over right through their partnership.         
	The Sri Lankan bowlers looked clueless against the rampaging duo.         
	While the pacemen strayed down the leg side and bled runs, the two spinners  Muralidharan and Ajantha Mendis  also failed to contain the run flow.         
	To make matters worse, Jayasuriya dropped Sehwag when the batsman was on 73 and the lapse proved costly.         
	You cant give such batsmen such reprieves. It took Yuvraj only 82 balls to score his 11th one-day century. It took Sehwag seven deliveries less. By then, they were dismissing the bowling at will.         
	It didnt matter whether it was Murali or Mendis, or Fernando. The ball kept disappearing over the infield or into the gaps, and some appalling fielding, epitomised by Mendis letting one through his legs, merely increased Mahela Jayawardenes angst.         
	Not that Sri Lanka made their own luck either. Farveez Maharoof didnt sight the ball when Yuvraj miscued Ajantha Mendis over midwicket, and Dilhara Fernando palmed a tough chance over the rope when Sehwag, then on 45, lifted the same bowler over wide long-on.         
	Sanath Jayasuriya was the next culprit, grassing a routine caught-and-bowled chance with Sehwag on 72.         
	Yuvrajs innings finally came to an end when he was caught by Jayawardene off Muralidharan.         
	Sehwag soon joined him in the pavilion being run out off a direct hit from Jayasuriya.         
	But with Pathan and Dhoni milking runs at will, there was no respite for the hosts.                 (PTI)

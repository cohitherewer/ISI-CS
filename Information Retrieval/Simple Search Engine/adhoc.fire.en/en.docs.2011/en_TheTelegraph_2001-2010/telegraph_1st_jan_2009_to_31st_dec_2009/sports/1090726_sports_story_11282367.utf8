The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Legalise tampering, says Donald
                                                   Legalise tampering, says Donald
                      
	Durban: Former South Africa speedster Allan Donald feels the International Cricket Council (ICC) should legalise ball tampering to prevent the growing hegemony of batsmen in world cricket.         
	The ICC would shoot me for saying it, but with the wickets that we play on and the dying breed fast bowlers are becoming on these flat wickets, I would say we do need some sort of defence mechanism, something to fall back on to say Right, we can do this. We can now prepare this ball to go, Donald told a cricket website.         
	However, the 42-year-old, currently the coach of Warwickshire where he had served with distinction as a player, is aware his plea would have very little effect. That (legalising ball-tampering) quite simply would never happen, he said.         
	Ball tampering raised quite a storm during Donalds playing days and the pacer conceded that bowlers did it to get reverse swing. There is no doubt guys tampered with the ball, he said of the fast bowlers of his time.         
	England also used reverse swing to win back the Ashes at home in 2005. Yes, I remember (Andrew) Flintoff and (Simon) Jones do it beautifully to swing it both ways especially in Old Trafford by chucking the ball into the foothold, he said.         
	Donald is not the first one to champion the cause of ball tampering. In the mid-1990s, Sir Richard Hadlee, too, had advocated legalising ball tampering.         
	As long as the bowlers or fielders use whatever means they have on their persons, I dont see anything wrong with it. Im talking about the use of a finger nail to scratch the ball, not bottle tops or those sorts of things, Hadlee had written in a newspaper column at that time.         
	Talking about reverse swing, Donald said the best method was to let the ball rip without artificial help.         
	I wouldnt bite it, he said. One way is if the ball gets scuffed on one side, and there is a tiny little chunk that is missing, you pick it up and just keep that side dry and keep working on it, while shining the other side very heavily without putting any moisture.         
	The whole team needs to keep track of this and should know the ball is reversing and they need to shine one side. The bowler, because he is bowling, should keep his wet hands on this side while keeping the other side dry. Thats all you need, he explained.         
	One (popular) way to do it is to get the ball into the dirt. Even the red ball, in places like India, we found, did not take too long to reverse.         
	There was no immediate reaction available but it sure will stir a hornets nest. (agencies)

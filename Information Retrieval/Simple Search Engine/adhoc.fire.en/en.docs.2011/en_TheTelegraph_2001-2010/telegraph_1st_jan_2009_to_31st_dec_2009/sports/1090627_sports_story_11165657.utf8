The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CA wants players to reduce sledging
                                                   CA wants players to reduce sledging
            Giles Mole                             
	London: Australia, for so long considered the masters of sledging, have been told to cut it out by Cricket Australia chiefs as they bid for Ashes glory this summer.         
	The likes of Steve Waugh, Merv Hughes, Glen McGrath and Shane Warne were as renowned for their ability to get under the skin of opponents mentally as they were for their exploits with bat or ball. Mental disintegration is what Waugh called it, and it certainly worked, with Australia the dominant force in world cricket for the last decade.         
	However, Australian fans have clearly developed a distaste for such on-field intimidation and as such, CA chiefs have produced guidelines, sent privately to each contracted player, for them to follow.         
	As a result of a survey, the players have been told that fans want them to:         
	Be competitive without splaying visible aggression or sledging; be enthusiastic, optimistic and upbeat and avoid being too disappointed, despondent or abrupt with the media; avoid spitting and swearing; dont claim dropped catches.         
	The Aussie players have also been told that, while they are still considered better role models by the public than rugby players of either code, leading Aussie Rules footballers are rapidly closing the gap. And with sponsors keen to ensure their image is not tarnished by the actions of those they are funding, Cricket Australia has moved quickly to ensure that fair play is paramount and that the wishes of the fans are adhered to.         
	A letter from CA to the squad said: The public say they will stay away from sports they dont believe are good role models  and so do sponsors.         
	England captain Andrew Strauss is used to hearing Australia counterpart Ricky Ponting announce the opening batsman will be targeted during any forthcoming Ashes series.         
	But when asked at a news conference if England intended to target Ponting, Strauss tried to turn the tables on the Tasmanian by pointing out that his rival captain had yet to lead Australia to a Test series win in England.         
	Ricky Ponting is a class player, said Strauss, who made two centuries during Englands 2-1 home Ashes series win in 2005.         
	Im sure he is dying to win a series in England. He failed last time. Whether that puts him under more pressure or not, thats for him to tell you.         
	They dont have those legends they had, but the guys that have come in have done a good job, and they will be determined to make their own mark in Australian cricket, Strauss said.         
	Five classic Ashes sledges:         
	Move out the way, Gatt. I cant see the stumps  Dennis Lillee addressing rotund England batsman Mike Gatting.         
	No good hitting me there, mate, theres nothing to damage  Derek Randall to Dennis Lillee after being hit on the head by a bouncer.         
	Can I borrow your brain? Im building an idiot  An Aussie fan to England spinner Phil Tufnell.         
	Ill bowl you a f*****g piano, you Pommie poof. Lets see if you can play that  Merv Hughes to England batsman Mike Atherton.         
	Mate, if you just turn the bat over, youll find the instructions on the other side  Merv Hughes to every England batsman who ever faced his bowling.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	London: England bolstered their bowling options by naming Ryan Sidebottom in a 14-man squad for the fourth Ashes Test against Australia starting Friday at Headingley.         
	England also included uncapped Warwickshire batsman Jonathan Trott in the squad for the match. Monty Panesar was left out.         
	Harmison could replace Andrew Flintoff should the Lancashire all-rounders knee injury rule him out.

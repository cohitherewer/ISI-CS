The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We can match best in Asia: Bhaichung 
                                                   We can match best in Asia: Bhaichung 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Bhaichung Bhutia on Sunday backed his team to match the best in Asian football.         
	At the end of an inspiring performance against Kyrgyzstan, the India captain said: We combined well in all areas. We have our strong points. Please dont expect us to play like Brazil or FC Barcelona. That will not happen. But today this team can match Korea and Japan. We are not an easy team to beat now.         
	Bhaichung said the present Indian team was a very good side. It is important to play such oppositions because we get to know our true standard. You learn nothing if you play strong teams and lose by six-seven goals. We have to go step by step.         
	Bhaichung, who dedicated his goal in the 100th outing to his teammates, said: You must not forget the support staff. They have been doing a wonderful job.         
	When asked how he tackled pressure, Bhutia said: I was under pressure today. It was a must-win situation but sometimes the pressure can be good. It brings out the best in you. We kept the ball moving forward.         
	On the remaining two matches, Bhutia confidently said: The tournament is still open. We dont have to worry about other teams. We have to win our matches.         
	Both Bhutia and Bob Houghton praised goalkeeper Subrata Paul for his brave show under the bar that included a crucial penalty save two minutes after India took a 2-0 lead.         
	Bhutia said: Subrata was outstanding. That penalty save was very crucial. I have always felt he has tremendous anticipation and he showed it well in this match.         
	Subrata is the best goalkeeper in the country. He proved it in AFC and was wonderful tonight, said Houghton.         
	The national coach has been saying it from the last season after East Bengal sidelined Paul for unsatisfactory performance.         
	Houghton was very pleased with the Indian showing though he felt the defence got slower in the last 20 minutes.

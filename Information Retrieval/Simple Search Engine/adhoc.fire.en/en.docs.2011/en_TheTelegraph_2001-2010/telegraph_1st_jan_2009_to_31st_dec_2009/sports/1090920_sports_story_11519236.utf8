The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arsenal outclass Wigan
                                                   Arsenal outclass Wigan
                      
	London: Fernando Torres rode to Liverpools rescue with a late winner Saturday at West Ham as the visitors clung on to win 3-2 having twice conceded the lead. But the match of the day was played at the Emirates where Arsenal bounced back from two successive Premier League defeats in emphatic style by thrashing Wigan Athletic 4-0.         
	Arsenal outclassed Wigan with two goals from centre back Thomas Vermaelen and one each by Emmanuel Eboue and Cesc Fabregas.         
	Torres made the decisive connection with Ryan Babels cross for his second goal of the match in the 75th minute on a nervy night for the Reds when their defensive frailties were badly exposed.         
	Torres had put Liverpool in front in the 20th, but it was soon canceled out by Alessandro Diamantis penalty.         
	Dirk Kuyt restored Liverpools lead in the 41st, but it lasted just minutes before Carlton Cole leveled again.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tamim Iqbal props up Bangladesh
                                                   Tamim Iqbal props up Bangladesh
                      
	Kingstown: An unbeaten 66 from Tamim Iqbal allowed Bangladesh to make steady progress and reach 109 for one in their second innings at lunch in the opening Test against the West Indies on Sunday.         
	Bangladesh continued from their overnight total of 26 without loss on the fourth day of the Test at the Arnos Vale Sports Complex.         
	At the interval, Tamim, who had struck eight fours from 137 balls in just over three hours of batting, and Junaid Siddique (14) were at the crease.         
	Tamim reached his 50 from 72 balls, when he turned a delivery from Darren Sammy to mid-wicket for a single.         
	He was watchful, doing away with his usual adventurous self.         
	Tino Best did try to unsettle the left-handed opener with some bouncers, but Tamim swayed away on most occasions.         
	Fortune favoured Tamim though, when the West Indies captain Floyd Reifer dropped him on 30 at first slip in Sammys fourth over.         
	Having started their second innings with a deficit of 69, Bangladesh formally took the lead when off-spinner Ryan Austin delivered a no-ball in his sixth over, as Tamim and fellow opener Imrul Kayes put on 82 for the first wicket.         
	But Imrul was caught at extra cover, driving at a flighted ball from Austin, about an hour before the interval.         
	After his dismissal, Siddique joined Tamim, and they batted the remainder of the session to solidify Bangladeshs position.         
	On Saturday, opener Omar Phillips fell six short of a century on debut but helped the West Indies to a first-innings lead of 69.         
	The 22-year-old Phillips struck seven fours in 94 as the home team, in reply to Bangladeshs first innings total of 238, made 307.         
	All-rounders Dave Bernard (53) and Darren Sammy (48) supported well in the middle order.         
	Off-spinner Mahmudullah (3/59) and fast bowler Rubel Hossain (3/76), both on debut, were the impressive for the visitors.         
	Stand-in skipper Shakib-al Hasan picked up two for 76.           (AFP)

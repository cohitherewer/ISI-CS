The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pietersen doubtful 
                                                   Pietersen doubtful 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	London: Kevin Pietersen awaited a doctors verdict on his problematic Achilles tendon on Monday. The injury has clearly been a factor in the second Ashes Test, limiting his stroke play and restricting his fielding, and if there is no improvement before the third Test it is hard to see him being fit enough to play.         
	Pietersen has already had a homeopathic injection and a cortisone injection in the tendon. The next one will be a saline solution with a small percentage of cortisone, which is intended to cushion the movement of the tendon within its sheath.

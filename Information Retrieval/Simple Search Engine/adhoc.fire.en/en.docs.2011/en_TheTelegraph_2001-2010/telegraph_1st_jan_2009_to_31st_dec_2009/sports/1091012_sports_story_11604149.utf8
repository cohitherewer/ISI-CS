The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | RCB, Volts in do-or-die match
                                                   RCB, Volts in do-or-die match
                      
	Bangalore: Both smarting from their defeats at the hands of the Cape Cobras in their tournament openers, local favourites Royal Challengers Bangalore and New Zealands Otago Volts would be desperate to put their campaigns back on track when they meet here Monday, in the Champions League.         
	It is basically a knockout match between Anil Kumbles Royal Challengers and Craig Cummings Volts as they have lost their first matches. The Royal Challengers lost to the Cobras despite a good batting performance. A mixture of poor bowling and JP Duminys batting pyrotechnics that did them in.         
	Robin Uthappa and Ross Taylor have shown they are in good nick and any batting order that includes the likes of Rahul Dravid, Virat Kohli, Jacques Kallis and Mark Boucher is bound to give their opponents sleepless nights. But for the Bangalore side, bowling remains a worry, and their inability to defend a 180-run target against the Cobras exposed their weakness.         
	Praveen Kumar was among the wickets but could not stem the run flow, while Vinay Kumar, Roelof van der Merwe and Kumble looked clueless against Duminy.         
	The runners-up of the Indian Premier League might still prevail over their opponents Monday, since Otagos was a worse performance against the Cobras.         
	Despite having internationals like the McCullum brothers  Brendon and Nathan  Aaron Redmond and Neil Broom, apart from English all-rounder Dimitri Mascarenhas, there is a certain brittle look about the top order.         
	In the other match of the day, Somerset Sabres will take on Trinidad and Tobago, the team who add a Caribbean flavour to this tournament. Led by Daren Ganga, the Caribbeans have not yet played in the Champions League but boast of a fairly strong line-up that includes hard-hitting all-rounder Dwayne Bravo.         
	After pulling off a sensational last-ball win in their opening match, the Sabres will hope to maintain the momentum. (PTI)

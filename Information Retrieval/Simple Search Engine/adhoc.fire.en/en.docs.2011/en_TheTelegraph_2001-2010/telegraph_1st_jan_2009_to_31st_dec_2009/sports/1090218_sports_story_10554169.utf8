The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | McEnroe is 50 and still rocking
                                                     McEnroe is 50 and still rocking

	Isnt McEnroe supposed to be the man who is forever young, forever angry and forever dangerous? The enfant terrible of Wimbledons Centre Court is no longer an enfant of anything, and he isnt so terrible now either.         
	The Johnny Mac Birthday Debate is not so much whether McEnroe, who turned 50 Monday, is going to deal with being 50, but whether some of his followers will cope.         
	McEnroe reaching the big five-oh will doubtless force a few to look at their own advancing years, to wonder what they have done since Mac was telling officials that they were the pits of the world and one Czech opponent that he was a f***ing communist a**hole. The bad, mad young McEnroe hasnt been cryogenically frozen by the officials at the All England Club, ready to be defrosted every summer for the viewing pleasure of Londons chattering classes; he is, would you believe it, ageing like everyone else.         
	Have you noticed how some nostalgic McEnroe fans rarely, if ever, reminisce about the beautiful shots he played at his peak on the way to winning three Wimbledon titles and four US Open trophies, or about his rivalry with Bjorn Borg? Instead, they only recall McEnroes umpire-baiting glories of the 1980s. And those followers can still delight in his anger management issues.         
	There was something to savour a couple of months ago when, during the seniors Blackrock Masters at Londons Royal Albert Hall, McEnroe turned on a line-judge and said: You are a pathetic, fat, ugly loser. How low a life do you have?         
	Is turning 50 going to make McEnroe a softer, gentler soul? There is little doubt that he has already calmed down. I was always fighting the tennis establishment, trying to run through brick walls, McEnroe has said. I dont have the angst I had.         
	The 50-year-old McEnroe appears to be content off the court. After a first marriage and divorce to the troubled actress Tatum ONeal, he is now happily married to Patty, my soul mate and my partner in crime.         
	McEnroe doesnt do forced reinvention. He has changed from being an angry young man to a 50-year-old who generally appears to have his dark thoughts under control. McEnroe has grown up. Sort of.         
	In the 1980s, McEnroe was a pantomime villain rather than a proper villain, as much of the outrage at his behaviour was only mock outrage. McEnroe was more popular than the moral guardians of the time would have known or would have liked. And when McEnroe retired from the main Tour, and became a television commentator, he showed a different side to his personality.         
	McEnroe brings a touch of self-referencing irony to his broadcasting work for British and American networks. He is the best commentator at Wimbledon every summer. What else is there to Johnny Mac these days? McEnroe has a bit of the frustrated musician in him, playing Led Zeppelin covers with his band at the weekend. John McEnroe, still rocking at 50.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

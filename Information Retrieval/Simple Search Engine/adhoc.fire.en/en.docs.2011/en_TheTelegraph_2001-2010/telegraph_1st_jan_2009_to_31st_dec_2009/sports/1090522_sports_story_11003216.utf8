                                                   Easy win for the DareDevils
                      
	Pretoria: Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir marked their return to form with blistering knocks as the Delhi DareDevils prepared for the IPL semi-finals with a comfortable four-wicket victory over the Mumbai Indians in their last league match here Thursday.         
	After restricting the Mumbai Indians to 165 for eight, Sehwag cracked a 27-ball 50 while Gambhir blasted 47 off 38 balls to guide their team to victory at the SuperSport Park. The DareDevils, who had already assured themselves of a berth in the semi-finals, could have won with a bigger margin had they not lost four wickets in quick succession to make it a little tight in the end.         
	Chasing 166 to win, Delhi had a rollicking start with opener David Warner (15) and Gambhir clobbering the pacers all over the park. However, Warner was sent packing by Dhawal Kulkarni when he mis-hit a rising delivery to Ashraful.         
	Captain Virender Sehwag then joined Gambhir in the middle and the duo recreated their old magic by stitching together a 68-run partnership for the second wicket to help the DareDevils reach 50 in just 5.2 overs and then reach 104 in 11 overs.         
	Sehwag found his form back and punished the bowlers with disdain. Kulkarni was at the receiving end in the sixth over when he dispatched the lanky pacer three times across the boundary to accumulate 14 runs. In the 10th over, Sehwag picked up his first six off Abhishek Nayar and followed it up with two more fours to score 16 runs off the over. Gambhir, meanwhile, kept the scoreboard ticking before his mis-hit was caught by Ashraful.         
	After cruising to 104 for one, the DareDevils lost the wickets of Tillekaratne Dilshan (24) and Sehwag off successive deliveries. Two overs later, in-form AB De Villiers (6) and Rajat Bhatia (2) returned to the hut to reduce the Delhi side to 153 for six with Harbahjan Singh capturing all the four wickets But it was too late.

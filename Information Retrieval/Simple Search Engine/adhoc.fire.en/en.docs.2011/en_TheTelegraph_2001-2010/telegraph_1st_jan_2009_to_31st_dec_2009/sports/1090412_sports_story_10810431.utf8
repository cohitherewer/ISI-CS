The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harbhajan keen to do well
                                                   Harbhajan keen to do well
                      
	New Delhi: Last years slapping row with Sreesanth and the subsequent ban firmly behind him, feisty Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh says he is focussed on making an impact in the Indian Premier League (IPL)s second edition.         
	I missed the greater part of IPL last year because of reasons well known. But Im looking forward to come back and it should be nice to play against Andrew Symonds, Matthew Hayden and all the big guys, said Harbhajan, who was banned from inaugural IPL season after playing only three matches for Mumbai Indians for slapping Sreesanth.The Punjab off-spinner, who was in good form during Indias just-concluded tour of New Zealand scalping 16 wickets, said the main reason Team India have been doing well is that the players are no more insecure about their place in the side.

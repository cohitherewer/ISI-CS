                                                   Security cover for cricket manager
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: It was a perfect day-after on Thursday. Twenty-four hours after Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) cricket manager John Buchanan decided to go for more than one captain, thereby clipping Sourav Gangulys wings, the city found a new villain in one of international crickets most successful coaches. Such was the level of the protests that the police were forced to review the Australians security.         
	Effigies of the Australian were burnt in front of Eden Gardens  where the KKR squad is practising  placards saying John Bukanan (sic) go back were waved. It was a throw back to those days when Greg Chappell was the India coach and Calcutta disliked anything and everything from Down Under. Even the state urban development minister Ashok Bhattacharya, known to be very close to the former India captain, chipped in, backing Bengals favourite son and ridiculing the multiple skipper concept.         
	The growing discontentment among aficionados over Buchanans outrageous idea, had its ripples felt at Lalbazar. Late Thursday, the Calcutta Police reviewed Buchanans security and, later, decided to offer him protection with plainclothes men shadowing him round the clock, even inside the Eden.         
	We have decided to provide security to Buchanan. He would be covered everywhere, as and when required, by a team of officers, said Gautam Chakrabarti, the commissioner of police.         
	It has been decided a team of officers from the special branch, trained in providing VIP security, would form a ring around the Australian coach and shadow him. The security aspect, however, would be reviewed from time to time.

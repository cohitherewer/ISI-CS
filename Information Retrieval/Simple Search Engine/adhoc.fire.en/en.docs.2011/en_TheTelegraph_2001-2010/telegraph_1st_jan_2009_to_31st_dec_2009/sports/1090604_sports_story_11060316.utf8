                                                   Hockey India sees the light of day
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) on Wednesday announced the formation of Hockey India amid suspicion that the body could be used by a section of the officials as a tool to grab power.         
	Addressing a news conference, the IOA president, Suresh Kalmadi said that Hockey India, a unified body for the mens and the womens associations, had to be formed after the International Hockey Federation (FIH) set a 15 day deadline on May 5.         
	The FIH said it would withdraw the World Cup from India unless we formed Hockey India within a fortnight, Kalmadi said. So, we registered the body on May 20, 2009 after a nine-member IOA committee approved the formation.         
	IOA treasurer A.K. Mattoo has been named the president of the newly-formed body while Aslam Khan, a member of the ad hoc committee, which now stands dissolved, will be the secretary general.         
	While several state associations alleged that IOA was trying to sideline the traditional power lobby, Kalmadi said the election for Hockey India would be held in the next six months.         
	Interestingly, the IOA chief said that the current body will have the power to scrutinise the working of the state associations. The present set of office bearers will assess the performance of the state units and see whether they hold elections and meeting as per the rules, Kalmadi said.         
	Sources in the IOA claimed Hockey India has been given wide ranging powers to even cancel the affiliations of the state units, both in the mens and womens sections, unless they comply with Hockey India directives.

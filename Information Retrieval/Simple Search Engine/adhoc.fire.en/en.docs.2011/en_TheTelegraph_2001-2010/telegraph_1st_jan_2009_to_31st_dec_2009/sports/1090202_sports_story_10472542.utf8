                                                   Double blow to Pakistan 
  - Champions Trophy moved out of strife-torn country; ICC leaves ICL fate in BCCI hands         A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: It was a double blow to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Sunday as the International Cricket Council (ICC) withdrew the hosting rights of the Champions Trophy from the country and re-awarded the infamous 2006 Oval Test to England.         
	The Test match was originally deemed forfeited by Pakistan, but declared a draw by the ICC last year.         
	The world governing body for the game, after its two-day board meeting in Perth, said conditions were unsuitable for hosting the prestigious event in the trouble-torn country, but Pakistan would still receive hosting revenue.         
	The new venue will be decided before the next ICC board meeting in April.         
	The Champions Trophy had been postponed from 2008 to September of this year due to security concerns voiced by several teams.         
	The Oval Test became the first forfeiture in the history of Test cricket after controversial Australian umpire Darrell Hair and his West Indian colleague Billy Doctrove awarded it to England on the fourth day.         
	The umpires move was prompted by Pakistans refusal to take the field after Hair had accused them of ball tampering and penalised them by docking five runs from their total, a decision that had infuriated the then Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul Haq.         
	After reconsideration of the matter, which included consideration of legal advice and input from the MCC, the custodians of the laws of cricket, the board decided that the original umpires decision to award the match to England, should apply, the ICC said.         
	In another move, the ICC virtually authorised the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to decide on the Indian Cricket Leagues plea for official recognition, saying member countries would determine if a match or tournament within their territory was approved or disapproved.         
	Incidentally, the BCCI had earlier banned all players and officials associated with the ICL. So their stance in this case is obvious.         
	It was agreed that a host member could determine if a match or tournament within its territory was approved or disapproved.         
	The ICC would also be given power to make such a determination in a non-member territory, an ICC statement said.         
	It was also agreed that no members, members players, coaches or match officials could participate in disapproved cricket, the statement added.         
	It was agreed that no foreign player could take part in domestic cricket unless he obtained a no-objection certificate (NOC) from his home board.         
	ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said Indias cancellation of its teams proposed tour to Pakistan carried weight to other member boards which had earlier shown reluctance in playing in Pakistan due to security concerns.         
	The (ICC) board accepted that, with several members expressing reservations about touring Pakistan, it would be prudent to relocate the event, scheduled for September-October, from that country, the ICC said.         
	In view of the challenges facing the PCB which are out of its control, the (ICC) board agreed that, irrespective of the location of the event, Pakistan would retain the revenue due for hosting the tournament, it added.         
	The alternate nominee is Sri Lanka. There are just a few things we want to iron out before we confirm that particular as the alternate host, Lorgat added.         
	Pakistan went through 2008 without playing a Test match as teams refused to tour the country, citing security fears.         
	The ICC board also offered to form a task team to visit Pakistan and work with the PCB to find ways to ensure that, wherever possible, international cricket is played in the country in the future.         
	The ICC board also decided that the 2010 World Twenty20 Championship would be held in the West Indies.

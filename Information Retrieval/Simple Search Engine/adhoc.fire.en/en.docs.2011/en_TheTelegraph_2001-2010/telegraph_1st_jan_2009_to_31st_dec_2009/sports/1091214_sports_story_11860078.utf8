The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A cakewalk for Vitali Klitschko
                                                                                                                       7                                        A cakewalk for Vitali Klitschko
          
	Berne: Vitali Klitschko easily retained his WBC world heavyweight title on Saturday, winning an unanimous points decision against American challenger Kevin Johnson.         
	The 38-year-old Ukrainian spent the entire fight on the offensive against previously unbeaten Johnson but could not find his customary knockout as his opponent opted for survival.         
	A sell-out 17,000 crowd at Bernes PostFinance Arena willed the 38-year-old Klitschko to finish the job inside the distance, as he had done in 37 of his previous 38 victories from 40 fights, but Johnsons chin was up to the task, even though he rarely landed a meaningful punch.         
	He was a very unusual fighter, Klitschko said at ringside after his fourth win since returning to action in 2008 following an injury-induced retirement in 2005.         
	He moved very well and was not easy to hit. Im disappointed because I would have preferred a knockout but Im happy that I won all 12 rounds.         
	Johnsons chief tactic appeared to be to irritate the champion, gesticulating throughout the fight and pointing to his chin and tempers flared briefly at the end of the 11th when the fighters traded punches after the bell.         
	Vladimir Klitschko, Vitalis younger brother and holder of the WBO, IBO and IBF, also became involved in a brief exchange with Johnson after the final bell at the end of the 12th.         
	Klitschko said he hoped to take on Briton David Haye, who beat Russian giant Nikolai Valuev last month to win the WBA belt, in a unification fight next year.         
	Haye was supposed to have fought Vladimir earlier this year for his titles, but pulled out injured before outclassing Valuev over 12 rounds in Germany.         
	The 38-year-old Vitali had too much strength for Johnson, who spent much of the fight on the ropes and could never make any real impression.         
	Im ready, Klitschko said.         
	I will be happy to fight him next year. David Haye is the trash talking world champion.         
	Hayes trainer Adam Booth is confident his charge can beat the WBC champion if the match is made. (REUTERS)

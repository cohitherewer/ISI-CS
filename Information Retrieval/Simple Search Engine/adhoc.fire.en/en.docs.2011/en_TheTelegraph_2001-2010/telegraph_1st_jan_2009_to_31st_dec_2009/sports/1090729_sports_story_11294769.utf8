The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians are awe-struck by Zlatan
                                                   Indians are awe-struck by Zlatan
                      
	New Delhi: Indian footballers training in Barcelona took time out on Monday to witness Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovics introduction to the FC Barcelona supporters at Nou Camp.         
	Some Indian players attended the ceremony where 50,000 fans were present.         
	I have never seen such a spectacle in my life. It was awe-inspiring to witness the passion for football among the people here, India defender Gouramangi Singh said. They (the fans) were roaring madly. Imagine what would have been the effect when Ronaldo and Kaka were introduced in Real Madrid.         
	He said the team is concentrating on the second friendly against Spanish third division side Assiciacio Esportiva El Prat, to be played on Wednesday. Well be in a better shape and form in the second friendly, he said. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL in SA will be fun: Kevin
                                                   IPL in SA will be fun: Kevin
                      
	Kevin Pietersen, who has been bought by Royal Challengers Bangalore for a whopping $1.55 million, on Wednesday backed South Africa as the choice for the second edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) and hoped the Twenty20 extravaganza will be highly popular in the rainbow nation. Pietersen felt the good weather and hard pitches would add to the attraction of the tournament.               
	The following are excerpts         
	JP Duminy (player, Mumbai Indians): I was kind of looking forward to experiencing the atmosphere of the Indian crowds, but I am excited the tournament will be in South Africa.         
	Pietersen (player, Royal Challengers Bangalore): The weather will be good, the pitches will be hard and there should be some exciting cricket with some really big scores, which is what T20 is all about. England would have been a great host for the tournament as well, but now theyve made the decision to go to South Africa I think everybody will get behind it and turn it into another massive event. It will be great fun.         
	Shaun Pollock (mentor-cum-adviser, Mumbai Indians): Durban is the only city in the country with the warm weather to make it feasible to hold matches that deep into winter. Our fans may struggle initially to identify with teams. In that respect, it would have been better to have franchises based in particular cities.         
	Graeme Smith (player, Rajasthan Royals): I was in India last year and I saw how the tournament captured the peoples imagination. They loved watching players who were traditional rivals play alongside each other. What also amazed me was when I returned, how many South Africans had watched the tournament on television and the associations they had made with the respective teams.         
	Dale Steyn (player, Bangalore Royal Challengers): Imagine what this will do for the youngsters of my country. When I was growing up, there were no World Cups in South Africa. I was excited just by the opportunity to watch Jonty Rhodes diving all over the place on television. Now the kids of South Africa have a chance to go down to their local grounds and watch the best players in the world playing each other.         
	Shane Watson (player, Rajasthan Royals): Its extremely sad the IPL wont be held in India. It is a beautiful country and the people there are absolutely fanatical about cricket. But its still going to be an amazing tournament as it was last year. The IPLs again come at the right time of my career to get back on the track.

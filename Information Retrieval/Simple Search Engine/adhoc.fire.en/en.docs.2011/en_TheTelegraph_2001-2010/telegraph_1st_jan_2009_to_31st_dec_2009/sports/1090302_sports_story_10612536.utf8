The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I-League is wide open 
                                                                                                                   I-League is wide open

	A few days back when I was in Delhi to attend the felicitation function for the 1956 Olympians, a lot of people from the media asked me to predict the team that would ultimately win the I-League. It was a difficult question and I told them that surely they would have to wait till the last round for the answer. At the same time, I asked them to be thankful to Subhas Bhowmick for turning the I-League into a truly multi-team race.        
	I have a strong feeling that the last East Bengal-Mohun Bagan match could prove to be the single most important factor in deciding the fate of the league. More than the slip on the league table, the 0-3 defeat is a kind of blow that Mohun Bagan may find hard to recover from.        
	Frankly, I wasnt surprised by the result. At the same time, I wasnt ready to accept that it was a comeback for the red and gold brigade. Statistics have little role to play in a football match, especially in an East Bengal-Mohun Bagan encounter. It was foolish on the part of some to call Mohun Bagan the favourites just because they had won the past few meetings between the two teams.        
	I am not indicating that Bagan wont be able to win the league, but the defeat against East Bengal would have made things difficult for them. I feel Sporting Clube de Goa are slightly better placed since they are back in the lead although Bagan have a match in hand.                   Nabi scored a brace in East Bengal rsquo;s 3-0 win over Mohun Bagan      
	I dont foresee East Bengal winning the league, though they can still play the spoilsport. More than anything else, I am eagerly looking forward to two matches next month  Sporting Clube versus East Bengal on March 15 followed by the Churchill Brothers versus East Bengal match a week later. Victory for East Bengal in these two matches could turn the table in favour of Bagan.        
	These days I dont attach much importance to the results of the Calcutta derby as neither of the two teams is doing very well outside Calcutta. I would be more satisfied if East Bengal manage to beat Sporting or Churchill in the away matches or if Bagan can progress in the AFC Cup.        
	True, Bagan have won two titles this season. But they have won both  the Calcutta league and the Federation Cup  in their hometown. Their true strength will only be proved if they win the I-League.        
	According to my assessment, Churchill too stand a good chance of springing a surprise at the last moment mainly because of their striker Odafe Okolie. He seems to be in terrific form at the moment and is almost scoring at will. I watched him closely in a couple of matches and was able to spot a few flaws in his game. But somehow the defenders in the I-League are finding it difficult to contain him.                  
	More than the I-League, what is important for Indian football now is to do well on the international circuit. Without it the game cannot progress an inch in our country.         
	In the 50s and the 60s, the domestic football set up in India was not as strong as it is now and there was hardly any money. Yet, the tournaments all over the country used to be played to packed stands. Indias good showing at the Asian level was the reason why spectators were interested in domestic football.         
	The real test for Indian football will come after the I-League when the national team starts preparing for the Nehru Cup and the SAFF Cup. Then only will we know how much these players have progressed.

	Miami: Fourth seeds Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy crashed out of the Sony Ericsson Open with a shocking straight-set defeat at the hands of the unseeded Czech-Slovak pair of Frantisek Cermak and Michal Mertinak in the mens doubles pre-quarters here.         
	The Indo-Czech combine went down 3-6, 3-6 in just over an hours contest.         
	In a match that was surprisingly lop-sided, the fourth seeds were left to rue missed opportunities, frittering away three break points in the first set. Cermak and Mertinak broke Paes and Dlouhy twice in the first set. The second set followed almost a similar script. The unseeded duo broke Paes and Dlouhy twice again.         
	Rafael Nadal came from behind in both sets to beat Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-4) and reach the quarter finals in pursuit of his first Sony Ericsson Open title.         
	The top-ranked Nadal won despite converting only one of 12 break-point chances.         
	The two gruelling sets lasted 2 hours, 42 minutes before Nadal closed out the victory with a backhand crosscourt passing shot at 12:20 am local time.         
	His opponent in the quarter finals will be sixth-seeded Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina.         
	Second-seeded Roger Federer overcame eight break points in a remarkable sequence to take the lead for good and he beat American Taylor Dent 6-3, 6-2.         
	Federer will meet American Andy Roddick in the quarter finals.         
	Dents only break-point chances against Federer came in their 26-point fifth game. Federer double-faulted twice in the game and dumped several hurried shots into the net, which had him mumbling, then screaming.         
	Federer finally whacked a service winner to hold, and his game steadied after that. Dent played serve-and-volley and also charged the net behind some returns, but he won barely half his points at the net.         
	Fifth-seeded Roddick also left the baseline behind as he beat Frenchman Gael Monfils 7-6 (7-2), 6-4. Roddick won 22 points at the net, showing a willingness to move forward thats part of his more well-rounded game under his new coach, Larry Stefanki.         
	Other mens fourth-round winners were Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, del Potro, Fernando Verdasco and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Djokovic will play Tsonga in the first mens quarter final. Nadal will face del Potro, and Murray will play Verdasco.         
	Roddicks most recent match against Federer came in the Australian Open semi-finals in January. Federer won in straight sets.         
	In other mens fourth-round matches, Djokovic beat No. 21 Tomas Berdych 6-3, 6-2. Murray routed Viktor Troicki 6-1, 6-0. Tsonga won 6-7 (4-7), 6-3, 6-2 against No. 7 Gilles Simon, the highest-seeded man to be eliminated. Del Potro beat No. 11 David Ferrer of Spain 6-3, 6-2, and Verdasco defeated No. 18 Czech Radek Stepanek 6-2, 6-2.         
	Svetlana Kuznetsova outlasted 18-year-old Dane Caroline Wozniacki in the first womens quarter final, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-1.           (AP)

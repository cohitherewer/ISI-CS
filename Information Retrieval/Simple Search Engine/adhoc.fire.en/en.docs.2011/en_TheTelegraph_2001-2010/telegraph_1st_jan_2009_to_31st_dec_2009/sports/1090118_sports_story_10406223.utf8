                                                   Schedule irrational: Coach 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Indian marathoners are finding it hard to succeed as they are fighting against an abnormally tight schedule.         
	Beginning with the Allahabad event on November 19, five marathons have been scheduled in a gap of less than three months, the last to be hosted by Calcutta on February 8. While the organisation of so many international events is an encouraging sign, the schedule does not allow enough time for recovery.         
	The Federation (AFI) must restrict the number of events and rationalise the calendar, K.S. Matthew, the coach of the Indian marathoners participating at the Mumbai event, told The Telegraph on the eve of the marathon.         
	Matthew said the marathon scene in India was rebounding from a low in the early 2000s but there were not enough quality runners.         
	There is a shortage of standard athletes. Ideally you need a group of 20 runners (for a season) so that you could place four runners for each race. But I have only twelve at the moment, Matthew said.         
	When there are so many races in such a short period, I cannot allocate pace setters for the medallists, Matthew rued.         
	The Mumbai Marathon is the first international sporting event in the city since the 26/11 terror attacks. Nearly 35,000 have entered the event which has five race categories  full marathon (42.2 km), half marathon (21.09 km), wheelchair event (2.5 km), senior citizens run (4.3 km) and dream run (6 km).

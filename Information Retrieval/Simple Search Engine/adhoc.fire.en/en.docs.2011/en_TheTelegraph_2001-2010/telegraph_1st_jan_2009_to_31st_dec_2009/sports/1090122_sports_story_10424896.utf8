The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Case lodged against Modi
                                                   Case lodged against Modi
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The heat it seems is well and truly on the Rajasthan Cricket Associations (RCA) president, Lalit Modi, with Vasundhara Raje Scindia no more the states chief minister.         
	One learns that a member of the RCA, Anil Shekawat, has filed a case in one of the police stations of Jaipur, accusing Modi (also a vice-president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India) of misappropriation of Rs 22 lakh of the RCAs money.         
	The allegation, it appears, pertains to World Cup 2007 tickets bought by Modi for personal use and debited to the RCA.         
	When The Telegraph tried contacting Modi late on Wednesday, he did not answer his cell phone.         
	Details are awaited but the states new chief minister, Ashok Gehlot, is no friend of Modis and its to be seen how the investigation proceeds.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Special meeting today
                                                   Special meeting today
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) will discuss the special committee report, submitted on Tuesday, in detail during the special general meeting on Saturday.         
	The committee, chaired by former Justice Shyamal Sen, was appointed by the CAB to look into the huge expenditure during the inaugural edition of the IPL.         
	A decision on the course of action is expected to be taken at the meeting. However, the chances of recovering the excess expenditure seem remote at this point of time.         
	The CAB had earlier claimed the money from the BCCI. But the association is now considering withdrawing that claim.         
	It was learnt that the BCCI have assured the CAB that the Rs 10 crore, due to the association from the television rights, would be released if the CAB withdrew their claim.

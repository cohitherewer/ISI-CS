The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Randhawa up to tied eighth

	Shanghai: Jyoti Randhawa remained in hunt for a top five finish, carding a sedate two-under 70 to lie tied eighth after the midway stage of the $7,000,000 WGC-HSBC Champions golf tournament here on Friday.         
	Compatriots C. Muniyappa (69) rose to tied 37th at 143, two strokes ahead of Jeev Milkha Singh (72) who was tied 45th after the second round at Sheshan International Golf Club.         
	Gaganjeet Bhullar (150) was the lone Indian who could not improve his position and followed up his opening round 74 with 76 to slip to tied 70th.         
	World No. 1 Tiger Woods took his customary position atop the leaderboard, tying for the halfway lead with Nick Watney after shooting a second straight five-under 67.         
	The American world No. 1 endured a frustrating front nine but stormed home with four birdies to join overnight leader Watney (70) on 10-under 134.         
	Randhawa, a 10th tee starter, was even-par at the turn and he sunk three birdies, against one bogey, in his front nine to sign off with his second successive sub-par card.         
	It was a welcome return to form for the former Asia No. 1, who won the Singha Thailand Open earlier this year on the Asian Tour but failed to maintain his momentum.         
	Randhawa, however, felt there was enough room for improvement in the short game department and hoped his putting would improve over the next couple of days.         
	I need to putt better than this. The greens are tricky but guys are holing putts. Its a putting contest now. Whoever makes a lot of putts is going to win because the greens are very tricky, said the lanky golfer, who enjoyed a top-10 at the HSBC Champions in 2006.         
	But you know, Im well focused and whenever I got a chance I took advantage of that and that was a good point today, Randhawa said.         
	Muniyappa, also playing his back nine first, was one-over after his first six holes before he bounced back, firing four birdies over his next five holes to bring home the best card of the day by an Indian.         
	Jeev mixed five birdies with as many bogeys in his even-par second round, while Bhullar managed just one birdie as against five bogeys.         
	Woods has been runner-up twice at the HSBC Champions, and he put himself in contention again at Sheshan International. After consecutive holes of failing to make birdie with a wedge in his hand, he knocked in a 10-foot birdie on the ninth and was on his way.         
	I certainly had some looks and didnt really capitalise on anything, Woods said. Made a putt on 9 and from then on, I hit a lot of good putts and basically played the last 10 holes at 5 under.         
	He reached the par-5 18th in two for one last birdie to catch Watney (70) at 10-under 134.         
	They were one shot clear of Phil Mickelson, Ryan Moore (69) and Alvaro Quiros of Spain, who chose to lay up on the 18th instead of hitting 4-iron to the green because the putting surfaces were firm and quick. He had to settle for a par and a 66.         
	Another shot behind was Anthony Kim, who made eagle on the 18th for a 69, while yet another American, Pat Perez, made a bogey on his final hole for a 69 that put him at 7-under 137.

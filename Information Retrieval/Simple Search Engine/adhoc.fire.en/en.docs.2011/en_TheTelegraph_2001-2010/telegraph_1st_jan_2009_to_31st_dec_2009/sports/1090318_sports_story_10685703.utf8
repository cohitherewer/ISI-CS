The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | F1 title for winner of most races
                                                     F1 title for winner of most races
            Tom Cary              Hamilton                      
	The driver with the most race wins will be crowned Formula One world champion this season, the FIA has announced at a landmark meeting of the World Motor Sport Council (WMSC).         
	Under the system, the 2008 world title would have gone to Ferraris Felipe Massa rather than Lewis Hamilton as the Brazilian managed six race wins to the Britons five.         
	Hamilton, with 98 points, pipped Massa to the title by a single point last season.         
	As well as the change to the current scoring system, which will come into play from the season opening Grand Prix in Melbourne a week on Sunday, the FIA have made the dramatic announcement that there will be an optional budget cap of 30 million from 2010.         
	The cap would see some teams spending reduced by up to 90 per cent and encourage new entrants to enter the F1 arena.         
	It remains to be seen what the 10 current teams make of Tuesdays announcement.         
	FIA president Max Mosley confirmed that the 30 million budget cap would include drivers salaries.         
	When asked what was included, Mosley said: Everything except the motor home (if the team has one) and any fine(s) imposed by the FIA. All expenditure will be included, even the salaries of the drivers and team principal.         
	As a way of enticing teams to take up the option of the budget cap, the FIA has stated that it will tweak the regulations to ensure those with restricted finances will be just as competitive as those spending unlimited amounts of money.         
	A statement issued by the FIA said: The technical freedoms accorded to the low-budget teams will be adjusted from time to time to keep their median performance on a par with the median performance of the unlimited-expenditure teams. The regulations for the unlimited-expenditure teams will remain stable and fixed.         
	As far as 2009s new scoring system is concerned, it closely resembles the medals system for which Bernie Ecclestone was panned back in December.         
	The FIA rejected a proposal by the Formula One Teams Association to tweak the points system to 12-9-7-5-4-3-2-1 from first to eighth places.         
	The WMSC accepted the proposal from Formula One Management to award the drivers championship to the driver who has won the most races during the season, read an FIA statement.         
	If two or more drivers finish the season with the same number of wins, the title will be awarded to the driver with the most points, the allocation of points being based on the current 10, 8, 6 etc. system.         
	The rest of the standings, from second to last place, will be decided by the current points system. There is no provision to award medals for first, second or third place. The Constructors Championship is unaffected.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

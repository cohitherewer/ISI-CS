                                                   Sultan turns down offer
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The CABs rival faction have approached minister of state for tourism Sultan Ahmed in a desperate attempt to find a worthy candidate to field against reigning president Jagmohan Dalmiya in the upcoming CAB elections.         
	Sultan, however, has rejected the proposal saying he wouldnt be able to devote enough time to the job. I want a fresh face for the post. I have said no as I wont be able to devote the required time, he said.         
	Sultan, who also happens to be the president of Mohammedan Sporting, revealed that ex-Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee was also on the oppositions radar for the presidential post.         
	We wanted Somnath Chatterjee to contest the elections as he would have been a very good candidate. But nothing is decided yet and we will come up with something soon, Sultan told The Telegraph on Tuesday.         
	With the elections slated for later this month, the Maidan is abuzz with speculation as to the rival factions presidential candidate. Sourav Gangulys name has also been doing the rounds.

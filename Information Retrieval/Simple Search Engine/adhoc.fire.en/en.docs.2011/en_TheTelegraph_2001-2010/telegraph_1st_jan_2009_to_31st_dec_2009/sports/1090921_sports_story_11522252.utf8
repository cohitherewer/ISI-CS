The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Blues have it easy vs Spurs
                                                   Blues have it easy vs Spurs
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	London: Chelsea returned to the top of the Premier League Sunday with a 3-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur, who have lost two in a row after winning their first four and, in so doing, claimed a club record 11th straight victory, at Stamford Bridge.         
	After Ashley Cole had given Chelsea an early advantage, second half goals from Michael Ballack and Didier Drogba confirmed the victory.         
	Spurs were left to rue wasted first half opportunities, with Petr Cech saving from Jermain Defoe and Tom Huddlestone while the recalled Jermaine Jenas also went close.         
	Chelseas Jose Bosingwa struck the angle of right post and cross bar, from 20 yards, Frank Lampard headed wide and Nicolas Anelka found the side netting.         
	And the home side were unfortunate not to win a penalty when Spurs defender Vedran Corluka shoved Ballack.         
	But, seconds later, Drogba crossed from the right and Cole, slipping inside Corluka, stooped to head the 32nd minute opener.         
	In the 55th minute, Spurs manager Harry Redknapp was furious when referee Howard Webb refused to award a penalty when Robbie Keane fell under the weight of a challenge from Ricardo Carvalho.         
	And Spurs woe increased three minutes later when sloppy defending handed Chelsea a second goal.         
	Nicolas Anelka crossed from the right, Drogbas volley was only parried by former Chelsea goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini, and Lampard was allowed to pull the ball back from the byline, allowing Ballack to bundle it over the line under pressure from Sbastien Bassong.         
	Corluka was at fault for the third goal, in the 63rd minute. Coles long ball sent Drogba chasing and the striker robbed the Croat before stepping around Cudicini to finish in style for his 99th goal for Chelsea.         
	In the days other matches, Louis Saha scored twice as Everton beat Blackburn Rovers 3-0 and Wolverhampton Wanderers defeated Fulham 2-1.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clarke says no to IPL
                                                   Clarke says no to IPL
                      
	Melbourne/New Delhi: Australian vice-captain Michael Clarke Thursday announced his unavailability for the second edition of the Indian Premier League, citing a busy international calendar for the national team.         
	I wont be going to the IPL, Clarke was quoted as saying by the Australian Associated Press on the eve of the auction in Goa.         
	Clarke, who also missed the inaugural edition of the lucrative tournament, understood the IPL would be a good preparation for the World Twenty20 Championships, but said he wanted to utilise the time for a much-needed break from cricket.         
	The lead up to the Twenty20 World Championships is the IPL so its good preparation so it does not surprise me that a lot of players are going. (But) the most important thing for me is weve only got a couple of weeks off, weve got a very busy schedule. With me, with my body and time with my family, I want time off this year, he said.         
	Its a wonderful thing for cricket, its definitely improved Twenty20 cricket, its played a part in improving one-day cricket, he added. Clarke had attracted a reserve price of whopping $1 million in the list of 43 foreign players nominated by the eight franchises for Fridays auction.         
	IPL chairman and commissioner Lalit Modi said Clarkes last-minute withdrawal was due to his fear of remaining unsold. I dont think anybody is ready to pay that kind of price, Modi said. The reality is in front of him. He didnt want to be unsold in the auction and so decided to pull out, an upset Modi told a news channel.         
	He, however, said the IPL had this year waived off penalty for last moment pull out.

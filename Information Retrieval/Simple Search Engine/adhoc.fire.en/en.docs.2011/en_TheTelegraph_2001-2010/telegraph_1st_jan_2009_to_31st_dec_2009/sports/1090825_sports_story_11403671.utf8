The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hilditch owns up to errors
                                                   Hilditch owns up to errors
                      
	Adelaide: Australian selection committee chairman Andrew Hilditch conceded that they had misread the Oval pitch and made a blunder by ignoring off-spinner Nathan Hauritz for the Ashes decider.         
	We wouldve changed the side (from the fourth Test at Headingley) if wed read the wicket right, and we wouldve played Nathan Hauritz, Hilditch said.         
	Jamie Cox was the selector on duty, but everybody misread the wicket... our entire playing group, captain and coach included, and that just happens, Hilditch added.         
	However, he made it clear that the selectors could not be blamed for the debacle.         
	It would be an over-simplification to say that cost us the Test Thatd be incorrect. We lost the Test match because we got 160 in the first innings, Hilditch said.         
	However, he admitted it was difficult to digest the defeat. Im feeling gutted and have been in disbelief over the last couple of days. The traditional signs of whos going to win a Test series were all there and it should have been Australia.         
	We had six of the top-seven batsmen, 10 centuries, eight of them Australian, the three leading bowlers in the series were all Australian. Everything indicates that we dominated the Test series, Hilditch said.           (PTI)

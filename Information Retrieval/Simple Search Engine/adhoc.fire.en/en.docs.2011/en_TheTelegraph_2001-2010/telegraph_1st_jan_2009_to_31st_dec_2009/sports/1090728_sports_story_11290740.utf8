The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Johnson may be dropped
                                                     Johnson may be dropped
          
	Melbourne: Australian pacer Mitchell Johnsons recent poor form may cost him a place in the side for the third Ashes Test, starting in Birmingham, on Thursday.         
	Coach Tim Nielsen Monday hinted that Australia might not afford to play the left-arm fast bowler in the next match but also insisted the final decision will be taken only after assessing the conditions.         
	At the moment we are working hard to get him bowling as well as he possibly can, and we feel he is getting closer every time, so well have a look at the conditions when we get to Edgbaston and take it from there, Nielsen said.         
	The 27-year-old pacers poor form continued as he managed only one wicket giving away 107 runs in the three-day practice match against Northamptonshire that ended Sunday. (PTI)

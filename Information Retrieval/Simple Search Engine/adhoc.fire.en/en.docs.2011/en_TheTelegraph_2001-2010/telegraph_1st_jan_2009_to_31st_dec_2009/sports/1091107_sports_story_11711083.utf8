The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Not reading much into standings: Subrata
                                                                                                                                   Not reading much into standings: Subrata
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: They might have moved to the top of the I-League table, but Chirag United coach Subrata Bhattacharya chose to downplay the fact saying its nothing to create a hue and cry about.         
	Speaking after their 2-0 victory over Salgaocar Friday, Subrata said: We may be leading the standings at present, but I dont think we should ponder upon that too much. Its long league and Im not at all concerned about the current standings.         
	People neglected us at the beginning But in hindsight, I do feel that it has actually helped us to perform better, he said.         
	However, he added: But its feels nice that we have garnered 15 points after seven matches Its good to stay at a decent place in the table as basically its a junior team.         
	He also stressed on the fact that the victory will give the team a boost for the upcoming matches.         
	We will be playing Churchill Brothers and Dempo next So, its definitely going to be a boost before those tough matches.         
	Subratas counter Tim Hankinson was of the opinion that his side was guilty of throwing away the match. We played well in the first half, but lost it in the second. We killed ourselves None of the substitutions made any useful contribution and that cost us the match, the man from US said.

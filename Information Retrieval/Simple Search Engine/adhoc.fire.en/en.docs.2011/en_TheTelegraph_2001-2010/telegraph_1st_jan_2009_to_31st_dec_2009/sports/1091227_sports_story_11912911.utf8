	Guwahati: Defending champions Mohun Bagan entered the semi-final of the 31st Hero Honda Federation Cup beating Mahindra United 2-0 in their final group league encounter at the Nehru Stadium on Saturday.         
	Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto scored the first goal courtesy a spot-kick in the 41st minute, while Nigerian Edeh Chidi rounded off the tally in the 49th minute.         
	The green-and-maroon brigade squandered several opportunities and could have ended up winning by a bigger margin.         
	It was Mahindra stopper Dharamraj Ravanan who brought the Brazilian down in the penalty box and referee Dinesh Nair promptly awarded a penalty. Barreto made no mistake from the spot.         
	Bagan went on the offensive right from the start of the second session. It was Chidis predatory instincts that helped Bagan consolidate their lead. Left wing-back Biswajit Saha overlapped and sent a cross.         
	The ball fell in a goalmouth melee. Watching Mahindra custodian Subhashish Roy Chowdhury out of position, Chidi nicely tapped it in.         
	Down by two goals, the Mumbai outfit went all out during the last quarter of an hour and tried to make inroads into the Bagan territory.         
	Seasoned Bagan custodian Sangram Mukherjee was equal to the task as he fisted four attempts out of danger.         
	The win on Saturday helped the Calcutta giants top group B with seven points. They have two victories and a draw to their credit.         
	Mahindra finished second with six points. Bagan will now meet the group A winners in the second semi-final on Thursday.         
	On Sunday, in another do-or-die encounter, Shillong Lajong FC will take on Pune FC. Dempo will play Air india in the other match.

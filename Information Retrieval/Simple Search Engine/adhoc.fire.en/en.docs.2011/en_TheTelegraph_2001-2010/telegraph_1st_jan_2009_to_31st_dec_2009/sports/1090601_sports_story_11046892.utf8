                                                     We handle pressure better: Dhoni
                    The captains of the participating teams of the World Twenty20 with the trophy outside Guildhall in London on Sunday. (AP)                     
	London: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni Sunday said his men are more equipped than their counterparts to handle pressure situations associated with the shortest format of the game when they defend their ICC World Twenty20 title.         
	Dhoni said although other teams have players who featured in the IPL, his side have an upper hand in the biennial event starting here on June 5, as all the 15 members of the squad have featured in the just-concluded IPL in South Africa.         
	The best thing is that we know how to handle pressure better than others When you need 10 or 15 runs in the last over Everyone in our side has faced that situation. There are quite a few players from other countries (in the IPL) but most of our players were in the Indian Premier League, Dhoni told reporters at the official press conference here.         
	In IPL you have limited talent in your side, but here we have plenty of options. We have the cream of the IPL so there is less pressure on each and every individual, he added.         
	Dhoni, however, warned his teammates against complacency and said the defending champions cannot afford to take any side lightly.         
	In Twenty20, there is no such thing as a weak side, any individual can take the game away from you. We also cant live on or relish the memories We have to turn up and do everything from scratch again, its not about the past, Dhoni said pointing to their triumph in the inaugural World Twenty20 in South Africa two years back.         
	Cricket is a very cruel game The moment you relax, you mind find yourself in trouble, added Dhoni.         
	The India captain felt that having the same bunch of players in the team for the last few years has also helped his side. Ive got quite a few grey hairs. Thats one change, Dhoni joked when asked how the team had developed under him.         
	In the last three years there have been few changes in the side. We have played 80 to 90 ODIs together Thats the plus point, it also helps me personally. I can pick ideas according to the situation. The fielding has also improved We have raised the bar.         
	Asked about Sachin Tendulkar who had voluntarily ruled himself out of Indias Twenty20 scheme of things, Dhoni said: Its tough, you always want a player like Sachin in your side. He has a big impact in the dressing room, has lots of ideas. But he wasnt at the last Twenty20 (World Championships in South Africa) The guys are getting used to it.

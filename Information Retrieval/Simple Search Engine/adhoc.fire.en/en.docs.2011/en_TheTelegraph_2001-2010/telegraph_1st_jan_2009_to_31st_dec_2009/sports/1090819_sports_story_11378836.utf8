The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Force for Independence Cup
                                                                                                               Force for Independence Cup
            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Arctic Force, with C. Alford in the saddle, may be hard to beat in the 1,400m Independence Cup, the feature event in Wednesdays race card. Having started his monsoon seasons campaign with a runaway victory over a smart sprinter, Special Star, the Vijay Singh-trained youngster gives the impression that he is on the up. The challenge to the Razeen son may come from trainer Havinder Singh Baths colt, Secret Whispers, the winner of the Grand Annual Handicap, last winter.          
	Another one who may take some beating is trainer Bharath Singhs Colourful Lady in the 1,800m StoneyValley Cup. In her last run, the Burden Of Proof filly  a failed favourite  was ill at ease in the blinding rain, yet she placed a good third to Compton Star in a 1,400m race. The slated trip would be more to her advantage. Suraj Narredu partners the four-year-old filly.

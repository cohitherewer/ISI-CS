                                                   Gambhir the only Indian in top 10
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Gautam Gambhir is the lone Indian in the top 10 in the Reliance Mobile ICC Player Rankings for Test batsmen while teammate Harbhajan Singh is at eighth on the bowlers chart.         
	According to an ICC release, the Delhi southpaw, with 771 rating points, is two spots above his opening partner and fellow Delhi player, Virender Sehwag, who is placed at 12. Master blaster, Sachin Tendulkar and V.V.S. Laxman are jointly placed at the 16th spot on the chart.         
	The ICC Cricketer of the Year for 2008, Shivnarine Chanderpaul of the West Indies, still holds the number-one position on the batsmens list while teammate, Chris Gayle, will be looking to improve upon his current 19th spot in the Test series against England beginning in Kingston Wednesday.         
	England batsman Kevin Pietersen is at fourth while Strauss is 15th, not far behind the South Africa pair of Ashwell Prince (14th) and Jacques Kallis (13th).         
	England, ranked fifth on the Reliance Mobile ICC Test Championship table and the West Indies, who are currently lying at seventh will be under pressure from New Zealand as they are just ahead of Daniel Vettoris men by a fraction of a ratings point.         
	If the West Indies lose the series by two matches or more they will fall to eighth.         
	Victory for them will keep Sri Lanka on their toes and with a busy Test year ahead for England, which includes a home series against the West Indies as well as the Ashes before they embark on a tour of South Africa at the end of 2009.         
	India, meanwhile continue to hold on to their third position in the Test team rankings.         
	Among bowlers, apart from Harbhajan (686 points), Zaheer Khan (12th) is the only other Indian to feature in the top 20. Sri Lankan spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan leads the bowlers list with 887 points.

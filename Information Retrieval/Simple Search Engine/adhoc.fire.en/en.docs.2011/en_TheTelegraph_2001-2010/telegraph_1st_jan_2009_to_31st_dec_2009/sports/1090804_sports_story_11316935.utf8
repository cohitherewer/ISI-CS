The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Minister supports Wada code
                                                   Minister supports Wada code
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES                      
	New Delhi: The sports minister M.S. Gill on Monday came out in support of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) code, saying all sports federations, including the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) should adopt it.         
	Asked to comment on the controversial whereabouts clause that has evoked protests from Indian cricketers as well as their Board, the minister said it did not infringe upon the privacy of the players.         
	Talking to the media after the state sports ministers conference here, Gill said: We have accepted the Wada regulatory testing and we adhere to it. Sportspersons should be clear about one thing: it is not getting into someones life.         
	All sportspersons should adhere to it and happily follow it, as so many sports federations and players have, Gill said.         
	The BCCI reacted to this saying the sports ministers view was his personal opinion and that the Board would stick to its own stance.         
	Reacting to Gills comments, BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla said the matter was currently under discussion between the Board and the International Cricket Council (ICC) and that the sports ministry neednt get involved.         
	The sports minister has got his personal view on the subject but we, at the BCCI, have taken a position which ensures what is promised in the Indian Constitution, Shukla told reporters.         
	The BCCI has asked the ICC, a Wada signatory, to explore the possibility of having an anti-doping mechanism of its own. Gill, however, felt that Wada was championing a good cause and that every one should support it.         
	Shukla made it clear that the Board had no issues with random testing during a tournament but it was not comfortable with the idea of out-of-competition tests.         
	As long as they want to test players during a competition, we would abide by all Wada rules. But outside the tournament, we think the players should be exempted, Shukla added.         
	The whereabouts clause of the Wada code has become the bone of contention with the 11 Indian cricketers in the testing pool refusing to sign the provision. This they consider a breach of privacy and a security risk as well.         
	We should support Wada in its cause. The world is concerned about doping and we should support it (Wada), the sports minister said.         
	Gill said that he was proud that India already had a Wada accredited National Doping Test Laboratory in Delhi.         
	We have set up a dope testing laboratory next to the Nehru Stadium and now Sweden is also sending samples of their players for testing. We should be proud of it, Gill added.

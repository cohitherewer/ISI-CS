The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team India need to keep the momentum going
                                                     Team India need to keep the momentum going
  - Doubt over dhonis fitness after captain injures ankle               Yuvraj Singh after completing his century at Sabina Park on Friday. (AFP)                           
	Kingston: Having survived a scare in the opening match, India go into the second one-dayer against the West Indies here Sunday, fully aware that they need to maintain their intensity right through the match to take an invincible 2-0 lead.         
	The Indians just about managed a narrow 20-run victory in the first match on Friday and, as Mahendra Singh Dhoni admitted, were a little complacent in the later stages of the game. They very nearly paid the price for it.         
	There, however, is a question mark over Dhoni being 100 per cent fit for Sundays match. The Team India captain twisted his ankle Friday and required lengthy medical attention on the field.         
	The close game will serve as a wake-up call for the visitors who are determined to make amends for their World Twenty20 debacle by clinching the four-match series. It remains to be been seen how the Indians respond to their captain who finds himself under some pressure now.         
	With the dashing Virender Sehwag not available for the series, the Indians have struggled to get the starts though new opener Dinesh Karthik did well by scoring 67.         
	The left-handed Gautam Gambhir has not been in good nick for some time now and the Delhi batsman will be keen to rediscover his touch.         
	The Indian top-order remained suspect against the short ball with Gambhir and Rohit Sharma falling to miscued pulls.         
	Yuvraj, who clobbered a rollicking 131 in the first match, has been in excellent form and will have to shoulder the responsibility of taking India to a healthy total.         
	Bowling in the slog overs continued to remain an area of concern for India.         
	West Indies, who were brave in their chase despite losing wickets at regular intervals, will surely look to bounce back to draw parity in the series.         
	They needed one batsman to play a big innings like Yuvraj had done for the Indians, and the others could play the supporting role. The West Indies bowling appeared indisciplined as they did not maintain the right line and length on the slow track.         
	Skipper Chris Gayle confessed his batsmen failed to capitalise on the good start. We came close and the effort cant be faulted for the way we went about it. I think that we had a good start which we should have capitalised on, he said.

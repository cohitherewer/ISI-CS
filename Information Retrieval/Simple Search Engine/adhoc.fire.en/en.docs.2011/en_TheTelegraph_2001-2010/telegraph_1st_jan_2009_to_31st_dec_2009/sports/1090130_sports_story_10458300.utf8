The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Poor shots let us down: Utpal
                                                   Poor shots let us down: Utpal
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: East Zone coach Utpal Chatterjee said poor shot selection more than moisture in the wicket led to the teams batting disaster on the opening day of the Duleep Trophy semi-final against West Zone on Thursday.         
	Simply put, we played badly. We did not play the spinner (Rajesh Pawar) well, Utpal told The Telegraph. The pitch had a lot of bounce and turn, and there was a lot of moisture as well. But the batsmen were playing against the spin.         
	A score of 250-plus would have been par for the first day on this wicket  We need to restrict them (West) to 225. If they score anything above 250, we would struggle, Utpal added.         
	Bengal batsman Manoj Tiwary refused to be bogged down despite the teams poor batting display and his own dismissal for just 13.

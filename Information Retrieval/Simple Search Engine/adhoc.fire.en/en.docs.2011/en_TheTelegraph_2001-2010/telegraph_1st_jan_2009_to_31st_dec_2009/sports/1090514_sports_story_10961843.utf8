The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gilchrist: We gifted the game away
                                                   Gilchrist: We gifted the game away
            OUR BUREAU                      
	Deccan Chargers captain Adam Gilchrist said that they committed suicide, and in the process, gifted the game to the Delhi DareDevils in Durban on Wednesday. According to him, the Chargers need to work hard as their chances were still not over.               
	The following are excerpts         
	VIRENDER SEHWAG: I was pretty happy and confident with the total (173). I knew we had a good bowling line-up. But Gilchrist and Symonds played very well Sangwan bowled really well and Bhatia did well in the closing stages bowling the yorkers and the slower ones. I relied on him and knew his abilities. We have a motivation in that if we win, we get $50,000 from our franchise. Thats not a small amount and always a good motivation. We want to enjoy it...         
	ADAM GILCHRIST: We have just gifted the game away with both bat and ball. You cannot drop catches like that. We committed cricket suicide. The standard of catching in this tournament hasnt been high and it was disappointing that we lost the two points today. We were in the game but failed to maintain the momentum till the last. We need to keep the work going and I believe we are still in the running for a semi-final berth         
	RAJAT BHATIA (Man of the Match): I never thought that I would make such a good comeback. I was confident that something would happen. I was just bowling the yorkers and the slower ones I bowled according to the situation. I knew that we had to stay calm, and thats how it worked. Its all about the mind games

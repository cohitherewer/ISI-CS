The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Winning debut for Beckham
                                                   Winning debut for Beckham
                      
	Dubai: David Beckham made his AC Milan debut with a steady first-half run-out against Hamburg SV in a friendly on Tuesday, the Italians going on to win 4-3 on penalties after the match finished 1-1.         
	Beckham has joined the Serie A club on a short loan spell from Los Angeles Galaxy to keep up his fitness and stay in the England picture during the US close season.         
	The former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder was soon involved, sending a long ball into the Hamburg penalty area seeking out Andriy Shevchenko.         
	He later set up Alexandre Pato to shoot straight at the Hamburg keeper before being substituted at half-time.         
	Ronaldinho broke the deadlock for Milan, scoring from the penalty spot in the 61st minute, but Hamburg were quick to equalise with a close-range effort from Collin Benjamin in the 66th minute.

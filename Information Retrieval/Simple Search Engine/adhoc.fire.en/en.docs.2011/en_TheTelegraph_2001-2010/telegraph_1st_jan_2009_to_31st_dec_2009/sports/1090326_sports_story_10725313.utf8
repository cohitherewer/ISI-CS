The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AIFF gets tough with Derrick
                                                   AIFF gets tough with Derrick
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Wednesday slapped a one-match ban on Mahindra United coach Derrick Pereira for his unpleasant altercation with match officials during the Mumbai sides 2-3 defeat against Dempo Sports Club.         
	The I-League match was played at Margao on Monday.         
	The federation has also written to the Mahindra coach asking him to explain why further disciplinary action will not be taken against him for his unsporting behaviour.         
	As per the AIFF ruling, Pereira will not be allowed to sit at the team bench in the next match against Sporting Clube de Goa on Saturday.         
	According to the report submitted by the match commissioner, Pereira was involved in a nasty confrontation with the referee Rizwan Ul-Haq for awarding a free kick in favour of Dempo. The decision cost Mahindra dearly as Ranty Martins struck the match-winner from the free kick.

	Last year, Kolkata Knight Riders did not make it to the semi-finals, and despite the many highs and lows and hits and misses, I was reasonably satisfied with the performance of the squad we had for IPL 2008. However, the Knight Riders have chosen to make some changes for the 2009 season and we believe we have gained in strength with the inclusion of the likes of Angelo Matthews, Brad Hodge and Ajantha Mendis.         
	We are looking to add to that through the auction, and we will also be looking for a replacement for Umar Gul, who was an integral part of the side. We are trying to build a franchise, taking the long-term development of the team into consideration.         
	We want the KKR brand to be recognised around the world as a premier sports brand, both for its on-field performances and what it stands for off the field. So with respect to performances on the field, we are keen on developing a player bank, the idea being to focus on young Indian talent.         
	Last year a number of rookies like Ashok Dinda, Wriddhiman Saha, Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Debabrata Das rubbed shoulders with experienced internationals like Ricky Ponting, Sourav Ganguly and Brendon McCullum, and that worked very well for them. With that in mind, then, we have already recruited Anureet Singh, Mohnish Parmar, Shatrunjay Gaekwad and Natraj Behera. We are hoping to include some of the youngsters into the squad for the coming season while finalising the players in the weeks leading up to the start of the second edition of the IPL.         
	Fridays auction will be an exciting affair, with big names like Kevin Pietersen, Andrew Flintoff and Jean-Paul Duminy in the fray. It is time when all the franchises will scramble to get the best names on their rolls. The presence of these stars will add to the drama of the auction and it is an event that will excite and whet the appetite of cricket enthusiasts the world over.         
	Pietersen and Flintoff are two of the premier players on the world stage whose game is suited to the 20-over format and there will be a number of franchises who will be eager to gain their services  which means their final auction price will be much higher than the base bidding price.         
	As for the captain, Sourav and I have had very productive discussions about the first IPL, and in my two visits to India since then, we have discussed a number of things in terms of the make-up of the team, strategy and leadership.         
	I look forward to seeing Sourav again at the pre-IPL camp and training sessions. Sourav may have finished with his international career, but still believes that he has a long way to go and a big role to play with KKR.         
	This year the auction is being held in the beautiful state of Goa, and, after missing the last one, I am looking forward to experiencing all the excitement first-hand!

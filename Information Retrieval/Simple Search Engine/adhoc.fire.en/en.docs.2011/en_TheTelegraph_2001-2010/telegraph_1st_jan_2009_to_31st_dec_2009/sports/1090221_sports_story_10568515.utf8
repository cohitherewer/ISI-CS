                                                   Tough draw for colts
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: India have drawn tough groups for the under-16 and under-19 Asian championship qualifiers to be played later this year.         
	In the under-16 qualifiers, India are in group D, along with United Arab Emirates, Turkmenistan, Oman, Jordan and Kyrgyzstan. A total of 45 teams are participating in the championship starting in October.         
	In the under-19 qualifiers, the draw of which too was made at the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) headquarters in Kuala Lumpur on Friday, 42 teams were slotted into seven groups of six teams each.         
	India have been placed in group C and will face Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Oman, Kuwait and Afghanistan.         
	Its a tough draw for us in both the age group qualifiers, said India s British coach Colin Toal. May be the under-16 group is a bit kinder. We have to really do well to advance to the next round.

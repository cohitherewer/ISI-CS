The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vaughan building up for England return
                                                     Vaughan building up for England return
            Nelson Clare            Michael Vaughan                           
	Former England captain Michael Vaughan insists he retains the drive to return to international cricket.         
	Vaughan, 34, is not in the 16-man Test squad to tour the Caribbean from next week and is instead with Yorkshire, building up fitness for the 2009 season.         
	Having led England to Ashes victory four years ago, however, he is keen for another shot at the Australians this summer.         
	Vaughan, who accepts it was the right decision to omit him from the tour party, said: Its the first time in a long time where Ive been able to do normal things.         
	I feel very refreshed and excited  and thats very important.         
	I am 34 and I feel as though Ive got a few more years left in me.         
	You have to have that excitement and buzz, and really want to go out there and perform, and I certainly have those feelings.         
	Englands start to the Ashes year has been blighted by the unseemly row which resulted in the sacking of coach Peter Moores and removal of Kevin Pietersen as captain.         
	However, Vaughan is adamant Pietersen was the right man to succeed him at the helm last August.         
	He was definitely the man for the job, I still think he could do a really good job, said Vaughan.         
	As England captain he was very forward thinking, very committed, obviously ruffled a few feathers.         
	But I dont mind that  Nasser Hussain did that as captain and did a fantastic job. Graeme Smith has done that for South Africa.         
	Everyone has got to be themselves, and Kevin Pietersen tried to do it his way and he said last week in his (newspaper) column that he feels his captaincy days arent finished yet.         
	For now, though, Pietersen will return to the ranks aiming to add to his 15 Test hundreds and help England develop some winning momentum under new leader Andrew Strauss following the very public breakdown of the teams management.         
	What they really need is to go out there and play some cricket, said Vaughan. I just want us to get out there and play and the boys will just want to get back onto the cricket pitch and win some games.         
	I felt for everyone because I dont think anyone has come out of it smelling of roses.         
	Its been a really difficult time for the England team but hopefully we can now move forward.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

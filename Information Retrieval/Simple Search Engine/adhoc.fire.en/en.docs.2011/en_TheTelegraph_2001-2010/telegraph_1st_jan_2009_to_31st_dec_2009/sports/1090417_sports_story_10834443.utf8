The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Three who made a difference
                                                   Three who made a difference
                                  
	Okolie Odafe: The Nigerian, who has become the highest goal-scorer of the season for the third time in a row, is undoubtedly the most potent weapon in the Churchill armoury. The 24-year-olds goal-poaching skills made sure that his team had a better goal-difference over the rivals, which cost them the title last season.               
	Gourmangi Singh: The India defender won his third national league title, the previous teams being Dempo (2004-5) and Mahindra United (2005-6). The Manipur lad, known for his prowess in the air, has lent solidity to Churchills defence which was leaky, to say the least, last season.               
	Ogba Kalu: Despite being overshadowed by skipper Odafe, the Nigerian midfielder played a crucial role for Churchill this season. Kalu has been the backbone of the team with his clever tackles and passes. His six goals prove that Kalu can switch from a defensive to attacking role effortlessly.                           
	Zoran Djordjevic: The Serbian becomes the first foreign coach to win the national league title. Djordjevic, who took over the Churchills reins only a couple of days before their first match of the I-League, has now given them their maiden title. He has been instrumental in unlocking the talents of several key players in the team, especially that of Kalu.

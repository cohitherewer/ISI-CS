	Calcutta: East Bengals practice tour to Myanmar started off on a wrong note when they lost their first match 1-2 to Yadandon FC in Mandalay on Sunday, according to information received here.         
	The red and gold brigade scored first through Harmanjot Singh Khabra. However, the Myanmarese National league champions regrouped and hit back pumping in two goals.         
	East Bengals Czech recruit Jan Berger had an impressive outing playing an active role in the mid-field.         
	Coach Subhas Bhowmick had planned the tour as part of preparations for the ensuing season. But losing the first match must have unsettled Bhowmick a little and he will try to garner a positive result in the next match in Yangon on Wednesday.         
	The club was unable to take Lebanese Rameez Dayub to Myanmar as the players former club, Safa FC, were reluctant to release him.         
	The city giants play a total of four practice matches during the tour. The rest of the matches are in Yangon. They return to the city on August 24.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhullar in lead 
                                                   Bhullar in lead 
                      
	Jakarta: Chasing his maiden Asian Tour title, Gaganjeet Bhullar fired a sensational 10-under 62 to grab a two-stroke lead in the weather-hit third round of the Indonesia President Invitational golf tournament here Saturday.         
	The 21-year-old compiled a blemish-free card with 10 birdies, holing out a closing birdie on the 18th hole in fading light for a three-day total of 17-under 199 at the Damai Indah Golf  Bumi Serpong Damai course.         
	It gave the Indian a chance to avenge his loss in the $400,000 event two years ago when he was beaten by one stroke by Filipino Juvic Pagunsans birdie-eagle finish.         
	It feels almost like 2007 again, but there is still one day to go, 18 more holes to go, said Bhullar, who was the joint third round leader two years ago.         
	Im confident going into the final round and Im hitting the ball well. Im not thinking about a victory but I just hope to play like I played Saturday, said Bhullar, who played in his first British Open last week.         
	Among the other Indians in fray, Amandeep Johl held on to the tied 26th spot after carding a third successive 70 that left him six-under overall.         
	Further down, Rahil Gangjee was tied 43rd spot but he was yet to complete his round and was three-under at the 15th hole.         
	Anirban Lahiri shared the 54th spot after stuttering to a 76 that left his total at two-under 214.

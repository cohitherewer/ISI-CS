The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Moores a fantastic guy: Kevin
                                                   Moores a fantastic guy: Kevin
                      
	London: The dust is yet to settle on their bitter fallout but former England captain Kevin Pietersen said Peter Moores is a fantastic guy and he does not have any personal problem with the sacked coach.         
	Petersons working relationship with Moores broke down during the India tour and things came to a head when the former coach, as part of the selection panel, snubbed Michael Vaughan for the West Indies tour, much against Pietersens wish.         
	Pietersen subsequently told the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) that he could not work with Moores and the captain-coach feud eventually cost both the individuals their jobs.         
	Pietersen admitted he and Moores made an odd couple but insisted he didnt have any personal issue with him.         
	Hes a fantastic guy, Pietersen told a TV channel.         
	Ive heard a comment of his where he says he wants England to win and he does want England to win. Hes passionate about winning.         
	I have absolutely no personal problem with Peter Moores, I just didnt feel that me and him could take the team forward, Pietersen said.         
	Soon after he relinquished captaincy, speculation was rife that Pietersen might turn his back on England and take the plunge in the cash-rich Indian Premier League.         
	The South Africa-born cricketer said such a thought never crossed his mind.         
	I never, ever once thought that Im going to leave England and Ive been betrayed and Im angry towards anybody at all, he said.         
	I just thought, okay, Im gonna have to become a soldier again and go back and do batting, which I absolutely love, added the maverick batsman.

                                                   Fast bowling is very rewarding, says Lee
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: After winning the Champions Trophy with Australia in South Africa, Brett Lee is now looking forward to do his best in the one-day International series against India. Lee, who will be representing the New South Wales Blues in the Champions League Twenty20, said it will be a huge and highly exciting series.         
	On Thursday morning, Lee was not bowling bouncers or yorkers but fielded a volley of questions from the media at a pleasant interaction here.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q On winning the Champions Trophy         
	A I was very impressed with the way Australia played in the Champions Trophy in South Africa. In the last couple of matches, we played our best cricket. We played decent cricket throughout but the best was in the last match. It was a great feeling to walk away with the trophy from South Africa. It was a great moment indeed.         
	If Ricky Ponting has proved his critics wrong         
	When you lose, the first person to get the blame is the captain and when you win, the first prize also goes to the captain. We are a side that backs their captain. We, as a team, will always stand by Ponting. He is a great captain He hasnt got anything to prove to the media, he has proved himself on the field.         
	The upcoming India-Australia ODI series         
	Oh, its going to be a tough tour, very challenging. Its a huge series. Australia versus India is always exciting. Its always a tough tour but a great tour.         
	On the India-Australia rivalry         
	As hard as we play on the field, as soon as the game is over, the sportsmanship is great.         
	The secret of his success in his long career         
	The most important thing is that I still work hard on my fitness. I love and enjoy playing cricket and want to continue for a long time.         
	On whether he would change his style of bowling if he loses pace in the near future         
	Well, if you mean that I would bowl out-swingers at 130 kph, sorry thats not going to happen. I enjoy bowling fast. It means a lot to be the worlds fastest bowler. If it happens that I am not going at 150 kph, then probably, I have to think of a plan B.         
	How has fast bowling evolved over the years?         
	See, fast bowling is a tough job. Its the hardest job in the world but the rewards are also very satisfying. There is a no better sight than an in-swinger hitting the toes or a ball making the stumps fly. The wickets nowadays are conducive for fast bowling.         
	His own form at the moment         
	I am trying my hardest. I am happy with the way I bowled in England. I couldnt play the Tests as I was injured. But I did well in the one-dayers. Now I am playing Twenty20. This could be a stepping stone for me to play Test cricket again. I am happy with my form.         
	On the New South Wales Blues chances in the Champions League         
	We would be doing a lot of research tonight (Thursday). We have got a good side here. We have a lot of experienced guys. We just have to make sure that we play good cricket.         
	His views on the match fixing allegations after the Australia-Pakistan match in the Champions Trophy         
	I think its not for me to comment on the issue at this point of time, its for the ICC to say.         
	On the current Australia bowling attack         
	Its a good attack as we have got the combination of experience and youth. I got injured and missed the Ashes but Mitchell (Johnson) is going from strength to strength.         
	Any security concerns in India?         
	Security is one thing that is handled by Cricket Australia. Personally, I can say we have never had a problem. India is a great country. We have got the seven-match ODI series coming against India. I am happy to be here.         
	Is there too much money in T20 which is not good for the youngsters?         
	I think its good that more money is coming in cricket. But its critical that we focus on the bat and the ball and the rest (money and fame) will follow.

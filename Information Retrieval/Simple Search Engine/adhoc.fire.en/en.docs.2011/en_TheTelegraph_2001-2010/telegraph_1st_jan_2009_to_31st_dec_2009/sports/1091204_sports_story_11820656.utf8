	Now, the fun starts. On Friday, footballs global family will focus its attention on the Cape Town International Centre for the 2010 World Cup draw. The 32 teams who have made it will find out exactly who and where they would be playing.        
	For the last few days, I have been reading a lot of reports in different newspapers on the World Cup draw. The highly intelligent and clever publicity managers of the game in the world body have made the draw ceremony appear almost as exciting as the actual tournament.        
	Personally, I have been following the World Cups keenly from the days when the championship was not as big as it is today, at least in India. Those days, no one bothered much about the draw as, during the 60s and the 70s, Fifa too kept it a lowkey affair.        
	I know that on Friday, I wont be able to resist sitting in front of the television to watch the ceremony that will be beamed live to 200 countries across the world. I shall be very eager to know what teams are pitted against Brazil and Spain in the group league or who would challenge defending champions Italy, the team eager to become the first after Brazil to bag backtoback World Cups.        
	There is one more thing that will keep me awake for the World Cup draw. It would be exciting to see whether North Korea and Italy are clubbed in the same group or if they get a chance to cross each others paths later in the tournament.         
	I still remember in 1966 the North Koreans shocked everyone by defeating Italy in the World Cup in England. The North Korean victory was no fluke and the Italians were greeted by an angry mob at the airport when they returned home.         
	After beating Italy 1-0, the North Koreans were 3-0 up against Portugal before the great Eusebio rescued his team with four goals in a 5-3 win. The North Koreans are back in the World Cup for the first time since England 66 and I hope to see them causing a few more upsets in South Africa.        
	Although we have seen all the teams closely during the qualifiers over the past two years, it would not be right to pick the favourites just yet.         
	I know that footballs romantics are hoping for a mouthwatering final between Brazil and Spain, the joint favourites for the bookmakers, but the World Cup frequently throws up surprises and I am confident that it wont be any different this time.        
	It may be too much to ask but, personally, I would like to see an African team winning the World Cup in their continent. Going by current results, I dont have much faith in South Africa and would like to pin hopes on Ivory Coast, who have the likes of top stars Didier Drogba and Kolo Toure in their lineup.        
	South Korea and Japan made us feel proud when the World Cup was hosted in Asia in 2002. Given their skills and physical strength, the African nations have the ability to spring similar surprises.

                                                   Pollock: ODIs are better than T20
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Fans may drool over Twenty20, but former South Africa captain Shaun Pollock refuses to switch allegiance and insists one-day cricket remains the best limited-overs format.         
	Looking ahead to next months Champions Trophy in South Africa, Pollock said one-day was a great format and he could not wait for the elite top-eight event to get underway.         
	Its a great format and Im glad the tournaments coming to South Africa, Pollock said in an ICC release.         
	Having played a lot (of 50-over cricket), maybe Im a bit more of a sucker when it comes to appreciating the game. The fast 20-over game has caught the imagination of many but if you get off to a bad start then you can cost yourself the game.         
	There is a lot of skill involved in the 50-over game and its over a much longer period, so that allows teams to have a bit of a mishap and recover from it and youve got time to implement tactics, said the former all-rounder.         
	I think ODIs are still the best format of limited-overs cricket, especially with regard to making sure the best team comes out on top, he added.         
	 Pollock hailed the format of Champions Trophy which features the top eight-ranked international sides in a short, sharp contest of 15 matches in two weeks from September 22.         
	A lot of sports have gone that way (involving just those sides at the top end of the rankings). Tennis and golf are just two that have done it. Its always good when youve got the best teams competing against each other and thats exactly what youll have here, he said.

	Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket India (BCCI) working committee will meet here on December 18 to explore the possibility of squeezing in some Test matches when South Africa visit the country in February-March next year for a five-match one-day International (ODI) series.         
	At present, the tour consists of five ODIs only. Theres a chance of including Tests too, and it would be decided at the working committee meeting of the Board in Mumbai on December 18, the BCCI sources said Thursday.         
	The belated move to play a few Tests against South Africa in the short window available between Indias visit to Bangladesh in early January and the start of the Indian Premier League on March 12 next year would provide them a chance to maintain their No. 1 Test status, which they acquired for the first time by their 2-0 series win over Sri Lanka.         
	India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and maestro Sachin Tendulkar, among others, have expressed their wish that India should play more Tests than what has been scheduled.         
	As per the current ICC Future Tours Programme (FTP), India will not be playing any Test cricket for nine months after their two-Test series in Bangladesh in January.         
	The next Test series India are to take part in is the three-match home rubber against the West Indies in October-November.         
	In the 13 months  from the tour to Bangladesh in January 2010 till the start of the World Cup in February 2011  India are to play only eight Tests  two in Bangladesh, three at home against the West Indies and three in South Africa (Dec. 2010-Jan. 2011).         
	Post-World Cup, India are scheduled to travel to the West Indies and play four Tests in April-May, 2011, tour England in July-August to take on the hosts in four Tests, before playing a three-Test home series against New Zealand in November-December.         
	As per the FTP, a tour to Australia for four Tests is fixed between December, 2011 and January, 2012 before a home and away series against Pakistan. (Agencies)

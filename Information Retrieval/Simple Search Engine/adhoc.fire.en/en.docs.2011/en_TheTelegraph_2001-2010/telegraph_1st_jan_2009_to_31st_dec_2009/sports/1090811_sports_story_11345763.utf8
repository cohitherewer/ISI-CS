The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AIFF drops Palestine 
                                                   AIFF drops Palestine 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Nehru Cup 2009 was reduced to a five-nation meet when the All India Football Federation (AIFF) scratched Palestine for sending a club side in the disguise of their national team.         
	According to AIFF sources, the organising committee of the Nehru Cup, which met here on Monday, decided to inform the Palestine football federation that their team was no longer needed for the tournament.         
	On Sunday, it was reported in the media that the Palestine team was actually a club side that has been playing in the West Bank Premier League. The AIFF, which was in dark till then, contacted the Fifa agent, who arranged for the team and found the matter to be true.         
	The development has definitely left the AIFF red faced as Palestine was included in the draw at the last moment after Thailand refused to send their national team for the Nehru Cup.         
	AIFF sources said that there was hardly any time left to invite another team for the tournament.         
	Under the present circumstances, the AIFF is likely to change the draw and make it a round-robin meet like it was in 2007. The top two teams will play in the final. The Nehru Cup begins on August 19.

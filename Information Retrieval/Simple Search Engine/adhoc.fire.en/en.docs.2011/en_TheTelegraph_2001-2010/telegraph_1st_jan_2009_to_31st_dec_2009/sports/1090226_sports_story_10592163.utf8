The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Batting a worry for us: Mithali
                                                   Batting a worry for us: Mithali
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mithali Raj, Indias batting fulcrum, believes that the team has to sort out its batting problems quickly if it hopes to repeat, if not better, its 2005 performance in the upcoming womens cricket World Cup in Australia.         
	Our bowling is pretty decent and the fielding is always improving. But batting has been an area of concern, she said after the teams training session here on Wednesday.         
	Mithali, while speaking on Indias dismal performance in England and Australia in the recent past, said: In England and Australia, we could not pile up scores. We didnt get proper starts and the middle order was getting exposed to the new ball.         
	A total of 130 is not defendable, you need a minimum of 200 runs in a one-day International and for that the top order has to click, the 26-year-old batting star said.         
	The quadrennial event begins on March 7, with India taking on Pakistan in Group B at the Bradman Oval in Bowral in one of the two opening fixtures.

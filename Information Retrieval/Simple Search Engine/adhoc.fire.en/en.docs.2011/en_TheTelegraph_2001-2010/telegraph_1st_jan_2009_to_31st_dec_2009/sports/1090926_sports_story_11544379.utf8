                                                   EB clarify stand on Bhutia
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal Friday in a statement said that Bhiachung Bhutia practised with the club only to keep himself fit physically and the club has no reason to mingle with the arbitrator or any AIFF official.         
	In the release, East Bengal clarified their stand with respect to Bhutias training at the club.         
	He (Bhaichung) is being allowed to practice with our team, at his request, solely to enable him to keep fit physically The fact is East Bengal has had no reason or desire to mingle with the arbitrator or any official of the AIFF regarding the Bhaichung Bhutia imbroglio, the statement said.         
	Without naming their arch rivals, East Bengal, however, in the release, cited the example of Snehashish Chakraborty, who had donned Mohun Bagan jersey before he was released by the club.         
	I dont think its (Bhutias practice) against the law. We have done it and will do it in future also, a senior club official said.         
	According to him, the club has entered into an Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Bhutia for the next season.         
	Incidentally, Bhutia practised with East Bengal players on Friday afternoon too.

                                                   IPL rejects PCB request on Asif
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Indian Premier League (IPL) on Monday rejected the Pakistan Cricket Boards request to advance the date of commencement of the 12-month ban on Mohammed Asif. The pacer had tested positive for nandrolone during the tournaments inaugural edition last year.         
	The IPL Drug Tribunal said that the ban on the Pakistani pacer would commence from September 22, 2008, as that was the date when the suspension came into effect. But the PCB had argued that the players doping violation was revealed on July 14, and therefore the ban should be considered to have commenced from the following day, July 15.         
	We cannot accept the PCB request because Asif had asked for a B sample test in September.         
	So, the IPL Drug Tribunal had gone on that basis and imposed the ban as starting from September 22, 2008, IPL chairman Lalit Modi told reporters.         
	Asif had an option to appeal against the Tribunals verdict but he had not done that  The IPL Drug Tribunal has the authority to impose the ban, he added.         
	Modi also said that the IPL would from now on be governed by BCCIs own anti-doping code.

  - I-league Hammond scores the winner for red and gold brigade       OUR CORRESPONDENT            Abel Hammond                                 
	Mumbai: East Bengal recorded their second successive win in the I-League, edging Air India 1-0 in a hard-fought encounter here on Saturday.         
	Abel Hammonds 29th-minute header proved to be good enough for the Calcutta giants, who recorded their first win against Air India at the Cooperage since 2003. After being winless in the first five rounds, East Bengal have now earned three points from an away match for the second time in a row. Their previous win was against Viva Kerala.         
	The hosts were done in by injuries to Behnam Foroughirad and goalkeeper Arnab Das Sharma, midway through the first half. Even before coach Bimal Ghosh could replace them, Subhash Singh received a corner kick and set it up for Hammond to score.         
	The visitors could have added to their tally, but Srecko Metrovics right-footer bounced off the goalline after hitting the bar.         
	In the second half, Yusif Yakubus free-kick was blocked by Sambhu Mistry, who replaced Arnab, and Hammonds tap from the rebound hit the far post. However, the assistant referees flag had gone up by then.         
	It was not that Air India could not create chances. Ghoshs men piled on the pressure in the second half.         
	Dada Nabeel missed the mark in the 70th minute, when his shot went over the bar. Later, A slow Tapan Maity was foiled inside the box.         
	The loss of Foroughirad and Arnab proved to be a real blow. Ghoshs strategy of using the tall Harpreet Singh for headers never worked as the latter hardly moved up.         
	Adding insult to injury, Henry Ghangte and captain Soccor Velho picked up yellow cards and would miss the next match, against Mahindra United, on Thursday.         
	East Bengal now have nine points, one less than archrivals Mohun Bagan. Air India, on the other hand, have just five points from six games.         
	Syed Rahim Nabi had a mixed feeling about the teams victory. We have won back to matches now and both (Viva Kerala and Air India) were tough teams. It has given us the confidence and boosted our morale, Nabi said.         
	But they (Air India) didnt play that well and missed some chances today. I think we played better against Mahindra United(in a second round match) although we didnt get three points.

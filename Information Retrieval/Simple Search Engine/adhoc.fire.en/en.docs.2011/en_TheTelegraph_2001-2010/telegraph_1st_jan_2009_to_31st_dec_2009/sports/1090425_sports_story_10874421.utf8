	Wed got ourselves back in the game and the way Sourav (Ganguly) played was outstanding... But he left with a ball remaining... (Ajantha) Mendis was given the Super Over as hed bowled very well in the match and had got (Yusuf) Pathan as well... Id thought if they hit him once too often, then one could go up in the air... Laxmi (Ratan Shukla) was promoted for him to have a go at the spinners... Its tough on us mentally... Any time you get into a situation of winning the game and you dont, then, it does have a bit of an impact on the side... But we also know its a long tournament...

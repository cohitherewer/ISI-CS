The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Deep defence is our major worry
                                                     Deep defence is our major worry
                  STICKWORK    Gurbux Singh      
	The performance of the Indian team on their tour of Australia and New Zealand is nothing to cheer about. An unnecessary war of words between coach Harendra Singh and Ric Charlesworth has also not helped.         
	Our team, as I had said earlier during the Punjab Gold Cup, was just about adequate. And I find practically the same bunch of players picked for the tour.         
	The performance of the team in the two matches played against the Australian development side has exposed the defence.         
	First, the goalkeeper  who conceded 10 goals in two matches  is hardly one who can give confidence to the players.         
	The deep defence  consisting of the experienced and ageing Dilip Tirkey and captain Sandeep Singh  can hardly be the defence which India require. Although Sandeeps being a penalty corner specialist has stood the team in good stead, his defensive capabilities remain suspect.         
	I believe that an experienced half-line or midfield has to do a lot of work. But in this department, too, only time can tell how much Ignace Tirkey and Vikram Pillai can help. The forward line is decent, but again just adequate. The malady of not being able to convert the chances remains the most glaring shortcoming.         
	In New Zealand so far, the teams performance  one draw and one win to lead the four-match Test series 1-0  has been okay, but how they play against the top war-horses of international hockey like Holland, Germany, Australia or Spain remains to be seen.         
	India have a busy schedule this year and I would like to see at least some youngsters tried in every department, except that of the goalkeeper. There arent too many of them in this country that fit the bill, but we would have to start looking for a replacement in three to four years time.         
	Coming to local hockey, this year again, the battle for the possession of the grounds has been going on between the Bengal Hockey Association (BHA) and the clubs allotted the enclosed grounds on the Maidan. I do not understand how some people have the idea that hockey and football can be played on the same ground simultaneously.         
	Bengal hockey has brought a lot of glory to the state, with Bengal Olympians having won 27 gold, one silver and three bronze medals between them. This feat is unparalleled  no other sport has brought so much glory to Bengal  still some feel that people should stop playing hockey in Calcutta. What Calcutta hockey needs is an artificial surface; all the problems would be solved. The local league has already started but the contest is yet to warm up as the big names have not made an appearance so far.         
	The impasse between the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) continues. The Delhi High Court has given March 2 as the date for the hearing.         
	All I have to say is that sooner the elections to the IHF take place the better, since it is only with the elections that hockeys recovery can begin.

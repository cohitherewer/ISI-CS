	New Delhi: Railways, looking for a quarter final berth, will have to play out of their skins against Punjab in their must-win Ranji Trophy Super League encounter that begins Tuesday.         
	With Tamil Nadu already through from Group A, Railways, under Murali Kartik, need five points to emerge second best in the group, which means not even a draw with a first innings is good enough.         
	Punjab, currently at second position with 16 points, need just a draw to make it to the next round.         
	In Rajkot, Saurashtra play Karnataka in the last Super League Group B match after two consecutive defeats at the hands of Delhi and Baroda.

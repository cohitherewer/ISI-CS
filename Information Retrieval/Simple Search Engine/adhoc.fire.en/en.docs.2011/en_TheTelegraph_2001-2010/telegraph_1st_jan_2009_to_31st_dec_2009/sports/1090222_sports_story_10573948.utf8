                                                     Sreevats, Bose shine in Bengal win
            A STAFF REPORTER            Ranadeb Bose                           
	Calcutta: A slow but steady Bengal beat Orissa by six wickets at the Eden Gardens on Saturday to confirm their place at the top of the table in the East Zone National one-dayers for the Vijay Hazare Trophy.         
	After being asked to bat first, Orissa managed to put up a modest total of 211 for seven in their 50 overs, in the face of some precise bowling by Bengal. The hosts reached the target without too much fuss, with 19 deliveries to spend.         
	If veteran Ranadeb Bose was the star with the ball in the morning, youngster Sreevats Goswami was the fulcrum of Bengals chase in the afternoon.         
	Ranadeb, who was the main architect with the ball behind Bengals successful return to the Ranji Trophy Elite Group this season, maintained impeccable line and length on Saturday. The right-arm pacer picked up three wickets in his 10 overs, giving away 40 runs. He has continued to impress with the ball but nobody knows when he will manage to impress the national selectors.         
	Sreevats was a revelation on Saturday. The 20-year old, perhaps inspired by the company of former India captain Sourav Ganguly, played a patient knock, studded with eight fours.         
	He followed up his 74 in the last match with a sedate 71 on Saturday. He looked a bit edgy early on in his innings but gained in confidence with time. Souravs repeated pep talk during the change of overs implored him to play straight, and it worked wonders for him.         
	Dada was telling me about the slowness of the wicket. He repeatedly asked me to play straight and it really helped me build the innings, said Sreevats. He played a tired-looking shot and was caught at mid-wicket off Dhiraj Singh. Bengal decided to drop opener Abhisek Banerjee to accommodate Sourav.         
	Chasing 212 for victory, Bengal made a slow start and lost Wriddhiman Saha cheaply.         
	Sourav probably played his last innings for Bengal on Saturday. The former India captain ruled himself out of the next stages of the tournament, scheduled to be held in Tripura. Asked if it was his last match for Bengal, he said with a smile:  Probably yes I will probably play again if I need practice. But no more four-day matches for me.

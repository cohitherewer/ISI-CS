            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Winning the football World Cup may be a far cry for India but soccer lovers here will have a chance to catch a glimpse of the coveted trophy in April next year.         
	According to Subrata Dutta, the vice-president of the AIFF, the original World Cup trophy will be taken to different countries, including India, by one of the Fifa sponsors.         
	The trophy will stay in India for two days before being taken to Japan. On April 20, it will arrive in Delhi and the next day it will be on display in Calcutta, he said.         
	Dutta, who is currently in The Bahamas to attend the Fifa Congress, told The Telegraph that India would be one of the 86 nations where the trophy will be put on display. The last time the World Cup trophy came to India was in 2006.

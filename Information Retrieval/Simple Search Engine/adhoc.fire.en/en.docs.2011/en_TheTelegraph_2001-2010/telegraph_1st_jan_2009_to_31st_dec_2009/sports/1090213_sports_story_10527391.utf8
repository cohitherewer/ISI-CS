            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: John Buchanan, who is Brisbane-based, e-mailed his response to The Telegraph late on Thursday.               
	The following are excerpts:         
	It is very flattering of the ECB, through Hugh Morris to suggest my name, as a possibility for a role with English cricket. As you know, my business Buchanan Success Coaching is a consulting business to the corporate sector as well as sport. Some of the major delivery areas are:           The principles and practice of coaching  Building high performance teams  Managing people  Maintaining success  Gaining competitive advantage    
	With respect to sport, I have provided these consulting services to the New Zealand All Blacks, AFL football teams such as Brisbane Lions, Port Adelaide, Richmond Tigers, AIS coaches, Triathlon Australia, Netball Australia, ARU and so on.         
	I am soon travelling to New Zealand to meet the English Lions cricket team to spend time with their coaches and team.         
	In the corporate world, I have provided my coaching services to Telstra, Commonwealth Bank, NAB, HSBC, Mahindra, British Telecom, Nokia, VALE, BHP Billeton, Lend Lease, Griffiths University, KFC, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Unilever (India) amongst many others.         
	So, I am always open to the prospect of being engaged in this capacity. At this point though, I have had no formal communication from the ECB.         
	It is extremely unlikely for me to accept a full-time coaching role with the English cricket team for a number of reasons:           I finished the coaching role with CA because I believe in a shelf life for coaches, and in my opinion, I had reached mine by the completion of the World Cup in 2007. I am not sure I could travel that road again, and indeed with another country.  I am embarking on my corporate career, and a full-time coaching role would preclude these activities.   I joined the IPL in 2008 because I believe it has the capacity to change cricket, more so than any other single event in crickets history  potentially more so than the advent of Kerry Packer with World Series Cricket, more so than Bodyline, and more so than Bradman or WG Grace. I believe cricket needs change, and I want to help IPL achieve that change.  I enjoyed my time in IPL in 2008 and in particular my time with Kolkata Knight Riders, with the owners and community of Calcutta. I would like that association to continue as long as possible in order that I may help it to gradually bear the fruits that Shah Rukh Khan, Jay Mehta, Juhi Chawla and all the wonderful people associated with the franchise are working so hard to do. We are currently finalising contract negotiations.     
	I am looking forward to the 2009 IPL season which should build upon the successes of 2008, despite the current downturn in the financial climate.

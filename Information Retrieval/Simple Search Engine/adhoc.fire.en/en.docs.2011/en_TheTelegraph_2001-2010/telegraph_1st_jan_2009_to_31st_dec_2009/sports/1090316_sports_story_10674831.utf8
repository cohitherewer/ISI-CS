                                                     Moles: Not scared of Indians 
            A CORRESPONDENT            Sehwag made the difference, feels Moles                           
	Hamilton: New Zealand coach Andy Moles sounded confident on Sunday ahead of the first Test against India. Buoyed by the face-saving victory in the last ODI on Saturday, Moles said the Test series would not be a cakewalk for the Indians.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On the challenges ahead in the Test series         
	Every game is a new challenge. You face different challenges in different games. Indians have a fine track record. We know it is going to be tough but we also know that we have to start on the front foot.         
	If the win in the last ODI has restored self-belief         
	We know that India are a great side. We respect them but we are not scared of them. We showed that last night (Saturday). We got early wickets and that put them under pressure. They make mistakes like everybody else.         
	If he is happy with the team composition         
	Yes. We start practice tomorrow (Monday). John Wright and I shall sit down and have a look at the bowlers who are likely to take wickets against the Indians. After that, the final 11 will be selected.         
	On the reports that Daniel Vettori wanted Chris Martin while the selectors didnt         
	I did read some things in the papers this morning (Sunday). I can assure Martin that the selectors havent said that they didnt want him. They are strong men and if they didnt want him, he wouldnt gave been there. Martin is a fine performer and has a good track record. When he bowls at the nets tomorrow (Monday), if he is at the top of his game, he will play.         
	If the pitch will be seamer-friendly         
	We are looking forward to a fine sporting wicket and if theres good bounce, that will be great. We dont want to play on a green top. We want to have a good game of cricket and I am sure thats what well get.         
	If New Zealand will go all out in attack         
	We have been looking to stop some guys from scoring runs. Virender Sehwag has been the difference between the two sides. Not to miss Sachin Tendulkar, who scored a great 100. Unfortunately, the Indians have been able to score runs. We plan to bowl in the right areas.         
	On the presence of attacking players like Sehwag along with defensive men like Rahul Dravid         
	They have a good mix of different kind of players. Certainly, Sehwag and Co. will play as they generally do. Dravid will play the way he does. Well have to deal with each one of them differently.         
	If a performance like the one in Saturdays one-dayer would be enough to win the Test series         
	We have to realise that we need to be a lot more disciplined and we have to be a lot more patient.We have to be at our best to beat India. We havent played five-day cricket for a long time. So we have to make sure that we get those skills back.         
	If the Indian team looked over-confident         
	I dont think they were over-confident. They just played the way they play. History suggests you cant pull it off every time with that kind of cricket.         
	If his side now have the momentum         
	Cricket is all about momentum. Of course the Indians will say that they won the series. Our answer is, there have been six games of cricket. They won three, we won three. So we are level going into the series.

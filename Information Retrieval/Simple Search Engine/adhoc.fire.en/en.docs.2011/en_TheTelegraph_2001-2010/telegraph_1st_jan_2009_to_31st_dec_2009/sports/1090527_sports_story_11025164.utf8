The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan letter to AFC on Bhutia row
                                                   Bagan letter to AFC on Bhutia row
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Bhaichung Bhutia-Mohun Bagan controversy is anything but over.         
	An upset Bagan sent a letter to the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) on Tuesday in protest over the article posted on the Asian bodys website.         
	AFC, on the other hand, added a disclaimer on Tuesday, which says that the article doesnt necessarily reflect the views of the AFC.         
	The disclaimer, which was missing on Monday, implies that the AFC intends to wash its hands off the controversy.         
	Bagan, in their letter, clarified the circumstances that forced the club to show cause Bhaichung. Club secretary Anjan Mitra has said in the letter that Bhaichung faked injury (so that he did not have to play for the club in the AFC Cup tie against Kuwait SC) and participated in a dance reality show instead.         
	The letter also says that Bhaichung missed several vital practice sessions with the club without any concrete reason.         
	Bhaichung was our captain and so he had a vital role to motivate teammates and behave like a leader and inspire the youngsters. We leave it to your (AFC acting general secretary Alex Soosey) good judgement, as a senior football administrator, to ascertain whether the manner in which Bhaichung behaved is exemplary of a leader?  the letter said.

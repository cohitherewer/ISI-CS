                                                   Censure and some support 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagans decision to showcause Bhaichung Bhutia for neglecting his club duties throughout the season evoked mixed reactions among the football fraternity.         
	The following are what some of them said (in alphabetical order):         
	Dipendu Biswas: As a player, football comes first to me. From whatever I have read in the newspapers, I feel Bhaichung shouldnt have neglected his club duties. He is a footballer and he has a contract with the club. So that should be respected. All the other things should be of secondary importance for a footballer. Also important is the fact that he is an icon. So he should have been careful in his actions. But having said that, I do feel Bagan could have had a one-on-one with him and find out a solution. That would have been much better.         
	Sunil Chetri: Bhaichungbhai is one of the most important players for the country. He has served the country for so many years. Its absurd to question his commitment towards the game. He has always been very professional to the game. If the club had a problem with him, it should have been settled behind closed doors. After dedicating so many years to Indian football, its extremely unfair to insult him like this. After all, whatever the club says is arguable He should have been given a chance to place his side of the story too. This is definitely not the way to treat a player of his stature.         
	Gautam Sarkar: The discipline factor is vital. As a professional player, he is bound by the contract he has with the club. He should have respected that. Football and the club should come first because that is what has brought him such popularity. Im very fond of Bhaichung and am proud of him. But no one is above the game. But I do think the club was late in taking action. Why do you wait till you lose matches and trophies? The club authorities could have cautioned him much earlier. I feel bad for him since he is such a great player. These things never happened in our playing days. But I dont blame the club for taking such a step. He is an icon and should have been more responsible. Such a step by the club will only help in creating a professional atmosphere for the game in this country.

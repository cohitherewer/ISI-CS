The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Haddin out with injury
                                                   Haddin out with injury
                      
	Birmingham: Australias Brad Haddin was replaced in the side after the toss because he sustained a suspected broken finger on his left hand while practising.         
	Haddin had been named in the team for the third Ashes Test at Edgbaston.         
	Australia sought special dispensation from England captain Andrew Strauss and coach Andy Flower to replace Haddin with reserve wicketkeeper Graham Manou, which was given. Haddin went to hospital for scan.         
	Although it was after the team had been submitted and technically England could have opposed Ponting, they agreed and it was approved by the match referee. (AP)

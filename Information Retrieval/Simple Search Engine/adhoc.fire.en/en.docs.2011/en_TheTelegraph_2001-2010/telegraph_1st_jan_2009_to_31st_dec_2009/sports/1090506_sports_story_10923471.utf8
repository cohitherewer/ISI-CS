The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I made Kumble captain: Mallya
                                                   I made Kumble captain: Mallya
                      
	Johannesburg: Liquor baron Vijay Mallya, the owner of the Royal Challengers Bangalore said it was his decision to hand over the captaincy to Anil Kumble following regular skipper Kevin Pietersens exit for national duty.         
	Under Kumble, the Bangalore team saw a change in their fortunes, winning three matches on the trot, and Mallya felt his decision to appoint a new skipper had paid dividends.         
	Obviously, it was my decision. As a team owner I decide. But it was no last-minute decision, Mallya said. Enthused by the teams improved show, Mallya claimed the team had the potential to win the second IPL.         
	All I can say is, we have the talent and determination to play well and if that takes us to winning this tournament, then I will be the happiest man in the world, said Mallya.         
	With three wins on the trot, the Royal Challengers are on song and Mallya felt it would be unwise to write anyone off.         
	Dont underestimate those who are losing. Even the teams that have been winning all their games will lose as the law of averages will come into play., he told the IPLs official website.           (PTI)

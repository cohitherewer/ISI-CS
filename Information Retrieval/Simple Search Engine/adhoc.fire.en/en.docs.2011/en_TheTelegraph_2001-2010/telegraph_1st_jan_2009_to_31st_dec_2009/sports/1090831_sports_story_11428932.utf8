                                                   SL close in on the top spot
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sri Lanka have narrowed the gap with top-ranked South Africa to just two points in the Reliance Mobile ICC Test Championship after winning the two-Test series against New Zealand in Colombo on Sunday.         
	Sri Lankas series win has earned them a crucial ratings point which has put them on 120 points  just two behind South Africa and one ahead of third-placed India, according to an ICC release. Six ratings points now separate the Proteas from fourth-placed Australia.         
	This gives both India and Sri Lanka a shot at the No.1 spot. While Sri Lanka will need to win the series against India to top the table, India will have to win 2-0 to topple South Africa.         
	Rankings         
	1. South Africa (122), 2. Sri Lanka (120), 3. India (119), 4. Australia (116), 5. England (105), 6. Pakistan (84), 7. New Zealand (80), 8. West Indies (76), 9. Bangladesh (13).

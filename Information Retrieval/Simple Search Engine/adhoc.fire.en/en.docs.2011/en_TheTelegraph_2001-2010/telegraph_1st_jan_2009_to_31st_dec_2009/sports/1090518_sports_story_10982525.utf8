The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhaichung uncertain 
                                                   Bhaichung uncertain 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan officials did not make it clear on Sunday if Bhaichung will be allowed to play the AFC Cup match against Al Karamah at the Howrah Stadium on Tuesday. Bhutia, who returned to the city late on Sunday, is yet to reply to the clubs showcause notice.         
	The club officials said that they expect a reply in the next 48 hours.         
	Meanwhile, Al Karamah coach Mohammed Kwid said on Sunday that they are not taking Mohun Bagan lightly despite the city giants poor run in the AFC Cup.         
	The green-and-maroon brigade have lost all the five matches they have played so far, conceding 15 goals, and are out of contention for the next stage. Even though the match is inconsequential for Mohun Bagan, a win would earn the Syrian side a last-16 berth.         
	We have to win the match at any cost and well give it our best shot. Only a win can take us through to the next round, Kwid said, after the first practice session on Sunday.         
	They have a very good, tactful coach. I believe he (Bencharifa) the national league (I-League) was his priority. So their performance in AFC has not been up to the mark. Kwid said. However, we cannot take them lightly. Its a home match for them (Mohun Bagan) and as they have no chance of progressing to the next stage, the pressure will not be on them. We have to tread carefully.         
	He said Mohun Bagan have three good players in Marcos Pereira, Lalkamal Bhowmick and Ishfaq Ahmed.         
	Al Karamah boast of two foreign and three international players. Their Cameroonian defender Richard Etiegie scored in the fifth minute of the stoppage time to give Al Karamah a thrilling 2-1 victory over Group D leaders Kuwait SC in their last AFC Cup encounter.         
	Al Karamah have nine points at the moment, while Kuwait SC and Al Wehdat, who take on each other in the other match on Tuesday, are on 10 points each.

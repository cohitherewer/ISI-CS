The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tough task ahead of Challengers
                                                   Tough task ahead of Challengers
                      
	Durban: The Chennai Super Kings, under the leadership of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, will have to guard against stepping on the banana skin when they take on the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League (IPL) here Thursday.         
	Dhonis men did not exactly have a rollicking start to their IPL campaign, winning just one of their first five matches.         
	The win against the Deccan Chargers, however, marked the beginning of their spectacular five-match winning streak and Anil Kumbles men would require something extraordinary Thursday to halt the Super Kings juggernaut.         
	Matthew Hayden has been the key to the Super Kings success with his characteristic power-hitting that has often given the side a flying start, making the most of the first six overs.         
	The Super Kings bowlers have bent their backs even when their batsmen have faltered and that is why they have won six of the 10 matches they have played so far.         
	For them, Sudeep Tyagi and Laxmipathy Balaji have done a decent job so far, while Muttiah Muralidharan has been both among the wickets and unplayable. (PTI)

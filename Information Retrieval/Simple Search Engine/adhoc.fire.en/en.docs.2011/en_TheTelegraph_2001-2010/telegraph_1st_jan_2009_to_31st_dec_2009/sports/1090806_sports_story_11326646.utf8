The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vijender backs Wada code
                                                   Vijender backs Wada code
                      
	Mumbai: Beijing Olympic bronze medal-winning pugilist Vijender Singh supported World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada)s much-debated whereabouts clause that has been rejected by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), and said that he faced no problems in complying with it.         
	We (boxers) had signed the clause some 6-7 years ago. Abhi tak Wada se koi panga nahi hua hain (Till now we have not faced any problems with Wada), Vijender said.         
	Cricketers know best about their worries, but I have not lost my freedom till now, he said.         
	Olympic bronze medallist wrestler Sushil Kumar echoed Vijender as he advised the countrys cricketers to cast aside their concerns on breach of privacy and security threats and accept the Wadas whereabouts clause without any reservation.         
	Why are the cricketers worrying so much? The worries of cricketers about infringement of privacy and possible security threat are not justified. I am also a signatory to Wadas clauses and strictly adhere to its rules and regulations, Sushil said.         
	However, Indian tennis sensation Somdev Dev Varman has endorsed the cricketers stance saying that the Wada code is impractical and intrusive.         
	Its not practical at all. I would like to have my privacy. If Wada would like to test athletes then they should give a days advance notice because honestly, I dont really know my schedule for the next day normally, so how can I inform someone else about it, Somdev said.

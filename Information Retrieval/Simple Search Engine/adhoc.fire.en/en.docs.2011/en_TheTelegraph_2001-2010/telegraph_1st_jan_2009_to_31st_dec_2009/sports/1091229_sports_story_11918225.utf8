                                                                                                                       7                                        Bhutia wants to win Cup
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Bhaichung Bhutia on Monday.                           
	Guwahati: Bhaichung Bhutia is firmly focussed on helping his side win the Hero Honda 31st Federation Cup title rather than basking in the glory of being the all-time highest scorer of the coveted meet.         
	On Sunday, coming on a substitute the East Bengal striker netted the winner against JCT in Silchar  his 26 th in the Federation Cup  and saw his team setting up a mouth watering clash with Mohun Bagan.         
	Bhutia reached the town on Monday morning and straightaway was at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium with his teammates.         
	It is always nice to see your name in the scoresheet. But I will be very happy if I see my team winning the title this time, the India skipper said.         
	Talking about the year-end clash with Bagan, Bhutia said: It is going to be a good match because they are a good side. (Jose) Barreto and Chidi (Edeh) are well in tandem. But our boys are also playing well and we wont give up withput a fight, he said.         
	Bhutia also had a word of praise for Lajong FC and said the Shillong side has the potential to make it big in Indian football.         
	It is a good sign for football in the Northeast that a team team like Lajong has come up and doing so well. I feel the Meghalaya government should come forward to help the club, in particular, and football in general, so that the game can grow.         
	I am told that Lajong do not have a proper ground for practice. The government could help them in that aspect, the Sikkimese Sniper said.         
	Bhutia also felt that the Federation Cup would give a major boost to the development of the game in the Northeast and the state governments should join hands to help the game grow. We must not forget that Northeast has the best footballing talent in the country, he signed off.

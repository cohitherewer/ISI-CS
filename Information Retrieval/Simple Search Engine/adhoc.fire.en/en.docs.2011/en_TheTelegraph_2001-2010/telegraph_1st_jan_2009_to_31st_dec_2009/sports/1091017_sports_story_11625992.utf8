	Shanghai: Top seed Rafael Nadal moved into the semi-finals of the Shanghai Masters on Friday when Ivan Ljubicic became the eighth player to retire from the $3.24m tournament.         
	The Spanish world No. 2 had just evened the match up at 3-6, 6-3 when 30-year-old Ljubicic, who had already had treatment on his left thigh, decided he could no longer continue.         
	Nadal, who lost to another big-serving Croatian in Marin Cilic at the China Open last week, will face compatriot Feliciano Lopez on Saturday, hoping to reach his first final since knee and abdominal injuries disrupted his season.         
	Second seed Novak Djokovic earlier came through a tough test of his nerve at the hands of Gilles Simon to set up a semi-final against sixth seed Nikolay Davydenko with a 6-3, 2-6, 6-2 victory.         
	The 22-year-old Djokovic, chasing a third successive title in China after last years Masters Cup triumph and last weeks victory in Beijing, needed to show real mental strength in a frenetic third set against the French hustler.         
	I had no chance. He played very good baseline, Davydenko said.         
	Spains Feliciano Lopez upset ninth seed Robin Soderling 7-6, 6-3 to reach his first semi-final of the season.         
	Meanwhile, it was heartbreak for Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles at the Shanghai Masters on Friday as the doubles heavyweights lost their semi-final encounter against Julien Benneteau and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.         
	The Indo-Bahamian pair lost 6-7(2-7), 2-6 to the French duo, the loss coming a day after their hard-earned 4-6, 6-3, 10-5 quarter final victory over Lukasz Kubot and Oliver Marach.         
	The Frenchmen sent down seven aces as opposed to the one by Mahesh and Mark. They also had a better percentage of first and second service winners.           (AGENCIES)

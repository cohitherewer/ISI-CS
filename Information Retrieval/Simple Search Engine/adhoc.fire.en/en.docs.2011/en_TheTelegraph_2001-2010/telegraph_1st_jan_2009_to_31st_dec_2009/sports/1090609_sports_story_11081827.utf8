The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods gears up for the US Open 
                                                   Woods gears up for the US Open 
                      
	Dublin: Tiger Woods sounded an ominous warning to his rivals for this months US Open in New York with a vintage display in winning the Memorial tournament by one shot on Sunday.         
	The American world No. 1 clinched the title for a record fourth time, hitting every fairway at Muirfield Village Golf Club in the final round before clinching his 67th PGA Tour victory with a superb seven-under-par 65.         
	It was his second title this year in seven starts on the US circuit and silenced critics who had argued Woods was not back to his best after being sidelined for eight months while recovering from reconstructive knee surgery.         
	The US Open will be held from June 18-21 at Bethpages Black Course in New York where Woods will start as the overwhelming favourite.         
	It was nice to play this well going into the US Open, a smiling Woods told reporters after shooting the best score in the final round by two shots.         
	This is how you have to hit it in order to win US Opens, especially Bethpage.         
	That golf course is as big as they come. You have to hit the ball well all week. I did that in 2002, and that was one of the reasons why I was up there.           (REUTERS)

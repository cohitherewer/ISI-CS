	Nice: World champion Viswanathan Anand suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Norwegian prodigy Magnus Carlsen and went down 0.5-1.5 in the third round of the Amber blindfold and rapid chess tournament here.         
	Anand lost the blindfold game with white pieces and did not get a chance to recover in the rapid. With this defeat, the Indian slipped in the standings and stands joint sixth in combined, joint fifth in rapid and joint sixth in blindfold.         
	Alexander Morozevich of Russia and Levon Aronian of Armenia retained the joint first position in the combined standings after settling for a 1-1 draw with Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan and Gata Kamsky of the US, respectively. While Morozevich signed peace in both games against Radjabov, Aronian and Kamsky shared a win each to reach the tied score.

                                                   Andhra official faces arrest
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hyderabad: Andhra Pradesh police are likely to arrest Vankenna Chamundeshwaranath, the manager of Team India during the recent World T20, for alleged acts of financial impropriety and harassment of women cricketers.         
	Vijayawada police Monday recorded the statements of 17 women cricketers who had made accusations against the former Andhra Cricket Association (ACA) secretary in the media.         
	On June 20, the ACA president Gokaraju Gangaraju suspended Chamundeshwaranath over the allegations. The former cricketer, however, denied the charges.         
	Two weeks ago, a nine-member women cricketers delegation called on the state home minister, Sabita Indra Reddy, and submitted a petition demanding action against Chamundeshwaranath.The home minister appointed an enquiry commission, led by a senior police official, to look into the charges.         
	Chamundeshwaranath has brought a lot of embarrassment to the state and the parent cricket association, she said after receiving the report from the commission, which confirmed the charges.         
	(Chamundeshwaranath) used to send text messages to women cricketers around 3am asking them to call back if they were alone. He would also ask players to hug him for any achievement. A simple Thank you wouldnt do for him. Such things took place on several occasions, said one of the women cricketers.         
	Vijayawada police said they were preparing a case under section 354 of the IPC.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United edge past Bolton
                                                   United edge past Bolton
                      
	London: Manchester United went top of the Premier League with a 2-1 home win over Bolton Wanderers on Saturday as Chelsea went down 2-1 at Aston Villa and Liverpool lost at Sunderland to a goal that went in off a beach ball.         
	Arsenal continued to bang in the goals with a 3-1 home victory over Birmingham City while Tottenham Hotspur survived a 60th-minute red card for Jermain Defoe to secure a 2-1 win at Portsmouth.         
	Champions United lead the way with 22 points from nine games. Chelsea are second on 21, Spurs have 19 and Arsenal have a game in hand on 18 points.         
	United needed a last-minute own goal to salvage a 2-2 home draw with Sunderland in their last league game and it was another own goal that put them ahead on Saturday as Zat Knights attempted clearance flew in after five minutes.         
	The home team looked too good for their Lancashire rivals in the first half and the second goal came after 33 minutes when Antonio Valencia fired his first for the club since his close-season move from Wigan.         
	Some loose defending allowed Matt Taylor to pull one back for Bolton after 75 minutes and set up a nervous finale for the United fans.         
	Liverpools hopes of a first title in 20 years already look slim after a fourth defeat in nine league games, though they were furious Sunderlands controversial goal stood.         
	The key moment came after five minutes when Darren Bents shot cannoned in off a loose beach ball which had Liverpool written on it.         
	The visitors, without the injured Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres, complained but Bent was happy to claim his sixth goal in five games.         
	Former FIFA referee Graham Poll said that according to the laws, play should have been stopped and a drop ball given.         
	If thats the case then weve got away with one, Sunderland manager Steve Bruce said.         
	Bent said: The beach ball was sitting there in their six-yard box so if they leave it there they pay the penalty. (Reuters)

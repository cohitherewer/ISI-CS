The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Button pips Vettel to take pole position 
                                                     Button pips Vettel to take pole position 
                                
	Barcelona: Championship leader Jenson Button snatched a last-gasp pole position for the Spanish Formula One Grand Prix from Red Bulls Sebastian Vettel on Saturday.         
	The Briton now has a good chance to take his fourth victory in five races, knowing the driver on pole has won in Barcelona for the past eight years and 13 times in the past 14 at the Circuit de Catalunya.         
	It could have gone very, very wrong ... I think I just got across the line with a couple of seconds to spare, more luck than judgement, said the Brawn GP driver, who only just made it to the line to start his final flying lap before the session closed.         
	Its a little bit of a surprise to be on pole.         
	Force India drivers Adrian Sutil and Giancarlo Fisichella will start at the back of the grid after finishing 19th and 20th respectively. Sutil recorded a 1min 21.742 lap at the end of first qualifying session, an improvement of 0.5secs over the morning practice time, to finish 19th.         
	Germanys Vettel, the only other driver to have won this season, may find he has more fuel on board than the Briton when the weights are published later but he was still disappointed. I would have wished to have the pole but at the last minute he took it away, he said.         
	Buttons teammate Rubens Barrichello qualified third, with Felipe Massa alongside on an all-Brazilian second row for revived champions Ferrari.         
	Button, who has a 12-point lead over Barrichello, won from pole in Australia and Malaysia but had not qualified in the top three for the past two races. Saturdays was the sixth pole of his career.         
	Australian Mark Webber was fifth for Red Bull, Mercedes-powered Brawns closest rivals, just ahead of the Toyotas of Timo Glock and Jarno Trulli.         
	Spains double world champion Fernando Alonso will start eighth for Renault in a disappointment for the locals, who have turned out in smaller numbers so far this weekend in a reflection of his reduced pulling power. Massa showed that Ferraris aerodynamic upgrade had put them a step closer to the leaders and he will also get a boost at the start from the KERS energy recovery system that the cars ahead of him do not have.         
	Button worried that could cause problems.         
	When one car is coming at the first corner a lot quicker than the others in front of him, it could cause mayhem, he said. Especially with quite a high-speed corner like this one.         
	Massas teammate Kimi Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion who won in Barcelona last year, qualified only 16th after an error shared by team and driver.         
	Thinking that he had done a quick enough time to get through to the second stage (Q2) of qualifying, the Finn passed up the chance to do one more flying lap. He was wrong, others went faster and he was eliminated.         
	We made a stupid mistake ... we thought my best time would be enough to make it to Q2 and so I stayed in the garage. Theres no point in saying whose fault it was, because we cant do anything about it now, said Raikkonen.         
	McLaren also had a dismal day with Britains world champion Lewis Hamilton 14th, his worst performance to date in dry conditions, and teammate Heikki Kovalainen 18th.

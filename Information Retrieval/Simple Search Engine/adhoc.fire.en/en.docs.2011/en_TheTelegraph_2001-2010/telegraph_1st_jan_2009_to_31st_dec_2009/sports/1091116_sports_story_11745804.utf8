The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Djokovic masters Paris
                                                                                                                                   Djokovic masters Paris
                      
	Paris: Third-seeded Novak Djokovic scrambled to a 6-2, 5-7, 7-6 (7-3) victory over local favorite Gael Monfils to win his maiden Paris Masters on Sunday. The 22-year-old Serbian survived a 2 hours and 43 minutes battle to win back-to-back ATP titles after defeating top-ranked Roger Federer at the Swiss Indoors final last Sunday.         
	Djokovic looked set for a comfortable triumph after winning the first set in just half an hour, but then struggled physically to stay at the same level.         
	It was unbelievably difficult, said the World No. 3, who has won a record 76 matches on the tour this season and claimed his first Masters 1000 tournament of the year following four defeats in finals.         
	Gael was very unpredictable and he was hitting the ball very good. Djokovic, who will defend his title at the eight-man ATP World Tour Finals from Nov. 22-29 in London, extended his perfect record against Monfils to 4-0.         
	The former Australian Open winner fell on his knees and screamed on the centre court when Monfils  who was chasing his third career title  doublefaulted on Djokovics first match point.         
	Djokovic, who earned his 16th career title, broke in the fourth game of the first set when Monfils missed two consecutive forehands.         
	Losing only three points on his serve in the first set, Djokovic pumped his fist went he took a 5-2 lead with a forehand winner down the line. He won the set in the next game when Monfils made his first double fault. Monfils was broken for the second time in a row when Djokovic opened up a 2-0 lead in the second set with a passing shot at his opponents feet.         
	But Djokovic  who made 21 unforced errors in the second set  suddenly lost the momentum and Monfils finally gave his supporters something to cheer by converting his first break point of the match in the fifth game after Djokovic missed an easy backhand volley.         
	Monfils then leveled at 3-3 and kept the pressure on Djokovic, failing to convert three other chances to break before taking the Serbs service with a return winner for a decisive 6-5 lead. In the final set, Djokovic outpaced Monfils with a forehand winner to conclude a long rally in the second game, only to lose his serve immediately.

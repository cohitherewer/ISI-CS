The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Luxembourg event is Bindras comeback 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Luxembourg event is Bindras comeback 
  - Back home for NRAI trials, champion told theyve been put off!       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Abhinav Bindra                                 
	Chandigarh: Ace shooter Abhinav Bindra, Indias only individual gold medallist in the Olympics, returns to competitive action in an invitational event in Luxembourg, on December 18-19.         
	Bindra, who scripted a momentous first in August 2008, has been off competitions since then.         
	I wanted the urge to compete again to come from within... Wanted my inner voice to lead me... It did and, today, Im just days away from an event, the RIAC Invitational, Bindra told The Telegraph at his sprawling and classy residence, Bindra Farm, off the Zirakpur-Patiala road.         
	Speaking before leaving for Mumbai, to attend a wedding, he added: I took to the sport in 1994-95... Never before have I had such a long break (16 months), so I dont know how Ill react when I position myself for the first shot... Actually, its going to be a new adventure...         
	If Im to take a realistic view, Ill probably need three-four events to get into groove... The idea is to get back into the competitive mould, winning would be next... Winning or losing in the first few events wont be affecting me... Ill only be giving myself tick marks.         
	Bindra, in fact, was training overseas when he was asked by the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) to present himself for trials in December. On returning home, he was informed theyve been put off!         
	That sure speaks volumes for the professionalism of the NRAI, which doesnt seem happy with the 27-year-olds awesome achievement.         
	Not surprisingly, being the gentleman that he is, Bindra declined to comment on the NRAIs behaviour.         
	Bindra, of course, laughed when it was pointed out that his favourite cricketer, Sachin Tendulkar, would never have to prove himself in a trial match.         
	Significantly, Bindra is the reigning world champion in the 10m rifle, too.         
	Bindra intends spending the next two months in Europe and, while he hasnt finalised all the events hell be competing in, the one in Munich (in January) definitely wont be missed.         
	Thats because the World Championship, in August, is going to be at the same facility and it will be nice to get a feel of that venue, he explained.         
	Simply put, thats being professional with a capital P.         
	Bindra, it may be recalled, has not one but two shooting ranges at his residence. The 10m is indoors, while the 50m is outdoors.         
	The private facility houses a small workshop, as he put it, as well. Everything there is neatly laid out.         
	While Bindras break has, indeed, been long, he has used a part of the period to work towards trying to reach the next level.         
	Ive been training my brain, so to say, and its to be seen how effective working with a machine has been... Id like to think that my recent sessions with (Chelsea psychologist) Tim Harkness have been beneficial, Bindra said.         
	[That he was working with Harkness was reported in these columns on October 23.]         
	Smiling, Bindra added: One has to find ways to at least match, if not move ahead, of the techniques being adopted by the big names... Trying to get better is a continuous process, thats my belief...         
	His living room, by the way, has an addition: A custom-made showcase where the Beijing gold medal finds pride of place. Also on display there are his jacket label (No. 1334) and, this is mind-blowing, a golden replica of the history-creating 10m Walther rifle.         
	In a wonderful gesture, the iconic German manufacturer made the presentation to Bindra soon after the Beijing Olympics. That, among other things, showed respect towards a champion.         
	How about some respect from the NRAI?

                                                   Need to do our best, says Bhajji
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: India might not be playing enough Tests but Harbhajan Singh feels the team should try to do their best whenever the opportunity arises, instead of worrying about capturing the No.1 spot in the world.         
	There is a scramble for the top position in Test rankings in the wake of Australias Ashes defeat and their dropping to the fourth spot, but Indias chances of snatching the top spot might suffer as they are playing only six Tests this year.         
	The Punjab off-spinner, however, said that the team should look to make the most of what they could, without bothering about the schedule.         
	I, or any player for that matter, would like to play 12-15 Tests a year. What we can do is try our best to knock off the opponents 3-0 and get maximum points, but we cant do any thing about the fixtures. We should not worry about that, Harbhajan, in the city on a promotional visit, said on Tuesday.         
	On the ODI series against Australia at home later this year, the bowler sounded very confident.         
	They (Australia) are my favourite team. I hope we can beat them 5-2 or 6-1. Australia have long been on top but we have done well against them over the last four years, Harbhajan said.

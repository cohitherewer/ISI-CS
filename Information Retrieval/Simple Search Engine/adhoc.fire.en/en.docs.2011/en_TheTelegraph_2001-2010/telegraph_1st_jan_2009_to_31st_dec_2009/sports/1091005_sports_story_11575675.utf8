The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | My most enjoyable Trophy: Ricky
                                                   My most enjoyable Trophy: Ricky
                      
	Ricky Ponting, the Australia captain, spoke to the media in Centurion on Sunday afternoon.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Whether or not youre expected to win, its always satisfying to do so... Weve been playing very well and even if the experts expected us to finish third or fourth, Ive always had high expectations from the team... We did have a glitch against Pakistan (before winning on the last ball)...         
	Its a fact that we didnt start the Champions Trophy as favourites, but that England  a team we (recently) beat 6-1  made the semi-finals and lost to us, shows how well weve been playing...         
	Were very excited at what tomorrow could hold... Ill be telling the guys not to get carried away by the size of the occasion... Personally, this has been the most enjoyable Champions Trophy... Some of us have been on the road for five months (beginning with the World T20) and it would be nice to put some icing on the cake...         
	I didnt watch the second semi-final very closely... Im not a huge watcher of cricket, at least not on an day off! Theres not much of a difference between the teams (New Zealand, Pakistan), but Pakistan tend to be hot and cold...         
	The players and administrators have done a great job of showcasing the 50-over game... The good thing is that we didnt have irrelevant matches...           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT IN JOHANNESBURG

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bowlers get the blame
                                                   Bowlers get the blame
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Agartala: Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla was visibly upset after his sides loss in the Vijay Hazare Trophy final for the second straight season and said he was unhappy with the performance of the bowlers in Mondays final.         
	Im very disappointed. Losing the final is becoming a routine for us, Shukla said after the match at the Maharaja Bir Bikram Stadium here. Im not happy with the performance of the bowlers. 285 is very difficult to chase on any wicket. We didnt bowl well.         
	He picked up Manoj Tiwary for special praise and said that the other batsmen needed to support him.         
	Asked if his run out was the turning point of the match, Shukla quipped: Ya, actually you may say so. Our start was not good, but we made a comeback. my partnership with Manoj was vital for us. But it was a misunderstanding.         
	He defended his decision of not bowling out left-arm spinner Iresh Saxena.         
	Two left-handers were at the crease at that point of time. So I thought it would be easier for them to play left-arm spin, the 27-year all-rounder said.         
	Tamil Nadu captain R. Ashwin said that the game was won by his team after they posted a 280-plus total batting first.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indian challenge over
                                                   Indian challenge over
                      
	Indian Wells: Indian challenge came to an end after Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi lost their respective second round doubles matches in the ATP event on Monday.         
	Paes and his Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy, seeded fourth, went down 6-7 (6), 6-7 (5) to Argentines Juan Martin del Potro and David Nalbandian.         
	The third seeded pair of Bhupathi and Mark Knowles of the Bahamas were stunned 6-7 (2), 4-6 by the unseeded Israeli-Belarussian duo of Max Mirnyi and Andy Ram.         
	The twin losses rounded off a disappointing Indian campaign at the hard court event, where Sania Mirza couldnt get past the second round in singles and crashed out of doubles in the first round.         
	Roger Federer, meanwhile, felled big-serving Croat Ivo Karlovic 7-6, 6-3 to reach the fourth round.         
	Fourth seed Andy Murray and No. 10 Fernando Verdasco also moved into the last 16 but there were shock defeats for Frenchmen Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Gilles Simon.           (AGENCIES)

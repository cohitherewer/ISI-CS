	Basel: World No.1 Roger Federer, playing his first match for six weeks, beat qualifier Olivier Rochus in straight sets Monday to open his defence of the Swiss Indoors ATP title.         
	Federer, who has not played since the Davis Cup world group playoff against Italy in September, won 6-3, 6-4 against the world No.61 from Belgium.         
	One service break in each set was enough for Federer, who was playing in front of his home crowd at a tournament where he was once a ball boy and which he has won for the last three years running.         
	The Swiss, who suffered a stunning defeat to Juan Martin del Potro in the US Open final, has opted to rest since then, pulling out of two ATP tournaments.         
	Federer, who maintained a 100 per cent record in seven meetings with Rochus, looked fresh although the Belgian held his own until he was broken in the sixth game.         
	I was eager to come out and play again and it was a good match for me, Federer told reporters.         
	It was nice to come back at a home tournament where I have so many memories. It was a nice start. I thought I served well at the key moments. He got the better of me off the baseline, but I tried to stay aggressive.         
	The conditions here were quick, with the heat of the crowd, and Ill have to get used to that. I always try to have an off-season within the season, he added.         
	Its not so easy to do because I like to play as much as possible but the joy is even greater when you come back off a break.         
	Federer will face Italys Andreas Seppi in the next round due to be played Thursday.         
	Federer, meanwhile, will play an extra clay-court tournament next year to prepare for his defense of the French Open title.         
	The top-ranked Swiss intends to play 19 events in 2010, according to a playing schedule published Tuesday on his personal website.         
	Federer has added the Estoril Open in Portugal next May, which he won in 2008 but skipped this year.         
	After the week off, he won the Madrid Masters on clay before triumphing at Roland Garros for the first time.         
	Federer has cut the Japan Open from his schedule next October.         
	He also is expected to lead Switzerlands quest for a first Davis Cup title.           (AGENCIES)

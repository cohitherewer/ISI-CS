                                                                                                               IN THE CITY
                  
	 The Calcutta Football League is yet to start  a press conference is slated for Wednesday to announce the kick-off  but already there is a controversy. The Indian Football Association (IFA) has announced this seasons CFL will be a 16-team affair and not 17 since the Indian Air Force (IAF) have pulled out of the League citing their inability to field a team.       
	But IAF sources said that they never pulled out and just wanted some days to settle their house in order. We wrote a letter seeking some time. We were practising for the last six months and never knew when the League would start. We asked for some monetary help to keep our flock together but was refused. Then League rule states that teams should have under-19 players but our recruitment starts after that level, the source said.      
	Its totally false that we have pulled out. Never, the source added.                
	 Yousef Mezyan, a Palestinian central defender who also played in Lebanon, will reach the city on Sunday for trails at Mohun Bagan.       
	The former National League champions, who had a bad start in the ongoing I-League will get a boost if the tall Mezyan passes the test. His resume claims that the 31-year-old international has made 17 appearances for the national team since 2000.

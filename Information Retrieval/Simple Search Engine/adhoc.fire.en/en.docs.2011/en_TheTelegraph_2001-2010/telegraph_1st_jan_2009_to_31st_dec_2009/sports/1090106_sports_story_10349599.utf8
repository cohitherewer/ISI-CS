	Calcutta: Kapil Dev, one of three Indians in the International Cricket Councils Hall of Fame, turns 50 on Tuesday. Hours away from his half-century, Indias solitary World Cup-winning captain spoke to The Telegraph from Delhi.               
	The following are excerpts:         
	Q Where will you be on Tuesday?         
	A In good old Delhi, dont have plans to go anywhere.         
	Celebrations?         
	Ill largely be at home (Sundar Nagar), with those closest to me... As for the celebrations, its on hold till January 16, my daughter Amiyas birthday... Generally, we have a party together... She enters the teens this year and, so, her upcoming birthday is quite special for the family.         
	Is 50 just a number or...         
	(Laughs) One cant feel old in a day or overnight! I guess Ill have to look at other 50-year-olds to realise Im in the same club.         
	How different will this landmark be?         
	Look, there cant be a comparison with anything you do in cricket... I had a beautiful career... Those 17 years were special, very fulfilling... Since retirement (late 1994), Ive felt contended in the other things that Ive done... God has been kind.         
	Best moment?         
	Making my India debut (October 1978, in Pakistan)... After that would be captaining India to the (1983) World Cup win and becoming the world record-holder (February 1994, highest wicket-taker in Tests)... Outside cricket, Id pick my marriage (to Romi, in 1981) and Amiyas birth 15 years later... I feel complete and wouldnt complain if God gave me the same life all over again... Yes, there have been what one could say mishaps... I wouldnt like to go into details, but if some things dont happen, then you probably wont be able to appreciate the value of life.         
	Any regrets?         
	Perhaps that my father (Ramlal) couldnt see me with the India cap... He died a few years before I got picked... Nothing else, really...         
	Whats left to achieve?         
	(After a pause) Its difficult to talk of a goal but, yes, Id like to continue being a good citizen... Contribute in whatever way I can.         
	The last one: Message for fans...         
	Thanks for your support... I believe good wishes make a difference and, so far, Ive been blessed.

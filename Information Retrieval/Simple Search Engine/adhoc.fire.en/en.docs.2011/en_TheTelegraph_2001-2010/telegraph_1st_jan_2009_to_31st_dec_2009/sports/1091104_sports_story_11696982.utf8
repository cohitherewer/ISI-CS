                                                                                                                                     Ranadeb: Glad   to help team
  - Ranji tie vs maharashtra       A STAFF REPORTER            Ranadeb Bose                                       
	Calcutta: The national selectors keep ignoring Ranadeb Bose though the lion-hearted pacer from Bengal continues to make one impact-making performance after another in the domestic circuit.         
	His latest came Tuesday when he single-handedly wiped off the Maharashtra top order in their Ranji Trophy Super League encounter in Pune grabbing five for 67 and reducing the hosts to 179 in their first innings.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph Tuesday evening, Ranadeb expressed satisfaction with his effort but reminded that he was well supported by the other bowlers.         
	I enjoyed bowling today (Tuesday) It was a good batting wicket and Im glad to have helped the teams cause taking five wickets, Ranadeb said.         
	But it was actually a good team effort that helped us in restricting Maharashtra at 179. (Ashok) Dinda (3/65) bowled really well and then Shibsagar (Singh) chipped in with two crucial wickets. We bowled as a unit and fielded well too That helped me as a bowler, he added.         
	The effort left Ranadeb so drained that he dozed off while watching television around 8pm. It was a couple of hours later that the teams senior pro, Deep Dasgupta, woke him up and suggested he at least have something for dinner!         
	Ranadeb, who was called up for national duty in 2006-07 Indias tour for England on the back of an exceptional domestic season, however, preferred to keep a low key as he said: There will be days when I will perform while sometimes I may not be successful So, Im just happy for the days performance.         
	Speaking about their opponents, he said: Its difficult for me to judge them. I can only speak about my performance. But they are a good side and may put up a better show in the second innings.

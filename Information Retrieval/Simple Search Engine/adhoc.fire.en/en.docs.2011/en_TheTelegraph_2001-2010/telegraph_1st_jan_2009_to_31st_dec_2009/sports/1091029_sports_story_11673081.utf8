The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan look to take it higher
                                                     Bagan look to take it higher
            A STAFF REPORTER            Edeh Chidi                           
	Calcutta: On a high after banging five goals against East Bengal, a confident Mohun Bagan take on Lajong FC in Shillong in the I-League on Thursday. But, then, Bagan have a battle at hand. Backed by a vociferous 25,000-strong crowd Lajong at home are no pushovers. Ask Air India coach Bimal Gosh and his band of boys and they will vouch for it.         
	Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa though said his boys are ready to face the hostile crowd. Its okay. The crowd will always support the home team.         
	We are coming from a match that saw around one lakh spectators and at least 40,000 were shouting against us. So, the crowd is not a problem, he said from Shillong on Wednesday.         
	The Moroccan, however, said that the ground was not up to the mark.         
	I am not complaining though, he said.         
	Bagan will welcome back Deepak Mondal, who missed the derby dhamaka with a two-match suspension.         
	Yeah, Deepak will be back but we wont have N. Mohanraj and Jose Ramirez Barreto.         
	Its a strange thing, one comes in two go out. I dont know when we will get the full eleven.         
	Team sources said Edeh Chidi is still complaining of an ankle injury but will play though the pain.         
	And Sangram Mukherjee may start in place of Shilton Paul. Shilton let in three soft goals last Sunday.         
	Lajong FC coach Stanley Rozario however refused to buy the view that Bagan enjoy a slight edge.         
	If they are coming from a 5-3 win, we are also on a high after our 3-0 victory over Air India. And then we have the crowd support It will not be that easy for Bagan, he said.         
	Bagans weakness has always been setpiece moves. Somehow the team havent been able to organise themselves when it comes to setpieces.         
	And Lajong will surely try to exploit that. Lajong will be missing goalkeeper Gumpe Rime with a double yellow.

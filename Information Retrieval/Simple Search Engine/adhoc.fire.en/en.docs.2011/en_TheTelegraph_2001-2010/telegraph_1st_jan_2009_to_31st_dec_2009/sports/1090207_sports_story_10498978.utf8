The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sporting coach sacked
                                                   Sporting coach sacked
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sporting Clube de Goa coach Vishwas Gaonkar was asked to resign immediately after losing the I-League match and the top spot to Mohun Bagan Friday.         
	The vice-president called me up to say president Peter Vaz has asked me to resign. Ive met the players and have told them that Ive resigned, Gaonkar said.         
	It has been learnt that Clifford Chukwama would replace Gaonkar. Club sources said that the management was not happy with the teams performance as they have lost six of their nine matches.         
	Gaonkar expressed unhappiness over the refereeing of the match Friday His decisions were always going against us, he told reporters after the match.         
	Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa was all praise for Bhaichung. We could score that goal only because we have a great character in our team (like Bhaichung). Only he can score goals like that, the coach said.         
	Refusing to regard this win as the title-clinching one, Karim said: Im more satisfied that weve not conceded a goal for the sixth match on the trot. The achievement is just too good.         
	If you study league tables all over the world, youll find that the teams who score more goals do not necessarily win. Defending well is the key to winning a title, said the Bagan coach.

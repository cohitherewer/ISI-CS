	Paris: Novak Djokovic reached the final of the Paris Masters for the first time by overpowering second-seeded Rafael Nadal 6-2, 6-3 on Saturday.         
	The third-seeded Djokovic, who has a 6-14 record against Nadal but beat him for the second consecutive time, was dominant from the start and didnt face a single break point on his way to victory.         
	He will take on Frenchman Gael Monfils, the 15th seed, in the final, who defeated Radek Stepanek 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 in the other semis.         
	Winning 83 percent of the points played on his first serve, Djokovic, who had 31 winners, took the first set after claiming four games in a row.         
	The Serb had defeated French Open runner-up Robin Soderling 6-4, 1-6, 6-3 in the quarters.         
	On Friday, Nadal eliminated defending champion Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7-5, 7-5 with his best tennis of the week, in the last-eight stage.         
	The Spaniard returned to competition in October after a month off with a pulled stomach muscle.

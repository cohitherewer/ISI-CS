                                                   Aussie colts fight back
                      
	Hobart: Indian colts squandered a position of strength as the Australian under-19 team declared its first innings at 306 for seven riding on Tom Beatons century on the opening day of the first three-day match here on Saturday.         
	The Indians, who have won the limited overs series 2-0, reduced the Australians to 69 for three by the 24th over but the home team wriggled out of the tight spot with a 101-run fourth wicket partnership between Tim Armstrong (50) and Beaton (106).         
	In reply, India were 18 for no loss with openers Mayank Aggarwal and Manan Sharma undefeated on six and 12 respectively, at the draw of stumps on the opening day.         
	Beaton and Sean Abbot (51 not out) put up a 60-run stand for the seventh wicket, which saw the Australians cross the 300 mark at Bellerive Oval here.         
	For India, Jaidev Unadkad and Manan Sharma took two wickets apiece conceding 51 and 47 runs respectively, while Gagandeep Singh, Saurav Netravalkar and Ashok Meneria chipped in with a wicket each.         
	Jaidev bowled a tight line with the new ball as he troubled Australian opener Joel Garrett. Garrett could score only one run from the 12 balls he faced before being dismissed in the seventh over of the day.         
	The Australians found themselves in further trouble as Jaidev dismissed Mitchell Marsh (29) to reduce the home team to 53 for two. The other opener Nick Maddison (28) fell to Netravalkar leaving Australia at 69 for three before Beaton and Armstrong rescued them.         
	Beaton faced 159 balls and hit nine fours and two sixes in his 106.         
	It was good to get a few and it felt awesome to be out there and especially the way it came up (with a six), I wasnt expecting that with everyone in the ring, Beaton was quoted in a cricket website. Wickets fell a bit early so I just had to adjust and play a more mature role and work the ones and get the scoreboard ticking over, he said.

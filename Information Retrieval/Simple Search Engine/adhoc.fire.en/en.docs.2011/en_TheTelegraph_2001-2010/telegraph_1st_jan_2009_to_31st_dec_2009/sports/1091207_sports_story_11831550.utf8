            K. KUMARASWAMY                                  Members of the history-creating Team India XI along with others of the squad and some of the support staff, at the Brabourne Stadium, on Sunday. (PTI)     
	Mumbai: The Brabourne seems to have continued from where it left off. The last Test at the CCI, although it ended in a draw, saw Ajit Wadekar lead India to completing a hattrick of series wins in 1972-73.         
	Thirty-six years later, on Sunday, the stadium was the site of another landmark moment for Indian cricket as Mahendra Singh Dhoni and company rose to No.1 in Test rankings with victory by an innings and 24 runs in the third and final Test for a 2-0 triumph in the Jaypee Cup.         
	The Indians wrapped up the Sri Lanka second innings with just over half-an-hour gone in the final morning.         
	With four wickets in hand and the captain still at the crease, the visitors resistance was supposed to last a little longer. But once Zaheer Khan found the outside edge of Kumar Sangakkaras bat on the third ball of the day, the rest became a formality.         
	The left-arm speedster struck twice more to get rid off Nuwan Kulasekera (19) and Rangana Herath (3) to finish with five for 72.         
	Harbhajan Singh then had Lanka counterpart Muttiah Muralidharan caught behind in the days eighth over to trigger off the celebrations.         
	We havent been thinking about becoming the No.1. All we wanted to do was play well against every team, Dhoni said after the win.         
	It was a constant process over the last 18 months and a great team effort. Its the result of good preparation and execution.         
	There have been some tough games, but the individuals have stood up. Also, there havent been many injuries during this period. So, weve been able to have a core group. In the past, weve not always had the best squad.         
	Dhoni clarified that the No.1 status was not a goal set when Gary Kirsten took over as coach, in 2008.         
	He did not come in to make us the No.1 team, but to help us become better players. He is a fantastic guy one of the best coaches I have seen, he said.         
	Its going to be quite a task for the Indians to remain No.1, especially because they play few Tests in the coming months.         
	Well, I cant do anything about it, Dhoni said. It depends on the schedule. Next, we play Bangladesh After that, I dont know when we play our next Test or whom we play.         
	I think to sustain this position we have to do well everywhere, wherever we go and whichever team we play.         
	It is a bit of a concern that we are playing just two Tests against Bangladesh Over the next six months or so it will be tough for us to maintain this position.         
	But at the same time we have done something remarkable, so we would rather celebrate than think what next or what we should be doing. At the moment, we would like to just be with the achievement.         
	Team India have now won seven matches and remained unbeaten in the 10 Tests they have played under Dhoni.         
	Personally, I dont think it is about the golden touch, it is what the players do on the field, otherwise, more often than not, you would see non-playing captains. Basically, you are picking someone who is good at that and has plenty of luck, the skipper said.         
	Dhoni was happy to have contributed to the victory with an unbeaten 100. It is memorable but it is not about comparisons. It is my third Test hundred, so not many too choose from, he said.         
	The first one at Faisalabad was special and even the one at Ahmedabad was good. I think all of them are memorable and, since I dont have plenty of them, I will remember each.         
	Of course, the sixes were great and they were some of the biggest sixes I have hit in Tests and it feels good.

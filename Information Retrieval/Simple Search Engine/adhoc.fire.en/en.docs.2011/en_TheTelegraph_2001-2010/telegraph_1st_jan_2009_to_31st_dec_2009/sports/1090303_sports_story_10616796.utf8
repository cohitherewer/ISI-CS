	Madrid: Sergio Agueros late goal helped Atletico Madrid come from behind to beat Barcelona 4-3 and blow the Spanish title race wide open.         
	Barcelona, who led 2-0 and 3-2 on Sunday, have now failed to win in four matches and have seen their lead over Real Madrid cut from 12 points, just three weeks ago, to four.         
	Thierry Henry put Barcelona ahead with a fine strike from 25 yards which flew into the top corner after 18 minutes before Lionel Messi, on the half-hour mark, produced a trademark dribble before finishing in style.         
	Diego Forlan brought Atletico back into the match with a spectacular 30-yard drive before Aguero got the first of his brace after 56 minutes.         
	Barcelona, who were stunned by struggling Espanyol last weekend, re-established their lead when Eidur Gudjohnsen unselfishly played in Henry for his second from close range in the 73rd minute.         
	But Atletico were not finished and Forlan again scored, this time from the penalty spot in the 80th minute, before Aguero struck in the 89th minute to win the match.         
	Meanwhile, the pressure is growing on Valencia coach Unai Emery as his side followed their mid-week Uefa Cup elimination with a 2-1 home defeat by Valladolid.         
	After a bright start to the season, Valencia have tumbled to sixth in the table and have now gone more than a month without a win.         
	It took just six minutes for Valladolid to go ahead with Jonathan Sesma heading home but then chances came and went for both sides before Raul Albiol scored an own goal to double the lead.         
	Valencia continued to create openings but missing David Villa through suspension they lacked a finishing touch.         
	They did eventually manage to find the back of the net through Carlos Marchena after 73.         
	In Rome, Inter Milan twice came back from two-goal deficits against AS Roma to snatch a thrilling 3-3 draw at the San Siro and extend their lead at the top of Serie A to seven points.         
	But a brace from teenager Mario Balotelli and a late equaliser from Hernan Crespo stole a share of the spoils and helped to maintain a sizeable gap to second-placed Juventus, who beat Napoli 1-0 on Saturday.         
	Roma were the better team in the first period and on 23 minutes young full-back Marco Motta cut in from the right and crossed left-footed into the box where Daniele De Rossi arrived late to out-jump Javier Zanetti and glance home a fine header.         
	Jon Arne Riise notched a second on 29 minutes after galloping down the left onto a David Pizarro through ball, sneaking in behind Maicon and squeaking the ball through Julio Cesars legs and in from a seemingly impossible angle.         
	Nicolas Burdisso had to make a last ditched challenge to deny Mirko Vucinic as Roma threatened to run riot in the first half.         
	But straight after the break Inter were given a lifeline as Adriano teed up Balotelli to beat Doni at his near post.         
	But Inters reprieve didnt last long as Matteo Brighi ran through a gap in the home defence on 57 minutes before rifling home from outside the area.         
	Inter quickly pulled a goal back as Balotelli scored from the spot after the referee had given a penalty for a foul on the teenage forward.         
	Inter kept plugging away and two veteran substitutes fashioned an equaliser as Luis Figo crossed for Crespo to nod home 11 minutes from time. AC Milan crashed to a 2-1 defeat at Antonio Cassano-inspired Sampdoria as the heat on coach Carlo Ancelotti cranked up another notch.

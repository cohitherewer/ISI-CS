  - French Open 
  -   Stosur reaches her first major semi-final with another solid performance         NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE AMP; AGENCIES            Svetlana Kuznetsova in action at Roland Garros on Wednesday. (AFP)                                 
	Paris: Svetlana Kuznetsova squandered a big lead Wednesday but still ended Serena Williams 18-match Grand Slam winning streak by winning 7-6 (7-3), 5-7, 7-5 in the French Open quarter finals.         
	Second seed Serena was seeking her third successive major title and the 11th of her career. She was on the verge of reaching the womens final four after mounting a comeback and taking a 3-1 lead in the final set. She blamed nerves for her defeat.         
	In the third set, I had an opportunity and I got really tight, and I pretty much gave it to her, Serena said. It was like, Here, do you want to go to the semis? Because I dont. She was like, OK.         
	Seventh seed Kuznetsova faced a set point serving at 5-6 in the first set but erased it with a slam and won that set. Serena rallied three points from defeat to even the match, then took a 3-1 lead in the third. The seesaw struggle was so close that midway through the third set, each player had won 100 points.         
	Kuznetsova mounted the final comeback and broke serve in the last game when a weary Serena committed three unforced errors, including a backhand pushed wide on match point.         
	Honestly, I think I lost because of me, and not because of anything she did, Serena remarked.         
	Kuznetsova, the 2004 US Open champion, is seeking her second major title. Her opponent Thursday will be Samantha Stosur of Australia, who reached her first major semi-final by beating Sorana Cirstea of Romania 6-1, 6-3. Stosur, 25, has never won a tour title.         
	Stosur, an athletic Australian with a high-kicking serve, dropped only three games in the fourth round against Virginie Razzano and dropped just four more in the quarter finals on Wednesday against the unseeded Cirstea.         
	But it has been anything but easy for the 30th-seeded Stosur to reach this phase. A year ago, she came to the French Open with low expectations, simply working her way back into shape after missing several months of competition because of Lyme disease.         
	Now, she finds herself in the semi-finals of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time in singles. What a difference a year can make, Stosur, 25, said. Last year I was still really careful about what I was doing and wasnt sure how much to do and what not to do. And this year its just fantastic.         
	Kuznetsova bounced back from being sent to the court in a messy spill that left her covered with clay. Kuznetsova was serving one point from a 5-2 lead in the second set when she turned her right ankle in pursuit of a shot and fell on her back.         
	She rose with clay covering the back of her shirt and the length of her right arm. Dirt was in her hair and even on her forehead. She was unhurt and play quickly resumed, but it took awhile for Kuznetsova to regain her footing.         
	The Russian won with high-risk tennis, whacking winners into both corners and sometimes choosing angles that surprised Serena.         
	Kuznetsova showed lots of variety, too, when she hit a crosscourt lob, Serena staggered helplessly as she watched the ball land beyond her reach. She was sometimes betrayed by uncertain footwork on clay, which led to repeated errors on her forehand side down the stretch.         
	In the womens semi-finals Thursday, top-ranked Dinara Safina will face No. 20-seeded Dominika Cibulkova.

	Budapest: Ferraris Felipe Massa will be kept under sedation for 48 hours after fracturing his skull in a freak accident at the Hungarian Grand Prix, a hospital doctor attending the Formula One driver said on Sunday.         
	Peter Bazso, medical director at the AEK military hospital, said the 28-year-old Brazilian was in a stable condition after surgery on Saturday. A brain scan on Sunday had produced reassuring results.         
	It brought the result that we had expected concerning an injury of this type, he said.         
	The doctor said Massa nonetheless remained in intensive care and in an acute phase of treatment.         
	He was woken from sedation briefly on Sunday after family members arrived, but then put back. The doctor said Massa will remain in that state for 48 hours before being awakened again.         
	Bazso said doctors were able to remove the broken bones and stabilise the area, which was necessary since Massa arrived with an open skull fracture and a contusion.         
	However, Bazso declined to go into details about the length or type of further treatment.         
	Last years championship runner-up was flown to hospital after being hit on the head by bouncing debris from compatriot Rubens Barrichellos Brawn during Saturdays qualifying.         
	A defence ministry official said on Saturday that the driver had been in a serious, life-threatening condition before the emergency operation.         
	The accident, which is likely to rule Massa out of the next few races as well as Sundays at the Hungaroring, brought back grim memories of the crash that killed compatriot and triple champion Ayrton Senna at Imola in 1994 and led to renewed concerns about safety.         
	Ferrari said in their own update on Sunday morning that Massas condition remains stable and there were no further complications through the night.         
	Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone went to see the Brazilian on Saturday night and said he hoped to visit again later.         
	I think hes okay. Everybody seemed quite happy with him this morning. The hospitals happy, which is more important, he said.         
	The sports governing body, FIA, launched an investigation into the crash after several drivers and team principals called for safety measures to be re-examined.           (AGENCIES)

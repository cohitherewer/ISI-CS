                                                   Naseem ruled out
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting will be missing the services of goalkeeper Naseem Akhtar in their crucial I-League match against Churchill Brothers in Goa on Thursday. Akhtar was suffering from chicken pox.         
	The black and white brigade had a practice session at the club ground on Monday. Coach Shabbir Ali admitted that Churchill are a strong side but reminded that an upset was not impossible. They have very good players, but if we perform to our best, a victory cannot be ruled out, he said.         
	The club have written to the AIFF to appoint a neutral observer for the JCT-Mumbai FC final round match in Ludhiana on Thursday.

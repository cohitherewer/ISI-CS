            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Mahindra United striker Sushil Kumar Singh has been named the Indian captain for the eight-nation SAFF Cup to be played in Dhaka from December 4 to 13.         
	India are placed in Group A along with Afghanistan, Nepal and the Maldives. India will kick off their campaign against Afghanistan on December 5.         
	No one should underestimate us just because we have an under-23 squad, said the Indian coach Sukhwinder Singh before leaving for Mumbai from Dhaka on Tuesday.         
	I am sure they will prove their worth in the SAFF Cup, added Sukhwinder.

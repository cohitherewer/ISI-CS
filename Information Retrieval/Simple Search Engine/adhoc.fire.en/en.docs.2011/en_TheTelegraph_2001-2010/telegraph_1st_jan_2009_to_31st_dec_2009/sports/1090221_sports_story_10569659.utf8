The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Eden gets all seven, KKR shun Cuttack
                                                   Eden gets all seven, KKR shun Cuttack
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Eden Gardens will host all seven home matches of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in the second edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL). The tournament gets underway on April 10.         
	At a hastily convened news conference, Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Jagmohan Dalmiya said that Knight Riders co-owner Jay Mehta informed him of the decision on Friday.         
	I received a call from Jay Mehta and he confirmed that all the seven matches this year would be played in Calcutta, Dalmiya said.         
	The announcement puts to rest all speculation that a couple of the Knight Riders home matches could be hosted by Cuttacks Barabati Stadium. It was learnt that logistic problems in Cuttack finally tilted the scales in the citys favour.         
	Speaking to reporters, Dalmiya admitted that despite Fridays confirmation, time was still short for getting Eden ready for a month of busy action. He added in the same breath that the CAB would do everything in its power to ensure there was no cause for complaint.         
	We will burn the midnight lamp and make the Eden presentable before the IPL. On behalf of the CAB, I have assured Knight Riders of our best co-operation.         
	Meanwhile, wicketkeeper-batsman Morne Van Wyk of South Africa will be Ricky Pontings replacement.         
	The 29-year-old has played six ODIs and two Twenty20 Internationals. As part of their preparations, Knight Riders will play a few practice matches in Dhaka next month.         
	Lalit Modi, the IPL commissioner, said that Deccan Chargers have selected Visakhapatnam as the venue for two of their home matches in the second edition of the IPL.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Victoria Bushrangers did exactly what they were needed to. Required to cross the 83-run mark to make the Super Eight on better net run rate, the Australians achieved the mark by the 18th over to force the Wayamba Elevens out of the Airtel Champions League Twenty20 on Tuesday.         
	The Sri Lankans were definitely the most frustrated lot at the Kotla. They won the match by 15 runs, yet bowed out on net run rate. The Bushrangers and the Delhi DareDevils are the ones from Group D to cross the first round hurdles.

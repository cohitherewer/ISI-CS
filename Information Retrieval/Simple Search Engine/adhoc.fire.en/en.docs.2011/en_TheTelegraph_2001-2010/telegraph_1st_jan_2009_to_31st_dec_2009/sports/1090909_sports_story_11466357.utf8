The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Massa is rooting for Barrichello
                                                   Massa is rooting for Barrichello
                      
	London: Jenson Button needs to cope better with the pressure of leading the standings if the Briton wants to secure a first Formula One title, last years runner-up Felipe Massa has told a British daily.         
	The Ferrari driver, recovering from life-threatening head injuries suffered in Hungary in July, said in an interview published on Tuesday that he was backing Buttons Brawn teammate and Brazilian compatriot Rubens Barrichello.         
	Barrichello, a friend of Massa, is 16 points adrift of Button with five races remaining, but the championship leader has taken only 11 points in his last five races after winning six of the first seven.         
	Massa pointed out that he had been six points behind McLarens Lewis Hamilton going into the final race last year and still almost won the title.         
	That was one race, Rubens has five races to close 16 points. Its a big possibility but it depends on Jenson. If Jenson carries on in this bad way it will help Rubens a lot, he said.         
	In my opinion, Jenson has gone down because of the pressure. Its the only reason.         
	In the earlier races, he was almost half a second (a lap) quicker than some teams. You win the race easy and there is not so much pressure. But now we have races where things are more difficult, Massa said.         
	So for me the pressure has had a big impact on his mind  and he needs to deal with it better. If he does not cope with the pressure he will not win the championship.         
	Massa, interviewed in his Sao Paulo apartment before undergoing cosmetic surgery on Monday, is not due to return until next season. He said he felt his accident happened for a reason and would make him stronger.         
	Massa said he was fortunate not to have been blinded or killed by the bouncing spring shed by Barrichellos car in qualifying at the Hungaroring and added that he would discuss possible ways of improving safety when he returned.

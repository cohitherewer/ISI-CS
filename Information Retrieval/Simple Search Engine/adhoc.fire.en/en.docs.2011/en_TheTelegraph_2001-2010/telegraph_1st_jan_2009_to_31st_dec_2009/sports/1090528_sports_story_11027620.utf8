                                                   Copter to Bhajjis rescue
                      
	Jalandhar: India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, who came for a short visit to his residence here, was stuck in the curfew that was enforced after violence erupted following the murder of a religious Sikh guru in Vienna, and had to fly to Chandigarh by a helicopter for going to Mumbai.         
	I came to visit my family on May 23. As I have to attend an urgent meeting with Nita Ambani, owner of the Mumbai Indians team, on Thursday in Mumbai, the Reliance company arranged a helicopter for me and I flew to Chandigarh to take the flight to Mumbai, said Harbhajan.         
	Harbhajan boarded the helicopter from PAP Ground at about 7.30am, where a special helipad was made by the district administration, sources said.         
	Even my brother-in-law was stuck in the violence on May 23 and had to spend the whole night in a nearby hospital along with his family, the off-spinner added.         
	Terming the Vienna incident as very unfortunate, Harbhajan appealed to the residents of Punjab to restore peace and harmony.

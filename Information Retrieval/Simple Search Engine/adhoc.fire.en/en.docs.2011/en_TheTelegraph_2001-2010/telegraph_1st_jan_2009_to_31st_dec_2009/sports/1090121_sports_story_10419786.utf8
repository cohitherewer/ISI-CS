The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB not to seek damages
                                                   PCB not to seek damages
                      
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Tuesday said it would not seek compensation from India for cancelling their tour scheduled from January this year.         
	A senior PCB official said since the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) only followed the policy decision of its government not to tour Pakistan in the wake of Mumbai terror attacks, there was nothing the PCB could do.         
	Once a board adheres to a policy decision of the government that matter cannot be taken to the disputes committee of the ICC, the official said.         
	PCB suffered a revenue loss of around the $40 million because of the Indias cancelled tour but the relations between the two the boards remain good. I dont think our relations are such that we would like to claim any compensation, he said.         
	The official said Pakistan was hopeful that once relations between the two countries improved cricket matches would resume. (PTI)

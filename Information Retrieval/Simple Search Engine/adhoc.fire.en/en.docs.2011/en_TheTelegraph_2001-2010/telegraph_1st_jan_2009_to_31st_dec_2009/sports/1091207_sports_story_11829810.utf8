The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India to end year as the No.1 Test team
                                                                                                                       7                                      India to end year as the No.1 Test team
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Test No.1 status for the first time and, whats more, this time it wont be as ephemeral as the ODI top spot that Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. have earned on more than one occasion in the recent past only to be toppled within days.         
	India had started the year in third place behind Australia and South Africa, but will end 2009 at No.1. Australia are, at the moment, engaged in a three-Test series versus the West Indies. But even a clean sweep by Ricky Pontings men wont be good enough to topple India. If theres a team that can spoil Indias party, it is South Africa.         
	The Proteas begin their Test series against England on December 16. A defeat in the five-match ODI series means Graeme Smiths men will be eager to put the disappointment of a home loss behind them by bouncing back.         
	South Africa had gone to the top of the Test rankings in August after Australia lost the Ashes to England. A 2-0 series win or better will give the Proteas back their No.1 spot, but anything less will result in an increase in Indias lead.         
	But that scenario will arise only in January.         
	While India have only two Tests  against Bangladesh  to maintain a hold on their No. 1 position, South Africa play at least four and Australia six. A 2-0 win against Bangladesh isnt likely to give India too many ratings points either, so they could be overtaken depending on how South Africa do against England, and how Australia go against the West Indies and Pakistan.         
	Sundays victory put India on top, the defeat has dropped Sri Lanka from second to fourth on the table.         
	India are only the third team after Australia and South Africa to surge to the top of the ladder.

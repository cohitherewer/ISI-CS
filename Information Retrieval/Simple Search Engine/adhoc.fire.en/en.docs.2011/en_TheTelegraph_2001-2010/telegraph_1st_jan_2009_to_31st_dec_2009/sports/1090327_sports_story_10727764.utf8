                                                   Im enjoying every outing, says Sachin
                      
	Napier: Sachin Tendulkar said he felt motivated enough to keep going for as long as he enjoys the game and that, at the moment, with the runs flowing from his bat, he was in no mood to talk about retirement.         
	With more than 29,000 international runs  including 85 centuries  under his belt, there is little left for Sachin to achieve, but the champion batsman insists he has yet to lose motivation.         
	Im not in a position to answer that, he said in response to how long he sees himself in international cricket.         
	Ive not made up my mind yet. Im extremely happy to be in this position and am enjoying every outing. It has been a fantastic journey, he said.         
	I have been through various challenges and ups and downs. Its all circles of life and I want to complete the circle.         
	As long as Im enjoying and keep giving my best, Ill continue to play. The day I start feeling otherwise, that will be the time to stop, he explained.         
	Tendulkar said he loves the game and has a lot to keep going for.         
	Im always a firm believer in chasing dreams. My dream was to play for India for as long as possible That is the ultimate thing for me.

	DAY I HIGHLIGHTS  
	It is the first time in Test history that a side has fielded four players who have been part of Test wins in every Test-playing nation. Having been a part of the first Test winning side in Hamilton mdash; Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, VVS Laxman and Virender Sehwag have now been part of Test wins in all 10 Test-playing countries.  
	The last occasion when India played one specialist spinner while the opponent played two was also against New Zealand in Hamilton in 1999. Anil Kumble for the visitors and Daniel Vettori and Paul Wiseman for the hosts were the spinners. The match was drawn.  
	McLean Park in Napier, which is hosting its eighth Test, is only the second international venue (with five or more Tests) where the home side has not recorded a single win. The National Stadium in Dhaka has hosted nine Tests with no wins for Bangladesh.  
	Virender Sehwag is leading India in a Test for the second time. He led India in Rahul Dravids absence against Sri Lanka in Ahmedabad in December 2005. India won that match by 259 runs.  
	MS Dhoni is missing his sixth Test match since he made his debut in December 2005. Interestingly, India have managed to win only one Test (vs SL in Galle, 2008) in Dhonis absence, while losing three and drawing one.

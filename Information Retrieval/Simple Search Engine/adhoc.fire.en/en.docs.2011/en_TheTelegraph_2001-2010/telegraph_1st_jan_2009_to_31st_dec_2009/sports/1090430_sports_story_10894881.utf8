The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Suspended ban for McLaren 
                                                   Suspended ban for McLaren 
                      
	Paris: McLaren have been given a suspended three-race ban for deliberately misleading stewards at the Australian Grand Prix in March, the International Automobile Federation (Fia) said Wednesday.         
	The Fia said the contrite way in which team principal Martin Whitmarsh had apologised for the incident was taken into account after McLaren, the team of world champion Lewis Hamilton, were charged with five counts of bringing the sport into disrepute.         
	Having regard to the open and honest way in which McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh addressed the World Motor Sport Council (WMSC) and the change in culture he made clear has taken place in his organisation, the WMSC decided to suspend the application of the penalty it deemed appropriate, the Fia said in a statement.         
	That penalty is a suspension of the team from three races (in the world championship). This will only be applied if further facts emerge regarding the case or if in the next 12 months there is further breach by the team.         
	The controversy started when Hamilton, who did not attend the hearing, and the team denied the driver had been instructed to let Toyotas Jarno Trulli past while following the safety car, despite an order being captured on radio recordings.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India have prayer on their lips
                                                   India have prayer on their lips
                      
	Sydney: India will have to defeat the West Indies in their do-or-die Super Six match here Thursday to keep alive their faint chances of making the final of the ICC Womens World Cup.         
	Thanks to their five-wicket loss to New Zealand Tuesday, Jhulan Goswami and her teammates are on the threshold of a disappointing exit from the event and their chances of progressing to the March 22 final hinges not just on their performance, but also on their fortunes.         
	Even though the Indians are still ahead of New Zealand on run rate, they would still have to beat the West Indies Thursday and pray New Zealand go down to Pakistan and, England beat Australia in the remaining Super Six matches.         
	Jhulan did not hide her disappointment after the setback against New Zealand.         
	We worked extremely hard for the World Cup but all has gone down the drain because of one bad performance. It is a devastating blow to all of us as the next World Cup will be after four years and who knows who will be there then, she said.         
	Indian batting has been inconsistent in the tournament so far with Mithali Raj shining initially and veteran left-hander Anjum Chopra regaining her touch later on. The bowling too has been far from menacing. (PTI)

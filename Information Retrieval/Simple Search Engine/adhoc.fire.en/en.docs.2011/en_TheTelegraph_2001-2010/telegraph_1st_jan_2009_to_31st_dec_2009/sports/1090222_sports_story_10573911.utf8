                                                     IPL isnt music to Arjunas ears
    - Twenty20 tournament features prominently in application before Lankas Supreme Court             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Arjuna Ranatunga                                 
	Calcutta: With the Shilpa Shettys preparing to groove for the moolah-oozing Indian Premier League (IPL), the Twenty20 tournaments edition No.2 is set to become the flavour of this cricket season.         
	It wont be music to Arjuna Ranatungas ears, though.         
	Sri Lankas only World Cup-winning captain has, in fact, listed his country-comes-first stand on the IPL issue as a reason why he was removed as chairman of the interim committee running Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC).         
	The IPL features rather prominently in Ranatungas meticulously drafted 35-page fundamental rights application before the countrys Supreme Court, wherein he has challenged his ouster, some two months ago.         
	Moved on January 22, the application (a copy of which is in The Telegraphs possession, courtesy well-placed sources in Colombo) will be heard on May 25.         
	Significantly, SLC chief executive Duleep Mendis is one of the five respondents. Hes No.3 on the list, which is topped by Ranatungas bete noire, senior (cabinet) sports minister Gamini Lokuge.         
	Ranatunga and Mendis were very close, at one time, but theyve had differences ever since the latter became the chief executive some years ago.         
	Chairmen have come and gone, but Mendis has been providing continuity in administration.         
	The other respondents are sports secretary S. Liyanagama (No.2), junior (non-cabinet) sports minister Bandura Basnayaka (No.4) and, finally, the countrys attorney general.         
	For now, Liyanagama is SLCs Competent Authority, effectively its chairman.         
	The application confirms that the Mahela Jayawardenes had been given permission to play in only the IPLs inaugural edition, in 2008.         
	That, too, conditionally  subject to them being available for any commitments with SLC at any given time.         
	In other words, the players were obliged to toe SLCs line this year.         
	However, with Lokuge stepping in, SLC had to scrap a tour of England (which would have generated $2 million) this summer and, with Ranatunga out of the way, a 10-year deal was struck with the powerful Board of Control for Cricket in India, which is promoting the IPL.         
	The arrangement with England had been at Ranatungas initiative and the turnaround embarrassed him no end.         
	Interestingly, Ranatunga has accused Mendis and Sidath Wettimuny (also an ex-teammate) of distorting facts after an IPL meeting in Bangkok late last year.         
	Mendis, Wettimuny and a member of the players body had been sent as SLC representatives by Lokuge and not by Ranatunga.         
	Strange, but perhaps not all that surprising given Lokuges desire to call the shots.         
	At one point, Ranatungas application states: The petitioner now has reason to believe, therefore, that the discussions which took place at the aforesaid Bangkok meeting had been most unfairly distorted, in a contrived bid to bring the petitioner into disrepute, as the petitioner obviously stood in the way of those with vested interests, who wanted at all cost to ensure that the IPL deal went through for their own individual commercial interests.         
	Annexures include copies of reports in the Sri Lanka media slamming the IPL-favouring arrangement reached last month.         
	Suffice to say a deal wouldnt have been possible (at least not on the terms agreed upon by SLC) had Ranatunga been in the chair.         
	An assertion made by Ranatunga, a member of Parliament, in the introduction of his application is worth noting.         
	 The petitioner further states that in his relentless pursuit of striving to develop cricket in the country, he has been outspoken and forthright on issues of importance to cricket. This has made certain powerful individuals most uncomfortable His removal has been instigated by such individuals with myopic, vested interests         
	Couldnt get hotter than that.

	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan went through to the semi-finals, advancing on the basis of goal difference, of the 114th IFA Shield after they drew with Mahindra United 1-1 at home Sunday.         
	The green and maroon brigade will take on Chirag United Wednesday for a spot in the final.         
	All did not go well for the Mumbai outfit as the match was disrupted for eight minutes in the second-half after their goalkeeper, Subhasish Roy Chowdhury, was hit on the forehead by a stone hurled from the stands.         
	Bagan took the lead in the 23rd minute, courtesy Snehasish Chakraborty. Marcos Pereira passed to James Singh, who crossed it to Snehasish from the centre and the midfielder headed the ball to the left, out of the reach the national goalkeeper who made a lunge for it.         
	The visitors, however, hit back in the first minute of the second half through Serbian recruit Suetozar Mijin who headed in the equaliser off a K. Aseem centre.         
	Other than the two goals, miss passes, missed opportunities and yellow cards made up the rest of the game.         
	Bagan captain Deepak Mondal was the only one who looked solid in the defence while goalkeeper Shilton Paul was brilliant on a couple of occasions. In the absence of N.S. Manju, the Bagan defence looked like crumbling in the second half but the defending champions were unable to capitalise on Bagans frailties. What is more, India international Steven Dias missed a penalty in the 86th minute.         
	We played a much better game than Bagan and deserved to win, said David Booth, the Mahindra coach. The behaviour of the crowd was unacceptable. They are not supporters but hooligans, he added.         
	Meanwhile, Karim Bencharifa felt his team had achieved their objective, which was to qualify for the semis. We were under pressure in the second half but came through, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dravids limited use over
                                                     Dravids limited use over
    - Selectors gamble on Yuvraj Singhs fitness; Rookie Sudeep Tyagi gets call-up           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Rahul Dravid                                 
	Calcutta: In the end, believe it or not, Rahul Dravid wasnt really discussed during Thursday mornings selection committee meeting, in Chennai, to pick XV for the first two ODIs against Australia.         
	In the lead up, though, the selectors (Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Yashpal Sharma, Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave, Raja Venkat) had been losing much sleep over the former India captain.         
	The committee had, after all, recalled Dravid only recently and the 36-year-old tried to put his best foot forward during the tri-series in Sri Lanka and in the Champions Trophy.         
	Dravid, obviously, had been under considerable pressure throughout.         
	Its a fact that Virender Sehwags unavailability for both tournaments played a significant role in the revival of Dravids ODI career, but nobody was actually looking at him being around till the 2011 World Cup.         
	Today, the focus is on that quadrennial showpiece and, so, its curtains for Dravid where ODIs are concerned. He has reasons to be pretty cut up, but the writing is very much on the wall.         
	Dravid couldve come into contention had Yuvraj Singh been ruled out of the two ODIs... Hell definitely be fit for the second one (October 28, in Nagpur), which is why Dravid wasnt really discussed at all, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	The seven-match series against the world champions gets under way in Vadodara on October 25.         
	Actually, theres even an outside chance of Yuvraj being fit for the first ODI... That call would be made before the toss... With that being the situation, and Sehwag confirmed as 100 per cent fit, there was no way of accommodating Dravid, the well-placed source added.         
	With a horses for courses approach being adopted and absolutely no place for sentiments (remember Sourav Ganguly being dropped in January 2008?), Dravid had to miss out.         
	As for Yuvraj, hes indispensable, which is why the gamble.         
	Also out from the Champions Trophy XV are Dinesh Karthik (a second wicket-keeper at home is more than a luxury), the inconsistent Rudra Pratap Singh, an out of form Yusuf Pathan and the somewhat unlucky Abhishek Nayar.         
	Ravindra Jadeja is back in the all-rounders berth, at Nayars expense, as hes seen more as a bowler who can bat, instead of the Mumbaikar, who is viewed more as a batsman.         
	Jadeja is a better fielder, too.         
	The in-and-out Munaf Patel has returned as well, rewarded for fine performances in recent weeks.         
	Rookie Sudeep Tyagi, the 22-year-old UP medium-pacer, tipped as the dark horse in these columns, has also been rewarded.         
	Ishant Sharma has kept his place, but he has to deliver. Indeed, he has to do so quickly.         
	For a change, U-19 World Cup-winning captain Virat Kohli has made it in his own right. He wont have to pray for somebody to get injured!         
	Kohli wont be seen as a Replacement Man, not for a while, at least.         
	The selectors havent named a vice-captain, for one usually isnt appointed for a home series, but the feeling is that Sehwag should (for now) be Mahendra Singh Dhonis unofficial deputy.         
	Not too long ago, Sehwag suggested that somebody else be groomed, but that was never communicated either to the Board or to the selectors.         
	Sehwag got back the vice-captaincy last November and held that position till a shoulder injury took him off cricket from June.         
	Yuvraj succeeded Sehwag and, when he himself got injured before the Champions Trophy, Gautam Gambhir wore the hat meant for the No.2.         
	Meanwhile, one learns that the 15-man squad will assemble in Mumbai on October 20 for a three-day camp.

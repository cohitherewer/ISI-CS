The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians spot on
                                                   Indians spot on
            JAYDEEP BASU                       
	New Delhi: Subrata Paul leapt in the air and the Ambedkar Stadium erupted in joyous celebration of his amazing save. He had fisted over Hamzeh Alattounis shot in the sudden-death tiebreaker to secure Indias historic 6-5 victory over Syria in the ONGC Nehru Cup final here Monday.         
	It was a fabulous day for the soccer fans in the capital, who filled the stands long before the start and wildly cheered every Indian move. They looked all set to return home disappointed after the home side twice surrendered the advantage to allow the visitors to make a comeback.         
	But in the end, India won the the sudden death tiebreaker 5-4 after 120 minutes of fierce battle ended with the teams tied at 1-1.         
	The triumph was Indias second in a row and, including the AFC Challenge Cup, their third in two years. In the last 24 months, Bob Houghtons boys have lost only one final, in the SAFF Cup at Colombo.         
	Paul was spectacular in the tiebreaker, as he has been throughout the tournament.         
	He first blocked Wael Ayans stiff shot to give India the lead and then denied Ahmad Haj Mohammed and Hamzeh Alattouni.         
	In the tiebreaker, which ended in a 3-3 draw, Climax Lawrence, Sunil Chetri and Steven Dias struck for India, while Rennedy Singh and Mehrajuddin Wadoo missed. In the sudden death, Anwar and Surkumar Singh were on target.         
	For Syria, Raja Rafe, Mosab Balhous, Abdul Fatah Alaga and Abdal Razak Al Housian converted while Wael Ayan, Ahmad Haj Mohammed and Hamzeh Alattouni missed their chances.         
	India could have wrapped up the tie in extra time itself  after either side failed to score in regulation time  had they held on for the last 20 seconds after substitute Rennedy Singh put them in the lead with a fine free-kick in the 114h minute. But Ali Dyab cancelled the lead with a header.         
	In the tiebreaker too, India led 3-2 only for Mehrajuddin to shoot straight at the goalkeeper on the final spot kick.         
	Earlier, although the atmosphere inside the stadium was electrifying the performance of the home team was far from it. Unlike the 2007 final where India were the dominant force, the hosts lost the initiative after playing a fine passing game in the first 15 minutes.         
	As the huge crowd relentlessly chanted India, India, the Syrians slowly took charge in the midfield to harass the Indian defence time and again.         
	That Syria could not create too many chances was mainly due to the two stoppers  Anwar and Gourmangi Singh  who were always there to bail the team out.         
	Bhaichung had talked about getting an early goal in the final on Sunday. Ironically, it was he who missed the best chance of the game in the first minute. Put through by Anthony Pereira, the Indian captain went past defender Ali Dyab only to see his hurried shot find the goalkeeper.         
	There was more drama on the technical benches than on the pitch. Worried by the vociferous crowd support the home team was getting, Syrian coach Fajer Ebrahim tried to put pressure on the referee in his own way. He questioned almost every decision of the Maldives referee and the play had to be stopped on a couple of occasions because of him.         
	There was a point in the second half when Houghton found the behaviour of his counterpart unbearable. He was seen pointing at the Syrian coach. Ebrahim got the message and tried to pacify Houghton but the British coach was least impressed.

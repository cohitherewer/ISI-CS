The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warne stuns with on-air jibe
                                                   Warne stuns with on-air jibe
            CRICKET BRIEFS                
	 Birmingham: Shane Warne shocked yet again by using a four-letter word while doing commentary for a sports channel during the drawn Ashes Test at Edgbaston.         
	According to the Daily Mirror, the former Australia spinner uttered the word t**t, a derogatory jibe, during the first over of Australian Ben Hilfenhaus with Andrew Strauss at the batting crease. Warne joked about why Strauss would not be entitled to a free hit against a bowler who was sending the ball from 10 yards behind the popping crease.         
	The ball had to pass the popping crease, the great spin doctor informed us, otherwise Strauss would have been allowed to stroll down the pitch and t**t it, the newspaper quoted Warne as saying.         
	Logo bungling         
	 Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board faced an embarrassing situation when a sponsor of the national team lodged a strong protest that the players had played the first two one-day Internationals in Sri Lanka without displaying their logo on their playing kit.         
	After the strong protest lodged by the sponsors, the board rushed new shirts with the sponsors logos on them to be in time for the third ODI at Dambulla Monday. The shirts were handed to the Pakistan A team that left on Sunday for a tour to Sri Lanka to be given to the senior team management.         
	Gibbs choice         
	 Johannesburg: South African opener Herschelle Gibbs will play for the Deccan Chargers in the Indian Champions League Twenty20 series rather than his home team Cape Cobras, which is also participating in the tournament. Gibbs agent Donne Commins told a South African daily that the player would be available for the IPL side and Cape Cobras will be compensated.         
	Appointments         
	 Calcutta: Javagal Srinath was Tuesday appointed match referee for the five-match ODI series between Zimbabwe and Bangladesh starting Sunday in Bulawayo. According to an ICC release, Amiesh Saheba will stand in each of those matches along with a local appointment. Meanwhile, David Jukes has been named match referee for the Intercontinental Cup                 STAFF REPORTER amp; AGENCIES

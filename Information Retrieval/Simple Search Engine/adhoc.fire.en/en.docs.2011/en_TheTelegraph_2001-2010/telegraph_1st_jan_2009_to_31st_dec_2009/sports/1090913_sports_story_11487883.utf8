The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | City shoot Gunners down
                                                     City shoot Gunners down
                  Manchester Uniteds Rio Ferdinand and Spurs Jermain Defoe vie for the ball during their EPL match on Saturday                     
	London: Manchester City passed the first big test of their big four credentials with flying colours on Saturday as, with ex-Gunner Emmanuel Adebayor again on the scoresheet, they beat Arsenal 4-2 to make it four wins out of four.               
	Champions Manchester United recovered from conceding an early goal to Tottenham Hotspur to win 3-1 even though Paul Scholes was sent off after an hour. Spurs went ahead when Jermain Defoe scored in the first minute. Ryan Giggs equalised. Anderson and Wayne Rooney got Uniteds remaining goals               
	Chelsea also maintained their record with their fifth win but needed a last-minute Florent Malouda goal for a 2-1 victory at Stoke City.         
	Yossi Benayoun scored a hattrick as Liverpool ended their sticky run by thrashing Burnley 4-0 at Anfield.         
	Big-spending City have beaten Blackburn Rovers, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Portsmouth but knew things would not be so easy when Arsenal came calling.         
	They went ahead with a soft own goal after 20 minutes when a looping Micah Richards header rebounded off a post against the head of goalkeeper Manuel Almunia and into the net.         
	Arsenal barely threatened in a poor-quality first half but improved markedly after the break.         
	They got their equaliser after 62 minutes when Robin van Persie shot on the turn from the edge of the box  the first goal City have conceded this season.         
	City recovered brilliantly though to take command with three goals in 10 minutes.         
	They regained the lead after 74 minutes when Richards surged into the box and squared for Craig Bellamy to finish well.         
	Adebayor, Citys 25 million summer signing from Arsenal, headed the third and Shaun Wright-Phillips then finished off a great breakaway.         
	Adebayors decision to run the length of the pitch to celebrate his goal in front of the Arsenal fans did not go down well and earned him a booking but the Togo international, who has now scored in all four of Citys league games, was quick to apologise.         
	I shouldnt have done what I did but the emotion took over me and Im sorry for what Ive done, he said.         
	Czech midfielder Tomas Rosicky, making his first club appearance after 20 months out with a knee injury, got Arsenals late second.         
	Last season Chelsea scored twice in the last three minutes to claim a 2-1 comeback win over Stoke at Stamford Bridge and the Londoners left the Stoke fans fuming again with a repeat performance.         
	The Londoners, who had 20 players away on international duty in midweek, understandably looked sluggish in the early stages but after Abdoulaye Faye had put Stoke ahead when he was left unmarked to head in, Didier Drogba equalised with a well-taken shot in the lengthy first-half injury time.         
	It was all Chelsea in the second half but they had to wait until the last minute for Malouda to snatch the winner.         
	Burnleys hopes of adding the scalp of Liverpool to those of Manchester United and Everton were swept aside at Anfield as Liverpool found their form after a stuttering start to the season.         
	Benayoun got things moving and Dirk Kuyt made it 2-0 at halftime after Benayouns shot was parried by goalkeeper Brian Jensen.         
	The Israeli got the third after an hour and completed his hattrick eight minutes from time.         
	Portsmouth and Bolton Wanderers, without a point between them at the start of play, produced a thriller at Fratton Park with Bolton snatching the points in the last few minutes when Gary Cahill gave them a 3-2 victory.         
	In other games Blackburn Rovers beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-1, Sunderland thumped Hull City 4-1 while Wigan Athletic edged West Ham United 1-0.           (REUTERS)

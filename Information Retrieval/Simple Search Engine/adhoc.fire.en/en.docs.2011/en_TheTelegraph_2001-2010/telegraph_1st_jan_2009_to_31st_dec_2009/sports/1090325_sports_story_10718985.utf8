                                                   Bagan tie likely to be shifted
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  
	New Delhi: Mohun Bagans concluding I-League match against Mahindra United, scheduled in Mumbai on April 16, may now be played at either Delhi or Gurgaon.         
	According to sources, the Western India Football Association (WIFA) has expressed its inability to host the two last round I-League matches at the Cooperage because of elections.         
	They havent received police permission to hold the matches on April 15 and 16, said a source in the AIFF. There is a proposal to shift the matches to Gurgaon or Delhi.         
	As per the original schedule, Air India were to take on Sporting Clube de Goa on April 15, followed by the Mahindra-Mohun Bagan match the next day.         
	The AIFF would prefer to have the matches on the scheduled dates on different grounds. We cannot postpone the matches as Mohun Bagan will have to travel outside the country to play an AFC Cup match on April 21, sources said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rudi hits out at cheaters
                                                   Rudi hits out at cheaters
                      
	London: A criticism-stung Rudi Koertzen Wednesday hit back at the cricketers who refuse to walk after nicking the ball and said it is because of these cheating batsmen that umpiring has become such a difficult job.         
	Koertzen and the West Indian Billy Doctrove incurred the media wrath because of their inconsistency in referring controversial decisions to the third umpire during the Lords Test which England won.         
	It is a shame that you have to do it that way. The players will stand there, nick the ball and wait for the umpire to make a decision. For me, thats cheating, Koertzon told a cricket website.         
	The umpiring duo had referred Australian Nathan Hauritzs claimed catch of Ravi Bopara to the third umpire but later refused to send Andrew Strausss controversial catch of Phillip Hughes upstairs.         
	Why dont you get off the field and make it easy for the game? There would be more pleasure in the game. I know that Ponting would say, Boys, lets try (accepting the umpires word), he said.         
	Ive been in those meetings when he said, Lets try it, and then you get to the second day in a Test match and a guy claims a catch and ten minutes later you hear, The ball didnt carry, and then the argument starts again. Lets use the technology when its there, he revealed.         
	Koertzen defended his decision of not referring the catch to the third umpire. So long as one of the umpires are sure that the ball has carried, the decision will stay on the field. Thats a protocol from the ICC, he said. (AGENICES)

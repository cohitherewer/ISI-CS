	Panaji: An engrossing battle is on the cards as a confident Churchill Brothers is preparing to lock horns with high-spirited Mohun Bagan in a crucial ONGC I-League football match at the Nehru Stadium in Margao on Wednesday.         
	Sporting Clube De Goa, Mohun Bagan and Churchill Brothers are the top three in the points table and are vying for the I-League title. A win in Wednesdays encounter for the either side will elevate them to the top of the ladder.         
	The visitors, who have played one match less than the Churchill, have 33 points - the same as the Goan outfit - and are two points behind the table-topper Sporting.         
	The triumphant journey of high flying Bagan, who won ten matches on the trot, was halted by East Bengal who scored a decisive 3-0 win to dent the morale of the former.         
	Mohun Bagan will certainly miss the service of skipper Bhaichung Bhutia, who will miss the match due to double booking. P C Lalwmpuiya, who scored the lone goal in Bagans win against Churchill at home, is likely to replace him.         
	Its a crucial match and we need to win if we are to stay in contention for the title. Bhutias absence will be felt as he is our leader and goal-getter, but we have plenty of options as we have youngsters, who are equally good, said Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa.         
	Its a tough match as Churchill have the advantage of playing at home. We need to play to our potential if we want to win, Bencharifa said.         
	With Odafe Okolie, who is the leading scorer of the tournament so far with 20 goals, in good form, Churchill have some clear edge over their rivals in the match.         
	The home teams success will highly depend on how well their wing-halves succeed in punching holes into their rivals crowded defence.         
	The Churchill camp is confident after the resounding 9-1 win against Vasco. My boys are fit and have no injury problems. I have warned them not to be complacent after the huge win, Churchill coach Zoran Dojerdevic said.         
	Its going to be a close contest as both teams are equally good, he added.

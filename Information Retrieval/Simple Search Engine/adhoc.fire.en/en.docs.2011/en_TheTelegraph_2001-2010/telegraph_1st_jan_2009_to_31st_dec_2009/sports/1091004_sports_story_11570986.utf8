                                                   Title for Maria
                      
	Tokyo: Crowd favourite Maria Sharapova captured her first title since her injury lay-off by beating Jelena Jankovic to win the Pan Pacific Open on Saturday.         
	The 22-year-old Russian, who returned to action in May after a right shoulder injury, won the battle between the former world No. 1s to regain the title she won in 2005, when the Serbian seventh seed retired with an arm injury at 5-2.         
	It was very tough because Jelena started off so strong. It was my second final of the year, so I was a little bit nervous, said Sharapova.         
	I wanted to perform really well. I feel like I played good enough tennis to give her a go and I just wanted to keep fighting out there.           (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis Khan falls on 313
                                                     Younis Khan falls on 313
                  Kamran Akmal in Karachi on Wednesday                     
	Karachi: Younis Khan hit 313 and Kamran Akmal chipped in with an unbeaten century to help Pakistan achieve a record total as the first Test against Sri Lanka ended in a draw on Wednesday.         
	The hosts declared at 765 for six on the fifth day before Sri Lanka finished on 144 for five, a lead of 23. It was the first time a side overhauled a 600-plus score first-innings score in a Test match. Younis, who was hoping to eclipse Brian Laras record of 400 was bowled.         
	Sri Lanka then slid to 45 for three in their second innings, seamer Umar Gul removing Malinda Warnapura for two and Tillekeratne Dilshan for eight while debutant Tharanga Paranavitana was run out for nine.         
	Meanwhile, Pakistan selectors named Shahid Afridi and Sohail Tanvir among five reserve players, and gave captain Younis Khan the option to include any one of them in for the second Test.

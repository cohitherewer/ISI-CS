The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Beckhams   message of intent
                                                   Beckhams   message of intent

	Rome: For one day only, Romes major attraction was not the Colosseum but the Stadio Olimpico where David Beckham on Sunday began the latest phase in a roller-coaster football career by making his Serie A debut for AC Milan.         
	At 33, his capacity to play a full match at the highest level has been questioned but he surprised just about everyone, including perhaps himself, to last 89 minutes of a 2-2 draw with Roma and send a clear message of intent to England manager Fabio Capello.         
	Beckhams popularity was also underlined and his presence swelled numbers in Romes 1960 Olympic Stadium to 50,000, while the press box contained some 400 journalists. His on-field contribution was somewhat less remarkable, though still impressive.         
	He has clearly been working extremely hard at his fitness since his last competitive match in October and there were more than enough glimpses of quality to suggest that he will equal Bobby Moores outfield record of 108 England caps against Spain in Seville on February 11.         
	Having indicated that Beckhams physical condition would preclude the possibility of a place in the starting line-up, Ancelotti sprung a surprise by dropping Mathieu Flamini and Massimo Ambrosini to start with the England captain.                     
	With Milan employing their usual 4-3-3 formation, Beckham was used on the right of a midfield three that also included Andrea Pirlo and Clarence Seedorf, while Ronaldinho, Pato and Kaka were encouraged to wreak havoc further forward.         
	Two goals apiece will ensure Pato and Mirko Vucini will get the majority of headlines in Italy, but Beckham was among Milans better players and fitted effortlessly into the team. Notable first-half moments included finding Pato and then Kaka with long trademark passes and, with his confidence noticeably growing, he tested Doni, Roma goalkeeper, with a second-half shot.         
	As Beckham himself has conceded, pace was never a major asset, but his other qualities, notably a determination to prove his critics wrong, remain intact.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No Nadal but lot at stake for Roger
                                                   No Nadal but lot at stake for Roger
                      
	Wimbledon: Roger Federer is building something of a reputation as an on-court crier, and he remembers well the first time he wept after winning a match.         
	It was July 2, 2001, at Wimbledon, the tournament that means more to him than any other. Federer was 19, up-and-coming and making his Centre Court debut in the fourth round when he stunned Pete Sampras, who was 29, seeded No. 1 and seeking an eighth Wimbledon title.         
	I used to cry almost after every single match I lost as a junior. Its not at all a feeling like its the end of the world  of course not, because tennis is not everything  but some people can control it, some people cant, Federer said. Crying after a victory is something that started when I beat Pete.                     
	Back then, Federer had yet to reach the semi-finals, let alone win a title, at any Grand Slam event. Eight years later, as Wimbledon begins Monday with a roof over Centre Court for the first time, Federer arrives at the All England Club bidding to break Samprass career record of 14 major championships.         
	And the complexion of Federers pursuit of a sixth Wimbledon title changed significantly Friday: He doesnt have to worry about dealing with his nemesis, defending champion Rafael Nadal, who withdrew from the tournament because of bad knees.         
	Nadals exit was the talk of the grounds Saturday, and Federer called it very disappointing for the tournament, and also for myself.         
	Its unfortunate. Im sad for him, because it must have been a very difficult decision to make, Federer said.         
	Ah, yes, last year, when Nadal reduced Federer to tears by winning the longest singles final in tournament history, a 4-hour, 48-minute test of skill and will that ended 9-7 in the fifth set as darkness descended. That 2008 setback ended Federers streaks of 40 consecutive wins at Wimbledon and 65 in a row on grass, and he is ready to start anew.         
	The focus is on the first round  and the first point, Federer said. Trying to regain my Wimbledon crown, I guess, stands over trying to beat Petes record right now.         
	There was something apt about the way Federer tied Sampras Grand Slam mark by completing a career Grand Slam at the French Open, a tournament the American never won and that the Swiss star came so close to winning, year after year, before finally breaking through this month.         
	There also would be something fitting if Federer surpasses Sampras at Wimbledon, a tournament that means so much to both men  and where their paths crossed all those years ago.         
	Many current players figure Federer is set to re-establish his supremacy at Wimbledon. As 2002 champion Lleyton Hewitt put it: Rogers going to be the one to beat.         
	The same must be said of the Williams sisters, particularly Venus. As has been the case with Federer in recent years, Wimbledon is their turf.         
	Venus has played in seven finals at the All England Club, winning five championships, including the past two. Serena has played in four finals, winning two. Pay no heed to the rankings, which have both sisters behind No. 1 Dinara Safina. Here are the numbers that really matter: Serena has won 10 Grand Slam titles overall, and Venus seven, while Marat Safins little sister is 0-3 in major finals.         
	Maria Sharapova, the 2004 Wimbledon champion, cant be counted out, even if her serve has been a trouble spot in her return from shoulder surgery, while a teenager such as Victoria Azarenka or Caroline Wozniacki  who won a grass-court title at Eastbourne on Saturday  could be ready for a breakthrough.         
	It seems far less likely that someone who isnt a household name will win the mens championship July 5.         
	For Federer, there are other laurels at stake this fortnight: He could match Nadals feat from 2008 of winning the French Open and Wimbledon in the same season - that hadnt been done since Bjorn Borg in 1980.         
	Plus, Federer can reclaim the No. 1 ranking, although he said that doesnt concern him.         
	Right now, he is focusing on adding to his haul of major championships. He bawled during the post-match ceremonies after another five-set setback against Nadal at the Australian Open this year, then shed tears of joy when he won the French Open.         
	Now comes Wimbledon.         
	I do think Im the favourite, actually, with the success Ive had and how close I came again last year, said Federer, whose wife is due to give birth to their first child this summer. Without any disrespect to any of the other players  because I think this years field is going to be very difficult to topple.         
	Those words were spoken before Nadal became only the second Wimbledon mens champion in 35 years to decide not to defend his title.         
	Federer said the rivals chatted briefly Wednesday, and Nadal congratulated him for winning the French Open.         
	I asked him how his knee was. He was, like, Its okay. So I kind of knew it wasnt great, because hes very honest to me, Federer said. So I knew something could be coming up. Federer had other men in mind, too, such as Andy Murray, the 22-year-old from Scotland who gives local fans a real chance for the first British male champion at the All England Club since Fred Perry in 1936.         
	In running down the list of contenders, Federer also named two-time Wimbledon finalist Andy Roddick (although that was before the American hurt his foot at Queens Club), 2008 Australian Open runner-up Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, and French Open runner-up Robin Soderling, who ended Nadals 31-match winning streak at Roland Garros.

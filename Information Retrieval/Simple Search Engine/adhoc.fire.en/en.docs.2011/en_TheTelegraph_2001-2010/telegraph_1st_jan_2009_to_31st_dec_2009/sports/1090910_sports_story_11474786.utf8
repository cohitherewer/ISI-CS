                                                     Vijender rolls with punches
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Vijender                           
	New Delhi: Olympic bronze medallist Vijender Singh, who stormed into the quarter finals on Tuesday night, is the lone Indian medal hope at the World Boxing Championships in Milan after Dinesh Kumar lost his last-eight light heavyweight tie Wednesday. Vijender had defeated Canadian boxer Steve Rolls in their middleweight category pre-quarter final match.         
	In the quarter final to be held late on Wednesday, the Haryana boxer will take on Sergiy Derevyanchenko of Ukraine in his bid to become the first Indian pugilist to win a world championship medal. Derevyanchenko defeated Adem Killici of Turkey in their pre-quarter final encounter.         
	Dinesh Kumar crashed out of the quarters after losing to Artur Beterbiev of Russia in a one-sided contest.         
	Pitted against Beterbiev, a former world championship silver medallist, Dinesh could offer little resistance and lost 3-5 when the referee stopped contest (RSC) in the second round. Beterbiev was a cut above in class and skill and the Russian was awarded a RSC (outclass) verdict.         
	In his weight category, Beterbiev is considered one of the best in the world, said G.S. Sandhu, the India coach. Losing against the Russian is no shame. I am satisfied that Dinesh fought spiritedly in the first two rounds, Sandhu added.         
	In the Vijender-Steve Rolls bout, the Indian found the going tough in the earlier rounds but made a determined comeback to score a 4-2 victory.         
	Given Vijenders track record and his ability to win regular points with quick punches, the Indians bout against Rolls was a surprisingly low-scoring affair. Initially, Vijender could hardly land punches at the right places and trailed 0-1 at the end of the opening round.         
	My opponent was short in height but had a brilliant defence, said Vijender from Milan. He kept up his guard very well and I had few chances of scoring points against him in the first round.         
	Things, however, were different in the second round as Vijender stepped up a gear to pick holes in the Canadians defence. I was able to get my jabs right and led 2-1 in the second round, said Vijender.         
	In the third, Vijender increased his lead by two more points and spent the final few seconds of the bout dodging his opponent with intelligent footwork, all the while making sharp jabs.         
	Yes, it was a low-scoring bout something quite unusual for me. But I am happy to have won in the end. I will now fully concentrate for a place in the semis, said Vijender.

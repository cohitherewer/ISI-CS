                                                   Inty, officials annoy Qadir
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan chief selector Abdul Qadir is unhappy with the interference from the national team coach and senior cricket board officials in selection committee matters and has raised the issue with the chairman Ezaj Butt.         
	Qadir met Butt on Tuesday and handed a letter in which the selectors have voiced concern over how coach Intikhab Alam and manager Yawar Saeed dropped fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar from the World Cup squad and included Rao Iftikhar without consulting them.         
	Qadir told the chairman at the meeting, also attended by the chairman of the junior selection committee Illyas Ahmed and director game development Aamer Sohail, that if the team management had to make such decisions then what was the purpose of having a national selection committee? one source said.         
	Shoaib was dropped from the squad after a medical panel of the board examined him and found he was suffering from genital viral warts and needed at least 10 to 12 days to recover.         
	The source said that hot words were also exchanged between Qadir and Illyas over the selection process for the Pakistan A teams tour of Australia later this year.         
	Illyas said it was the junior selection committee that should be selecting the A team and it should be made up of young players to which Qadir replied that his job was to concentrate on raising junior level teams and grooming young talent, the source said.         
	The former leg-spinner was also not happy with Butt, who had asked him to consult Sohail while picking the A team. At one point the chairman also gave a dressing down to Qadir for questioning many of his recent decisions and the fact that some very deserving players were being ignored for selection at the national and A team levels.         
	Butt reminded Qadir that while he didnt like to interfere in selection matters the selectors needed to be fair and unbiased in their decisions, the source said. (PTI)

                                                     EB drop Chetri, Paul
            A STAFF REPORTER            Subhas Bhowmick                           
	Calcutta: East Bengal Monday named 28 footballers, including two foreigners, in the squad for the upcoming season and said the club had decided not to chase big names and focus on junior players instead.         
	The list did not feature national football team regulars like goalkeeper Subrata Paul, midfielder Surkumar Singh and striker Sunil Chetri. The club said the final squad might see a couple of changes from the one announced on Wednesday. Four among the 28 named Wednesday  Mehrajuddin Wadoo, Govin Singh, Syed Rahim Nabi and Rennedy Singh  have made national coach Bob Houghtons list for the national camp.         
	We had decided on keeping a maximum of two to three national team players but unfortunately the AIFF has now named Govin Singh in their list and so it becomes four, coach Subhas Bhowmick said after Kalyan Majumdar, the secretary of the club, announced the list.         
	Ghanaian Yusif Yakubu and Edmilson Marques were named as the two foreigners. A decision on the third foreigner will be taken after the AIFF issues a guideline for the I-League teams to include a fourth foreigner (from Asia), the club said.         
	Foreigners bring trophies in India I am saying this with full responsibility. The difference in Indian football is made by the foreigners, Bhowmick said.         
	Asked if he was confident of winning trophies with his young squad, he said: Big names do not fetch trophies. The responsibility is mine If we do not perform, all blame will be on me. I had the 2002 squad in mind, when we won a lot of accolades with a young team. I have taken this challenge.         
	The East Bengal secretary informed the reporters that there was no controversy surrounding Snehashis Chakraborty and the IFA. The state governing body, has instructed the footballer to play for East Bengal or otherwise obtain a no objection certificate from them to sign for any other club.

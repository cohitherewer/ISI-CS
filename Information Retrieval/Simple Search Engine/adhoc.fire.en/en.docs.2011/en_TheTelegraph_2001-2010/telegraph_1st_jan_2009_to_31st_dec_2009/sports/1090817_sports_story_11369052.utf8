	London: After their mind-boggling recent spending Manchester City were ripe for a fall on Saturday but they responded with a 2-0 opening day victory at Blackburn Rovers.         
	Many people might have been looking to see if we were going to fall flat on our face on Saturday and I thought we gave a great response, Hughes said. You saw great character from City. If we continue to play with the character we showed on Saturday then we will keep progressing.         
	We stood up to the challenge and we showed the qualities we will need. There was a lot of pressure on us and it was just great to get started.         
	Meanwhile, Didier Drogba struck in stoppage time to mark Carlo Ancelottis first Premier League match in charge of Chelsea with a 2-1 victory over Hull City.         
	Ancelotti, who is Chelseas fifth manager in just under two years, said it would take time for his system to function properly and added they would need to improve. I do not know the time it will take for the players to get used to it, we have to work but it will take less time if we work like we have in the last month, he said.

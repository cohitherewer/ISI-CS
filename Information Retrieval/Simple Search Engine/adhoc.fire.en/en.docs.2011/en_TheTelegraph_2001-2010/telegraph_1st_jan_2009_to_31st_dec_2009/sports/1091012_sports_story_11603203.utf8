The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Glock to miss Brazil GP
                                                   Glock to miss Brazil GP
            DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Toyotas Timo Glock has been ruled out of this weeks Brazilian Grand Prix after tests revealed he sustained a cracked vertebra from his crash in Japan last weekend.         
	Toyota driver Glock was initially diagnosed with only a minor cut to his right leg following his accident in qualifying at Suzuka.         
	However, subsequent medical checks in Germany have now revealed another injury, ruling Glock out of the penultimate race of the year at Interlagos and potentially the season-ender on November 1 in Abu Dhabi.         
	The teams third driver, Kamui Kobayashi will now replace Glock in Brazil, as he did in Friday practice in Japan when the German was unwell.         
	Team principal John Howett said: Obviously everyone in the team is very disappointed and feels for Timo, and we wish him a very speedy recovery.         
	Based on the initial diagnosis, we fully expected Timo to return in Brazil, but unfortunately a different injury has been revealed which prevents that.         
	He will remain in Germany to recover and we hope he can recuperate in time for Abu Dhabi, although at this stage the situation is not clear.         
	Kamui was the natural choice to step in, and he proved in Suzuka that he is capable of holding his own.         
	It is a difficult task for him, but he knows the team will give him its complete support and we know he is motivated to make the most of this unexpected opportunity.         
	Kobayashis surprise call-up will double the number of Japanese drivers on the Interlagos starting grid next Sunday with Williams Kazuki Nakajima currently the countrys sole representative.         
	Nakajima has yet to score a point this season in 15 starts.         
	Glock finished second in his last race, the Singapore Grand Prix on September 27 but his future at Toyota had been uncertain before his accident with Howett suggesting that the team could opt for an all-new line-up in 2010.         
	Toyota have already allowed their option on Glock to lapse, with Howett saying in Suzuka Glock could still be in the car next year but the team wanted to keep their options open.

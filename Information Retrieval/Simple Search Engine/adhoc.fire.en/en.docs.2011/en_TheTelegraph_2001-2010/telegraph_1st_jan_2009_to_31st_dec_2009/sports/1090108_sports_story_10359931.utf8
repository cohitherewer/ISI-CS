The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pietersen calls it quits, Moores gets the axe
                                                     Pietersen calls it quits, Moores gets the axe
            TIMES ONLINE                Pietersen and Moores                             
	Andrew Strauss will lead England after Kevin Pietersen resigned as national captain on Wednesday only five months after his appointment.         
	The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said they have accepted Pietersens resignation and announced Strausss appointment through a press release.         
	Hugh Morris, managing director England cricket, said: I have an extremely high respect and regard for Kevin Pietersen but this has become an impossible situation given the irretrievable breakdown of the relationship between captain and coach.         
	With regard to Peter Moores, the board determined that he should relinquish his role as England team director.         
	I have the greatest respect for the dignity which Peter Moores has shown in recent days when he has found himself under extreme pressure. The ECB wishes him well in his future roles, Morris added.         
	Late on Wednesday evening, Pietersen confirmed his resignation after the total breakdown of his working relationship with Moores.         
	Contrary to media speculation today, I wish to make it very clear that I did not resign as captain of the England cricket team this morning, he said.         
	However, in light of recent communications with the ECB, and the unfortunate media stories and speculation that have subsequently appeared, I now consider that it would be extremely difficult for me to continue in my current position with the England cricket team. Accordingly, I have as of this afternoon decided to stand down as England captain with immediate effect.         
	Notwithstanding my resignation as England captain, I still fully intend to be a part of both Englands Test and one-day International squad to tour the West Indies next month and to do all I can to recapture the Ashes during the summer.         
	It is unclear whether the captain left the post of his own volition or was forced into a position which he felt was untenable.         
	I wish to add that I have principles in my professional and personal life as to how things are done and during my time as England captain I have always been both helpful and direct in my communications with the ECB, Pietersen continued. At no time, contrary to press speculation, have I released any unauthorised information to the media regarding my relationships with the players, coaches and the ECB itself.         
	I am extremely sad and disappointed to have to relinquish the captaincy at such an early stage, especially in a crucial year for English cricket, in such circumstances and particularly when I feel that I have much more to offer the England team as captain.         
	However, this decision will not affect my determination to continue playing international cricket for England, doing all I can to win matches for the team and supporting whoever captains the team in the future.         
	Confusion reigned for much of the morning over the positions of Pietersen and Moores after reports suggested both men had resigned. The ECB insisted they had no knowledge of either doing so but Pietersen is understood to have told his employers that he was not prepared to tour the West Indies later this month under the present management structure.         
	Moores assistant Andy Flower is likely to stand in for the head coach on an interim basis for Englands tour of the West Indies.         
	South African-born Pietersen had questioned Moores ability as a top international coach in a dispute that became public.         
	Officials had been keen to have the disagreement between the duo resolved before the England squad travelled to the Caribbean on January 21 for their four-Test tour.         
	Morris delivered his assessment to an emergency meeting of the ECB board on Tuesday night having taken soundings from Moores coaching staff as well as senior players.         
	Pietersen, who said on Sunday that differences needed to be settled before the squad departed for the Caribbean, is due to return from his holiday in Africa early Thursday morning.

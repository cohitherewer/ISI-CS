The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shiv slips to tied 6th
                                                                                                                       7                                      Shiv slips to tied 6th
                      
	Siem Reap: On a day when sub-par cards came at a premium, Shiv Kapurs fortunes also took a tumble as he turned in a two-over 74 to slip to the tied sixth spot after the penultimate round of the Johnnie Walker Cambodian Open golf meet Saturday.         
	Overnight tied second, Kapur is, however, still in the hunt for a top-five finish with a total of five-under 211, which is just five shots behind leader Craig Smith (71) of Wales.         
	Other Indians in the fray couldnt break par either with overnight joint 13th Vikrant Chopra sliding to the tied 28th spot.         
	Chopra, who returned a 75, is one-under overall and shares the 28th spot with, among others, compatriot Rahil Gangjee (73).

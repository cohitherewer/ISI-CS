	Karachi: Pakistans Younis Khan on Tuesday agreed to join teammates in Australia for the ongoing Test series but said he will never captain the side.         
	The Pakistan team management had requested Younis to join the team to bolster the batting line-up.         
	According to sources, chief selector Iqbal Qasim spoke to Younis about the request and the senior batsman agreed to fly to Australia but was firm on his decision of not leading the side in future.         
	Qasim spoke to Younis today (Tuesday) to find out his availability for the Australian tour and Younis made it clear to him that he was willing to fly out immediately but only as a ordinary member of the team, one source said.           (PTI)

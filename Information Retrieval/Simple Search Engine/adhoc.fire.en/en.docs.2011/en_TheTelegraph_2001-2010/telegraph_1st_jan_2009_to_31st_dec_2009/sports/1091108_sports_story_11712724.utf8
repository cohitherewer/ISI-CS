	Abu Dhabi: New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori believes his teams conscious effort to improve in key areas helped them beat Pakistan and level the three-match series at 1-1.         
	They may have been beaten by 138-runs in the first match on Tuesday but the Black Caps hit back with a clinical performance in the second Friday to win by 64 runs  a turnaround which delighted the New Zealand captain.         
	I think we wanted to improve on some key areas, made a conscious effort and its pleasing that we were able to turn around in a couple of days; now we must keep the pressure on Pakistan, said Vettori after the win.

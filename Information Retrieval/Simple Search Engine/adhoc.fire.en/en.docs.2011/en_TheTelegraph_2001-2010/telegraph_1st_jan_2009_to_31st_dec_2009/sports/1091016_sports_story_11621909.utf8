                                                     Bhutia seeks advice in Chennai
            A STAFF REPORTER            Bhaichung Bhutia                           
	Calcutta: Bothered by a nagging hamstring problem on his right leg and desperate to be fully fit for the I-Leagues October 25 clash against Mohun Bagan, East Bengals star striker and national skipper Bhaichung Bhutia rushed to Chennai to consult Dr Kannan Pugazhendi, a sports medicine doctor with the YMCA Physical Educations clinic. Bhutia will return on Friday morning. Bhutia in fact calls Dr Kannan a magician after he treated him for a similar problem during Mohun Bagans 2006 Federation Cup triumph.         
	Bhutia was then suffering for excruciating pain and played the tournament with a strapped right leg and Dr Kannans magical touch gave him the much-needed relief.         
	I know him for a quite a long time and whenever he has sought my services I was always there to help him out, Dr Kannan said from Chennai.         
	Dr Kannan though refused to divulge whether the injury is serious enough to rule him out of the crunch tie. Its too early, he said.         
	Sources in East Bengal said that Bhutias hamstring problem aggravated after the match against JCT on the artificial turf of the Salt Lake Stadium. Thankfully there is a two-week gap and hopefully he will be able to recover, the source added.         
	Its not just East Bengal who are fretting over fitness of key players. Even Mohun Bagan are in a spot of bother with Jose Ramirez Barreto yet to start practising after limping out of the Chirag United match.         
	Bagan thinktank are hoping that the talismanic Brazilian will start from October 20.         
	Even the Palestinian central defender Yousef Mezyan who is on trials has not really impressed coach Karim Bencharifa.         
	He did not attend Thursdays morning practice session due to stomach upset. With Dipak Mondal not available for the derby clash, will Bagan go ahead with Mezyan? Doubts persist though.         
	Meanwhile, Mohun Bagan dashed off a letter to the AIFF Thursday complaining about the parent bodys decision to fine defender Dipak Mondal Rs 10000 besides upholding a two-match suspension.

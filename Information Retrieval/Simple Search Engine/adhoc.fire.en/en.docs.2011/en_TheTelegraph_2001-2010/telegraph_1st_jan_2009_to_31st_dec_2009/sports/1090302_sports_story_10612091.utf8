The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Villa, Stoke feature in a thriller
                                                   Villa, Stoke feature in a thriller
                      
	London: Fourth-placed Aston Villa threw away a 2-0 lead in the last three minutes to draw 2-2 at home to relegation-threatened Stoke City in the Premier League on Sunday.         
	The draw left Villa six points clear of Arsenal in the race for Englands fourth Champions League berth and three points adrift of second-placed Chelsea and Liverpool. Manchester United are seven points clear at the top with a game in hand.         
	Bulgarian Stilian Petrov put Villa ahead on the stroke of halftime and John Carew added their second in the 79th, only three minutes after replacing Emile Heskey.         
	Stoke then grabbed what looked like a consolation goal through Ryan Shawcross in the 87th before Glenn Whelan struck the equaliser in stoppage time. The draw still left Stoke deep in trouble, dropping to 19th place after Blackburn Rovers beat Hull City 2-1 to claw their way out of the bottom three on goal difference.

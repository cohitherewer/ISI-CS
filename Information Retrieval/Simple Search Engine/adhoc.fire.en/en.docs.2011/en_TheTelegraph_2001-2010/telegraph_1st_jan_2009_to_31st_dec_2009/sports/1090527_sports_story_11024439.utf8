                                                     Ponting and Co. take it easy ahead of long tour

	Coolum (Australia): Just over 24 hours away from departing for a five-month tour of England, Australias top cricketers were gathered at a five-star luxury resort for a mixture of business and pleasure, along with their wives, partners and children.         
	While Cricket Australia general manager Michael Brown conducted player contract and assessment interviews with most of the players at the three-day camp, other group sessions included the same family members who will be more than welcome on the teams England tour that includes, in order, the World Twenty20, the five-Test Ashes series and a limited-overs series.         
	A few of the more boisterous children of the players could be heard Tuesday in the main lobby of the hotel. While the skies were cloudy and drizzling rain was frequent, it seemed no one minded. At the end of the pre-tour news conference, Australia captain Ricky Ponting hopped on his bicycle to ride along the paved paths at the resort back to his familys villa.         
	Before we embark on what is a very big tour for us, weve got some time to get together as a team and with our families, Ponting said. Im on my fourth Ashes tour, so Ive been around the block a few times. Its important that we focus and be in the best shape we can. We know all about the hype of the Ashes.         
	Pontings first trip to England for the Ashes as captain in 2005 resulted in the English winning back the coveted urn for the first time since 1989. It was a major upset, and contributed to Australian greats Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath extending their Test careers, seeking to avenge the loss. Australia regained the Ashes convincingly in 2006-07, a 5-0 Test whitewash in Australia. Much of that team is now in retirement.         
	This time, Ponting is among only five players who were on the 2005 touring squad, which might be a good thing. The Australians are sending their least experienced side in two decades.         
	Ponting says hell be using his experience to help educate the rookies  more than half the squad have never played an Ashes Test. It will be important for me to get to those younger guys, and tell them what to expect when we arrive, Ponting said. Some of us senior guys who have been around before need to get the younger guys well-versed on what to expect.         
	Before too long, Ponting was asked to defend the non-selection of veteran allrounder Andrew Symonds for the Ashes squad. Symonds, who has not played for Australia since the end of 2008 due to a combination of injuries and off-field issues, is in the Twenty20 squad but didnt make the Ashes 16-man line-up.         
	Now-retired Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist, who captained the Deccan Chargers to the Indian Premier League Twenty20 title in South Africa with Symonds stellar help with the bat and ball, said Symonds would have been in his Ashes team.         
	I think the selectors picked our best 16 players, Ponting said. There was lot made of the comment I made the day before the actual team was announced about Andrew maybe being selected in the side or not being selected in the side.         
	The facts are that unfortunately for him, he didnt make that final 16. Andrew is a very, very good cricketer, and hes been a lot of fun to have around the team over a long time. The facts are right now hes not in our Test squad.         
	Cricket Australia has asked England for permission to use an extra man in Ashes warm-up matches to help solve some selection issues. (AP)

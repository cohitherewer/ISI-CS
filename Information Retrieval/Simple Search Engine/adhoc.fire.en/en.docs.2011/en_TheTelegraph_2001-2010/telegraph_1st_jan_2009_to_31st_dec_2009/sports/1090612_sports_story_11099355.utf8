                                                   England women maul India
                      
	Taunton: India eves began their Twenty20 World Cup campaign on a dismal note after hosts England spanked them by ten wickets in their pool B match here Thursday.         
	England were clinical as they first restricted India to a meagre 112 and then overhauled the target with 4.2 overs to spare.         
	The hosts openers Charlotte Edwards (61) and Sarah Taylor (50) smashed scintillating unbeaten half-centuries to lead the 50-over World Cup winners to a comprehensive win.         
	Mithali Raj (24) and Sulakashna Naik (24) had earlier saved India from the blushes and it was because of them that India crawled past the 100-run mark. (PTI)

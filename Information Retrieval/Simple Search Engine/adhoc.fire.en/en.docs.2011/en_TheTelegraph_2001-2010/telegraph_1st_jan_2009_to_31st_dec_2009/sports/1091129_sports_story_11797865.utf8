The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ballack: Learn lessons from Enke 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Ballack: Learn lessons from Enke 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES            Michael Ballack                           
	Michael Ballack has spoken of his feeling of helplessness over the death of Germany teammate Robert Enke and urged the football world to learn lessons from the tragedy.         
	Enke, whose baby daughter Lara died from a rare heart defect in 2006, took his own life on November 10 after a six-year battle against depression.         
	His wife Teresa later admitted the goalkeeper feared their adopted daughter Leila may be taken from them if his illness was ever made public.         
	We never had the feeling that he had a problem like this, Ballack told an English daily.         
	To not know that he has depression  that makes you feel helpless because you cant change it. This is a bad, bad thing. On Tuesday evening when we got the message in the team hotel, it was a shock.         
	There was quietness and a lot of tears. Afterwards it was really good to give him the attention, to be able to say goodbye to him, to join the memorial.         
	I was there in the church with the team and the manager.         
	Ballack wants any other players in a similar predicament to not be afraid to speak out.         
	Its happened but I think we have to learn from this, added the Chelsea midfielder.         
	There is the illness but also the combination with football and being famous.         
	He was scared to speak about his problem because he was scared to lose his child, or his job. Or to confess to having a weakness to other players.         
	People have weaknesses, we should accept it.         
	Enkes suicide had shocked his country and triggered a national debate about the concealment of mental illness in high-profile sport.         
	The day after Enke took his own life, Teresa had said: When he was acutely depressive it was difficult. Difficult above all because he didnt want anything to get out. he was terrified of losing his sport. he thought there was no hope of a recovery on the horizon for him.         
	The 30-year-old told how her husband was most afraid that their adoption of a newborn baby would be overturned by the authorities if his depression became public knowledge.         
	Enkes widow had appeared at a press conference organised by Enkes club Hannover 96.         
	Although officials stressed that it was her decision to talk to reporters less than 24 hours after the suicide, it was plain that the club wanted to demonstrate that they had not put Enke under pressure or encouraged him to hide his illness. They were simply unaware of a problem.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indian coaches equally good, says Sourav
                                                   Indian coaches equally good, says Sourav
                      
	New Delhi: Despite seven of the eight IPL franchises opting for foreign coaches, Sourav Ganguly reckons that Indian coaches have the credentials to do a good job and foresees a bigger contribution from them in future editions.         
	I feel Indian coaches are good enough and they should have an equal role to play as the overseas coaches in the IPL, Ganguly said.         
	Currently, only Mumbai Indians have Praveen Amre as their coach while all other teams are guided by those from overseas such as John Buchanan, Shane Warne, Tom Moody and Greg Shipperd.         
	I know most of the teams have overseas coaches, and sometimes I dont know whats the reason for it Im sure someone like Lalchand Rajput, hes been a part of a Twenty20 World Cup winning team, and so he can do a good job, Sourav told a TV channel.         
	I think a time will come when there will be a mixture of both, but the important thing is it should be judged completely on the basis of how good one is, he added. (PTI)

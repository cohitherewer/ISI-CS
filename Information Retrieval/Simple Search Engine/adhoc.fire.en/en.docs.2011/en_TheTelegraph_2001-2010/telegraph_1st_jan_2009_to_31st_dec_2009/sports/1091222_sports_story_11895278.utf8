The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Viru: Didnt expect so much from Ravindra
                                                                                                                       7                                      Viru: Didnt expect so much from Ravindra
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Cuttack: Stand-in captain Virender Sehwag was all praise for Ravindra Jadeja, who won the Man of the Match award for his four for 32, at the post-match media conference on Monday.               
	The following are the excerpts               
	Jadeja rising to the occasion         
	Ravindra was magnificent today. When he came in to bowl, Lankans were scoring freely. He not only checked the flow of runs but also took four wickets for 32 runs. I couldnt have expected more from a youngster.         
	Tendulkar being seen in a different avatar         
	He has played the game for 20 years. He knows the need of the hour and can mould his game according to the demands of the situation.         
	If Sangakkaras dismissal was the turning point         
	I think, we bowled outstandingly in the middle-overs, between the 25th and 35th overs. Jadeja along with Harbhajan got us back into the match. I must also mention Ishant Sharmas effort. He showed big heart to come back after getting hit in his first spell. Their batting collapsed in a heap and the target of 240 was achieveable.         
	Dilshan not scoring too many         
	If you guys remember we even won when Dilshan scored 160. But yes, its always good to get an in-form batsman. Ashish Nehra really got us a good breakthrough. They were scoring at 12 per over when Ashish came in to bowl. Actually, it was conscious decision on my part to use Ashish as one-change. Ishant bowled well during the T20 Internationals and once got Dilshan out cheaply. So we tried to use him as an opening bowler.         
	On the slow over-rate         
	Yes, there was a fear at the back of our minds as we bowled only 17 overs at the time when we should have completed 20 overs. Then I thought that I would quickly put in a few overs to again get the over-rate back on track. I got Sangakkara in the bargain.         
	Yuvraj fielding with one hand         
	You should ask Yuvraj as to why he fielded with one hand.         
	If the fielding was better when Robin Singh was the fielding coach         
	We even missed catches and misfielded when he was there.

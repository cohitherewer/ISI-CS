                                                     Houghton optimistic
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bhaichung Bhutia                           
	New Delhi: The Indian football team will play their first match in five months when they take on hosts Hong Kong in a friendly outing at the Mong Kok Stadium on Wednesday.         
	The team, led by Bhaichung Bhutia, have not played since they beat Tajikistan in the historic AFC Challenge Cup final in Delhi to qualify for the Asia Cup after 24 years.         
	Against Hong Kong, coach Bob Houghton is likely to make two changes from the team that thrashed Tajikistan last August. While debutant Anthony Pereira is set to take Rennedy Singhs place on the left of midfield, Deepak Mondal will fill in for an injured Surkumar Singh in the defence.         
	Pereira has been performing consistently for Vasco and Dempo in the domestic circuit for the past few seasons. According to Dempo coach Armando Colaco, the midfielder was the star player for his team in the AFC Cup recently.         
	Houghton, however, has plans to send in Rennedy later in the match. The team has practised hard for the friendly and is in good form, the national coach said.         
	Both Bhaichung and Rennedy are fit to play Wednesdays match. They will not be playing for 90 minutes but will certainly take the field, Houghton added.         
	Houghton is confident that India will continue their winning run against Hong Kong.         
	The players have been playing in the I-League and the Federation Cup and there is no reason they cannot overcome their opponents. But then, Hong Kong are a good side and we cannot take them lightly, the British coach maintained.         
	Hong Kong are placed below India in the Fifa rankings but they have three players of foreign origin in the squad. While Lawrence Akandu is from Nigeria, Cristiano Cordeiro and Gerard Guy are from Brazil and Cameroon respectively. The team is coached by Dejan Antonic.         
	An Indian team official said the weather could pose some problems for the visitors.         
	The temperature here is below 15 degrees. Before coming here, we practised in Goa where the temperature is much higher, he said.         
	The match will start at 5:30 pm IST.

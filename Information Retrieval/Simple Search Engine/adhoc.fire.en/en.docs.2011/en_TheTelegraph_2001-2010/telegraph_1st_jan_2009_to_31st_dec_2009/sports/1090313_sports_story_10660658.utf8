The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arsenal shoot Roma down
                                                   Arsenal shoot Roma down
                      
	Paris/London: English clubs completed a clean sweep of four teams into the Champions League quarter finals following a cliffhanger shootout victory by Arsenal against Roma.         
	Defending champions Manchester United beat Inter Milan, and on Tuesday Liverpool and Chelsea had booked their passage.         
	When Max Tonetto shot high over the bar Wednesday it gave Arsenal passage into the last eight 7-6 on penalties after the match ended 1-0, 1-1 on aggregate, after extra time.         
	Barcelonas Thierry Henry scored his 49th and 50th goals in the competition, putting him fourth in the all time list, as Barcelona beat French champions Lyon 5-2 at the Nou Camp stadium.         
	Porto and Atletico finished goalless in Lisbon but the 2-2 draw in the first leg in Spain meant Porto went through on away goals.         
	The eight teams which go into the Friday March 20 draw are Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Villarreal, Porto and Barcelona, with no Italian team for the first time in seven years.         
	Earlier Tuesday, Liverpool tore Real Madrid apart with a blistering 4-0 win to reach the Champions League quarter finals while Premier League rivals Chelsea drew 2-2 with Juventus in Turin to progress 3-2 on aggregate.         
	Bayern Munich cantered into the last eight by routing Portugals Sporting 7-1 in Germany and 12-1 over the two legs for a Champions League aggregate record victory, eclipsing Olympique Lyons 10-2 demolition of Werder Bremen home and away in the corresponding round of the 2004-05 competition.         
	Spains Villarreal won 2-1 in Athens against Panathinaikos to edge the tie 3-2.         
	Real, 1-0 down from the first leg, had no answers to a scintillating attacking display at Anfield from Liverpool who condemned the Spaniards to a last-16 exit for the fifth successive season.

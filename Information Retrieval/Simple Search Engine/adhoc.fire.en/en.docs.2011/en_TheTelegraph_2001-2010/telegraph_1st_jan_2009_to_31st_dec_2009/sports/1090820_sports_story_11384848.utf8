            STAR RACER                         
	Calcutta: There are only five horses in the running for Thursdays main event, the 1,400m No Regrets Cup, a terms race for four-year-olds and over. Yet, the winner spotting seems to be a strenuous task. Arktouros is out to level scored having lost twice to Samarkhand in past. Rockefeller, on the other hand, is known to produce his best the first time out. Bountiful Talent and Hugo Boss are no pushovers. They take all by a surprise when least expected. Therefore, it may pay to follow the trusted galloper Samarkhand who is going over his favourite trip.          
	The 1,800m Swatantrata Cup may see trainer Vikash Jaiswals ward Betelgeuse coming good in the hands of Rajinder. The in-form jockey takes on the likes of Shabbanis and Tamangs who are riding good handicapped horses like Flaming Comet and Simply Perfect respectively.

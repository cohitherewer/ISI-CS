                                                     Upbeat Indians raring to go 
  - Virat Kohli to replace Gambhir who returns home with a groin injury       A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Ishant Sharma in Colombo on Thursday                                 
	Calcutta/Colombo: Team Indias quest to become the worlds No. 1 one-day International team suffered a big jolt with opener Gautam Gambhir, being ruled out of the tri-series on the eve of their opening match against New Zealand.         
	Delhi batsman Virat Kohli will replace Gambhir, who suffered a groin injury, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said in a release on Thursday.         
	According to the statement, Gambhir will return home as he has been prescribed a 10-day rest. Twenty-year-old Kohli will join the team at the earliest as the replacement. With the destructive Virender Sehwag and pace spearhead Zaheer Khan already sidelined due to injuries, India have been further depleted with the inform Gambhir joining the casualty list.         
	The setback to Gambhir could not come at a more inopportune time and it will no doubt disturb the combination at the top of the order.This means, the experienced Sachin Tendulkar and Dinesh Karthik, who has opened the innings in recent times, could take up the responsibility.         
	The tag of the No. 1 team will be the main goal for Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men, who need to win both their league matches and the final to achieve the feat.         
	The Sahara BCCI Corporate Trophy provided the Indian players a chance to shrug off the rust following a six-week break even though the fitness of the players were assessed during the off-season.         
	The Indians are raring to get back onto the field and coach Gary Kirsten has already drawn up a road map for the team. We have set our targets as to what we have to achieve in the next eight months. Certainly, one of them is to become the best team in the world. We are heading that way and we are very excited on the way that we have gone about our business to get to that position, Kirsten said.         
	We know that if we continue with as hard as we do in terms of our training and how we set our sights for games, we have the best chances of reaching there. We continue with that quest to be the best in the world, the South African added.         
	If India win the two league matches and then the final, they will earn two rating points, which is enough to topple South Africa who are currently on top of the table.         
	While the Indians appear to be quite confident, it will be a do-or-die battle for the Black Caps, who were thrashed by the hosts in the opening match. A defeat against India will dash their hopes of a berth in the final.         
	But New Zealand, who have been strengthened by the return of Shane Bond and Daryl Tuffey from the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL), are a dangerous one-day team quite capable of turning the table on any fancied team on their day.         
	Though Dhoni will be without Sehwag, the return of veteran Rahul Dravid lends solidity to the middle-order. The Indians have young all-rounder Abhishek Nayar in their ranks and it remains to be seen whether the team management decides to give him a chance to prove his worth.         
	The way Sri Lankan pacers Nuwan Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga and Thilan Thushara performed in the first match Indians would be tempted to play three pacers.         
	Both Harbhajan Singh and Amit Mishra are expected to play on the spin-friendly pitches of Sri Lanka wickets but there is stiff competition in the pace department.         
	Left-armer Ashish Nehra looks sure after a good comeback in the last series against the West Indies in July and it would be a surprise if he is omitted from the final line-up. Probably Praveen Kumar will sit out as his success hinges much on swing, which he is unlikely to get from the tracks here and Ishant Sharma and RP Singh would be the favourites to start.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: South Africas loss turned out to be Indias gain as the Proteas, after a 1-2 series defeat against England at home, slipped one place from the second spot in the Reliance Mobile ICC ODI rankings released Saturday.         
	India, who were in the third place, thus jumped a spot to be second with 122 ratings points.         
	With India to go head to head with Sri Lanka in the five-match ODI series, which begins in Rajkot from December 15, there could be more reshuffling depending on the result of the series.         
	A 5-0 clean sweep will take India to 126 ratings points, four behind Australia, while Sri Lankas 5-0 series win will put both the sides on 115 ratings points. Sri Lankas 3-2 series win will lift them to 110 ratings points and will drop India to 119 ratings points, but they will still be ahead of South Africa.         
	World champions Australia continue to enjoy a comfortable eight-point advantage over India but the middle of the table is quite congested with only 13 ratings points separating third-placed South Africa with seventh-placed Sri Lanka.         
	Englands series victory, have earned them three ratings points which has helped them go ahead of Pakistan in the fifth position. In the player rankings for ODI batsmen, India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni still leads the chart followed by Mike Hussey of Australia.         
	Yuvraj Singh is in the seventh position while Sachin Tendulkar shares the eighth spot with South Africa captain Graeme Smith.

                                                                                                                       7                                        Lorgat: I dont want to pre-empt justice 
  - CEO says if Kotla incident warrants a sanction, ICC would go ahead       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Haroon Lorgat in New Delhi on Monday.   A Telegraph picture                                       
	New Delhi: Stung by Sundays pitch fiasco at the Kotla, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has asked the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to explain what exactly went wrong, leading to the abandonment of the tie.         
	ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said on Monday, that the BCCI had been asked to respond within 14 days. Lorgat, however, refused to be dragged into any speculation on what action could be taken against the DDCA for preparing a poor pitch.         
	We did toughen our stand after the event in Antigua. If yesterday (Sunday)s incident in Delhi warrants sanction, we would abide by that, said Lorgat.         
	I would not like to speculate on the outcome or on whether Kotla would lose the right to host 2011 World Cup matches. The process must continue and I dont want to pre-empt justice, Lorgat told a crowded news conference.         
	In such cases, the first thing is for the Match Referee to file a report on the pitch and the outfield. This is a standard procedure for all international matches  Tests, ODIs or Twenty20s. When we receive that report and see that there are some concerns, we write back to the host Board, Lorgat said.         
	The ICC boss said once ICC received the Indian Boards reply, chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle and ICC general manager (cricket) Dave Richardson will review the report and decide on appropriate action.         
	If it warrants sanction, they would determine what would be the appropriate sanction, said Lorgat.         
	He indicated that it might take a month for the process to be completed. I havent seen anything and I dont want to interfere in the process.         
	We just have to be patient and let the process take its course, he said.         
	Lorgat said he did not think that the general condition of pitches in India is poor.         
	It is a very general statement to say that pitches in India are sub-standard, Lorgat said. My answer to that is no What happened Sunday was a bad example but generally speaking India has got quality pitches.         
	Asked about the power cut at Eden Gardens, during the fourth India-Sri Lanka ODI, Lorgat said: It does worry when things dont work 100 per cent but its for the host Board, the BCCI in this case, to decide.         
	As to Wada, Lorgat said: The current status is that we are working with key member Boards like India to resolve the practical problem of whereabouts of the players.         
	We have made some progress and will put some proposal at our next executive committee meeting.             The Telegraph story, on how the Board of Control for Cricket in India could use its financial clout to shift the ICC headquarters from Dubai to India, specifically Mumbai, has been picked up by newspapers in the UK, home of ICC president David Morgan.  The story, published on November 22, 2009, said the proposal to shift the HQ back to   London was actually an eyewash and that a bigger game was probably being played out

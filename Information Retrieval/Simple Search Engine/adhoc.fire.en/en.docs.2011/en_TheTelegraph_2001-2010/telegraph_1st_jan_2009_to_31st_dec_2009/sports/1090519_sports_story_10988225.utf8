                                                   Bhutia on agenda as EB go into a huddle
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutias decision to part ways with Mohun Bagan has swung his first love and Bagans archrivals East Bengal into action. The club have called an emergency executive committee meeting on Tuesday to discuss the Bhaichung affair. Coach Subhas Bhowmick, presently in England, will be on conference call. While the official version was that the meeting has been called to discuss transfer-related matters, sources said the Bhaichung affair would be high on the agenda.         
	East Bengal, in fact were not aware of Bhaichungs decision. We never thought he would go that far. And when he decided to sever ties with Bagan, the prospect of him donning the red and gold jersey once again cannot be ruled out, the source added.         
	Bhaichung, for the record, is a free player as the Rs 10-lakh transfer pact between the two United Breweries-sponsored clubs, which is applicable for others, will not come into effect if he decides to cross over. It will also be a reunion with Bhowmick under whom Bhaichung and East Bengal won the Asean Cup in 2003.         
	Bhaichungs love for East Bengal is known to all. Bhaichung has some fantastic performances for the club from where he began his successful journey in 1992. Whether it be the famous 4-1 drubbing of Bagan in Fed Cup 1997 or the Asean Cup triumph, Bhaichung looked a different proposition wearing the red and gold colours.         
	He also shares a very cordial relationship with the clubs football secretary Santosh Bhattacharya. It might be mentioned that early in 2008 when Sikkim was welcoming their first Padmashri, an associate of Bhattacharya was there to seal deals with Bhaichungs India teammates Sunil Chetri, Rennedy Singh, N.P. Pradeep and Steven Dias.         
	They were in Gangtok to play an exhibition match and the connection between Bhaichung, Bhattacharya and those four was very obvious. That Pradeep and Dias later couldnt get release orders from Mahindra United was another story.         
	There is also mutual hatred between the player and the club. Bhaichungs decision to join Bagan in 2006 so incensed East Bengal that they removed his photo from the club tent. Bhaichung, in turn, was critical of the politics in the East Bengal dressing room. Whether love will triumph over hatred and whether East Bengal will be able to deal with the economics of signing a player of Bhaichungs stature, remain to be seen.         
	Meanwhile, the Maidan reacted sharply as the news of Bhaichungs intention came out. Its unfortunate, said striker Dipendu Biswas. Players like Bhaichung can never be treated like this. Bagan could have settled the matter amicably, echoed India team manager Pradip Choudhury.

	London: Premier League sides Manchester United and Aston Villa reached the fourth round of the FA Cup on Sunday after seeing off lower league opponents Southampton and Gillingham respectively.         
	United beat Championship (division two) strugglers Southampton, who played for almost an hour with 10 men, 3-0 at St Marys Stadium and will now meet Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford in the fourth round.         
	Aston Villa won 2-1 at League Two (fourth division) Gillingham with James Milner celebrating his 23rd birthday by scoring both goals.         
	Villa will travel to play the winners of the postponed tie between Cheltenham Town and Doncaster Rovers in the fourth round in three weeks time.         
	United, who were last beaten in the third round of the FA Cup 25 years ago, weathered some early pressure from Southampton but the outcome was rarely in doubt after Danny Welbeck headed home from two metres out in the 20th minute.         
	Southampton were in more trouble 16 minutes later when teenage defender Matthew Paterson was sent off by referee Mike Riley for a studs-up challenge on United defender Nemanja Vidic although the challenge hardly troubled the Serbia defender.         
	United effectively wrapped the tie up in the 48th minute after Riley made another controversial decision, ruling that David McGoldrick had handled a Nani freekick when the ball appeared to hit his back. Nani duly converted the penalty. Substitute Darron Gibson scored Uniteds third after 81 minutes.         
	Villa were made to work hard for their victory at Gillingham, who won the praises of Villa manager Martin Neill.         
	Never for one minute did I feel comfortable. Gillingham were always in the game even when we were leading 1-0.         
	Milner put the visitors ahead with a superb strike after 13 minutes after playing a clever one-two with Stilian Petrov, but Gillinghams endeavour paid off after 57 minutes when they equalised through Canadian international Simeon Jackson who blasted an unstoppable shot past Brad Friedel.         
	Villa though, regained the lead with 11 minutes to play when Milner scored from a penalty after Gills skipper Adam Miller was adjudged by referee Keith Stroud to have brought down Ashley Young.         
	Meanwhile, Premier League leaders Liverpool will host Merseyside neighbours Everton while Manchester United will face Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford in the fourth round of the FA Cup following the draw made on Sunday.         
	Liverpool and Everton have met 20 times in the competition including the finals of 1986 and 1989, both of which Liverpool won.         
	Portsmouth, who went on to win the FA Cup last season, were held to a goalless draw by Championship (second division) Bristol City on Saturday and will face either minor league Histon or Swansea City of the Championship if they win the replay at Ashton Gate.         
	Cardiff City, last seasons beaten finalists, were drawn at home to Arsenal, the club they beat in the final in 1927 when they won the FA Cup for the only time.         
	Chelsea, held to a surprise 1-1 draw by Southend United on Saturday, were drawn at home against Championship side Ipswich Town, if they win their replay.         
	Hartlepool United were rewarded for knocking out Premier League Stoke City on Saturday with another home tie against Premier League opposition, this time West Ham United.         
	Nottingham Forest, who scored the upset of the day when they beat Premier League side Manchester City 3-0 on Saturday, were drawn against local rivals Derby County, whose former manager Billy Davies officially takes over at Forest on Monday.         
	There is also likely to be another all-Premier League tie between Sunderland and Blackburn Rovers, who meet minor league Blyth Spartans on Monday.         
	The two minor League sides definitely through to the fourth round were both handed home ties with Torquay United playing Coventry City and Kettering Town hosting Premier League Fulham.         
	The ties are due to be played on the weekend of Jan 24-25 with the final at Wembley on May 30.           (REUTERS)

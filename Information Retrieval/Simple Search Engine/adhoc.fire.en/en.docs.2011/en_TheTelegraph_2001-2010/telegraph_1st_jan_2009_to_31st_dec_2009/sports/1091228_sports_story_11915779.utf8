The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England off to a good start
                                                                                                                       7                                      England off to a good start
                      
	Durban: Andrew Strauss scored a combative half-century as England reached 103 for one when bad light ended play on Day II of the second Test against South Africa at Kingsmead on Sunday.         
	Strausss 54 eased Englands blushes after a last-wicket stand of 56 from South Africa took them to 343 all out in their first innings.         
	The England left-handers bold total came off 67 balls and included nine fours.         
	The frustrated South African attack eventually claimed Strausss wicket in the fifth over after tea when Morne Morkel bowled him .         
	Fellow opener Alastair Cook made a slow start but then blossomed to reach the close on 31 not out, while Jonathan Trott was not shy to play his strokes as he ended the day on 17.         
	Dale Steyn had scored an exuberant 47 as South Africas first innings came to a rousing end.         
	Captain Graeme Smith, Jacques Kallis and AB de Villiers scored top-class half-centuries after South Africa had won the toss and elected to bat on a lively pitch.         
	On a day which was played entirely under floodlights, Graeme Swann finished with four for 110 in 35 overs to take his years haul to 49 wickets in 12 Tests. (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadia knocks Serena out
                                                   Nadia knocks Serena out
                      
	Beijing: Serena Williams was knocked out in the third round of the $6.6m China Open by Nadia Petrova on Thursday, leaving the event without any of the top three seeds in the quarter finals.         
	The American lost 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 in a hard-fought contest against the Russian 13th seed to join her third-seeded sister Venus and top seed Dinara Safina in exiting the tournament.         
	Earlier, mens top seed Rafael Nadal was delighted with his form and fitness after negotiating a tricky second-round tie against American James Blake to reach the last eight.         
	Nadal, playing his first tournament since picking up an abdominal injury at the US Open, was not at his rampaging best but certainly proved his fitness by outlasting Blake 7-5, 6-7, 6-3.         
	Former world No. 1 Marat Safin, who plans to retire at the end of the season, proved there was still life in his injury-wracked body with a 6-3, 6-4 win over seventh seed Fernando Gonzalez.

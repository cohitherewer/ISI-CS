                                                     Viru absence huge: Kirsten
  - We certainly do not look at the the past but think ahead, says team India coach             Rahul Dravid during a practice session in Colombo on Wednesday. (Reuters)                           
	Chennai: Injured opener Virender Sehwag would be missed, coach Gary Kirsten conceded Wednesday but said the side has the depth to cope with the huge loss as they aim for the No. 1 team tag in the tri-series in Sri Lanka.         
	Obviously missing players like Sehwag is huge. He is a high quality player and any team would love to have him in their mix. We have got a lot of depth in our cricket at the moment, Kirsten said during a pre-departure press conference here.         
	New Zealand and Sri Lanka are the other teams in the tri-series.         
	The coach said the team can draw inspiration from their past record in Sri Lanka to make a clean-sweep, which would propel them to the top of the ICC one-day rankings.         
	We have done well in Sri Lanka in January this year. We won the series 4-1. We are familiar with the conditions there. But we know we are playing against two very good cricket teams, he said.         
	We have been performing well and we need to maintain our performance. We know that every day and against every team, we have got to be lot better and make sure that we are always on top, he said.         
	We go to Sri Lanka with confidence. We certainly do not look at the result of the past but think ahead, he said.         
	Asked who would be given the opening slot with Gautam Gambhir, Kirsten said that would be decided on the day of the match.         
	We are not sure as to what the combination is going to be in Sri Lanka. We will decide on the match day, he said.         
	The South African was excited about middle-order mainstay Rahul Dravids comeback and said the team would benefit from his vast experience. It is good to have him in the team. With that sort of experience, he is always going to help the team. It is wonderful to have him back in the squad, he said.         
	Kirsten said winning the toss would be crucial on Sri Lankan pitches which are known to be harsh on teams batting second. Winning the toss is quite important. But if you are going to be a world class team and a champion side at that, you need to win from any situation or condition. We are not going to look at that as an excuse, he said.         
	On whether the players would be rotated during the series, Kirsten said younger players are likely to get exposure.         
	We have tremendous depth in our team. Some of the younger players have proven their worth and are capable of cementing their places in the team. We will continue with that and wherever possible we need to give opportunity to them to play.         
	It is important to give them as much exposure as possible especially leading up to the World Cup. We will continue to do that but obviously the most important thing is that we need to win more games of cricket, Kirsten said.         
	The Indian team got a six-week break before this series. Kirsten said having the Corporate Trophy, where most of the top players competed, before the tri-series has ensured that the players wont turn up rusty in Sri Lanka.         
	Obviously, it was good to have had the Corporate Cup now. It is important to play some matches after a six-week break and it is important for the players to get strong again. We worked hard in the camp to make sure that the players are in good condition for another eight months.         
	I am very happy and excited about what I have seen of them. Corporate Cup was important for many players to get some game.         
	I think that the way the tournament is scheduled a few weeks before a very big tournament is good. Some players were a bit rusty but they had some games in the Corporate Cup, he said.         
	New Zealand is being seen as the weakest side in the tournament but Kirsten said the Black Caps are competitive with comeback-man Shane Bond being a huge factor.         
	It is a very good team. They have done well in one-day cricket. They have some powerful hitters in the bottom line and fairly stable. That is what you want in international cricket and New Zealand is a competitive team.         
	Bond is a great asset to the New Zealand team. He has not played cricket for a while but he is a great asset. Anyone, who bowls at that pace, can be a factor, Kitsten pointed out.         
	Kirsten gave a thumbs up to Sachin Tendulkars idea of splitting the one-dayers into four innings of 25 overs each to revive the format, saying the senior batsmans proposal should be given a thought.         
	It is a good idea. I know it has been suggested before somewhere down the line, Kirsten said.         
	Kirsten said the option can be explored.         
	I think what he is doing is that he is just opening it up to see the different options that could be brought about in the one-day game. A player of his stature, one should listen to him, he said.         
	On whether the team is feeling the pressure of expectations, Kirsten said the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led outfit can cope with it.         
	When you become one of the best teams in the world there is pressure involved and there is expectancy around that. If you are going to remain as the best and going to be there for a long time, you need to handle that expectancy well in that pressure. I think we are comfortable being in that position, he said.         
	Kirsten lauded the teams batting performance in the season so far and said the middle-order has become especially strong.         
	One exciting thing about the Indian team is that we have great batting line up. We have exceptionally talented players and some very experienced players as well. (PTI)

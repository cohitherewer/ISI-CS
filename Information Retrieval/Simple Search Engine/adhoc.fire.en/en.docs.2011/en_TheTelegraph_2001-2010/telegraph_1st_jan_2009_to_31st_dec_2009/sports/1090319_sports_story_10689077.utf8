The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We won 2 sessions out of 3: Ishant
                                                     We won 2 sessions out of 3: Ishant
            A CORRESPONDENT            New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori, who scored 118, in Hamilton on Wednesday. (AP)                           
	Hamilton: India pace bowler Ishant Sharma picked up four wickets against New Zealand on the first day but was disappointed that the hosts were let off the hook after being reduced to 61 for six at one stage here on Wednesday.         
	The lanky speedster said the wicket eased up after the lunch break when New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori (118) teamed up with Jesse Ryder (102) to forge a 186-run partnership for the seventh wicket.               
	The following are excerpts               
	How were the conditions for the fast bowlers         
	There was something in the wicket in the morning for the pacers. But after lunch, the wicket became flat. I think there was enough in the wicket. We had already decided to bowl first if we won the toss. With the wind there was some help, but against the wind, it was difficult for the fast bowlers. I think in the afternoon session, there was nothing for the fast bowlers. The ball was also not that new. It depends on how you bowl         
	If India should have restricted NZ to a lower total         
	Obviously, I think it would have been better for us to get them out below 200. But I think that is cricket. You learn every day. We are just learning, thats it.         
	On Indias overall performance on the first day         
	I think cricket is a funny game. Because we were on top in the first session, then we were down in the second. After that, we did really well, and Viru and Gautam batted well. You can say that we have won two sessions out of three. If we had bowled well in the middle session, it would have been better.         
	Was the ball not moving when Vettori and Ryder were batting?         
	I think when they were batting the ball was moving. We had a chance to get them out but we were sometimes unlucky. We got the edge but no fielder was there Sometimes they got beaten. I think its part and parcel of the game. You have to accept it We cant think too much about it.         
	What he felt was the recipe for Vettori and Ryders success         
	It depends how they go. They were not attacking too much. They were playing normally, on the merit of the ball. If you were bowling in the right areas, they defended. If you bowled a bad ball, they hit it for a boundary. So we cant help it.         
	On how the pitch will behave during the rest of the match         
	I think it depends. Maybe the ball was moving because it was the first day of the match, and there is always something in the wicket on the first day. But if the ball is moving, the bowlers have to bowl in the right areas.

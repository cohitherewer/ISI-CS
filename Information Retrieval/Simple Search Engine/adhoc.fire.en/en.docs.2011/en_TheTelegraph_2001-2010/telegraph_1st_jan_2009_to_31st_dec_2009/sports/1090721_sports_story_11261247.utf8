	Colombo: Sri Lanka hit back to take three wickets for two runs Monday as Pakistan reached 289 for seven at stumps on the first day of the third and final Test.         
	Khurram Manzoor and Mohammed Yousuf built a 167-run partnership for the third wicket to push Pakistan on from 36 for two after Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara won the toss and put Pakistan in to bat on a seaming Sinhalese Sports Club pitch.         
	Left-arm seamer Thilan Thushara dealt two quick blows in the morning session when opener Fawad Alam was caught behind by Tillekaratne Dilshan for 16 runs with the total on 34. Two runs later Pakistan captain Younis Khan dragged a ball on to his stumps for two.         
	Manzoor and Yousuf dominated the Sri Lanka attack for most of the first session and the entire middle session before Manzoor was out for 93, caught at slip by Mahela Jayawardene off seam bowler Chaminda Vaas.         
	He faced 197 balls and hit 10 fours before falling short of his maiden Test hundred.         
	Yousuf did not last long either and was run out for 90 though not before scoring his 7,000th Test run in his 82nd Test.         
	His bad call for a second run off an overthrow deprived him of his 25th Test hundred. His runs came off 146 balls and included seven fours and a six.         
	Misbah-ul Haq and Shoaib Malik held the innings together with a 75-run partnership before Thushara returned to trap Malik leg before for 45 with the total on 285.         
	His dismissal triggered a collapse as Misbah (27) and Umar Gul were out in quick succession to leave the visitors on 287 for seven.           (AP)

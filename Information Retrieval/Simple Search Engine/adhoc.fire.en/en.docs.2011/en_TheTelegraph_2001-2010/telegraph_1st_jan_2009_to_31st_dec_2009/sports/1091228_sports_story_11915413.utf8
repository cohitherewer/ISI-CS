	Calcutta: Teenager Rashid Khan overcame a slight stutter towards the end to win the LG Goodricke Eastern India Amateur Golf Championship, a triumph that marked his tenth win on the LG Amateur Tour.         
	Rashid defeated Rahul Bajaj with scores of 3 amp; 1 in the 36-hole final that was played at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club.         
	It feels really good to win my 10th title.         
	This win is close to my heart as I have never won a matchplay contest.         
	To win after coming through two qualifying rounds and five matches is quite special and I feel happy to finish the year in this fashion, the Delhi lad said after the victory.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Davids makes it easy for Cobras
                                                   Davids makes it easy for Cobras
                      
	Bangalore: Henry Davids cracked a breezy half-century as Cape Cobras registered an eight-wicket victory over Victoria Bushrangers, almost ensuring a semi-final berth in the Champions League Twenty20, here Saturday.         
	After a bomb scare delayed the start of the League B match by one hour and 40 minutes and reduced it to a 17-overs-a-side affair, pacer Monde Zondeki (2/21) inflicted early blows to restrict the Bushrangers to 125 for five.         
	The South African side, who carried forward two points from the group stage, then rode on an unbeaten 54-ball 69 by Davids to overhaul the target with one over to spare.         
	The 29-year-old handled the Bushrangers attack with elan on a pitch where the Australian side struggled to score. Davids struck seven fours and two sixes to take Cobras to 129, losing just two wickets.         
	Chasing the modest total, Cobras started on an attacking note with captain Andrew Puttick cracking a boundary off Shane Harwood off the first ball of the innings.         
	But pacer Peter Siddle removed Puttick immediately, when he mistimed a good length delivery and offered an easy catch to McDonald at mid-wicket. The other opener, Derek Brand, who scored 29 runs off just 15 balls with five boundaries in the first four overs, fell when Clint McKays direct throw found him short of the crease in the fifth over.         
	Davids then paired up with Duminy, who also remained unbeaten on 18, as the duo added 88 runs for the unseparated third wicket.

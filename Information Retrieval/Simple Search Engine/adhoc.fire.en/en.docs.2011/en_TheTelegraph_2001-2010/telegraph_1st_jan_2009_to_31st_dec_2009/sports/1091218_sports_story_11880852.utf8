The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gasquet cleared
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gasquet cleared
                      
	Berne: French tennis player Richard Gasquet, who tested positive for cocaine earlier this year, has been cleared of any doping offence by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).         
	The player has been exonerated from any fault or negligence and the CAS has dismissed the appeals filed by the ITF (International Tennis Federation) and WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency), CAS said in a statement.         
	CAS said it accepted Gasquets argument that the world No. 52 had been inadvertently contaminated after kissing a woman in a Miami nightclub on the day before the test.         
	The panel based its ruling on the evidence provided by the experts called by both the player and the ITF, who agreed that the amount of cocaine metabolite was so minute that it must have reflected incidental exposure, rather than use in the amounts commonly taken by social users of cocaine, said CAS.

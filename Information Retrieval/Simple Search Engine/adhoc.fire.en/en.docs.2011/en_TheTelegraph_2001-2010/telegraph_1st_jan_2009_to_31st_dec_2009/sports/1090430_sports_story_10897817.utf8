The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chargers look to continue run
                                                     Chargers look to continue run
                    Gilchrist                
	Pretoria: An all-conquering Deccan Chargers will look to extend their unbeaten spree while the Delhi DareDevils will hope to shrug off Tuesdays loss to the Rajasthan Royals when the two teams meet in their Indian Premier League match Thursday.         
	First seasons laggards, the Chargers have begun on an encouraging note in the second edition of the T20 league. They have won all their matches so far  against the Kolkata Knight Riders, the Royal Challengers Bangalore, the Mumbai Indians and the Chennai Super Kings  and are looking unstoppable.         
	South African Herschelle Gibbs and skipper Adam Gilchrist have been in ominous form. The duo have just blown opponents away with their powerful batting, something that has catapulted the duo among the top five run-getters in the tournament so far.         
	Their bowling has been equally good with R.P. Singh leading the pack with nine wickets while spinner Pragyan Ojha has also made opponents dance to his tune.         
	The DareDevils had a good opening to their campaign with three successive wins against the Kings XI Punjab, the Super Kings and the Royal Challengers from their first three matches.         
	However, their batting looked ordinary with the opening pair of Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag failing to make an impact. (PTI)

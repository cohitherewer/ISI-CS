	London: Teenager Dan Gosling scored deep in extra time to give Everton a 1-0 win over city rivals Liverpool in their FA Cup fourth-round replay on Wednesday.         
	The Merseyside neighbours, who had already shared two draws in just over a fortnight, were locked in another stalemate at 0-0 at the end of regulation time after a physical game that threw up few chances.         
	Playing with an extra man after Lucas Leivas dismissal for a second yellow card in the 76th minute, Everton were rewarded for their livelier play when Goslings shot went in off the post in the 118th minute.         
	Liverpools night was further ruined by an injury to their captain Steven Gerrard, who left the field after a quarter of an hour with a left hamstring problem. With Everton still playing without a recognised striker and Liverpool forward Fernando Torres looking out of sorts, goalkeepers Pepe Reina and Tim Howard had little to do for most of a scrappy match.         
	The best chance in normal time came midway through the second half when Everton midfielder Leon Osman thundered a shot off the right post.         
	Everton had several chances in extra time, Tim Cahill went just wide with a header and Osman forced a good save from Reina before 19-year-old midfielder Gosling stole the headlines and set up a fifth-round tie against Aston Villa.         
	In another all top-division encounter, Blackburn Rovers got the better of Sunderland with a 2-1 extra-time win.

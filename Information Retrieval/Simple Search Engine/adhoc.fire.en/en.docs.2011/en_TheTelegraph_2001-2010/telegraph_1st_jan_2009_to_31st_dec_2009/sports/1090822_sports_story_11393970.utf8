The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The little champion is the best among the greats
                                                     The little champion is the best among the greats
            [+uc('different strokes   sunil gavaskar   professional management group')+]                                    
	Tiger Woods, Roger Federer and Sachin Tendulkar are the three sportsmen in the world who stride their sport like a colossus having sent many a record tumbling and reset many benchmarks in their respective fields. They have dominated the sporting world and continue to be the cynosure of all eyes whenever they play and wherever they go.         
	They have had challengers to their throne and there are some truly outstanding players in sport today, many of whom have taken up their sport, thanks to the inspirational deeds of these players.         
	Federer recently went past Pete Samprass record of winning the most majors in tennis and Sachin Tendulkar virtually owns all batting records in the game, apart from the highest individual innings in Test and one-day cricket.         
	Tiger Woods is just four wins away from joining Jack Nicklaus as the winner of most majors in golf.         
	Last week, Woods came within inches of winning his 15th major. He was leading after each of the first three days of the tournament, and when Tiger goes leading into the last day, he wins. At least he did till last week. He had a most horrendous last round by his standards and that allowed a less known Korean, Y.E. Yang, to win the championship, depriving Tiger of his 15th major.         
	So badly did Tiger play on the last day, and so exasperated he was with his own golf, he ended up using the F word and shocked not just those following him on the golf course but all those TV viewers who were avidly waiting for him to win his first major of the year.         
	Tiger had missed the most of last year with a knee injury that was thought, at one stage, to be serious enough to keep him out of the game for a long time. Some of his contemporaries might have nursed hopes that it would be a permanent damage but that was not to be.         
	He worked hard and came back and was thus desperate to make up for lost time. He went out of the British Open tamely and so, in the last major of the year, he was understandably keen to win so that he would not have a majorless year.         
	He has been winning other tournaments. So it is not as if he has been playing badly, and God knows, the way he played on the first three days of the US PGA, it looked as if the trophy was signed, sealed and delivered to him. His loss was almost like Tendulkar getting out in the 90s, which is very rare indeed.         
	Unfortunately, thats exactly what happened. Woods simply lost the plot and though he ended up as the runner-up, that is not what he was aiming for. Great players are not happy with just performing, they want to end up winning.         
	So the frustrations of that days play boiled over and the F word appeared at the 17th hole where he had a chance to put pressure on Yang.         
	However, those who have been following the majors this year will have noticed that whenever Tiger has hit a bad shot, he may not have used an expletive but he has chucked his club away or tossed it over his head in anger and frustration.         
	Roger Federer, who is also uber cool when he is playing, and even more with his looks, was pictured smashing his racquet in an ATP tournament earlier in the year. He had cried after losing narrowly to Nadal in the Australian Open, and after that, he was getting beaten by players who would have never dreamt of taking a set off him even a year back.         
	Federer was also looking to win the French Open and another major to go past Sampras, and suddenly he was losing to some unknown players. Thus the pressure started to build up and when he could not cope with it, the racquet got smashed. Of course, now with the elusive French open in his bag and also the most majors in the tennis world, as well as fatherhood, he will be back to being the super cool guy the world of tennis loves.         
	That brings us to Tendulkar. Like Woods and Federer, he has also set standards that are hard to match. As Woods and Federer are expected to win every tournament they play in, the little champion is expected to score a century and more in every innings. The difference is in the numbers of those expectations.         
	While both Woods and Federer have millions of fans all over the world, it is in no way comparable to the millions in India alone, who worship the ground Tendulkar walks on, and believe that their man can do no wrong.         
	Unlike Woods and Federer, whose houses and cars are safe even if they lose in the first round, Indian cricketers have found homes and properties destroyed by angrys crowd after not performing up to the expectations.         
	It is under this pressure of expectation that Indian cricketers have to play and Tendulkar has more of this pressure than anyone else. Yet, tell me if in all these years of playing for India, there has been even one instance of Tendulkar losing his cool and swearing or behaving in a manner that has further aggravated the situation.         
	There may have been the odd grimace when he has got a bad decision, but nothing beyond that. His demeanour on the field and off it has been impeccable and exemplary and this, despite the expectations of many more followers than Woods and Federer.         
	It is not easy, and I speak from some experience. Thats why in this era of Woods, Federer and Tendulkar, the little champion is the best of them all.

	 Asian under-12 boys champion Diptayan Ghosh stole the show in the fourth and fifth rounds of the National Challenger Chess Championship at Town Hall on Monday. Diptayan upset third seed, M.S. Thejkumar in the fourth round and went on to draw with Swapnil Dhopade in the fifth. Diptayan now has five points.       
	Thejkumar, playing black, opted for the Caro-Kann defence but he weakened his kingside in the middlegame. Diptayan neatly exploited the weaknesses in his opponents position with his better bishop and two rooks to force a mating net around his opponents king. P.D.S. Girinath of Railways emerged as the sole leader with five points after five rounds. Sayantan Das of Bengal beat higher rated K. Priyadarshan to take his tally to four points.

	Karachi: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has pressed the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to outline its position on the Mohammed Asif drugs case.         
	The fast bowler was detained at Dubai airport last June after being found in possession of opium. A senior Pakistani official said the board had received an e-mail from the ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat inquiring about the boards stance on the case which has drawn calls for a life ban.         
	We have got an e-mail. They have seen documents from Dubai authorities related to the case, Saleem Altaf, the PCBs chief operating officer, said on Thursday. (REUTERS)

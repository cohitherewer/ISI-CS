  - Shashank Manohar, Ejaz Butt to be present in Mohali tomorrow       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, Shashank Manohar, and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ejaz Butt will both be in Mohali, on Monday, but no formal talks are on the cards.         
	Both, indeed, are coming... However, there are no plans for a formal meeting between the two... Having said that, nothing stops them from informally interacting with each other, host Inderjit Singh Bindra told The Telegraph.         
	A former BCCI president, Bindra heads the Punjab Cricket Association, which is staging the fourth India-Australia ODI that day. Hes also the International Cricket Councils principal advisor.         
	It wont, actually, surprise if Bindra himself takes the initiative to set up an informal session(s) between Manohar and Butt.         
	Relations between the BCCI and the PCB have been strained ever since Team Indias tour to Pakistan (in January-February this year) got cancelled and, later, the PCB lost the right to host its share of the 2011 World Cup matches.         
	The shifting of the 2011 World Cup secretariat from Lahore to Mumbai, at the BCCIs behest, had caused much heartburn as well.         
	For now, the PCB is very keen to play India on neutral territory (the UAE and/or the UK), but New Delhi is unlikely to give its okay till relations with Islamabad improve considerably.         
	Whatever the level of interaction between Manohar and Butt, a breakthrough isnt expected in Mohali. The ill will at the level of the Boards, though, could become a thing of the past.         
	Or, at least, get lessened.         
	Thats definitely possible. After all, at different times, the BCCI and the PCB have shared an excellent relationship. Being on the same wavelength, for example, went a long way in the successful staging of the 1987 and the 1996 World Cups.

                                                                                                                       7                                        Chidi Bagans saviour, again
            A STAFF REPORTER            Edeh Chidi on Friday.   A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Star Mohun Bagan striker Edeh Chidi had said after their last CFL Premier Division match, against George Telegraph, that he wanted a bit of rest before the upcoming Federation Cup.         
	On Friday, during Bagans 1-0 win over Mohammedan AC, it was proved how important the Nigerian sharpshooter is for the green and maroon brigade.         
	It was Chidis 87th minute strike that bailed Karim Bencherifas side out of trouble when Mohammedan AC was almost set to snatch a point from them.         
	It was Bagans sixth win in as many matches and, with 18 points, they continue to lead the league table.         
	Substitute Snehashis Chakraborty sprinted down the left and sent a measured cross for Japanese Ryuji Sueoka. Ryujis tap was intercepted by opposition custodian Raju Ekka but the ball bounced off his chest and Chidi banged home the rebound. The Mohammedan AC players, however, alleged that Ryuji, while tapping the ball, had hit Ekka.         
	The furious Mohammedan AC coach, Pranab Chakraborty, said that they will lodge a written complaint with the Indian Football Association regarding the quality of supervision by referee Biplab Poddar.         
	The main problem with Bagan on the day was the rusty show by their two wingers  Ishfaq Ahmed and Tomba Singh.

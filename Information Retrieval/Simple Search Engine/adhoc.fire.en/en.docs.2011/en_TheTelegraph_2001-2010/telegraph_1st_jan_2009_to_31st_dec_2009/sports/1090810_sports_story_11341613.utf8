                                                   Main aim is to win title: Lee
                      
	Hyderabad: He tops the rankings but a World Championship title still eludes Malaysian shuttler Lee Chong Wei, who is hoping to break the jinx this time by not letting the pressure bog him down.         
	The top seed said not winning the World Championship till now still hurts him. It would be the main target this year but I dont want to think about that and put pressure on myself, Lee said when asked if missing the World Championship still hurts.         
	I am just concentrating on myself. My game has been good so far, the form is also fine now, said the Beijing Olympics silver medallist.         
	Lee, who won the Malaysian Super Series and Indonesian Super Series titles recently, said he doesnt want to look too far and take the tournament round by round.         
	I can try my best. I am only focussing on one round at a time and am not thinking about quarter final and semi-final. I am focused on the first round and if I can cross the first hurdle, I will look at the second round, he said.         
	Asked about his fierce rivalry with World No. 5 Chinese Lin Dan, Lee said although he is mentally prepared he hasnt thought about facing him in the event.         
	We have played in the Swiss open and Sudirman Cup and it is like 50-50. I am mentally prepared about meeting him, he said.         
	Asked about the Indian players, Lee said, They are good. There is Saina (Nehwal), who recently won the Indonesian Open, There is Anup (Sridhar), Chetan (Anand) and Arvind Bhat. All of them are very good players. (PTI)

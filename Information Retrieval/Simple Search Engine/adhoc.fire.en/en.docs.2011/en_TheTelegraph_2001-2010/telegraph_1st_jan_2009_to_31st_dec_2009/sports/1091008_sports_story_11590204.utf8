The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Marykom ban is revoked
                                                     Marykom ban is revoked
            OUR CORRESPONDENT             Marykom                           
	Jamshedpur: The Indian Boxing Federation (IBF) revoked the suspension slapped on MC Marykom on Wednesday.         
	The ban was lifted after the four-time world champion tendered an apology to the jury and the IBF executive council.         
	Marykoms reprieve means she will now be able to accompany the Indian team for the Indoor Asian Games to be held in Hanoi later this month.         
	Confirming the development, IBF secretary general Col PK Muralidharan Raja said Marykom gave her version of the unsavoury incident which took place on Monday after she lost her 46 kg quarter-final bout to Pinki Jangwar of Haryana.         
	Raja said that something prompted the ace pugilist to lose her composure. Marykom told us that she had gracefully accepted defeat.         
	Things were okay when she was leaving the ring. But all went wrong when she alighted from the ring, leading her to have a go at the judges, he added.         
	Marykom also promised not to make any derogatory statements in future.         
	Having considered her past performances, both at the national and international levels, we have decided to revoke the temporary suspension.         
	Marykom is a world champion and senior boxer and the IBF decision to punish her was to set an example before others, Raja said.         
	He also expressed confidence that Marykom, being an ambassador of women boxing, would set examples in the sport arena to promote the game.         
	Raja also addressed the participating boxers explaining them the essentials of good behaviour.         
	With the ban revoked, Marykom can now be part of the six-member India squad for the upcoming Indoor Asian Games to be held at Hanoi in Vietnam later this month.         
	Marykom lost her bout against Pinky on count back and the five-member jury had to step in with their judgement after they were locked in a 15-15 stalemate.         
	My defeat was planned. It was a conspiracy by Thakaran and countrys chief boxing coach Anoop Kumar. The Haryana lobby in the IBF is responsible for the whole mess (involving boxers from the Northeast).         
	Indian boxing will head nowhere if such activities are allowed to continue, an Marykom had alleged on Tuesday.         
	On Thursday though she had a change of heart and as they say alls well that ends well.

                                                   Md. Sporting in need of victory
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sportings fight for survival in the I-League will continue when they face JCT in the 14th round at the Salt Lake Stadium Saturday. While JCT managed a draw in their last match, against bottom-placed Vasco Sports Club, the black-and-white brigade lost to league leaders Sporting Clube de Goa.         
	Injuries to key players like Mike Okoro and Theodore Sunday have put the city club in a spot since the start of the I-League. They recently had to release Sunday and the team is yet to gain a foothold in the top level of Indian football.         
	Coach Shabbir Ali had done well to get the club promoted to the top tier but the footballers have done nothing this season to suggest they belong to this level.

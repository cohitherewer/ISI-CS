The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kalighat not to play today
                                                   Kalighat not to play today
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The JC Mukherjee Trophy final ran into trouble with defending champions Kalighat standing firm on their decision not to take part in the final of the twenty20 tournament if it was held on Tuesday.         
	Kalighat had submitted a letter to the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) last Saturday requesting them to defer the final of the tournament, in case they made it to the title clash.         
	The club said they would be unable to play continuously for four days with a two-day league match on Saturday and Sunday and the JC Mukherjee Trophy semi-final on Monday.         
	The CAB tournament committee overruled Kalighats appeal maintaining that the final would be held as scheduled on Tuesday at the Jadavpur University grounds, Salt Lake, from 1 pm. But Kalighat stayed put on their decision of not playing the final.         
	We had conveyed our stand before the semis. Were not playing tomorrow. We never asked for an indefinite postponement The club has taken a stand after giving a lot of thought to it, club secretary Bablu Kolay said.         
	Asked if it was difficult to forfeit the final for the defending champions, Kolay said: Its unfortunate. But we believe we needed to make a statement.         
	CAB tournament committee chairman Prabir Chakraborty said that the fixtures were sent to the clubs on January 13 and the committee decided it was not possible to change the schedule at the last hour.         
	Weve decided to keep the match on. There were no objections when we sent the schedule to them on January 13, Chakraborty said.         
	Mohun Bagan, the other JC Mukherjee Trophy finalists, said they were ready for the final. They threatened to boycott all CAB tournaments if the association deferred the final to a later date.         
	The recent controversy surrounding the fixtures does not bode well for the CAB, who also faced a similar situation regarding the registration of the foreign players, a few days back.         
	If Kalighat dont turn up for the final, it will be an embarrassing situation for the CAB in the presence of Chaminda Vaas.         
	He helped Bagan reach the final with his all-round show.         
	SUMMARISED SCORES

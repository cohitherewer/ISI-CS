	Madrid: Barcelona capped their best ever season with a 1-1 draw at Deportivo La Coruna while Atletico Madrid beat Almeria 3-0 to clinch the Spanish leagues final Champions League place on Saturday.         
	Three days after beating Manchester United in the Champions League final to complete a historic treble, Spanish champion Barcelona, playing only a handful of regular starters, rallied from Rodolfo Bodipos first-half header when Samuel Eto equalised from a clear chance in the 89th minute for his 30th league goal.         
	Barcelona won the league with a record 87 points in 38 games and scored 105 goals  two short of matching Real Madrids record during the 1989-90 season.         
	Madrid was second with 76 points and Sevilla third with 67  the same total as Atletico. Madrid and Sevilla play on Sunday.         
	Diego Forlan practically clinched the Pichichi trophy  given to the leagues top scorer  with his 32nd goal for Atletico, which will play in Europes top-tier competition in two consecutive seasons for the first time.         
	Sergio Agueros highlight reel goal gave Atletico a 19th-minute lead, Raul Garcia doubled it in the 27th and Forlan sealed it with a long-range effort in the 50th.         
	Villarreal will play in next seasons Europa League  formerly the Uefa Cup  after beating Mallorca 3-2 to finish fifth with 65 points. Valencia will also play in the competition after David Villas double secured a 2-0 win over Athletic Bilbao that left them sixth with 62 points. Villa finished with 28 goals.         
	Athletic will also feature in Europes second-tier competition since they reached the Copa del Rey final, where it lost 4-1 to Barcelona.         
	Barcelona played without most of its stars, as Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta, and Thierry Henry were all rested following the 2-0 triumph at Romes Stadio Olimpico.         
	It wasnt a straightforward game for us; wed played on Wednesday and with all the matches that we had in these past months, it wasnt easy for us to get into the game, said assistant coach Tito Vilanova, who replaced suspended coach Pep Guardiola. But we held our head high all the way through.         
	Since clinching the league title, Barcelona hasnt won, having lost twice and drawn once. Eto  who scored against United  was given a start since he was chasing Forlans goal tally. Eto chested Bojan Krkics lob pass inside the area before finishing off with a right-footed volley.

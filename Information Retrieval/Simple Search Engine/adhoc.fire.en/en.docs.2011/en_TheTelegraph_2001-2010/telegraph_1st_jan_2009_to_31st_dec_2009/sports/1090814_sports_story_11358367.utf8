                                                   World meet no longer same: Taufik 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hyderabad: The name Taufik Hidayat summons up visions of one of the best shuttlers in modern times. An Olympic and world champion, he has won almost every title a player looks to pocket.         
	He has seduced spectators with his tricky net play and deceptive drop shots and enjoys a big fan following in his native Indonesia.         
	Playing in India only for the second time after winning the India Open title earlier this year, Taufik said: I enjoy playing here as the crowd knows me and supports me. It feels great when you know the crowd is supporting you.         
	The fourth seed, who celebrated his 28th birthday on the inaugural day of the World Badminton Championships, said he feels right at home and confident about his chances.         
	Im happy with my current form. Although the first round was easy, the second was not so, Taufik said.         
	About the draw, the soft-spoken Indonesian claimed: It was a surprise, but hey, its a game. These things happen.         
	The Athens Games gold medallist has a complaint though. The World Championships has lost its sheen.         
	It may be mentioned that the World Championships were held every three years until 1983, and then became a biennial event from 1985. The format was changed again in 2005 when it became an annual tournament.         
	Its not like the Olympics for which one has to wait four years. In this event, even if you dont make it one year, you know that you can work for the next year and win the title. There are no long working sessions and neither the prestige the World Championships earlier enjoyed, said Taufik.

                                                   Learnt a great deal from him: Strauss
                      
	London: England captain Andrew Strauss heaped praise on Michael Vaughan saying his predecessors ability to outwit opponents set him apart from the crowd.         
	I count Michael as a good friend as well as a teammate and I know what a tough decision this will have been for him as he took so much pleasure and pride in representing his country, said Strauss.         
	I learned a great deal from watching him captain the side for five years at close hand. He had this ability to identify a new strategy for outwitting the opposition or bring the best out of his own players, said the 32-year-old about Englands most successful captain.         
	The England captain admitted that Vaughans presence would be missed in the dressing room. But more than anything, we as players will miss the enormous sense of fun and enjoyment that Michael brought to the dressing room. He will be missed by everyone connected with the team and we wish him every success in his future career.         
	Strauss teammate Andrew Flintoff lauded Vaughan as someone born to be England captain.         
	Playing under Vaughanie, I probably had the best moments of my career so far, Flintoff said on Monday.         
	Flintoff added composure was key to the Yorkshire batsmans captaincy. As a captain he was unflappable. He stood at mid-off and whether the opposition were 500 for none or 90 for nine, there could be mayhem ensuing around him but Vaughanie would just be there as always. I think that rubbed off on the rest of the team and we played our best cricket under him.         
	Kevin Pietersen, recalling one of his earliest England appearances in 2004 when he found himself facing a hostile crowd in Johannesburg during a one-day international against his native South Africa, said Vaughan had given him valuable advice.         
	Michael Vaughan was huge to me. I remember one of the first things he said to me, coming in at the Wanderers to play South Africa in that huge series when 60,000 people were looking as if they were going to kill me, Pietersen said.         
	He walked up to me in the middle of the wicket and said The ball is white the ball is round, you know what youve done to get here, just watch it as hard as you can.         
	That calmed me right down, from being a gibbering wreck walking on to that field to the player that I am now because thats all I do now, watch the ball.         
	the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chairman Giles Clarke said: Everyone associated with cricket in England and Wales will be forever grateful to Michael Vaughan for his immense contribution to the England teams success, said in a statement.         
	ECB managing director Hugh Morris ranked Vaughan among the best captains in the world. As an international captain Michael ranks among the very best and the way in which he and Duncan Fletcher forged a team capable of winning six consecutive Test series stands as testament to his ability to inspire and motivate those around him.         
	Australia vice-captain Michael Clarke said Vaughan was as admired by his opponents as he was by his teammates.           (AGENCIES)

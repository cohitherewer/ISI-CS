                                                   Colts need to adapt quickly
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: From the searing 43 degrees of Mumbai to Hobarts wintry 15 is some change in conditions, but if you are a globe-trotting international sportsperson, you would be used to it.         
	The India under-19 cricket team will be initiated into getting used to the many hazards of top-level sport when they play Australia in three one-dayers and two three-day matches between April 7 and 21.         
	The 16-member squads nine-day camp here included physical training, nets and practice matches in energy-sapping conditions. Hobart, however, would welcome them with a milder sun and night temperatures of 10 degrees. It is sure to be a balm to the players.         
	With none of the youngsters having been part of the Indian team before, coach Chandrakant Pandit had the major task of generating team spirit during the camp. I have told them one thing. The key is to enjoy each and everybodys performance and everybody is going to get an opportunity, Pandit said.

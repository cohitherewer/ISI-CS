The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB may rest senior players
                                                   PCB may rest senior players
                      
	Karachi: Feeling let down by the senior players in the Champions Trophy, Pakistani selectors are contemplating resting some of them and drafting in new faces in the forthcoming one-day International series against New Zealand in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.         
	Chief selector Iqbal Qasim said the selectors would be sitting down to finalise the team for the ODI series after the second round matches of the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy are completed.         
	That is why we have asked all the senior players to play in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, it is mandatory, Qasim, a former Test spinner, said.         
	Pressure has mounted on the board and selectors to look at fresh blood after the inconsistent form of senior players including Imran Nazir, Misbah-ul Haq and Umar Gul.         
	The success of youngsters Umar Akmal and Mohammed Aamer has bolstered the argument that Pakistan cricket is in dire need of fresh blood.           (PTI)

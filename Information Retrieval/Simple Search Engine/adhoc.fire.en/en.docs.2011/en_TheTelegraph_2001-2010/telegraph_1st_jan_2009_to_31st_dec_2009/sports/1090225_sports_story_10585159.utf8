The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Weather, not NZ, is Indias worry
                                                   Weather, not NZ, is Indias worry
                      
	Christchurch: World champions India will worry more about the fickle New Zealand weather than the composition and strength of Daniel Vettoris team when they meet the hosts in the first Twenty20 International at the AMI Park here on Wednesday.         
	The advent of autumn has seen the temperatures drop and there has been sporadic rain, which have offset Indias preparation for the match.         
	More than the Black Caps resilience and home advantage, it will be the weather factor which could ruffle Mahendra Singh Dhonis all-conquering legion.         
	Given their streak of success in this format and the plethora of talent they have in their ranks, India start as hot favourites in the two-match Twenty20 series.         
	While New Zealand have two potential match-winners in Brendon McCullum and Jacob Oram, who was specifically included in the squad to provide thrust to the not-so-powerful batting, India have an array of explosive batsmen who can turn the match on its head.         
	India have two explosive openers in Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir, who will be backed by the king of Twenty20, Yuvraj Singh, who continues to flog the bowlers across the parks as if he were batting in the backyard of his Chandigarh home.         
	Both captain Dhoni and Yusuf Pathan are capable of clearing the grounds in New Zealand with utmost ease. Be it seam or spin, they are equally capable of producing boundaries at will.         
	If the Black Caps feel that the bounce in the wicket could give them the edge in the bowling aspect, they would have to deal with the pace duo of Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma  widely regarded as the best fast bowling pair in the world at the moment.         
	Indias Twenty20 record is encouraging. They have lost only two of 11 matches they have played so far, losing to New Zealand in the World Cup in Johannesburg and Australia in Melbourne.         
	But India would not surely underestimate the inexperienced New Zealand outfit, which had given a good account of itself in the just-concluded series against Australia. The Black Caps drew the ODI series 2-2 and lost the Twenty International by one run.         
	Teams         
	India (likely): Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Yuvraj Singh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (capt.), Ravindra Jadeja, Yusuf Pathan, Irfan Pathan, Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma.         
	New Zealand (likely): Brendon McCullum, Martin Guptill, Jesse Ryder, Ross Taylor/Neil Broom, Grant Elliott, Jacob Oram, Nathan McCullum, Daniel Vettori, Ian Butler, Tim Southee, Iain Brien.         
	Match starts: 11.30 am (IST)           (AGENCIES)

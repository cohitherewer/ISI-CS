The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chopra, Bangar packed off
                                                   Chopra, Bangar packed off
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Port Elizabeth: Aakash Chopra and Sanjay Bangar, both ill-suited for the T20 game, have been packed off by the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	Theyve been released and the strength of our squad is now 20, team director Joy Bhattacharjya told The Telegraph.         
	Chopra played the first two matches, while Bangar had replaced him in the third. Not a ball was bowled on Saturday, in the fourth match, but neither wouldve made the XI.         
	While Chopra had been with the Knights last year too, Bangar (discarded by the Deccan Chargers) came on board last month.         
	Meanwhile, as had been decided before the IPLs second edition got under way, four members of the support staff said goodbye to the Brendon McCullums in Cape Town.         
	Going their different ways now are assistant coach Joydeep Mukherjee, fielding and throwing coach Jon Deeble, second fielding coach Wade Seecombe and drills specialist Brad Murphy.

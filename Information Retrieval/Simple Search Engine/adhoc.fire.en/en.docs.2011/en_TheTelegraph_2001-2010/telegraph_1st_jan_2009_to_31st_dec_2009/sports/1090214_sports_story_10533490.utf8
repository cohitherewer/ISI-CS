                                                   Battle at hand for United SC
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: When United SC and Air India cross swords in a 15th round I-League match at the flood-lit Salt Lake Stadium Saturday, it will be a clash of two teams with identical styles  an ultra-defensive and dogged approach which sometimes stifles their opponents, giving them precious points.         
	The league table, though, says that their style is not paying off at the moment. Relegated to the basement, United, with 13 points from 14 matches, have a mountain to climb if they wish to beat the drop.         
	Air India are hovering mid-table but consecutive losses against Mohun Bagan and East Bengal have somewhat derailed their campaign.         
	So, in the present situation both will have to do away with their tried and tested style and go into attack mode. United coach Subrata Bhattacharya said that in a perfect situation he would have liked to do that but, stung by injures, he will adopt the usual safety-first approach.         
	Gauranga Datta, Snehasish Chakraborty and Dhanarajan are all in the injury ward, while Arnab Mondal and Gautam Debnath will miss the match due to double bookings. We have a battle at hand, Bhattacharya said after the morning practice session.         
	Air India would like to capitalise on Uniteds precarious situation, even though striker Samson Singh and regular goalkeeper Arup Debnath will be missing the action.         
	Uttam Singh is likely to return, while coach Bimal Ghosh is mulling leaving one of the three foreigners out.         
	Michael Tayo is sure to start but I havent decided who to drop between the other two, Ghosh informed.

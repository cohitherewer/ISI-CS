The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hungry Dilshan feasts on insipid bowling
                                                                                                                                   Hungry Dilshan feasts on insipid bowling
  - Sri Lanka make strong start after dismissing India for 426       INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                            
	Ahmedabad: India made up for some pretty ordinary bowling with two wickets in the final session on Tuesday, but that wasnt enough to peg back Sri Lanka at close on the second day of the opening Test.         
	Tillekaratne Dilshans solid 112, and an unbroken 81-run partnership for the fourth wicket between Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera placed the visitors on a strong 275 for three after India had finished on 426 in the morning.         
	On a wicket that offered very little help to the bowlers, the batsmen made merry once the early freshness evaporated, at the Sardar Patel Stadium in nearby Motera. The Indians will be hoping to capitalise on the conditions Wednesday morning, and that could decide the outcome of this Test.         
	Except for comeback man Zaheer Khan, the bowling lacked discipline and penetration. Ishant Sharma looked good only in his second spell when he forced Tharanga Paranavitana to nick one to Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who dived in front of first slip to take a superb one-handed catch.         
	The spin duo of Harbhajan Singh and Amit Mishra were the most disappointing. The off-spinner refused to flight the ball and lacked variation, while Mishra showed all the signs of lack of match practice. More importantly, both spinners seemed to crumble whenever the visitors launched into an offensive.         
	However hard Gary Kirsten might try to defend his bowlers and the team combination, the fact remains that India missed a fifth specialist bowler on this wicket.         
	Dilshan exposed the limitations of the attack with intelligent batting during his 205-minute vigil at the wicket. This was his fifth century in 2009, and tenth overall.         
	Dilshans success has been a revelation this year. He started off with centuries in both innings against Bangladesh in Chittagong in January, and has not looked back. The success earned him a promotion as an opener, albeit in the shorter version.         
	The Indian Premier League in South Africa  418 runs in 14 matches at an average of 41.80 for Delhi the DareDevils  only lent credence to his capabilities. The ICC World Twenty20 also proved to be an instant hit, and he opened for the first time in Tests against New Zealand in August.         
	Tuesday was not about his slam-bang approach. He timed the ball to perfection, placing it in the gaps and running hard for the singles when the boundaries dried up. There were only 12 boundaries during his 133-ball stay. None of the bowlers could disturb his concentration, not even after taking a Zaheer bouncer on his shoulder.         
	Dilshan mixed caution with aggression and never let the run-rate drop to below four an over. Paranavitana got a major share of the strike during the 74-run opening stand as Zaheer and Ishant failed to exploit his weaknesses. While Zaheer bowled too short, Ishant was guilty of spraying it all over.         
	Zaheers penchant to dig it in, though, came in handy. Dilshan tried to pull, but was cramped by the angle from round the stumps as Dravid held on to the top edge. An over later, Sangakkara (31) threw caution to the wind and hooked into the hands of deep fine leg.         
	Two wickets in a span of five runs, and the stage was set for Harbhajan and Mishra to find the inroads, but despite getting some turn in the last hour, they disappointed.         
	Mahela (36 batting) and Samaraweera (45 batting) looked good during their 93-minute association, and India need to get rid of them quickly on Wednesday.         
	The first session is proving to be crucial and some smart bowling by the Lankans once again did the Indians on Tuesday. Once Rahul Dravid fell without any addition to his overnight 177, the Indians could manage only a further 41 runs. Dravid became Chanaka Welegedaras fourth victim, the slight movement enough to carry the inside edge onto the stumps. Harbhajan and Zaheer carried on for a while with a flurry of boundaries.         
	The frustration grew among the pacers and Damika Prasad even directed a beamer at Zaheer, with the batsman almost falling over the stumps in an attempt to get away from the line. Prasad immediately apologised to Zaheer.         
	Once Sangakkara brought spin from both ends, the runs dried up. Rangana Heraths arm ball dismissed Zaheer, although replays showed that it might just have brushed the leg stump while Harbhajans ambitious attempt to reverse sweep Muttiah Muralidharan against the turn for the second time in an over proved fatal. Ishant lasted just four balls.         
	A few more runs could have come in handy under the circumstances.

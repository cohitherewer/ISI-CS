	Zurich: Lionel Messi, the Barcelona forward, has been named Fifa World Player of the Year, as briefly reported in Tuesdays Late City edition.         
	The Argentine won the prestigious award in Zurich after the 22 year-old won the vote ahead of Bara team-mates Andres Iniesta, Xavi and Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka of Real Madrid.         
	Messi capped a fantastic year in which he has won an unprecedented haul of six successive trophies  La Liga, European Cup, Copa del Rey, Super Cup and Spanish Super Cup and Club World Cup.         
	After receiving the award from Michel Platini, Uefa president and former France international, he said: This completes a magnificent year for Barcelona, my team-mates and for me. Im extremely happy. Weve just ended a historic year, a perfect year in which weve won every competition weve played in.         
	We just needed to take this last step and everything has worked out how we wanted. Its amazing.         
	Ronaldo won the Fifa Puskas award for the best goal of the 2008-09 season  his Manchester United goal against Porto in the Champions League in April.         
	Brazilian player Marta won the Fifa womens player of the year award for the fourth year in a row.         
	The Argentine, who joined Barcelona as a 13-year-old in 2000, claimed 1,073 points in a poll of 147 national team coaches and captains.         
	Ronaldo, last years winner, was a distant second with 352 points followed by Spain and Barcelona midfielder Xavi (196).         
	Messi was leading scorer in the 2008-09 Champions League, hitting nine goals including one in the 2-0 final win over Manchester United.         
	He also notched the extra-time winner in the 2-1 Club World Cup final victory over Estudiantes in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.         
	Messis vote appeared to be entirely based on his club form as his performances for Argentina, under coach Diego Maradona, were largely disappointing.

                                                     Bagan pray for Churchill slip
  - I dont want another so-near-yet-so-far story, says coach Bencharifa       A STAFF REPORTER            Scorers Barreto and N.S. Manju after Mohun Bagans win on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Shabbir Ali was waiting on the sidelines as a beaming Karim Bencharifa wrapped up a post-match interview to a television channel after Mohun Bagans dramatic 2-1 win over Dempo Sports Club on Sunday. As the interview came to an end, and Bencharifa started walking towards the tunnel of the Barasat Stadium, the Mohammedan Sporting coach came and shook hands. Bencharifa smiled and said: All the best against Churchill.         
	Yes! Mohun Bagan need their city rivals to rise above the script and upset the Churchill applecart in Goa if N.S. Manjus injury-time winner against Dempo is to count.         
	Now, tied for points with Churchill (43 from 21 matches), Mohun Bagan need to beat Mahindra in the capital on Thursday and hope Mohammedan Sporting at least manage a draw. If both Churchill and Bagan win their matches, the Goans will have their maiden I-League title by virtue of better goal difference.         
	A draw though wont help Shabbirs cause. He needs three points and will be hoping that Mumbai FC beat JCT in Gurgaon to stave off relegation. In that case JCT will find themselves in second division for the first time in the history of the national league.         
	Going by present form its unlikely that Mohammedan Sporting will do a Houdini in Goa but, as Sundays match once again proved, in football you cannot take anything for granted.                       
	At the post-match conference, Bencharifa said his side still have a chance. But if the refereeing continues to be like what it was on Sunday I am sceptical. Referee Rizwan-ul- Haque flashed eight yellow cards  five to Mohun Bagan  and the Bagan coach launched a scathing attack on the standard of refereeing.         
	He has every right to complain as he will be missing Marcos Pereira, N.S. Manju, Rakesh Masih and Lalkamal Bhowmick for the Mahindra match. Bencharifa was candid enough to say: Wish me luck.         
	Dempos Armando Colaco said that at this moment Churchill are favourites to win the title. They are in top form and will be playing at home. And the way Mohammedan Sporting capitulated against us in Goa, I dont think they have a chance. Churchill are sending buses to Mumbai to bring in the fans. Mohammedan Sporting face an uphill task in Goa. Take it from me.         
	Bencharifa also urged his fans to travel to New Delhi. Come to Delhi and root for us. This crowd was just fantastic today. The way they egged us on till the final minutes was just fantastic. We will miss them really miss them, the Moroccan was getting carried away.         
	If things dont go Bagans way on Thursday, then Bencharifa will be second time unlucky. Last year when he was at the helm at Churchill, Dempo pipped them at the post. I dont want another so-near-yet-so-far story, he said smilingly.         
	Deep down he knows it may happen. But still, he and his team deserve all the credit for taking this I-League to the wire. Calcutta League, Federation Cup and runners-up in the I-League in his very first year will not be something he wont boast of in future.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC snub will motivate SA: Arthur
                                                   ICC snub will motivate SA: Arthur
                      
	Johannesburg: South Africa coach Mickey Arthur is disappointed that the ICC did not consider any of the Proteas good enough to be nominated for its annual awards and said the snub will spur the boys in their quest for the ICC Champions Trophy.         
	The absence of any South African name was very disappointing, especially when you take into account how well the team has performed in the past year, Arthur was quoted as saying.         
	We have not yet had the time to discuss it within the team, but I am certain that it will just motivate the boys to do well in the tournament.         
	Arthur said the team would now concentrate all its energy on the opening game of the Champions Trophy against Sri Lanka at SuperSport Park in Centurion next Tuesday.         
	That game is the first hurdle we have to cross and we are not thinking further than that.         
	The coach said he hoped that a good performance against the West Indies in a practice match in Potchefstroom on Friday would help build the South Africans confidence for the opener.           (PTI)

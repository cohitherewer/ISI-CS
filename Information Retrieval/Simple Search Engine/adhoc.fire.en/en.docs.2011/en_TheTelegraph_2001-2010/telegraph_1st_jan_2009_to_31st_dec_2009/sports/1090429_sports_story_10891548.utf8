The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | First, relax and enjoy, SRK to his Knights
                                                     First, relax and enjoy, SRK to his Knights
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Shah Rukh                           
	Durban: Shah Rukh Khan didnt read the riot act during his 20-minute interaction with the Kolkata Knight Riders, in Port Elizabeth, after the massive 92-run defeat at the hands of the Mumbai Indians on Monday evening.         
	Instead, the franchises principal owner asked the Brendon McCullums to relax and enjoy their cricket before looking for wins in the ongoing edition of the IPL.         
	Theyve only had one (from five matches) in the tournament and shared points with the Chennai Super Kings after a wash-out in Cape Town.         
	Youre like my children and I cant scold my children... First, try to relax and enjoy your cricket before worrying about winning... Once the enjoyment is there, the results will improve, Shah Rukh is understood to have told his Knights at the St Georges Park dressing room.         
	According to a well-placed source of The Telegraph, hed added: The team isnt gelling because youre not enjoying your cricket... Im not blaming anybody, though...         
	Things couldve been very different had we not lost to the Rajasthan Royals in the Super Over or if Sachin (Tendulkar) or (Sanath) Jayasuriya had given a chance early and wed taken it in this match...         
	Dont lose heart, then, was Shah Rukhs theme. He has himself received much stick for the way Sourav Ganguly was sacked as captain just days before this edition got under way.         
	Shah Rukhs returning home and may come back for the last few matches. Much, perhaps, will depend on how the Knights perform in the next 10-12 days.         
	The Knights next match, against the Bangalore Royal Challengers, is here on Wednesday. Both teams are poorly placed.

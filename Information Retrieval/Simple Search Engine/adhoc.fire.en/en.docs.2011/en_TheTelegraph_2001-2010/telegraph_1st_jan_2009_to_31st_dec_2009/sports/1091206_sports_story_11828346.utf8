  - Individuals are only concerned about team goals, says coach         OUR CORRESPONDENT            Zaheer Khan celebrates one of his wickets with Yuvraj Singh, at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai, on Saturday. (AP)                                 
	Mumbai: India coach Gary Kirsten said at a press conference Saturday that he was hopeful that Mahendra Singh Dhonis men would be able to notch up a victory in the third and final Test against Sri Lanka and, in the process, move to the top of the Test rankings.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Indias performance         
	A great day At the start of the day, we had set ourselves a target of taking six wickets and we are happy that we have achieved it. All the bowlers did really well. As a group, they bowled exceptionally well.         
	Virender Sehwags show         
	I have seen a lot of Sehwag knocks that are highly entertaining and he continues to do it. The triple century that he got last year was also entertaining. But even when Viru gets 40, it is an exciting knock. He adds massive value to our team  Even if he is getting out for a low score, he does it at such a fast rate that the new man walking in is not under pressure to score runs quickly. And when he does get going, he gets a big score.         
	Sehwag missing the triple century         
	He obviously would have liked to get a triple hundred, but he didnt show that disappointment in the dressing room and that is what is exciting about this team. The individuals in this team are concerned about Team Indias goals. They know that individual glories will eventually come their way.         
	On Murali Vijay         
	Hes a fantastic player and took his opportunities. I was pleased with the way he went about his business in the first innings. But the guy (Gautam Gambhir) he has replaced has done reasonably well for the last two years and I dont think hed be giving up his position very quickly.         
	Sri Lankas batting         
	Batsmen like (Kumar) Sangakkara dont give up that easily. Thats why he is one of the worlds best. We dont know about their plans. We have enough time to take the remaining four wickets and chase down a target.         
	On the chance of becoming No.1 in Tests         
	It will be great. It is certainly something we aspired We wanted to become the best test team in the world. That will be a great achievement for this team. Hopefully, we can achieve that Sunday. A lot of credit goes to the players. They have all stood up to be counted at various times in these last 18 months. We have got a very powerful batting line-up and the bowlers have done their job. I am very happy from that perspective.         
	The secret of success         
	We set a goal and then just focus on what we need to do What we try to achieve in every match, how we set up the match or plans to make sure that we dont lose. In the last 18 months, we really focused on what we needed to do  every day, in every match and series. We knew that if we set that up day in and day out, there would be a time when we would become the best team in the world.         
	Plans for the future         
	We need to continue the way we are playing now We will have to perform well in all conditions. That is what we have been doing for the last 18 months and we need to continue that.

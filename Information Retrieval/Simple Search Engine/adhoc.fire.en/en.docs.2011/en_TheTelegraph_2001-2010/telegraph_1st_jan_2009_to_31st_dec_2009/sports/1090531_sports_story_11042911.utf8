The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We have a solid team, says Tendulkar
                                                     We have a solid team, says Tendulkar

	Singapore: Explosive batting order, effective bowling unit and the presence of world class players make India a formidable force and there is no reason why they cannot defend the title in next months ICC World Twenty20 Championship in England, feels Sachin Tendulkar.         
	Tendulkar, who was here on a promotional programme, said the Indian team looked absolutely balanced and he was optimistic that they would defend the title they had won in 2007.         
	Ive full confidence in the team. Its a solid team that has got explosive batsmen and some wonderful bowlers in their attack which looks fantastic. The team has got some world class players as well, he said.         
	Despite having a star-studded line-up, openers Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhirs inconsistency has been a reason to worry for the team management but Tendulkar did not sound too perturbed.         
	Form can sometimes go down and you may not play well at times. But I believe a world class player is always a threat to the opposition and Im really glad that we have so many world class players in the side, Tendulkar said.         
	Even though purists tend to dismiss Twenty20 as just slam-and-bang cricket, Tendulkar begged to differ and said it augured well for the game.         
	I think it is good for cricket. It generates interests in areas where we dont have major tournaments. Its fast, exciting and you know the result within three hours, he said.

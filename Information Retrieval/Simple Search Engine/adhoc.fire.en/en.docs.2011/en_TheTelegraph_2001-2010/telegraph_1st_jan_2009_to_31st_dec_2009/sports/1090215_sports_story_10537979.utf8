The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lalawmpuiya creates a ruckus once again
                                                     Lalawmpuiya creates a ruckus once again
            A STAFF REPORTER            Lalawmpuiya                           
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan striker P.C. Lalawmpuiya was arrested and later released on a personal bond for drunken driving and riding a bike without helmet in the wee hours of Saturday.         
	An inebriated Lalawmpuiya, who has a history of finding himself in the headlines for reasons other than football, had a heated exchange with a passer-by after coming out of a 5-star hotel pub.         
	He was arrested and taken to the local police station where he failed the alcohol test. There was too much alcohol in his blood, a club source told The Telegraph. Lalawmpuiya was released at around 4 am in the morning.         
	The Mizo striker, who joined Bagan in 2006, in fact, was supposed to be in the 18-member squad for Sundays I-League encounter against Mohammedan Sporting. He came for the afternoon practice but club officials sent him back. He would not find a place in the squad on Sunday.         
	We will meet on Monday to decide our future course of action, club secretary Anjan Mitra told the mediamen later on Saturday evening.         
	Lalawmpuiya has failed to do justice to his class thanks to his wayward lifestyle.         
	Whether beating up the cook at the club mess or getting into an argument with skipper Bhaichung Bhutia, Lalawmpuiya is known for losing cool at the drop of a hat.         
	He has the talent but it is going waste, lamented coach Karim Bencharifa. He needs proper guidance if we dont want to see a promising youngster going astray, Bencharifa sounded worried about his striker.

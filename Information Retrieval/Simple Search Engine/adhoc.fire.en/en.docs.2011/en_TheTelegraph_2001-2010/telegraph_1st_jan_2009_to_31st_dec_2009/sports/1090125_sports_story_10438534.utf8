	Calcutta: East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick said his teams performance against United SC on Saturday could fulfil only half his expectations, but added that he was not disappointed with the result.         
	He described his teams performance as average.         
	Asked to what extent his team fulfilled his expectations, Bhowmick said: The boys performed to 40-45 per cent of what I expected.         
	But Im not disappointed. Nothing can happen overnight Im standing on a realistic platform.         
	Sunil Chetri, meanwhile, left the city for his trial at Coventry City. Chetri was unsure of calls from other British clubs but said he would talk with his agent regarding the issue. He will return next Saturday.

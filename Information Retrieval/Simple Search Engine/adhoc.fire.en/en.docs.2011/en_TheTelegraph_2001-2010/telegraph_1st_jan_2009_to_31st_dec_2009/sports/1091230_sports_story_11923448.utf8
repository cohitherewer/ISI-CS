The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United aura has faded: Capello
                                                                                                                       7                                        United aura has faded: Capello
  - Berbatov insists Red Devils will win a record fourth successive EPL crown       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Fabio Capello                                 
	England manager Fabio Capello has said Manchester United are not the war machine that once ruled the Premier League. The champions have failed to hit the heights this season following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo in the summer.         
	United remain in contention for silverware both at home and on the continent, but Capello believes their aura has faded.         
	Manchester United were a war machine and they have slowed down, he told an Italian newspaper.         
	Assessing Uniteds title rivals, Capello added: Chelsea are fine, but the other teams are getting better  Arsenal and Aston Villa and then those teams further behind. (Roberto) Mancinis Manchester City and (Alberto) Aquilanis Liverpool will pick up speed.         
	Meanwhile, Dimitar Berbatov has raised the stakes in the title race by insisting that Manchester United will see off Chelsea to win a record fourth successive Premier League crown.         
	The Bulgaria striker did not go as far as to write off Arsenals chances of winning the league, but he believes that Chelsea will represent the biggest threat to his teams hopes of making history.         
	Second-placed United have lost five league matches this season, including two of their past four games in the competition, and they again failed to impress in the 3-1 win away to Hull City on Sunday.         
	But Berbatov is confident that the victory at the KC Stadium will serve as the catalyst for a winning run, continuing against Wigan Athletic at Old Trafford on Wednesday.         
	I think that we are in a great position, Berbatov said. There are still a lot of games to go and it will be difficult. I think it will be decided between us and Chelsea but in the end I think well end up on top. We have great players so lets see what happens. There are a lot of games at this time of year but if you win every one we have a great chance.         
	It was an important win for us [against Hull]. Weve had a difficult time with injuries, but we still have a great squad. Players are starting to come back and we will go on a winning run now.         
	Sir Alex Ferguson, the United manager, believes that the team will benefit considerably from the return from injury of Nemanja Vidic, Brown and the Da Silva brothers, Rafael and Fabio. Jonny Evans and Gary Neville are also expected to return shortly, although the prognosis for Rio Ferdinand and John Shea is less clear.         
	In another development, goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar has been told to take off as much time as he needs by Ferguson after his wife was taken seriously ill over the Christmas holidays.         
	Annemarie van Kesteren, 36, collapsed at their home in the Netherlands two days before Christmas and has suffered a brain haemorrhage and a suspected stroke.         
	Ferguson said he had given the goalkeeper time off to look after his wife and their two children.         
	Annemarie had a problem over in Holland a week ago and has been admitted to hospital, Ferguson said. That is the best place for her to be. They have examined her twice and are trying to get to the root of it.

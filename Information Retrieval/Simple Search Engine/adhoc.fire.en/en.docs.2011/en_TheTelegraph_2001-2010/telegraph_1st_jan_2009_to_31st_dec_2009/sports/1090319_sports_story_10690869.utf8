            A STAFF REPORTER            Sourav Ganguly and Laxmi Ratan Shukla at the Eden on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly on Wednesday said playing all home matches in the Indian Premier League at a go would not be ideal but Kolkata Knight Riders must get used to it.         
	Under the tentative revised schedule, Calcutta will host seven matches between April 11 and 26, well before polling in the state begins.         
	You cant help it Weve got to get used to itTheres nothing much we can do about it. This is the best option in the circumstances Playing all the home matches at a go is not ideal but its the only solution available right now, Sourav said.         
	Sourav joined the KKR preparatory camp at the Eden on Wednesday. Also present were Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Sourav Sarkar and Debabrata Das among others.         
	Players, who were engaged in the Deodhar Trophy in Cuttack, are expected to join practice within a couple of days.         
	Sourav was impressed with the players attending the camp. I am very happy with the kind of talent that is available. I am sure by the end of this camp, two or three players will make the cut for the final squad.         
	The former India captain batted for quite some time at the nets besides going through the fitness drills under the watchful eyes of trainer Adrian le Roux. The players will play two practice matches on Thursday between themselves.         
	Meanwhile, David Hussey will miss all of Knight Riders home matches as per the tentative revised schedule. The Australian will be available only after May 7 because of his national commitments  ODIs versus South Africa, followed by the series against Pakistan.

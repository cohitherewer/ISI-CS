                                                   Proteas looking at the positives
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: South Africa are looking at the positives despite crashing out of the World T20 in the semi-finals.         
	The most important undoubtedly is the fact that they finally seem to be getting to grips with death bowling which has been an ongoing problem in both the limited-overs formats for some time now.         
	This was one of the biggest positives to come out of our campaign, said coach Mickey Arthur in a release. The way Dale Steyn and Wayne Parnell closed both the West Indies and Pakistan down in the last four overs of what were very tight matches was very encouraging. Looking ahead to the Champions Trophy these two look to have solved one of our few problem areas.         
	The 19-year-old Parnell was probably the standout performer for South Africa in the tournament with his ability to fire in yorkers almost at will and to adapt to the changing match circumstances.         
	Two of the other star performers for South Africa were Jacques Kallis, who finished as the second leading run-scorer in the tournament, and Roelof van der Merwe.         
	Van der Merwe finished among the top six wicket-takers. Few people will also forget the stunning catch he took at Trent Bridge to remove England dangerman Kevin Pietersen.

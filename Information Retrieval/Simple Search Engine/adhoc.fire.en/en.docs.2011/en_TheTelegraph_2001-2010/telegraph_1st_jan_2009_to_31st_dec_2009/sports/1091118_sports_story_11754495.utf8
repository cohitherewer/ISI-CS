	Ahmedabad: Muttiah Muralidharan was taken to a hospital for a precautionary check-up Tuesday after the end of the Indian innings.         
	Murali complained of dizziness and stomach pain after returning to the dressing room.         
	He was rushed to the hospital from the ground. He was treated for dehydration and discharged after a few hours. He is back in the team hotel and there is nothing to worry. He will be fit to play on Wednesday, a member of the team management said.         
	Murali, it was learnt, had not been keeping well since the opening day of the Test because of a stomach bug.         
	Meanwhile, Thilan Thusara has been ruled out of the Test series because of a shoulder injury. Dilhara Fernando will replace him and is expected to arrive Wednesday.         
	Thusara will need at least two to three weeks to recover. He will return, manager Brendon Kuruppu said.

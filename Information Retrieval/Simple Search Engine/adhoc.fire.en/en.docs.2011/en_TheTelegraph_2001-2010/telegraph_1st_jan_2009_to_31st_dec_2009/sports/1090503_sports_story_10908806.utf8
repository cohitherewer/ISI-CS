The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hewitt fears for his Cup career 
                                                   Hewitt fears for his Cup career 
                      
	Melbourne: A disappointed Lleyton Hewitt says his Davis Cup career could be over if the Tennis Australia (TA) was banned from competing in the tournament next year for boycotting the tie against India.         
	Now, once again, we are in the hands of the ITF regarding any sanction they may impose on Tennis Australia and the Australian Davis Cup team, Hewitt said. That decision could have severe ramifications for me as a player, and could effectively end my Davis Cup career, he wrote on his blog.         
	Whilst I have been a winning team member twice, I would be devastated if this was the way my Davis Cup career ended. As far as Im concerned I still have unfinished business of getting Australia back into the World Group, he added.         
	The 28-tear-old said the ITFs failure to move the May 8-10 India tie from Chennai to a neutral venue was possibly the most disappointing of all.         
	I had made the commitment to forgo my French Open preparations to play in India.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The SRK statement
                                                     The SRK statement
                              
	The following is the statement issued by Shah Rukh Khan, principal owner of the Kolkata Knight Riders, after a meeting in Mumbai on Tuesday:         
	Needless to say the term multi captains has raised a few eyebrows and questions. The idea is to have a set of strategists as is always the case classically in cricket, who will form a team of 4 to 5 core experts in the field of fielding, bowling, batting and data, etc. These coaches or strategists will assist the one captain on field with their viewpoints on the game-plan set earlier or shoot from the hip as the case maybe. The captain for the team is one and only one as is the case in most sports. Just the roles which are there in the regular format of the game as the fielding expert, batting coaches, are being better defined to be able to give quick suggestions as in the case of baseball and some other faster paced sports. All internal decisions are taken collectively by the core cricketing team which comprises of John, Sourav, Matthew Mott and a few others. There is no dissent on that ever. Even this confusion is caused because these roles got described as multiple captains a day before the joint press conference between John and Dada. We have immense respect for the two most senior members of our KKR team and all decisions are taken in tandem. As the team is not decided because of all overseas venue changes, etc we will take the call on the issue of captain, vice-captain, the team, post the sessions in South Africa, prior to the first game. Reason for doing so is not to shirk the issue of who is the captain but to announce all that together to make that a cohesive decision from the team management to avoid confusion like it has resulted right now. So please can we now lay to rest all theories on how John and Dada relate to each other and let us get on with the more important aspect of getting together the best team to play in the tournament.

                                                   Feeling a lot better now:   McCullum
            OUR BUREAU                            
	Brendon McCullum, the Kolkata Knight Riders captain, revealed that he finally felt a lot better and will enjoy the night after his team managed to snap their losing streak in the Indian Premier League on Monday, notching up a thrilling last-ball victory over the formidable Chennai Super Kings.         
	It feels a lot better, having won this match. We have been playing well for the last couple of matches, but we ended up on the wrong side in them. It was better this time, said the New Zealander, after the Knight Riders seven-wicket victory.         
	The last 3-4 weeks have been really tough. We had to pick ourselves up and perform at our best. So, it was nice to win the game. We can enjoy the night, McCullum added.         
	Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni slammed his bowlers for putting up a poor show in the match.         
	We got the runs today (Monday). But some brilliant batting by the Knight Riders batsmen and one of the worst bowling performances of the IPL by our bowlers cost us the match, Dhoni said.         
	The Indian captain admitted that they were totally outplayed by their rivals.         
	Im a bit disappointed. We were in an advantageous position after putting up a challenging target, but failed to bowl properly.         
	We still have to win one more game. It was a similar situation last year when we had to win the last match to make it to the semi-finals. We cant afford any speculations now. We are a good side and we will have to bat and bowl well to win the next match, said Dhoni.         
	Man of the Match Brad Hodge (71 ..) said that he, too, was happy to help his team to a victory.         
	Weve been trying our best, but it was not happening. We did it today. SRK (Shah Rukh Khan) must also be happy with the result, said the Australian.         
	Brendon was brilliant today. He smashed the ball to all parts of the ground. I enjoyed batting with him and our partnership did the trick, Hodge added.

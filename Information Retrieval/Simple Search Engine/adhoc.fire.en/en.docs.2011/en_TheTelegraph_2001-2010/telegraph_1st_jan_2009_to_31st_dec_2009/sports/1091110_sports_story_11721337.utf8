	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly is not reading much into his comeback to first class cricket on Tuesday. But his presence is enough to redraw the oppositions plans.         
	The former India captain, who last played against Goa in Delhi during Bengals promotion to Elite group in 2008, will be turning out against Baroda at the Eden.         
	Bengal won their opening Ranji match against Maharashtra in Pune last week.         
	Dont read too much into my playing I will be playing a four-day match after a long while. The batting shouldnt be entirely dependent on me, said Sourav, after more than two hours of practice on Monday.         
	After a round of fielding practice, Sourav got down to some knocking before discussing strategies with the thinktank.         
	The Sourav factor, though, is keeping Baroda on their toes.         
	 He comes in with a wealth of international experience and that will obviously help Bengal Theres no doubt he will be a big factor. But we also have plans in place for him, said Baroda coach Paras Mhambrey.         
	Sourav feels Bengal, despite the absence of four frontline players, will start with an advantage at home. Ours is a good team and we should do well. This is a good opportunity for youngsters and they should grab this chance, he said.         
	Roger Binny is also confident that Souravs availability will come in handy. His experience is an asset. He will prove to be a motivation for the youngsters in the side, said the Bengal coach.         
	Laxmi Ratan Shukla is aware that Souravs presence will help him on the field.         
	What can I say about him? His presence will be of great help Im sure we will do well in this game too. The aim will be to maintain the momentum and the same intensity, said the Bengal captain.         
	Sourav, too, is aware of Barodas strengths and the Pathan brothers. They are a good side Irfan is making a comeback from injury. He will be raring to go.         
	Does he have a message for the Pathan brothers? Dont hit too many sixes, he quipped before leaving the Eden.

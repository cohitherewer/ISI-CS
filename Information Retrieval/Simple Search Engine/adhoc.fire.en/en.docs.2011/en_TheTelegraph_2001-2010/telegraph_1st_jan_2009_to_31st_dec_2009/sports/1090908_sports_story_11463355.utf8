The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ricky quits T20 for Australia
                                                   Ricky quits T20 for Australia
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Australia captain Ricky Ponting Monday announced his retirement from international T20s. However, Ponting will continue playing the shortest format in domestic competitions. Thus, the right-hander will keep turning out for the Tasmanian Big Bash team where possible, and also fulfil his contract with the Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League.         
	Ponting will remain captain of the Australian Test and one-day sides but will step away from the international T20 format in an effort to prolong his playing career.         
	Ponting said: I feel this decision provides me the opportunity to prolong my Australian Test and one-day career, an opportunity I am extremely determined about.         
	As I said after the fifth Test in London, I am hoping to continue playing Test cricket for as long as possible and retiring from the T20 format gives me the best chance of doing this. I will now have set periods of rest throughout the Australian summer and while touring, which I feel will be very beneficial.         
	Cricket Australia (CA) has supported the captains decision while conceding that the gap left by Pontings retirement will be hard to fill.         
	As regards Pontings replacement, CA has said that according to the Board rules, the formality of announcement of a replacement captain requires CA Board approval. The CA national selection panel will make a recommendation for Board consideration at the next CA Board meeting, due to be held next month.         
	Australias next T20 International is on February 5 when they take on Pakistan in Melbourne.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Players were fatigued: Gary
                                                     Players were fatigued: Gary
    - TEAM INDIA COACH ADMITS THERE WAS LITTLE PREPARATION             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Gary Kirsten                                 
	Nottingham: Team India coach Gary Kirsten interacted with the media late on Monday, shortly after arriving from London. On the way out, he briefly spoke to The Telegraph separately.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Mood in the dressing room         
	I saw some pretty disappointed faces in the dressing room last evening... The hurt showed... (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni made a highly motivational speech on where we go from here... This team has come to have high expectations... Theres major disappointment around as weve let the Indian people down. We take the rap for having performed below par.         
	Reasons         
	Its not an excuse, but fatigue was a factor... The players arrived tired (after a gruelling IPL) and never got to the level of intensity which wouldve worked... It didnt help that we played two matches (against Bangladesh, Ireland) of relatively less intensity, in the first round of the World T20... Also, we had a fair number of players not in the best of form and some were carrying niggles (from the IPL).         
	Thanks to the IPL, not having had the time to prepare thoroughly         
	Some of the players only had a couple of days off (before leaving for England)... Because we werent together as a unit, we came with little preparation... Wed lost the connection (during the IPL).         
	Whether he would recommend that, in such a situation, some players be released from the later stages of an IPL edition         
	Dont know how that will be received, but that could be one way forward...         
	The IPL         
	Its basically a domestic tournament... Club-type with some international players... Theres a difference between the IPL and T20 Internationals.         
	Mistakes made         
	Tactical mistakes were made and the players didnt execute their skills in the manner expected of them... Some of the teams exposed us, but weve been practising facing the short-pitched balls...         
	Strange decisions regarding the batting orderWe dont want to be predictable with our batting line-up... Yesterday, Ravindra Jadeja did the job initially, but then got bogged down (at No.4)... Our plan was to have the big hitters  Yuvraj Singh, Dhoni and Yusuf Pathan  around in the last 10-12 overs, but the asking-rate kept climbing.         
	Whether Suresh Raina should have batted at No. 3 in the first round as well         
	Look, hindsight is the perfect science.         
	On Dhonis batting         
	Hes one of the great finishers in the game and is trying to find a way to close matches and, at the same time, play aggressively... I can only see him getting better.         
	Dhonis captaincy         
	Hes one of the best leaders Ive seen in any walk of life and he has the ability to shut out the external things.         
	Batsmen being out of form         
	Its largely mental when that happens.         
	Team India stumbling in T20 Internationals after winning the inaugural World T20         
	I accept that we havent been performing well... Other teams have got clever and have matched us in every department... We do have holes in our T20 and need to work on certain areas... This defeat is a big setback.         
	Optional training sessions having become the norm         
	You know, its tough when players have been on the road from the end of January... One is constantly wrestling with the issue of rest and practice... Youve got to realise that there are times when players need to get away from cricket.         
	Finally, the way the defeat has impacted on him         
	(Grins) This really is my first setback... Its tough, yes.

                                                   Change in XI likely
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal will have to recover quickly from a shock defeat against Assam in their first match of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy as they face Jharkhand Thursday.         
	Jharkhand, led by Saurabh Tiwary, had put up a stupendous performance in their first match, bundling out Tripura for a meagre 30 runs. Bengals middle order would have to put up a better show.         
	Bengal could also have a rethink on their bowling line-up as left-arm spinner Iresh Saxena was given a solitary over against Assam Wednesday and the team, struggling with their batting, would do better to go in with an extra batsman on the morrow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brazil drawn in the group of death

	Cape Town: Brazil have been drawn into the toughest group for next years World Cup in South Africa, facing Portugal and Ivory Coast in the first round. Brazil will face two teams in the top 16 of Fifas rankings as well as North Korea in Group G.         
	The draw was kind to all the other top teams.         
	Defending champions Italy are in Group F with Paraguay, New Zealand and Slovakia, while England are in Group C with the United States, Algeria and Slovenia.         
	European champions Spain were drawn into one of the easiest groups, facing Switzerland, Honduras and Chile, while France will face hosts South Africa in Group A, which also includes Mexico and Uruguay.         
	South Africa will face Mexico in the opening game on June 11. A huge gasp went up from the 3,000-strong crowd when Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron announced that Mexico would play the opener.         
	The picking of South Africas opponent for the opening match was one of the most anticipated moments of the World Cup draw ceremony.         
	I dont envy the Mexicans who are going to be subject to 90,000 vuvuzelas, said South Africa defender Matthew Booth, referring to the loud horns that Bafana Bafana fans love to use.         
	Worse was to come for South Africa when France, ranked seventh in the world, were also put in group A. The French will play the often decisive last group game against the hosts.         
	Sometimes no comments speak louder than words, said Theron, the presenter. Uruguay were the fourth team in the group.         
	Some of the opening matches have set World Cups off on the right track.         
	Four years ago, Germany was considered dour and short on attacking flair. After their 4-2 win over Bolivia, the host rode the momentum into the semi-finals and finally finished third.         
	In 2002, the opener was one of the biggest shockers when outgoing world champions France were supposed to have an easy ride against Senegal. Bouba Diop decided otherwise, leading the Africans to a perfect start with a 1-0 win. France never recovered and were eliminated in the group stage.         
	It was not the only time Africa made such a splash in the first game. In Milan in 1990, African football truly came onto the international scene when Oman Biyeck scored for Cameroon to beat defending champion Argentina. Diego Maradona and Argentina did recover from the shock and lost the cup only in the last minutes of the final against Germany.         
	Argentina had a similar start in 1982 in Spain, when they also were the defending champions. That time, Erwin Vandenbergh scored the only goal for an upset Belgian win.         
	There have also been some awful duds to kick off the World Cup, as three scoreless openers from 1966 to 1974 illustrate. As hosts, South Africa were already sure to play the opener at Soccer City.         
	The picking of South Africas opponent for the opening match was one of the most anticipated moments of a slick and glitzy ceremony on Friday for the World Cup draw and Nelson Mandela said his country was humbled to host the soccer spectacular for the first time on the continent.         
	Africas biggest economy has shrugged off persistent scepticism about its ability to stage the worlds most watched sporting event and it pulled out all the stops for the draw, which will decide the first round matches among the 32 teams.         
	Organisers fielded three Nobel Prize winners including Mandela, Africas most respected statesman, while its famous actress, Oscar winner Charlize Theron, hosted the draw.         
	International soccer greats, including Englands David Beckham and former players Eusebio of Portugal, Roger Milla of Cameroon, Germanys Franz Beckenbauer and Frances Michel Platini, the Uefa president, were also present.         
	As promised, the ceremony, watched by an estimated world television audience of 250 million from 200 countries, had a distinctly continental flavour with African dance troupes and singers fronted by Angelique Kidjo from Benin.         
	The programme included a video apparently showing lions, elephants and other wild animals playing soccer in the bush.         
	Theron, dressed in a bright red ball gown, said she was proud to come home from America where she lives most of the time.           (AGENCIES)

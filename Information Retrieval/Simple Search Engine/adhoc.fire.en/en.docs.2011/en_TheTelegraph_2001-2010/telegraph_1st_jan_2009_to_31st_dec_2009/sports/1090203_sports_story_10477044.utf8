                                                   Mental edge with Nadal, say experts
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Can Roger Federer beat Rafael Nadal? Can the world No. 1 players mental toughness match his physical fitness? One still wonders where it comes from: all that fury on court, all that hunger and singularity of purpose.         
	The Telegraph spoke to former Davis Cuppers to find the answers to the questions hovering on everyones mind.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Ramanathan Krishnan: Nadal is much younger to Federer and it is showing. Spaniards in general are great athletes and Nadal is no exception. His strong legs made all the difference in the final. He hit some impossible groundstrokes from unbelievable positions Those were match-winning shots. Nadal is physically stronger and ahead of Federer in the mental aspect too. In fact, the physical and mental aspects are inter-connected. Youve got to admit that the Nadal era has begun.         
	Naresh Kumar: I feel Federer has developed a mental block when it comes to playing Nadal. He is not confident enough against the world No.1. No doubt Federers getting on in years but that is no reason for his defeat. If you keep losing to someone, it affects your confidence. Wimbledon (grass) is his favourite surface but he has lost there too The way Nadal dominates his opponents is amazing. Hes bouncing like a boxer even before the start. This has an effect on the opponent.         
	Jaidip Mukerjea: While Federer is not getting younger, Nadal is becoming stronger. Its a mental game for Federer. Sundays final will have take a lot out of Federer. He can beat Nadal, but not in a Grand Slam.         
	Akhtar Ali: Federer can beat Nadal but only on grass. That means he will have a fair chance at Wimbledon. Nadal is matching Federer in every aspect, be it physical or mental.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chetri return set to be delayed
                                                   Chetri return set to be delayed
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick is unperturbed by the fact that his key striker Sunil Chetri may not join the side in the next two weeks.         
	Chetri is currently in England to appear for trials at the League Championship club Coventry City. The diminutive forward is on a seven-day leave from East Bengal, but reports suggest that he may take another week before returning to Calcutta.         
	Bhowmick said he had no information about Chetri from the time the striker walked out of the dressing room after the goalless draw against Chirag United in the I-League match.         
	He hasnt contacted me so far. But I will not be upset if he doesnt come back within a week, Bhowmick said. I know he is appearing for trials at Coventry City. I will be the happiest person on earth if he manages to strike a deal there. It will be a historic occasion for Indian football.         
	Bhowmick said he was aware that his team were struggling in the I-League but he would not insist for Chetris early return. I am eagerly looking forward for Chetri to break the deadlock. With 13 points from 12 outings, East Bengal are currently placed eighth in the 12-team I-league.         
	According to reports, Coventry City boss Chris Coleman is planning to keep Chetri for at least two weeks before taking a decision on the East Bengal striker.         
	Coventry City, popularly known as the Sky Blues, is based 95 miles northwest of London.         
	They are currently placed 14th in the League Championship.

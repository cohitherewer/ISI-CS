            Ranji Round Up             Virat Kohli scored 88 n.o.                       
	New Delhi: Stand-in captain Virat Kohli led from the front with an unbeaten 88 as Delhi spanked Saurashtra by eight wickets to pocket five points from their Ranji Trophy Super League Group B match here Friday.         
	Chasing a 160-run target, the hosts cruised to 161 for two in 32 overs with Kohli and Mithun Manhas (23) guiding them to victory.         
	It turned out to be a memorable outing for Kohli who was asked to lead the side in the absence of regular skipper Aakash Chopra. Saurashtra were bowled out in their second innings for 214.         
	In Pune, riding on a brilliant batting display by Parvinder Singh and Piyush Chawla, visitors Uttar Pradesh came close to an improbable victory before falling short by 31 runs, as their Group B match against Maharashtra ended in a draw Friday.

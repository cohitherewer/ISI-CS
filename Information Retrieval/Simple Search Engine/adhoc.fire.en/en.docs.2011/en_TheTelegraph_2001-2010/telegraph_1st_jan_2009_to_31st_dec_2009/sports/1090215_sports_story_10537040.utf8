The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania to take on Vera in final
                                                     Sania to take on Vera in final
                              
	Pattaya: Sania Mirza will have to beat world No.5 and top-seed Russian Vera Zvonareva to claim the second WTA singles title of her career as the two players set up the summit clash in the $220,000 Pattaya Open here Saturday.         
	Sania edged past world No.51 Magdalena Rybarikova in the first semi-final, winning 6-4, 5-7, 6-1 Saturday while Zvonareva beat Shahar Peer of Israel 6-1, 6-4 in the other last-four clash.         
	The unseeded Indian, ranked 126th, faced tough challenge from her eighth seeded Slovakian opponent but eventually came out triumphant from a contest that lasted two-hours.         
	The last time Sania reached the singles final of a WTA event was in 2007 in the Stanford classic.         
	This is the fourth time in her career that Sania has reached the singles final of a WTA tour event.         
	She had become the first Indian to win a WTA title with her victory in the Hyderabad Open in 2005.         
	In the same year, she had reached the final of the Forest Hill event in the United States. Sania could have finished her semi-final against Rybarikova in the second set when she was serving for the match at 5-4, but she dropped her serve, allowing the issue to be stretched to the third set.         
	I missed a couple of easy points and lost the second set. It happens, Sania said after the match.         
	About the final against Beijing Olympics bronze medallist Zvonareva, Sania said: Im not going to think about who Im playing in the final, I just want to play my game, she said.         
	Sania broke Rybarikova in the fourth game of the deciding third set to take a 3-1 lead. She converted the first of her three breakpoints, earned after the Slovakian double faulted.         
	Sania consolidated the lead after holding her serve in the next game before breaking Rybarikova to make it 5-1.         
	The Indian then served out the match, converting her third match point.           (PTI)

	Mumbai: East Bengal put up a brave challenge before going down to hosts Mahindra United 2-3 in their I-League football second round match here on Wednesday.         
	The former champions shrugged off a damp pitch and lack of training in the lead up to the match to produce a strong showing but in the end a few defensive errors proved costly.         
	Mahindra were the superior team, though, and deserved to win despite allowing the visitors to dictate terms for a fair part of the game.         
	Subhas Bhowmicks men took the lead in the 29th minute through Alvito DCunha who slotted home from close range, the move coming from a quick counter after Mohammed Rafis bicycle kick at the other end hit the crossbar.         
	Subair Murithala Ali, Man of the Match, then came up with two opportunistic headers in the 34th and 43rd minutes to put Mahindra ahead 2-1 at half-time. Steven Dias provided the ball on the first occasion and NP Pradeep on the second.         
	Yusif Yakubu, coming on for Alvito after the break, had an immediate impact and got the equaliser for East Bengal as he tapped in a cross from Nirmal Chetri.         
	Things seemed to be going well for Bhowmicks men when a poor clearance by Mehrajuddin Wadoo left a loose ball outside the box and NP Pradeep blasted it into the net with a snap shot.         
	Notwithstanding the loss, East Bengal would go home with a mixed heart.         
	That they were able to match Mahindra despite going into the game with no proper practice since arriving in the city was creditable in itself.         
	Besides, Yakubu, who joined the team only two days back, displayed his class as he split the Mahindra defence time and again. Bhaichung Bhutia though was a shadow of his own.         
	The defence still remains a concern for Bhowmick.         
	That Murithala and Rafi were repeatedly able to find space in their box was a testimony in itself.         
	The hosts would be happy to have registered their first win of the season although they would be aware that the margin could have been bigger.         
	The heavy under-foot conditions, thanks to the rain of the previous two days, and the humidity tested the fitness of the players.         
	Mahindras Svetozar Mijin came off even before the end of first half and later Ali had to be stretchered off due to cramps. Similar was the case of Alvito.         
	Teams         
	Mahindra United: Subashish Roy Chowdhary, Debabrata Roy, Kalialaudeen Nisthar, D Ravanan, Denzil Franco, Steven Dias, Svetozar Mijin (Paresh Shivalkar, 43), K Ajayan, NP Pradeep, Subair Muritala Ali (Thoi Singh 79) and Mohd Rafi.         
	East Bengal: Abhra Mondal; Nirmal Chetri, Mehrajuddin Wadoo, Govin Singh, Saumik Dey; Mehtab Hossain, Riston Rodrigues (Harmanjot Singh Khabra 70), Rennedy Singh, Alvito DCunha (Yusif Yakubu 46), Bhaichung Bhutia, Sanju Pradhan (Subhash Singh 80).         
	Referee: A. Arjunan         
	MoM: Murithala Ali

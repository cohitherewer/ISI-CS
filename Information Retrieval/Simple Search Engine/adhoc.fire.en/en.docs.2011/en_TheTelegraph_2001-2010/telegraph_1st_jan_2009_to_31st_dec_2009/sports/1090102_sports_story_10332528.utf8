                                                   A busy year ahead for Bhutia amp; Co.
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Indian football team, which won the AFC Challenge Cup last August to qualify for the 2011 Asia Cup, is likely to have an extremely busy schedule this year.         
	The national team is expected to play at least half a dozen friendly matches and two tournaments at home  the Nehru Cup in August and the eight-nation SAFF Cup at the end of the year, according to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources. The teams first assignment will be a match against Hong Kong on January 14.         
	If the tentative schedule prepared by the AIFF is to be believed, footballers of the national team would find very little time to play for their respective clubs.         
	Apart from playing in two tournaments and a series of friendlies, the players are also likely to remain busy in a number of training camps to be held in Goa. While the first camp is beginning on Friday, the other camps will be organised in April, June/July and November. All camps will be of 10 to 15 days duration.         
	The AIFF has also planned to hold at least four separate camps this year for the Olympic qualifiers, which is likely to be played between February to November 2010. Only under-21 players will be called for the Olympic camps.         
	However, there could be some changes in the Olympic camp schedule as the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) is yet to finalise the format for the Olympic qualifiers.         
	The AFC might come up with a new format for the Olympic qualifiers, said the AIFF general secretary, Alberto Colaco. We will take a decision only after we get to know the format, he added.         
	Also, there are uncertainties over the dates of the Nehru Cup and the SAFF Cup. In 2007, the Nehru Cup was revived after 10 years by the ONGC, one of the main sponsors of the AIFF. They are supposed to fund the tournament once again this year, but according to sources, the AIFF is yet to approach the oil majors for financing the international meet.         
	We are yet to receive any fresh request from the AIFF, said a source in the ONGC.         
	The SAFF Cup is scheduled for December but the tournament secretariat, headed by the Nepal Football Federation president, Ganesh Thapa, is yet to announce the schedule. Pakistan are one of the competitors and they might find it difficult to get visas.         
	The tournament is in December and things may change by then, hoped Colaco.         
	Meanwhile, at the end of this week, national coach Bob Houghton will have a meeting with all the I-League coaches in Goa.

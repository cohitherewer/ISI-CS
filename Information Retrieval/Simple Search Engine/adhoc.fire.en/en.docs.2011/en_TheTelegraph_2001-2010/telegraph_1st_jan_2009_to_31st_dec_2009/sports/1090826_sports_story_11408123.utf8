The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India face Lanka in crunch tie
                                                   India face Lanka in crunch tie
            JAYDEEP BASU                       
	New Delhi: After successfully dealing with Kyrgyzstan, India have another giant battle on hand when they play Sri Lanka in the ONGC Nehru Cup at the Ambedkar Stadium on Wednesday.         
	The defeat against Lebanon in the opener has put the defending champions in a spot of bother. The victory against Kyrgyzstan was a relief but it wasnt enough to improve the situation. Anything less than victory against Sri Lanka can seriously hamper Indias chances of making the final of the five-nation tournament.         
	True, coach Bob Houghtons men have improved vastly over the last couple of years and are now looking to spread their wings and move beyond the level of regional supremacy. At the same time, between the two historic triumphs in the Nehru Cup and the AFC Challenge Cup, Indias performance against their neighbours in the 2008 SAFF Cup was hardly encouraging.         
	But things should be different on Wednesday.         
	If the victory against Kyrgyzstan did a world of good for Indias confidence, a capacity crowd at Indias favourite home turf would be there to will the Indians on in their quest for a third title in the capital.         
	If the matches are played at the Ambedkar Stadium, we can match the best teams in Asia, said Houghton. Crowd support plays a big role in football, he added.         
	Against Lanka, Surkumar Singh will return to the starting eleven in place of Deepak Mondal.         
	We have no other option but to win if we are to reach the final, said Houghton. Sometimes these teams play very well in the first match of the tournament. Afghanistan also played in the same way in the AFC Challenge Cup at Hyderabad.         
	Lanka are an enthusiastic team that plays attacking football irrespective of the strength of their opponents.         
	The open style of play paid rich dividends against Lebanon but it proved to be their downfall against Syria. Against India, the Lankans are likely to employ the same tactics since the Indian defence looked vulnerable under pressure in the previous encounter.         
	Lanka coach Sampath Pereira, who played for Mohun Bagan in the nineties, said he was definitely looking for three points against the Indians to stay in contention.         
	India are a good side but not unbeatable, Pereira said. We havent prepared as much as India have but we too are capable of reaching the final. Four of our boys are running temperatures, but still they gave their best against Syria. They should be fit for the India match.         
	Pereira, who has accused the organisers of favouring the hosts in the fixtures, said his defence would keep a check on Bhaichung Bhutia.         
	I was the Sri Lanka captain when Bhutia first played against us in 1995. So many years have passed but he is still a great force on the pitch, Pereira said.

                                                   Podium a year in advance: Mallya
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: It took Force India 30 races to record their first points in the Formula One circuit. But team owner Vijay Mallya is ecstatic that he has delivered on his promise of a podium finish a year in advance.         
	If you remember, we had promised to be among points in 2009 and be on the podium in 2010. So we have actually delivered on our podium promise in advance, Mallya said via a tele-conference from Spa-Francorchamps after Giancarlo Fisichella drove a fairytale race to finish second in the Belgian Grand Prix and score the teams first points.         
	So, what would be his target now? Every team tries to improve  When you do well obviously the bar gets raised. But this is what sports is all about. If you cannot raise the bar, you have no business being here You cant go backwards. Youve got to achieve a higher performance level.         
	Fisichella, though, was a tad disappointed. Its been another great day and it was an amazing result. Finishing second is a dream, just great. I am a little disappointed as I felt we could have won the race. I was unlucky with the safety car when Kimi (Raikkonen) came past me at the restart and overtook me with the KERS.         
	With this success, he is pinning high hopes on the next race  the Italian GP in Monza. Its my home race and am looking forward to it. I will concentrate hard and hope for improved results, Fisichella said.         
	Asked by The Telegraph, Mallya scotched rumours of Fisichellas reported move to Ferrari. Im not willing to talk about Ferrari All I can say is I have neither been approached by Ferrari nor has Fisichella told me anything about it Its just a speculation, he said.         
	Fisichella, on his part, also dismissed such talk saying it was speculation and rumours. Im just concentrating on Force India at this moment, he driver said.         
	Be it with Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League or Force India, Mallyas persistence with experience has paid off. While Anil Kumble led the Bangalore side to the second spot this year in the absence of Kevin Pietersen, Fisichella has proved to be a handful. Isnt age a deterrent?         
	One doesnt look at age only at excellence. Talent and capability count as well. Its a complete package, Mallya signed off.

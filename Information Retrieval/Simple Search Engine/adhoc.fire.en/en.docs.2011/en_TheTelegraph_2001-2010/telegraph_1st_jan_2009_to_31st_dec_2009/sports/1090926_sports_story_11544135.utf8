                                                   Intikhab Alam: Names dont matter, performance does
  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL: Pakistans coach on the India match plus more         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                            Intikhab Alam      
	Johannesburg: At 67, Intikhab Alam is the oldest coach, at least with a top-bracket national team. This, in fact, is his latest stint with Pakistan. Intikhabs CV is, of course, very impressive  coach during the 1992 World Cup win and when the World T20 was won this June.         
	A former captain, the soft-spoken Intikhab spoke to The Telegraph for around half-an-hour at the Sandton Sun.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q Having won the first match (against the West Indies), is some of the pressure off Pakistan?         
	A (Grins) We made things a little difficult for ourselves, on Wednesday night, but the good thing is that we won... Its definitely nice to start a tournament with full points.         
	The next match is against India, on Saturday... You dont have a good record against them in major tournaments, so just how much of a factor would that be?         
	Yes, thats a fact, but weve won the only meeting in the Champions Trophy (Birmingham, 2004)... Even otherwise, theres always a first... Weve got match-winners and, if they deliver, I dont see why we cant beat India... History doesnt change, but I wouldnt go back to the 2003 World Cup, when we lost in Centurion.         
	India came without Virender Sehwag and Zaheer Khan and, now, Yuvraj Singh is out as well. Makes it easy for Pakistan?         
	Having been a cricketer myself, the last thing Id like is a fellow-cricketer to be out of a tournament through injury... Yuvraj is a special player and I worked with him during my two years as Punjabs coach... Its a loss for India, but the team still has enough quality players... As for things becoming easy for us, well, the bottomline is that youve got to deliver... Names dont matter, performance does.         
	What is Indias strength?         
	Their batting, even without Sehwag and Yuvraj.         
	Weakness?         
	Indias bowling, I guess. The batting is superior... Its not that well be taking things lightly, though. Far from it.         
	To talk of Pakistan, whats your strength?         
	Our bowling... Weve got an excellent pace attack and good spinners in Shahid (Afridi) and (Saeed) Ajmal... The availability of Mohammed Asif is a boost... Hes experienced and, I assume, hungry to perform on his (post-ban) comeback.         
	Weakness?         
	Not being consistent with the bat.         
	You must be relieved captain Younis Khans injury isnt anything more than a hairline fracture (right little finger)...         
	Injuries happen... Younis is determined to play... Id left it to him.         
	What went wrong in Sri Lanka? A string of defeats so soon after the World T20 triumph... The momentum shouldve been with Pakistan...         
	We had two bad sessions in the Test series and that proved very costly... A rush of blood leading to poor shots... The team paid for that... We threw it away from winning positions...         
	Despite some very experienced players...         
	It happened... Some things cant be explained, but have to be accepted... The good thing is that we won the last two ODIs and the one-off T20... We didnt, at least, end on a losing note. Overall, in my view, we played better cricket... The reality, of course, is that Sri Lanka won both the Tests and the ODIs.         
	Was there infighting within the Pakistan team?         
	Not at all...         
	Then how did reports suggest that?         
	Look, theres a lobby working against the present set-up in the PCB and the masterminds think that by hurting the team theyll be hurting the PCB... Its very unfortunate.         
	So, as coach, you didnt have a tough time in Sri Lanka?         
	No.         
	But the defeats must have put you under pressure, more so because of the criticism back home?         
	Some former players seem to be quite jealous... Perhaps, they want to be in my place... I dont have an issue with constructive criticism, but it shouldnt get personal... Getting back to your question, no, I wasnt under pressure... Youve known me for years and would know that Im the positive sort         
	I suppose its fashionable for many in Pakistan to keep pulling the team down...         
	You could say so... Some, it appears, are still unable to digest the fact that we won the World T20... That this team and this management could do it... They seem to forget that this isnt anybodys personal team but that of the country.         
	Have you had problems with batting consultant Javed Miandad?         
	Not at all. Our roles are clearly defined and he doesnt interfere. Ive welcomed Javeds appointment... We have, in the past, worked with each other and Ive never faced problems. Ive known Javed from the time he was in his teens. Its disappointing that sections of the media make an issue when theres nothing at all.         
	Do you also agree that theres something very special about an India-Pakistan match?         
	Absolutely...         
	When was the last time that you were involved in an India-Pakistan clash?         
	Hmmm... I think during the 1999-00 tri-series in Australia, when I was the coach...Almost a decade ago...         
	Strategy apart, what will you be telling your players at the team meeting?         
	Dont let the pressure affect you. Ill be keeping it simple.         
	The last one: Would you or anybody in your support staff prepare a document for the players listing, among other things, something on sexual activity?         
	(Grins) No... If anything of that kind had to be communicated, it would be done one-on-one and strictly behind closed doors. A document wouldnt be prepared.

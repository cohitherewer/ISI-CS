The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Knights train with A-factor in mind
                                                   Knights train with A-factor in mind
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: Besides the change in temperature, the first batch of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), which has reached South Africa for the IPLs second edition, is having to cope with the difference in altitude.         
	While Calcutta, for example, is a mere nine metres above sea level, base Bloemfontein is as high as 1,395 metres. Accordingly, the first day of training, Friday, focused as much on pucca nets as on work-outs designed to accelerate the acclimatisation.         
	The Knights got down to business at the provincial capitals showpiece cricket stadium, OUTsurance Oval, which used to be Springbok Park before the era of sponsors.         
	Altitude is a factor and the players need to get used to the change... Some of the IPL venues are on a much lower altitude and, so, training in Bloemfontein should help us appreciably, KKRs team director Joy Bhattacharjya told The Telegraph.         
	The same training pattern could be followed for the next few days, leading up to the first warm-up match, against Free State, on Tuesday.         
	Its significant that the Knights physical trainer, Adrian le Roux, is a South African.         
	Besides four Bengal players, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Wriddhiman Saha, Ashok Dinda and Sourav Sarkar, others from India already there are Ajit Agarkar, Murali Kartik, Aakash Chopra, Cheteshwar Pujara, Sunny Singh and Shoaib Sheikh.         
	South Africas Morne van Wyk is around too.         
	According to Bhattacharjya, Sourav Ganguly (set to be retained captain), Mashrafe Mortaza and some of the others are expected on Monday. Brendon McCullum, Brad Hodge, Moises Henriques and the two Sri Lankans  Ajantha Mendis, Angelo Matthews  are due to reach after that lot.         
	One understands Ishant Sharma and Chris Gayle would be the last to report in Bloemfontein.         
	The KKR management had been hoping to have Mendis and Matthews from the very beginning, but Sri Lanka Cricket didnt exempt them from an ongoing national camp.         
	Meanwhile, Bhattacharjya said that an effort was being made to meet Allan Donald not necessarily for help.         
	The one-time South Africa spearhead hails from Bloemfontein, though he now spends much of his time in England.         
	Unless theres a change in plan, the Knights will train till April 15/16, before heading for Cape Town, venue of their first match, on April 19.

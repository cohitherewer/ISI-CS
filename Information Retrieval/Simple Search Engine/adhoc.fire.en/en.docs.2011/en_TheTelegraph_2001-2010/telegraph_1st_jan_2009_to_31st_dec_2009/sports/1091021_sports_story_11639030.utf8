The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chance for Bagan reserves
                                                   Chance for Bagan reserves
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Calcutta Football League (CFL) could be a blessing in disguise for Mohun Bagan as it provides the club with a chance to test their reserves. Bagan play Kalighat Club in their opener on Wednesday.         
	Its true that the CFL, being held simultaneously with the I-League, means Bagan have a packed schedule. But for a club like Bagan, who are struggling to field their first team either due to injuries or suspensions, the CFL provides an excellent opportunity to sharpen the reserves.         
	As Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa put it Tuesday: The Sunday derby (against East Bengal) is of primary importance to us. We will try out some of our reserve strength tomorrow (Wednesday) and the match will help us keep them in fine shape.         
	The green and maroon briade, like archrivals East Bengal, have registered only one foreigner (Edeh Chidi) for the league. As of now, we will go with Chidi. It is a marathon league and whether or not to include another foreigner can be decided later, the coach said.         
	Suraj Mondal, in all probability, will be partnering Chidi upfront.         
	Kalighat are one of the teams who have been promoted to the premier division because of the Indian Football Associations decision to merge the first and the premier divisions.

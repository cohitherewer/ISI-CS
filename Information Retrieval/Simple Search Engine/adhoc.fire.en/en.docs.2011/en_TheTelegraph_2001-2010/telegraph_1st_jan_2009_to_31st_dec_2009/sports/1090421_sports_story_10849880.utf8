The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev ends tied 37th 
                                                   Jeev ends tied 37th 
                      
	Hilton Head (US): Jeev Milkha Singh signed off with his worst card of the week, a one-over 72, to finish tied 37th in the $5.7 million Verizon Heritage golf tournament.         
	The seasoned Indian pro finished with an aggregate of one-under 283 even though it was good enough to pocket a $22,230 cheque.         
	Jeev had an ominous start to his final round campaign as the Asia No. 1 double bogeyed the opening hole, a par-four.         
	He bogeyed the eighth and 10th holes as well before minimising the damages with three birdies, two of which came on the back nine.         
	Meanwhile, a final-round 64 capped Brian Gays (264) sensational week here where he captured his second career title with a huge 10-stroke lead over Luke Donald (66) and Briny Baird (68).

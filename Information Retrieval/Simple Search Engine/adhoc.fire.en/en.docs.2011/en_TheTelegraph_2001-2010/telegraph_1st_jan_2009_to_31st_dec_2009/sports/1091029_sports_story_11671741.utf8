                                                     Gilchrist wants balanced schedule
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Gilchrist                           
	New Delhi: Former Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist rates the India-Australia rivalry at par with the Ashes or an Indo-Pak duel, but doesnt want them to play against each other frequently.         
	The India-Australia rivalry is wonderful for cricket. It has caught the imagination of the cricket world, said the Deccan Chargers skipper on the sidelines of a promotional here.         
	The Ashes has history and so has India-Pakistan rivalry. But I would like a balance in India-Australia cricket which has its own identity; a balance where people want more of it and not feel it has reached a saturation point, he said.         
	Gilchrist also agreed with Australian captain Ricky Pontings concern about the hectic scheduling of the game these days. The scheduling has been a concern, especially in the last six weeks. I agree with Ricky It is difficult to get the balance right. For the administrators, it is a difficult juggling act and something has to be done, he admitted.         
	We are playing too much cricket. We need to monitor it. I am concerned about the spectator fatigue. It must be difficult for them to keep up with all the variations of the game. And then the injuries mean the players have to perform a delicate balancing act too, said Gilchrist. The Australian also felt that the present day cricketers should be able to set their priorities and manage their game carefully.         
	The burnout issue is there, but then the player has to be smart about management. The lucrative dollars are there but you have to be successful for the national team to reap the rewards in tournaments like the IPL and the Champions League, commented Gilchrist. Here too we need to monitor the youngsters. Look at Ponting He gave himself more time to represent Australia.         
	Gilchrist wasnt in agreement with the suggestion that Test cricket was in danger of extinction because of the popularity of one-day Internationals and Twenty20 cricket.

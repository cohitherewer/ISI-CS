The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chirag begin CFL journey
                                                                                                                                     Chirag begin CFL journey
            A STAFF REPORTER            Eduardo Chacon                           
	Calcutta: Eduardo Chacon, Safar Sardar and Denson Devadas are few of the regular players who will get a start when Chirag United open their CFL Premier Division campaign against BNR at the Barasat Stadium on Tuesday.         
	Sandip Nandy is likely to replace Somnath Khanra under the bar.         
	The coach is expecting that Sandip who hasnt had the best of times during recent outings can get his confidence back playing against lesser known outfits.         
	The positive aspect about the local league is that some of the senior players can get back to form.         
	A good save or a good goal gives you that required confidence before you take on the big boys, Bhattacharya stated after a morning training session at the Central Park in Salt Lake on Monday.         
	The main problem for Chirag will be the frontline. Edmilson is barred from playing in the local league since he already played the IFA Shield for East Bengal.         
	The rule states that a player cannot play two tournaments, organised by the same association, for two different clubs.         
	His Brazilian teammate Joshimar is also nursing a groin injury.         
	PC Lalampuiya took a knock on his left ankle on the day, while Ashim Biswas is still not match-fit.         
	It will all depend on East Bengal discard Parveen Kumar and young Anjan Dey to find the net. Youngster Ram Malik will be making his debut as a left winger.         
	BNR have already played two matches bagging four points.         
	They have won one and drawn the other. The railwaymen have an able guide in Maidan veteran in Tapan Jyoti Mitra, who knows a thing or two about snatching a point from big teams.         
	One of the prominent players for BNR will be their stopper Shyam Mondal. Shyam who had represented Mohammedan Sporting couple of seasons back under tutelege of Subhas Bhowmick was dubbed as fine talent till he preferred a secured government job over a career as a pro.         
	He was a star performer for Bengal during 2007 Santosh Trophy in Gurgaon where they lost to Punjab in the finals.

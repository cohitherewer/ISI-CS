	London: Injury-hit Manchester United can advance to the knockout round of the Champions League with a win over CSKA Moscow on Tuesday.         
	If United do secure a spot in the next round, manager Alex Ferguson will be able to field weakened teams in the two remaining Group B matches and focus on winning a fourth straight Premier League title.         
	United lead the group with nine points from three matches, with Wolfsburg in second with four and CSKA a further point behind. Last-place Besiktas host Wolfsburg in Tuesdays other group match.         
	While Ferguson want United to attack CSKA with purpose at Old Trafford, Wayne Rooney may be missing from the strike force. The England international was absent from training Monday because wife Colleen is set to give birth to their first child.         
	Central defensive partners Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic were also missing Monday after being ruled out of Saturdays victory over Blackburn in the Premier League with ankle injuries.         
	Chelsea can also advance to the knockout stage with a win at Atletico Madrid, a team still looking for their first victory in this seasons competition.         
	Chelsea lead Group D with nine points from three games, all won without conceding a goal. Atletico has only one point and has yet to score a goal in its three matches.         
	Coming off a 1-0 loss at Athletic Bilbao, new Atletico coach Quique Sanchez Flores must find a solution to the Spanish clubs woes before the team face Real Madrid four days after Chelseas visit.         
	Despite fielding Diego Forlan and Sergio Aguero in their attack, Atleticos offence has not found the goal. Chelsea, however, have Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka. Drogba has scored nine league goals to help Chelsea to a two-point lead over Manchester United at the top of the Premier League.         
	Meanwhile, AC Milan go into Tuesdays match at home to Real Madrid with their confidence boosted by an unbeaten run in October following the return to form of some key players.         
	Since the end of September, Leonardos team has moved up to fourth in Serie A following three wins and two draws. The run coincided with Milans 3-2 victory in Madrid in the last round of Champions League matches which lifted the Italian club to the top of Group C. (AP)         
	Among the players recapturing their best form is striker Marco Borriello, who overcame a year of back and groin complaints to score both goals in a 2-0 win over Parma at the weekend, while Ronaldinho is finally enjoying a consistent spell in the team.         
	In defence Alessandro Nesta has recovered from a series of injuries to form a solid central defensive partnership with Thiago Silva.         
	Im on the right road, but I feel I can do more, Borriello said. I cant wait for Tuesdays match. Im desperate to play, but ultimately the coach will decide.         
	We are now thinking about Tuesdays match against Real. Now is not the time to get carried away with my goals, as I already have to start thinking about the next ones.         
	Above all, the San Siro outfit is showing a resilience that was missing in the early part of the season. Little by little the team is coming together, midfielder Clarence Seedorf said. The players are happy, we know that the road is long, but the team is starting to trust in what we are doing.         
	Madrid go into the game with question marks over coach Manuel Pellegrinis future with the club.         
	The Chilean was blamed for Madrids 4-0 loss to third tier Alcorcon in the Copa del Rey, but he was given a stay of execution after the 2-0 win against Getafe on Saturday. Coupled with Barcelonas 1-1 draw with Osasuna it means Madrid is now one point behind the European champions in second place in the Spanish standings.

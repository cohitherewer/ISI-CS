            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: England have been fined for slow over-rate during their 84-run defeat to South Africa in the second T20 International at Centurion Sunday.         
	In accordance with the new ICC Code of Conduct regulations governing minor over-rate offences, players are fined 10 per cent of their match fees for every over their side fails to bowl in the allotted time, with the captain fined double that amount.         
	Match Referee Jawagal Srinath imposed the fine after Alastair Cooks side was ruled to be one over short of their target at the end of the match when time allowances were taken into consideration.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gautam Gambhir set to be   Dhonis deputy
                                                     Gautam Gambhir set to be   Dhonis deputy
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Gautam Gambhir                                 
	Johannesburg: Gautam Gambhir is set to be named Team Indias stand-in vice-captain, Mahendra Singh Dhonis latest deputy.         
	Sachin Tendulkar doesnt come into the picture and Harbhajan Singh isnt seen as a leader ... So, it has to be Gambhir, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Wednesday evening, he added: Some of the selectors have already had a discussion and, so, only the announcement is awaited.         
	Gambhir, though, may have his fingers crossed once he does get the No. 2 position. Injuries, after all, have struck the last two vice-captains  Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh.         
	In fact, Gambhir is himself coming off a groin injury.

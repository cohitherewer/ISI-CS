The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Flip-flop within on Yuvraj
                                                   Flip-flop within on Yuvraj
    - ODI series vs Australia A risk-free approach would delay senior pros return             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh during a break in training in Vadodara on Saturday, the eve of Indias first   one-dayer against Australia.      
	Vadodara: Yuvraj Singh has, over the past few days, made an extra effort to make a post-injury comeback on Sunday itself. However, a no-risk approach would delay his return to international cricket.         
	Thanks to flip-flops within, till late on Saturday, it wasnt clear whether Yuvraj would feature in the Hero Honda Cup-launching XI against Australia here.         
	Rather, conflicting signals kept emerging, a situation which would have been avoided had the selectors picked Yuvraj only after hed regained 100 per cent fitness.         
	The captain (Mahendra Singh Dhoni) and coach (Gary Kirsten) are happy with the way Yuvraj has been responding... Now, it appears the call has to be made entirely by the senior pro himself, a well-placed source told The Telegraph in the afternoon.         
	By the evening, though, word got around that Dhoni and Kirsten didnt want to take a risk at the very start of a seven-match contest with high stakes.         
	Of course, should Yuvraj (who fractured his right little finger at a training session in Johannesburg on September 23), take the field, the boost to Team India would be enormous.         
	In limited overs cricket, Yuvraj is now in the indispensable bracket and his performances would have an impact over the next few weeks as the teams criss-cross much of India.         
	The (day) game at the Reliance Cricket Stadium would actually mark the resumption of international cricket in the country after 10 months. One couldnt have asked for a more high profile series to set the ball rolling.         
	Going by the rankings, the Australians are marginally ahead, at No.1, but as vice-captain Mike Hussey acknowledged, beating India in India is probably the toughest challenge.         
	Hes experienced that.         
	Its confirmed that Virender Sehwag will be making his comeback and, so, one match-winner definitely returns to the XI.         
	Sehwag and Yuvraj hadnt been available for the recent Champions Trophy and their absence contributed to India not making even the semi-final. The tournament was won by Ricky Pontings Australia.         
	That success allowed Australia to stay No.1, but the top positions have, in the past month-and-a-half in particular, seen so many changes that one has lost count. Not that rankings really matter much.         
	Form is the key factor and while T20 is different to the 50-over game, the Board of Control for Cricket in India did Australia a big favour by giving its blessings to the Champions League at a time which allowed the Brett Lees to get acclimatised for the forthcoming engagements.         
	Dhoni had to play it safe when a Champions League-related question was asked.         
	Incidentally, while its a day match, overnight dew may still be a factor. Well have to wait and watch, Dhoni said.         
	The wait-and-watch bit would also apply to just how well the seven ODIs are received by the fans who pass the turnstiles. Where the future of the 50-over game is concerned (in India, at least), that will be answered by the public... Well know at the end of the series, Dhoni pointed out.         
	State chief minister Narendra Modi, who is the new president of the Gujarat Cricket Association, is expected to watch a part of the match.         
	Match starts: 9 am.

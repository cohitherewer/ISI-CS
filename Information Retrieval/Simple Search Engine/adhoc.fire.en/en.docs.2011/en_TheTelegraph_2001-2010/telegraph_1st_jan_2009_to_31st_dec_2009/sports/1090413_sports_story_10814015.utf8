The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clark comes in for Geeves
                                                   Clark comes in for Geeves
                      
	Melbourne: Speedster Stuart Clark has been asked to join the Australian squad for the ongoing ODI series against South Africa as a replacement for the injured pacer Brett Geeves.         
	Clark, who has not played international cricket for quite sometime now and has missed all the six Tests against South Africa due to an elbow injury, will arrive in Port Elizabeth on Monday before the fourth ODI against the Proteas. However, its unlikely that the 33-year-old Clark will play in Mondays match.         
	South Africa are up 2-1 against the World Champions in the ongoing series, after they crushed the visitors by 25 runs in the third one-dayer on Friday.         
	Trailing 1-2 in the five-match one-day series, Australia are struggling to beat South Africa in their own den, and coach Tim Nielsen feels his wards are being intimidated by the noisy South African fans.         
	In order to combat the problem, the coach has called on his less-experienced players to try and keep calm and think things through a little more. We just need to try not to let the emotion of the game and crowd and everything else going on get to us too much... Nielsen was quoted as saying by an Australian newspaper. Its a challenge for the young guys in that situation to try to think what they want to bowl without panicking and getting too keen to do it well, he added.         
	Commenting on the third one-dayer, Nielsen urged his wards to emulate the way the Proteas handled the crowd and the situation. South Africa are very experienced. The way Kallis and De Villiers played (adding 114 runs for the third wicket in Thursdays 25-run win), they werent necessarily slow, but they never once panicked, he said.

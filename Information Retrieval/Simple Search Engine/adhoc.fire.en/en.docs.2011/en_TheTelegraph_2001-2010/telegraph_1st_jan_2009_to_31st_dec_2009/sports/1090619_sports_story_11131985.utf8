                                                   Knight Riders finally make it official
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Its official. The Kolkata Knight Riders on Thursday formally announced their decision to sack head of cricket operations John Buchanan, claiming the parting of ways had been amicable.         
	Co-owner Jay Mehta said in a statement that the former Australia coach has been released with immediate effect.         
	(John) Buchanan has informed Knight Riders that despite his hard work over the past two seasons, he has not achieved everything he set out to and has not been able take the franchise into the future as per his vision for this team. We have amicably agreed that Knight Riders will release him from his contract with immediate effect, Mehta said.         
	I would like to state that John is a great coach. He had a vision for the Knight Riders and did not waver from this vision. Unfortunately, it has not brought the results that are so necessary to this franchise. The Knight Riders would like to wish him every success in his future wherever that may take him, Mehta added.         
	The Knight Riders management also announced a fresh approach for the 2010 season.         
	While the 2009 IPL season was an exciting and successful event, the Knight Riders regretfully did not achieve what was required of them during the tournament, failing to fulfil both their own and their fans expectations.         
	The Knight Riders management and owners have reviewed the strengths and weaknesses of the team with all parties involved and are proactively looking for a new approach to ensure the Knight Riders are well prepared for the 2010 season of IPL and beyond. As a part of this exercise, Knight Riders have consulted with John to discuss a new approach.         
	John, however, feels that his vision and direction for the team that he wishes to take are no longer aligned to those of the owners and franchise management, and as such he has decided to return to his coaching and corporate consulting work through his company, Buchanan Success Coaching, the franchise said in a statement.         
	Buchanan, on his part, said his thoughts werent aligning with the team management and he was very disappointed at not being able to continue with the Knight Riders and complete the work started some 18 months back.

                                                   Shane Warne amp; Co. crush the Royal Challengers
                            
	Pretoria: Pacer Amit Singh and left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadejas sensational bowling set the tone as the Rajasthan Royals thrashed the Royal Challengers Bangalore by seven wickets for their third straight win in the Indian Premier League Thursday.         
	Chasing a modest 106, the defending champions romped home with five overs to spare after Naman Ojha (52) struck a second successive unbeaten half-century.         
	Amit and Jadeja shared seven wickets between them to wreck the Royal Challengers Bangalore after the Rajasthan Royals captain Shane Warne invited them to bat.         
	Amit, who made a sensational IPL debut against the Kings XI Punjab with figures of 3/9, improved to a four for 19 Thursday. Jadeja was equally devastating with figures of 3 for 15.         
	Rajasthan Royals scoring was not as brisk after last-match hero Graeme Smith (20) was dismissed early but they didnt have to toil too hard either.         
	Bangalore Royal Challengers bowled too many wide deliveries for a side defending such a low total.         
	Ojha, who starred with a blazing 68-run knock in the last match against the Kings XI Punjab, once again did well for a 38-ball knock that comprised three fours and an equal number of sixes.         
	Comfortably placed at 62 for two before the strategy break, Yusuf Pathan and Ojha guided the team to victory, sharing a 43-run stand.         
	Yusuf was sent back by Dillon du Preez with the Rajasthan Royals needing just 15 runs for the win. His knock of 22 was studded with two fours.         
	But Ojha made sure that there were no further hiccups and smashed a six and a four off the last two balls of a Praveen Kumar over to complete the formalities.         
	Earlier, the Royal Challengers Bangalores top-order let them down badly and half the side was back in the dug-out by the 12th over for just 52. The team took more than 19 overs to complete the 100.         
	Anil Kumbles men couldnt have imagined a worse start as opener Wasim Jaffer (8) departed in the third over with the team score reading 10. Amit made up for a dropped catch in the previous over when he had Jaffer caught at short cover by Lee Carseldine.         
	The next blow for the Royal Challengers Bangalore came in the fifth over when in-form all-rounder Jacques Kallis (10) top-edged a Munaf Patel ball which Niraj Patel collected at deep backward square.         
	Rahul Dravid went for a duck while Robin Uthappa (17) too departed without making any substantial contribution as the Royal Challengers Bangalore stuttered to 49 for 4 before the strategy break.         
	Uthappa was Jadejas first victim, trapped leg before by the left-armer.         
	The Royal Challengers Bangalores slump continued after the break as well with wicket-keeper Mark Boucher (6) departing in the 11th over. Boucher was castled by Jadeja, edging one on to the stumps to leave them reeling at 52 for five.         
	Jadeja struck again in the 15th over when Morne Morkel took a sharp catch at the third man to dismiss Virat Kohli (15), who was just beginning to settle.         
	Roelof van der Merwe contributed 15 before being clean bowled by Amit. The pacer then cleaned up the Royal Challengers Bangalore tail with ease to complete another spectacular performance.         
	Rajasthan Royals next play Chennai Super Kings on Saturday in Kimberly.           (PTI)

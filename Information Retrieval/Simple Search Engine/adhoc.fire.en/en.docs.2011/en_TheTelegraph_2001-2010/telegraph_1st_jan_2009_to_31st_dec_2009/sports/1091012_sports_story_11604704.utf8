The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tsonga outguns Youzhny
                                                   Tsonga outguns Youzhny
                      
	Tokyo: Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga outgunned Russias Mikhail Youzhny 6-3, 6-3 to win the Japan Open with a dazzling mix of guile and brute force on Sunday.         
	The world No. 7 and tournament second seed took 69 minutes to blow Youzhny off court and capture his third title of the year and fifth of his career.         
	I will celebrate in the plane to Shanghai with a beer and maybe a little dance, Tsonga told reporters with a huge grin. I played perfectly today, like I did yesterday.         
	When I play like that its tough for my opponents, added Tsonga, who won his semi-final against compatriot Gael Monfils by the same scoreline on Saturday.         
	Tsonga broke through in the eighth game of the first set, forcing Youzhny to smack a forehand wide and the Frenchman took the set with a 201 kmph ace into the corner.         
	Another fierce forehand pressured Youzhny into netting a backhand to give Tsonga the crucial break for a 4-3 lead in the second.         
	The Russian had a sniff of an opportunity at deuce in the next game but Tsonga ruthlessly slammed the door with two of his 11 aces, the first on a second serve.         
	Tsonga chased down a Youzhny drop shot, dinking the ball cross court to bring up match point, which he converted with a high volley off a clever sliced approach into the corner. He celebrated by climbing into the players box to hug his entourage as a packed Tokyo crowd bathed in sunshine after a week of typhoon rain roared in appreciation.

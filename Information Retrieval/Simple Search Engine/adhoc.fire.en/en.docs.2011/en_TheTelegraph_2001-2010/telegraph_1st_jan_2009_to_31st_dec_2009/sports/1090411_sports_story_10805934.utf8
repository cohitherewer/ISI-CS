The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Inzy slams PCB over flip-flop
                                                   Inzy slams PCB over flip-flop
                      
	Karachi: Former captain Inzamam-ul Haq flayed the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for its flip-flop with Indian Cricket League (ICL) players, saying that the board has no right to disrespect the players.         
	The Pakistan board should not have announced the list if they were not clear about all aspects of the selection, Inzamam told a cricket website.         
	One day they announced the list, and the next day they reversed it. This is the result of unprofessional thinking by the board and the selectors.         
	If the PCB didnt have an ICC clearance, it had no right to name these players in the list and then tell them after a day that Look, we dont respect you, he said.           (PTI)

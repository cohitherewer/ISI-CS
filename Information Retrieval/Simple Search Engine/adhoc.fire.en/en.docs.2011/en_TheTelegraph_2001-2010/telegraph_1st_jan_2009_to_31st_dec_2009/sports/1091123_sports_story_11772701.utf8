                                                                                                                       7                                      Kapur ends tied third, retains card
                      
	Siem Reap: Shiv Kapur retained full playing rights on the Asian Tour for the next season but missed the title as he overcame a topsy-turvy day to sign off tied third at the Johnnie Walker Cambodian Open golf tournament Sunday.         
	Currently in 69th position on the Asian Tour Order of Merit, Kapur carded two-under 70 Sunday to end his campaign with a total of seven-under 281, two strokes behind winner Marcus Both of Australia, who carded 67.         
	Three-under after five holes, courtesy birdies on the second, fourth and fifth, Kapurs title hopes were dashed by a double bogey on the seventh as he made the turn at one-under.         
	The backward journey was not as eventful and Kapur picked up a couple of birdies against a lone bogey for a strong finish.         
	One of the goals that I wanted to accomplish coming into this week was to secure my card and I HAVE managed to accomplish that, a relieved Kapur said.         
	I didnt get my win but it was nice to be in contention. Sometimes you just come out short, he added.         
	Since capping his Asian Tour debut with one victory in 2005, Kapur has successfully maintained his full playing rights in Asia.         
	He was ranked 69th on the Asian Tours Order of Merit and needed to be inside the top-65 to maintain his status.         
	Among other Indians, Anirban Lahiri produced his best card of the week  a four-under 68  to finish tied 13th with a total of 284. Vikrant Chopra was a stroke adrift at tied 17th after returning a two-under 70.         
	Further down, Calcutta pro Rahil Gangjee ended tied 38th after signing a card of two-over 74 that left him with a total of one-over 289.         
	Amandeep Johl was at the bottom of the heap after withdrawing midway through the round.           (PTI)

                                                     Dhoni to gamble in must-win match
    - AMIT MISHRA, PRAVEEN KUMAR LIKELY TO PLAY; CLARKES BACK STILL SORE           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni                                 
	Johannesburg: Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the Team India captain, has decided to gamble with five specialist bowlers in the must-win Champions Trophy match against Australia on Monday.         
	While Australia beat the West Indies in their opener on Saturday, India were defeated by Pakistan in their first match. Should India lose, in Centurion, a first-round exit would get scripted.         
	That would be disastrous for the International Cricket Council, too, which is running the tournament. From gate receipts to TV viewership, everything drops if the Indians crash out.         
	Weve got to win, otherwise well have to pack our bags and return home... A number of bowlers had an off day yesterday... The fast bowlers arent looking confident ... Five specialists is a gamble, but Ill be taking it, Dhoni said on Sunday.         
	He reasoned, with justification, that fielding five bowlers wouldnt necessarily add much pressure on the batsmen. If one plays four specialists and they dont do the job (of restricting) then, in any case, there will be plenty of pressure...         
	Asked just how would the fast bowlers be able to lift their confidence overnight, Dhoni replied: Theyre good bowlers ... Theyve delivered in the past ... Its a do or die situation and, in that scenario, the intensity goes up...         
	He clarified that Sachin Tendulkar didnt have a shoulder injury, as such, but wasnt being used as a part-time bowler because the team needed him more as a batsman and he wasnt bowling enough at nets.         
	Dhoni, thankfully, appeared his usual self during the optional nets at the Old Edwardians Sports Club. Despite the optional bit, everybody, except Harbhajan Singh, turned up.         
	I agree Id been a bit low last night (after being defeated by Pakistan), but Im okay now, he told The Telegraph.         
	Earlier, while talking to the media in general, Dhoni said: After a loss, its tough on a captain ... Hes got to be thinking all the time, the bowlers to use, the fields to set ... Options ... It gets draining, but I love challenges and Im up for this one.         
	Where challenges go, Australia, fresh from the 6-1 win in England, will be providing a real big one.         
	The last time that India and Australia played each other in a 50-over match was a year-and-a-half ago, in the tri-series finals. Dhoni and Co. won the best-of-three affair 2-0, but the captain isnt counting on that for much.         
	Its a positive that we won the last time the teams had met, but I dont go by history... That was a long time ago, Dhoni pointed out.         
	The good news for India is that Michael Clarke is almost certain not to take the field. The Australia vice-captain developed soreness in his back at the fag end of the England tour and aggravated it on the journey here.         
	Clarke, in fact, hasnt trained since arriving in South Africa.         
	Meanwhile, according to well-placed sources, all-rounder Yusuf Pathan may make way for leggie Amit Mishra, with Praveen Kumar taking Rudra Pratap Singhs place.         
	That Yusuf is on a shaky wicket became apparent when Dhoni conceded that the elder of the Pathan Brothers wasnt being consistent in ODIs. Hes got the talent, but hasnt been consistent...         
	Match starts: 6 pm (IST).

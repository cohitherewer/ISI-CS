                                                   India win series
                      
	Auckland: Captain Sandeep Singh and veteran Dilip Tirkey found the net twice in the second half to give India a 2-0 victory over New Zealand in the fourth and final hockey Test on Sunday, and also a series win by the same margin.         
	Tirkey and Sandeep scored both the goals from penalty corners after a goalless first-half.         
	After the change of ends, the visitors were impressive on their counter-attacks and exposed the lack of experience of the Black Sticks.         
	Indias efforts soon bore fruit with senior-most player Tirkey opening the scoresheet in the 43rd minute through a powerful drive and then Sandeep followed suit in the 67th minute with a precision perfect drag-flick to the top left of the New Zealand goal.         
	With this win, India pocketed the series 2-0. The visitors earlier won the second Test 2-1, while the first and third Tests were drawn 1-1.           (PTI)

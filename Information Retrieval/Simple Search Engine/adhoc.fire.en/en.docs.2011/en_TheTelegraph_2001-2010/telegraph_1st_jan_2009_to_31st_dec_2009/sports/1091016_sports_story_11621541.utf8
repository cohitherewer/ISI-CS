The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis wants captaincy till 2011 World Cup
                                                     Younis wants captaincy till 2011 World Cup
                  Younis                     
	Karachi: Younis Khan Thursday made it clear to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that he would withdraw his resignation from the captains post only if he is retained at the helm till the 2011 World Cup.         
	Younis, who resigned Tuesday after being grilled about match-fixing charges by the National Assembly standing committee on sports, met PCB chief Ejaz Butt and demanded that if he was to remain captain he would like to have the job till the next World Cup.         
	A top PCB source confirmed that Younis and Butt had a long meeting and the senior batsman, who was being asked by the PCB chief to take back his resignation, made his stand clear.         
	Younis made his position very clear to Butt that he is not taking his resignation back until all his conditions are met by the Board, the most important being appointment as captain on a long-term basis, a PCB source said.         
	He wanted an announcement that he will be made captain until the next World Cup so that some players, who harboured ambitions of replacing him, got down to concentrating on their game, he added.         
	The source disclosed that Younis conveyed his disappointment that the PCB chief preferred to meet vice-captain Shahid Afridi, the manager and the coach separately to discuss the Champions Trophy performance.

                                                   Sourav among runs
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The rotational captaincy on Saturday saw Brendon McCullum and Brad Hodge lead the two sides during the intra-Kolkata Knight Riders match in Bloemfontein. In a close finish, McCullums team won by two runs in a T20 game.         
	According to information received here, batting first, McCullum XI scored 190 for five. Sourav top scored with a half-century. Cheteshwar Pujara scored in the 40s while McCullum contributed in the 30s.         
	In reply, Hodge top scored for his team. He retired after scoring a half-century and then returned to finish in the 70s. Morne van Wyk was dismissed in the 40s.         
	Ajantha Mendis, playing his first match since joining the camp, took a couple of wickets for McCullum XI.         
	Meanwhile, Knight Riders next warm-up match on Tuesday against Free State will not be held as scheduled. Instead, John Buchanan and other members of the support staff have decided to play it on Monday. The opposition is still undecided. It could either be Free State or another intra-Knight Riders match could take place.         
	Sourav had authored an unbeaten 61 for Knight Riders in their last warm-up game, an innings which helped thrash Free State by nine wickets.

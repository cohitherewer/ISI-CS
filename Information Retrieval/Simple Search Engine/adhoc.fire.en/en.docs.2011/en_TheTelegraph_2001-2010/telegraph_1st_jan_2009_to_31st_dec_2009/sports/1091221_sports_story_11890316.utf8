The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India look to do the job without D for company
                                                                                                                       7                                      India look to do the job without D for company
            KUSHAN SARKAR                      
	Cuttack: Indian cricket lovers have had such a high dose of MSD in the last two years that it becomes difficult to accept the reality at times.         
	Therefore, with the captain missing when the Indian players got off the team bus and trooped inside the Barabati Stadium, one thing became evident. Irrespective of the outcome of Mondays encounter the Men in Blue will certainly miss the x-factor that Dhoni brings to the side.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni will miss Thursdays match in Calcutta as well since he has been banned for two matches. An interesting statistic might underline what Dhonis presence means to his band of boys. After he was appointed captain of the ODI team, Dhoni hasnt missed a single one-dayer.         
	As India take on Sri Lanka in a crucial third one day International of the Karbonn Cup, Dhonis absence will be felt like never before.         
	Not only because of his astute leadership but also as someone known to keep his cool under trying circumstances. Add to that, Indias most consistent middle-order batsman in recent times with a career average of over 50.         
	For stand-in captain Virender Sehwag, the responsibility couldnt have come at a more challenging time.         
	The next two matches are sure to decide the course of the series. An unenviable situation to be in for the Nawab of Najafgarh. Those who have seen Sehwag over the years know that he has a habit of taking the bull by the horns. There is no reason to believe it will be any different at the Barabati on Monday. One reassuring fact is that India have won the last two ODIs played here.         
	On the first occasion they beat the West Indies while the second win came against England. The victory against England was a good one for Sehwag who had blasted a 73-ball 91 in the match.         
	Poor fielding is an issue that Sehwag needs to address quickly. Team Indias effort on the field has been sloppy and, in a close match, that might turn out to be decisive.         
	Not least of Indias worries is the presence of a certain Tillekaratne Dilshan who is turning out to be Indias nemesis. It will be interesting to see what strategy the home team devises in order to see Lankas current No.1 batsman back in the hut.         
	But there was a silver lining too. Yuvraj Singh, in all likelihood, will be back to torment the Sri Lanka bowlers. Yuvraj, who sustained a finger injury during the second T20 International in Mohali, batted for around 40 minutes at Sunday afternoons optional net session.         
	The stylish southpaw did not look like being in any discomfort as he played the likes of Pragyan Ojha and Sudeep Tyagi with ease. That Yuvraj had been declared fit before the squad for the third and fourth ODIs were picked in Chennai, on Saturday meant the selectors did not have to name a replacement for the left-hander.         
	If Yuvraj plays, it will be a toss-up between Virat Kohli, who scored 54 in the last game and, Ravindra Jadeja.         
	However, the slow nature of the Cuttack pitch might influence the team think tank to field Jadeja for his handy left-arm spin bowling.         
	Dhonis replacement Dinesh Karthik has a chance to score some useful runs so that he remains in contention as a specialist batsman.         
	Karthiks last outing at this venue had been good; he was adjudged Man of the Match against the West Indies for his innings of 63.         
	Rival captain Kumar Sangakkara, on the other hand, will be worried about Angelo Mathewss replacement.         
	Mathews is a vital cog in the Lanka wheel and his absence might just pave the way for out-of-favour Sanath Jayasuriya to make a comeback although the Lanka captain didnt commit on Mondays playing XI.         
	With evening dew certain to play a role, the toss will be an important factor. As Sehwag pointed out, he would like to bowl first, keeping the dew factor as well as the slow nature of the wicket in mind.         
	Sehwags boys will definitely try and complete a hattrick of wins at the venue and also hope they can celebrate the victory, since the last one had come on 26/11, the night of the terror strikes in Mumbai.

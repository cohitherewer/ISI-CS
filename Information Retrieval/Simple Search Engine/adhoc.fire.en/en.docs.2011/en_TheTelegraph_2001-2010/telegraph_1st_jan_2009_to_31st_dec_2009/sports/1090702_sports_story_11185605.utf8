The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods plays genial host
                                                     Woods plays genial host
            Larry Dorman            Tiger Woods                           
	Shortly after noon Tuesday, about 36 hours before the official start of his third AT amp;T National as tournament host, Tiger Woods was in a playful mood. Seated at the head of a conference table in the upstairs board room at Congressional Country Club, Woods smiled after glancing at Thursdays first-round tee times.         
	Hey, Ive got Lucas, he said, referring to the freshly minted United States Open champion, Lucas Glover. How about that for a great draw? And Charley Hoffman. Perfect. I think maybe Ill have to wear my hat like this.         
	Woods whipped off his cap, grinning as he turned the ends of the brim up until it flattened into Hoffmans trademark surfer-skater-rapper look. Then he spun the hat around backward and leaned into the table to address a few more serious issues.         
	Two weeks after his tie for sixth at Bethpage Black, Woods seemed well over the disappointment of failing to seriously contend in the second consecutive major in which he was the overwhelming pre-tournament favourite. This week brings Woods a real-life perspective to his golf ups and downs, provided by the thousands of servicemen and women who are admitted free and the wounded warriors who participate as honorary starters in the pro-am.         
	We spend the week thanking them for coming out here and being a part of this event, he said, because what they do for our country here and abroad is phenomenal.         
	While he might have been tough to live with during the weeks of fits and starts at Augusta National and on Long Island, Woods has digested the relevant learning and tossed the rest like rinds into the disposal.         
	As a whole, I didnt hit the ball as well as I would have liked at Augusta, and at the Open, I hit it well and I just didnt putt well, he said placidly.           NYT NEWS SERVICE

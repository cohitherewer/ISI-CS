The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis Khan admits dressing room rift
                                                                                                                                     Younis Khan admits dressing room rift
                  Younis Khan                       
	Karachi: Giving an insight into the turmoil in the Pakistan cricket team, Younis Khan Thursday conceded that problems with some senior players along with his poor form were the reasons which forced him to opt out of the Test tour of New Zealand.         
	I was already facing problems with some players and my poor form didnt help as it is a fact that when the captain is not scoring runs it becomes difficult for him to turn things his way, Younis said.         
	No one ever came to me directly and told me his grievances. Otherwise I would have tried to resolve the issues, he said.         
	Younis, who has been replaced as captain by Mohammed Yousuf for the three Tests against New Zealand starting November 24, has taken a break from cricket after Pakistans one-day series loss to the Black Caps. The senior batsman said though he wants to play for Pakistan, he had no idea where his career was heading.         
	Only time will tell what happens and where my career is heading. But I have every intention of wanting to play for Pakistan again, he said. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | NS Manju re-ignites Bagans title dream
                                                     NS Manju re-ignites Bagans title dream
            A STAFF REPORTER            Dempos Sameer Naik (left) clears the ball before Jose Ramirez Barreto could do any damage, at the Barasat Stadium on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: It was late into the injury-time of the second half and the scoreline was reading 1-1. Mohun Bagan had to win this match against Dempo Sports Club to remain in contention for the I-League title and things looked out of their reach. Bagans epitaph was being written by the reporters. They were waiting for referee Rizwan-ul Haque to blow final whistle before sending their reports from their laptops.         
	One Karim Becnharifa, though, was not in a mood to give up. The Mohun Bagan coach  sporting a green T-shirt rather than that customary blue one  turned towards the Barasat Stadium crowd and urged them to egg on his players to extract the last bit from their body and go for the kill.         
	And what happened after that was something to be seen to believe. Rakesh Masihs punt found Jose Ramirez Barreto on the left. The Brazilian, 34-year-old and every sinew tired from all the running and pushing with rival defenders, eluded his marker and sent a measured cross into the Dempo box. The crowd sensed a goal and got up to their feet. N.S. Manju did not disappoint and headed in the dramatic and defining goal. That made it 2-1 for Bagan and sent the I-League to the wire!         
	Manjus unbridled euphoria and a half-Monty in front of the Dempo bench got him an yellow card. But it was not the time to think about what that yellow card meant (Manju became one of the four players who will miss the last match against Mahindra), it was time to celebrate the fact that the green-and-maroon brigade had kept alive their dream of winning the title. That too, in a thrilling way, a dramatic fashion.         
	Earlier, Barreto put his team ahead in the 27th minute. Dempos Beto lost the ball to James Singh on the right. James played it to Marcos Pereira whose forward pass found Barreto inside the box. The Brazilians rasping on-the-run volley crashed into the net leaving the Dempo defence and goalkeeper Abhijit Mondal shell-shocked. It was a classic goal from a top striker.         
	Eulogising this talismanic Brazilian is cliched. As Bencharifa put it: When I first came, I found it very surprising to see if Barreto sends a wrong pass or spurns a chance, nobody reacts. Now, after a season with him, I also dont tell him anything. He is just superb.         
	The equaliser came 10 minutes into the second half. Beto freed Anthony Pereira  who was surpsiringly left unmarked by Deepak Mondal  on the left and Pereiras centre was met with a smart header by Ranty Martins.         
	Post 2004s Cristiano Junior episode during the Federation Cup in Bangalore, Mohun Bagans matches against Dempo have always been tensed and dramatic. Red cards are flashed, players lose their tempers, there are those shoves on the neck and elbows are banged on the face. These two teams refuse to yield an inch every time they square off.         
	Sunday was no different. Eight yellow cards were flashed, Bhaichung Bhutias goal was disallowed in the 34th minute for an infringement on Mahesh Gawli, and there were constant jostling and play-acting. Bhaichungs disallowed goal, in fact, led to violent protests from the Mohun Bagan camp as the referee and the teams were trudging back to the dressing rooms at half-time.         
	Even Dempo coach Armando Colaco was not spared and at the post-match press conference, he claimed to have been pushed by some unknown persons. Dempo, in fact, refused to take the field after the breather and kept the referee and Bagan players waiting for eight minutes. We wanted some assurance from the match commissioner, and I am telling you I was not playing dirty, Colaco said.         
	For the record, this was Bagans third win in as many matches against Dempo this season. The first-leg win started their 10-match winning streak. Will Sundays win give them the title on Thursday? One can never tell.

                                                   South post 442/6 on Day I
                      
	Rajkot: South Zone captain S. Badrinaths maiden double century and Rahul Dravids breezy century helped them pile up 442 for six against North Zone on the first day of the four-day Duleep Trophy semi-final match at the Madhavrao Scindia Stadium here Thursday.         
	Badrinath (200) and Rahul Dravid (138) contributed 312 runs for the third wicket in 57.3 overs after coming together when the team was reeling at two for 13.         
	Of the duo, Dravid was the more aggressive bringing up his hundred in just 127 deliveries with the help of 14 boundaries. Badrinaths century, which was studded with fifteen fours and one six, came in 143 balls.         
	Dravid, who hit a century against Central Zone at Bangalore in the previous game, was in fine nick Thursday and hit all around the ground before he was bowled by spinner Amit Mishra. His innings was studded with eighteen fours. He faced 173 balls, spending 144 minutes on the pitch.         
	Dravid got a reprieve on five when Amit Mishra grounded his catch off medium pacer V.S. Malik, but after that, the former India captain never looked back and pounced on every loose delivery he faced.         
	Brief scores         
	South Zone 442/6 (S. Badrinath 200, R. Dravid 138) vs North Zone. Match to continue. (UNI)

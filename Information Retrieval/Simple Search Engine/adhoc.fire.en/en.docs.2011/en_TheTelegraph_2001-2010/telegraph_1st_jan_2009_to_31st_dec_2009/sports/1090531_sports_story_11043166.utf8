The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Figo hangs up his boots today
                                                   Figo hangs up his boots today
                      
	Rome: Inter Milan midfielder Luis Figo will bring his brilliant career to a close in the Serie A champions season-ending home game against Atalanta on Sunday.         
	Tomorrow, May 31, 2009 will be my last Sunday as a footballer, the Portuguese former World Player of the Year said on the club website.         
	The 36-year-old has won four league titles since joining Inter from Real Madrid in 2005, although he has not been a regular starter in the last two seasons, because of injuries.         
	It pleases me that my last Sunday as a footballer will be a Sunday of festival for the fourth consecutive Serie A title for me and all of us at Inter, he said.         
	He started his career with Sporting, winning the Portuguese Cup in 1995, before his remarkable attacking talents prompted Barcelona to snap him up later that year.         
	He won two league titles and the European Cup Winners Cup with the Catalan club before his controversial move to bitter rivals Real Madrid in 2000 made him the first of the big-money Galacticos signings. He helped the Madrid giants win two league titles and the 2002 Champions League.         
	The player thanked Inter and his friends from Sporting, Barcelona, Real and the Portugal team.         
	He also apologised if his recent form had not been up to scratch. Winning has always been the only real objective of my career, he said. The only way to win I have known is sacrifice and work, which they taught me when I was a lad at Sporting. Thats why today I also want to say sorry if in some matches or in some periods I havent managed to give my all because of injuries or other reasons.

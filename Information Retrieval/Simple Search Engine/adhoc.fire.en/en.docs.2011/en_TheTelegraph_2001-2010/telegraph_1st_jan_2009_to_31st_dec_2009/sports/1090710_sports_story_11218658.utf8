The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cloud over Chennai ATP meet
                                                   Cloud over Chennai ATP meet
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The fate of the Chennai Open hung in the balance after negotiations to renew the deal between the hosts, Tamil Nadu Tennis Association (TNTA), and IMG, the sports management company who hold the original rights for the event, hit a road block.         
	The TNTA had hoped to finalise a fresh arrangement with the IMG in place of its earlier five-year agreement, which ended with the 2009 edition, but talks between the two parties on the sidelines of the Wimbledon in London last week failed, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	The TNTA and IMG were not able to arrive at an agreement on two key issues, the monetary aspect and the player line-up, sources said on Thursday.         
	It is believed that the TNTA wanted IMG to cut down on the earlier value of $1.8 million per year in the light of the global recession while the latter, astonishingly, wanted a 20 per cent increase.         
	While the TNTA felt it had the bargaining power, given the fact that the tournaments in Bangkok and Dubai were pulling out from the ATP Tour from 2011 due to the economic slow down, it was also aware that a sharp cut in finance could also mean that the IMG would hit back by not getting the top-10 players. And that exactly is how the script seems to have played out.         
	But with a consortium of sponsors headed by the state government itself to back them, TNTA are confident of retaining the $440,000 prize money event. In fact, they were looking at the prospect of owning their own week  the ATP and WTA Tours have sold each week on their calendars, and venues like Chennai hold tournaments after entering into a contract with the rights holders of the particular week.         
	We have committed sponsors who bring in 60 per cent of the total cost and to fetch the remaining 40 per cent would not be that difficult, a top TNTA official said.         
	This would be a two-year deal (for 2010 and 2011) anyway. We are looking at buying our own week but we are waiting and watching since the ATP Tour is changing its rules from 2012 year onwards.

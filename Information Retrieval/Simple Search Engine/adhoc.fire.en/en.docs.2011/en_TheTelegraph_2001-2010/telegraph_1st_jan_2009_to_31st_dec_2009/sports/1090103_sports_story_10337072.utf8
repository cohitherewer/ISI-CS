                                                   Terror costs BCCI dear
                      
	Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has incurred a loss to the tune of Rs 120 crore this fiscal year mainly due to the November 26 terror strikes.         
	BCCI has incurred a loss of Rs 120 crore due to the cancellation of the Pakistan tour, Champions League that was to be held in the month of December and the two one-day matches against England due to the terror attacks, a BCCI source said Friday.         
	Novembers terror attacks resulted in losses for the BCCI as the Englishmen returned home, though the team came back later for the Test series.         
	India were leading 5-0 in the seven match one-day series but the last two one-dayers in Delhi and Guwahati could not be played.         
	The $6 million Champions League was scheduled to be played between December 3-10 in three centres Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore.         
	The BCCI source said that in a bid to compensate for the losses, the Board may ask New Zealand to accommodate an additional Test match during Indias tour in March-April this year.         
	Apart from that, the BCCI was exploring the possibility of arranging a short series to make up for its cancelled tour of Pakistan in the wake of the Mumbai terror attacks.

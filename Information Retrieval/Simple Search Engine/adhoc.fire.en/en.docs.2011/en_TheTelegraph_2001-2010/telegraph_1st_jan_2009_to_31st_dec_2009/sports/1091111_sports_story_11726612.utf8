The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hoping tours last tie doesnt end in a sigh
                                                                                                                                   Hoping tours last tie doesnt end in a sigh

	Mumbai: Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men have yet to see the Aussies off but those up next, the Sri Lankans, are already in town and warming up in full zest. That the series against the Ricky Pontings is all but over and that despite it being so they cannot yet look ahead would make it that much harder for the Indians to focus on Wednesdays inconsequential, last ODI.         
	As if to make things worse for the hosts, unseasonal rain forced their match-eve practice to be cancelled. Blame it on global warming or what you will, heavy rain has been forecast for matchday and it could end up being a case of damp finish to a forgettable series for the Indians.         
	How much it influences the behaviour of the pitch remains to be seen. The Indian batsmen, especially Virender Sehwag, would be praying the heavens dont conspire against them as they attempt to regain some lost sheen.         
	The Australians, however, would be all charged up to wind off on a winning note. They have won three matches in a row now, making it 15 wins from the last 19 matches.         
	At one stage on this tour, the Australian dressing room must have worn the look of an emergency ward with players forced out of action with injuries and others coming in to replace them. Yet, the men from Down Under have managed what other full-strength teams havent been able to.         
	Australia would be without Shane Watson and Mitchell Johnson who flew back home Tuesday night, but their absence, given the way the youngsters have risen to the occasion, is unlikely to bring any creases to Pontings forehead.         
	And the manner of their success has once again proved two things  that a team needs to have a strong pace attack, not mystery spinners, to beat India in India and that, in slightly helpful conditions, Indian batsmen are vulnerable to seam bowling, as highlighted by their capitulation in Guwahati.         
	Dhoni might have been encouraged to bat that morning following the valiant chase in Hyderabad, but a more astute captain would have taken into consideration the flop show in Mohali, which can well be regarded as the turning point in the series.         
	Fielding, the aspect of the game that usually reflects the overall standard of a team, has been another area of concern. In contrast, again, the Australians have been on top of their game in this department. Incidentally, the Aussies have employed a baseball specialist to help improve their fielding and throwing.         
	Another thing that has set the two teams apart is bench strength. Whereas the likes of Doug Bollinger have stepped up, to fill in for the injured Brett Lee, the Indians have had to rely on the vast experience of Sachin Tendulkar.         
	Match starts: 2.30pm

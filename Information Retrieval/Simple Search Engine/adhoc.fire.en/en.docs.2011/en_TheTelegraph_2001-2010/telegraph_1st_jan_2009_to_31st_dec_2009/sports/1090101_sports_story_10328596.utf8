The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Premjit Lall is no more
                                                     Premjit Lall is no more
            A STAFF REPORTER            Premjit Lall                           
	Calcutta: India on Wednesday lost one of her tennis icons  Premjit Lall  who during the 1960s took the game to a new level. His peers, Akhtar Ali and Jaidip Mukerjea, who saw him scale new heights on both the international and national circuits, termed his death a great loss.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Akhtar Ali: Its very sad  We three (myself, Jaidip and Premjit) have been very close We were just like brothers. We were known as the three musketeers He was not only a good-looking man, but was a fine gentleman too. I never found anybody complaining about him. And in 1964 it was under his captaincy that I had played my last Davis Cup against Pakistan in Lahore. Some people objected when he (Premjit) named me in place of Jaidip who was injured He straightaway rejected them and told me to go on The rest is history We beat Pakistan 5-0. But his match against Rod Laver was memorable He fought like a soldier and at one stage he was leading 2-0 I remember that was a terrific match. Even Laver in his biography said that he was lucky to win the match         
	Naresh Kumar: Its terrible news He was a very good player indeed and a wonderful fellow I think he was the stalwart of Indian tennis I had always said that he had the looks of a matinee-idol I have seen hysterical schoolgirls falling for him I still remember that match against the great Rod Laver Though he eventually lost, the way he played was amazing. But I think life was never kind to him I feel we were lucky to see him a few weeks back and found him quite fine He was lucid He was recounting the old matches and also enquired about our children I am really shocked         
	Jaidip Mukerjea: We started our careers together at the South Club We used to travel together for 8-9 months together We (myself, Akhtar and Premjit) were great friends and really had a great time together But I would like to point out that he was the most underestimated player in the country He was a very good partner and I had some great moments during the 1962 Australian Open and the 1973 Wimbledon Championships. We reached the last eight stage and were really going great guns I have lost a very good friend and this loss will definitely create a void.

                                                   Aryadaha cleared
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The CAB on Wednesday decided to allow Aryadaha Club to attend Fridays annual general meeting.         
	This was after Tushar Sarkar, the only representative of Aryadaha present at Wednesdays hearing, tendered an unconditional apology for the mistake in their papers.         
	Sultan Ahmed, who was also summoned by the CAB, was absent at the hearing.         
	We dont want any further controversy. Sarkar tendered an unconditional apology after admitting the mistake in the papers. The president has the power to allow them and Jagmohan Dalmiya permitted them to attend the AGM, joint secretary Biswarup Dey said.         
	Incidentally, Sultan will represent Aryadaha at the AGM while Sarkar is scheduled to be present at the working committee.

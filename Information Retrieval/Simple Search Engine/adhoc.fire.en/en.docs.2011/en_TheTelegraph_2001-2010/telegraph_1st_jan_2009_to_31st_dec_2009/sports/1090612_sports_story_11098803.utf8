	Nottingham: Aaron Redmond made a blistering 63 on his international Twenty20 debut, as New Zealand beat Ireland by 83 runs in their World Cup Super Eight game on Thursday.         
	Redmond, who previously had a reputation as a defensive batsman, reached his half-century off 23 balls and struck 13 boundaries from just 30 deliveries.         
	Scott Styris smashed 42 from 25 balls and Martin Guptil anchored the innings with an unbeaten 45 as New Zealand scored 198 for five. New Zealand ran out four Irish batsmen and Nathan McCallum took three wickets as Ireland were simply outclassed. Redmond was only playing due to a spate of injuries in the New Zealand camp.         
	On Thursday he was named as a permanent replacement for Jesse Ryder, who is out of the tournament with an abdominal illness.         
	Regular captain Daniel Vettori failed to recover from a shoulder injury, forcing Brendon McCullum to stand-in, while Ross Taylor rested a hamstring strain.         
	This mini-crisis didnt seem to have any obvious effect on the Black Caps, who hit 32 from their first two overs and reached 50 from 28 balls.         
	One run later McCullum chipped an easy catch to Regan West off McCallan at mid-off.         
	Redmond was finally out lbw to Alex Cusack, but Styris and Martin Guptil put on 61 for the third wicket before the former was the victim of a tremendous diving catch by Kevin Brien off McCallan.         
	As New Zealand chased quick runs, Jacob Oram was caught by Andre Botha off Cusack for 15 and Trent Johnston bowled Peter McGlashan.         
	Ireland made a luckless start to the run chase, losing William Porterfield in the first over.         
	The Ireland captain was run out after the bowler, Kyle Mills, got his fingertips to a drive by Gary Wilson and deflected the ball onto the stumps.         
	Wilson was then dropped by Ian Butler at mid-on, but Niall Brien went in the third over, caught by Oram at mid-off off Mills.         
	Ireland were unable to score fast enough to threaten the New Zealand total.         
	Styris had Wilson caught by James Franklin for 28 and then ran out Andre Botha, before Kevin Brien was caught by Franklin off Nathan McCullum.

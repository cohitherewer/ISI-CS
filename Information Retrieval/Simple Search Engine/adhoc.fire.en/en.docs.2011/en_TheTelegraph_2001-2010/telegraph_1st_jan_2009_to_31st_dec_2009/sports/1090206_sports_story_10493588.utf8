    - Gambhir highest individual scorer in Lanka

	Colombo: India created history Thursday, recording their ninth one-day win on the trot when they thrashed Sri Lanka by 67 runs in the inconsequential fourth ODI here, riding Gautam Gambhirs career-best 150-run knock.         
	The Indian victory also spoiled Muttiah Muralidharans party as the Sri Lankan spin wizard became the highest wicket-taker in one-day cricket.         
	Apart from Gambhirs scintillating knock, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni scored 94 to propel India to an imposing 332 for five, after winning the fourth successive toss. The visitors then skittled out the hosts for 265 in 48 overs to take a 4-0 lead in the five-match series. Kumar Sangakkara played a defiant innings of 56 from one end but perished in an attempt to accelerate.         
	Indian spinners, led by Pragyan Ojha, bowled in tandem and played an important role in keeping the Sri Lankan scoring rate quite low.         
	Irfan Pathan, playing his first match in the series, was the most successful bowler with three wickets while Virender Sehwag and Praveen Kumar took two wickets apiece. The last match of the series will be played on Sunday at the Sinhalese Sports Club and the brief tour will come to an end on February 10 with a twenty20 match.         
	Sanath Jayasuriya and Tillekeratne Dilshan had provided the hosts with a fiery start, racing away to 50 in just 43 balls. However, neither of the two could build on their good starts. The Sri Lankans lost wickets at regular intervals which only helped the Indian cause.         
	The left-handed Jayasuriya looked in sublime touch as he took the comeback man Irfan Pathan for some special treatment, hitting him for a four and a six in the sixth over. Jayasuriya welcomed the left-armer with a powerful flat six off his first ball in the eighth over but the Indian had the last laugh, dismissing the southpaw off the next ball. Pathan pitched one short and Jayasuriya, while attempting a big one, miscued the shot. Rohit Sharma, at short extra cover, took a smart catch.         
	Sangakkara joined Dilshan in the middle but pacer Praveen Kumar did not let the pair settle down as he dismissed the latter when he had him caught by Yuvraj Singh.         
	Jayawardene forged a 61-run stand with Sangakkara to revive the innings but the scoring rate was no where near to what was required. At the halfway mark, Sri Lanka had not even reached 150 and then Sehwag dealt a severe blow to the hosts when he dismissed Jayawardene. He failed to negotiate a sharply turning ball and edged it towards Dhoni, who, on his second attempt, caught the ball. Yusuf Pathan then trapped Thilina Kandamby inf front and when Sangakkara departed, the writing was on the wall.         
	Thanks to some late fireworks by Nuwan Kulasekara, who shared a 45-run stand with Dilhara Fernando for the last wicket, that Sri Lanka could cross the 250-run mark.         
	Earlier, the visitors, who had gone into the match with the series in their pocket, relied on Gambhir and Dhonis record 188-run second-wicket partnership to get to a competitive total.         
	The 27-year-old Gambhir notched up his sixth ODI century and his third against Sri Lanka. He also became the highest individual scorer in a one-dayer in Sri Lanka, eclipsing the previous best of 145, jointly held by Sri Lankas Aravinda de Silva and Zimbabwes Andy Flower.         
	Despite being on the backfoot for the most part of the innings, spin legend Muttiah Muralitharan had something to cheer about in the fag end when he broke Wasim Akrams world record of highest one-day scalps.         
	Muralidharan dismissed Gambhir to take his one-day tally to 503 in his 328th match. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis Khan: The 2003 loss to India still hurts
                                                   Younis Khan: The 2003 loss to India still hurts
                      
	Johannesburg: Six years have passed since their humiliating loss to India in the World Cup in South Africa, but Pakistan captain Younis Khan says the defeat still hurts and his team would be eyeing revenge when the two sides clash in the Champions Trophy on September 26.         
	In the 2003 World Cup match, Pakistan lost the match despite putting up a competitive 273, owing mainly to a scintillating innings by Sachin Tendulkar.         
	It hurts. I played that match. We scored more than 270, and still lost. A score of 250 in these conditions is considered safe. But the way Sachin and (Virender) Sehwag batted, backed by Rahul Dravid and Yuvraj Singh, we lay beaten. That defeat still hurts, Younis said Saturday         
	Younis said he wished there were more matches between the two sides.         
	If you get beaten, its a long wait before getting even. It keeps hurting you, he quipped.         
	Younis fractured his little finger here during nets Friday, but played down the injury scare.         
	Its a small fracture, nothing serious. Well assess it on Monday. Hopefully, itll be alright, he said.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Newcastle win 3-1
                                                   Newcastle win 3-1
                                  
	London: Newcastle United grabbed a Premier League lifeline on Monday when late goals by substitutes Obafemi Martins and Peter Lovenkrands secured a 3-1 home win over fellow relegation strugglers Middlesbrough.         
	The victory in a tense Northeast clash, Newcastles first win at home in 2009, edged them out of the relegation zone on 34 points, above Hull City on goal difference.         
	Middlesbrough, who have lost 11 successive away league games, look destined to go down as they remain second-last on 31 points. West Bromwich Albion also have 31 and the four teams have two games remaining. Newcastles last two games are at home to Fulham and away to Aston Villa while Middlesbrough host Villa before finishing at West Ham United.

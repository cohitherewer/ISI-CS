                                                                                                                       7                                      Sachin rested for tri-series
    - Ishant dropped, Rohit back Dinda in squad           A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar has opted out of the tri-series in Bangladesh, starting on January 4, while Bengal pacer Ashok Dinda has been included in the 16-member squad.         
	Rohit Sharma has made a comeback while Ishant Sharma and Praveen Kumar have been dropped.         
	Yuvraj Singh has also been included, despite a finger injury that kept him out of the four ODIs in the five-match series against Sri Lanka.         
	Temperamental speedster Sreesanth, who missed the ODI series against Sri Lanka because of swine flu, also made his way back.         
	Left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha was also left out of the Bangladesh one-day squad with the national selectors preferring leg-spinner Amit Mishra for the second specialist spinners role.         
	Dinda, who made his Twenty20 debut for India earlier this month, was included after a selection committee meeting in New Delhi on Friday evening, BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan informed in a media release.         
	Ishant, who has been in poor form in recent times, was not only axed from the tri-series squad but was also not included in the side for the fifth and final ODI against Sri Lanka on Sunday.         
	Sachin Tendulkar desired to be rested for the tri-series at Bangladesh.         
	He will play the Tests against Bangladesh, Srinivasan said in the release.         
	Rookie Sudeep Tyagi, a member of the current ODI squad, has kept his place despite not playing a game. Dinesh Karthik has been named as the second wicketkeeper in the squad.         
	Virender Sehwag, who led India when Mahendra Singh Dhoni was unavailable following the two-match suspension for slow over-rate, has been named vice-captain for the tri-series.         
	The 22-year-old Rohit was dropped from the ODI squad after an extended run of disappointing scores in limited-overs cricket.         
	He last played in the West Indies in July and was pushed aside by Virat Kohli in the batting line-up.         
	Kohli grabbed his chances with both hands, scoring half-centuries in the Champions Trophy and against Sri Lanka before hitting his maiden century to seal the series win against Sri Lanka in the fourth one-dayer at Eden Gardens on Thursday.         
	Rohit paved his way back through a triple-century in the last round of Ranji Trophy league matches.         
	Ishant, who was dropped for the first two ODIs against Sri Lanka, failed to impress on his return for the latter half of the series.         
	He managed just two wickets in two matches at an average of 65.00 and an economy rate of 9.28.         
	Before that, during the series against Australia at home, he managed five wickets in four matches at 30.00 each. Praveen, who played the first two matches of the Sri Lanka series, managed just one wicket and went at 6.76 runs per over.         
	Apart from India, hosts Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are the other teams.         
	India play their first match in Bangladesh in Dhaka on January 5, against Sri Lanka, followed by fixtures on January 7, 10 and 11. The final of the tri-series is on January 13.         
	The tri-series will be followed by a two-match Test series in Chittagong (January 17-21) and Dhaka (January 24-28).         
	In the absence of Tendulkar, Gautam Gambhir is likely to open the innings with Delhi teammate Sehwag while it will be interesting to see who bats at the crucial No.3 position.         
	Zaheer Khan will spearhead the pace attack which also has Ashish Nehra and Sreesanth besides the two rookies Tyagi and Dinda.         
	The selectors also named the squad for the final one-dayer against Sri Lanka to be played at the Kotla on Sunday.         
	Dhoni, who missed the last two matches due to a ban over slow over-rates, is back while Dinda comes in for Ishant. Sreesanth has also been included.

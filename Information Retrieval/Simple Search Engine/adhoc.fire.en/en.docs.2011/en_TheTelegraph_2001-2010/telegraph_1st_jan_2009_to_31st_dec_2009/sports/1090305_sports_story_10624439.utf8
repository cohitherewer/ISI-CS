The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tim May concerned over IPL security
                                                   Tim May concerned over IPL security
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Tim May, chief executive of the Federation of International Cricketers Association, has written to the Indian Premier League (IPL) organisers expressing his concern over the event and demanding involvement of player representatives in security assessment in the wake of the Lahore terror attack.         
	We have written to the IPL on behalf of our members requesting an ability for player representatives to be involved in the evaluation and construction of security for the event, May said on Wednesday.         
	He added that a number of players have expressed concern over travelling to India for the IPL and would like an independent security assessment prior to the tournament.         
	An increasing number of players have expressed a desire for an independent level of comfort surrounding security arrangements for this event, he said.         
	May said he has had a meeting with ICC officials last week wherein he had raised a number of security concerns following a survey conducted into player safety.         
	At this time, its not appropriate to go into the detail of either the survey or the meeting. But there was a general acceptance that cricket needs to construct firm processes, involving both players and administrators, to address any effects on cricket that an escalation of terrorism may have, May said.         
	The 47-year-old former Australia all-rounder pledged his support for the creation of a security summit to find ways to nullify the security threat to players.         
	We owe to it the game and all of its stakeholders to ensure that at all times cricket has access to the best security. We should leave no stone unturned in the search and implementation of such advice and procedures, he said.         
	May, meanwhile, condemned the Lahore terror attack on the Sri Lankan cricketers.         
	Our thoughts and prayers are with not only the Sri Lankan players, officials and security personnel that were subjected to such an attack, but also to the cricket loving people of Pakistan. It is a significant blow to cricket within Pakistan and of concern to the international cricketing community.         
	Over the years, Australia, South Africa and England have been the most sceptical sides when about their security in the subcontinent.         
	Australia and England, along with the West Indies, had declined to play in Sri Lanka during the 1996 World Cup, citing lack of security.         
	The island nation was going through a tempestuous period at that point of time because of the LTTEs activities.         
	India and Pakistan, co-hosts of that World Cup, sent a combined team to play Sri Lanka ahead of the World Cup to show their solidarity.         
	Australia have also not toured Pakistan for a long time citing security reasons.

	Melbourne: Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray dominated their third-round matches at the Australian Open on Saturday, moving closer to a possible semi-final showdown.         
	Top-ranked Nadal did have some work hard against Germanys Tommy Haas, getting broken for the first time in the tournament, but showed no weakness in ripping 53 winners to only eight unforced errors in a 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 victory.         
	I think I played one of my best matches here at the Australian Open, said Nadal, making his fifth appearance at Melbourne Park.         
	He will next face 13th-seeded Fernando Gonzalez of Chile, who beat Nadal in straight sets en route to finishing as the runner-up here in 2007. The 28-year-old Chilean needed more than four hours to beat Frances Richard Gasquet with a 12-10 fifth set.         
	The fourth-seeded Murray, seeking his first Grand Slam title, ran off 11 straight games while overwhelming Jurgen Melzer 7-5, 6-0, 6-3.         
	Serena Williams wasnt her sharpest, but she hasnt had to be so far. And there were no distractions as she beat overmatched Chinas Peng Shuai 6-1, 6-4. Serena overcame two service breaks in the second set to keep alive her pursuit of a 10th Grand Slam title.         
	Nadal said theres no such thing as a perfect match, but he wasnt far away.         
	With Haas playing at the top of his game, Nadal fell behind 0-2 in the first set, then never faced another breakpoint. He lost only 13 points in 12 service games and committed only one unforced error in the 43-minute second set and two in the third.         
	The crowd favourite for Murrays match was clear, with Scottish flags and tartan hats scattered about on a cool night. Constantly confounded by Murrays blend of power, speed and spin, Melzer did get a huge ovation when he held while down 0-3 in the third set to end Murrays streak of 11 games.         
	Melzer broke as Murray served for the match at 5-1 and fended off double match point in the next game. But Murray finished it off with his eighth ace, getting one step closer to becoming the first British man to win a major since 1936.         
	Murray has raced through his first three matches in a combined four hours and 15 minutes  just six minutes longer than Gonzalez and Gasquet were on court Saturday  thanks in part to a 45-minute effort when Andrei Pavel retired in the first round with a bad back.         
	With fans screaming after every point like a Davis Cup match, Gonzalez saved a match point in the third-set tie-breaker, then a break point in the 21st game of the fifth set. The Beijing Olympics silver medallist broke Gasquet in the next, setting up match point with a perfect lob and clinching it with a backhand winner.         
	The mood had seemed almost subdued as play got underway at Melbourne Park, a day after a violent clash between Serbian and Bosnian fans kept security guards busy. A chair-flinging skirmish after defending champion Novak Djokovic of Serbia beat Bosnian-born American Amer Delic left a woman injured, three men charged with riotous behaviour and 30 people ejected by police.         
	Serena became increasingly frustrated against Peng as she was broken twice early in the second before pulling herself together. I started making more errors and then I lost my serve a couple times, she said. Then I think I put too much pressure on myself. Then, next thing I know, I was down.         
	Luckily for Serena, thats not necessarily a bad thing. I was like, You know, Serena, sometimes you just play better when youre down. I started playing better.         
	Serena next faces No. 13 Victoria Azarenka of Belarus, who ousted 2006 Australian Open and Wimbledon champion Amelie Mauresmo.         
	Olympic gold medalist Elena Dementieva extended her winning streak to 13 matches, beating Australias Samantha Stosur.         
	No. 14 Fernando Verdasco of Spain beat No. 22 Radek Stepanek to advance along with three Frenchmen Saturday.         
	Among them was fifth-seeded Jo-Wilfried Tsonga who beat Israeli Dudi Sela and next meets No. 9 James Blake, who became the second American to reach the final 16, joining Andy Roddick.

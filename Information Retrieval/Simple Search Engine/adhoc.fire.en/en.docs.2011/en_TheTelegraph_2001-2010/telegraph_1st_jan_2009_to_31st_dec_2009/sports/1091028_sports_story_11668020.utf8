                                                     More pressure on our batsmen: Tim Nielsen
  - Australia coach says Lee certain to miss Nagpur ODI but doesnt rule Johnson out       OUR CORRESPONDENT          Ricky Ponting during a practice session at the VCA Stadium in Nagpur on Tuesday. (PTI)                                 
	Nagpur: Ricky Ponting may have given vent to his displeasure about the timing of the Champions League T20 but Tim Nielsen played it safe on Tuesday. The Australia coach clearly wanted to avoid any controversy.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	The injuries ahead of the second ODI         
	Brett (Lee) is certainly out of tomorrow (Wednesday)s game but Mitchell Johnsons woken up a lot better today (Tuesday) morning than we thought he would be when we drafted him in the media release last evening. So its really pleasing to see him get up today and shine We will see how he pulls up through the training session and all the indications are that he might well be available Wednesday morning.         
	The sides inexperience         
	We certainly are an inexperienced lot. If Mitchell and Brett cant play then we are losing about 300 matches in ODIs in terms of their experience. And we are talking about six or seven (games) between Ben Hilfenhaus and Doug Bollinger So that is one of the issues James Hopes has played 60 or 70 games as well and 350 games out is quite a bit. Having said that, the only way the young players learn or get better is from being exposed to battle.         
	The XI for Wednesday         
	At this stage Mitchell is not completely out, Brett is probably out for one (match) and we expect Hopes to probably miss the next two games. It is part and parcel of the game. You know Bollinger got five wickets against Pakistan. Hilfenhaus is learning about one day cricket all the time. Shaun Marsh is waiting for a big opportunity. Nathan Hauritz is getting better and better. Peter Siddle is now given an opportunity to lead the attack. It helps develop the teams depth.         
	The team composition         
	The pressure on our batsmen is a bit more; we need to ensure that our top seven do the majority of the work. Mitchell is important to our side, important for the balance in our side and once we know how he pulled up this afternoon, we will take a call. Probably Marsh will come into the calculations.         
	The batting order if Marsh plays         
	We are comfortable with the role Tim Paine is playing at the top of the order. But these issues, of Shaun probably coming in and the batting slots, we will discuss later.         
	Whether the Champions League T20 had contributed to the injuries         
	It is a situation we grapple with everyday. Bretts played seven one-dayers in England, five in the Champions Trophy and then played the Champions League and it is no surprise that he has got an injury. We need to be careful. But, having said that, when it comes to the Champions League and the IPL, we do need the best players to play these games as it is good for the product. We monitor our bowlers closely. We test them everyday to know how they go physically and mentally...         
	Shane Watsons performance in Vadodara         
	One of those days when he (Watson) couldnt execute his skills as well as he can It was in total contrast to what he did in England and in the Champions Trophy. For the last few months he has been an important bowler. It was a bad day for him But I am sure he will get better.         
	The conditions here         
	Looks like a good wicket. And if there is dew, they will spray the outfield, may be use the super sopper as well during the drinks break. But, yes, it will be a bit more difficult with the dew around, especially for the spinners. The team batting second will probably have difficulty chasing... So the team batting first needs to put up a competitive total.         
	Tackling the Powerplays         
	The Powerplay is important. At the end of the day we need to keep our mindset strong. People feel that they need to hit over the in-field. We are discussing how we are going to play it. It is a work in progress. Yesterday we lost Cameron White in the second ball of the Powerplay. Then we lost a couple of wickets and it affected our chances of a bigger total.         
	Playing the Indian spinners         
	They are quality spinners. We played them pretty well. At two for 105 after 20 overs, we looked well. (For Australia) I think Nathan Hauritz was the stand-out spinner. The issue is that, between overs 26 to 34, the ball gets older it takes the pace off it and it becomes too difficult to score. (Ravindra) Jadeja did a good job, we dont know whether (Amit) Mishra will play here. Hauritz bowled well, it was unfortunate that a catch was dropped off him. At one stage he bowled 5-1-10-0 and that was outstanding. He really applied the brakes in the middle period. He was the bowler of the match for us.         
	Paines role once Brad Haddins back         
	Tims played his role well. Haddin has been injured. Haddin has done well for us in all formats. The thing is that we know that we now have two good wicket-keepers who can compete well.

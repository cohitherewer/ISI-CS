The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Asif fails to meet deadline
                                                   Asif fails to meet deadline
                      
	Islamabad: Pakistan fast bowler Mohammed Asif has failed to meet a deadline to prove he wasnt deported from the United Arab Emirates last year for possessing a small amount of opium.         
	The 26-year-old Asif had previously told a Pakistan Cricket Board inquiry, headed by Wasim Bari, that he left on his own accord after being detained for 19 days in Dubai last June when 0.24 grams of opium were found in his wallet at the airport.         
	However, Bari said Asif had failed to provide documents by the June 1 deadline to prove he wasnt deported.         
	Asif appeared before the committee today but could not give us any proof against deportation, Bari said on Monday. Now, we are going to give our recommendations to the Pakistan Cricket Board.         
	If Asif was deported, he would never be able to return to the UAE, where Pakistan are scheduled to play many of their home matches in the wake of security fears after the Lahore terror attack in March.         
	Bari refused to elaborate on what possible penalty Asif could face.         
	I cant say much on this because we are going to give our recommendations to the PCB and its up to them to decide, Bari said.         
	Asif was banned for a year by the Indian Premier League in September for testing positive for the steroid nandrolone during the tournament. The PCB had initially planned to consider Asif for national selection once his ban is over, but later formed a committee to investigate his UAE detention.

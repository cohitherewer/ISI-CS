                                                   Warne, Gilly wouldve been ideal for T20 Cup: John
                      
	Melbourne: The Kolkata Knight Riders director of cricket operations John Buchanan has advised Australian selectors to request Shane Warne and Adam Gilchrist out of retirement to lead the national team in the World Twenty20 in England.         
	Impressed with the duos performance for the Rajasthan Royals and the Deccan Chargers respectively in the ongoing IPL, feels they should be in the Australian side for the second World Twenty20 to be held in England next month.         
	Buchanan was against risking top Test players with Ashes approaching and suggested either Warne or Gilchrist captained the side. He said Warne, Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden should have been considered, along with specialists such as David Warner, Shane Harwood, Cameron White, Shaun Tait and Moises Henriques.         
	Selectors should have been talking with former players to make themselves available for this particular event. I would be looking at Warne or Gilchrist as captain, he was quoted as saying by a newspaper. If I was a selector, I would not be risking, wherever possible, key Ashes players such as (Ricky) Ponting, (Michael) Clarke, (Mike) Hussey, Hughes, (Brad) Haddin, (Shane) Watson, (Stuart) Clark, (Simon) Katich, (Peter) Siddle, (Mitchell) Johnson.         
	Have them embark on a combination of rest, physical and then technical preparation for the Ashes while this (World T20) tournament is underway, Buchanan said.         
	The former Aussie coach also lauded Brad Hodge, who has been left out by the Australian selectors despite his brilliant run in the IPL.         
	He has demonstrated in a team that is struggling for runs (Kolkata) just how valuable a player he is, and in this particular format. He is still fitter than many younger players, he fields well and bowls some useful off-spin. He offers an all-round package that should not be overlooked by Australian selectors, he said.         
	Hodge has made 240 runs with a strike rate of 112 for the Knight Riders, behind only the Chennai Super Kings Matthew Hayden and Suresh Raina.         
	Buchanan also felt the slam-bang cricket was not suitable to be played between countries but only among clubs.         
	Given the ICC has chosen to cash in on the excitement of Twenty20 and the potential revenues that can be made, then Australia or any country should treat it for what it is. It is a one-off tournament that will occur periodically in the world tournament schedule, and in my opinion it has little to do with long-term development of player squads.         
	As such selections should be based on the best Twenty20 players of the time, and be cognisant of tournaments before and after (the World Cup).           (PTI)

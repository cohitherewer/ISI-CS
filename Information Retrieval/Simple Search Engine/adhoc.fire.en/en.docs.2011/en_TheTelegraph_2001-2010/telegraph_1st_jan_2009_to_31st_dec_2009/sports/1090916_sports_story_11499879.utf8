	New Delhi: When it comes to the Durand Cup, Mohun Bagan are always the favourites.         
	But, the aura that surrounded the Calcutta giants, no longer exists. In the past 15 years,         
	Bagan, not surprisingly, are keen on breaking the title-drought but as they prepare to tackle ONGC in the opening match on Wednesday, much will depend on their two foreign strikers  Brazilian Jose Barreto and Nigerian Edeh Chidi.         
	Barreto, who played a big role when Mohun Bagan won the Durand Cup last time in 2001, said he saw no point in playing such knockout tournaments.         
	I have been playing in Durand Cup for many years but the approach has remained the same.

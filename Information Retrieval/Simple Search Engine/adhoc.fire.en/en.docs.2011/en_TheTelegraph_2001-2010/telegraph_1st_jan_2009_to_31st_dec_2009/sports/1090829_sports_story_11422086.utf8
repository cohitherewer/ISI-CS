The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL booty for state units
                                                   IPL booty for state units
                      
	Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is set to distribute around Rs 200 crore from the 2009 Indian Premier League (IPL) revenues to 25 of its state associations that take part in the Ranji Trophy and other domestic tournaments conducted by the Board.         
	The earnings for the Board this time from IPL-II conducted in South Africa are lower as compared to IPL-I because of the extra expenses incurred due to the shifting of the tournament overseas, the BCCI sources said on Friday.         
	The IPL income and expenditure statement and detailed accounts for the 2009 edition would be finalised at its governing council meeting here on Wednesday, the sources indicated.         
	Around Rs 280 crore is the revenue earned from the IPL this year out of which 70 per cent would be distributed to the 25 state associations, which works out close to Rs 8 crore for each, they said.         
	Normally the BCCI does not distribute its earnings to its affiliated government institutions  Services and Railways  that also take part in the Ranji Trophy, Board sources said.

                                                   Ruling group to retain panel
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Jagmohan Dalmiya-led ruling group at the Cricket Association of Bengal will fight the annual elections, to be held later this month, with the same panel.         
	Speculation was rife that the Dalmiya camp may seek a replacement for Arun Mitra, the current joint secretary. Mitra was recently operated upon after he injured himself.         
	But Biswarup Dey, the other joint secretary, declined the suggestion.         
	Theres going to be no change in our panel. Mitras incident was unfortunate and theres no question of replacing him, Dey said.         
	Meanwhile, the CAB adjudged Aniruddha Banerjee and Alok Bhattacharya as the best umpires in Grade I, BCCI panel.

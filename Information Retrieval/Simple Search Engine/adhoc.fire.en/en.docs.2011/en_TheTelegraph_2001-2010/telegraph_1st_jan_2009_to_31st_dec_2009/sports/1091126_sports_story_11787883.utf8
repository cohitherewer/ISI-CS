The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We should win from here, says Gambhir
                                                                                                                       7                                      We should win from here, says Gambhir
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Kanpur: India opener Gautam Gambhir feels that bowlers can pick up 19 Sri Lankan wickets in the next three days as the pitch is deteriorating.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On the last hour of play         
	The pitch has started offering some turn and at times its keeping low. Stroke making will be really difficult in the next couple of days. We have a quality bowling attack, and there is no reason why we cant win it from here.         
	If he was disappointed that the total didnt cross 700         
	Not at all. We have scored close to 650, and that is fantastic.         
	Rangana Heraths five-for         
	A five-wicket haul is a five-wicket haul, and he deserves full credit for his performance. His feeling for the bowlers         
	(Smiles) I have a lot of sympathy for Harbhajan (Singh), Amit (Mishra) and Murali because of what they had in Motera. We should have wickets where there is a fair competition between bat and ball.         
	Any change in batting style or mindset         
	I dont think there has been any major change in my style of batting. Its just that I feel a lot more secure about my place in the team.         
	On Virender Sehwags comment that he is the best after Sunil Gavaskar         
	When someone like Sehwag gives you a compliment, you got to take him seriously. Otherwise, these statements really do not matter to me.         
	Rahul Dravids form         
	Everyone knows what he is capable of. Everyone goes through a lean patch, but great players know how to come out of it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Two rebels named among probables
                                                   Two rebels named among probables
                              
	St Johns: The West Indies named Fidel Edwards and Darren Powell, both boycotting national duty owing to a contract dispute, in their 30-member provisional squad for the Champions Trophy, in a surprising move.         
	While the second-string squad, which lost the Test series at home against Bangladesh, forms the core of the Champions Trophy team, Edwards and Powell are surprise inclusions since they had joined Chris Gayle and other frontline players who boycotted the series against Bangladesh.         
	Opener Devon Smith and youngsters Kieron Pollard and Andre Fletcher have also been named among the probables. The West Indies will be in Group A along with Pakistan, India and Australia.         
	The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) has been forced to name a weakened squad since its ongoing dispute with the West Indies Players Association (WIPA) is not yet over.         
	The WIPA has sought governments intervention to solve the impasse, while WICB has written to each and every protesting player, saying they have been breaching their contract by staying away from national duty.         
	The WICB also said it would soon start distributing money it owes to the players but ruled out a renegotiation.         
	The crisis in West Indies cricket has been a godsend for Bangladesh, who registered their first overseas Test victory in this series and then went on to win the second Test as well to make it a first series victory.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Taylor cuts KKR to size
                                                     Taylor cuts KKR to size
            A CORRESPONDENT            David Hussey in action on Tuesday                           
	Tuesdays match turned out to be a battle between two New Zealand cricketers. Brendon McCullum and Ross Taylor vied for honours at SuperSport Park in Centurion, with the Black Caps vice-captain being pipped at the post by his less-fancied teammate.         
	The Kolkata Knight Riders captain finally found his form but that was not enough to change the fortunes of his team.         
	McCullums unbeaten 84 off 64 balls, the highest individual score for the team so far in the second edition of the IPL, was instrumental in their reaching 173 for four. But Taylor blazed his way to an unbeaten 81 off 33 balls as the Royal Challengers Bangalore feasted on some shoddy bowling at the death, to win by six wickets with four balls still remaining.         
	Taylor, quite aptly, finished off the match with a towering six off Sri Lankan Angelo Mathews.         
	When you need over 10-and-a-half runs per over, pretty simply you have to go for it. Its good to contribute to a win and at the same time, enjoy the moment. We are still in the competition, Taylor said.         
	He remained unfazed by the loss of three quick wickets to time the Bangalore Royal Challengers chase to perfection, carting five sixes and seven fours in a brutal assault that overshadowed the Knight Riders commendable batting. The solid opening stand had set the stage for the chase and Anil Kumbles men never looked back.         
	Poor McCullum! He batted superbly and could hardly be blamed for the lacklustre bowling his side dished out.         
	The Knight Riders overcame a poor start  Sourav Ganguly and Arindam Ghosh departed early  as McCullum and David Hussey exposed the limitations in the Royal Challengers attack.         
	The arrival of Hussey brought the much-needed momentum to the innings. Runs came thick and fast as Hussey strode to a 27-ball 43 (3x4, 2x6) in his inimitable style.         
	More than the cameo he produced, it was about the confidence he brought into the middle order. McCullum, too, prospered in his company as the pair went about smashing the rival attack.         
	They also ran the singles hard and the Royal Challengers were hard pressed to keep the run-rate under control. Seventy runs were added in 54 balls during the course of the third-wicket partnership. Not showing any nerves in his maiden match this season, Hussey began with a flourish, hitting a boundary of the second ball he faced. He followed it up with a six and a boundary in the next over. There was no looking back as the Australians clean hitting left the Royal Challengers dazed. Even Kumble wasnt spared as he disdainfully hoisted him over long-off.         
	Hussey left in the 14th over going for an expansive shot on the leg side, but McCullum made sure his departure didnt affect the side. Having been let off by Mark Boucher, the Knight Riders captain combined aggression with caution in the early part of his innings to finally come good in the tournament.         
	There were the beautifully-timed drives that gave the fielders no chance along with the risky scoops behind the wicket, that reminded one Zimbabwean Douglas Merillier. He was at his lethal best once Hussey departed, and Angelo Mathews was a mere spectator during the 43-run fourth-wicket stand. In all, McCullum hit ten boundaries and two sixes.         
	He dispatched Kumble over extra cover, and smashed Akhil Kumar for two sixes over mid-wicket and square-leg, the latter bringing up his first fifty in ten innings.         
	Three successive fours  two paddle-scoops and one contemptuous pull  followed off Vinay Kumar, the 19th over producing 16 runs. Kallis last over, during which he bowled two no-balls, was taken for 20, including a monstrous six by Wriddhiman Saha off the final delivery.         
	It was mainly due to McCullums pyrotechnics that 104 runs came off the last ten overs. That, however, proved too little in the end.

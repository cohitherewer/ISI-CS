                                                     Mixed fortunes for the Indians
                              
	Wimbledon: Sania Mirzas singles campaign at the Wimbledon Championships ended with a 4-6, 4-6 second round loss to Romanian 28th seed Sorana Cirstea on Wednesday.         
	However, fourth seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles survived a scare from spirited qualifiers Somdev Dev Varman and Kevin Anderson in a gruelling four-setter to enter the second round of mens doubles.         
	Later the unseeded Indo-Pakistani duo of Prakash Amritraj and Aisam-ul Haq Qureshi stunned 16th seeds Stephen Huss and Ross Hutchins in a see-saw five-set battle to advance to the second round.         
	Unforced errors proved costly for Sania in the 82-minute contest as she yet again failed to move beyond the second round here.         
	Sania played mostly from the baseline but struggled to keep her booming strokes within the court. The inability to win points on serve added to the woes of the unseeded Indian against an opponent ranked as high as 27th in the world.         
	Sania had the first opportunity to get a break but Cirstea denied her friend the favour. Sania then committed a double fault in the fifth game to hand the 2009 French Open semi-finalist a break point. The Indian saved four breakpoints in that game but another double fault undid all the good work.         
	That one break proved costly for the Hyderabadi as the next four games went with serve with Cirstea claiming the first set.         
	The second set too started on an ominous note as Sania dropped her serve in the very first game. Though she managed a double break  second and fourth games  to take a 3-1 lead, the unrelenting errors allowed the Romanian claw her way back.         
	Sania will now look to put up a better show in doubles where she and her Taipei partner Chia-Jung Chuang will take on Americans Jill Craybas and Carly Gullickson.         
	Bhupathi and Knowles came through 6-7(4-7), 6-4, 7-5, 7-5 in a nerve-wracking battle in which the Indo-South African duo pushed the fourth seeds to their limits before going down in three hours and 15 minutes.         
	In the opening set, Somdev and Anderson twice overcame a 1-4 deficit, second time in the tie-breaker, to go one up.         
	But the Indo-Bahamian pair used all their experience to survive the fight, winning the next three sets.         
	The qualifiers had an early break opportunity in the second set  in the second game  but the seeded players not only saved that but also went on to break them in the fifth game. Somdev and Anderson then wasted two breakpoints in the eighth game and went on to lose to the second set.         
	The third set also saw an intense fight as first 10 games went with serve and both the pairs saved a breakpoint each.         
	Somdev and Anderson dropped their serve in the first game of the fourth set but made a good comeback, riding on breaks in the fourth and sixth games, which gave them a 4-2 lead.         
	However, Bhupathi and Knowles broke them twice  seventh and 11th games  before serving out the match.         
	Amritraj and Qureshi scripted a sensational 6-4, 6-7(12-14), 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 triumph after slogging it out for close to four hours in a match that spanned two days.         
	The two teams were locked 2-2 Tuesday and Amritraj and Qureshi came back to finish it off in their favour.         
	The 16th seeded Australian-British pair of Huss and Hutchins were in for a tough fight. After losing the opening set, Huss and Hutchins battled it out for 70 minutes in the second to clinch it 14-12 in the tie-break.         
	Amritraj and Qureshi recovered well to go one up again but not ones to give up, Huss and Hutchins equalised in the next set. The roller-coaster match finally ended with the Indo-Pak pair dominating the decider to script a magnificent triumph.

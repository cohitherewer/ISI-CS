The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mexico sack Eriksson
                                                     Mexico sack Eriksson
                  Eriksson                     
	Mexico City: Mexico coach Sven-Goran Eriksson was fired Thursday, a day after a 3-1 loss to Honduras in World Cup qualifying.         
	We told Mr Eriksson that his term with the national team has finished, said Justino Compean, president of the Mexican Football Federation in a news conference.         
	We could not risk Mexicos participation in the World Cup.         
	Mexicos fifth straight defeat away from home in qualifying on Wednesday dropped them to fourth and out of the automatic World Cup spots in the six-team Concacaf finals.         
	At the helm for less than a year, Eriksson won only four of nine qualifiers, and all at home. In 13 matches overall, he won six and drew one.         
	After the announcement, Eriksson said the countrys patience had run out. He said he, too, was frustrated by the results but wished the team luck and remained optimistic Mexico would still qualify for next years World Cup in South Africa.         
	The 61-year-old Swede, the first foreigner to coach Mexico in 11 years, was hired last June to 2010.         
	Eriksson replaced Mexican star Hugo Sanchez, who was fired after the national under23 team failed to qualify for the Olympics.         
	Eriksson stirred controversy inside a country fiercely loyal to its national team when he added four naturalised citizens to the roster.         
	Possible candidates being mentioned for the job include former Atletico Madrid coach Javier Aguirre, who left the struggling Spanish club also after a losing streak, and Jose Manuel de la Torre, the coach of Toluca, last years Mexican league champion. Both men are Mexican.         
	With Wednesdays win, Honduras leapfrogged Mexico in Concacaf qualifying from last place to third with four points, one ahead of the Mexicans. The United States led with seven points, and Costa Rica was second with six.         
	Eriksson was Englands first foreign manager for five years, and left after leading the side to the 2006 World Cup quarter finals. He then revived Manchester City but left a year into his three-year contract for Mexico.

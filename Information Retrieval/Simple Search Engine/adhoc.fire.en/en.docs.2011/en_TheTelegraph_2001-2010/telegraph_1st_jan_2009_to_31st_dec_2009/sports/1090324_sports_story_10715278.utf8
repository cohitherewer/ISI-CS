The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand crushes Kramnik
                                                   Anand crushes Kramnik
                      
	Nice: Viswanathan Anand crushed Vladimir Kramnik in the blindfold section and romped home with a 1.5-0.5 victory in the crucial eighth round of the Amber blindfold and rapid chess tournament, here on Monday. Anand won the blindfold game and surged ahead in this section to share the second spot in this section.         
	With the rapid game ending in a draw the Indian ace is now in sole lead on 10.5 points.         
	Levon Aronian of Armenia defeated Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan in the blindfold game and played out a draw in the rapid to win by a similar margin like Anand and so did Magnus Carlsen of Norway in his match against Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria.         
	Both Carlsen and Aronain remained on Anands heels, half point behind, and it might well be a race between these three for the title in the last three rounds.         
	Kramnik slipped to fourth following the loss with 9.5 points. The fifth place is held by Peter Leko of Hungary on 8.5 points, while American Gata Kamsky, Topalov and Alexander Morozevich of Russia are locked on 7.5 points apiece. Ukrainians Vassily Ivanchuk and Sergey Karjakin and Radjabov share the ninth spot on 6.5 points, while Wang Yue of China is now in the cellar with 5.5.         
	In the blindfold section, Carlsen is in sole lead with 6.5 points followed by Anand a point behind. In the rapid section, Anand shares the lead with Kamsky and Aronian with 5 points.         
	The clash of the day between leaders Anand and Kramnik started with an impressive victory for the world champion in the blindfold game.         
	In their first encounter since their match in Bonn a few months back, Anand played the King pawn allowing his rival to go for his favourite Petroff Defence.           (PTI)

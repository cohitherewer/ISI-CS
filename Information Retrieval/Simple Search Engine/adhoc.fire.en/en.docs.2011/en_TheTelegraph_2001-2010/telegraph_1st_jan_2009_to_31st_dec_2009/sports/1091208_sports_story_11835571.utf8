The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav lifts sagging morale
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sourav lifts sagging morale
            A STAFF REPORTER            Sourav Ganguly                           
	Calcutta: The last time Sourav Ganguly played at Green Park, he won the match for India. His innings of 87 against South Africa on a dustbowl is still considered one of his most memorable Test knocks. It was a lesson on how to play spinners on a rank turner.         
	After 19 months, he is back again in Kanpur. This time on another mission  to ensure that his state team remains in contention for a quarter final berth in the Ranji Trophy as they take on Uttar Pradesh in a crucial group league encounter starting Tuesday.         
	Souravs presence at the team meeting helped lift sagging spirits as, for all practical purposes, it is a do-or-die match for the visitors who are currently fourth in Group B, with eight points.         
	They must ensure at least three points from this encounter or else the last group league encounter against Delhi at home will be an inconsequential one.         
	Dadas speech at the team meeting was really motivating. He said, Its up to us to get out of the rut. All of us will have to collectively find a way out and we will do it. It really felt good when he addressed the players, a senior player said. It has been learnt that Sourav also provided valuable suggestions about the composition of the squad.         
	It will be Souravs first away match in the Ranji Trophy and the veteran pro will definitely want to do his bit for the team.         
	Not only Sourav, it will also depend on how skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla and the nine others perform.         
	The basic problem with Bengal has been their failure to click as a team. There have been occasional good performances by a few but save the trio of Manoj Tiwary (373 from three matches), Arindam Das (364 runs from three matches) and Deep Dasgupta (225 runs from four matches), the others havent really done anything worthwhile.         
	With two potent swing bowlers  Praveen Kumar and Rudra Pratap Singh  in the opposition ranks, batting on a Green Park strip which has a fair bit of green will be challenging for the batsmen.         
	Left-arm spinner Iresh Saxena has his nose ahead for a berth in the XI although there is talk of playing a third seamer in Nilkantha Das.         
	Young opener Rohan Banerjee, in all likelihood, will be dropped as Shukla looks set for a comeback after being out with a quadriceps strain in the last two matches.         
	Deep will then open with Arindam Das who is fit to play after being hit on the chest by a Ranadeb Bose delivery during Sundays practice session. It will also be an important match for Wriddhiman Saha who hasnt done much with the bat this season.         
	If the middle-order is a worry for Shukla, the bowlers performance in the last three matches is sure to give him sleepless nights.         
	Apart from Ranadeb Bose and Saurashis Lahiri (17 wickets each), none of the other bowlers have been able to bag even 10 wickets from four matches.         
	Neither has Bose been able to deliver on expectations after his initial 10-wicket haul.         
	One piece of statistic is enough to illustrate the bowlers woeful form. On three days against three different teams, they gave away more than 300 runs  400 (vs Baroda on the final day), 336 (vs Karnataka on the third day) and 384 (vs Saurashtra on the first day).

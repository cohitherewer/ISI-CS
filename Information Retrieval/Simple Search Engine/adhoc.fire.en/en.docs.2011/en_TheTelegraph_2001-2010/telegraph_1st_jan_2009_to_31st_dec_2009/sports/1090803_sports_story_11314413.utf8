	Rome: Ryan Lochte of the US won his fourth gold medal of the World Championships, and four more world records fell on Sunday on the final night of the fastest meet in swimming history.         
	Taking advantage of Michael Phelps absence, Lochte added the 400-metre individual medley title to his medal haul at the Foro Italico. Lochte also won the 200m individual medley along with two relay golds, in addition to taking bronze in the 200m backstroke.         
	Lochte was far off Phelps world record in the 400m individual medley, touching first in 4 minutes, 7.01 seconds. Phelps won gold at Beijing in 4:03.84s, but decided to scale back his program heading into what will be his final Olympics.         
	The Americans still went 1-2 even without Phelps. Tyler Clary came on strong in the freestyle to beat Hungarys Laszlo Cseh, taking silver in 4:07.31s. Cseh settled for bronze at 4:07.37s.         
	Phelps was going for his fifth gold of the meet in the final event, the 400m medley relay.         
	Its new for me to be in the spotlight in an individual medley race, Lochte said. Im very happy I broke Phelps record in the 200 individual medley. I hope someday he will be back in this race because I love racing against him.         
	Britains Liam Tancock broke his own world record to win the 50m backstroke. Tancock touched in 24.04, eclipsing the mark of 24.08 he set the previous day in the semi-finals. Japans Junya Koga claimed silver in 24.24s, while South Africas Gerhard Zandberg earned bronze at 24.34s.         
	Russias Yuliya Efimova followed with the 41st record of the meet, edging American Rebecca Soni in the 50m breaststroke. Efimova won in 30.09s, breaking the record of 30.23s set by Canadas Amanda Reason less than a month ago. The next two also went under the old mark, with Soni (30.11) taking silver and Australias Sarah Katsoulis (30.16) the bronze.         
	At the beginning I had a lot of speed, I did better than I expected and Im happy about that, Efimova told reporters.         
	Neither the 50m back nor the 50m breast is on the Olympic program.         
	Germanys Britta Steffen set her third world record of the Championships, winning the 50m freestyle in 23.73 seconds. Forty-year-old American Dara Torres was last.         
	Steffen completed the 50-100 freestyle sweep in a blistering race, beating the mark of 23.96 held by Marleen Veldhuis of the Netherlands since April.         
	Steffen broke the 100m free record twice in Rome, part of the staggering 42 world records set during the eight-day meet.         
	Swedens Therese Alshammar also went under the old mark for silver (23.88). Australian teenager Cate Campbell got bronze in 23.99.         
	Torres failed to match her silver-medal showing from the Olympics. Bothered by a sore knee that will require surgery, she was eighth in 24.48.         
	Hungarys Katinka Hosszu snatched gold in the womens 400m individual medley final.         
	She surged through the water in four minutes 30.31 with Zimbabwes Kirsty Coventry taking silver and Olympic champion Stephanie Rice of Australia bagging bronze.         
	Tunisias Olympic champion Oussama Mellouli turned on the style to win the mens 1,500m freestyle title.         
	Mellouli powered home in 14 minutes 37.28 seconds, comfortably beating second-placed Canadian Ryan Cochrane and bronze-medallist Sun Yang of China. I am proud for Tunisia and Tunisian sport, Mellouli told reporters.         
	The United States and Michael Phelps smashed their own world record to win the mens 4x100 metres medley relay final.         
	The Americans swam three minutes 27.28 to finish ahead of second-placed Germany and Australia in third.

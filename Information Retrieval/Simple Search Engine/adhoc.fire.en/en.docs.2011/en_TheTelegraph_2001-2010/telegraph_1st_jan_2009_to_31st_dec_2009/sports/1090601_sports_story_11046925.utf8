The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Drogba braced for suspension
                                                   Drogba braced for suspension
                      
	London: Didier Drogba pledged to accept his probable Champions League suspension with good grace Sunday. The Ivory Coast striker is facing a lengthy ban after being charged with misconduct for his behaviour towards Tom Henning Ovrebo, the referee, at the end of Chelseas draw with Barcelona in the second leg of their semi-final last month, which led to their elimination from the competition on away goals.         
	Drogba is expecting to be given a three-match ban when the case is heard by Uefas disciplinary hearing on June 17, although his punishment could be even more severe. Drogba has not requested a personal hearing, while the club will also rely on written submissions when answering the separate charge of failing to control their players.         
	Drogba issued an apology  but did not say sorry to the referee  on the day after his outburst and is resigned to his fate.           THE TIMES, LONDON

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Railways man for   NZ again
                                                   Railways man for   NZ again
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: Its a Railways man again!         
	Rakesh Yadav, the Railway Sports Promotion Board (RSPB) secretary, has left for New Zealand to replace former Board secretary Niranjan Shah as the Team India manager.         
	The RSPBs Nathu Ram Choudhary, it may be recalled, had been the manager on the last tour there, in 2002-03. The RSPB is an affiliate of the Board.         
	Usually, a managerial assignment to New Zealand is low on pressure (one reason being theres no media frenzy of the kind seen in England or Australia) and, so, is much sought after. Also, given the beautiful locales, the family could join for a holiday which is unlikely to be forgotten in a hurry.         
	Good reasons, clearly, to be in New Zealand.         
	Shah, a businessman-cum-administrator who operates out of Rajkot, will (as was decided before the tour itself) return home after the fifth and final ODI, in Auckland, on Saturday.         
	Yadav will be in New Zealand for the three-Test series, which begins on March 18 and ends on April 7.         
	Meanwhile, as was indicated by The Telegraph on March 1, national selectors Narendra Hirwani and Surendra Bhave are heading East to join the Mahendra Singh Dhonis.         
	They couldnt leave in time to watch Team India create history in the ODIs, on Wednesday, but both are reaching New Zealand before the Tests get underway.         
	A rotational system within the quintet will probably see selection committee chairman Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Raja Venkat travel to England for the ICC World T20, in June.         
	Yashpal Sharma and either Hirwani or Bhave are (as of now) expected to watch the four-match ODI series in the West Indies, immediately after the World T20.         
	No selector had gone to Sri Lanka, during the short tour there in January-February, but that was a one-off miss.

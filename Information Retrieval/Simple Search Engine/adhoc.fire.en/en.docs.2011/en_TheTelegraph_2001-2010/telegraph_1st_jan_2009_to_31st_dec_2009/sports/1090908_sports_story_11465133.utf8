                                                     Sehwag: I dont want to be captain
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Sehwag                           
	Calcutta/New Delhi: Virender Sehwag Monday said he doesnt want to be the captain of the Indian team and suggested that a new face be given the vice-captains responsibility so that he can be groomed to take over the reins after Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	I dont want to be a captain, I have already told the selectors that. I have said a new player should be made vice-captain and be groomed to be a captain, Sehwag told a TV channel.         
	I want to continue scoring runs and keep winning matches for the team, he added.         
	For a number of years there had been a settled captain and vice-captain duo when Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid, respectively, were in charge. That changed in October 2005 when Sourav was removed as captain and Dravid took over.         
	The vice-captaincy then went to Sehwag.         
	The next season (2006-07), though, saw Sehwag suffering a dip in form and, with it, losing the vice-captaincy. He was replaced in Tests by V.V.S. Laxman. The stylish Hyderabad batsmans run, though, was for a brief period.         
	Things took a dramatic turn when Sachin Tendulkar agreed to be Dravids deputy before the 2007 World Cup. Sachin, however, was rested for the one-dayers in Bangladesh soon after the quadrennial showpiece in the West Indies and the vacancy thus created was filled by Dhoni.         
	Later that year, Dravid decided to quit as captain and, while Dhoni got the top job in ODIs and Twenty20s, Sachin refused to lead in Tests. That paved the way for Anil Kumble and the leg-spinner was made Test captain towards the end of his career.         
	Kumbles deputy was the ODI and Twenty20 captain Dhoni. The wicketkeeper-batsman became the captain in all forms when Kumble retired in November last year.         
	Sehwag got back the vice-captaincy, but his injury in the lead up to the World Twenty20 in June this year, saw the No.2 position going to Yuvraj Singh.         
	Today the leadership combination features Dhoni and Yuvraj.         
	Sehwag, who plays for the Delhi DareDevils, also said he will be fully fit before the Champions League which starts from October 10.         
	Sehwag considers Sourav as the best captain. Sourav has been the best captain India has ever had, he said.         
	Sourav took over as captain when the team was passing through a very bad patch. The team was struggling to come out of the match-fixing scandal. He had a responsibility to put together a new team and he did a splendid job, Sehwag said.

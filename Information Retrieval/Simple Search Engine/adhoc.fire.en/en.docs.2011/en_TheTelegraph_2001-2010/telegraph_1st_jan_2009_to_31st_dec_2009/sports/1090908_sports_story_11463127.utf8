	Karachi: Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam Monday alleged that a particular lobby is running a smear campaign to oust him and said he wont get bogged down by the criticism.         
	Intikhab told a TV channel that there are some former players in the PCB who didnt want to see him continue as coach.         
	These people, this lobby is running a campaign against me and trying to pressurise me. It is sad but I am not going to back down. I have been given a responsibility and I will fulfil it till the PCB chairman has confidence in me, he said.         
	Former Test captain Aamer Sohail had Sunday accused Intikhab of fomenting intrigue and groupings within the team. (PTI)

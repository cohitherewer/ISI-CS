            A CORRESPONDENT              Mahendra Singh Dhoni en route to his century on Friday                      
	Nagpur: Tillekaratne Dilshan continued with his blistering form to lead Sri Lanka to victory in the second one-day International against India, in neighbouring Jamtha, on Friday.         
	Chasing a formidable 302, the visitors rode Dilshans 123 and a 25-ball 37 from all-rounder Angelo Mathews to win by three wickets and level the five-match series at 1-1.         
	Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara lauded his team for the victory. He singled out Dilshan for his superb effort with the bat but reminded that they still needed to improve their fielding.                 
	The following are excerpts               
	Sangakkara: Again a close match and its good that we won. But we are still making quite a few mistakes on the field, dropping catches and missing run outs. We need to keep improving in order to maintain the good work.         
	There are also the injury problems So, we need to work hard in order to do well.         
	We could have kept Indias score to less than 270-280 had we been sharper on the field. There were quite a few lapses I should have latched on to (Mahendra Singh) Dhonis catch I missed a stumping chance too. So, all that could have proved fatal at the end.         
	But it was a great effort from Dilshan. He kept finding the gaps and that did the trick for us. The others too contributed Upul Tharangas 37 opening the innings was very important.         
	Mathews, who is only 21, played a brilliant knock to see us through. Debutant Suraj Randiv had an excellent day with the ball. They all put up a fantastic performance. They have a great future and can keep getting better.         
	Though it has basically been a batsmans series so far, the ones on the field tried hard and had their moments. Im very proud of the boys. Its important we keep enjoying ourselves and keep learning from our mistakes.         
	Dhoni: We didnt get a good start and then when we got a good partnership (between him and Suresh Raina) going, we lost wickets at regular intervals. So, I was quite happy that we reached 300. All we needed was a couple of wickets at the right time.         
	The only way we could have won was by taking wickets The spinners were under pressure when they had to bowl during the Powerplays and we also required early wickets. We also leaked quite a few runs         
	(Virat) Kohli batted really well. There was pressure when he came into bat Raina also batted well, but he has already proved himself at the international level.         
	Its true that the batsmen have dominated in this series so far, but the bowlers have also done well in patches. All you need to change the complexion of a game are one or two good overs and a couple of wickets. That is what really matters. Once you get wickets, the bowlers can perform more freely.         
	For Sri Lanka, debutant Randiv was good, but he was not challenged.         
	The wicket was good it offered a bit of turn and there was a bit of dew as well. Overall, the wicket played quite well.         
	Dilshan: It has definitely been a very good year for me. We were confident of chasing down the total. It was all about taking chances and finding the gaps.I have changed my mindset and that has helped me. Now, whenever I get a start I try to convert it into a big score and not throw it way.         
	Angelo Mathews has been batting very well and playing a useful role.         
	Batsmen have dominated both the games in the series and have given no chance to the bowlers.         
	Both sides are playing well and the next three games will be interesting.

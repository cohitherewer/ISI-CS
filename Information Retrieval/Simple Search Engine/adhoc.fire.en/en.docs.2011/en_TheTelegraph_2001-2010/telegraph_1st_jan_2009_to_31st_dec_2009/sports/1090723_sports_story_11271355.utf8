                                                   Snehasish files papers
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Snehasish Ganguly on Wednesday said it was unfortunate and surprising, if true, that the ruling group in the CAB had tried to prevent Sourav Ganguly from making a foray into cricket administration.         
	Sourav will attend the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) annual general meeting on July 31 from Mohammedan Sporting.         
	He will also be a member of the newly-formed working committee representing Bhukailash Sporting.         
	Snehasish on Wednesday filed his papers for attending the AGM as a representative for Barisha Sporting. He also deposited Souravs papers.         
	I have heard that some in the ruling group had tried hard to prevent Sourav from making it to the working committee and the AGM If true, its surprising and very unfortunate, said the former assistant secretary.         
	Joint secretary Biswarup Dey, however, rubbished such talk.         
	This is not true. We never tried to stop Sourav from getting into administration. I dont know the basis of such allegations.         
	We have always maintained that he is welcome in any capacity. His experience will be valuable for the betterment of Bengal cricket, said Dey.         
	National selector Raja Venkat also filed his papers to attend the AGM from Ballygunge Sporting.

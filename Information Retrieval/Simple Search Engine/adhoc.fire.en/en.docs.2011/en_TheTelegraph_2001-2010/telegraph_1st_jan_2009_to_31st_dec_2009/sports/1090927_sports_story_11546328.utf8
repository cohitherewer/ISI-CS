                                                     Interim relief for Bhutia
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bhaichung Bhutia at the East Bengal tent on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	New Delhi: Decks were cleared on Saturday for Bhaichung Bhutia to don the East Bengal colours in the I-League as the All India Football federation (AIFF) appointed arbitrator granted him temporary relief to play for the club of his own choice.         
	The arbitrator, Amarendra Sharan, a former additional solicitor general of India , said: Bhaichung Bhutia can play for the club of his own choice. The ruling was in response to Bhutias plea for interim relief. However, the case between Mohun Bagan and Bhutia will continue till a final verdict is reached.         
	The arbitrator also said: Bhaichung has to give an undertaking that in the event the final verdict goes against him, he will have to sit out for the remaining period of his suspension.         
	The Indian captain was suspended by Mohun Bagan for six months on June 8 for missing practice sessions and an exhibition match at Jalpaiguri. An irate Bhutia hit back saying that a section of the club officials were trying to tarnish his image and sought a transfer to East Bengal that was hotly contested by Mohun Bagan.         
	On September 3, the AIFF appointed an arbitrator to resolve the dispute after repeated efforts by the general secretary, Alberto Colaco, failed.         
	While the interim relief granted by Sharan had the Mohun Bagan official fuming, Bhutia said it came as a great relief for him. The Mohun Bagan officials were trying to destroy my career. I am happy I could thwart their attempts.         
	The suspension order, Bhaichung said had already done a lot of damage to him. For more than three months I am sitting without a salary. I also could not play two important tournaments like IFA Shield and Durand Cup. But my fight is not yet over. If any other footballer is victimised like this, I vow to fight for him, said Bhutia, who led India to two back to back triumphs in the Nehru Cup.         
	Mohun Bagan general secretary Anjan Mitra said: The order is not in accordance with the AIFF constitution, which has no provision for interim relief. The arbitrator has allowed Bhaichung to play for East Bengal. What will happen if Bhaichung is found guilty in the final verdict? We will be in no position to take him since under the AIFF rules a footballer can play for only one club in a particular season.         
	AIFF sources said things would be clear only after the arbitrator submits his full order on the interim relief. There is a possibility that Bhutia may have been cleared in the inter-club transfer dispute. The rest of the arbitration may now only be about the six-month suspension.         
	The sources also pointed out that Mohun Bagan wouldnt be in a position to approach the court of law since the process of arbitration was not yet over.

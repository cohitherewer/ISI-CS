                                                   Securitymen humiliate Jayaprakash 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Vadodara: Former international umpire A.V. Jayaprakash, who is now a regional performance manager of the ICC, was humiliated by security personnel at The Gateway Hotel on Saturday evening.         
	The securitymen werent impressed with Jayaprakashs accreditation card and made him stand at the gate for four-five minutes.         
	It was only after a Baroda Cricket Association official and a journalist intervened that Jayaprakash was allowed to enter the hotel which is hosting the Indian and Australian teams.         
	Before being allowed in, though, Jayaprakash was frisked twice within five metres  by a policeman and, then, by one of the private security guards employed by the hotel.         
	As already reported by The Telegraph, security has gone to quite another level this time.

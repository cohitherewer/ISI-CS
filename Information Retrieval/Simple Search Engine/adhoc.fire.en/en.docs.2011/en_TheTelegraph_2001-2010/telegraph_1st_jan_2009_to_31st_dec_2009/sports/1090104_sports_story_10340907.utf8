The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No plan for Lanka tour, says BCCI
                                                   No plan for Lanka tour, says BCCI
            OUR BUREAU                      
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty has denied that India are exploring the possibility of a one-day series in Sri Lanka to compensate for the cancelled tour of Pakistan.         
	On Saturday newspapers in Sri Lanka, however, did mention that a series was being worked out between the two boards.         
	Contacted by The Telegraph, Shetty said: What we have done is to approach New Zealand Cricket for an extra Test. No question of touring Sri Lanka for a one-day series. Obviously, we cant be negotiating with two boards at the same time.         
	India are supposed to begin their tour of New Zealand on March 6 with a Twenty20 International. The five ODIs and two Test matches will follow.         
	In case an extra Test match is okayed, the tour will begin much earlier.         
	Meanwhile, reports from Karachi said the Sri Lankan cricket officials were delaying finalising the itinerary for the Pakistan tour because they first want to work out a window for a lucrative one-day series against India.         
	The Sri Lankans have made it clear that they are very keen to play against India as this guaranteed them maximum revenues. This could be one reason why they have asked Pakistan to reschedule their tour from January, one source said.         
	Because of this reason they want the Pakistan tour delayed until late February and have also reduced the number of matches from three Tests and five one-day Internationals to two Tests and three one-day games, the source said.

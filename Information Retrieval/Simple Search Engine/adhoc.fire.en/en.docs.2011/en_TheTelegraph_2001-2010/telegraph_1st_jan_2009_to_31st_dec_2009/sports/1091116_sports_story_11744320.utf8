The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Poor finish for Anand
                                                                                                                                   Poor finish for Anand
                      
	Moscow: Viswanathan Anand went down to Levon Aronian in his final round match to finish a lowly fifth in the Tal Memorial Chess tournament here.         
	Going into the match at joint second, Anand needed to win the battle of wits to join eventual champion Vladimir Kramnik at the top but Aronian beat the Indian with black pieces to shatter his hope.         
	Kramnik drew his match against Vassily Ivanchuk to collect half a point which was enough to win with a total of 6/9 and a 2883 performance.         
	Norwegian prodigy Magnus Carlsen beat Peter Leko and will reach the number one in the world in unofficial live rankings.         
	Anand gained 1.7 points from his plus one score in this event.           (PTI)

                                                   Great to win for India: Bopanna
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Rohan Bopanna could not say whether it was joy or relief after winning the second singles and putting India 2-0 up in the Davis Cup World Group play-off against South Africa, in Johannesburg, on Friday.         
	Well, its been a while since I have played singles. There have not been that many matches and Rik (de Voest) was staying up and putting pressure on my serves, Bopanna told The Telegraph after beating South Africas No.1 player.         
	Probably that was one reason why the 29-year-old Indian had only a 44 per cent of first serves in the opening set. Besides, he had also lost both his singles matches against Chinese Taipei and the focus was on him after Somdev Dev Varman won the opening singles.         
	But thankfully, Bofors soon found his touch and started firing his usual booming serves. In fact, from going down 0-5 in the start, Bopanna turned it around completely and wrapped up the match with three aces and a service winner in the final game.         
	Once we had a 1-0 lead, the pressure was on them. Rik came out firing in the first set but I kept my focus, Bopanna said.         
	Personally it is great to win for India. We are 2-0 up and looking to qualify for the World Group It is a great situation to be in. I am glad I came through.         
	The 63 tall Coorgi faces another test on Saturday when he combines with Mahesh Bhupathi in the doubles against Wesley Moodie and Jeff Coetzee. We have to go out and play positive. We have to close it out tomorrow (Saturday), he said.         
	Captain Shiv-Prakash Misra was all praise for his players. In the absence of Leander (Paes), the boys had a point to prove, he said.         
	Our chances are quite fair but I am not counting the chickens before they hatch. The opponents are a world class pair and no push overs. So lets see, he said.

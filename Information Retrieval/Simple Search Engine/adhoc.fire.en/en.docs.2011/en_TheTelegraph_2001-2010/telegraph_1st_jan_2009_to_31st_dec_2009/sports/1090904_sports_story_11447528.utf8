The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Blues pick up transfer ban
                                                   Blues pick up transfer ban
                      
	Zurich: Fifa Thursday banned Chelsea from signing any players for the next two transfer windows because the club encouraged a French player to break his contract and sign for the club.         
	The world governing body of football said Chelsea cant register any new players, from England or abroad, during the next two transfer windows  in January 2010 and the next off-season. The next time the team would be able to sign a new player would be in January 2011.         
	Fifas Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) made the ruling after Lens complained that Chelsea lured teenage striker Gael Kakuta to break his contract with the French club and move to London in 2008.         
	The DRC found that the player had indeed breach(ed) a contract signed with the French club, Fifa said in a statement. Equally, the DRC deemed it to be established that the English club induced the player to such breach.         
	Chelsea is banned from registering any new players, either nationally or internationally, for the two next entire and consecutive registration periods following the notification of the present decision.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania rises despite loss in Pattaya
                                                     Sania rises despite loss in Pattaya
                  Sania Mirza                     
	New Delhi: Sania Mirzas sizzling run at the Pattaya Open, where she lost in the final, has propelled her back in the top 100 as she jumped 39 places to be at 87 in the latest WTA rankings issued on Monday.         
	The semi-final appearance in the doubles competition at the same event also helped Sania gain seven places in the doubles ranking and she is now at 63. Sanias ranking had plummeted to 126 as she spent almost half of the 2008 season out of courts due to a wrist injury.         
	In the ATP rankings, Rohan Bopannas appearance in the doubles final at the SAP Open in the United States, where he and Finnish partner Jarkko Nieminen lost 2-6, 3-6 to the pairing of Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic and Tommy Haas of Germany, helped him gain seven places and he now stands at 78.         
	However, the same result for Leander Paes at the World Tennis tournament did not help him to improve his current ranking of seven. Leander and partner, the Czech Lukas Dlouhy, lost to Canadian Daniel Nestor and Serbian Nenad Zimonjic.         
	Mahesh Bhupathi, who did not play last week, remained at number five. (agencies)

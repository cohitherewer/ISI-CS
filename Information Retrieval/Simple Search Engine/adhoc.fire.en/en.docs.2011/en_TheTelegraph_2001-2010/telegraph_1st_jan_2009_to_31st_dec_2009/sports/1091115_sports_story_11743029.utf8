	Fes (Morocco): Cameroon beat Morocco 2-0 on Saturday to qualify for next years World Cup finals in South Africa.         
	It will be Cameroons sixth World Cup appearance, a record for an African country.         
	Achille Webo skipped past the Morocco defence to fire a low shot from the edge of the area inside the post in the 18th minute. Samuel Eto doubled the lead in the 52nd, diverting home a header from Jean Makoun.         
	Morocco goalkeeper Nadir Lamyaghri made two outstanding saves to prevent the Indomitable Lions extending their lead.         
	Cameroon topped Group A with 13 points from six qualifying matches.         
	Morocco finished last in Group A with three points and will therefore not even participate in the African Cup of Nations next January in Angola.         
	At Abidjan, Ivory Coast had already booked their ticket for the finals but ended their qualifying campaign on a high note with a 3-0 victory over Guinea. Gervinho netted in the 16th and 31st minutes before Siaka Tiene sealed the win with a free kick in the 68th.         
	In Moscow, Diniyar Bilyaletdinov struck twice to help Russia take a step toward South Africa, beating Slovenia 2-1 in their first-leg European playoff.         
	Bilyaletdinovs first goal came in the 40th minute after the Everton midfielder outwitted two Slovenia defenders inside the area and blasted a right-footed shot into the top right corner of the net.         
	Bilyaletdinov rolled in his second from six meters after his attempted pass inside the box rebounded off a defender and came back to him.         
	Slovenia did not present much of an attacking force, hardly troubling Russia goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev until the 87th minute, when substitute Nejc Pecnik headed a valuable away goal for the visitors.         
	In a sign that Slovenia werent conent with a draw, it was defender Marko Suler who had the nights first shot on goal after an eighth-minute corner, but he struck wide.         
	Zhirkov came to Russias rescue a minute later as he blocked a goalbound volley from Valter Birsa.         
	The Chelsea fullback exchanged passes with Bilyaletdinov shortly after and went past several defenders, breaking into the area and sending a shot that goalkeeper Samir Handanovic kicked away.         
	Vfl Bochum striker Zlatko Dedic downed a long pass and avoided onrushing Russia goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev, but couldnt find the target from a tight angle. Handanovic saved a thunderous long-range free kick from Russia defender Sergei Ignashevic in the 32nd.         
	Russia had the early chances of the second half, with Andrei Arshavins header drifting wide and Roman Pavlyuchenkos volley blocked by Bostjan Cesar a minute later.         
	Pavlyuchenko directed a 69th-minute diving header straight at Handanovic after a flowing move and cross by Konstantin Ziryanov, and substitute Vladimir Bystrov sent a lob over the bar when clear through in the 70th minute.         
	Bilyaletdinov missed his chance for a hat trick five minutes from time, sending a header from Ziryanovs cross just wide. Slovenia then pulled a goal back when captain Robert Koren forced a fingertip save from Akinfeev, only for Pecnik to head in the rebound from close range.         
	Akinfeev then saved his team in the second minute of extra time, diving to his right to tip a Marko Suler shot round the post.           (AGENCIES)

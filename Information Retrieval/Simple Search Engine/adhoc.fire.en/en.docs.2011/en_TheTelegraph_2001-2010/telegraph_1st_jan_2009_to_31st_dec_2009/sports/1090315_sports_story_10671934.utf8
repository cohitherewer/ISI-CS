	Cuttack: Arjun Yadav and Ravichandran Ashwin saved South Zone the blushes as their team recovered from a miserable start to beat Zimbabwe Presidents XI by three wickets in their must-win Group B tie of the zonal one-dayers for Deodhar Trophy at the Ravenshaw University Ground, here on Saturday.         
	Chasing a modest 194 from the stipulated 50 overs, South struggled to find their rhythm going. Having lost to West on Friday, South again struggled for a good start as the Zimbabwe side got a superb start.

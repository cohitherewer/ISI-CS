The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachins presence makes a difference, says Dhoni
                                                     Sachins presence makes a difference, says Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT              Ishant Sharma during training on Monday, the eve of Indias first ODI against New Zealand in Napier. (Reuters)                      
	Napier: Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Monday said that Sachin Tendulkars return to the side was a major boost to the teams morale ahead of the one-day series.         
	According to Dhoni, the batting maestro makes an amazing amount of contribution to the team with his experience.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Return of Sachin Tendulkar         
	He is a great player. Not only from a batting or bowling point of view but also the amazing amount of contribution he can make to the side with his experience. He changes the dressing room atmosphere completely         
	Sachins influence on the team         
	That is very difficult for me to answer. But when he was playing against us (Chennai Super Kings) for Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League, it played on our minds. The amount of ideas he has got, apart from being a very talented and aggressive cricketer, is phenomenal.         
	The wicket         
	Weve not seen the wicket. But not only the wicket, the dimensions of the field is very important, so thats one of the reasons why we cant announce the XII.         
	Ishant Sharmas injury         
	We are thinking of giving him rest, so that he can be available for the whole series rather than playing him if hes 70 per cent or 80 per cent fit. We will be cautious with him. At times weve given rest to the fast bowlers. So one game wont really make a difference. Its a gamble if you want him to play in the first game. So we can give him some time to recover and let him come back when hes fully fit in the second game.         
	On the confidence level of the team         
	We are confident about each and every game, Even if we have won the last game it doesnt really bother us. We have to start from scratch, we have to do the good things again and again.         
	What India should be careful of on the field?         
	You have to be careful about each and everything you do out on the field.         
	Indias plan against Vettoris bowling         
	Every bowler is important. At the same time if you have other bowlers you can target, theres no problem playing a bowler with extra caution. Weve done that with Mendis when we were not really picking him up. Well see how it goes because the conditions over here dont really help the spinners a lot but at the same time hes a class spinner and he can create problems on any surface.         
	On utilising Sehwag as an off-spinner         
	We have used most of our bowlers when it comes to the 50-over format. You have to be careful when it comes to the Twenty20 because one over can change the game. But we have seen that our part-timers have really contributed a lot not only in the one-dayers but also in the Test matches. So if we need him, he will definitely bowl.         
	The importance of the first game         
	Each and every game is important. If you can win the first game, you get a good start to the series. But I feel it doesnt make much of a difference especially if its a five-match series.         
	On the conditions         
	If you see the conditions, I dont think they are the same when we came here back in 2003 (Last time) It was assisting the seamers a lot. This time they are pretty much favourable for both sides. Whoever plays better cricket will win.         
	How important is it to get used to the conditions         
	Theres a lot of difference when it comes to Tests and one-dayers. Because of the conditions and the ball thats being used. The white ball does a bit for the first 8-10 overs and then it doesnt really assist the fast bowlers. If you see the red ball thats being used, it swings around for 50-55 overs before it stops doing anything and then reverse swing comes into action. Its very different but yes, itll help getting used to the bounce and you can say the conditions.

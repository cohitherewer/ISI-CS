	Ipoh: Captain Sandeep Singhs brace put India ahead before they conceded a late goal to settle for a 2-2 draw against New Zealand in the Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament here Thursday.         
	Richard Pethericks eighth-minute strike put the New Zealanders ahead but Sandeep scored the equaliser in the 27th minute and struck once again in the 48th minute to snatch the lead.         
	For New Zealand, Joseph Barth Holomew sounded the board in the 63rd minute to restore parity.         
	With Malaysia leading the table and New Zealand being Indias main rival for a place in Sundays final, a win Thursday would have come handy for Sandeeps men but they faltered towards the end and could gain just one point from the outing.         
	India and New Zealand both have five points even though Sandeeps men enjoy a superior goal average in the tournament.         
	On a high after their 3-0 win against Malaysia Wednesday, India were in for an early jolt when Richard Petherick found the target in the eighth minute.         
	Stung by the reverse, India made repeated inroads before tasting success in the 27th minute through their captain, which ensured they went into the lemon-break at 1-1.         
	Sandeep was at it again in the second half to put India in the lead, but their perennial tendency to concede late goals showed no signs of relenting. The defence, which withstood many onslaughts, could not see through the last few minutes and wilted before Joseph Barth Holomew to settle for a draw.         
	After a rest day Friday, India play their final league match against archrivals Pakistan on Saturday while New Zealand take on Malaysia.           (PTI)

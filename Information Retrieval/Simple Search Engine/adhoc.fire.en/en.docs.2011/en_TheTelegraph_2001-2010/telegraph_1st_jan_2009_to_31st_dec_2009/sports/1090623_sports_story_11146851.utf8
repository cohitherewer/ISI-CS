The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hope well get to play some home series now: Younis 
                                                   Hope well get to play some home series now: Younis 
            A CORRESPONDENT                            
	London: Pakistan captain Younis Khan spoke to the media after his team won the World Twenty20 at Lords on Sunday.                 
	The following are excerpts         
	Message to other teams after winning the title         
	Everybody follows Twenty20 cricket nowadays and since we are the Twenty20 champions, I hope well get to play some home series now. I am requesting all the teams to come to Pakistan. Everybody knows that the law and order situation is not good, but that is not our fault. We need to play home series to groom youngsters and if there is no cricket in Pakistan, how can we motivate youngsters at school level and college level. There is a message from me and my team to everyone: Please come and play in Pakistan. I am proud of my nation and this victory will be good for all of us.         
	If he had expected the team would win the title         
	Before the World Cup, I was chatting to the media and I told them there are two or three teams who can reach last four, including Pakistan and the West Indies. Everybody was thinking that Im mad or something. But I knew teams like West Indies and Pakistan have match-winners. I knew that if we play to potential, well reach last four and then well need luck to win the semi-final and final. I think we were lucky, and that is why we won the World Cup.         
	On the controversy over his comments on Twenty20         
	I just said that Twenty20 is a funny game but people misunderstood me. I said it then because we had lost a couple of games and those were only warm-up games. Everyone started saying Pakistan are not a good team and they will not even qualify for the Super Eights. But now we have showed that we are slow starters, but we can turn it on.         
	If his views on the shortest form of the game have changed now         
	I still believe that this is good entertainment and we must do something about this cricket. If you continue promoting Twenty20, then there will be no Test cricket and one-dayers. Im not against Twenty20, but I must say that this cricket is harder than the one-dayers and Tests because in just 20 overs, youll lose a months energy.         
	On his retirement from Twenty20 cricket         
	I am 34 and I think I am too old for this form of cricket. The good thing is that we have a couple of youngsters like Shahzaib Hasan, Ahmed Shehzad and Fawad Alam.         
	On his dream of winning the World Cup         
	It was one my dreams to win this World Cup. We won our last World Cup in 1992 under Imran Khan, and he is my hero. All the time I used to dream about winning the World Cup and thinking why I was not in the 1992 team, but now I am also happy to have won a World Cup.         
	On the loss in the 2007 World Twenty20 final         
	We came very close in 2007. We never thought then that two Asian teams would qualify for the final in South Africa because the condition was not suitable for Asian batsmen. Suddenly, we were in the World Cup final and it was a close match. Again, Im surprised that two Asian teams were again in the World Cup final because we play a different style of cricket.         
	Message to teammates before the match         
	We lost to Australia in the 1999 World Cup final. So this time, me, Shahid (Afridi) and (Abdul) Razzaq talked to the guys and told them this time we need to hold our nerves. It was a surprising innings from Afridi because he was playing on ones and twos. (Umar) Gul was fantastic with the ball and even Afridi did a good job with the ball.         
	If he expects this victory to have an impact on the terrorists, too         
	I hope they listen to me and work for peace. We have seen this is a big problem in countries like India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. It should not happen. It affects sports.         
	If India and Pakistan should resume playing each other         
	India and Pakistan should play each other because players get a lot of motivation from those games. They learn to cope with pressure as well. They also get the chance to become famous if they perform well. Sports should always be kept away from politics.         
	If missing the IPL hurt Pakistan cricketers         
	It was neither the players fault, nor the IPLs (Indian Premier League). At that time, the law and order situation was not good in Pakistan and the government didnt allow the players to take part in the IPL. It is really fantastic that there has been no Twenty20 cricket in Pakistan and still we are the champions.         
	On the preparations         
	I think we had prepared quite well for the last series we played against Australia. We lost that series, but we had played a lot of youngsters in that series. I was focusing a lot on guiding the youngsters in that series and as you saw, I didnt do well then. But in this series, I concentrated on my captaincy and you can see the results.         
	On the lack of consistency         
	The law and order situation is not good. So we dont get to play consistently. How can we be consistent? But thank God, we still have a good team with players like Misbah-ul Haq, Afridi, Gul and myself.

	Melbourne: For two sets it looked like Roger Federers run at a record 14th Grand Slam title was going to be derailed by Tomas Berdych at the Australian Open.         
	Then the 6-foot-5 (1.96-meter) Czech had a meltdown and Federer swooped, recovering for a 4-6, 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 win Sunday  only his fourth career comeback from two sets down - to reach the quarter finals.         
	Novak Djokovic wasnt pushed until he took a 5-0 lead, then had to work all the way for a 6-1, 7-6 (7-1), 6-7 (5-7), 6-2 victory over 2006 runner-up Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus.         
	Djokovics fellow Serb, womens No. 1-ranked Jelena Jankovic, lost in the fourth round, going down in straight sets to 2007 Wimbledon finalist Marion Bartoli in the days first match on Rod Laver Arena. And No. 3 Dinara Safina had a narrow escape, saving match points before fending off another French player, Alize Cornet, in three.         
	A major upset result loomed in the late afternoon when 20th-seeded Berdych was on top for the first two sets, working Federer around with powerful forehands to keep the Swiss star on the defensive.         
	But Federer started finding his range. He got the deciding break in the third set when Berdych, visibly tightening, dropped a 40-0 lead and made unforced errors on three open court volleys.         
	In the fourth set, Berdych recovered from double break point to deuce, and Federer got another break point on a close line call.         
	Berdych wanted to challenge, but no replay was available due to a technical glitch, so the call stood. Berdych argued with the chair umpire to no avail with the crowd breaking out in jeers, then netted a forehand to fall behind for the only break of the set.         
	Federer led 4-0 in the fifth but, serving at 5-2, nervously squandered double match point then double-faulted to give Berdych a break chance.         
	He forced deuce, fired back-to-back aces  the last was No. 20 for the match - then leapt in the air with a big Yes!         
	He next plays No. 8 Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina, who advanced 5-7, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 over No. 19 Marin Cilic of Croatia.         
	Djokovic meets No. 7 Andy Roddick in the quarters after the American ousted No. 21 Tommy Robredo 7-5, 6-1, 6-3.         
	Safina, who was down 5-3 and 40-15 with Cornet serving for the match, rallied to win 6-2, 2-6, 7-5 to reach the Australian Open quarter finals for the first time.         
	Shell next play 187th-ranked Jelena Dokic, a 2000 Wimbledon semi finalist with a career-high No. 4 ranking who is in her first Grand Slam event in three years. The local favorite beat Alisa Kleybanova 7-5, 5-7, 8-6. Kleybanova upset 2008 runner-up Ana Ivanovic in the previous round.

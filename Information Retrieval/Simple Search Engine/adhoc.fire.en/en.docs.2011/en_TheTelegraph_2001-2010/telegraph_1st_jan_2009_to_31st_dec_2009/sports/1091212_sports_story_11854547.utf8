The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Aboline is class apart
                                                                                                                       7                                                                                      Aboline is class apart 
            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: Aboline is expected to be the public rage in the betting when six horses lined up for the 3.15pm event, the 1,600m Casino Royale, Goa, Calcutta 2,000 Guineas, head for the mile marker on Saturday. The betting craze is despite the horses five-month long layoff from the track after winning the Bangalore (summer) Derby. Arjun Mangalorkar has, however, kept the Burden Of Proof-Super Fan son in a racing-fit condition, though purists argue that regular canters and eye-catching gallops dont really supplement an actual race run.          
	The horse, who is in a different league will be ridden by C. Alford.

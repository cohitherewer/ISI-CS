                                                                                                                       7                                      Wasnt wrong to bat first: Stuart Law
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Stuart Law, assistant coach of Sri Lanka, tried hard to defend his teams performance at the press conference after Saturdays play.               
	The following are excerpts         
	If the decision to bat first was wrong         
	We came here full of confidence, full of aggression, wanting to make a statement. The best way to do that is to win the toss, bat first, put a total on the board. Yes, we didnt make as many as we could, but Sehwag can play that type of innings even on a seaming wicket. I dont think we made the wrong decision. Sehwag made the difference         
	Dilshan getting another bad decision         
	We sit in the dressing room, we have the luxury of technology. But theres no point blaming that decision. We havent played as well as we can. India have been all over us.         
	On Sangakkara         
	He is such a tough character; hes been scoring plenty of runs in recent years. Were really proud of him .It shows how much fight there is in the Sri Lankan side.         
	Indias bowling         
	They have a good bowling attack. They have two good seamers who swing the ball conventionally and reverse. Harbhajan Singh has proved he is a pretty handy bowler. Pragyan Ojha is only playing his first couple of games. Conditions are helpful for them         
	Winning in India         
	Australia took a long time to win a series over here as well. So its not just about Sri Lanka. I dont think they are far away from winning a test match here.

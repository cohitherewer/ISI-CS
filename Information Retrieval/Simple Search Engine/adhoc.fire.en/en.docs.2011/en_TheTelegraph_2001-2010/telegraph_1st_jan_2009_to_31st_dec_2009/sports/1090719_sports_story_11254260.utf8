The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Owen strikes on debut 
                                                   Owen strikes on debut 
            Mark Ogden                      
	Michael Owen would be the first to admit that he is no Cristiano Ronaldo, but the Manchester United forward marked his debut in Ronaldos old No. 7 shirt by scoring the winning goal to launch the clubs Far East tour with a victory in Kuala Lumpur.         
	Owen, a free transfer arrival from Newcastle United earlier this month, scored from close range on 85 minutes having started life in United colours as a 60th minute replacement for Wayne Rooney.         
	Twenty four hours after Uniteds four-game tour was marred by the bombings in Jakarta, which led to the club cancelling their planned fixture in the Indonesian capital on Monday, Owen, who was afforded a Ronaldo-like reception by the Malaysian supporters, ensured that his new employers avoided an embarrassing opening to their tour on the pitch with his goal.         
	United will face the Malaysians again on Monday after confirming that they will remain in Kuala Lumpur and Owen is likely to start in the rematch according to manager Sir Alex Ferguson.         
	Ferguson said: Michael was never going to start this game, but I will definitely make changes on Monday and it will be a totally different team that starts.         
	His goal was a typical Michael Owen goal, though. This was only a friendly game and the time to judge will be in the new season, but I am looking for him to score goals for us and Im sure he will give us a good contribution.         
	United, performing for the first time since the Champions League final defeat against Barcelona 52 days ago, began life without Cristiano Ronaldo impressively by racing into an early 2-0 lead against the Malaysians in stifling humidity in Kuala Lumpurs Bukit Jalil Stadium.         
	But an error of judgement by goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar led to Amri Yahyah scoring for the hosts with a speculative lob just before half-time.         
	Van der Sar was replaced by Ben Foster at the interval, but on 52 minutes he allowed Yahyah to sneak in an equaliser.         
	The introduction of Owen on the hour mark prompted a wildly excited and the 29-year-old did not disappoint, scoring the winner five minutes from full-time.         
	United have rejected appeals by Indonesian officials to show defiance in the face of terrorism by going ahead with their planned game in Jakarta on Monday.

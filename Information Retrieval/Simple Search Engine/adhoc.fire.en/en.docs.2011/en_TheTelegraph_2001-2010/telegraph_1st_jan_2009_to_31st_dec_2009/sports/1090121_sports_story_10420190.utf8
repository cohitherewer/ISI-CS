	Melbourne: Melbourne Parks first glimpses of Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal were brief on Tuesday but Serena and Venus Williams both gave full value at the Australian Open with their first round wins.         
	Pre-tournament favourite Murray zipped through to round two in double-quick time when his opponent retired injured.         
	The fourth seed was leading Andrei Pavel 6-2, 3-1 when the Romanian quit after 45 minutes with a back injury that had kept him out of the sport for most of last year.         
	I guess if you want to do well in the tournament, its good to conserve some energy ... hopefully that was a good thing, the Briton said, weighing the pros and cons of his short outing in 37 degree Celsius heat. Next up for him is Marcel Granollers.         
	World No.1 and top seed Nadal took just 32 minutes longer to thrash Belgian Christophe Rochus 6-0, 6-2, 6-2 in the night match.         
	The Spaniard won 83 points to Rochuss 40  including 47 clean winners to seven in a dominant display.         
	I played well, moving the ball very well around the court. The only thing you think is win. It was quick so that was better, he said.         
	Nadal, whose best performance at the Australian Open was when he reached the semi-finals last year, faces Roko Karanusic of Croatia in the next round.         
	Serena cantered through with a 6-3, 6-2 win over Chinas Yuan Meng. The American second seed is seeking a fourth Australian title after winning here in 2003, 2005 and 2007.         
	It was a little hot for me today, she smiled, sipping a drink. It was a case of taking my time, not giving 1,000 per cent, you know?         
	I was getting super thirsty out there  at one stage I had to stop and have a drink of water.         
	Serena was joined in the second round by sister Venus who enjoyed a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Germanys Angelique Kerber.         
	Sixth seed Venus is still seeking a first singles title at Melbourne Park despite having five Wimbledon and two US Open crowns to her name.         
	Yeah, Im in the second round. Definitely was the goal, the reigning Wimbledon champion said. Next up for her is Carla Suarez Navarro.         
	World No.4 Elena Dementieva survived the heat to see off Kristina Barrois. Unbeaten so far this year after picking up titles in Auckland and Sydney, Dementieva beat the German 7-6, 2-6, 6-1.         
	It was a very tough match, especially because of the weather conditions today. Also it was not easy for me to come here after playing so many matches in a row, the blonde Russian said.         
	Im sure I wouldnt have minded one or two extra days before. But those are the kind of days you have to survive. Im just very glad I was able to do it.         
	She will next play Iveta Benesova.         
	Last years mens runner-up Jo-Wilfried Tsonga was on song, beating Juan Monaco 6-4, 6-4, 6-0. I played without pain, he said, referring to a recent back injury. So it was a nice match. Thats it.         
	Former world No.1 Lleyton Hewitt suffered a drawn-out agonising exit from his home Grand Slam when he was beaten 5-7, 6-2, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 by Chilean 13th seed Fernando Gonzalez.         
	It was Hewitts first opening round defeat at the Australian Open since 2002, when he was suffering chicken pox.         
	Finalist at Melbourne Park four years ago, Hewitt slid down the rankings after undergoing hip surgery last August and only returned to competition this month.

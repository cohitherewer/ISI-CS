	Wellington: Pakistan are on the threshold of their first Test victory in 12 matches as New Zealand were struggling at 70 for three at the end of the third day of the second Test at Basin Reserve on Saturday.         
	According to Cricinfo, Mohammed Asif removed three New Zealand batsmen  openers Martin Guptill, Tim McIntosh alongwith Daniel Flynn after Mohammed Yousufs patient 83 enabled Pakistan to set the hosts 405 for victory.         
	Ross Taylor (15) and Peter Fulton (12) were at the crease at the close of the days play.         
	Earlier, the morning session was of a kind Pakistan can really do more with, if only for the element of serenity Yousufs batting instills into an easily-panicked batting order.         
	Pace and spin was hurled at him and he remained unmoved.         
	He was tested by a fairly spirited and energetic assault on his body and head, particularly by Daryl Tuffey.

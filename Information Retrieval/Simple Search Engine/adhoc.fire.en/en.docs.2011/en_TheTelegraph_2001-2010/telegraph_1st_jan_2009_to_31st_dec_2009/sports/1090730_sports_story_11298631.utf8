The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Suspected bookies at Pak hotel 
                                                     Suspected bookies at Pak hotel 
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Younis Khan                           
	Calcutta/Karachi: The spectre of match-fixing reared its ugly head again with an Urdu daily claiming that Pakistani cricketers were approached by bookmakers in Colombo during the recently-concluded Test series in Sri Lanka.         
	The daily said in a report that the Pakistan team management in Sri Lanka had lodged an official complaint with the hotel management in Colombo over the presence of suspected Indian bookmakers on the same floor as the players.         
	The Indian nationals, suspected to be bookmakers from Mumbai, had approached several top Pakistani players in Colombo while staying on the same floor at the Taj Samudra hotel, according to the report.         
	The newspaper quoted Pakistan manager, Yawar Saeed, as confirming the incident.         
	Yes, I had lodged a complaint with the hotel management over the presence of the Indian nationals on the same floor as our team. After that the management changed the floor of our players, Yawar said.         
	An International Cricket Council (ICC) spokesman confirmed that the Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) was aware of the happenings.         
	There is a certain protocol in place. Any concerns will have to be reported to the regional security manager and he will deal with it in the appropriate manner. I can confirm that the ACSU is aware of these reports, the spokesman told The Telegraph.         
	The Pakistan manager said he had acted after receiving complaints from some players that they were being pestered by Indian nationals at the hotel.         
	The Pakistan board is very particular against having suspicious individuals mingling or even being close to the players during home or away tours, Saeed said.         
	Some players also confirmed to the newspaper that the Indian nationals had been calling them up and trying to approach them in their rooms, which is why they complained to their manager.         
	The PCB refused to comment on the reports. It is premature for us to comment. We will wait for the managers report on the whole issue and then make a comment, PCBs chief operating officer, Saleem Altaf, said.         
	The hotel in Colombo was said to be the epicentre of match fixing when Pakistan toured Sri Lanka in 1994 and it featured prominently in the match-fixing investigations carried out by the judicial commission in Pakistan and by the ICC anti-corruption sleuths.         
	During the Justice Malik Qayyum judicial inquiry in Pakistan, which led to a life ban on former captain Salim Malik and fines on five other players in 2000, board officials and some players had confirmed that it was at the same hotel in 1994 that the Indian and Pakistani bookmakers had established links with Pakistani players during a one-day tournament.         
	The Pakistan team will play a five match one-day series against Sri Lanka, starting in Dambulla on Thursday.

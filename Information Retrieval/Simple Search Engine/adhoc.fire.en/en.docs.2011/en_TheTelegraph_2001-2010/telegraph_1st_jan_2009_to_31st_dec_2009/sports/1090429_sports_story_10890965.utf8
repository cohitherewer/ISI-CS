The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Conditions will not be a major worry
                                                   Conditions will not be a major worry
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal right-arm medium pacer Sourav Sarkar believes that the fortnight break from the Kolkata Knight Riders camp will not affect his performance when he returns to South Africa as cover for an injured Anureet Singh.         
	The 24-year old Sarkar was sent back from the KKR camp in Bloemfontein in the second week of April before the start of the second edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Sarkar, clearly excited after getting the call on Tuesday afternoon, said: I never thought that I would be called back. But you know, in big tournaments like this anything can happen and you need to keep your bag and baggage ready. Even when we were sent back, we were told to be ready to return to South Africa whenever the team needed our service. I obviously feel lucky, Sarkar said.         
	I had no information that they would call me back. I came to know about it only when I got a call this afternoon, he added.         
	I dont think I will have any problem in getting accustomed to the conditions there. During my 15-day stay at the camp, I learnt a lot about the conditions and the pitches. I know how to bowl in different conditions.         
	I bowled well in all the practice matches I played and am very optimistic of repeating the same if given a chance And when you have teammates like Sourav Ganguly and Chris Gayle you are always inspired to give off your best, Sarkar said before leaving for Mumbai en route to Johannesburg and Durban on Tuesday evening.         
	All were happy with my performance. Even in the selection match I got four wickets. I am happy that I have at last got the call, Sarkar added.         
	Asked whether he would be under pressure to perform with the Knight Riders struggling in the tournament, Sarkar said: I feel the KKR are going through a bad phase. One good match, and things will surely change for us, he said.

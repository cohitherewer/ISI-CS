    - Goalie saves two in tiebreaker as India u-23 regain SAFF Cup           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya made two spectacular saves as the under-23 team regained the SAFF Cup title for India, defeating the Maldives 3-1 in the tiebreaker, in Dhaka, on Sunday.         
	It was sweet revenge for India as they had been beaten by the Maldives in the 2008 final in Colombo and also in their group league match at the current meet five days ago.         
	The victory was all the more creditable as India were the only team that played their junior side in the eight-nation tournament, where at stake is soccer supremacy in the South Asian region.         
	After the stipulated period and the extra time had ended in goalless at the Bangabandhu Stadium, India proved far superior in the shootout as the lanky Bhattacharya foiled Ahmed Thoriq and Mukhtar Naseer. Ali Ashfaq shot out and substitute Ibrahim Fazal was the only rival player to find the target.         
	For India, all penalty takers, except Nirmal Chetri, were on target. Jeevan Singh was the first to score, followed by Denzil Franco and substitute Subodh Kumar.         
	An elated India coach Sukhwinder Singh said that although India were under pressure in the second-half and the extra time, he never had any doubt about an Indian win.         
	I had full faith in the boys and knew they would deliver the goods.         
	Much has been said about India brining a junior team here, said the coach. But I knew these boys would be eager to prove their mettle. It turned out to be our biggest advantage, he said.         
	Arindam was simply superb. He had a great tournament and was instrumental in the victory. All the boys were in a positive frame of mind and that made all the difference, Sukhwinder said.         
	In 2005, Sukhwinder had been ejected as the national coach in the most unceremonious manner by the All India Football Federation (AIFF), but he was not ready to talk about it on Sunday.         
	Today is a happy day for Indian football. Lets not discuss the past, he commented immediately after the triumph.         
	India were unlucky to suffer an injury scare midway through the second half when Sheikh Jewel Raja collapsed unconscious on the pitch following a tussle for the ball. While a panicky Indian team rushed towards the Dempo midfielder, an ambulance was called in to take Raja to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where he regained consciousness.         
	Raja recovered and gained consciousness at the hospital, said India team manager Dilip Chakrabarty. The doctors took a scan of his head and, thankfully, the report was found all right. He has been discharged.         
	The incident left the Indians deeply disturbed and they could hardly play their natural game after that. For the first time in the match, the Maldives held the upper hand although they could not beat Bhattacharya, who had yet another great day under the bar.         
	Raja again complained of uneasiness in the night, and was admitted to a private hospital. Chakrabarty said: Though there is nothing to worry about, Jewel will be kept under observation in the hospital tonight (Sunday night).         
	India were under pressure in extra time. So much so that Sukhwinder replaced midfielder Baldeep Singh with defender Nirmal Chetri to keep the Maldives in check.         
	India had a slight edge in the initial stages but they failed to reproduce their smooth display of the previous match, against Bangladesh.         
	Although Sukhwinder had promised attacking football, the Indian juniors looked cautious. They played their passes well but were not ready to throw more bodies forward.         
	The first session wasnt the best advertisement for football.         
	Neither team could manage a clear look at the rival goal. While all efforts by Sushil Singh and Balwant Singh ended at the edge of the box, the Maldives fared no better.         
	Striker Ali Ashfaq, adjudged Most Valuable Player, was clearly not in his element.         
	Teams         
	India: Arindam Bhattacharya; Denzil Franco, D. Ravanan, Rowilson Rodrigues and Robert Lalthalma; Joaquim Abranches, Baldeep Singh (Nirmal Chetri, 114), Sheikh Jewel Raja (Subodh Kumar, 65) and Jeevan Singh; Balwant Singh (Jeje Lelpekhlua, 100) and Sushil Singh.         
	The Maldives: Imran Mohammed; Mohammed Umer, Sobah Mohammed, Mohammed Jameel and Asad Abdul Ghanee; Mohammed Arif, Mohammed Shifan (Ashad Ali, 71), Shamveel Ghasim (Ibraheem Fazal, 115) and Mukhtar Naseer; Ali Ashfaq and Ahmed Thoriq.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Too many events this year, says Bacher
                                                     Too many events this year, says Bacher
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Ali Bacher                           
	Johannesburg: Barring a couple of matches, namely South Africa-New Zealand and India-Pakistan, both in Centurion, the Champions Trophy has hardly attracted big crowds.         
	And, of those two matches, the South Africa versus New Zealand one was on Heritage Day (September 24), a public holiday.         
	The reasons for the poor response, I think, are many... First, South Africa has already had a number of major sporting events this year and, then, dont forget this is a period of recession, Dr Ali Bacher, the one-time face of cricket in South Africa, told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Saturday, the former captain and Board supremo added: Weve had the IPL, the Confederations Cup and the British Lions (rugby) tour... Thats a lot over a short time... The Champions Trophy has come after those Big Three, where people have spent money... Theres not too much of it around in recession...         
	The very lukewarm (if not indifferent) response of fans in Johannesburg, in particular, is also being attributed to neighbouring Centurion getting the big-ticket matches, including Mondays final.         
	I understand the recent problem between Cricket South Africa and the (provincial) Gauteng Cricket Board led to Johannesburg having to play second fiddle... The fans havent liked it, Dr Bacher said.         
	Dr Bacher, incidentally, is now the chairman of two companies and an NGO.

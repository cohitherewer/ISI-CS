The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dilip praise for Dhawal
                                                   Dilip praise for Dhawal
                      
	Mumbai: Former chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar Friday hailed Mumbai pacer Dhawal Kulkarnis inclusion in the Test squad for New Zealand as an investment for the future and felt the tour would be a good learning experience for the youngster.         
	Dhawal is an investment for the future just as Ishant Sharma was when we selected him for the England tour in 2007. He did not play a single match there. Dhawals got a high-arm action and the experience would help him, Vengsarkar said while reacting to the 20-year-old right-arm pacers selection.         
	Kulkarni bagged 49 wickets in his debut first-class season, including 42 in the Ranji Trophy, to force his way in.         
	Pointing out that Kulkarni, a product of his academy, was a good choice, Vengsarkar rued the absence of two other top performers who piloted Mumbai to their 38th Ranji Trophy title this season  captain and opener Wasim Jaffer and No.3 batsman Ajinkya Rahane.         
	I feel Ajinkya and Wasim should have been there by the sheer weight of their domestic performances, Vengsarkar said.         
	The 20-year-old Rahane, in his second first-class season, compiled 1089 runs with a double century to boot in the Ranji Trophy. The 30-year-old Jaffer, with an experience of 31 Tests behind him, scored 1260 runs that included a triple hundred.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Injury may see Oram miss IPL
                                                   Injury may see Oram miss IPL
                      
	Wellington: New Zealand all-rounder Jacob Oram said he will pull out of the Indian Premier League (IPL) if a nagging Achilles tendon strain prevents him from playing the domestic State Championship final on Monday.         
	Oram, who represents Chennai Super Kings in the cash-rich league, denied suggestions that he was trying to save himself for the Twenty20 event by not playing in the ongoing Test series against India which the Black caps trail 0-1.         
	I can understand people thinking Im cotton-wooling myself but Ill definitely take myself out (of the IPL) if I dont get through the final, Oram told a New Zealand newspaper.         
	Apart from the India series, the injury has forced him to withdraw from the Central Districts domestic four-day match against Auckland.         
	But the imposing all-rounder said he was hopeful of being fit for the State Championship final against the same side at Lincoln, outside Christchurch.         
	Oram has a $675,000 contract with the Chennai Super Kings, who will open the second edition of the IPL against the Mumbai Indians in Cape Town on April 18. (PTI)

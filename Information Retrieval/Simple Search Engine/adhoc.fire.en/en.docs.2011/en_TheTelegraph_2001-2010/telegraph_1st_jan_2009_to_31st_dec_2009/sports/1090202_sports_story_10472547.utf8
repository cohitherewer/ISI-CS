The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC clears Yuvraj of charge
                                                   ICC clears Yuvraj of charge
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Dubai: Yuvraj Singh was cleared of the charge of breaching the International Cricket Council (ICC) code of conduct following a hearing in Colombo Sunday.         
	According to information forwarded by the ICC the left-hander had been charged under Level 1.3 of the code, which refers to showing dissent at an umpires decision. But at the hearing, Match Referee Chris Broad cleared him of the charge.         
	Yuvraj was given out leg before wicket off Nuwan Kulasekara in Saturdays second ODI between India and Sri Lanka and the Indian stood at the crease for a few seconds before leaving. The incident was reported by on-field umpires Brian Jerling and Gamini Silva as well as third umpire Kumar Dharmasena.         
	After reviewing video evidence of the incident, I am of the opinion that there was no conclusive evidence that Yuvraj showed dissent at the decision, Broad said.         
	He did stay at the crease but the delay in departing was not excessive and I felt he showed a level of disappointment rather than dissent, he added. Apart from Yuvraj and the three umpires, India coach Gary Kirsten and team manager Prakash Dixit were also present at the hearing.

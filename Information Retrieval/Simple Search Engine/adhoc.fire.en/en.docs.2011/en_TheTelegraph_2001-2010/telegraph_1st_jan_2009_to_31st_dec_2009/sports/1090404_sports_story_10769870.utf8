	Miami: Serena Williams retained the No. 1 world ranking by beating sister Venus 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in the semi-finals of the Sony Ericsson Open on Thursday.         
	Serenas opponent Saturday will be 19-year-old Victoria Azarenka of Belarus, who beat 2006 champion Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-3, 2-6, 7-5.         
	Azarenka became ill with a stomach complaint before losing a fourth-round match against Williams at the Australian Open in January.         
	This was the 20th meeting between the sisters  Serena and Venus  and each has won 10 times.         
	Serena needed to reach the final to retain the top ranking she has held since February 2. Otherwise she would have been supplanted next week by No. 2-ranked Dinara Safina of Russia.         
	Im excited, Serena said. I was thinking Id love to remain No. 1. I think I was more happy about that than winning the match.         
	Serena jumped to a 4-1 lead in the final set against her older sister and broke serve for the sixth time in the final game.         
	When she closed out her victory, she hopped in delight, raised a fist and shouted Yes! She then met her sister at the net with a handshake and slap on the back.         
	As often happens, Williams vs Williams was an aesthetic disappointment. Both players repeatedly went for winners, which resulted in many errors and few long rallies. Fans were subdued, with the majority heading back to the mainland by the third set.         
	With Venus serving at 3-5, Serena hit a backhand winner and punched the air, then repeated the sequence five points later to reach match point.         
	Serena won 82 points, Venus 81. Serena had 38 unforced errors,         
	Venus 40. Serena hit 19 winners, Venus 22.         
	One big difference: Venus twice double-faulted on break point.         
	Even though shes my sister, Im still here to win, Venus said.         
	I cant give anyone anything. So Im disappointed that I lost tonight, whether or not she kept the ranking or not.         
	It was a well-fought match, she said. My serve wasnt going as well as I wanted. But she brought a lot of balls back and played tough. Serena is seeking her sixth Key Biscayne title, which would break the record she shares with Steffi Graf.         
	Shes 52-5 in the event, with one loss since 2001  to Venus.         
	Meanwhile, top-ranked Rafael Nadal lost in the mens quarter finals to 20-year-old Argentine Juan Martin del Potro, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (3).         
	The upset delighted a partisan crowd that included many transplants from Argentina.         
	Wonderful for the crowd, top-ranked Nadal said. Terrible for me.         
	Del Potro had lost all nine sets in their four previous matches, but he was buoyed by a home-court advantage, with many transplanted Argentines in the crowd singing Del-Po between points.         
	The No. 6-seeded del Potros opponent on Friday will be No. 4 Andy Murray of Britain, who beat No. 8 Fernando Verdasco 6-1, 6-2.         
	Murray broke serve five times and saved seven of eight break points against him.         
	Nadal was up two breaks in the final set at 3-love, but del Potro climbed back into the match by winning 12 of the next 14 points.         
	I beat the No. 1, del Potro said. If you dont play unbelievable, you cannot beat him.         
	I didnt play well during this tournament, Nadal said. I didnt adapt well. I played really bad.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murali should play till he cant give his best
                                                                                                                       7                                        Murali should play till he cant give his best
  - Difficult for Sri Lanka to square series: Dav Whatmore       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Dav Whatmore                                 
	Calcutta: Outside the family, perhaps few know Muttiah Muralidharan as well as Dav Whatmore, who worked with him during his years with the Sri Lankan national team and at Lancashire.         
	Indeed, international crickets most successful bowler (788 wickets in Tests, 512 in ODIs) owes a bit, at least, to Whatmore, the Colombo-born Australian who is now coaching the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	Look, no coach can say hes played a significant role in shaping the career of any cricketer and, so, I cant claim to have done lots for Murali... But, yes, I supported him at a difficult time in his career (1995-96) and did whatever else was in my hands, Whatmore told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking in his suite at the ITC Sonar, on Tuesday afternoon, Whatmore added: I know Murali likes to make an impact and, thus far, he hasnt been able to do so (a mere five wickets in the first two Tests of the ongoing series)... That, probably, has left him a little frustrated... His standards are so high...         
	Reacting specifically to Murali saying that he may quit all forms of cricket even before the 2011 World Cup, Whatmore said: Only Murali knows what his inner feelings actually are... My advice to him would be to keep doing his best and to give it away when he cant give his best... It will, eventually, be a personal decision.         
	Murali, who is 37, has been playing international cricket for over 17 years and his body has seen much wear and tear. That, of course, is par for the course.         
	Traditionally, the Indians play spin very well... In fact, when I was the coach, wed look to attack India with pace... Murali is up against quality batsmen and hasnt got help from the wickets either, Whatmore added.         
	Whatmore felt it would be difficult for Sri Lanka to win the final Test, in Mumbai from Wednesday, and square the series.         
	Its not that this Sri Lankan team cant win, but its going to be difficult... After the first few days (in Motera), the momentum has shifted dramatically and its with India... In a short series, theres little time to recover, is how he put it.         
	The Brabourne Stadium wicket, though, should be quite different to the ones which were offered in the first two Tests  Motera and Kanpur.         
	Mumbai, I suppose, will have more life and I certainly wouldnt play three spinners (the Sri Lankans tactic in the second Test), Whatmore maintained.         
	Asked what made the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-captained Team India special, Whatmore replied grinning: It has a number of hard nuts, isnt it? Also, the players are in form and Ive been particularly impressed with Gautam Gambhir... He looks special.         
	Gambhir wont, however, be in action at the Brabourne.         
	Whatmore, who is based in Mumbai, informed that he would definitely try and meet Ajantha Mendis and Angelo Matthews later this week.         
	Both Knights are in the Sri Lankan squad.         
	Ill, at least, shake hands with them and introduce myself as the new (Knight Riders) coach, Whatmore quipped.         
	Having plotted Sri Lankas 1996 World Cup win, Whatmore doesnt have to introduce himself, but still...         
	Incidentally, Murali isnt the only one in the touring party with whom Whatmore has shared the dressing room. The list includes captain Kumar Sangakkara, former captain Mahela Jayawardene, Tillekaratne Dilshan, Prasanna Jayawardene and Dilhara Fernando.         
	Whatmores second and last stint with Sri Lanka had ended with the 2003 World Cup.

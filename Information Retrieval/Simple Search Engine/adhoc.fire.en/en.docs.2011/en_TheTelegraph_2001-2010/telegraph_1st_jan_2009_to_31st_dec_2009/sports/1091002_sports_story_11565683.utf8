                                                     Mahendra Singh Dhoni prefers team to awards
    - 3 feathers in India captains cap; Gambhir best in Tests           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni                                 
	Johannesburg: As captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni has had a disastrous 2009 in ICC-conducted tournaments, but that didnt stop the selection panel from choosing him to lead the ICCs Test and ODI Teams of the Year.         
	If that wasnt all, Dhoni was adjudged the ODI Player for 2008-09. He wasnt, of course, present at the Sandton Convention Centre to receive the award in person as hed decided not to desert his team on the flight back home.         
	Barring a few players, the rest left late on Thursday.         
	How can I, as the captain, say you all go and Ill stay back for the ICC Awards? So, I wont be there in the evening, Dhoni told The Telegraph in the lead up to the function, which came less than 24 hours after Indias first-round exit from the Champions Trophy.         
	One Indian who collected his award in person was an emotional Gautam Gambhir, named as the Test Player for 2008-09.               
	The following, meanwhile, are excerpts from what the winners (in order of the presentations) said:                                           The recipients of the ICC annual awards in Johannesburg on Thursday: ( From top ) Gautam Gambhir (India, Test Player of the Year), Mitchell Johnson (Australia, Cricketer of the Year), Peter Siddle (Australia, Emerging Player) and Daniel Vettori,  (Spirit of Cricket Award on behalf of New Zealand). (AP)      
	PETER SIDDLE (Emerging Player, Australia): It has been an amazing year... Making my Test debut in India last season, getting to play with Ricky Ponting and Matthew Hayden was like a dream come true... There are no big targets, just performing well and staying fit.         
	DANIEL VETTORI (Spirit of Cricket Award on behalf of the New Zealand team): Im not sure what the award means, but its important for players to understand whats right and wrong... We play cricket in the right spirit... Its a legacy of (predecessor) Stephen Fleming... Generally, its a New Zealand way and often its a criticism that were a little bit too nice... Id much rather win the Champions Trophy!         
	WILLIAM PORTERFIELD (Associate Player, Ireland): It has been a fantastic year for our cricket and this is a massive award for me... Getting to play more ODIs and T20 Internationals is what were looking forward to... Test cricket is a step further (than those forms).         
	TILLEKARATNE DILSHAN (T20 International Performance, Sri Lanka): Its great to have got the award from Yuvraj Singh... I feel proud that a shot  the Dil-Scoop  is named after me... It was after practising with tennis balls that I tried it in this years IPL... Then in the World T20... I have the confidence to play it under pressure... Opening the innings has changed my career.         
	Note: Dilshan got the award for his superb 96 not out (57 balls) in the World T20 semi-final against the West Indies.         
	ALEEM DAR (No.1 Umpire): I thank Almighty God and my parents... One has to be calm and cool after making a mistake... I play table tennis with my kids, that helps my eyesight... I play club cricket in Pakistan and am also a regular at the gym... All that helps... Its important to be consistent... I dedicate this award to my father, who passed away four months ago, and to Azhar Zaidi.         
	GAUTAM GAMBHIR (Test Player, India): Ive had a dream run and life has changed fast... Around a year ago, I wasnt even in the Test team... Every innings is special, but none more so than when I batted for 10-and-a-half hours in Napier this year... Im looking forward to the season ahead and Im looking to improve... Its important to keep the countrys flag flying high... Id like to dedicate this award to my family for all their support.         
	CLAIRE TAYLOR (Womens Cricketer, England): Winning the one-day World Cup was special... It has really been an amazing past few months. The challenge is to get better individually and as a team.         
	MITCHELL JOHNSON (Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for the Cricketer of the Year, Australia): Im just very excited... Im blown away... Id like to thank teammates, family and friends... Also my fiancee, Jessica, who has put up with the ups and downs... There have been a few highlights in this period and getting a Test hundred (in South Africa) was special...         
	Note: Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni won the ODI Player award. The qualification period was over 12 months from August 2008.

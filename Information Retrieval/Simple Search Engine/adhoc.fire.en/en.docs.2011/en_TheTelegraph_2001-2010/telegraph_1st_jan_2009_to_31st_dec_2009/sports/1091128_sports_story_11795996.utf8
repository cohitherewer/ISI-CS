The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Praise, caution for Sreesanth
                                                                                                                       7                                      Praise, caution for Sreesanth
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Kanpur: Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, at the press conference, praised Man of the Match Sreesanth for his reverse swing and said that he hoped that the Kerala speedster has mellowed down for the better.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Indias century of Test wins         
	It is definitely an honour to have led India to their 100th Test win. It is a matter of great pride for all of us.         
	On the chance of going atop the Test rankings after the series         
	I have never really given much importance to rankings. For me, the most important thing is performing consistently.         
	If he was lucky with the coin         
	Definitely, it was a good toss to win. The best time to bat were the first two days. I would also like to mention that our spinners actually didnt get much help from the wicket but still did a good job.         
	The reverse swing factor         
	With the outfield being rough, there was a chance of reverse swing. Sreesanth proved us right when he started to get the old ball reverse. It was a brilliant performance from Sreesanth.         
	On Sreesanths dream comeback         
	It was a tremendous effort considering that this was not an ideal wicket for fast bowling.         
	It was a result of his effort that put pressure on the batsmen. The best part was the consistency he showed in bowling wicket-taking deliveries.         
	The Ishant-Sreesanth dilemma         
	Definitely the reverse swing factor was in mind while opting for Sreesanth in the playing eleven.         
	The fear of Sreesanth bumping into Match Referees         
	I hope that he (Sreesanth) has changed. Unless he crosses the line, I have no problems. If he does, then its a problem for one and all  for me, for the Match Referee and for the team.         
	Pragyan Ojhas debut show         
	He was very impressive. He did exceedingly well as he tied up one end.         
	If he was surprised with the Lankan surrender         
	I wouldnt like to believe that they surrendered. Once we posted a big total, it was always going to be difficult to survive for three days on this kind of a track.         
	On playing as a cohesive unit         
	It is a process that takes time. We are gradually improving. Credit should be given to Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir as they have more often than not laid the foundation for victory.         
	Gambhirs absence in Mumbai         
	Gambhirs absence will definitely be felt. There are times when you have to accept certain situations. I hope that the person who replaces Gambhir does well.         
	Whether he had any difficulty in keeping for such a long time         
	My joints have become loose after keeping for close to 150 overs!

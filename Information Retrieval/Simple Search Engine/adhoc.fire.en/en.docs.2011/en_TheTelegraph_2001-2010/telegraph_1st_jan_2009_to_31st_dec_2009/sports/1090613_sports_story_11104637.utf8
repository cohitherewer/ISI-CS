The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Coach Arthur wary of the West Indies
                                                   Coach Arthur wary of the West Indies
            OUR BUREAU                      
	South Africa are yet to lose a match in the second edition of World T20 but it seems Mickey Arthur is not reading too much into their early success because the Proteas coach described the West Indies as dangerous opponents ahead of Saturdays Group E Super 8 encounter.         
	The West Indies have played both very ordinary cricket and fantastic cricket during their stay in England and we will have to be very wary of them, Arthur commented.         
	You can never be sure which West Indies team is going to pitch up but we must make sure that we rock up with the same intensity we have shown throughout the tournament.         
	Gayle is a particularly dangerous opponent and he has done well against us in the past. We will be giving a lot of thought to our tactics against him, Arthur added.         
	The presence of a left-arm swing bowler, in Warne Parnell, and the in-form Roelof van der Merwe could prove to be the Proteas trump cards against the Windies, especially the marauding Gayle.         
	Although Arthur refused to speculate on what Group E teams might make the semis, he picked Sri Lanka and New Zealand as the Group F teams to watch out for.         
	Of the teams in the other section (Group F) I like the look of Sri Lanka and New Zealand. Sri Lanka have a balanced and varied attack. Their batting may lack a bit of depth but their top four players are high quality batsmen. New Zealand are a team of scrappers. They have a good record in ICC tournaments and should not be under-estimated.         
	Meanwhile, the Proteas captain Graeme Smith wants the ICC to clarify whether England bowler Stuart Broads actions are in keeping with the spirit of the game.         
	Halfway into his run up, Broad has, on several occasions, looked away. He repeated the gesture in Thursdays match. I dont know what the rules stipulate. The match referee and the umpires need to discuss that. Whether it is in the spirit of the game is tough to say. Bowlers are trying to find different angles in terms of getting an edge, but its probably best if we leave Stuart to answer that one (if it is fair). It needs clarification, Smith said.

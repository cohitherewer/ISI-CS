	The venues where the matches would be held in the three host nations  India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka  would be inspected in October/November, the organising committee decided.         
	Tournament director Ratnakar Shetty said the meeting was a productive one and the organisers were operating at a brisk pace to make it a great success.         
	This was another productive meeting and we have continued to make real progress.         
	We are operating at full steam for what should be a great event in 2011 and there is a great spirit of co-operation among the hosts and the ICC, he said.         
	The operational plan and event budget were also approved at the meeting.         
	The recommendations of the meeting will now be communicated to the ICC finance committee and ICC Board for consideration.         
	The meeting was a routine gathering to discuss details relating to the staging of the event, it said, adding the next meeting would be held in Mumbai on November 9.         
	ICC principal advisor I.S. Bindra, ICC general manager (commercial) Campbell Jamieson, BCCI president Shashank Manohar, secretary N. Srinivasan and treasurer M.P. Pandove were also among those who attended the meeting.

	Calcutta: India opener Gautam Gambhir regained the No. 1 spot but Sachin Tendulkar and V.V.S. Laxman lost ground in the Reliance Mobile ICC Player Rankings for Test batsmen.         
	According to the International Cricket Council (ICC) release on Sunday, Gambhirs knock of 167 runs against Sri Lanka in the second Test in Kanpur, has helped him to return to the No. 1 spot.         
	Gambhirs leap has pushed the Sri Lankan duo of Mahela Jayawardene and Sangkkara into second and third positions respectively. In the bowlers list, Sri Lankas Muttiah Muralidharan has dropped to third position.         
	The 37-year-old from Kandy, had slipped from the top of the ladder for the first time in three years and now trails No. 1 ranked Dale Steyn of South Africa by 130 points. Meanwhile, in the team championship table, India are just a victory away from finishing 2009 in No. 1 position. If Mahendra Singh Dhonis men beat Sri Lanka in the third and final Test in Mumbai, they would leapfrog South Africa and Sri Lanka into top position.

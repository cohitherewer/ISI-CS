The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Delaying tactics are fine: Hauritz
                                                   Delaying tactics are fine: Hauritz
                      
	Cardiff: Nathan Hauritz found nothing wrong in Englands delaying tactics on the final day of the first Ashes Test, and the Australian spinner said he would have done the same in a similar situation.         
	At the end of the day, they had to last, they had to survive the last 60-odd balls and they spaced out their allotted amount of overs, said Hauritz. His view contradicts his captain Ricky Ponting.         
	People could say that we were rushing through our overs to get more balls at them. So I dont think anything has been made out of it at all by us, he reasoned. Its dead and buried. Its just part of the game and were just focusing on Lords at the moment.         
	It was a remarkable rearguard defiance by the tail-enders as the last England pair of James Anderson and Monty Panesar batted out the last 40 minutes to salvage an unlikely draw. During this period, England sent in 12th man Bilal Shafayat and physio Steve McCaig, and it looked clearly like a delaying tactics.         
	Hauritz, however, was convinced he, too, would have done the same in such a situation. I know if it was me in that situation, I wouldnt be facing up as quick every ball because its an extremely nervous situation and that one wicket determines a 1-0 or a 0-0 scoreline, Hauritz said.         
	They did their job. Its part of the game, he added.         
	Asked if he felt England had breached the spirit of the game in Cardiff, Hauritz said: Definitely not. (PTI)

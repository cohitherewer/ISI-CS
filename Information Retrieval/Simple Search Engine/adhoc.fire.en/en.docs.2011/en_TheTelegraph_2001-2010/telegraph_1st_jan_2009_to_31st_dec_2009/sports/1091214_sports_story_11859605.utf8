The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Caddie had no clue about infidelities
                                                                                                                       7                                        Caddie had no clue about infidelities
                  Tiger Woods and caddie Steve Williams                     
	Wellington: Tiger Woodss caddie Steve Williams has broken his silence on the controversy engulfing the worlds top golfer, saying any affairs were away from the tour, a New Zealand newspaper said Sunday.         
	Williams, a New Zealander, denied any knowledge of the extra-marital affairs of Woods.         
	I am an honest person. I had no knowledge of what was going on. If I had, I would have said it, he was quoted as saying.         
	Williams said he was angry that a prominent sports writer in the US had called for the caddie to be sacked because it was hard to believe the affairs could have gone on without his help or knowledge.         
	Williams told the newspaper he had no knowledge of Woodss list of lovers and any indiscretions happened while he himself was back with family in New Zealand.         
	What people fail to realise is I (just) work for Tiger Woods, Williams said.         
	I live in New Zealand, I travel to and from New Zealand to caddie for Woods. I am not with him 24/7. Whilst I am a very good friend of his... I dont know what he does off the course.         
	Some nights we go to dinner. His indiscretions have probably been (when he wasnt playing).         
	When he is not competing, I am back in New Zealand. I have no knowledge of what he is doing.         
	Woods, who has been linked to more than 10 women, admitted Friday to cheating on wife Elin Nordegren and announced he was taking an indefinite break from professional golf. Williams said Woods had admitted to him he had a problem and that the decision to take a break to try save his marriage did not surprise him.         
	Tiger just said he needs a break and I dont want to put any pressure on the guy, he said.         
	He will know in his mind, and his family will know in their mind, when it is the right time for him to return to playing golf.         
	He will have the right people counselling him and between the people that counsel him, his wife and his immediate friends, when he is ready to come back he will be ready to come back.         
	Williams said if he were ever axed by Woods, it would be the end of his career as a caddie.         
	I have always stated that my last caddie job will be for Tiger, Williams said.         
	I am committed to him. I understand he needs a break to sort his personal stuff out. (AFP)

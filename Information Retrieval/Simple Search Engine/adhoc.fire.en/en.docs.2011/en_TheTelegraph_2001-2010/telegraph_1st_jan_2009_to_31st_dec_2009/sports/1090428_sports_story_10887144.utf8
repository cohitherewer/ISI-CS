The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Even today, I dont take my place for granted: Sanath
                                                     Even today, I dont take my place for granted: Sanath
    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL Iconic Lankan, about to complete 20 years at the top, on opening           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sanath Jayasuriya                                 
	Port Elizabeth: Sachin Tendulkar is international crickets senior-most pro, but his Mumbai Indians teammate Sanath Jayasuriya made his first appearance for Sri Lanka just weeks after Sachins. So he too isnt far off from completing 20 years at the top.         
	A champion bat (6,973 runs in Tests and 13,151 in ODIs), the 39-year-old Sanath has few peers. The Matara Blaster, who has quit Tests though, spoke to The Telegraph at the Garden Court here on Sunday evening.               
	The following are excerpts               
	What goes into the making of a quality opener?         
	(Grins) Plenty of hard work, the willingness to undergo hours and hours of nets... Concentration... Confidence... Youve got to back yourself against the new ball.                 
	Technique factor         
	Thats there, yes... Ive had to work hard as I wasnt blessed with what some would say a tight technique... I didnt see that as a handicap, though, and worked that much harder... In fact, even after almost 20 years of international cricket, I still work on my technique... Of course, the very basics have to be correct from the beginning.         
	On middle-order batsmen being promoted to open         
	Thats possible, I too started my career in the middle-order... Adjustment is the key and if one can adapt, then whats the harm?         
	Whether his idol had been an opener         
	My hero was Viv Richards, but Id been a big fan of Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes.         
	Favourite openers (alphabetically)         
	Maravan Atapattu: Had such a good technique... I could play my normal game if he was at the other end, because his presence gave such confidence... I didnt have to worry... Maravan knew his strengths and waited for them to be put into play. He had so much patience, which came from mental toughness of a high order.         
	Sunil Gavaskar: Had such class and a presence at the crease... Tight on technique and a confidence-giver to the team.         
	Gordon Greenidge: What an attacking opener! Could hit the ball anywhere... His mental make-up was to attack and attack...         
	Matthew Hayden: Great presence and an attacking approach... Wanted to dominate from the first ball and got his runs at such a fast clip. Backed himself to deliver.         
	Desmond Haynes: I loved his approach, hed demolish bowlers smilingly... Had all the shots and a tighter technique than Greenidge. Also, came across as more relaxed of the two.         
	Virender Sehwag: Another attacking opener and in both versions... The pace at which he scores allows the team to dictate terms... To set the agenda for the match... Once set, Sehwag gets the big ones... His hundreds, in Tests, have come in a few sessions and not in two days...         
	The importance of footwork         
	Footwork is a requirement, but I feel the hand-eye co-ordination is probably more important.         
	Country where opening has been most challenging         
	Look, all countries offer some challenge or the other, but ones biggest test is opening in England in the early part of summer... April-May... Whatever the conditions, once one adjusts, one is bound to enjoy.         
	Message for emerging openers         
	Work hard and enjoy your cricket...         
	What keeps him going?         
	(Grins) Getting into the Sri Lanka team wasnt easy (back in 1989-90)... Even today, I dont take my place for granted in ODIs... The love for cricket has much to do with my continuing to play ODIs and this T20 game... I retired from Tests (in 2007-08) because I thought it was time for Sri Lanka to blood somebody young.         
	Whether hes looking to the 2011 World Cup         
	Cant say that Ill play till then... To do that, Ill have to keep following a process... Staying fit, getting runs and adding value to the team. Lets see how it goes.         
	Finally, getting out for 340, when it seemed he couldve gone for 400, in the 1997-98 Test series against India at home         
	I was destined to get that many only... I wasnt meant to get a 350 or reach 400... Thats how I look at it... Not getting more hasnt been a regret.

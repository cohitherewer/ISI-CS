	London: Pakistan beat the Netherlands by 82 runs at Lords on Tuesday to ensure their passage through to the Super Eight phase at the Twenty20 World Cup.         
	Shahid Afridi took four wickets for just 11 runs and Kamran Akmal had four stumpings and hit 41 as Pakistan bowled out the Dutch for just 93.         
	After losing their opening game against England on Sunday, Pakistan needed to win by at least 24 runs to avoid being eliminated on run rate, but after winning the toss and opting to bat they made 175 for five, with Akmal the highest scorer and captain Younis Khan contributing 36.         
	Despite some hapless fielding by Pakistan, the Netherlands collapsed from 42 from one to 93 all out as Afridi produced a devastating spell of spin bowling to skittle the Dutch middle order.         
	Pakistan made the initial breakthrough in the second over. Darron Reekers struck two consecutive boundaries off Mohammed Aamer, but was bowled off the next ball.         
	The Dutch batsmen rode their luck at times, with a series of sloppy shots, but Pakistans cause wasnt helped by some characteristically poor fielding. Aamer should have had a second wicket, but Salman Butt  Pakistans best fielder  dropped a simple catch from Alexei Kervezee.         
	The momentum shifted toward Pakistan as they took three wickets from two overs. Afridi bowled Bas Zuiderents leg stump and Peter Borren top-edged a sweep to Butt off Saeed Ajmal. Kervezee was then stumped by Akmal off Ajmal and though Afridi missed the chance to run out Tom de Grooth, fumbling the ball at the stumps, he redeemed himself with two wickets from three balls.         
	First he bowled de Grooth, then had Daan van Bunge stumped by Akmal to reduce the Netherlands to 61 for six.         
	The Netherlands then lost their last four wickets for just 31 runs, Pakistan completing the win when Umar Gul bowled Pieter Seelaar.         
	Earlier, the Dutch bowled tightly to limit Pakistan to 175, but Pakistans bowlers, in particular Afridi, made sure that was more than enough.           (AP)

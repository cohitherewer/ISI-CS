The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Safin siblings surge ahead
                                                   Safin siblings surge ahead
    - Federer storms into 3rd round 
  -   Sania out                             
	Melbourne: The Safin siblings surged through the Australian Open draw on Wednesday as womens third seed Dinara and mens former world No.1 Marat cruised into the third round.         
	Marat thundered through to a mouth-watering showdown with second seed Roger Federer after crushing Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 7-5, 6-2, 6-2 while sister Safina, chasing her maiden Grand Slam title, beat fellow Russian Ekaterina Makarova 6-7, 6-3, 6-0.         
	Federer stormed to a 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 victory over Russias Evgeny Korolev.         
	Twice runner-up here and champion in 2005, Safin is eagerly anticipating his clash with the 13-time Grand Slam champion.         
	Im looking forward. I have nothing to worry about. Im going to play my match, said Safin, who beat the Swiss the last time they faced off at the Open in the 2005 semis. We know each other pretty well. He knows how to play against me, I know how to play against him. Unfortunately I didnt win a lot of matches against him, but Im looking forward. Its another chance. I have nothing to lose. Im going to go for it. Whatever comes, comes.         
	Federer was equally keen for the clash even though he holds a commanding 9-2 lead head to head. Its going to be a nice match for sure, he said. We have a history. We have played a few times.         
	Weve played in majors before and played some good matches before... We go way back. Him, of course, being a former No.1, same for me, former Grand Slam champion, its an intriguing match up, he added.         
	Federer and Safin were joined in the winners circle by the Serbian trio of Jelena Jankovic, Ana Ivanovic and mens defending champion Novak Djokovic. Andy Roddick also progressed.         
	Womens top seed Jankovic beat Kirsten Flipkens 6-4, 7-5 and fifth seed Ivanovic beat Italys Alberta Brianti 6-3, 6-2.         
	Shes not an easy opponent. She can be very dangerous, Ivanovic said of her performance against Brianti. There are still some areas I have to work on and improve.         
	I know there is still a lot of room for improvement. So that gives me confidence, added the 21-year-old, a beaten finalist at Melbourne Park last year.         
	Djokovic eased into the third round with a 7-5, 6-1, 6-3 win over Frances Jeremy Chardy. The 21-year-old world No.3 struggled initially against Chardy in an even first set, breaking just once in the 12th game, before he romped away with the second and third.         
	Im playing better and better which is a very encouraging fact for me, Djokovic said. I really stepped it up and played pretty good in the second and third set.         
	Roddick, the last American man to win a Grand Slam title, ousted Belgian qualifier Xavier Malisse 4-6, 6-2, 7-6 6-2. I felt good from the first ball, Roddick said. Credit to him. He came out with a good game plan and he was just going to fire.         
	Argentinas David Nalbandian had no excuses for becoming the highest ranked mens player to be knocked out.         
	I dont think I played bad, but every set I was starting a break down and had to fight from a break down and come back, the 10th seed told reporters after he was beaten 6-4, 5-7, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 by Taiwans Lu Yen-hsun in the second-round. He played, I dont know if it was perfect, but he played at a very good level.         
	The host nation suffered mixed fortunes in the night session on Rod Laver Arena.         
	Australias big hope, 16-year-old Bernard Tomic, was brought down to earth with a 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 defeat by Luxembourgs Gilles Muller. Former world No.4 Jelena Dokovic thrilled a seething mass of green and gold local fans by beating Russian 17th seed Anna Chakvetadze 6-4, 6-7, 6-3.         
	Ive just been really, really focused and really wanted it so bad, the on-again-off-again-on-again Australian said. Things are going really well at the moment.

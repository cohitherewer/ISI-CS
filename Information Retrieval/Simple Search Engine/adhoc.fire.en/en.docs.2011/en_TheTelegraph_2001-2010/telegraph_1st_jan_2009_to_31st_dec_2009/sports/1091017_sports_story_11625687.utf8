The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Should be at our best for Games
                                                     Should be at our best for Games
                    Yuki Bhambri and Somdev Dev Varman                            
	Hockey icon Gurbux Singh, a highly respected columnist, reported in a recent piece that, at an under-18 junior hockey training camp in Bhopal, 50 out of the 55 players, ninety per cent from the Sports Authority of India at that, tested overage! It left me numb with disbelief.         
	Cheating on age is an old feature of junior sport in India. But a ninety per cent strike rate surely puts us on top of the batting league.         
	In the past, weve often joked and laughed about some hardened overage offenders and said they could go straight to the veterans events when they finished with the juniors!         
	It is funny but no laughing matter. Individual cheats are there in all sport, but cheating en masse, where virtually the whole team could well have been overage, is unbelievable. What is most disturbing is that cheating on such a scale could not have been possible without the collusion of the administration.         
	Our efficient and pro-active sports minister M.S. Gill, the high priest of the forthcoming Commonwealth Games  the event that has been likened to a chaotic Indian wedding where we expect things to fall in place on the conjugal night  has much on his plate.         
	Hopefully the minister will find the magic mantra for conjugal bliss and make the Games a spectacular success for India.         
	The government is spending thousands of crores for the Commonwealth Games in developing world class stadiums, civil infrastructure, sporting facilities and making training grants to athletes.         
	These are all tangible assets which, broadly speaking, will make our capital a world class destination, build our image and stimulate sport, trade and tourism. However, the richest harvest will be the intangible one and it can be reaped by successfully projecting to the Commonwealth and the whole world the image of a sporting nation with rich moral values reflecting our great cultural heritage.         
	To ensure that, it must be made abundantly clear to the various sports bodies, officials and participants that there will be zero tolerance for any action that tarnishes our image. Can you imagine 10,000 athletes returning to their countries with a negative opinion of our country?         
	Our legendary hospitality is unmatched worldwide but that will not absolve us from the guilt of poor behaviour on the playing field.         
	In tennis, India has a genuine 17-year-old in the lanky 62 Yuki Bhambri, the sole flag bearer of junior tennis in India.         
	Yukis style of play makes him an exciting prospect. His game has the indelible stamp of the world famous Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy, a foundation that has in the past successfully anchored the games of many of the top players, both women and men.         
	It takes 3/4 years of gestation for juniors to get to their best. During this time Yuki must have a world class physical trainer to furnish his sparse frame with the muscles to achieve the stamina and strength required for the demanding modern game.         
	Equally important is a coach who has guided players to the top level by fine tuning their games and advising them tactically. Thats not all. Participation in tournaments and winning matches is imperative. They are the only steps to higher rankings. Bhambris world No.1 status in the juniors and five consecutive tournament titles in Futures tournaments in India are excellent and impressive credentials.         
	Futures is the lowest rung of the international tennis ladder after which one has the Challengers, where Somdev Dev Varman is now struggling.         
	The Futures tournaments are fiercely competitive. Participants come from all over the world and are driven by an intense hunger for success. Almost everybody is well over 6 feet, physically very strong and ready to lay down their lives for a point. One has to be very tough to move up to the Challenger level. Bhambri has proved his mettle by winning matches and, in the end, that is the only thing that counts.         
	The arrival of Bhambri and Somdev, heralded by some as the dawn of a new era, is the mere flicker of a strobe light in the dark.

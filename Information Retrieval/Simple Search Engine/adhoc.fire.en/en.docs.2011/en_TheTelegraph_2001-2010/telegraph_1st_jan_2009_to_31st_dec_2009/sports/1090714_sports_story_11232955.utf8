The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australian batsmen move up
                                                   Australian batsmen move up
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Australias struggle to get on top of England in the first Ashes Test ultimately proved futile but their batsmens heroics didnt go in vain.         
	The Australian batsmen were all rewarded for their efforts in the latest Test rankings released Monday.         
	Simon Katich, Marcus North and Brad Haddin all scored centuries and, for these efforts, all three batsmen have been promoted in the rankings that are updated after every Test. The defiant Paul Collingwood of England has returned to the top 20 by climbing five places to 19th after scoring two half-centuries in the match, including a gritty 74 in the second innings.         
	Katich, who scored 122, has gone up four places. Marcus North, who struck an unbeaten 125, has rocketed 23 places to 43d position while Haddin, who scored 121, has climbed six places to 30th. Captain Ricky Ponting too has inched towards the top five following his elegant 150 and is now sixth. India spearhead Zaheer Khan gained a place to enter the top 10 at No.10.

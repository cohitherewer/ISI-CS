The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jose Brasa bristles at detractors
                                                                                                                       7                                      Jose Brasa bristles at detractors
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: A day after Rajpal Singh was named the skipper for the Champions Challenge tournament, a confident Spanish coach Jose Brasa said the controversy over captaincy was the creation of a few who did not want the game to progress in India.         
	I simply dont know who spread the rumours about the captaincy issue and resentment in the team and why did they do so. All I can say it was a pack of lies. Do they not want the game to progress in India? asked the Indian coach till the next Asian Games.         
	Brasa, who was publicly snubbed by Hockey India (HI) officials after reports of revolt by a section of the players appeared in the media, seemed to have received a new lease of life after his demands for Rajpal as the captain was accepted.         
	So much so, Brasa claimed there was absolute camaraderie in the team. Rajpal has been appointed the captain after all the coaches agreed to it. All of us have full confidence in Rajpal. We watched him closely during the tour of Canada and he was found totally fit to lead the team, said Brasa.         
	The chief coach said the present bunch of boys were a highly motivated lot, who would do well in the forthcoming World Cup. India are lucky to have such a group of dedicated players, he commented.         
	Brasa, along with the entire team and the support staff, was present during the logo unveiling ceremony for the World Cup. The team would leave for Spain late on Sunday night for a seven-day camp in Madrid before flying off to Argentina to play the Champions Challenge tournament.         
	Skipper Rajpal Singh made it clear the players had no complaints against the coaching style of Brasa as claimed by some insiders in the national camp early this week.         
	The players are happy with the coach, Rajpal said. We have adjusted to his coaching style and progressing very well. The coach has introduced a few things and the team is responding. At the moment, we are concentrating on build up and counter attacks.         
	Asked how he felt after being named the captain twice in a span of one week, Rajpal laughed and said: I only come to know about all these things through the media.

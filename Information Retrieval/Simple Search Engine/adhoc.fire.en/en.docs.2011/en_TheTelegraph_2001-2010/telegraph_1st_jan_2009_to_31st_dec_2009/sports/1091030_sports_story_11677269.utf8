The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI mum on Nagpur episode
                                                   BCCI mum on Nagpur episode
                      
	Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) chose to stay mum on the fracas involving a few India players and photographer before Wednesdays second ODI against Australia at Nagpur.         
	We dont have any plans to talk to the team management. If there is any change in the status, we will let you know, said a BCCI spokesperson when contacted.         
	It was learnt that India youngsters Virat Kohli, Amit Mishra and Praveen Kumar and news photographers had an altercation after the latter complained that the cricketers, who were knocking the ball about near the boundary, could end up damaging their equipment.         
	The players did not heed the photographers request and continued with their practice, much to the consternation of the lensmen who got into a verbal duel at the new VCA Stadium in Jamtha.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I did the right thing: Younis
                                                     I did the right thing: Younis
                  Younis                     
	Karachi: Younis Khan has said a feeling of being betrayed by people in power pushed him into stepping down as the captain of Pakistan.         
	I did the right thing. I have worked very hard to keep this team united for the last eight months, despite problems. So when anyone accuses me or the team of fixing matches, then I have no option but to resign, Younis said in an interview.         
	He said, apart from being hurt by allegations of match fixing, there were some other issues as well that prompted him to hand over his resignation to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ejaz Butt.         
	I dont want to elaborate on them but the last eight months have been tough for me and I have still tried to do my best as captain and player to unite the team, he said.         
	Younis said, after putting in so much effort, it was natural for him to feel upset when fingers were pointed at his decisions and the teams performances. Younis also indicated that he was not satisfied with the boards way of dealing with certain issues concerning the team.         
	I will have a very frank discussion with the chairman of the board, whenever he invites me to discuss my resignation (sources said Butt might call him Thursday), because some issues need to be sorted out, like the term of my captaincy, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Muttahida Quami Movement Wednesday threatened a nation-wide agitation in support of Younis. The MQM said they would stage protests if the PCB accepts his resignation. (PTI)

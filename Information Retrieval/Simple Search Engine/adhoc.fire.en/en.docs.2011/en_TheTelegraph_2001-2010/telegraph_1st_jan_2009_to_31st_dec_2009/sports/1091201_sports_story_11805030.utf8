The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lara all praise for Barath
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lara all praise for Barath
                      
	Port of Spain: Adrian Baraths century in his debut Test at Brisbane proved that the visiting West Indies team should not unnecessarily fear the Australians, batting great Brian Lara said.         
	Speaking at the Australian High Commission here, Lara said the youngster promises to be an interesting career and his 104-run knock in the second innings in the first Test proved there was not much to fear about the Australians.         
	With Adrian Barath scoring runs, a debutant like him should tell the likes of Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Chris Gayle, Ramnaresh Sarwan, if he is back, and Dwayne Bravo that there is not much to be feared in the Australia cricket team, Lara said.         
	The West Indies side, under Chris Gayle, lost the series opener inside three days.         
	Incidentally, it was Lara who had spotted the special talent in Barath at the Queens Park Oval when the youngster was just 11 and took him to watch matches in England in 2007.         
	Dwelling on Baraths century, Lara said, You could see how compact, how solid Barath plays and you could tell that he is going to have a tremendous future. I congratulate him and his family and West Indies cricket for bringing somebody to the fore at this present time, when our cricket has been spiralling in the wrong direction.         
	Lara was speaking at an investiture ceremony where Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd bestowed on him the Order of Australia honour.         
	Lara praised the Australian system of grooming budding talents. (PTI)

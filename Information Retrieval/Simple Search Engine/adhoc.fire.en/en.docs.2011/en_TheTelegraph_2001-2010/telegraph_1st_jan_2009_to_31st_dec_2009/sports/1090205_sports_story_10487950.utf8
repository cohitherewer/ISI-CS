	New Delhi: Recuperating from a hamstring injury that kept him out of the Sri Lanka tour, off-spinner Harbhajan Singh said he is regaining full fitness and is looking forward to spearhead Indias spin attack in New Zealand.         
	My injury has healed considerably. I have resumed training and bowling at nets. I still have enough time before that and I expect to play a part in the New Zealand series, said the spinner, who has recently been conferred with the Padma Shri award.         
	Following veteran leg-spinner Anil Kumbles retirement, Harbhajan is the senior-most bowler in the slow bowling department and the spinner said he was ready to shoulder the responsibility.         
	Whenever Ive played, Ive always taken responsibility. Now, after Anilbhais retirement, I know I have to take the responsibility in New Zealand and I am ready for that, he added.         
	India will leave for New Zealand later this month for a full series there. Despite Harbhajans absence, the Indian team has already clinched the five-match ODI series in Sri Lanka, and Harbhajan felt the batsmen had sorted out Sri Lankas enigmatic spinner Ajantha Mendis.         
	The success in Sri Lanka is a result of team effort. We played great cricket there, specially the batsmen are tackling Muttiah Muralidharan and Ajantha Mendis pretty well. During last years tour, Mendis was no doubt a real threat to India but our batsmen have now sorted him out, Harbhajan said at a promotional here.         
	He also heaped praise on young left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha for his impressive performance in the three matches played so far. The 28-year-old spinner credited self-belief for the teams consistent show in recent times.         
	The present team has self-belief which is the reason behind the teams success. Every player is ready to take challenges and knows how to deal with it. The team now has the self-belief to chase even 350 runs against any side, he said.         
	Harbhajan also lauded Gary Kirsten, saying the coach played a major part in Team Indias success.         
	He (Kirsten) has a big role behind Indias success. Under him, the dressing room environment has become positive. There is always a jovial atmosphere in the dressing room, even in tense situations, he said.

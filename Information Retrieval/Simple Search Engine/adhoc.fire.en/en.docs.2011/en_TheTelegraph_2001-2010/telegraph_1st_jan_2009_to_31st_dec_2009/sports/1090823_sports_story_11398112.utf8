The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rough start for Badoer
                                                     Rough start for Badoer
                  Badoer                     
	Valencia: Luca Badoers dream job of driving for Ferrari got off to a rough start Saturday when Felipe Massas replacement qualified last for the European Grand Prix.         
	The 38-year-old Italian, who has worked as a test driver for Ferrari since his last race for Minardi at Japan a decade ago, was nearly 1.5 seconds off 19th-place Jaime Alguersuaris pace and nearly three seconds slower than Lewis Hamiltons pole position time.         
	Badoers record span of 48 races without registering a point looks set to be extended in Sundays 57-lap race around the Valencia street circuit.         
	Badoer said the poor result was expected. With these difficulties you might think Mamma Mia! but Im happy moving forward from today (Saturday), Badoer said. Its 10 months that I dont drive a Formula One car seriously and this track is new for me and it is very difficult. Our expectation was more or less to do what we did today. I ask you to be patient because I need my time, Im not a robot or superman, Im human. I need just more time.         
	Badoer was called in to replace Massa after seven-time F1 champion Michael Schumacher had to call off his comeback because a neck injury.         
	Despite finishing last, Badoer was calm and relaxed in the Ferrari motor home afterward. I can say I dont like (racing here) and I want to drive my first race in Monza ... but I have no choice, Badoer said. This is the first race. I agree with Ferrari that for me it is just a test.

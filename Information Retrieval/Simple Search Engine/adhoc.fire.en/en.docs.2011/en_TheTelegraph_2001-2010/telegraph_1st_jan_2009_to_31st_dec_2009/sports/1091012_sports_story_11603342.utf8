                                                     Hope springs eternal for Maradonas boys
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Diego Maradona on Saturday                           
	Buenos Aires: It was Saint Palermo to the rescue of Diego Maradonas Argentina in a dramatic World Cup qualifier Saturday.         
	Martin Palermo was at the far post two minutes into stoppage time to turn in a shot by fellow substitute Federico Insua that took a deflection on a Peruvian boot to hand Argentina a 2-1 victory over Peru.         
	Yes, I thought we were out of the World Cup but Id forgotten about Palermo, Saint Palermo, Maradona told reporters.         
	Palermos goal thus keeps Argentinas hopes of reaching next years finals in South Africa alive.         
	Palermo scored from close from a scramble in the final seconds as a driving rain soaked the field at the Monumental stadium, home for Argentine club River Plate.         
	Perus Hernan Rengifo levelled the match with about 20 seconds left in regulation time after Real Madrid striker Gonzalo Higuain put Argentina ahead in the 48th on a sharp-angled shot from six metres.         
	Argentinas future will be settled in Wednesdays final qualifying match at neighbours, and bitter rivals, Uruguay.         
	Were going to go play in Montevideo (Uruguay) with all of our pride, Maradona said.         
	Argentinas victory improved it to 25 points in South American qualifying. Uruguay have 24 after beating Ecuador 2-1 in Quito.         
	The winner on Wednesday will qualify directly for the World Cup. The loser will either be eliminated or face a playoff in November against the No.4 team from North and Central America and the Caribbean.         
	The victory should take some of the pressure off embattled Maradona, who has been blamed for Argentinas struggle to reach South Africa despite fielding many of the worlds best players.         
	Peru, who have never won a match in Argentina, have the worst record in South American qualifying with only two victories in 17 games  and only 10 goals scored.         
	Of the 11 players who started the last qualifier for Argentina  a 0-1 loss to Paraguay  only four started against Peru with Maradona shuffling his line-up  which he has done constantly since taking over a year ago.         
	Argentina pressed from the start and managed a shot after just a few seconds. Most of the play in the first 45 minutes was in Argentinas attacking half with Higuain  in his first match for Argentina  coming close twice.         
	In the 19th Higuain shot just wide from close, and two minutes later he hit the post to the right of Peru keeper Leao Butron. Barcelona striker Lionel Messi was in the mix too, firing just wide in the 40th.         
	Despite the pressure, Argentina seldom looked organised and lacked long spells of possession and continuity.         
	Higuain was one of three players making his debut for Argentina. Defender Emiliano Insua and midfielder Enzo Perez were also playing their first games.         
	When Palermo scored Maradona celebrated as if he had scored the winner himself, diving on the sodden turf at pitchside and gliding several metres on his chest.         
	Go and put and end to this story just as you have so many others, Maradona said he told Palermo, as he sent him into the game in the 48th minute with the game at 0-0.         
	Palermo, who won seven caps in 1999 and his eighth under Maradona in the away defeat to Paraguay last month, had had a chequered career full of highs and lows that has included a broken leg and knee ligament damage.         
	This is incomparable, in the Argentina shirt, a tearful Palermo said. Its destiny, the one above marked me (for this).         
	He gives me that strength and thank God we got the triumph. I was taught never to give up, to learn from the bad moments.

                                                   Fire alarm at the team hotel
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nottingham: A two-minute fire alarm at the Park Plaza (where the Indian team has been staying for a week), on Wednesday afternoon, caused panic.         
	However, it soon transpired that somebody had been smoking in one of the toilets on the 11th floor, which houses the conference rooms.         
	Somebody just violated the rules... We werent confronted with an actual fire situation, a spokesperson for the four-star hotel told The Telegraph.         
	The Park Plaza is largely a non-smoking area.

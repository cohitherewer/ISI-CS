                                                   IPL runs into rough weather
                      
	Johannesburg: The Indian Premier League (IPL) has run into rough weather before its kick-off on April 18 in South Africa over a dispute involving pricing of tickets and hospitality rights for members of the Western Province Cricket Club (WPCC) in Cape Town, the venue of eight matches.         
	A meeting was held recently at the offices of the Western Province Cricket Association (WPCA) in which representatives of Cricket South Africa, WPCA, IPL, WPCC club manager Gerrit Engelbrecht and club chairman Paul Burton met to resolve the problems. A statement issued by Andre Odendaal, chief executive of WPCA, said that the WPCC suite holders would have to give total access to the IPL for using the suites and, in exchange, they would be getting free tickets for the matches.

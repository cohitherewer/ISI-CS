	Bloemfontein: The Kings XI Punjab held their nerves to post their sixth victory in the Indian Premier League here Friday, beating the Delhi DareDevils by six wickets.         
	The win kept alive the Yuvraj Singh-led teams chances of making it to the semi-finals.         
	The Kings XI did not have a good start to their chase of DareDevils below-par score of 120, but Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara (43) and India all-rounder Irfan Pathan (21) shared a 35-run partnership for the fifth wicket to settle the issue.         
	The DareDevils were done in by a great spell of fast bowling from Brett Lee and a disciplined performance by the other Kings XI bowlers. They still had victory in their sights till the 18th over as 30 runs were required of the last three.         
	But Irfan hit two sixes off left-arm pacer Pradeep Sangwan in the 18th over as the target came down to 15 from the last two overs.         
	The 19th over by Sri Lankan all-rounder Farveez Mahroof yielded 13 runs. That put paid to all hopes of a victory for the DareDevils.         
	Sangakkara, who held the innings together, deservedly scored the winning runs, hitting Daniel Vettori for four through the covers.         
	Eariler, Kings XI captain Yuvraj Singhs decision to field first after winning the toss was vindicated as his bowlers restricted the Daredevils to 120 for nine.         
	The pace trio of Lee (3/15), Sreesanth (2/20) and Irfan (2/22) exploited the conditions well and kept the Delhi batsmen quiet for the better part of the innings.         
	With the wicket keeping low and slow, batsmen found it difficult to time the ball and the Kings XI bowlers had a nice time, picking up both the Daredevils openers early and in quick succession.         
	Virender Sehwag, who hit Lee for two sparkling fours between point and cover, was caught at the wicket by Sangakkara after scoring just nine runs in eight balls. Lee aimed one at Sehwags rib cage to send him back to the pavilion.         
	Gautam Gambhir, who has also not been among the runs in this IPL, followed almost immediately, being run out for eight.         
	It brought the red-hot duo of Tillekaratne Dilshan and AB de Villiers to the crease. But this time their partnership could not flourish. De Villiers perished trying to go over the top.         
	Sreesanth (2/20), who went for 11 in his first over, removed the dangerous South African. He holed out to Yuvraj at mid-wicket for 11.         
	Dilshan did not last long either. Once again, the Sreesanth-Yuvraj combine that accounted for the Sri Lankan, who managed just 10 runs off 19 balls.         
	With the top-order back in the hut cheaply, it was left to Dinesh Karthik and Mithun Manhas to rebuild the innings.         
	Karthik, fresh from his blistering late-order charge against the Deccan Chargers, played cautiously, putting a premium on his wicket. The duo concentrated on taking ones and twos in the face of some disciplined bowling.         
	Karthik broke the shackles somewhat, greeting Yuvraj with a six. The duo added 50 runs from 38 balls before Manhas (26 off 25 balls) departed, trying to hit Wilkin Mota over mid-wicket. Sunny Sohal did the rest.         
	That exposed the tail. Lee picked up Mahroof (3) and Rajat Bhatia (0), while Irfan Pathan accounted for Daniel Vettori (1) before dismissing Karthik (32 off 29 balls).         
	The Delhi wicketkeeper tried to give Pathan the charge but could only find Mota.         
	The Kings XI will face the Chennai Super Kings in their next match while the DareDevils will play the Rajasthan Royals.           (PTI)

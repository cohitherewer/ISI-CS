The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karthik, Ishant recalled
                                                                                                                       7                                        Karthik, Ishant recalled
            A STAFF REPORTER            Dinesh Karthik                           
	Calcutta: Fast bowler Ishant Sharma and wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik have been included in the squad for the third and fourth ODIs against Sri Lanka.         
	Virender Sehwag will lead the side after Mahendra Singh Dhoni was banned for two ODIs because of slow over-rate in Nagpur.         
	While Karthik was a natural choice to keep wickets in Dhonis absence, Ishants recall has got a lot to do with the extra pace he generates. Tillekaratne Dilshan has been in ominous form in the series and almost single-handedly took the match away from India in Nagpur during the second one-dayer Friday.         
	The five-member selection committee, which met in Chennai on Saturday, felt that the side needed someone with express pace to fire out Dilshan.         
	 Ishant might just prove to be successful in the circumstances, feel the selectors.         
	Dhoni has been the in-form batsman for India in this series. In the first match, in Rajkot, he promoted himself after a strong start, and scored 72 off 53 balls.                   Ishant Sharma      
	In Nagpur, Dhoni came in at 81 for three and his century was instrumental in Indias utilising the Powerplays and reaching 300.         
	Yuvraj Singh, who missed the first two ODIs, because of a finger injury and flu, has been retained in the team. Sreesanth is yet to regain fitness after testing positive for swine flu.         
	The third one-dayer is scheduled to be played in Cuttack on Monday, while Eden Gardens will host the fourth match on Thursday. The five-match series is currently tied 1-1.         
	The last one-dayer Dhoni missed was in 2007, against South Africa in Ireland, when he was down with a viral.         
	Since he became the ODI captain later that year, Dhoni opted out of the Tests in Sri Lanka, but made sure he was there to play the one-dayers.         
	After becoming the full-time captain, Dhoni has missed just one international, the Napier Test earlier this year, because of a back problem. Sehwag had led in Dhonis absence.

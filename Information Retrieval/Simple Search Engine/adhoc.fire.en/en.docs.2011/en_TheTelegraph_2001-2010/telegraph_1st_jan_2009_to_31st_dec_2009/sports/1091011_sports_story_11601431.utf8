The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Putticks century takes Cobras to Super Eight
                                                   Putticks century takes Cobras to Super Eight
                      
	Hyderabad: Skipper Andrew Puttick (104) hit the first century of the inaugural Champions League as Cape Cobras handed a 54-run mauling to Otago Volts to qualify for the Super Eight stage Saturday.         
	The Group C encounter proved to be a lop-sided affair as Otago were outplayed in all departments of the game at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.         
	Put in to bat, Cobras rattled up a huge 193 for four and then skittled out Otago Volts for 139 in 17.1 overs. Up against a daunting target, Otago never got that big partnership going. Rory Kleinveldt (3/24) and JP Duminy (2/10) were among the wickets to seal the Cobras impressive win.         
	Otago got off to a brisk start as Brendon McCullum (21) and Aaron Redmond (14) raced away to 33 in the fourth over but once the duo separated their innings fell apart.         
	Only Nathan McCullum batted bravely and played a fiery 38 off 21 balls but could not save Otago from defeat. The running between the wickets played a part in Otagos defeat as three of their batsmen, including the explosive Brendon, were run out.         
	Like Brendon McCullum, skipper Craig Cumming (18) also got a good start but ran himself out at crucial stage as his dismissal meant half of the team was back to the pavilion at the score of 79 at the half-way mark.         
	From then on, the writing was clear on the wall for the Otago team. Kleinveldt removed Nathan, Otagos last hope, and then accounted for Ian Butler en route to his three-wicket haul.         
	Earlier, Puttick played a captains knock with an unbeaten 104 to steer Cape Cobras to a mammoth 193 for four.         
	Putticks pyrotechnics with the bat did not spare a single Volts bowler.

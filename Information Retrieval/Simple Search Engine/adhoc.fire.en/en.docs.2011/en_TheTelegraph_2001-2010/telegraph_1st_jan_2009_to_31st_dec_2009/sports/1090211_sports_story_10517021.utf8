The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvi denies pressure 
                                                     Yuvi denies pressure 
                      
	Colombo: The expectations would be sky high but players would not allow the pressure to bog them down when India travel to England to defend the Twenty20 world title, star batsman Yuvraj Singh said.         
	The architect of Indias triumph in the inaugural edition of 2007 ICC World Twenty20, Yuvraj said the pressure of coming in as defending champions would not weigh on his mind or that of his teammates.         
	There is always pressure on defending champions. But our side does not get weighed down by expectations. We just enjoy playing as a team and, generally speaking, our form in Twenty20 cricket has been good, Yuvraj said.         
	India will face Bangladesh and Ireland in the group stages and Yuvraj is happy with the teams for the event scheduled in June.         
	It does seem like a good group. I wouldnt say its an easy group because Twenty20 is a very unpredictable form of the game. Im really looking forward to the event. It should be a good one, the left-hander was quoted as saying by an ICC newsletter.         
	Recalling his sensational form in the 2007 event, Yuvraj said nothing could really match the feeling after winning the title.         
	Winning the World Twenty20 was the pinnacle and nothing can beat that memory or that moment.         
	There were some real highlights, the game against Pakistan in the group stages where the result was decided by the bowl-out and obviously I enjoyed hitting six sixes in an over, he said.

	Centurion: South African openers Graeme Smith and Loots Bosman shared a world record partnership to set up a devastating 84-run victory over England in their T20 international, here on Sunday. Batting first, Proteas scored a whopping 241 for six and England scored 157 for eight in reply.         
	The pair scored at more than 12 runs an over in scoring 170 off 84 balls  the biggest partnership for any wicket in international Twenty20.         
	The huge defeat for England, which came despite the return from injury of Kevin Pietersen, tied the two-match series at 1-1.         
	Captain Smith plundered 88 off 44 balls, his beefy hitting bringing him eight fours and six powerfully-struck sixes.         
	Bosman made 94 from 45 deliveries, with five fours and nine sixes. He fell in the 17th over, hitting the ball off the toe of the bat as he tried to swing Luke Wright over cow corner only to be caught by Denly.

                                                   Bhutia amp; Co. have first feel of Barca
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Bhaichung Bhutias had their first practice session in Barcelona on a bright and sunny Friday afternoon.         
	After a no-show on Thursday, due to heavy rains, Fridays practice session at the Nou Camp complex was a welcome relief.         
	The facilities here are fantastic and the boys enjoyed the session, team manager Pradip Chowdhury said from Barcelona.         
	The Indians are staying very close to the Nou Camp complex. Its walking distance from our hotel. The players are in good mood and the ambience here is so nice that one will find it difficult not to enjoy the stay... Amazing city, Chowdhury said.         
	On Thursday heavens opened up just before we were about to leave for Nou Camp. So we had no other option but have a gym session in the hotel, Chowdhury said.         
	The Indian teams first friendly on June 25 is likely to be against Esportiva Castelldefels, a Tercera Division (the fourth level in Spanish League structure) side of Girona province of Catalonia region.         
	The other three friendlies will be held on July 29, August 1 and 5.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gill assured of title in national rally
                                                   Gill assured of title in national rally
                      
	Durgapur: Team MRFs Gaurav Gill, with co-driver Musa Sherif, with a lead of over one minute virtually annexed the title in the third leg of the Speed-Indian National Rally Championship, sponsored by Bharat Petroleum, on the penultimate day Saturday.         
	With just 1.2 km of Spectator Special Stage to be run on the final day at the Santoshpur Stadium in Calcutta Sunday, Gill is assured of title as he enjoyed an unassailable lead over his closest rival, Amittrajit Ghosh of Red Rooster Racing.         
	I needed this and I am very happy to be back on the track, said the 28-year-old from Delhi after safely bringing home his Mitsubishi Lancer Cedia in the 2000cc N+ category.         
	He further said he was hugely relieved at turning the tide after a string of poor performances in not just the INRC, but also Asia Pacific Rally Championship (APRC) and the Production World Rally Championship (PWRC) in the past season.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | What exile taught Strauss
                                                   What exile taught Strauss
                      
	London: New Zealand was not the first-choice venue for Andrew Strauss to relaunch his England career after he was banished to the wilderness two years ago.         
	Strauss, omitted from the side to tour Sri Lanka in 2007, had planned to play in South Africa. Instead he ended up in the New Zealand North Island town of Hamilton and was playing for Northern Districts when he got a break.         
	Talking to reporters at the launch of his new book Testing Times, last week, Strauss reflected on what had been in effect an enforced sabbatical.         
	It was a chance for me to step back and assess over the last three or four years There were a number of things. One of them was a technical thing but a lot of it was a mindset thing and I think that was the biggest lesson I learned.

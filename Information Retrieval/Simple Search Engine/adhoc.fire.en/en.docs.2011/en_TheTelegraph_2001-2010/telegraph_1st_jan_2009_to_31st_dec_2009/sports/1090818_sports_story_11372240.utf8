	Galle: New Zealands young side will face a stiff challenge when they play a seasoned Sri Lanka team in the Test series starting Tuesday.         
	Sri Lanka are riding high on the back of several recent home victories including a 2-0 series win against Pakistan. The Black Caps played their last Test series four months ago, losing 0-1.         
	Sri Lanka will be boosted by the return of Muralidharan and regular wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene.         
	For New Zealand, Daryl Tuffey returns to the Test side after five years. He had not been considered for selection since 2007 for joining the Indian Cricket League.           (AP)

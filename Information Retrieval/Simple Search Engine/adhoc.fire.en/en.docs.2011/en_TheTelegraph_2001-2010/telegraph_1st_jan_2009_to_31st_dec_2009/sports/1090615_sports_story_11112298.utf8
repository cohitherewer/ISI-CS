	London: Sri Lanka beat Ireland by nine runs in the World Twenty20 on Sunday, but only after Alex Cusack took four wickets in nine balls as the Irish threatened to pull off a major upset at Lords.         
	Cusack took four for 18 from three overs in the Super Eight match, while Boyd Rankin and Kyle McCallan each took two wickets to restrict Sri Lanka to 144 for nine.         
	Only Mahela Jayawardene, whose 78 off 53 balls included one six and nine fours, was impressive with the bat. Sri Lankas next highest scorer was Sanath Jayasuriya, who made 27.         
	Irish openers William Porterfield and Niall Brien made 31 each and John Mooney made an unbeaten 31, but Lasith Malinga took two for 19 and Ajantha Mendis took two for 22 as Ireland collapsed from 87 for one to 135 for seven.         
	After winning the toss and deciding to bat, Sri Lanka failed to make an explosive start, losing Tillekaratne Dilshan off the second ball of the innings as he tried to pull a ball from Rankin and hit it straight up in the air for wicketkeeper Niall Brien to catch. Captain Kumar Sangakkara was the next to fall, again caught by Brien off Trent Johnston in the fourth over. So effectively did Ireland stifle the batsmen that Sri Lanka had made only 28 for two at the end of the Powerplay.         
	Jayasuriya put on 50 with Jayawardene, but by the halfway stage. Sri Lanka had only scored 67.         
	That should have been the cue to accelerate the run rate and Jayawardene hit the first six of the innings in the 11th over.         
	In the next over, the Irish struck again when Jayasuriya was trapped lbw as he tried to sweep McCallan, who struck again in his next over when he had Chamara Silva caught by Rankin.         
	Cusack then took two wickets in the 18th over. Jehan Mubarak became Briens third victim of the innings after miscuing a pull, and Jayawardene was bowled then.         
	In the penultimate over, John Mooney took a superb diving catch to remove Nuwan Kulasekera off Rankin, and with five balls left, Cusack bowled Angelo Mathews.         
	Brien stumped Muralidharan for zero and Cusack was only denied a five-wicket haul  what would have been only the second in international Twenty20 history  when Ajantha Mendis shot just short of Kevin Brien at long off.         
	Ireland needed a decent foundation before the Sri Lankan spinners came on and Niall Brien and Porterfield made 29 without loss before Mendis was introduced in the fifth over from the Nursery End.         
	Sangakkara rotated all his bowlers, including Mendis and Murlidharan, seeking early breakthrough but Ireland still got off to a decent start.         
	Porterfield scored the bulk of the runs, hitting some fine boundaries and Niall playing the second fiddle.         
	Brien was hurt as he dived to make his ground in the sixth over, but continued after a lengthy delay.         
	He clearly needed a runner, but that didnt stop him reverse sweeping Mendis for four an over later. Quick singles were no longer an option, but the 50-run partnership was reached in exactly 50 balls.         
	The breakthrough came when Muralidharan had Porterfield caught behind in the tenth over. The asking rate crept up to nearly 10-an-over, but after four overs without a boundary, Andrew White hit out in the 14th with a six and a four off Kulasekera. But off the fifth ball of the over, he holed out to Sangakkara.         
	In the next over, Briens brother Kevin did likewise to a Mendis delivery and was caught by Dilshan. Three balls later, Nialls hobbling innings was ended when he was fooled by a delivery from Mendis, and was stumped.         
	Johnston managed to clout Mendis for six, but was bowled by Malinga in the 18th over and the same bowler ripped out Andre Bothas off stump with his next ball.         
	Mooney and Cusack caused a flutter, scoring 18 off the penultimate over, but ultimately they fell short as Sri Lankas class gave them the edge.         
	Sri Lanka are now sitting atop the Group F with four points from two wins. They had earlier beaten Pakistan. (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We were outplayed
                                                                                                                       7                                      We were outplayed
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                                  
	Mumbai: Kumar Sangakkara Sunday conceded that Sri Lanka were outplayed by India, but said that the 2-0 margin was not a correct reflection of the teams strength.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On the loss         
	We wanted to try and delay it as long as possible. Once we lost six wickets, the final day was always going to be tough but everyone wanted to fight as long as possible.         
	Sri Lankas performance         
	We were out-batted and out-bowled, mostly out-bowled. We did create chances, but our catching let us down at crucial times. They were always ahead of the game when it came to their batting ...         
	Difference between the two teams         
	In this Test it was Sehwags batting. Dhonis hundred, as well, was influential in putting the final nail in the coffin. Sehwags 293 was definitely the major turning point, because if they had got a lead of less than 50 runs, it would have been a very interesting game, especially going into the fifth day.         
	The 2-0 margin         
	It is a realistic score line, given the way the Indians played and the way we played, especially in the last two Test matches. But we are a better side than what the scoreline suggests.         
	Weak bowling attack         
	The ability to bowl maiden overs is of huge importance. In the second Test, we bowled only five maiden overs. If you cant tie a batsman down for more than an over from one end, it becomes very difficult to exert continuous pressure.         
	On Mahendra Singh Dhoni         
	His main forte is one-day cricket. But he had a big impact in the first game and in this one too. In Test cricket, he has a long way to go, but he does his job when the situation demands. He is a good leader.         
	On Muralidharan         
	He had a problem with the SG ball. He could not get the bounce and the amount of turn he generally gets.

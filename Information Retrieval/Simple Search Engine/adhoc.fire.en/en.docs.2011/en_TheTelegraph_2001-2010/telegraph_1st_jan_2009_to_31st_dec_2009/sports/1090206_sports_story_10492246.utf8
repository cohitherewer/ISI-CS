	Indians are doing a great job now in the cricketing world. I must say that this Indian team is one of the best I have played against. I am sure this team will get more success in the months to come, the 36-year-old spinner said.         
	Muralidharan admitted that Indian stars Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar were difficult to bowl at, but the best batsman hes ever bowled to is the West Indian legend, Brian Lara.         
	There are good numbers of world class batsmen in world cricket today, like Chris Gayle, (Shivnarine) Chanderpaul, (Kevin) Pietersen, Michael Clarke, Ricky Ponting, Sehwag, Dhoni, Sachin. But the batsman who played me convincingly is Brian Lara. He was the best batsman I bowled to, Murali said.

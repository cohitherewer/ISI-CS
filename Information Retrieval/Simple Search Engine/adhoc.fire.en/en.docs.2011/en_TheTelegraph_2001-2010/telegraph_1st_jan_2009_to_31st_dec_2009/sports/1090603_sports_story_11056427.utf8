	 The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) joint secretary Arun Mitra said on Tuesday that the state association would try and accommodate those Bengal players who have severed ties with the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL), in the CAB XI for the upcoming P Sen Trophy. The BCCI announced amnesty for 79 ICL players on Tuesday.      
	If they have a problem with finding clubs at this time of the season, we, on behalf of the CAB, would like to accommodate them in the CAB XI for the P Sen Trophy.       
	But of course, we will have to sort out the matter with the clubs first and see if they are okay with the idea, Mitra said.      
	Meanwhile, Mitra hinted that the P Sen Trophy may be held from June 18-19, provided the weather doesnt play spoilsport and the other tournaments finish on schedule.       
	He also added that the matches of the tournament would be held at three venues  the Eden, Jadavpur University Salt Lake campus ground and the new addition, the James Long ground.      
	Speaking on the Ranadeb Bose-Ashok Dinda spat case, which still remains unresolved, Mitra said that a special committee meeting would be called next week to decide on the issue.          
	 Kalighat put an impressive 370 on the board against Eastern Railways in the CAB two-day league semi-final match at the Eden on Tuesday. Rohan Bannerjee smashed 107, hitting 13 boundaries. Sreevats Goswami notched up 54 off 58 balls while LR Shukla hit 48 off 34.

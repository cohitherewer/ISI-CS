            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: A Manchester United star, preferably Cristiano Ronaldo, will be invited to inaugurate the upcoming All India Football Federation (AIFF) academy in Goa.         
	The high profile English Premier League (EPL) club is set to join hands with the AIFF to bring up the state of the art academy in Cuncolim, Goa. Three senior officials of the club were in the capital last week to discuss the matter with the federation officials.         
	The president of the Goa Football Association (GFA) and the AIFF executive committee member, Joaquim Alemao said on Thursday that the AIFF would soon make an official request to Manchester United to bring the world player of the year for the inauguration.         
	Asked when the academy would be inaugurated, the GFA boss, who is also the urban development minister of Goa, said things should be finalised in the executive committee meeting of the federation on February 19.         
	Alemao is considered the brain behind the ambitious academy. He was instrumental in persuading the Goa government to allot the land to the AIFF.

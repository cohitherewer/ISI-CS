                                                   Fighting Sania falls to Venus
                      
	Charleston: Second-seeded Venus Williams has advanced at the Family Circle Cup with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-2 victory over Sania Mirza of India.         
	It took Williams almost 2 1/2 hours on Wednesday to defeat the 100th-ranked Sania on the green clay of stadium court at the tennis center on Daniel Island. Williams, who won the Family Circle five years ago, is now 3-0 against Sania.         
	In other matches, Melanie Oudin of the US advanced to the third round with a 7-5, 6-0 victory over ninth-seeded Aleksandra Wozniak of Canada, and Anastasia Rodionova of Russia defeated 12th-seeded Bethanie Mattek-Sands of the US 6-2, 6-4.         
	Elena Dementieva, Vera Zvonareva and Nadia Petrova won at the Family Circle Cup on Tuesday, increasing the odds that at least one of the leading Russian seeds should reach the final again.         
	Top-seeded Dementieva won the first 10 games in defeating Julie Ditty of the United States 6-0, 6-2; No. 3 Vera Zvonareva beat Rossana de los Rios of Paraguay 6-3, 6-2; and No. 4 Petrova overcame a mid-match stumble to beat Patricia Mayr of Austria 6-1, 2-6, 6-2.         
	All three Russians have played in the final; Dementieva was runner-up in 2005, Petrova won in 2006, and Zvonareva lost in last years final to Serena Williams. (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Malik dismisses Intikhab criticism
                                                   Malik dismisses Intikhab criticism
                      
	Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik has dismissed allegations that he didnt enjoy the confidence of his teammates which eventually led to his removal from the helm.         
	Malik said as captain he had a high success rate and that there were no issues regarding lack of communication.         
	Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam and manager Yawar Saeed in a confidential report had termed Malik as a loner and aloof who lived in his own small world and didnt communicate with the players.         
	We did not see any meaningful communication between the players and the captain other than his (Maliks) five-minute talk during the team meeting, they had said in their report during the senate hearing of the standing committee on sports on Monday.         
	However, Malik, who was present during the hearing refuted the observations of the coach and manager. The fact is that under my captaincy the team had a 80 per cent win record. The players did respond to me as captain, Malik said.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Symonds to weigh up options
                                                     Symonds to weigh up options
                  Andrew Symonds                     
	Melbourne: Disgraced Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds returned home after being banished from the Twenty20 World Cup in England and said he was still to weigh up his options before divulging his future international career.         
	Symonds, who has been recalled by the Cricket Australia for violating rules by leaving the team hotel without informing anyone, reached Brisbane early on Saturday and said he had a lot to consider at the moment and would interact with media only after he had gathered his thoughts.         
	The 33-year-old met with Cricket Australia head of operations Michael Brown and then read out a statement before being whisked away by his former Queensland Bulls teammate Joe Dawes.         
	Ive got a fair bit to consider I suppose, and I appreciate you all coming out here this morning, (but) I will come out and make a full and proper statement when Ive gathered my thoughts and sat down with friends, Symonds told the media waiting for him at the airport.         
	The controversial player still has one-year contract remaining with the Cricket Australia.         
	CA spokesperson Peter Young said the Board expected Symonds to speak out about his future soon.         
	Its now in Andrews hands what he wants to do. Everyone is waiting to hear what hes thinking and appropriately he wants to take a few days to weigh things up, Young said.         
	Symonds breached his pledge to CA by missing from the team hotel for a late-night drinking session after Australias warm-up match against New Zealand on Tuesday. He headed out again the next morning and had several drinks at a gathering with teammates to watch the telecast of the State of Origin rugby league match, featuring Queensland side.         
	Under the terms of his personally-tailored deal with CA, Symonds was permitted to drink with team-mates in the dressing room after matches and at team hotels. Drinking in public, however, was banned under the agreement. No other player on CAs central contract list is bound by such an agreement.         
	The personal contract was drawn up after Symonds infamous gone-fishing episode last year which resulted in him being ordered home from Australias limited overs series against Bangladesh in Darwin.

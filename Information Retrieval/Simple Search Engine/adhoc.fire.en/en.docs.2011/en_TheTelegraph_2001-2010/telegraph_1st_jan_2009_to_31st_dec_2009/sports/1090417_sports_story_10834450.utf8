The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Missed three key players: Karim
                                                   Missed three key players: Karim
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The absence of three main players from the starting eleven cost the green and maroon brigade dear, according to Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa.         
	We missed three key players  Marcos Pereira, N.S. Manju and Rakesh Masih  in such a crucial match. That was a big blow for us.         
	With Ishfaq (Ahmed) and Rahul (Kumar), we faced difficulty in building up the attack. We could not create enough openings, admitted Karim. At the same time, we dominated the second half but conceded the second goal against the run of play.         
	Karim was of the opinion that the Bagan players did a great job this season. We won the Calcutta League, the Federation Cup and finished runners-up in the I-League. I am proud of the way my team played this season, said the coach.         
	The Moroccan coach stressed on the need of having a bigger pool of players. In developed football playing nations, the clubs have an operation group of at least 25 players, who can be used sparingly. Here, most teams have limited options. Sometimes, the players find themselves overburdened at the end of the season, regretted Karim.

	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) is planning a grand felicitation for Sachin Tendulkar on his completion of 20 years in international cricket.         
	However, the CAB will only organise the function once the renovation of the stadium is complete, according to a media release issued by president Jagmohan Dalmiya.         
	It will be a separate function and not a quickly organised one before or during the break of an international match. In fact, Sachin may also inaugurate the renovated stadium.         
	We are planning a big function Something on the lines of the one we organised to felicitate Sourav Ganguly. We may invite some of the former India captains alongside whom Sachin played and also his teammates.         
	We would try and make the function as innovative and enjoyable as possible, a senior office-bearer of the association said.

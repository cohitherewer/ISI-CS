The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ace cop Sohail, veteran of tours by India, had no role
                                                   Ace cop Sohail, veteran of tours by India, had no role
  - CRICKET rsquo;S 3/3: more questions, few answers
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: One of Pakistans ace police officers, Sohail Khan, whod been hand-picked by Pervez Musharraf to oversee security arrangements during the last two full tours by Team India, was kept out of the picture during Sri Lankas visits this year.         
	One reason for such a strange move, perhaps, could be that Musharraf is no longer in any position of authority. Back in 2004 and in 2006, the no-nonsense-tolerating Musharraf had been both President and the army chief.         
	Usually, tours by Indian cricket teams are accorded the highest protocol in terms of protection. But the last two visits by Sri Lanka (for the ODIs in January and, then, for the Test series which ended with a helicopter evacuation) had been on a par because no other country was willing to tour Pakistan.         
	All the more reason why the experienced Sohail ought to have been doing the security-specific coordination.         
	Informally, Id been involved in the preliminary discussions, but thats it... I wasnt asked to oversee arrangements... Actually, I wasnt even called for a second meeting, Sohail told The Telegraph when contacted on his cellphone.         
	Asked why, Sohail (who is distantly related to the iconic Imran Khan) answered: Thats not for me to try and explain... Yeh sarkari maamla hota hai.         
	Sohail, whod been an SSP till 2006, is now a DIG with the Punjab Police, looking after its Highway Patrolling division. Hes based in provincial capital Lahore.         
	While declining to comment on the lapses which led to crickets 3/3, Sohail did say: Its very sad... What happened shouldnt have happened... We failed to protect a visiting team... Standard procedures are always there... Lets see what the inquiries reveal.         
	[Incidentally, a former commando himself, Musharraf is of the view that the Elite Punjab Police commandos, assigned to the Sri Lanka team, should (ideally) have been able to knock the terrorists down within three seconds. Instead, they themselves got killed and injured.]         
	Both in 2004 (which was a revival visit) and in 2006, Sohail was with Team India from the time the cricketers landed till they departed.         
	In fact, because Sohail had the status of an expert, the Pakistan government had deputed him too to approve the security put in place by New Delhi before Inzamam-ul Haq and Co. came in 2005.         
	I dont claim to be an expert... But, yes, certain things can be picked up by a trained eye... The level of awareness has to be high Often, one also goes by instinct, Sohail pointed out.         
	If only Sri Lanka Cricket had known about Sohail and, taking that forward, requested his involvement with the tours.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Want to end with a win: Muralidharan
                                                                                                                                     Want to end with a win: Muralidharan
                  Muralidharan                       
	Ahmedabad: Sri Lankas Muttiah Muralidharan said that he would like to finish what could be his last Test assignment abroad, by beating India in their den, something which his team is yet to accomplish.         
	The three-Test series between India and Sri Lanka will start on Monday here.         
	I have played enough cricket over the years. This could be my last tour overseas. Sri Lanka has not won a Test series in India, so it would be great if my team won the series this time, Muralidharan, the highest wicket-taker in the world told reporters here Saturday.         
	The legendary off-spinners comments indicated that he will announce his retirement from international cricket soon.         
	Muralidharan said the Sri Lankan team is gradually developing into a solid unit with new youngsters.         
	There are good seamers and spinners. Like Ajantha Mendis, who has improved his bowling since his debut, Muralidharan, who has 783 Test wickets, said.         
	Talking about the advent of the Twenty20 format of the game, Muralidharan said the Indian Premier League (IPL) has proved beneficial for the youngsters. However, they should not focus just on the shorter version.         
	One cannot play only T20. A player has to play the one-dayers, Tests and domestic cricket. Otherwise he will be finished, and his cricket will go down, he said.         
	He said that the shorter version of the game could have proved a stepping stone for many youngsters to show their talent, but its scope was limited.         
	The spin-wizard said playing for the nation surely motivates the players but the financial well being is also a concern for them.         
	If he (player) says that it is only for the game that he plays and not for the financial benefits he gains from it, then he is lying. Every player plays for the love of game, the nation, and also for the financial benefits that come with it, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Sri Lanka captain Kumara Sangakkara is hopeful of his team coming out on top in the series. The guys are relaxing as the pressure is not on us. We do have a balanced side this time, he said. (PTI)

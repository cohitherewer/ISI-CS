The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI, IMG agree on new terms
                                                   BCCI, IMG agree on new terms
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Thursday successfully renegotiated its deal with IMG to run the Indian Premier League (IPL) and came down heavily on the IPL franchises who wrote to the Board protesting the cancellation of the original deal with the US-based event management firm.         
	The house felt that, with regard to the letters written by the franchises, they had no right to interfere in the internal matters of the Board. Such a thing will not be tolerated (in the future), BCCI president Shashank Manohar said after the Boards Annual General Meeting here.         
	Manohar announced that the Board approved the deal with IMG after the latter agreed to reduce its fee to Rs 27 crore a year onwards from the T20 leagues third edition. The Board had paid IMG close to Rs 42 crore for the inaugural edition and Rs 33 crore for the second.         
	On the whereabouts clause of the Wada Code, Manohar dismissed the National Anti-Doping Agency (Nada)s claim that BCCI was yet to respond to a letter it had written on the issue.         
	What is the locus standi of the Nada? They have asked for a copy of the opinion given by legal experts in the country  Fali Nariman, (attorney general of India) Goolam Vahanvati and (former AGI) Soli Sorabjee. The three experts have said that the clause would be invalid and violate the (provisions of) the Indian Constitution, he said.         
	It was decided that the BCCI Corporate Trophy be named after former president Raj Singh Dungarpur .         
	Also, former India skipper Sourav Ganguly was included as a member of the Boards technical committee headed by Sunil Gavaskar.

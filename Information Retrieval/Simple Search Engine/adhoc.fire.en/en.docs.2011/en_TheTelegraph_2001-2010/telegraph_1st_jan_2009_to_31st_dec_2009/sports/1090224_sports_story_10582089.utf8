The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI, ICL talks fail yet again
                                                   BCCI, ICL talks fail yet again
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Monday announced that, following a meeting in Johannesburg, no agreement was reached to end the ongoing dispute between the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Indian Cricket League (ICL).         
	No further discussions are scheduled and, as a result, the ICLs application to be recognised by the ICC as unofficial cricket will go back before the ICC Board at its April meeting in Dubai.         
	The meeting spanned three hours and was attended by ICC president David Morgan and chief executive Haroon Lorgat, BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan, chairman of the Essel Group Subhash Chandra and the ICLs business head Himanshu Mody.         
	An ICC statement quoted Morgan as saying: I am grateful to all parties for coming together with the best of intentions and the discussions took place in a friendly and cordial manner but, unfortunately, we were not able to come to a successful conclusion in our discussions.         
	The ICLs application for approval as unofficial cricket will now go before the ICC board at its April meeting in Dubai. Given the discussions took place without prejudice, no further comment will be made at this time.         
	The BCCIs stand has always been that ICL should disband its league. While confirmation is awaited, such a statement wouldnt be acceptable to the BCCI.         
	This is not the first time that talks between the parties had failed.         
	In October last year, Chandra had telephoned BCCI president Shashank Manohar in New Delhi, some hours after he had returned from the ICC meeting in Dubai. The talks, however, failed.         
	I dont know all the specifics, but I understand the BCCI wants the ICL to be a closed chapter.... That, let me reiterate, is not possible.... Of course, Im unhappy at what happened, ICL chairman Kapil Dev said after the talks failed in October.         
	Morgan made it clear that he wanted a solution to the problem. Ive long regarded it as a priority to bring together the BCCI and the owners of the ICL.         
	I hope we might be successful in coming to a mutually acceptable conclusion. I cant be certain that will be the case but I hope we can at least make a start in bringing about a settlement.         
	I think this is significant because experience tells me that the best opportunity to solve a dispute is to have the parties face-to-face, the ICC president added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Reds owner open to selling stake
                                                   Reds owner open to selling stake
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Liverpool co-owner George Gillett has admitted for the first time he would be open to selling his stake in the club despite insisting the sides finances are on a sounder footing than their Premier League rivals and denying there is a July deadline for a 350million loan to be repaid.         
	Gillett agreed to speak with a representative from supporters union Spirit of Shankly after being confronted by a group of fans in his Liverpool hotel before Sundays 2-0 win over Chelsea which reignited the clubs title challenge.         
	In the meeting, the groups Jay McKenna outlined fans grievances with Gillett and his co-owner Tom Hicks, which the American duo witnessed first hand when hundreds stayed behind at Anfield to demonstrate against their regime.         
	A Spirit of Shankly statement said Gillett expressed surprise to learn of the supporters antipathy but admitted several parties are interested in relieving him of his stake in the club.         
	Gilletts comments on the state of the clubs finances have also further enraged supporters already unimpressed by the Americans.         
	McKenna said: I asked would he, Hicks or both be selling their stakes. He told me he could not speak for Hicks, but said there have been expressions of interest and some negotiation. He could not say who with but admitted he was open to selling, but could not speak for Hicks.         
	McKenna explained to Gillett three areas of unhappiness among the fans concerning their ownership, although the Colorado-based businessman insisted he and Hicks had done their best to uphold Liverpools traditions.

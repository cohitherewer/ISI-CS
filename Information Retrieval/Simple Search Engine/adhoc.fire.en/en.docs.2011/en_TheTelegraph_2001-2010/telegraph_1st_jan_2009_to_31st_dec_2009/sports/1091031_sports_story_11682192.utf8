The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahindra look to roar back 
                                                   Mahindra look to roar back 
                      
	Ludhiana: Mahindra United would be looking to get their campaign back on track with a win away to JCT in the I-League Saturday.         
	Mahindra have dropped points in their last two matches after a sound start to their campaign and cannot afford further slip-ups.         
	Mahindra, who drew their last two matches, will be nearly at full strength Saturday but will be up against a JCT who would be determined to bounce back following their first reversal in last matchs home loss to Dempo.         
	Mahindra coach David Booth was pleased with his teams performance so far but said the manner in which they have conceded goals is a matter of concern.         
	The manner in which we have conceded goals has put pressure on us. Generally, Im happy with the way the boys are playing but there are certain areas which we have to learn to handle better, said Booth whose side are currently third on the league table with nine points.         
	With wins in their opening two matches, JCT with eight points, are fifth in the standings, but the side have failed to maintain the early momentum, picking up just two points from their last three games.

	Calcutta/Karachi: As part of an out-of-court settlement with the ICC on the 2011 World Cup hosting dispute, Pakistan is looking at the possibility of playing a Test and ODI series against India in England next year.         
	Well-placed sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said that ICC president David Morgan, during his talks, assured PCB chairman Ejaz Butt that he would try to convince the BCCI to play a series in England.         
	Morgan made no promises but has assured Pakistan he would use his good offices to try to organise such a series next year, a source said.         
	While BCCI officials said they were unaware of any such development, an ICC spokesman confirmed that discussions were on.         
	Both BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan and chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty said they didnt know anything about the development.         
	India have suspended bilateral cricketing ties with Pakistan since last Novembers Mumbai terror attacks.         
	The proposal is for three Tests, three one-dayers and a couple of Twenty20 matches, the source said.         
	He said Morgan had assured Pakistan he would try to do everything to help them overcome the financial loss caused due to the shifting of the World Cup matches due to security reasons.         
	Pakistan are due to play Australia next year in England apart from a separate series against Andrew Strauss men.         
	If India agree the series could be squeezed in at a time when both teams are free of international commitments, the source said.         
	The source said Butt told Morgan that the PCB would lose nearly $70 million from television rights deal with Dubai-based Ten Sports if India didnt play a bilateral series in Pakistan.         
	When the television rights were sold India were slated to tour Pakistan at least once and maybe twice for Tests and ODIs. And the network has estimated that earnings from those two series alone could be around $70 million such is the pull of Indo-Pak cricket, the source said.         
	The source said as part of the out-of-court settlement over the World Cup dispute, the ICC has also agreed to get a commitment from India that it would make special arrangements for Pakistani players, officials and visitors to travel to the neighbouring country for the World Cup matches.         
	The host agreement signed by the World Cup hosts with the ICC already has a stipulation that securing visas for India would not be a problem.         
	But the ICC has assured Pakistan it would get a special commitment from India in this regard as a lot of Pakistani visitors are expected to go to India for World Cup matches.

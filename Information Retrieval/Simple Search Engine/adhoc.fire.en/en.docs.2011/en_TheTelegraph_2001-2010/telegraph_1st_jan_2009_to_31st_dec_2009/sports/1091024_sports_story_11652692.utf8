                                                     Dhoni hit by Munaf at nets
    - Board secretary says captain will play the first ODI vs australia           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Dhoni                                 
	Vadodara: Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the Team India captain, got hit by a Munaf Patel delivery during Friday afternoons nets at the Reliance Cricket Stadium, but would be fit for Sundays ODI against World Cup and Champions Trophy holders Australia.         
	Confirmation, however, didnt come from the physio, Nitin Patel, but Board secretary N. Srinivasan.         
	Taking refuge behind protocol, Patel declined to provide an update and, instead, suggested that the secretary be contacted. That, of course, was done.         
	Srinivasan, for his part, said: Dont worry... Im telling you that Dhoni is going to lead the team on Sunday... Why worry?         
	Definitely very reassuring, given that the past few months have seen Team India hit hard by injuries.         
	The captain was struck just above the left knee roll and an ice pack was promptly put on the affected area. He was reduced to walking with a limp, but didnt appear to be in too much pain.         
	Meanwhile, Yuvraj Singh, given only an outside chance of being fit for the first of seven ODIs, has been shaping up well. Hed fractured his right little finger in the build up to the Champions Trophy.         
	Well probably first ask Yuvi how he feels before taking a call ourselves... Hes been doing everything without signs of discomfort... Lets see how it goes, a member of the team management told The Telegraph here.         
	Dhoni and Co. reached Vadodara in the morning, on a delayed Jet Konnect flight from Mumbai, while Ricky Ponting and his men (barring three New South Welshmen) landed in the evening.         
	According to manager Steve Bernard, the trio  Brett Lee, Nathan Hauritz and Doug Bollinger  wouldnt be able to come before Saturday evening.         
	Hardly an ideal situation, but one forced on the team management when New South Wales Blues made (and, as it turned out, won) the Champions League final in Hyderabad.         
	Coach Tim Nielsen has gone public with his unhappiness, but he seems to have forgotten employer Cricket Australias stake in the T20 tournament.         
	Temperatures have been falling in most parts of the country, but its rather different here. Is it going to be high on the field, too?         
	We will soon know.

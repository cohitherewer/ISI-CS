The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hayden for scrapping Trophy
                                                   Hayden for scrapping Trophy
                      
	London: Former Australia opener Matthew Hayden wants the Champions Trophy to be scrapped as he feels it is meaningless to hold the eight-nation tournament along with a World Cup every four years.         
	Why have the Champions Trophy (a 50-over tournament) when youve already got a 50-over World Cup? Hayden wrote in his newspaper column. There are strong lessons to be learned from the success achieved in other sports, such as the quadrennial cycle of football World Cup and European Championships.         
	Cricket should follow this with a similar cycle of T20 World Cup and ODI World Cup. To maximise coverage, these should be played in odd-numbered years  footballs major competitions, and the Olympics, are in even-numbered years. The Champions Trophy should be scrapped, he added.         
	Hayden said even the Twenty20 World Cup should not be held every second year. Playing the World Twenty20 every other year is too much, he said. Theres too much cricket, too much of it is meaningless, and there are just too many different formats.         
	Hayden said Test cricket can be rejuvenated by a World Championship and by avoiding matches between heavyweights and minnows.         
	If Test cricket is to be the No.1 form of the game, the public, players and financial backers around the world must be engaged. I propose the establishment of a World Series, or a World Test Championship if you like, which would be on a rolling calendar with finals every two years, he said.

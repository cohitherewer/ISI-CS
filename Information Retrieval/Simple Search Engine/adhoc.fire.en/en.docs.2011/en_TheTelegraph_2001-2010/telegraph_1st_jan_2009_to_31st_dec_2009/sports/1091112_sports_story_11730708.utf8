The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Drama again, Yousuf to lead
                                                                                                                                     Drama again, Yousuf to lead
                  Mohammed Yousuf                       
	Karachi: Mohammed Yousuf will captain Pakistan in New Zealand after Younis Khan asked for a break from international cricket , the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said Wednesday.         
	That is why the Board has decided to appoint Yousuf as captain and wicket-keeper Kamran Akmal as vice-captain for the Test tour, a PCB spokesman said.         
	Pakistan play the first Test in New Zealand on Nov. 24.         
	The change in captaincy follows Pakistans one-day series loss to New Zealand, in Abu Dhabi this week, amid growing criticism of Youniss poor batting form and local media reports suggesting he had lost the confidence of his teammates.         
	He survived a revolt after the Champions Trophy in October when a group of senior players complained to PCB chairman Ijaz Butt about his attitude towards them.         
	But the Board rejected their demands and refused to accept Youniss resignation, asking him to continue as captain until the next World Cup in 2011.         
	However, on Wednesday Butt told a television channel: Younis has taken the correct decision at this time by opting out of the tour.         
	The decision to appoint Yousuf as captain for the New Zealand series has been taken in the best interests of Pakistan cricket.         
	Butt also said he had made it clear Younis would remain captain as long as he retained form and fitness. Younis has had a poor run of form since the Champions Trophy, with low scores in three ODIs to add to the pressure on his captaincy.         
	Yousuf, 35, is the senior-most player in the team with 82 Tests and 278 ODI appearances under his belt.         
	He rejoined the Pakistan team on the Test tour of Sri Lanka in July-August after having resigned from the rebel Indian Cricket League in which he played for one season.         
	Former Pakistan player and captain Inzamam-ul Haq, meanwhile, said the Board should appoint Yousuf as skipper on a long-term basis.         
	He is a very senior and respected player in the side and it is unfair to name him captain for one series only. I think it is best if Younis first regained his form Inzamam said.         
	Inzamam added he was not surprised by Youniss decision as he, too, had experienced the problem of disgruntled players.         
	It becomes difficult for a captain to infuse fighting spirit in the team whose confidence he has lost, said Inzamam who retired in 2007.           (REUTERS)

	Washington: Somdev Dev Varman advanced to the second round of the ATP Washington Classic, setting up a grudge match against Croatian Marin Cilic who had defeated the Indian in the Chennai Open final in January.      
	Somdev beat fellow qualifier Yuichi Sugita of Japan 6-0, 7-6 (8-6) on Monday and will get a chance to settle scores with the sixth-seed Croatian, who had beaten him 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) in the Chennai Open final.      
	Im looking forward to facing him again, said Somdev. That feels incredible. To see your family all around, to play on those courts at a tournament youve been watching since you were 10, that makes it special, he added.      
	Somdev walked off with the first set against Sugita in just 20 minutes and even pocketed the first nine games of the match before his Japanese counterpart rallied to win four games in a row.      
	In the second set, the tie-breaker turned out to be a roller-coaster ride as Somdev lost the first two points, won the next four, then conceded four points in a row to give Sugita two set points.      
	But the Indian raised his game and grabbed the last four points to seal the match in 85 minutes.       
	I should have done a better job finishing off the match, Dev Varman said. I definitely let my foot off the pedal. I let him into the match.      
	World No. 153 Somdev, who reached a career-high 127 two weeks ago, won the US national college crowns in 2007 and 2008 at the nearby University of Virginia.      
	Im a better player than last year, Dev Varman said. I was fresh from school last year. I have more experience playing under adversity. Thats what makes you a better player.      
	Its about going through the ups and downs and learning from that. It has been challenging, Dev Varman said. Im playing higher percentage tennis. That is helping me make gains, he added.       
	Former world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt, meanwhile, launched his American hardcourt season by defeating Donald Young 7-5, 6-2 in the first round.      
	Hewitt, playing for the first time since reaching the Wimbledon quarter finals, broke Youngs serve five times in a row and six times overall to overwhelm the 20-year-old American.      
	Despite the cozy straight-sets victory, Hewitt had trouble shaking off the rust. He landed just 39 percent of his first serves and was broken three times by the 20-year-old Young, formerly the worlds top-ranked junior.      
	I didnt serve my best tonight, said the 42nd ranked Hewitt. Its always hard playing your first match after a few weeks off. The ball was bouncing pretty high out there.      
	Its a lot different than playing on the grass over the last month in England.      
	Young, ranked 162nd, was successful on just 36 percent of his first serves.      
	Hes very talented and he just hasnt fulfilled his potential just yet, Hewitt said after his first meeting with the lefthander. The 28-year-old Hewitt, tournament champion in 2004 but unseeded this year, will play 15th seed Dudi Sela of Israel in the second round.      
	In other matches, Russian Mikhail Youzhny needed one hour and 40 minutes to oust American Robert Kendrick 7-5, 3-6, 6-1, while Philipp Petzschner of Germany beat Teimuraz Gabashvili of Russia 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.

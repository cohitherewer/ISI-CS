	Abu Dhabi: Lionel Messi scored an extra-time winner as Barcelona beat Estudiantes 2-1 Saturday to win the Club World Cup, the European champions sixth trophy of 2009. Messi chested Daniel Alves cross into the goal in the 110th minute to secure victory.         
	Estudiantes had gone ahead in the 37th minute through Mauro Bosellis header before the Spanish champions late pressure paid off as Pedro Rodriguez headed home an equaliser against the South American champions with a minute to play.         
	Barcelonas bench erupted in celebration after the come-from-behind victory, while Estudiantes players looked on in disbelief or slumped to the ground.         
	The Copa Libertadores champions, looking for their first global title since 1968 when they was known as the Intercontinental Cup, kept Messi subdued until extra time, when the speedy Argentine ran at the defence constantly before cutting across the area to meet Alves perfect pass. It was Messis 16th goal this season.         
	Barcelonas victory allowed them to add the one missing piece of silverware to their already full trophy cabinet following final defeats in 2006 and 1992. They had already won the Champions League, Spanish league, Copa del Rey, Spanish Supercup and European Supercup this year.         
	Barcelona scored a deserved equaliser after dominating the second half, led by Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Pedro, who seized on Gerard Piques flicked-on header in the area to lob the ball over goalkeeper Damian Albil.         
	The two sides traded early chances before Boselli slipped between Carles Puyol and Eric Abidal to steer Juan Manuel Diazs cross from the left into the net at the near post.

	London: Andrei Arshavin scored his first goals for Arsenal in a 4-0 victory over Blackburn on Saturday, putting the Gunners on course to regain a place in the Premier Leagues top four. Emmanuel Eboue also had two goals as the Gunners moved into fourth place, the final Champions League spot, ahead of Aston Villa on goal difference with 52 points.         
	Arshavin, who completed his move to Arsenal from Zenit St. Petersburg last month, was credited with his first goal after just 75 seconds by tapping in a low cross from Theo Walcott. However, television replays showed the ball may have come off Blackburn defender Andre Ooijer before going past goalkeeper Paul Robinson.         
	Arshavin added his second in the 65th, collecting a through ball from Denilson and bursting down the left into the area before turning Blackburn right back Danny Simpson along the byline. He dribbled a few more paces and faked a cross before lifting a shot over Robinson.         
	The Russian playmaker nearly completed a hat trick in the 88th after taking a cross from Carlos Vela, but his shot was blocked by Robinson and the rebound fell to Eboue, who tapped the ball into the net to make it 3-0. Eboue added his second with a penalty in injury time after Martin Olsson brought down Vela in the area.         
	 Everton is sixth with 48 from 29 after beating struggling Stoke 3-1.         
	The loss leaves Stoke in the relegation zone with two points more than next-to-last Middlesbrough, which needed a last-minute equaliser by Marlon King to salvage a point in a 1-1 draw at home to Portsmouth. Peter Crouch scored for the visitors in the 30th minute.         
	Michael Owen returned for Newcastle in a 1-1 draw at Hull after missing five games with an ankle injury. Wigan won 2-1 at Sunderland with goals by Ben Watson and Charles NZogbia and Fulham triumphed 3-1 at Bolton with strikes by Andy Johnson, Simon Davies and Diomansy Kamara.         
	In Sundays Premier League matches Chelsea host Manchester City, a team with one of the worst away records and with the distraction of a strong run in the Uefa Cup.         
	Striker Didier Drogbas form has improved since Hiddinks arrival and Chelseas midfield has been strengthened by Michael Essiens return from a six-month injury layoff. Aston Villa hold fourth place and host Tottenham.    (AGENCIES)

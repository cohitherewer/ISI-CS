            John MacLeary                      
	Barcelonas Thierry Henry will miss the second leg of his sides Champions League semi-final with Chelsea after picking up an injury at the weekend.         
	The France forward injured his knee in the second half of Barcelonas 6-2 rout of Real Madrid in the Spanish capital on Saturday.         
	The former Arsenal captain had hoped to make an impression on his first return to the capital, however, he is now unlikely to travel.         
	Henry will have further tests on his knee as he seeks to regain his fitness for Barcas league game with Villarreal next weekend where Pep Guardiolas side could steal La Liga title back from bitter rivals Real Madrid.         
	Henrys absence will come as a blow to Guardiola who will also be without Rafael Marquez  who was stretchered off in the first leg  and Carlos Puyol who is suspended.

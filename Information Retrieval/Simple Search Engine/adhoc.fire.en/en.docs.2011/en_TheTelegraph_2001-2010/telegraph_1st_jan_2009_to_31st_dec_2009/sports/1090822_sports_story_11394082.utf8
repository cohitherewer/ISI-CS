The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India tie to be played tomorrow
                                                   India tie to be played tomorrow
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Torrential rain in the capital forced the postponement of the ONGC-Nehru Cup match between Lebanon and Sri Lanka at the Ambedkar Stadium on Friday.         
	The match will now be played on Saturday, said a member of the organising committee. Subsequently, all the group league matches have been postponed by a day each. The final, however, will be held as scheduled on August 31, the official added.         
	The heavy rain that lashed the capital for couple of hours in the evening, made the ground conditions at the Ambedkar Stadium totally unplayable. While the goal area at the Delhi Gate side was submerged in a pool of water, the condition on the opposite side was no better.         
	Given the substandard drainage system of the Ambedkar Stadium, the organisers are praying for some bright sunshine on Saturday morning. It would be difficult to bring the ground back to shape if it rains again tomorrow morning, said an official.         
	The weathermen, however, have already predicted frequent rainfall in Delhi in the second half of the month.         
	Last year, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) faced a similar situation when heavy rain in Hyderabad forced them to hastily shift the final of the AFC Challenge Cup to Delhi.         
	The Ambedkar Stadium pitch is already under scanner after national coach Bob Houghton bitterly criticised the organisers for offering an ill-prepared playing surface for the meet.         
	This time we dont have any such option, said a federation official. If the rain continues to pour like this, the tournament could be in jeopardy, the official added. Its our sheer bad luck, said an executive member of the All India Football Federation (AIFF). In the committee meeting, we were informed that Delhi should be the venue for the Nehru Cup as the city doesnt get much rain in the month of August.         
	The Indian team, who were scheduled to play Kyrgyzstan in a crucial match on Saturday, went out for their evening training session but couldnt practise more than a few minutes because of the heavy rain.         
	Houghton later said the one extra day may help injured stopper back Anwar to get back to shape for the Kyrgyzstan match that would now be played on Sunday. The coach also hinted that Sunil Chetri is likely to figure in the starting eleven for that match.         
	India now face a must-win situation against in the five-nation tournament. In the opening match against Lebanon, the Indians played well but could never find the equaliser after conceding an early goal in the fourth minute of the match.         
	Houghton admitted Friday that it will be a daunting task for India to defend the Nehru Cup title.         
	Probably we have to win all our matches if we want to defend the title, Houghton said after the rain-affected practice session. He also rued the missed chances during the opener against Lebanon. We created more opportunities than Lebanon. But we were unlucky to lose, he said.         
	Saturdays match: Lebanon vs Sri Lanka.

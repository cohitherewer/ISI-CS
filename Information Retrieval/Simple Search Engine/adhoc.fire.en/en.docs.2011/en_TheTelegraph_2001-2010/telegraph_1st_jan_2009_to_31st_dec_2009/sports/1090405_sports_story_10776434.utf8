The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chelsea spoil Shearer debut
                                                   Chelsea spoil Shearer debut
                      
	London: Chelsea proved unpopular guests at the Alan Shearer homecoming party on Saturday as they won 2-0 at St James Park to stay in the Premier League title hunt and leave Newcastle United mired in relegation trouble.         
	Goals by Frank Lampard and Florent Malouda early in the second half ruined the comeback of former Newcastle striker Shearer, who has taken over as manager until the end of the season.         
	We contained them in the first half, it was very even, but a mistake in the second half cost us, Shearer said. We then tried to open it up and you are always liable to the counter-attack.         
	Effort-wise theres no problem, the response from the players and everyone over the last few days has been great. There is a lot of hard work to be done, we havent got a lot of time, but I think well get there.         
	Shearers side have slipped three points from safety following good results for most of the teams immediately above them.         
	Blackburn Rovers scored twice in the last eight minutes to beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 and Stoke City claimed their first away win of the season with a 2-0 triumph at West Bromwich Albion.         
	Bolton Wanderers, helped by a 40-metre effort by Matt Taylor, thrashed Middlesbrough 4-1 while Hull City and Portsmouth drew 0-0.         
	The foot of the table makes grim reading for the three north-east clubs. West Brom are bottom on 24 points while Middlesbrough (27), Newcastle (29) and Sunderland, on 32 after losing 2-0 at West Ham United, fill the next three places.         
	Arsenals long-term absentees Cesc Fabregas and Emmanuel Adebayor combined for their two goals at the Emirates Stadium. Fabregas supplied the free kick and Adebayor headed home after eight minutes.

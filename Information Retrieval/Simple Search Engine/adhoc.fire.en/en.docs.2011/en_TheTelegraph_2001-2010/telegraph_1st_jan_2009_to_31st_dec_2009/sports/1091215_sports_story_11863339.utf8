                                                                                                                       7                                        Kings XI crown passes to Kumar
    - The owners wanted a change... its fine with me: Yuvraj             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Yuvraj Singh and Kumar Sangakkara                                 
	Rajkot: Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara has replaced Yuvraj Singh as the Kings XI Punjab skipper and will be leading the franchise in the third edition of the IPL, in 2010.         
	Confirming the development, Yuvraj told The Telegraph on Monday: The (six) owners wanted a change and I got a call from the new chief executive (Arun Srivatsa)... Its fine with me...         
	Asked if he knew the reason why, Yuvraj said: Youll have to check with the owners on that... I dont know...         
	The Kings XI Punjab is co-owned, among others, by Preity Zinta, Karan Paul and Ness Wadia.         
	Sangakkara, meanwhile, declined a detailed comment. How do I feel? Well, youll have to ask me in March, when IPL III gets under way... Im not saying anything now.         
	Yuvraj has become the fourth captain  after Rahul Dravid (Royal Challengers Bangalore), V.V.S. Laxman (Deccan Chargers Hyderabad) and Sourav Ganguly (Kolkata Knight Riders)  to be removed by a franchise. Sourav has, of course, since been reinstated.         
	Dravid, Laxman and Sourav had been sacked after the inaugural year, 2008, while Yuvraj survived for two editions.

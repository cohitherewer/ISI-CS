 AFC Cup 
  -   Second-string Al-Wehdat rally to beat city club 2-1              A STAFF REPORTER            Hassan Abdel Fattah scores past Peter Odafe during their AFC Cup match at the Howrah Stadium on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagans decision to rest some of the key players proved costly as they lost 1-2 to Al-Wehdat of Jordan in a Group D match of the AFC Cup at the Howrah Stadium on Tuesday.         
	After Rakesh Masih put the home team ahead in the 13th minute, the Jordanian club equalised three minutes later through Mahmoud Shelbaieh.         
	Hassan Abdel Fattah made it 2-1 for the visitors three minutes before half time. After the change of ends, Bagan made some desperate forays into the rival territory but failed to convert the chances that came their way.         
	This was Bagans second loss on the trot in AFC Cup and fourth consecutive in all competitions  they lost to East Bengal and Churchill Brothers in their last two I-League matches.         
	Coach Karim Bencharifa may sell his idea of winning the I-League title was more important than an AFC Cup group match, but a win on Tuesday would have definitely given them the confidence for the battles that lie ahead.         
	And Bagan could have done just that, had they showed a bit of ambition and some application. Al-Wehdat, playing without five of their regulars, were vulnerable on Tuesday but Bagan, with their minds on the I-League, failed to realise it till the Malaysian referee Abdul Wahab blew the final whistle.         
	Bagan had their chances. Branco Cardozo headed it wide and Marcoss header hit the base of the near post among the most notable chances. But it was too little too late.         
	Bagans decision to go with a single striker in a home match defied logic. Its not that Bhaichung Bhutia did not try but at his age, playing as a lone striker was asking for too much. Each time he had the ball, Bhaichung was easily dispossessed by the defence, which was physically superior.         
	If Bhaichung had some support upfront, the Al-Wehdat defence would not have had an easy outing. Agreed they were physically superior  their skipper and central defender Haitham Semrin was almost six feet five inches tall  but tactically they did not look sound.         
	Bagan capitalised on that to take the lead. Lalkamal Bhowmick set up James Singh on the run, who played it to Bhaichung in the middle. The Bagan skipper, with all his expertise, held onto the ball for a moment and passed it to Rakesh Masih, who had all the time to hit a low right-footer that went past goalkeeper Amer Shafi. The Al-Wehdat defence did not have a clue about what hit them till there was a roar from the crowd.         
	If Al-Wehdat managed to garner full points, it was mainly due to the exploits of Hassan Abdel Fattah and Amer Deeb. Amer has been the vital cog in the Al-Wehdat attack, spraying passes to the front-liners and falling back whenever Bagan ventured into the rival half. Amer worked in tandem with Issa Alsapah who tormented Bagans weakest link N. Mohanraj throughout.         
	Mohanrajs failure to close down on Alsapah brought the equaliser. Alsapahs delivery from right was accurate and Shelbaieh obliged with a header as right-back Rahul Kumar was hopelessly out of position.         
	The match-winner came when Fattah latched on to Amer Deebs pass and his left-footer gave Sangram Mukherjee no chance to move.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Time to play catch-up
                                                                                                                   Time to play catch-up
      THE THIRD I-LEAGUE KICKS OFF TODAY. AS THE GOANS SET THE PACE, IT IS TIME FOR THE CALCUTTA GIANTS TO AWAKE FROM THEIR SLUMBER, RUB THEIR EYES AND MEASURE UP TO THE LIKES OF CHURCHILL BROTHERS AND DEMPO. THE TELEGRAPH TAKES A LOOK AT THE 14 TEAMS AND THEIR FIREPOWER -                   FREE KICK
     P.K. BANERJEE    
	The other day when Mohun Bagan were routed by Churchill Brothers in the Durand Cup final, some local football fans asked me whether the Calcutta teams would be able to make a comeback in the I-League. I bluntly told them it was not possible under the present circumstances.        
	I had a good look at both East Bengal and Bagan in the IFA Shield and also watched a few matches of the Durand Cup. If East Bengal were simply disappointing, Bagan were thoroughly exposed against Okolie Odafes Churchill Brothers in both the finals.         
	My forecast for the I-League is simple. If Odafe can maintain his current form then Churchill can no way be dislodged from their top position. No defender in the country has the ability to stop this Nigerian unless the opposite team decides to go for a highly efficient double covering. But then not many teams in India are capable of executing this plan to perfection.         
	Frankly, I was too overwhelmed by Odafes performance in the Durand final. It is evident that he mainly dribbles with the right foot but still gets the better of his opponents because of variations. The way he ran rings around Deepak Mondal and other three defenders was a treat to watch. And mind it, all the four Bagan defenders are India campers.         
	The I-League this time, I assume, will once again be a show of strength for foreigners. The national team players, who recently won the Nehru Cup, will continue playing second fiddle to foreign recruits like Odafe, Jose Ramirez Barreto, Ranty Martins and others. Even Dempo Sports Club, who have an array of India stars in their ranks, will have to get the services of another good foreign player to vie for the top spot.         
	Recently, East Bengal have managed to get Bhaichung Bhutia in their squad. Bhaichungs inclusion will certainly lift their morale but it may not be enough to take the red and gold brigade beyond a certain level. For that, East Bengal will have to hire some truly good foreign players equal to the class of Mike Okoro, Douglas or Cristiano Junior. It was these foreigners who were mainly responsible for East Bengal winning the league thrice.         
	Bagan, too, need a few changes if they are serious about rising above their runners-up tag. I thought they really missed Bhaichung in the Durand final as he could have played a major role where Barreto was completely blocked by the Churchill defenders.        
	Going by the current strength, I have a feeling that Churchill, Dempo and Bagan are once again the main contenders for the title. Mahindra United have an outside chance but to strengthen their claims they will have to get a couple of top class foreign players.         
	Although Mohammed Rafi is a promising striker, he needs another crack shooter by his side to get the better of a strong defence.         
	On the whole, I expect the league to be a better show this time because of the new teams and venues added to the list. Among the new teams, Pune FC and Lajong FC will be followed keenly. From whatever I have read in the newspapers, I have a feeling that both the teams are run by a dedicated group of people, who genuinely want to do something for the game.         
	More than 30 years ago, I once coached a school team from the northeast to the Subroto Cup title. During my short stay there, I was amazed by footballs popularity in that region. I hope Lajong FC would be able to exploit that enthusiasm to their advantage.         
	In the end, I must point out the lack of spectator support for the I-League in the past few seasons. The All India Football Federation (AIFF) projects I-League as the showcase domestic event but in many places it generates no more than a lukewarm interest. Even last year, the Calcutta league matches attracted greater crowds than the I-League.         
	The AIFF should immediately do something to arrest this downward trend.

                                                     Buchanan: We just werent able to seal it
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Ross Taylor in action against the Kolkata Knight Riders in Centurion on Tuesday. (AFP)                             
	Centurion: It was their ninth loss in 11 games and like some of the earlier matches, the Kolkata Knight Riders came close to a win, only to fritter away the opportunity with some very ordinary bowling at the death. Coach John Buchanan spoke very briefly to the media after the match.               
	The following are excerpts:               
	Q You went in with a different line-up today but still players like Charl Langeveldt and Mashrafe Mortaza are warming the bench         
	A I have heard this question before. Look, its still the same thing Today there was an opportunity to try some other players, which we did and we will continue to do that through the next three games or so. But its nice to be able to get the game to the death as we have done a number of times. We just havent been able to seal the games and theres no doubt about that. Certainly all the guys, who were required to bowl out there, are very disappointed with their performance because we did have a score which should have been defended, but we just werent able to do it.         
	Has the Kolkata Knight Riders turned into an experimental lab where players are given opportunities and winning the match is no more the objective?         
	No You can direct that question to the other teams as well. From our point of view, we have gone out there to win games with a team we have believed can win us games and thats exactly what we did again today. In a number of games we have been in situations which were good enough to win but we havent been able to do so. No, I dont really think its an experimental lab. Thats for sure.         
	Given the standing now, what is the team goal for the rest of the tournament?         
	Same same as we have said a number of times previously. Our job is to try and go out in the next game and do our best. Hopefully we will be able to cross the line thats what we are trying to do. Now we have got matches against three of the top sides vying for the semi-final position (Deccan Chargers, Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals). Our job is to hopefully turn the result around and make life difficult for them. Thats still the same aim, what we have had for a number of games.               
	Captain Brendon McCullum was also there at the press conference and answered the following question:         
	You finally got some runs in the tournament. It must have felt nice         
	Yes, it was nice to have made a contribution to the team for the first time in this tournament. But when you lose it still breaks your heart and today was no different. Probably, three-quarters into the game, we had it in the bag and it took a special innings from Ross Taylor to take it away from us. It put us under pressure and unfortunately we werent able to execute our plan as well as we would have liked. It was nice to get runs with the bat but I am disappointed.

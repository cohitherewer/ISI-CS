The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warner to replace Clarke
                                                   Warner to replace Clarke
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: David Warner will replace injured Michael Clarke in the Australia squad for Sundays match against South Africa in Hobart, according to information forwarded by Cricket Australia.         
	Clarke, who had injured his thumb, has been advised to rest for two weeks so that he can recover before the series against New Zealand.         
	Australian teams physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said: When Michael arrived in Melbourne on Wednesday, it was evident that after one weeks rest, the pain in his thumb had decreased enough for him to bat at training the following day.         
	However, during last nights match, he experienced pain while batting. It was the first time that he had batted without an injection since suffering the injury during the 3 Mobile Test match at the WACA.         
	While Michael could continue to play with pain-relieving injections, this will ultimately slow his recovery.         
	As a result, it was decided that he will now rest for two weeks, after which he will be reviewed by Cricket Australia medical staff with the plan for him to be available for the Commonwealth Bank Series against New Zealand, he added.

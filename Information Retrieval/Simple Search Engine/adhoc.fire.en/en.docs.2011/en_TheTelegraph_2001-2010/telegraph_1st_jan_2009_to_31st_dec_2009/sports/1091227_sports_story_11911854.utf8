The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Viru, best of the decade
                                                                                                                       7                                        Viru, best of the decade
  - Sehwags aggressive approach has revolutionised the openers role         Derek Pringle            Virender Sehwag                                 
	Depending on the parameters used, there are many candidates for cricketer of the Noughties. Statisticians and the Government policy-makers trust figures, wise men, facts, but Im going to apply another measure: that of redefining the role they play, something Virender Sehwag has done for opening the batting in Test matches.         
	To many, the choice will appear controversial. Shane Warne, Muttiah Muralidharan, Jacques Kallis, Sachin Tendulkar, have all excelled over the past 10 years. But they all announced their brilliance in the Nineties, so were discounted, while Ricky Ponting and Kevin Pietersen, the other candidates for best player of the decade, have not really changed perceptions as the Delhi-born Sehwag has.         
	 Dashing openers have always been with us, and Chris Gayle may yet take violence against the new ball a step further, but nobody yet has managed to do it with the audacity and frequency of Sehwag. As Graham Gooch, one of Englands greatest openers and a mean striker of a cricket ball himself said: Id pay to watch him bat, and Gooch has seen four decades of cricket for free.         
	Sehwags figures are impressive even before you consider the thrilling manner of their compilation. Two triple and four double hundreds in a 72-Test career is a weighty achievement for one who bats as if needing to catch the last plane out of Kabul. He almost completed a third triple hundred in a recent Test against Sri Lanka, but fell just seven runs short. No one, not even Bradman or Brian Lara, has three.         
	As most of his innings proceed at a run-a-ball, or better, there is a high-risk element to his shot-making. And yet there is also an appetite for runs at odds with the thrill-seeker in him that chases boundaries. When he first appeared, bowlers consoled themselves with the fact that while humiliation was always likely, it would probably be brief. They cannot bank on that now as age and experience have sharpened his judgement to the point that a hundred no longer sates him, or the crowd, as it once did.         
	It isnt always the big score that floors opponents. When England returned to India in the wake of the Mumbai massacre, they were nailed on favourites to win the first Test in Chennai after dominating the first 4 and half days. But they hadnt reckoned upon Sehwag.         
	India were set 386 in a day and a session by Pietersen; hefty scoring on a flat pitch let alone one close to collapse. They needed an electric start and Sehwag gave them one, cutting and carving Englands opening attack of Steve Harmison and James Anderson to the point of surrender as India notched their hundred in just under 20 overs.         
	His innings of 83 runs off 68 balls included four sixes and 11 fours and it gave India those crucial components of the tricky run chase, impetus and belief. It also heralded the beginning of the end for Harmison, whose lack of fibre and fitness saw him treated like a park bowler.         
	Tendulkar stole all the plaudits when he completed the task with an unbeaten century the following day, but those present at the ground had seen how Sehwag had crushed Englands belief beyond repair. The fallout and recriminations eventually cost both Pietersen and Peter Moores, Englands captain and head coach, their jobs, but then it was a most destructive innings.         
	Most bowlers know the dangers but what many find difficult to get their head around is the how the Errol Flynn of batting can look so unprepossessing in the flesh.         
	Not much taller than Tendulkars 5ft 5in, Sehwag, now 31, is nondescript, a short, balding, roly-poly man, who could be running a Delhi shoe shop (you have to be reasonably prosperous to be tubby in India). It is only when he swings his bat and the ball rockets past cover to the boundary that his aura is transformed into a Viv Richards-like menace and bowlers begin to tremble.         
	Like many of the great ball strikers, he scarcely moves his feet when he bats, relying on the kind of hand-eye co-ordination a raptor would be proud of. His best strokes favour the off-side and he needs only the merest sliver of room with which to send the ball hurtling to the fence. For bowlers brought up on the verities of bowling in the corridor of uncertainty just outside off stump, Sehwag is the bogeyman who brings nightmares.         
	His aggressive approach has revolutionised the openers role. Instead of caution and occupation of the crease as a means of removing the new balls shine, Sehwag hits it against abrasive objects beyond the boundary, as hard and as often as possible. He should be much better known than he is, even in India, and would be but for the monopoly of Tendulkar, his friend and rival.         
	He once said that the only difference between them was the bank balance. Yet, for those who like their heroes to tread the high wire and overreach themselves, Sehwag has been, by far, the more enriching.

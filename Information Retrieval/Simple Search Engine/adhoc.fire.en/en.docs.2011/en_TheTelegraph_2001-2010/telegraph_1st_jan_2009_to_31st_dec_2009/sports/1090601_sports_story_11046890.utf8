The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Azarenka knocks out Ivanovic in straight sets
                                                   Azarenka knocks out Ivanovic in straight sets
                      
	Paris: Defending champion Ana Ivanovic crashed out of the French Open on Sunday, losing in straight sets to Belarus Victoria Azarenka on Suzanne Lenglen Court.         
	Given that eighth seed Ivanovic had not lost a set in her run to the last 32, Azarenkas 6-2, 6-3 victory came as a surprise. The ninth seed will take on top seed favourite Dinara Safina next. Safina has dropped just five games in her march to the quarter finals.         
	The world No. 1 continued her imperious form on clay with a comprehensive 6-1, 6-0 win over French hope Aravane Rezai.         
	As Rafael Nadal also lost, this became the first time the two defending champions lost in the same round at a Grand Slam tournament after 2004, when Justine Henin and Juan Carlos Ferrero lost in the second round of the French Open.         
	Eighth seed Ivanovic did little right, converting only two of five break points and making 20 unforced errors. Before the final game of the first set, Ivanovic called for a trainer to look at her neck. Azarenka then held to take the lead, and broke Ivanovics serve in the first and third games of the second set to take a 4-0 lead.         
	I started really well, and I felt really good in the beginning. Then after the third game, actually after (the) first point in the fourth game, I just suddenly started feeling so dizzy, and I completely lost my balance, said Ivanovic, who won her only Grand Slam title at last years French Open. Ever since then, it was really hard. I struggled with looking up. I started feeling very dizzy, and I was struggling a little bit to find my balance.         
	The 19-year-old Azarenka lost in the fourth round at Roland Garros last year, and will be playing in the quarter finals of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time.         
	Safina had a much easier time on the centre court, advancing to the quarter finals with a 6-1, 6-0 win over Aravane Rezai of France. The top-seeded Russian won 11 straight games to close out the match. She has lost only five games through four rounds, and has won four of the eight sets she has played at love.         
	No. 20 Dominika Cibulkova advanced by beating No. 29 Agnes Szavay of Hungary 6-2, 6-4. (agencies)

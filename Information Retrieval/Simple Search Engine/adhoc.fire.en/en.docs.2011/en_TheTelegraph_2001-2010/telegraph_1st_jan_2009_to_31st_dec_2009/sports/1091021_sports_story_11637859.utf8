The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | NSW have the edge
                                                     NSW have the edge
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            David Warner in action against Trinidad amp; Tobago                           
	New Delhi: Two Australian teams will renew their rivalry at the Kotla on Wednesday, when New South Wales Blues clash with Victoria Bushrangers for a place in the final of the Champions League Twenty20.         
	With all the three Indian teams, including local favourites Delhi DareDevils, out of the competition, the otherwise vociferous crowd at the Kotla will have little or nothing to cheer about, and captains of both the teams are aware of this unusual situation.         
	Its an interesting concept. two Australian teams playing each other at a neutral venue, said NSW captain Simon Katich. We had lot of battles in the past, especially in the last two weeks, we had a good rivalry. Im sure it is going to be a great game tomorrow.         
	Like Katich, Bushrangers captain Cameron White is also not ready to attach much importance to non participation of the crowd in the key encounter. I know it wont be too much about the crowd tomorrow. We both know each other well, and it should be a well-fought encounter.         
	On paper, NSW hold the edge as they seem to be a better lot in both batting and bowling departments. If Simon Katich, Stuart Clark and David Warner are the backbones of the NSW batting, then they have a bowler in Brett Lee, who, on his day, is capable of producing a match-winning performance single-handedly.         
	It was clear from Katichs words that he considers Lee as his trump card in India. Hopefully, well get support from the home crowd because of Brett. He has a good following here, said Katich.         
	NSW won all their matches in the group stage before tasting their lone defeat against Trinidad amp; Tobago, who are in roaring form. However, there is no reason to believe that Bushrangers are not capable of upsetting their more fancied rivals. More than the batting, it is their bowling department, comprising Shane Harwood, Peter Siddle and Clint McKay, that threatens the rivals.         
	All said and done, the wicket at the Kotla is likely to worry both teams. The pitch has shown the tendency of being slow and low from the beginning, and has not seen a single high-scoring match so far.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mind your business, Gayle tells Strauss
                                                   Mind your business, Gayle tells Strauss
                      
	London: West Indies captain Chris Gayle has hit back at Andrew Strauss for criticising his late arrival from the Indian Premier League (IPL), saying the England captain should concentrate on his own team and he wouldnt be sad if Test cricket did not survive.         
	Gayle was criticised by Strauss after he reached England just two days prior to the first Test, which the West Indies lost by 10 wickets within three days.         
	Stay out of peoples business, Gayle warned ahead of the second and final Test starting Thursday.         
	Focus on his team, dont worry about West Indies, dont worry about me.         
	Tell him dont sleep with Chris on his mind, tell him get Chris off his mind, Gayle told a daily.         
	Gayle said Strauss should be worrying about his future in the event of Test crickets demise.         
	I wouldnt be so sad, said Gayle on Test crickets possible death.         
	Some other players would be. Maybe Andrew Strauss would be sad.         
	Maybe he will be sad if Test cricket dies and Twenty20 comes in. Because there is no way he can make the change. So tough luck.         
	I like Twenty20 since it come about now. I like it. Who doesnt? Maybe a couple of the Englishmen wouldnt like to play Twenty20.         
	The West Indian opener also said he is not willing to continue with his captaincy.         
	To be honest with you theres a possibility I might give it up  I will be giving it up shortly. Its definitely not something Im looking to hang on to.         
	I need some time for myself, to be honest with you, its a lot of travelling.         
	Theres always something you have to go and do, you know, extra. Lunch or dinner, some other thing, theres always something for the captain.         
	Im not that type of person. I cant take on too much things.         
	So soon I will be handing over this captaincy. I soon finish with it.           (PTI)

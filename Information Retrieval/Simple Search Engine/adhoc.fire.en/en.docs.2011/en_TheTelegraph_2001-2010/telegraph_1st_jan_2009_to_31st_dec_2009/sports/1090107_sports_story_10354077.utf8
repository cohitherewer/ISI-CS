	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) think-tank is quite impressed with the quality of talent on display in the selection trials at the Eden for the ensuing second season.         
	After the second day of the camp, where the 45 boys were divided into four teams that played two Twenty20 matches, captain Sourav Ganguly, assistant coach Brad Murphy and wicketkeeping coach Wade Seccombe appeared quite impressed.         
	Chandigarh batsman Sunny Singh, Bengal bowler Sourav Sarkar along with local boy Amit Das, Orissa opener Nataraj Behra, Sachin Rana of Arunachal Pradesh and Punjab pacer Anureet Singh and Shatrunjay Gaekwad have bright chances to make it to the final squad of the Kolkata Knight Riders for the upcoming season.         
	According to a Knight Riders official, boys were very much impressive and things were shaping up really well.         
	We are very happy with the proceedings today But I feel we will get a clearer idea tomorrow. Batting today in the morning was tough But these boys were keen and I feel everybody tried his best, a KKR official said.         
	Asked to name those who are frontrunners for final selection, he said: John (Buchanan) has left for Australia today So we will be having a teleconference with him this weekend. Sourav, Seccombe, Murphy all will be present at the meeting.         
	Today everybody played well. Sunny Singh, Amit, Behra and Sachin Rana have impressed us But nothing is confirmed yet We can select three players or the list can go up to 30, the official added.         
	Wicketkeeping coach Seccombe while addressing the media after the trials said: They are all good cricketers, there is not an iota of doubt about that. But we want to know how good they are in the Twenty20 format. We are looking for something special. We are looking at how they adapt to the Twenty20 game         
	There is speculation that Ricky Ponting might be unavailable for the second edition because of his wrist injury.         
	Meanwhile, the Eden witnessed Sourav Ganguly in two different roles on Tuesday. While the first Twenty20 match, between Ashok Dinda XI and Laxmi Ratan Shukla XI, saw the former Team India skipper stand in as umpire, the second match between Yashpal Singh XI and Shatrunjay Gaekwad XI saw him follow the proceedings closely as a selector.         
	Officiating in the match, Sourav gave Laxmi Ratan Shukla lbw and witnessed Mohammed Azharuddins son Mohammed Ashaduddin get run out on one.         
	Mumbai batsman Vinit Indulkar was hit above his left eye by an Anureet delivery. He however, was fine and joined the probables for the pep-talk after the match.

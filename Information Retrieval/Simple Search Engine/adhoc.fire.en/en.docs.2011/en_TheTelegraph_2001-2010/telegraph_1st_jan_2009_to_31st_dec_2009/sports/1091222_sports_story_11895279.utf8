	Cuttack: India captain Virender Sehwags assessment of the Barabati strip on the eve of third Karbonn Cup one-day International was spot on.         
	He had said it would be a slow batting wicket, where fielding first would be the best option, keeping the dew factor in mind.         
	Ravindra Jadeja proved his captain right with a disciplined bowling effort, which was complemented by Sachin Tendulkar (96 off 104 balls). The maestro brought all his experience into play to help India win the match by seven wickets in 42.4 overs here on Monday.         
	He missed his 46th ODI century but this half-century (his 93rd) may prove to be a significant one in the context of the series. Yuvraj Singhs grandpa showed what experience is worth in a tricky situation. On a pitch not conducive for stroke-play, Sachin played a gem of an innings.         
	Sehwag, Tillekaratne Dilshan, Mahendra Singh Dhoni  all have had their days in this series.         
	A champion like Sachin could not have waited longer to make his mark. Monday was the most difficult day for batting in this series so far, and the Little Master made the day his own. The manner in which he planned and paced the innings is a lesson for all.         
	At the start of Indias chase, Sehwag (44) was cautious. He gave a maiden to Chanaka Welegedara in the first over. Sachin, on the other hand, got off the blocks with a couple of boundaries off Welegedara and Nuwan Kulasekera.         
	But Sehwag suddenly changed gears and hit a number of boundaries as Sachin dropped anchor. Sehwag hit Lasith Malinga for three boundaries in the sixth over of the innings. Sixteen runs came off that over, and the floodgates suddenly seemed to have opened. Sehwags end, too, came suddenly as Dilshan held onto a hard slash at backward point.         
	Gautam Gambhir (32), Yuvraj Singh (23) and Dinesh Karthik (36 ..) played their parts well, but Sachin was the star. He wrote the script, directed the other characters and played the protagonists role with perfection.         
	Sri Lankan bowling lacked sting. Their spin department, in particular, looked toothless.         
	There was no mystery in Ajantha Mendis bowling; Suraj Randiv tried his best but his inexperience showed. He rarely gave the ball air, and was mostly busy trying to restrict the batsmen. With no Muttiah Muralidharan in the middle-overs, the Indian batsmen only needed to apply themselves properly.         
	Earlier, Dilshan started from where he had finished in Nagpur, hitting Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma all over the park. However, the whirlwind did not last long. From 165 for one in 22.2 overs, the visitors slumped to 239 all out in 44.2 overs. They lost nine wickets for only 74 runs.         
	Jadejas left-arm spin was superbly effective on the slow track. He returned career-best figures. Harbhajan Singh and Sehwag also bowled well in the middle-overs to bring the run-rate down. It had skyrocketed, thanks to Dilshans onslaught.         
	The opener slammed an 18-ball 41 (10x4), before Ashish Nehra banged one short, resulting in a simple catch for Karthik behind the stumps. Sangakkara and Upul Tharanga (73) added 100, but a moment of madness by the Lankan captain became the turning point of the match.         
	He stepped out to a flighted delivery from counterpart Sehwag. Sangakkara got beaten in the air, the ball kept low as Karthik failed to take off the bails on the first attempt but recovered in time to get rid of the graceful left-hander. Then Jadeja, Harbhajan, and Ishant, back for his second spell, triggered a collapse.         
	With India leading 2-1, Sehwag and his men will get a chance to wrap up the series in Calcutta. Over to Eden Gardens.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vettel pips Alonso to take pole position
                                                   Vettel pips Alonso to take pole position
                                      Vettel      
	Shanghai: Sebastian Vettel took a surprise pole position for Red Bull ahead of Renaults Fernando Alonso in qualifying for the Chinese Grand Prix on Saturday.         
	The 21-year-old German grabbed the second pole position of his career, and the first for his Renault-powered team, with a last-gasp lap of one minute 36.184 seconds.         
	With his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber third behind Alonso, the previously dominant Brawn GP cars of Rubens Barrichello and Jenson Button were pegged back in fourth and fifth.         
	The second qualifying jinx continues to plague Force India who will have Adrian Sutil 18th on the starting grid and Giancarlo Fisichella 20th for Sundays Chinese Grand Prix.         
	After finishing 19th in the qualifying session, Sutil would have joined Fisichella at the back but the German benefited after Timo Glock of Toyota dropped from 14th to 19th place after his gearbox change.         
	We knew it was going to be difficult here today (Saturday). We couldnt find a balance as we dont have enough downforce just yet, Sutil later said after he and Fisichella failed to make the cut for the second qualifying session.         
	Our goal now is to finish without any incidents. We know our car is reliable so maybe we can pick up some places like this, Sutil said.           
	Fisichella too said he would be happy just bringing his car home.  
	We are lacking grip aerodynamically, particularly in the slow speed corners. This race might be tough but we know there is another step to come in Bahrain so the aim here is to get to the finish. We need to have a good strategy and try to do what we can, said the veteran Italian.         
	Unbelievable that we made it to pole, said Vettel, who became Formula Ones youngest race winner in Italy last year with Toro Rosso. It was not easy. We had some problems with the car and we tried to run as little laps as possible.         
	Spaniard Alonso, who clocked 1.36.381, was an equally surprising presence in second for Renault, who made some radical changes to their car as they scrambled to catch up with the teams using the controversial rear diffusers.         
	It has been strange for us with a completely new car, we went in to qualifying with some doubts and we are very happy with the result for sure, said the two-time former world champion.         
	We only had three laps to test the new equipment on the car, said the Spaniard. While post-qualifying weights published by the governing body showed that Alonso would have the lightest car on the grid, with 637kg compared to Vettels 644kg and 661kg for Brawn GPs fourth-placed Rubens Barrichello, the Renault driver was still elated.         
	Australian Webbers time of 1.36.466 was enough to beat the Brawn of Barrichello in fourth with the Brazilians British teammate Button, who won the first two races of the season from pole, in fifth.         
	We knew they were competitive but we didnt think they were quite that competitive, championship leader Button said of the Red Bull duo. Its a pity that we are starting behind them because its very tough here to overtake. So well see what happens.         
	Toyotas Jarno Trulli and Nico Rosberg of Williams, both using the diffuser that was declared legal at an appeal hearing earlier in the week, were sixth and seventh ahead of the last two world champions, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari and Lewis Hamilton in the McLaren.         
	Although Ferrari continue to struggle with Felipe Massa missing out on the last round of qualifying and languishing in 13th place, defending champion Hamilton saw promise in his ninth place.

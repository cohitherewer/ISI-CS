                                                     Ricky pledges to make every run count for cancer cause
            A STAFF REPORTER            Ricky Ponting                           
	Calcutta: Ricky Ponting has more reasons to score runs during the upcoming Ashes. Every run the Australian captain scores in England will be worth money to childrens cancer charity.         
	Ponting Tuesday announced a major fund-raising initiative, on behalf of the Ponting Foundation, that will support children affected by cancer  but it all depends on how many runs he scores at this years Ashes.         
	Joined by wife Rianna and nine month-old daughter Emmy, Ponting launched Run Ricky Run to 400 primary school children at Sacred Heart Mosman in Sydney and called on all Australians to consider sponsoring him for the number of runs he will score during the Ashes.         
	As the senior batsman hes intent on playing a leading role in retaining the Ashes for Australia. As a fundraiser, he wants every run to count for a cause.         
	He gave the example of how a person contributing 25 cents for every run he scored would end up donating Australian $125 to the Ponting Foundation if he scored 500 runs in the series.         
	Run Ricky Run provides a direct link between the willingness of the Australian public to donate money to a fantastic cause and my ability to make runs for Australia, Ponting said.         
	Every run I score in the Ashes Tests will trigger a donation to one of the Foundations beneficiaries and 100 per cent of the proceeds raised will be distributed.         
	The Pontings have long been supporters of the Childrens Cancer Institute of Australia and they launched the Ponting Foundation in 2008 to expand their work across the childhood cancer issue.         
	Children are our future and we have to do everything we can to win the battle against childhood cancer, Ponting said.         
	The work of the Foundation has become more significant for Rianna and I since Emmy was born last year. Having a beautiful healthy child of our own has given us an even greater sense of determination and resolve to support the children and families that arent as fortunate as us.         
	Theres a fair bit riding on me getting runs in England but I wouldnt have it any other way, Ponting added.         
	Run Ricky Run will be rolled out over the next six weeks as part of the lead up to the first Test that starts in Cardiff on July 8. It will be promoted by Cricket Australia as part of its Cricket Cares programme. Australia lost the Ashes on their last tour of England in 2005 but won back the urn in 2006-07.         
	Ponting listed his previous Ashes series tallies on the campaign website for those interested in donating: he scored 576 in the last series when Australia won back the Ashes and 359 in England in 2005.         
	The 34-year-old Ponting averages 48.24, including seven centuries, in 26 previous Ashes Test matches. That is lower than his career average of 56.2. Overall, he has 37 centuries in 131 Test matches.

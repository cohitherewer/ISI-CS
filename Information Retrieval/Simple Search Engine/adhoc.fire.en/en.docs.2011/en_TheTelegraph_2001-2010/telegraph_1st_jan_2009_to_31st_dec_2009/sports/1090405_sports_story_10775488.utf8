The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Button clinches pole again
                                                     Button clinches pole again
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                                
	Jenson Button set a searing pace once again for Brawn GP as he secured pole position for the Formula One newcomers in Sundays Malaysian Grand Prix.         
	The British driver clocked a time of one minute 35.181 seconds to secure the fifth pole position of his career and his second in as many weeks.         
	Lewis Hamiltons miserable week continued with the world champion due to start 12th, after failing to negotiate the second stint of qualifying.         
	The second qualifying session (Q2) continues to elude Force India who will have Giancarlo Fisichella 18th on the starting grid followed by Adrian Sutil at 19th.         
	The qualifying session of the second race of the 2009 F1 season saw the Force India drivers just tenths from making the cut into Q2 with a throttle pedal problem plaguing Fisichella.         
	I had a problem with the throttle pedal on the first run, so we changed it and I lost the chance to do three runs, which was very important, a dejected Fisichella later said.         
	Jarno Trulli will line up alongside Button on the front row of the grid after finishing second with a lap of 1: 35.273 in the closing seconds.         
	Timo Glock recorded only the fifth best time in final qualifying but will be third on the grid in his Toyota as a result of penalties handed out to Sebastian Vettel and Rubens Barrichello. However, perhaps the biggest surprise was Felipe Massa, who will start near the rear of the field in 16th after failing to get his Ferrari through the first qualifying period.         
	Button trailed behind teammate Barrichello in the closing stages of Q3 but turned in another hot lap as the chequered flag came down to grab pole position once again.         
	Trulli had a chance to overhaul Button but his closing lap was 0.092 seconds adrift of the Brawn driver.         
	Vettel turned in an excellent final lap of 1:35.518 for the third best time, but the Red Bull driver will start 13th on the grid due to a penalty handed to the German for causing an accident involving Robert Kubicas BMW Sauber in Australia last weekend.         
	Barrichello posted the fourth best time but will start ninth after changing his gear box Friday. It meant Glock was promoted to third on the grid followed by the Williams of Nico Rosberg and Mark Webbers Red Bull.         
	Kubica will start sixth with Kimi Raikkonens Ferrari in seventh and the Renault of Fernando Alonso in eighth. Nick Heidfeld will line up alongside Barrichello on the fifth row in the second BMW Sauber after just missing out on the final qualifying stint.         
	Meanwhile, BMW Sauber lodged a protest against the rear diffusers being used by the Williams, Toyota and Brawn teams at the Malaysian Grand Prix.

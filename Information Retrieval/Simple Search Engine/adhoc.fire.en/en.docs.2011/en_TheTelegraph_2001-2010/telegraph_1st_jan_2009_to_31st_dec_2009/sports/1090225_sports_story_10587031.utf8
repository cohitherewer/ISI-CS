The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Terry and Co. meet their maker
                                                   Terry and Co. meet their maker
          
	London: Guus Hiddink gets the chance to measure himself against one of his most popular predecessors as Chelsea coach in Claudio Ranieri, when his new team takes on Juventus in the Champions League on Wednesday.         
	It could be a strange evening for Hiddink, who has benefited from a comparison with the ultimately unloved Luiz Felipe Scolari, as some of his longer-serving players look forward to seeing Ranieri on his first return to Stamford Bridge.         
	I love the man, Frank Lampard said. If it wasnt for Claudio, I might not be where I am now.         
	Ranieri signed Lampard in 2001 for what was widely seen as an exorbitant 11 million, but the England midfielder has gone on to become one of the clubs all-time greats. It is that kind of judgement, which included making John Terry captain, that will guarantee the Italian coach a warm welcome.         
	Lampard and Terry are likely to start against Ranieris Juventus side as Hiddink returns to the Champions League for the first time since replacing Scolari two weeks ago.         
	Ranieri could have France striker David Trezeguet back in the team while Alessandro del Piero may be able to take advantage of Chelseas recent fragility at free kicks and corners.         
	Bayern Munich coach Juergen Klinsmann is hoping Luca Toni will recover from injury in time to give his side an edge over Sporting Lisbon.         
	Toni was unable to train Monday but hopes to play at the Jose Alvalade stadium in the Portuguese capital where he reckons the 2001 European champions can get back on track.         
	Sporting have never advanced this deep into the competition and have never beaten a German opponent.         
	The Lions top scorer with eight league goals, Liedson missed the early part of Sportings campaign due to a knee injury that required surgery but he has recently produced a string of standout performances.         
	In Spain, Villarreals near-perfect Champions League home record will come up against a Panathinaikos side that have played well on the road.         
	Villarreal, who reached the competitions semi-finals in 2006, have never lost a Champions League match at El Madrigal stadium.           (AP)

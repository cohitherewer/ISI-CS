                                                   Personal feat not on Jhulans mind
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India captain Jhulan Goswami believes India are better prepared for the ICC Womens World Cup this time and the weak links have been sorted out.         
	We had a strenuous training camp in Bangalore in January Our final training camp begins in Mumbai from Friday, Goswami, ICC Womens Cricketer of the Year in 2007, said.         
	Prior to our preparations at home, we had tough tours to England and Australia last year and though both the tours ended in disappointment, they gave us an excellent opportunity to strengthen our strong areas and fix our weak links.         
	In terms of World Cup preparations, both series provided us with the chance to evaluate where we stood with ample time to find a way to lift our standards.         
	By playing three months prior to the main event, we have given ourselves a very good chance to put ourselves back on track. Needless to say it was also a good wake-up call for us, she said.         
	India were runners-up to Australia in the previous edition in South Africa in 2005 and are placed in Group A along with Sri Lanka, Pakistan and England this time.         
	Jhulan refused to take Sri Lanka and Pakistan lightly though India have an unbeaten record against the two countries.         
	Jhulan has so far played 93 ODIs and if India qualify for the final to be played on March 22 at the North Sydney Oval, that match will be her 100th ODI.         
	Playing 100 ODIs will be a perfect icing on the cake But I would like to focus on the tournament as winning the World Cup will bring huge honour to the country while completing century of ODIs will only be a personal landmark.         
	Jhulan said she would not hesitate to take advice from Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who will be in New Zealand during the tournament. If I need any guidance and advice, I will not hesitate to call Dhoni and I am sure he would reciprocate.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB clears air on selection
                                                   CAB clears air on selection
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) cleared the air on the dubious selection of Debayan Sarkar in place of Pankaj Shaw in the CAB Presidents XI squad for the upcoming P. Sen Invitational meet.         
	We wanted to promote some youngsters in our team and the decision to include Debayan was taken unanimously by the selectors, said a senior CAB official on Thursday.         
	However, the inclusion of Debayan, a left-arm spinner,in place of the in-form batsman Pankaj defies logic. Meanwhile, Town Club have roped in Saurabh Tiwari, Ishank Jaggi, Ravikant Shukla and Subhojit Paul.

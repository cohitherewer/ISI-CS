The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India colts take lead
                                                   India colts take lead
                      
	Hobart: Harpreet Singh and Mandeep Singh shared a 242-run partnership for the fifth-wicket to put the India colts in front against Australia under-19 on the second day at the Bellerive Oval on Sunday. India declared at 417 for 7, which put them 111 runs ahead of the hosts. The Aussies were 1 for no loss at the close of play.         
	The opening duo of Mayank Agarwal and Manan Sharma provided the visitors with a solid start putting on a 85-run stand. Manan was the first to depart, dismissed by Mitchell Marsh, five short of his fifty. Avi Barot didnt stay long being dismissed for a duck, caught by James Garrett off Jackson Coleman.         
	Agarwal was caught behind by Tom Triffitt off Marsh for 68. His 72-ball innings consisted of 11 boundaries. India U-19 were precariously placed at 148 for 3 going into lunch.         
	But Harpreet and Mandeep played excellently to lift India into a potentially match-winning position bringing up their individual centuries in the process.         
	Harpreets 125 came from 184 deliveries, including 14 fours and two sixes, while Mandeep scored a 155-ball 126, comprising 17 boundaries, as the pair took the Australian attack apart. Harpreet became Colemans second victim while Mandeep was bowled by Sean Abbott. Both fell in successive overs, with the score on 398 for 5. Marsh and Coleman were Australia U-19s most successful bowlers, picking up three wickets each.         
	Australia under-19 coach Brian McFadyen admitted that Harpreet and Mandeep had got the tourists into a strong position.         
	They are very good players. They really back themselves and play so confidently and fluently that its very difficult to apply pressure for any length of time. At times we did bowl extremely well but just werent able to apply purely through that offensive batting, McFadyen said.         
	McFadyen added that although it was a tricky day for his side, they would have taken a lot out of the experience.         
	It certainly was a tough day, particularly for the spinners. Theyve had an experience that is probably quite similar to a tough day in first-class cricket against a good opposition, who are good players of spin bowling, on a very flat wicket, he was quoted as saying on a cricket website.

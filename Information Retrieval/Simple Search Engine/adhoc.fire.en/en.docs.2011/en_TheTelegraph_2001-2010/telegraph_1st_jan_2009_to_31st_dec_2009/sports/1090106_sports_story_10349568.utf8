The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Terror cant deter Nikolay
                                                   Terror cant deter Nikolay
                      
	Chennai: The recent Mumbai carnage did not act as a deterrent for Russian tennis star Nikolay Davydenkos visit to India and the world No.5 is now determined to win the Chennai Open in the absence of compatriot Mikhail Youzhny.         
	I never had any second thoughts about coming to India because of the Mumbai terror attacks. If you remember Bangkok airport was closed for two weeks and reopened only on December 5 last. Such things happen.         
	It is not happening in Chennai, which is a different city. From 2002 I played in Doha for six years in a row. Now I tried to change something, Davydenko, tournament favourite and top seed, said at a media interaction.         
	With Youzhny preferring to play in Doha rather than playing here as defending champion, Davydenko said he would defend the title for his compatriot. I am very excited to play at the Chennai Open. The tournament has become very popular on the circuit. This is also my first visit to India so I am looking forward to playing here.         
	Last year Youzhny beat (Rafael) Nadal to win the tournament. I do not know why he has not come here being the defending champion. May be I need to defend him here now. (PTI)

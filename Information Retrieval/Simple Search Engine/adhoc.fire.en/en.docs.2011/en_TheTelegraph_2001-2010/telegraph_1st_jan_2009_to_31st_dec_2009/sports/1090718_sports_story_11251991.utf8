The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Haussler   takes stage 13
                                                   Haussler   takes stage 13
                            
	Colmar (France): German rider Heinrich Haussler outclassed the pack with a solo breakaway Friday to win a rainy 13th stage of the Tour de France, and Lance Armstrong remained third overall after losing a crucial ally to injury before the ride began.         
	Rinaldo Nocentini of Italy retained the yellow jersey for a seventh straight day after the chilly and wet ride from Vittel to Colmar, crossing the line with seven-time champion Armstrong, second-place Alberto Contador and the pre-race favourites 6 minutes, 43 seconds back.         
	Haussler, a 25-year-old Cervelo rider who won a stage at Paris-Nice in March, raced ahead of the second of two fellow breakaway riders in the last 50 kilometres (31 miles) and continued to build a gap on the peloton as the finish neared.         
	Haussler cupped his face in his hands and choked up with emotion as he crossed the line in 4:56:26  4:11 ahead of second-place Amets Txurruka of Spain. Brice Feillu of France was third, 6:13 back.         
	I was really happy. I just got teary, said Haussler, who was born in Australia to a German father.         
	Haussler, who collected his first Tour stage victory, had come into the stage in 105th place overall  55:24 behind Nocentini. He rose to 83rd overall with his win, 48:41 off the leaders pace.

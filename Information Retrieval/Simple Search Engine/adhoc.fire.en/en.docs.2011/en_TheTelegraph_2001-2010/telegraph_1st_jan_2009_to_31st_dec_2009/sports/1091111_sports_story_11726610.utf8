The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Safin has   solution   for Agassi
                                                                                                                                   Safin has   solution   for Agassi
            Eighth Column                            
	Paris: Marat Safin has come up with an instant remedy to help Andre Agassi clear his conscience after his admission that he lied about using drugs  hand back the millions of dollars he made in prize money.         
	Safin also suggested Agassi might also want to consider forfeiting all the titles he won during his long and celebrated career if he was serious about coming clean.         
	He feels guilty? So let him just give back his titles, money, his Grand Slams! Safin told a French sports daily.         
	If he is so fair play, he should go all the way. You know, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) does have a bank account, he can refund if he wants to.         
	Agassi, who retired in 2006, won 60 titles, including eight Grand Slams, in his career.         
	Safin, currently playing his last tournament in Paris this week, also questioned Agassis motives for revealing his past drug use in his autobiography Open.         
	In his book, Agassi revealed he had used and tested positive for crystal meth in 1997 but escaped punishment by lying to the investigators.         
	The American has since spoken about his remorse over his actions but Safin said was concerned about the way in which he confessed.         
	I wont write my biography. I do not need any money. The question is, why did he do it? the two-time Slam winner said. Whats done is done. He hopes to sell more books. But he is completely stupid!         
	I do not defend the ATP but what he said put them in a bad position. The ATP allowed him to win a lot of tournaments, to make a lot of money. They kept his secret so why be so cruel with them? There are times you need to be able to shut up.         
	Earlier this month, the World Anti-Doping Agency said they were investigating whether to lay fresh charges against Agassi.         
	But Agassi has insisted that Open was written to be cathartic  a part of his atonement for saying and doing things he now wishes he hadnt  and not to be a money-spinner for its author.         
	I cant live with that anymore, Agassi recently said in an interview with a news agency. These lies  some of them came, certainly, out of fear. A lot of them came out of real confusion. A lot of it was thinking out loud. A lot of it was just getting stuff wrong. And a lot of it started with lies to myself. When I retired from tennis, I had the opportunity, the time, the energy, to turn a real hard lens on myself.         
	Agassi called crystal meth a performance inhibitor and said: Everything I earned on the tennis court, I actually had to probably earn more than I needed to, because of many of the things I did to myself.         
	As to whether he ever took performance-enhancing substances as a professional, Agassi  who retired in 2006 , quot;No. No. The answer is No. quot;         
	In the book, Agassi recounts how, when he was a kid, his father would give him Excedrin before matches because it contained caffeine. Once, Agassi writes, his father gave him what Agassi believes to be speed. He also writes at various points about using marijuana and alcohol.         
	The candid confessions have also triggered off a backlash, from peers and fans alike. But Agassi is not surprised by the negative reactions           (AGENCIES)

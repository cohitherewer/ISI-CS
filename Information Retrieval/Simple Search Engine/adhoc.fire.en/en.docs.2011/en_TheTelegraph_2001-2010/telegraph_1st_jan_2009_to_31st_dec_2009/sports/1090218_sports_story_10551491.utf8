	Calcutta: Bengal rode the brilliance of their batsmen to outclass Assam by eight wickets in their second match of the East Zone National One-dayers for the Vijay Hazare Trophy at the Eden on Tuesday.         
	The combined effort of Wriddhiman Saha, Abhishek Banerjee and Sourav Ganguly enabled Bengal to overcome the target of 270 in just 45.3 overs. Bengal, having defeated Jharkhand in the first match by 90 runs, thus top the group at this stage.         
	Chasing a target of 270, Abhishek, who opened the innings with Wriddhiman, took the initiative to ease the pressure with his aggressive strokeplay.         
	Abhishek, who managed a meagre 13 in the earlier match, was under a bit of pressure to perform. But the youngster took up the challenge as he unleashed a flurry of shots square of the wicket to unnerve the Assam bowlers, and, in the process, brought down the required run rate. He notched up his 50 in just 39 balls.         
	Wriddhiman, at the other end, was complementing his partner effectively with his cautious approach. The chase began to look quite easy as Bengal raced to 88 runs in the first 15 overs.         
	Abhishek was the first to fall when he was trapped in front by spinner Arlen Konwar. His breezy knock of 68, comprising 11 hits to the fence, came off just 71 deliveries.         
	Wriddhiman took up the baton from thereon as he began milking the Assam bowling with shots all round the ground.         
	His ability to rotate the strike with regularity drew praise from Sourav Ganguly at the other end. His excellent innings of 102 runs formed the backbone of Bengals victory.         
	Also notable was the fact that he confronted the pain from a deep cut  the result of the ball rebounding off his gloves to hit his chin  to see Bengal through.         
	Sourav, who came in at the fall of the first wicket, was in his elements today, hitting 64 off 62 balls. He was in a destructive mood, stepping out and swinging his bat in his typical style.         
	The Bengal southpaw brought up his fifty with a massive six down the ground off Arlen Konwar. His innings seemed a prelude to the upcoming Indian Premier League and was adorned with six fours and two huge sixes.         
	He was castled by Konwar while attempting a big hit. Manoj Tiwary (26) then successfully partnered Wriddhiman to steer Bengal to victory.         
	Earlier in the day, Shib Sankar Roy (111) and Deepak Sharma (79) helped Assam put up a score of 269 for eight.         
	Roy, dropped on an individual score of 23 by Abhishek Banerjee off Avik Chowdhury, went on to score an excellently planned century.         
	His innings came off 120 balls and included 12 fours and a six. He shared a 146-run partnership with Sharma to help Assam put up a healthy total. Sharmas 79 came off only 74 balls.         
	Bengals bowling was dismal today as none of the bowlers managed to get anything out of the wicket. Ashok Dinda, who picked up a wicket with his first ball of the day, took three wickets, though his wayward bowling saw him concede 84 runs off 10 overs. Avik Chowdhury claimed 2 wickets for 37.         
	Bengal play their next match against Tripura on Thursday.

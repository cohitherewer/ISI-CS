The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kumar takes cautious approach
                                                     Kumar takes cautious approach
            A CORRESPONDENT            Kumar Sangakkara                           
	Nottingham: Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara on Sunday spoke to the media, a day before their opening match against Australia.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Are you surprised with Australias loss to the West Indies?         
	Not really, I saw how the match went. The West Indies batted really well. They didnt have a good start while fielding but the way Chris Gayle and the other opener batted, they were fantastic. If a team gets off to such a start, theres very little that the opposition can do.         
	Do you think Australia will be low on confidence?         
	I hope so, but knowing the Aussies, theyre going to come back even harder. Weve just got to be prepared mentally Need to believe we can beat them.         
	Must-win match for Australia changes things?         
	I think any team in a corner is going to come out fighting. The way weve seen this tournament go, its the side that performs best on the day that wins. Things can change very quickly in a little period of the game. A few mistakes here and there Even by a top side If they let it go a bit, they will pay. We saw that in a couple of games in the tournament and we might see it later on as well.         
	Opportunity to knock out the Aussies, is it spurring Lanka on?         
	Its just about winning every game. Its not just about knocking the Australians out, its about qualifying for the next round. Every game we play is a must-win game. Were just making sure that we are driven enough and prepared enough to win.         
	Are there no favourites?         
	Well, you can have favourites going into a tournament but sometimes during a tournament it changes. Weve seen that happen here in a couple of games. It doesnt matter if a team has the top players in the world On that day you have to be the best side.         
	The weather factor         
	The rain has played a big part. We can worry about the rain and this and that but any team walking out has to be prepared to play and look forward to playing. The grounds here are very good, as soon as the rain stops, the conditions in England enable the grounds to get up and running very quickly after the rain. Its going to be the mental factor, coming to terms with just waiting and being ready to play at anytime.         
	On the English conditions and spinners doing well         
	I think if you take Twenty20 cricket in England the successful bowlers have always been the spin bowlers. In the IPL, the most successful bowlers were spin bowlers. I think theres a new age of cricket now in every country where the slower bowlers have an impact on the game.         
	Batsmen are reading Mendis better. What does he need to do now?         
	The novelty is always going to fade the longer you play cricket. The batsmen are no fools, they are going to come up with plans and strategies to counter any bowler and Ajantha has just got to be a bit more creative in his thinking More creative in his field placings And just change the ways and angles of the deliveries he bowls. So hes got a lot of options left open and theres a lot that he can work with. Im sure hes going to become a stronger and better bowler. Hes going to have to change and change very quickly Its going to be an exciting time for him and the side. Hes one half of the best spin bowling combination in the world, hes got my support, the support of the coach and the entire team.

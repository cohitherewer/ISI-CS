                             No excuses... these are testing times: Dhoni 
    - If you think too much about the short-pitched balls, then your game changes           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  
	Nottingham: On the eve of the World T20 Super Eights getting under way, Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni told The Telegraph that hed take one match at a time (pehle ek-ek jeetna hai...).         
	Hed been responding to Pakistani counterpart Younis Khans wish for an Indo-Pak final.         
	After Sunday, though, Dhoni doesnt have to bother about the last Super Eight fixture  against South Africa, at Trent Bridge, on Tuesday.         
	Its all over for India, champions in the last edition.         
	Dhoni, of course, didnt offer excuses for Indias express departure from the tournament, but couldnt justify sending the in-form Yuvraj Singh at No. 5.               
	The following are excerpts from what he said at Lords               
	First reaction to ouster         
	Very disappointed... Wed stopped England at a decent total (153 for seven), but we were not up to the mark... Youre supposed to score that many on such a wicket, especially when the batting has been strengthened... When it comes to cricket, youve got to be there from the very start till the end... We lost wickets and too much was left at the end, when the ball was reversing... It wasnt our day and, now, nothing can be done about this World T20... Theres no real excuse... If youre bogged down or are really desperate to win, then youre not at your best... This defeat is a good lesson and if we dont repeat mistakes, then we will be a good side.         
	The strategy while chasing         
	Not to allow the asking-rate to go over nine or nine-and-a-half... However, it climbed on us and the momentum moved away.         
	Being done in by the balls pitched short         
	Not the first time it happened to us... Its about adaptability... The wickets had been lively and had bounce in South Africa (during the inaugural meet, in 2007)... But if you think too much about the short-pitched balls, then your game changes and you dont think about the deliveries you can score of... We need to work on areas (where the team failed)... Were going to the West Indies next and can expect the same (type of deliveries).         
	Sending Ravindra Jadeja at No. 4 and Yuvraj at No. 5         
	Jadeja plays the balls pitched short well... Sending Yuvraj up was an option, but I thought of holding him back for the later overs... Yes, the batting order couldve been different. Next time, maybe, we will send Yuvraj.         
	Big hits not coming from his bat         
	My game has changed over the last couple of years... Even in the ODIs, Ive taken some deliveries to settle down... Ive largely been batting from No. 5-7... Id like to get back to hitting sixes, but my cricket doesnt stop with them.         
	Dropping the in-form Pragyan Ojha         
	We wanted an extra seamer (Rudra Pratap Singh) and an all-rounder to replace Irfan Pathan... Jadeja did the work with the ball and RP delivered... Wed planned to chase, as the Lords wicket gets better, which is why I put England in.         
	Virender Sehwags absence         
	Hes a great player and was missed... He goes after the bowling... Cuts, flicks... He pulls the short ones...         
	The Sehwag-related controversy in a section of the media         
	It was upsetting, coming on the eve of the World T20... If there was anything, it was between him and me... We knew the truth... Were in the best position to know what happened... The dressing room atmosphere has always been great... The good thing about having seniors like Rahul Dravid and Sehwag is that you can straightaway walk up to them and say this is what happened... Theyre clever enough to understand.         
	His state of mind         
	If you take them (controversies) too seriously, then more often than not, you will not play well... Teammates help in that regard and we joke (about the controversies), allowing pressure to be released...         
	From the highs to this low, life coming a full circle         
	Cricket tests your character, not when youre doing well, but when youre not doing well as an individual and as a team... These are testing times, but not the end of the road... We will soon be in the West Indies (for four ODIs) and can prove a point there... The one good thing is that the next World T20 is just 10 months away (in the West Indies).         
	Whether this has been the worst moment in his career         
	Going out in the first round of the 2007 (50-over) World Cup was more disappointing... This one doesnt come anywhere near that... Youre disappointed whenever you lose, the only time you dont feel that disappointed is when a series is in your pocket and you lose the last match.         
	Non-stop cricket, including the IPL, leaving players tired         
	No... We should stand up and admit we didnt play well, no player should make an excuse about being tired... If somebody says so, then its a white lie... Its a demanding format, but if you spot me looking tired in a T20 match, then youve got to blame me... If somebody doesnt give a hundred per cent because hes tired, then that spoils the party for me...         
	Two IPLs a year being planned         
	If we arent playing a second IPL, you will find us playing in some series or the other... Its tough to keep us silent for a long time.         
	Finally, message for fans         
	Were more disappointed than them... We respect their emotions and India is a very emotional country... Were sorry for them, but I can say that we gave our best, yet lost... Theres nothing to hide... Performing well in the West Indies will be a consolation (of sorts).

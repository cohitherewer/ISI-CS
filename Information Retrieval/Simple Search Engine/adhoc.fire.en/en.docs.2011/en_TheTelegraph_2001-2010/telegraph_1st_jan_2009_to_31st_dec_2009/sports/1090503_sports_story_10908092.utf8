The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvis wicket was crucial: Kumble
                                                   Yuvis wicket was crucial: Kumble
                      
	Durban: Kings XI Punjab captain Yuvraj Singhs performance on Friday had almost taken away the match from them, feels the Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Anil Kumble.         
	The ball was stopping and coming and Yuvraj likes pace on the ball. I wanted to take the pace off and that worked. Yuvi was going great guns and if he had been around for five overs more, he could have taken the game away from us, Kumble said after the match.         
	Yuvraj notched up the first hattrick of the second edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) and also scored a blistering 33-ball 50 on Friday. But his efforts were not enough as the Kings XI Punjab suffered a narrow 9-run defeat against the Royal Challengers.         
	Kumble gave credit to Roelof van der Merwe for helping the Royal Challengers post a competitive total, even after losing three wickets in three balls.         
	It was a great game. After losing three wickets in three balls, I thought Roelof (van der Merwe) batted brilliantly to get us to 145. Everybody rallied around him. It was a great show by our bowlers, he said.         
	Merwe scored a quickfire 35 off 19 balls, studded with three boundaries and three sixes.         
	Kumble also lavished praise on Praveen Kumar for his crucial over in the end.         
	It was tough to grip the ball because of the dew. Praveen has the experience and he bowled effectively, he said. Disappointed with the loss, Yuvraj said that their opponents played a better game.         
	We played good cricket but at the end, they were better. We bowled well, we had a good score to chase but we could not do that. Hopefully we can do it next time, he said.

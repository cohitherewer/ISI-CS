The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India women open vs Pakistan today
                                                   India women open vs Pakistan today
                      
	Sydney: The traditional India-Pakistan rivalry will once again come to the fore on Saturday when they meet in the second match on the opening day of the Womens World Cup. India will look to replicate their impressive performance in the last edition of the tournament (2005) when they reached the final.         
	India have a new captain in Jhulan Goswami. Losses in England and Australia, prior to the World Cup, have dented their confidence somewhat, but with a fine mix of youth and experience the team will look to turn things around.         
	India, though, shouldnt look back to their record in Australia as they havent done well there in past tours. They have failed to win any of the five Tests they played here since 1977, and lost all eight ODIs since 2006.         
	They had the chance to play in two World Cup venues  North Sydney Oval and Manuka Oval  when they toured in October 2008, but could not score more than 180 runs or take more than six wickets in any of the matches.         
	Mithali Raj will be the mainstay of the Indian batting line-up. Anjum Chopra, playing her fourth World Cup, will be handy with her experience as well.         
	Goswami and Rumeli Dhar, both of whom were there during the last World Cup, will be in charge of the bowling department.         
	For Pakistan, who are playing their first World Cup since 1997, India will be a tough opponent first up.         
	In the other match on Saturday, England meet South Africa in Canberra.           (AGENCIES)

	Calcutta: Grandmaster Surya Sekhar Ganguly, who won the gold medal at the Asian Continental Chess Championship in The Philippines, said he was elated at having clinched a ticket for the World Championships in Siberia. Im very happy with my performance in the Asian championship because it earned me a place in the World meet. Its certainly a great achievement, he said.         
	Ganguly attributed his success to the hard work he put in the last few months.         
	The last tournament I played was in Gibraltar, and that was quite some time back I prepared a lot for this meet and its good that it has paid off. Sandipan Chanda was my practice partner and it really helped in my preparations, said Ganguly, who returned to the city on Tuesday.         
	He also revealed that he had to play quite a few tough matches in The Philippines. The match against the Vietnamese Grandmaster was not at all easy, he said.         
	Ganguly, who was world champion Viswanathan Anands second during the Bonn World Chess Championship, said that his stint alongside the world champion was very fruitful. Being his second and watching him from close quarters was a bonus from me. Ive learnt a lot from him, said Ganguly. He added that he has received a congratulatory message from Anands wife, Aruna.         
	He said that he would concentrate on the Canadian Open, which is in July, next.         
	He was also a bit worried with the climate of Siberia, the venue for the World Championship in November, as he said: The cold over there may be a problem but I will cope with that.

                                                   Gambhir: Lucky to have Warner
                      
	Johannesburg: The Delhi DareDevils would have a problem of plenty with the opening slot when regular captain Virender Sehwag returns, stand-in skipper Gautam Gambhir said on Sunday.         
	Gambhir and Sehwag, who have been opening for the DareDevils since the first match of the Indian Premier League (IPL), were separated on Saturday when Sehwag was forced to pull out with an injury. His replacement David Warner scored a 40-ball 51 on his IPL debut.         
	Asked about the team composition for Tuesdays match against the Kolkata Knight Riders in Durban, Gambhir admitted there was an issue to deal with.         
	We havent decided as yet. Once Sehwag is back, then well decide about the team composition, particularly on the openers, Gambhir said.         
	Gambhir admitted that Sehwags absence was not felt because of Warners red hot form.         
	The way Viru demolishes the attacks from the word go, we knew we are going to miss him. But fortunately we had Warner in the squad. The way he batted was wonderful, and making a 50 on his debut was great, Gambhir said.

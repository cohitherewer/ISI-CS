                                                   Sri Lanka to split Pak tour for India: Report
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Karachi: Sri Lanka would split their tour of Pakistan to accommodate a hastily-scheduled one-day International series against India next month, reports said Sunday.         
	The report quoted sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) as saying talks were on to work out an arrangement under which Sri Lanka would tour Pakistan in the third week of this month to first play five one-day Internationals and a Twenty20 match. They would then return for the one-day series against India and complete it by February 18 before going back to Pakistan to play three Tests.         
	Sri Lankan sports minister Gamini Lokuge also confirmed that he was discussing the series with the BCCI.         
	We are about 60 per cent certain that we could arrange a series for the Sri Lanka team with India shortly.         
	We have had successful discussions with the Indian cricket board and at the moment we are finalising the schedule, Lokuge said.         
	However, the Board of Control for Cricket in India denied that an ODI series in Sri Lanka was being organised.         
	We are not aware of any such plan. I dont know how this kind of a story has been generated, Ratnakar Shetty, chief administrative officer of the BCCI, said.         
	N. Srinivasan, secretary of the BCCI, said: We do not disclose such details to individuals. If there is any plan, we would issue a press release.         
	The present scenario is a result of India cancelling a scheduled Test tour of Pakistan from January 4 to February 21 to play three Tests, five one-dayers and a Twenty20 match.         
	Indias cancellation of their Pakistan tour has left all three South Asian countries with a window to play in January and February, a PCB source was quoted as saying by the report.         
	Even the PCB is not averse to a split tour but they need to convince Bangladesh to delay the one-day series between the two countries scheduled from March 3 to second week of the month.         
	If Sri Lanka come for the Test series around February 20, they would require at least 21 days to play three Test matches after which Pakistan can go to Bangladesh for the one-day series, the PCB source said.         
	The BCCI has incurred a loss of Rs 120 crore because of cancellation of the two ODIs against England and the tour to Pakistan in the wake of the terror attacks in Mumbai.

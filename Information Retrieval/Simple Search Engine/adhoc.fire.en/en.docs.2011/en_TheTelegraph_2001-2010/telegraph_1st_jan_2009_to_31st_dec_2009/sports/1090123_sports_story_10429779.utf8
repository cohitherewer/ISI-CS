The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No takers for Pak players
                                                   No takers for Pak players
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The ripples of recession and the aftershocks of the Mumbai terror attacks are being felt in the Indian Premier League.         
	As the month-long trading window for players closed on Thursday, not one of the Pakistani cricketers put up for auction have found buyers.         
	In all, only four players were traded. And those two sets of transfer involved a cashless swap that worked out to the benefit of the participating cash-strapped corporates.         
	When the trading window opened on December 22, most franchises had been eager to offload their non-performing Pakistani players given the tenuous bilateral ties at present. But eventually somebody has to be prepared to buy them and nobody seemed interested, said an IPL source.         
	That has left most franchise owners with players nobody wants. Shah Rukh Khans Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) began by registering Pakistani pacer Shoaib Akhtar for trading. Their next list had Salman Butt and Mohammed Hafeezs names.         
	Our team has four Pakistanis. Umar Gul performed exceedingly well last year, but in the prevailing conditions, we are not sure if they will make it. Visas, for one, may not be granted. It makes sense to cut risk, so the other three were on the trading window. We have to take a call on them now. As a first the possibility of re-signing Hafeez, who had a one-year contract, is very thin, said a KKR official.         
	Hyderabads Deccan Chargers, who finished last in the first IPL season, wanted to get rid of Shahid Afridi. But there were no takers.         
	Delhi DareDevils though have been able to get rid of the drug-tainted Mohammed Asif.         
	The only franchise untouched by the Pakistani cricketer issue is Mumbai Indians. They were also the only team that was able to trade two players at the auction.

	Calcutta/Melbourne: Australia captain Ricky Ponting feels the controversial Decision Review System (DRS) should have been trialled in one-day and Twenty20 cricket before being introduced in Tests as the innovation still needs some refinement.         
	Ideally, a lot of those things with rule changes, weve brought into 50-over cricket over the last couple of years. Ideally youd like to have trialled them elsewhere, Ponting was quoted as saying by an Australian daily.         
	In the last 12 months, the review system was used that was more a trial period. We know that its going to be used in every Test series from now on. I still think theres some refinement that can be done with the actual technology thats used, he said.         
	DRS is being used in the ongoing Test series between Australia and the West Indies. Meanwhile, Australia have retained the squad that played the second Test. The third Test starts on December 16, according to a Cricket Australia release.

	Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke, Doug Bollinger, Brad Haddin, Nathan Hauritz, Mike Hussey, Mitchell Johnson, Simon Katich, Clint McKay, Marcus North, Peter Siddle, Shane Watson.

	Calcutta: Ritwick Bhattacharya is raring to go. In town for the PSA Indian Challenger squash tournament, Ritwick said he was confident of a good show in the next 12 months.         
	We have some important tournaments till the Commonwealth Games. And the way I am feeling right now, I have high expectations. I have changed my playing style and feeling fitter like never before. You can say I am building the base for my future battles, Ritwick told mediamen at the Calcutta Rackets Club on Tuesday.         
	The world No. 59 said practising in Europe is no longer economically viable. If you have a good support staff, which is not impossible, this is the best place to practice. Europe is very expensive right now.         
	Lamenting the lack of Pakistani players in the Indian squash tournaments post 26/11, Ritwick said he sympathised with players like Mansoor Zaman.         
	Mansoor, the defending champion, did not send his entry due to the escalating tension between the neighbours. The crowd I am sure would have definitely liked to see him in action. But certain things are not in our hands, he said.         
	For the record, last years runner-up Malaysian Ong Beng Hee is the top seed in the meet, which starts from Wednesday, followed by country-mate Azlan Iskandar. India No. 1 Saurav Ghosal is the No. 6 seed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Am nowhere near Sachin
                                                   Am nowhere near Sachin
                      
	New Delhi: He once said in jest that the only difference between him and Sachin Tendulkar was in their bank balances, but Virender Sehwag, a trailblazer in his own way, said Tuesday that as a batsman he can never be half of what the batting maestro is.         
	Very early in his career, Sehwag, whose height and body structure made him a Tendulkar lookalike at the wicket, had said: The only difference between us is in our bank balance. I am nowhere near him.         
	But on a serious note, Sehwag said Tuesday that he would be honoured if Tendulkar is viewed as his guru. I would be honoured if he is viewed as my guru and I as his shishya (disciple).         
	He also expressed disappointment at Sachins rating in ICCs all-time greats list. All of us (Team India members) are disappointed at how low they have placed Sachin.         
	Asked which are the qualities of Sachin he would like to have, Sehwag said: Everything. And its just not about his unique style of batting. It is his humility, his entire persona.         
	The Tendulkar of Najafgarh also said that Sachins records are unlikely to be broken.         
	I really feel his records will never be broken. For somebody to do it, he would not only need the talent and longevity but also a rare luck with injuries. And that still might not be enough.         
	He started his career at the age of 15 plus. Somebody would have to start at 14 years. The equations you need to have in your favour to get past his 83 international centuries; nearly 30,000 runs and still counting are an impossible act.

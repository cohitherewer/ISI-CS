The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | West Zone to face Zimbabwe XI
                                                   West Zone to face Zimbabwe XI
                      
	Cuttack: Heavyweights West Zone will take on the visiting Zimbabwe Presidents XI at the Barabati Stadium here on Monday to decide the finalist from Group B for the Deodhar Trophy.         
	West might have Wasim Jaffer, Ajinkya Rahane (both Mumbai) and Cheteshwar Pujara (Saurashtra) in their ranks but their batting was a concern in their first-round match against South Zone.         
	On the slow Barabati track, it was only skipper Jaffer who held on with a responsible knock to see his side put up a respectable total.         
	However, West are not taking the visitors lightly.         
	You never know in a one-day match. Till the match is not over, you cant say anything. Zimbabwe too are a good side and we have to be vigilant, West Zone coach Debu Mitra said. West are likely to retain the same squad in Mondays match.         
	The pitch in Mondays match will be the same on which West beat South in a low-scoring affair.         
	The touring Zimbabwe party are upbeat, having rubbed shoulders with the talented Indian fringe players.

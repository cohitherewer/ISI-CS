The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We failed to tackle pressure: Pollock
                                                   We failed to tackle pressure: Pollock
                      
	Durban: The Mumbai Indians chief mentor Shaun Pollock said it was unfortunate that his team buckled under pressure in the dying moments against the defending champions Rajasthan Royals in their Indian Premier League match on Thursday.         
	I think it was a pressure situation, Pollock said when asked why his team could not manage four runs from the last over.         
	From our side, we were just hoping that we would get that one big shot to close the game. Unfortunately, we couldnt manage that with new guys coming in. It became difficult with the tailenders, he was quoted as saying by the official IPL website.         
	Pollock expressed disappointment that even their experienced middle-order buckled under pressure.         
	They have been good batters over the last few years. It is a great disappointment as we have a lot of guys with experience and unfortunately it didnt go our way even when the situation required experience, he said.         
	He said the team needed to work on their weakness of failing to finish off close matches.         
	Probably we have had some close games which have gone against us. One needs to play these close games and such pressure situations and finish them off. We havent managed to do that on a couple of occasions. We have got two more games and have a chance to qualify. We have obviously learnt from it, Pollock said.         
	The former South African cricketer said rival captain Shane Warnes appearance was not a surprise for them and it did not lead to shuffling in the batting line-up.         
	No it wasnt a surprise for us... We do not take things for granted and we were not worried if he would play or not. You want to play against the best. We were glad to see him at the toss. He brings a lot to the party and unfortunately he brought too much for us today (Thursday).         
	Sachin Tendulkar had some thoughts about how to combat their bowling attack and with the bowling they had, we thought that experience in the middle-order will be the best thing. But at the end of the day, it was not the batting changes at the top order that made the difference.         
	We needed six runs from nine balls  and we would win that 99 times out of 100. It is a big blow, especially at this stage of the tournament. We must regroup now and focus on the last two games, he said. (PTI)

                                                     Plain-speaking, the Kirsten way
    - International between now and the next World T20 cant be slotted: Prof. Shetty             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Gary Kirsten                                 
	Calcutta: Most of Gary Kirstens wards are convinced hes a coach with a difference. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is probably realising that too.         
	In a different context, though.         
	After jolting the BCCI by blaming the IPL-induced fatigue and injuries for Team Indias early exit from this years World T20, Kirsten has (very publicly) made another point which cant really be ignored.         
	Its that the Mahendra Singh Dhonis wont be playing a single International between now and the next World T20, scheduled in the West Indies from April 30-May 16, 2010.         
	In fact, the June 16 match against South Africa in Nottingham will remain Indias last International before the World T20s third edition.         
	Kirsten hasnt said anything which isnt already there in black and white, but the BCCI isnt used to coaches either asking uncomfortable questions or speaking their mind on issues which it would prefer being brushed under the carpet.         
	Of course, such occurrences give some officials the opportunity to go before the cameras and grab a slice of prime time television.         
	Whether the BCCI was actually aware or not that something was missing in the 2009-10 calendar, its chief administrative officer, Prof. Ratnakar Shetty, has told The Telegraph that no T20 International can be squeezed into the programme now.         
	I dont see it happening... All (bilateral) agreements are in accordance with the ICCs Future Tours Programme and theres no provision for an International between now and the next World T20... However, the IPL will be staged before that, he pointed out.         
	Prof. Shetty added: If you remember, we won the inaugural edition (in 2007), with the experience of just one T20 International, held the previous year...         
	Agreed, but the IPL may lead to the same problems  fatigue, injuries... Worse, as was the experience this time, the Dhonis would head for the West Indies without any preparation as a team.         
	Playing for the franchises as individuals surely isnt the same as preparing collectively for the World T20. But, then, wholl make the BCCI understand that?         
	Its worth recalling what Kirsten said after Indias quick departure from this years World T20  Because we werent together as a unit, we came with little preparation... Wed lost the connection (during the IPL)...         
	At a time when the Shane Warnes want the 50-over ODIs scrapped, the BCCI (for one) is quick to give its blessings to such tournaments, like the September 8-14 tri-series in Sri Lanka. The difficulty, strangely, is in accommodating T20 Internationals.  
	BETWEEN SEPTember 2009 AND THE 2010 WORLD T20  
	 Tri-series in Sri Lanka (with New Zealand being the third team); Champions Trophy in South Africa; 7-match ODI series against Australia at home; 3 Tests and 5 ODIs against Sri Lanka at home; 2 Tests and a tri-series in Bangladesh (with Sri Lanka likely to be the third team); 5 ODIs against South Africa at home.

                                                   Onus on the top order: Miandad
                      
	Karachi: Pakistans former Test captain Javed Miandad believes that Pakistan can win the World Twenty20 final against Sri Lanka if their top order batsmen fire on Sunday.         
	I still say T20 cricket is very unpredictable and it is difficult to predict a winner. But from what I have seen, teams whose top three or four batsmen score big runs, perform well, said Miandad, a veteran of 124 Tests.         
	Miandad said Pakistan had done well to promote Shahid Afridi up the order.         
	I have worked with Afridi as the national team coach in the past and he has always delivered his best as a batsman when batting higher up the order. He has immense talent and is a proper match winner, Miandad said.         
	He pointed out that the top order must take responsibility for giving the team a good start. Sri Lanka is a very good side and unbeaten in the tournament. They have been given great starts by Tillekaratne Dilshan who has been their biggest plus point, he said.         
	The former captain was confident that the Pakistani batsmen could tackle the Sri Lankan spin duo of Ajantha Mendis and Muttiah Muralidharan.         
	They have played a lot against Muralidharan and they know Mendis well. I think the secret to success in T20 cricket is to decide beforehand which bowler to target, Miandad said.

                                                   Army not Pandeys choice any more
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Royal Challengers Bangalore batsman Manish Pandey, after becoming the first Indian to slam a century in the ongoing second edition Indian Premier League, is convinced that he is made to fire with bat rather than firing bullets in the battlefield.         
	Pandey Thursday smashed a scintillating unbeaten 114 as the Royal Challengers Bangalore secured a semi-final spot after beating the Deccan Chargers by 12 runs. Pandey, who whacked only the second century of the ongoing IPL, said joining Army was second career option for him but now he need not pursue that.         
	I think the plan has changed now. I just had an option that if cricket would not work for me then I would join the Army, he was quoted by the official IPL website.         
	The youngster said it was skipper Anil Kumbles backing and coach Ray Jennings faith that did the trick for him in the high-pressure match.         
	In the team meeting he (Kumble) told me that I would open the innings today. He said he has faith in me and told me to back my abilities. He said the track looked good and no matter how badly I played I would still score good runs.         
	Jennings told me to play my natural game. He told me not to fear failure and to have fun in the centre, he said.         
	Pandey was ecstatic after scoring a match-winning knock. Its amazing. I just thought I would back myself today. And it worked. I realised only when I reached 87 that I could make a century here. I am happy to match AB de Villiers feat of scoring a century in the IPL tournament in South Africa.

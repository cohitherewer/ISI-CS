                                                   ITF suspends Gasquet 
                      
	London: The International Tennis Federation (ITF) suspended French player Richard Gasquet on Monday following his positive test for cocaine, pending a hearing.         
	The ITF said an anti-doping tribunal should be assembled within 60 days to hear the case. Gasquet says he is gathering evidence to prove his innocence, despite both his A and B samples coming back positive for cocaine. Traces of the drug were found in the 22-year-old Gasquets urine sample at the Sony Ericsson Open, in Key Biscayne, Florida, in March.         
	Hes suspended until the end of the hearing, ITF spokesman Neil Robinson said. Were now assembling an anti-doping tribunal. The ideal timeframe is within 60 days, but people have to fly in from all over the world for it.         
	Gasquet could face a two-year ban if found guilty. The Frenchman, who was ranked seventh in July 2007 but has since slipped to No. 21, has played just five matches since pulling out of the Sony Ericsson Open before his second-round match against Albert Montanes of Spain.         
	Gasquet cited a right shoulder injury for the withdrawal. (AP)

                                                   Md. Sp. look for full points
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: A buoyant Mohammedan Sporting would be keen to gain maximum points and move away from the relegation zone when they take on Mahindra United in a 16th round I-League match at the Cooperage on Saturday.         
	Placed second from bottom, Mohammedan have an unenviable task in their remaining seven matches but coach Shabbir Ali was optimistic of his team staying in the elite division.         
	We are in relegation (zone) but I think the championship is still wide open. There are five-six teams with only a difference of three-four points between them, so anything is possible, Ali said on the eve of the match.         
	Mohammedan have 13 points, three more than Vasco and as fewer than United SC, while rivals Mahindra and JCT have 17 points each, one less than Air India.         
	Ali said his side were getting back into some sort of form in the latter phase of the league.         
	In the first half of the season we were without the services of the two foreigners (Theodore Sunday and Mike Okoro) but we have one of them (Okoro) back now and also have Eugene Gray (as replacement for Sunday). So, things are slightly better.         
	Nobody can take any team for granted, this year has been tough. One or two matches can change things.         
	Ali had criticised his players strongly following the 3-0 loss to Mumbai FC here about a month ago, but was all praises for his wards on Friday.         
	Mohammedan should draw confidence from the fact that they beat Mahindra in the first leg, but Ali needed no such comforting thoughts. Its yesterday, over, he said.

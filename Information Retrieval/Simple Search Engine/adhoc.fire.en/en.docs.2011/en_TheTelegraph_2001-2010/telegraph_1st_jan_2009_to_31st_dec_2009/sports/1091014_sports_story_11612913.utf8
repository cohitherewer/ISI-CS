	Campo Grande (Brazil): Brazil coach Dunga predicts Argentina will reach next years World Cup in South Africa without needing a playoff.         
	Argentina play Wednesday away to Uruguay in the final round of South American qualifying. Argentina will finish fourth in South American qualifying if they wins the match, which would give it the final automatic qualifying berth. Brazil, Paraguay and Chile have claimed the first three spots.         
	Argentina can also advance automatically with a draw. Uruguay will also advance automatically if they win, but a draw would not be enough. Uruguay is going to have to go for it, and that could give Argentina lots of space to play in, Dunga said. They will be over the nervousness and will play much better.         
	Argentina salvaged a 2-1 victory on Saturday against Peru, winning on Martin Palermos scrambled goal three minutes into second-half injury time. (AP)

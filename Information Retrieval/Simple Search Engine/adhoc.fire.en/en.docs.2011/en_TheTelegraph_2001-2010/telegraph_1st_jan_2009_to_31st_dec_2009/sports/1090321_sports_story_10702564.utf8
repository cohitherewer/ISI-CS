                                                   Bhullar hits six-under
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Gurgaon: Gaganjeet Bhullar played near-perfect golf and soared to the second spot following a flawless six-under 66 in the third round of the SAIL Open at the Classic Golf Resort, here on Friday.         
	For the second day on the trot, the Kapurthala lad brought home a bogey-free round to aggregate 19-under 197 and maintained his status as the highest placed Indian in the $300,000 Asian Tour event.         
	Overnight leader Chapchai Nirats back nine birdie binge, en route to a round of seven-under 65, opened up a staggering eight-stroke lead and it would require a miracle to deny the big-hitting Thai a victory. Chapchai is now in sight of Ernies Els winning total of 31-under on the par-73 in Kapalua, Hawaii, while winning the Mercedes Benz Championships on the USPGA circuit in 2003 and Daniel Chopras winning total of 30-under at the Henrico County Championships in 2004. The Asian Tour record for the lowest winning total is 29-under set by Els at the 2003 Johnnie Walker Classic in Perth.         
	From the Indian point of view, Ashok Kumar made a good move upwards with a five-under 67 that carried him to 14-under 202 and tied 10th.         
	Shiv Kapur (69), tied 10th after second round slipped to 13th and SSP Chowrasia (68), Gaurav Ghei (69) and Rahil Gangjee (71) were tied 20th at 11-under, where the group also included Mardan Mamat (73), who slid from tied fifth to 20th.         
	Bhullar, however, did not seem too pleased with his own performance on Friday. This is a course for the taking. I have not been able to take full advantage of the par-fives, he said.         
	Only once has Bhullar missed out on a birdie on the par-fives on the first two days. In the third round, however, he could manage only one birdie from the four par-fives.

	Every state association that will stage a match during the 2011 World Cup will be paid a special package of Rs 4 crore for organisational purposes by the Board of Control for Cricket India (BCCI). The decision was taken at the working committee in Mumbai on Friday.         
	The BCCI has decided to allocate this amount to the staging associations, an official said on Friday.         
	Besides, all the state associations will be getting a share of the revenue earned during the recently concluded two T20 Internationals in Nagpur and Mohali.         
	It was decided that the BCCI will be handing over a lump sum to Vidarbha Cricket Association and Punjab Cricket Association to meet their expenses for organising the matches. The rest of the amount, including that earned from TV rights, will be equally distributed among all the other units, he further added.         
	No decision was taken regarding the series versus South Africa, but Jaipur, Kanpur and Ahmedabad have come up as the likely venues for the three one-dayers next year.         
	For the two Test matches, Nagpur and Calcutta are still the front-runners. Bangalore is also being considered along with Delhi. The venues will be decided once the tours, programmes and fixtures committee meets in the first week of January.         
	A decision was also taken that any association that declines an international match (Test or ODI) will now come last in the rotation policy.

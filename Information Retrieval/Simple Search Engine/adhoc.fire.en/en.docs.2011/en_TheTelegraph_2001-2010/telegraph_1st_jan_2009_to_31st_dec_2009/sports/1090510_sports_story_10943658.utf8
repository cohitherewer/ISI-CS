	 Calcutta: The umpire referral system will be up for review in the International Cricket Council (ICC) cricket committees annual meeting at Lords on Monday and Tuesday which among others, will also discuss the feasibility of day/night Test cricket and ways to improve over-rates.     
	The meeting, to be chaired for the first time by ex-West Indies captain Clive Lloyd, who replaced former India captain Sunil Gavaskar, will also consider whether there should be a maximum weight of bats at the international level and the effect of double-sided bats and switch-hits on the game.          
	New Delhi: The sports minister, M.S. Gill said on Saturday that the mobile phone based contest in the Indian Premier League (IPL) may increase the possibilities of betting in cricket.     
	In a strongly worded statement the minister said the contest was openly encouragingly gambling and betting. Gill said it was the duty of the BCCI to protect the future of the game.         
	Kimberley: The Chennai Super Kings coach Stephen Fleming has rejected John Buchanans suggestion of increasing the number of overseas players in the playing eleven, saying that the IPL is not a global competition and is meant to promote Indian players.

	Rome: Rafael Nadal won his record fourth Rome Masters title on Sunday, beating defending champion Novak Djokovic 7-6 (2), 6-2. This was the third clay-court title in three weeks for the top-ranked Spaniard, following victories at the Monte Carlo Masters and the Barcelona Open. Nadal extended his winning streak on clay to 30 matches, stretching back to an opening-round loss to Juan Carlos Ferrero in Rome last year.         
	By failing to defend his title, Djokovic will lose the No. 3 ranking to Andy Murray on May 11, when last years points drop out. The 21-year-old Serb has been No. 3 since August 2007.         
	Nadal broke an Open Era tie with Thomas Muster, who won Rome titles in 1990, 1995 and 1996. Jaroslav Drobny and Martin Mulligan also each won three titles before the Open Era began in 1968. Chris Evert holds the womens record at the Foro Italico with five titles.         
	Rome is a key warmup for the French Open, which begins in three weeks. Nadal has won the last four titles at Roland Garros.         
	Djokovic performed an imitation of Nadal during the trophy presentation, rolling his sleeves up, pulling his shorts down slightly and reaching down to arrange his socks as Nadal does before every point.         
	I cant win on the court but I win the impression contest, said Djokovic, who eliminated Roger Federer in the semi-finals.         
	Nadal broke serve in the opening game of the match but Djokovic had his chances in the first set before losing control for good in the tiebreaker, sending a weak backhand drop-shot attempt into the net on Nadals third set point. Djokovic then double-faulted to hand Nadal a 4-2 lead in the second set.         
	The match was a far cry from the Monte Carlo final two weeks ago, when Djokovic became the only player to take a set from Nadal on clay this year. The match was played in alternating conditions, with wind swirling around inside the stadium when the sun disappeared for periods behind clouds.         
	Djokovic started off with a series of errors as he tried to flatten out his groundstrokes and go for winners to end rallies early. As the match wore on, he waited longer in rallies before going for winners with approach shots to the corners.         
	Still, Djokovic appeared unsure of his tactics at times. On one occasion in the first set, he attempted a serve-and-volley, but then retreated and watched Nadals winner sail by him, out of reach. Nadal uncharacteristically missed a few forehands at the end of the first set to let Djokovic pull even at 5-5.         
	However, Djokovic then missed a routine backhand into the net to drop his serve again and smashed his racket onto the clay, drawing a racket abuse warning from the chair umpire. Djokovic led 23-19 in winners but committed 40 unforced errors to Nadals 22, mostly with his backhand.         
	Nadal improved his Rome record to 22-1. His won his first two titles in 2005 and 2006 with victories over Guillermo Coria and Roger Federer, respectively, then beat Fernando Gonzalez in straight sets in 2007.

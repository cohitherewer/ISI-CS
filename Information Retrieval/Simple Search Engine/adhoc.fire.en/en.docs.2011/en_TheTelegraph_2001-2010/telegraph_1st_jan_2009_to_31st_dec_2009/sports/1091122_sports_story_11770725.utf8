The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tickets not up for sale 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tickets not up for sale 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Its official that, owing to the renovation underway at the Eden for the 2011 World Cup, there will be no priced tickets for the December 24 India-Sri Lanka one-day International. The quota of allotted tickets for the affiliated clubs have also been slashed by 80 per cent.         
	Four blocks  B, C, K and L  have been dismantled at the Eden and the stadium, at present, has a capacity of around 44,700. Among these, approximately 32,700 are meant for the different members (life, annual, associate, honorary, the NCC and the golden card holders) of the association.         
	Of the remaining, around 3,300 are Club House tickets.         
	That implies that approximately 8,500 tickets will be available for the different clubs, district associations and the universities. It was also suggested that the CAB will not charge the clubs, as was the usual practice, for these tickets and they will be complimentary.         
	It was also made clear that there will be no tickets for the common man.         
	The proposal has been forwarded to the working committee, which will meet on Thursday. The sanction of the proposal at the working committee meeting is just a formality.         
	Speaking after the meeting, CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey said: We have decided not to keep priced tickets for this match as it wouldnt have made sense to sell such a few number of tickets.         
	This will probably be the first time in history that an international match will be played at the Eden sans a single priced ticket.         
	The first division clubs affiliated with the CAB usually get 300 tickets while the second division clubs and the district associations and universities are entitled for 200 and 50 tickets, respectively.         
	Therefore, under the present circumstances, the first division clubs will get 60 tickets each while the second division ones will have to be satisfied with 20 each.         
	The district associations and the universities will receive 15 tickets each.         
	The respective clubs seemed satisfied with the fact that they would be getting complimentary passes.         
	The loser, however, is the common man who used to wait patiently in the long queues at the counters in and around the Maidan to quench his love for the game.         
	For the record, it has been a long wait for the cricket lovers of the city.         
	The last time the Eden Gardens hosted an ODI was on February 8, 2007 against the same opposition. Unfortunately, the match was called off due to rain.

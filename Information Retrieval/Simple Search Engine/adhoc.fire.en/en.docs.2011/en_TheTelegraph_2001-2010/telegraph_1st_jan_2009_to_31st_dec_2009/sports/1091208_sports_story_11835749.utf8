	New Delhi: Pakistan cricketers will not play in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2010 as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has failed to obtain their visas before the deadline for confirmation of participation, IPL commissioner Lalit Modi said Monday.         
	We have been informed by the PCB that they have not been able to obtain the visas as of now. So we are not being able to extend the deadline.         
	Today (Monday) is the absolute deadline for confirmation of Pakistani players (who want to take part in IPL). The exchange window is day after tomorrow (Wednesday), Modi said.           (PTI)

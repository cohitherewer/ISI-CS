	Valencia: Brazilian Rubens Barrichello ended five years of frustration Sunday with an emotional victory for championship leaders Brawn GP in the European Grand Prix.         
	Barrichello, whose last victory was with Ferrari in China in September 2004, beat McLarens world champion Lewis Hamilton by 2.3 seconds on a sizzling afternoon at the Valencia street circuit.         
	Maiden points proved elusive once again but Force India put in an improved showing with Adrian Sutil 10th and Giancarlo Fisichella finishing 12th.         
	Starting 12th, Sutil moved up to fifth before his first pit stop and drove an excellent race to hang onto his 10th.         
	Fisichella, who had started 16th, had a wheel-to-wheel race with Red Bulls Mark Webber for a while and the Italian did well to finish ahead of both the Toyota cars.         
	I wish this moment could last forever. I want to stay here until Monday, said the 37-year-old Barrichello         
	Hamilton had led from pole, with Barrichello qualifying third on a heavier fuel load, but his hopes of winning for the second race in a row went out of the window when his team bungled the second pitstop. Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen finished third.         
	Championship leader Jenson Button, Barrichellos teammate, laboured to seventh place after a shocking start but, astonishingly, saw his overall lead trimmed by just half a point to 18 with six races left.         
	The Briton now has 72 to Barrichellos 54 and 51.5 for Red Bulls Australian Mark Webber. Mercedes-powered Brawn have 126 points in the constructors standings, with Red Bull on 98.5.         
	Webber finished out of the points in ninth place while German teammate Sebastian Vettel retired with a blown engine after a similar failure in pre-race practice. He has 47 points.         
	Barrichellos victory was the 10th of a career that started in 1993 and the Brazilian, the oldest driver on the grid until Luca Badoer was drafted in at Ferrari to replace the injured Felipe Massa, was ecstatic.         
	Its fantastic, said the Brazilian, whose career had looked to be over when Brawns predecessors Honda pulled out in December. Its been a weekend I will never forget, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC blames WICB for Antigua farce
                                                   ICC blames WICB for Antigua farce
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) has been held responsible by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for the abandoned Test at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua. The announcement came after the second day of the Chief Executives Committee meeting in Johannesburg.         
	The committee reconfirmed that the responsibility for ensuring that a venue is fit for international cricket rests with the host member board. Until now, the WICB was reluctant to accept that it, and not the local board, was at fault.         
	The meeting also agreed that all boards would be required to notify the ICC in February of each year the identity of all venues they intended to use for international matches in the following 12 months, an ICC statement said.         
	The above notification would be accompanied by a written declaration signed by the member that those grounds it nominated complied with the standards expected of an international venue.         
	With regards to the outfield in Antigua, this is currently the subject of an ICC investigation and the WICB has been asked to submit its own report.         
	The ICC has the power to impose a sanction ranging from a warning or a fine up to a suspension of international status for the venue.         
	The ICC also decided to increase the prize money on offer for the Reliance Mobile ICC Test Championship table. Currently $175,000 is earmarked for the side that tops the table on April 1 each year, with $75,000 for the side placed second at that time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Retiring helped: Hayden 
                                                     Retiring helped: Hayden 
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Matthew Hayden                           
	Calcutta/Melbourne: Australian opener Matthew Hayden has credited his sizzling form in the Indian Premier League to his international retirement, saying that being free from never-ending cricket has helped him remain fresh for the Twenty20 event.         
	The only reason that Im playing the way I am now is because I have retired. I have been able to let go of the fact that I dont want to play international cricket, he told a cricket website.         
	I know that Ive only got a very short time playing cricket in this particular period, so Ive got all my mind, skills and fitness towards the IPL, he added.         
	Incidentally, Hayden had told The Telegraph late last month that his life, post retirement from international cricket, has been a lot more relaxing.         
	It has been a lot more relaxing, thats for sure... Havent faced the grind of what used to be the schedule while playing for Australia... I continue to train hard, though... Thats a part of life I havent left behind... Ive been having a lot of fun at home... Today, Im able to be a dad to my kids (Grace, Joshua, Thomas), Hayden had said.         
	Asked what has been his motivation while playing for the Super Kings in the IPL, he had said: The T20 game... Its great if an opening batsman can have the freedom to play his shots from the first ball... Its a great way to express yourself... Ive been the dominating type and Id always like to express myself, so the T20 game suits me perfectly. In fact, because of the freedom Id get, Id enjoyed ODIs more than Test cricket in the last few years of my career.         
	Hayden said many of his peers form and fitness get affected by playing continuous cricket.         
	This is not the case with most other international players, who know they will leave this tournament and head straight to the Twenty20 World Cup, and then another international series, then the domestic cricket next summer  it is just never-ending cricket, he said.         
	In nine matches for the Chennai Super Kings, Hayden has scored 426 runs at an average of 47.33.         
	During this tournament Ive spent more time on the ocean than I have on a cricket field. It does give me an edge, because in a tournament which is played over half a day and when you play every other day, there is a lot of time spent on thinking cricket. You need to have a balance in life, he said.

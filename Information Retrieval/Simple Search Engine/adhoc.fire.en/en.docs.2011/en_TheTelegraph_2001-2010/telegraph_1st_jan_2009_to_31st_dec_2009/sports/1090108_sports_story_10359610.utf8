The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | McGrath praise for Siddle 
                                                   McGrath praise for Siddle 
                      
	Sydney: Peter Siddles five-wicket haul in the first innings of the Sydney Test against South Africa has impressed Australian pace legend Glenn McGrath who feels the standout performance will help the pacer cement his place in the team.         
	I hadnt seen much of Peter at all before he played Test cricket but the way he runs in hard, hits the deck and bowls good pace, Ive been very impressed with him, said McGrath.         
	Peter got his first five-for and, (while) it may cement your spot in a team, I think for you personally it feels like you actually belong there; you deserve to be there, the former pace great said. (PTI)

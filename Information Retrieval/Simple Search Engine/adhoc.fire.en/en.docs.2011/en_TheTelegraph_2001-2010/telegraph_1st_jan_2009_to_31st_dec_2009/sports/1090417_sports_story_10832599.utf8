                                                   Adapting to conditions is key: Pollock
                      
	Bloemfontein: Bowlers who are not familiar with South African conditions will face tough challenge adapting to the bouncy pitches here during the second season of the Indian Premier League, feels Mumbai Indians mentor Shaun Pollock.         
	Pollock believes for those who are new to conditions in South Africa, bowling in the right areas will be a major concern. It will be just as big a challenge as we faced when we went to India for the first time. It will require the bowlers to adapt a little, the former South African fast bowler and captain was quoted as saying by a website.         
	Pollock said that he was not worried about Mumbai Indians bowlers ability on South African conditions as they have some seasoned campaigners.         
	Besides South African pacer Ryan McLaren, Mumbai Indians have Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh, Dwayne Bravo (West Indies), Kyle Mills (New Zealand) and Dilhara Fernando (Sri Lanka), all of whom have experience of playing here.

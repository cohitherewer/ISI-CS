The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal players want contracts
                                                   Bengal players want contracts
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Taking a cue from the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias contract system for India players, some senior Bengal cricketers suggested to the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) Tuesday that a similar system be put in place at the state level.         
	The CAB joint secretary, Biswarup Dey, declined to name the players who came up with the suggestion.         
	He only said: Ive informed them that the matter would be taken up with the president for consideration.         
	Dey, who met the Bengal probables on Tuesday for a brief interaction, said that the players have been informed about certain guidelines that the association wants them to follow. They were asked to concentrate on co-ordination, co-operation and discipline. They wont be allowed to speak to the media without prior permission. Neither can they participate in unofficial meets during the season, he summarised.         
	Ex-Indian Cricket League player Shib Sagar Singh, who was absent from the meeting on Tuesday, has been asked by the CAB to explain his absence. Coach Roger Binny will join the camp on Wednesday.         
	Meanwhile, Abhisekh Jhunjhunwala has reportedly been admitted to a hospital with fever.

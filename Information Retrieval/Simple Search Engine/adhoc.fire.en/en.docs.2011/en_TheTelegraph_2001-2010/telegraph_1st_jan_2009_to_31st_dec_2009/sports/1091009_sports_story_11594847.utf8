The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Narrow victory for India Blue
                                                     Narrow victory for India Blue
                  Ashok Dinda                     
	Nagpur: Suresh Kumar scored a match-winning 87 to help India Blue beat India Red by one-wicket in a nail-biting contest at the NKP Salve Challenger Trophy cricket tournament Thursday.         
	Suresh first shared a crucial 57-run fourth wicket stand with Harbhajan Singh (36 off 36) and then added 55 alongwith Mahendra Singh Dhoni (37 off 40) to set the platform for the run chase.         
	Out-of-form Ishant Sharma and leg-spinner Ravindra Jadeja were the pick of the bowlers for India Red. While Ishant answered his detractors in style, picking up four wickets for 56 runs from his 10 overs, Jadeja scalped two, giving away 36 runs.         
	Earlier, Harshad Khadiwales 51-ball 55 and Ishant Jaggis 54, India Red posted a competitive 248 runs.         
	For India Blue, Bengal pacer Ashok Dinda and Harbhajan picked up three wickets apiece, giving away 52 and 40 runs respectively to bowl out the Red team in 44.4 overs.         
	India Blues run chase, however, did not start on a good note as they lost their first three wickets with team score at 49. But Harbhajan along with Suresh set the stage for the others to follow.         
	Dhoni also chipped in with useful contribution at the middle, hitting two boundaries in his 40-ball stay at the crease.         
	The match, however, went to the wire when Jadeja got dangerman Yusuf Pathans (15) wicket with India Blue requiring 24 more runs to win with three wickets in hand.

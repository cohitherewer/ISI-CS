                                                   Cakewalk for Kateryna
                            
	New York: Kateryna Bondarenko reached her first Grand Slam singles quarter final on Monday, annihilating Argentinas Gisela Dulko 6-0, 6-0 in the fourth round of the US Open.         
	Late arrivals on Arthur Ashe would have missed the Ukrainians 47-minute breeze against an error-strewn opponent who knocked out her seeded older sister Alona in the second round.         
	I just got some messages to do the revenge for my sister, so I start to think about it when I read the messages, Bondarenko told reporters. Im surprised that its 6-0 6-0, and Im really happy that it went that way.         
	With no seeds left in the top quarter of the draw, Bondarenko has a golden chance to reach the semi-finals of what has been an unpredictable tournament.         
	In the mens singles, French Open finalist Robin Soderling advanced to the last eight stage at Flushing Meadows for the first time after his opponent, Nikolay Davydenko, retired with a leg injury.         
	Soderling, seeded No. 12, was ahead 7-5, 3-6, 6-2 on Monday when the eighth-seeded Russian called off the match. Trainers had been working on Davydenkos left hamstring during a break early in the third set.         
	Before this years French Open, Soderling had never advanced beyond the third round of a major. At Roland Garros, he upset four-time defending champion Rafael Nadal in the fourth round. Soderling also reached the fourth round at Wimbledon.         
	Earlier on Sunday, second seed Andy Murray joined the mens clique still alive for the Opens second week, along with sixth seed Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina, French seventh seed Jo-Wilfred Tsonga, Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain and Chiles Fernando Gonzalez.         
	Li Na beat Italys Francesca Schiavone 6-2, 6-3 in the womens side.         
	Nadal knocked off Spanish compatriot and childhood friend Nicolas Almagro 7-5, 6-4, 6-4 in a third round match but the southpaw drew the most attention when he was off the court.         
	While trailing 2-1 in the third set, the muscle-bound Nadal was flat on his back on the sideline having his stomach taped by tournament medics.         
	Nadal, a 23-year-old with tendinitis in both knees, is looking to complete his career Grand Slam but that may be too tough a task with an injury-wracked body.         
	The Majorca native was giving no clues as to the extent of his latest misery, believed to be a problem with his right abdominal muscle that first surfaced in Cincinnati last month.         
	Murray, the Open runner-up in 2008, needed only 90 minutes to extinguish American Taylor Dent 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 and set up a fourth-round encounter with Croat Marin Cilic.         
	The Scot was pleased with his tournament run so far, having beaten Ernests Gulbis of Latvia, Chiles Paul Capdeville and the missileserving Dent. I played three pretty different players, he said. First one was a big sever who stayed at the back. Second one didnt hit the ball that big, but really had nothing to lose. Taylor obviously is a serve and volleyer.

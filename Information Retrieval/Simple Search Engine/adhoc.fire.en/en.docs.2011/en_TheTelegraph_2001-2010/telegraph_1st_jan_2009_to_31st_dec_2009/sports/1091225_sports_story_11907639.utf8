    - A Telegraph special 
  -  Two former captains pick their Dream XIs             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                                    Dilip Vengsarkar      
	Calcutta: Former India captain and a member of the 1983 World Cup-winning squad, Dilip Vengsarkar, listed his Dream ODI XI for The Telegraphs readers.         
	Vengsarkar has, by the way, also been a chief selector.         
	The following is Vengsarkars line-up, specific to India, in batting order:         
	SACHIN TENDULKAR: Indias greatest in all formats of the game... An absolute match-winner, capable of setting the agenda from the very beginning. Its natural that he should open.         
	SOURAV GANGULY: An outstanding batsman, very attacking... Had the full range of shots and formed a formidable and hugely successful opening partnership with Sachin.         
	VIRENDER SEHWAG: Hes such an explosive player, who can tear any attack to pieces. The right man to be at No.3, should one of the openers fall early.         
	POLLY UMRIGAR: By all accounts, he was a hard-hitting batsman who could also be used as a bowler (off-spin mainly)... An all-rounder, really. Hed be the one to take charge from the 20th to the 35th overs.         
	C.K.NAYUDU: Was an excellent attacking batsman who would also bowl off-spin... Hed fit into my Dream XI as an all-rounder. Lala Amarnath and Vinoo Mankad would probably run him close.         
	YUVRAJ SINGH: Possibly the greatest striker of the ball in the present times... Can quickly change the complexion of any match.         
	SALIM DURANI: A lovely left-arm spinner and a big hitter of sixes... Would make a great No. 7.                     Mahendra Singh Dhoni      
	MAHENDRA SINGH DHONI: Hed be my captain and wicket-keeper... I like his body-language, like the way he leads from the front... He takes charge of the situation and, clearly, is an excellent leader of men.         
	KAPIL DEV: Our greatest all-rounder... Outstanding both in bowling and batting... Very good in the field, too.         
	RAMAKANT DESAI: I played him after hed retired from first-class cricket and he still was a handful... He must have been great in his prime... Had such a good action.         
	SUBHAS GUPTE: One of the greatest leg-spinners... My choice as the specialist slow bowler... Id use him and Durani, with the others chipping in for the overs of spin.         
	12th man: Mansur Ali Khan Tiger Pataudi.         
	The last word...         
	Ive picked an XI which would be able to take on any team in all conditions... Ive selected a number of all-rounders.

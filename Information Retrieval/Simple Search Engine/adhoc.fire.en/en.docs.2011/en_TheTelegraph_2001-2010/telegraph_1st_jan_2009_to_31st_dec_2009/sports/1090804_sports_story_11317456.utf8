                                                   Consolation victory for the Windies
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The West Indies secured a consolation win against Bangladesh with a commanding five-wicket win in the only Twenty20 Internationl between the two teams on Sunday at Warner Park.         
	This was a face-saving win for the West Indies, having lost the two Tests and the three one-day Internationals.         
	Set 119 to win, the hosts reached the target for the loss of five wickets in 16.5 overs, with Travis Dowlin and Devon Smith each spanking 37, even though Dowlin remained undefeated at the end, according to a release.

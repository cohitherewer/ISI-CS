The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Colts fall at last hurdle
                                                   Colts fall at last hurdle
                      
	Sydney: A late golden goal by Jason Donohoe dashed the Indian colts gold medal hopes as captain Diwakar Ram and his teammates went down 1-2 to Australia in a nail-biting final in the boys hockey event in the Australian Youth Olympics here Sunday.         
	The Indian girls, meanwhile, rose to the occasion and forced a 2-0 win over US to bag bronze.         
	The Australians started on a positive note and surprised the Indians in as early as the third minute when Kieren Govers found the net from a field goal.         
	In the second session Pramod Kumar intercepted an Antil set-up to drive home a crisp shot to level the scores.         
	The hosts struck gold in the dying stages of extra time when 20-year-old Canberra forward Donohoe found the net in the 76th minute to dash Indian hopes. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Marcos does it for Bagan 
                                                     Marcos does it for Bagan 
            A CORRESPONDENT            Marcos                           
	Shillong: It was heartbreak for hosts Lajong FC as Calcutta giants Mohun Bagan came from behind to post a 2-1 in their ONGC I-League encounter at Jawaharlal Nehru stadium here on Thursday.         
	After a barren first half which saw the hosts dominate proceedings with superb skill and grit, Lajong skipper Aibor Khongee drew the first blood converting a spot kick in the 54th minute.         
	Referee PK Bose awarded the penalty for a foul by Bagan stopper Rakesh Mashi on Lajong striker S Tuboi inside the penalty zone.         
	Having conceded the goal, the Calcutta giants upped the ante and Edeh Chidis header off a Snehasish Chakraborty delivery from the left got the green and maroon brigade the equaliser.         
	Even before Lajong could pull up their socks, Marcos Pereira fashioned the lead for his team, firing in a 30-yard freekick straight into the rival net.         
	It was the Lajong men who dominated the first session and the Calcuttans could hardly gain a foothold on a ground which according to Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa needs improvement for this kind of matches quot;.         
	Match commissioner Hardev Jadeja, in his post-match remarks, too admitted that the Bagan players had objected to the ground condition but gave full marks to the crowd, the organisers and the security arrangement.         
	The result ultimately counts and experience always matters.         
	But, I am happy that my boys managed to hold back the much-experienced opponents throughout the first session, remarked Lajong coach Stanley Rozario.

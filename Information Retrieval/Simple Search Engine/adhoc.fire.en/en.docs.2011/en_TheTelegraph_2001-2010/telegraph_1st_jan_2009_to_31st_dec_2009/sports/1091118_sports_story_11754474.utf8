The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spinners hold key: Kirsten
                                                                                                                                     Spinners hold key: Kirsten
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Kirsten                           
	Ahmedabad: Gary Kirsten feels the first Test is evenly balanced at the end of the second day. The Team India coach said at a press conference after the days play, on Tuesday, that the wicket would provide turn and the spinners will hold the key.               
	The following are excerpts               
	If he is happy with the second days outcome         
	We wouldve loved to have a few more runs. But it was a tremendous effort to get to 426 from 32 for four We will be happy with that. Sri Lanka batted well. The game is pretty even at this moment. Its a good wicket to bat on and hopefully it will start taking more and more turn. It will get better as the game goes along, and bowling last on this wicket is going to suit us.         
	Whether the wicket is responsible for the low turnout         
	Its not for me to answer         
	Virender Sehwags absence from the field for most of the day         
	He picked up an injury on his finger during fielding, but hes fine.         
	Zaheer Khans bowling         
	Its good to have him back Hes an experienced and clever bowler. He bowled exceptionally well today. Hopefully, we can continue to use his skills throughout this match and the next one. I was very happy with his bowling.         
	If there was enough reverse swing         
	We were hoping for a bit more. It did reverse a bit. In conditions like these, it helps to get the reverse. We will hopefully get a bit more in the second innings and tomorrow (Wednesday) as well. The outfield is good and the areas around the pitch are good. The ball has not been pitched consistently on the rough patches.         
	The spinners bowling         
	I thought Harbhajan bowled really well. Hes got the rhythm. I think he was happy with his performance, considering its a good wicket for batting. Amit (Mishra) has not bowled for a while. He hasnt had much match practice. We would like his rhythm to get better. I am pretty confident both of them are going to play important roles in this Test.         
	If Mishra should have been released for Ranji ties during the one-dayers against Australia, like Murali Vijay and Pragyan Ojha         
	You need to have people around and available If someone does have an ankle problem on the morning of the game, you need a substitute Amit, unfortunately, has not played much Its difficult to work it out.         
	If an extra seamer should have been fielded         
	You mean an extra seamer was missed! It looks like a good batting wicket to me. We hope the wicket will start turning and the spinners will become effective. Give it some timeIts only the second day and you are jumping the gun. We have been going in with four bowlers since the start of my stint. That gives us balance. In New Zealand, we played an extra seamer, here its an extra spinner.         
	Need for an all-rounder         
	It does help to have an extra bowling option. Its been the general belief that any of the six batsmen in your Test line up will get a big hundred for you. If you can have a bowling all-rounder who can get a big hundred, thats good. A lot of teams have played successful cricket for many years with four frontline bowlers. Yuvraj and Viru can bowl for us.         
	Tillekaratne Dilshans batting         
	They were scoring at just under four. We scored over four and that suggests the wicket is good for batting. Dilshan is a fantastic player, very talented and aggressive. Hes a dangerous player and we need to continuously work on how to get him out.         
	If the referral system, which was in use during the last series in Sri Lanka, is needed         
	I think it does have a place at some stage. What we want is consistency in decision making. We used it in Lanka last year There were pros and cons of the system. It needs to be worked out correctly and fine tuned.

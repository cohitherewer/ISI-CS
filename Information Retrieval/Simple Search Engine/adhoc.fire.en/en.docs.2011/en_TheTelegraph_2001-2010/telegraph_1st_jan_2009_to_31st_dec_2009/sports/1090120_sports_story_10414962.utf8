            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mohammedan Sporting will be hoping to move away from the relegation zone when they resume their I-League football campaign with a clash against Mumbai FC here on Tuesday.         
	With just two wins from 10 matches and only four goals to their credit, Mohammedan Sporting are languishing at 11th place in the 12-team competition. Their campaign so far has been marred by players threatening to go on strike following non-payment of their salaries.         
	The team had a minor setback off the field with coach Shabbir Ali had to return home (Hyderabad) following the sudden death of his brother.         
	Overseas player Theodore Sunday has not recovered from a ligament injury that has kept him out of most matches in the first phase. The club has now applied for a replacement, Eugene Gray who is currently playing in the Indonesian league.         
	It is a holiday on Friday in Indonesia, so we are trying to get the paper work done a day earlier. Hopefully we can have him (Gray) for the Sunday match against Air India here, team manager Bilal Ahmed Khan said.         
	Mumbai FC will be without defender James Dissiramah (double booking) and first-choice goalkeeper Kalyan Chowbey is still out after undergoing a nose surgery. Amit Singha Roy will guard the goal in the absence of Chowbey who is likely to be back for the Friday match against Mohun Bagan.         
	Tuesdays match was originally to be held on November 28 but was rescheduled following the 26/11 terror attacks.

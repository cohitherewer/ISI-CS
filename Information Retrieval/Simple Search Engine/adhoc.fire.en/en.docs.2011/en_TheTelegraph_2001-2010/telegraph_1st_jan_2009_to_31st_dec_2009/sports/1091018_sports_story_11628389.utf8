The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rain plays truant
                                                   Rain plays truant
                      
	Sao Paulo: The qualifying for the Brazilian Grand Prix was suspended due to heavy rain.         
	The second of three sessions was stopped with 12 minutes, 24 seconds left at the 4.3-kilometer (2.6-mile) Interlagos track Saturday.         
	The session had already been interrupted twice by red flags and delayed several times because of the treacherous conditions.         
	Rivers of water flooded parts of the track, and drivers had a tough time keeping their cars under control with near zero visibility.         
	Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel and defending champion Lewis Hamilton of McLaren struggled the most, failing to advance from the first session. Vettel will start 16th and Hamilton 18th.         
	Vettel refused to give up his Formula One title hopes on Saturday despite the Red Bull driver qualifying only 16th in atrocious conditions.         
	We will go out (in Sundays race) with the knife between our teeth, he told BBC television after being caught out by the heavy rain.         
	The 22-year-old German is 16 points adrift of championship leader Jenson Button with two races to go and needs to finish in the top two in Sundays race to have any chance of staying in the reckoning.         
	Button and Brazilian team mate Rubens Barrichello, the Britons closest rival but 14 points behind, both went through to the second stage of qualifying at Interlagos. (AP)

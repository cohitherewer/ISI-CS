                                                     India up to No.2 in ODIs
  - MAHENDRA SINGH DHONI'S TEAM THREE POINTS BEHIND SOUTH AFRICA
            A STAFF REPORTER            Team India players celebrate their triumph in Colombo                           
	Calcutta: India displaced Australia as the No. 2 team in the International Cricket Councils one-day rankings after New Zealand defeated the world champions by six wickets in the second one-dayer in Melbourne on Friday.         
	India, who have won nine consecutive ODIs, now have 122 rating points to be just three points behind top-ranked South Africa. The Proteas recently climbed to the top of the table at Australias expense.         
	Australia (121) have been pushed to the third place while New Zealand follow at fourth with 117 points. Pakistan are further down the ladder at fifth while England and Sri Lanka are sixth and seventh, respectively.         
	Another India win on Sunday could narrow the gap between India and South Africa to just two points as the race for the top position hots up at the end of March.         
	New Zealand, on a roll too, could move to within three points of Proteas with series whitewash against Australia.         
	The repercussions of New Zealands six-wicket win over Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground could be felt as far away as Colombo. Australia are now one rating point behind India, four behind leaders South Africa and only four clear of the Black Caps.         
	Since the ODI rankings were launched in October 2002, India have never occupied the second spot on the table.         
	But Australia can regain second spot if they win back-to-back matches against New Zealand on Sunday, in Sydney, and Adelaide, on Tuesday.         
	If they can string three wins together to take the series, they will draw level on points with South Africa, although they will still lie second when the ratings are calculated beyond the decimal point.         
	That will, of course, be the last thing on the minds of New Zealand players. Two more wins will see them overtake Australia and drop the home side to fourth on the table, while a clean sweep will take them to 122 points, just three behind South Africa.         
	Whatever happens, one thing is certain that the annual race for the top spot at the end of March is likely to go right down to the wire. Australia, who have been on the decline in the last few months, have just about managed to retain their place as the No. 1 team in the longer version of the game despite losing the Test series at home to South Africa.         
	South Africa and India are now the top challengers to Ricky Pontings team in both versions of the game.         
	In the ICC Test rankings, Australia have 126 points while second placed South Africa are on 121 and would get a chance to topple Australia when they take on Pontings men in a home series beginning later this month. India are third placed with 118 points.         
	The No. 1 ODI team on April 1 will be richer by $175,000 with the runners-up getting $75,000.

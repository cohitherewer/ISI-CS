	Colombo: Seamer Shane Bond picked up three wickets Friday to propel New Zealand to a 22-run win against Sri Lanka in their second and final Twenty20 International to clinch a 2-0 series victory.         
	The Black Caps made an imposing 170 for four batting first and then bowled tightly to restrict the hosts to just 148 for eight off their 20 overs.         
	Jesse Ryder top-scored for New Zealand with 52 runs and shared an 84-run opening partnership with Brendon McCullum, who struck an aggressive 49.         
	With a required run-rate of over eight runs per over, Sri Lanka were soon in trouble losing three wickets for 11 runs. Bond produced the first breakthrough with his fifth ball, having Tillakaratne Dilshan caught by Martin Guptill for just one run. Mahela Udawatte was then out for a first-ball duck, caught by Neil Broom off seamer Kyle Mills and shortly afterward Sanath Jayasuriya miscued a pull shot to be caught by Ross Taylor off Mills for seven.         
	Mahela Jayawardene combined with his captain Kumar Sangakkara for 67 runs off 43 balls to give Sri Lanka some hope, but off-spinner Nathan McCullum then picked up two wickets in his first over  the 11th of the innings  to put the tourists in control.         
	Jayawardene made 41 runs off 30 balls before being caught at third-man by Jesse Ryder. Three balls later, Anjelo Mathews was caught at mid-on by Taylor to reduce the hosts to 80 for five.         
	Sangakkara and Gihan Rupasinghe resisted with a 49-run partnership in 39 balls but could not keep pace with the soaring required run-rate.           (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis bristles at team scrutiny
                                                   Younis bristles at team scrutiny
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Pakistan captain Younis Khan has called the extra scrutiny of his team embarrassing following the unproven ball-tampering allegations against leading seamer Umar Gul.         
	New Zealand team officials were unhappy with the state of the ball during their emphatic ICC World Twenty20 defeat by Pakistan at the Oval on Saturday and made an informal approach to the match officials after Gul claimed incredible figures of five for six.         
	The match officials reported nothing untoward had happened to the ball but, according to Younis, it did not stop umpires Rudi Koertzen and Rod Tucker constantly checking its condition during Pakistans emphatic 39-run win over Ireland at the Oval on Monday, which sealed their progress into the semi-finals.         
	It prompted Younis to criticise the extra scrutiny on his side and took the shine off their impressive response to their defeat in the group stages by England.         
	Were not cheating and it was very embarrassing with the umpires checking the ball all the time, said Younus. Sometimes it is very embarrassing because there are a lot of cameras, so how can we cheat?         
	Pakistans dismay at the umpires reaction was more acute as this tournament is their first trip to England since they refused to continue with the final Test at the Oval three years ago because umpire Darrell Hair had also accused them of ball-tampering.         
	Pakistan were cleared of that accusation following an ICC hearing in London but, on their first return to English soil since that incident, the controversy has raged once again.         
	Why does this happen all the time in England? asked Younis. Dont talk about a bowler like Umar Gul because he has a good reputation. Why is it always about Pakistan?         
	I think we should forget about this thing and just focus on the game. There are a lot of cameras so why didnt the cameras catch us doing something?

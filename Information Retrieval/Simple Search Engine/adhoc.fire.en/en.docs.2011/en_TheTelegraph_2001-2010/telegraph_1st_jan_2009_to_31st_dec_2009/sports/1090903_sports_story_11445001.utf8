The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI president to handle IMG issue
                                                   BCCI president to handle IMG issue
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) could renegotiate a fresh deal with IMG for managing the Indian Premier League (IPL) provided the sports management firm quoted a reasonable fee, a BCCI official said on Wednesday.         
	The IPL governing council on Wednesday authorised president Shashank Manohar to sort out the controversy arising from its decision to cancel its contract with IMG.         
	At the heart of the matter was the widespread opinion among the Board members that the fee charged by IMG was exorbitant and disproportionate to the services rendered.         
	The BCCI president will negotiate with the IMG and take a final decision, Niranjan Shah, a member on the IPL governing council and secretary of Saurashtra Cricket Association, said.         
	Asked about the chances of the Board rehiring IMG, Shah said: We will agree if the fee is reasonable The (Board) members feel that Rs. 25 crore is reasonable.         
	Manohar is expected to give his report ahead of the Boards Annual General Meeting here on September 24.         
	The governing council meeting barely lasted couple of hours, indicating that the forces that were pulling in opposite directions within the BCCI had been reined in well before the proceedings began. All things were sorted out last night. (Sharad) Pawar had a word with everyone concerned, a Board source said.         
	Former BCCI president Pawar had written a letter to Manohar on Tuesday, saying that the decision to unilaterally snap ties with IMG was neither desirable nor appropriate.         
	However, another source in the BCCI said that Pawars letter would not be a factor in Manohars decision.         
	Definitely Pawars words carry weight but he has written the letter as the president of the Mumbai Cricket Association. In the end, its the BCCI president who has to make the decision, the source said.         
	The source also said that the general opinion in the Board was that Pawar need not have written the letter. He could have just called the president, the source said.         
	Asked about finding out a solution to the issue, the source said it would be amicably sorted out. It is money that is the issue here. The Board members feel that the fee is a bit too high. Things should be resolved soon, the source said.         
	The BCCI last week snapped its ties with IMG, claiming the latter was overcharging them for providing its services to conduct the IPL. IMG received close to Rs 43 crore for the inaugural edition of the IPL, held in 2008, and is set to receive Rs 33 crore for this years IPL-II staged in South Africa.

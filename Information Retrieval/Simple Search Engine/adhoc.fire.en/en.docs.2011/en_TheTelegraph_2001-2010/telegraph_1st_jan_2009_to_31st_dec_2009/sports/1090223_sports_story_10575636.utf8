            A CORRESPONDENT            Gary Kirsten                             
	Christchurch: Coach Gary Kirsten said India are aware of what to expect in New Zealand. The team has the right balance and the players are prepared to adapt to the conditions.         
	Kirsten said that India had a plan in place for every challenge which they could face during the 47-day tour and it was just the question of planning correctly and doing the basics right.               
	The following are excerpts               
	The wickets in New Zealand         
	We are aware of what to expect and are planning for that. Every wicket is different. Youre not going to find two wickets of exactly the same nature. So were not really focussing on the wickets, were doing the work we need to do, and looking to adapt to situations that were confronted with. Our team is well balanced, our seamers have done particularly well last year. Everyones talking a lot about the wickets but the wickets I saw in the games against the West Indies seemed to play really well. Its not something thats concerning us too much.         
	The dismal performance on the last tour here         
	The last tour here was six-seven years ago. We dont focus on the past. We are focussing on the future and the tour that were on. In our team meetings, were certainly not talking about what happened here six years ago.         
	On the Indian teams excellent run         
	We played 17 games of cricket since September last year and lost one, so were happy with the way the performances have gone. But this team doesnt focus on past performances. If we plan well enough, well give ourselves the best chance of winning.         
	If the team has the right balance         
	The balance is good. But the game of cricket is such that any time you can have a bad hour or bad couple of hours. Were very humble around that fact and just want to make sure that we do what we need to do. We know we need to do certain things to set ourselves up to win a game of cricket. You dont just walk out onto the park and just because you have a good side on paper, win a game of cricket. Someones got to work hard out there. Everyone wants to make a contribution to the game. Its very satisfying.         
	On opponents New Zealand         
	We know what theyre capable of. Theyre a resilient team and in my experience, they play very well at home. They will be a formidable opposition and well prepared. We wont be taking them lightly, but at the same time, we know that if we stick to our processes well and do what we need to in terms of planning and preparation, and then execute, we can be a difficult side to beat.         
	The focus of the team at the moment         
	We stay away from too much talk. Talks dangerous  you have to go out there and do the business. The thing that we focus on a lot is to make sure the guys are learning very quickly what they need to do. The seniors are passing on whatever information they can and were doing our bit.         
	On bowling into the strong wind here         
	We practised with all the bowlers into the wind. What weve said is that every bowler is going to have to do the hard yards at some stage. Its not going to be easy but were prepared for that. Were very much focussed on what we can do as a team. We know that someones going to have to step up and do something thats not easy to do.

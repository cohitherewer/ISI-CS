	Calcutta: Ritwick Bhattacharya crashed out while Saurav Ghosal made it to the quarter finals on the opening day of the PSA Indian Challenger at the Calcutta Racket Club.         
	On Wednesday, Ritwick lost 11-7, 4-11, 4-11, 5-11 to Mohammed Abbas of Egypt in 44 minutes. The world No.42 was in control for most of the match against national champion Ritwick, ranked No.60.         
	Others who made it to the quarters were Ong Beng Hee and Md Azlan Iskandar of Malaysia, Hisham Md Ashour and Amr Swelim of Egypt, Englishman Adrian Grant and Aaron Frankcomb of Australia.         
	Ritwick, who ran out of steam after the first set, blamed it on his fitness.         
	It was a tricky match Abbas changed the pace of the match very often and that complicated matters.

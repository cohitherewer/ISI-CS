	New Delhi : India under-23 team went down to defending champions Maldives 2-0 in their last group league match of the SAFF Cup in Dhaka on Wednesday.         
	India, who had already made the last four grades, took the field without six of their regular players and conceded the first goal in the 18th minute when Ahmed Thoriq shot in front inside the box.         
	Ibrahim rounded off the tally for the Maldives six minutes before the final whistle.         
	To add to Indias woes, striker Balwant Singh received marching orders from the referee in the 62nd minute for his second yellow card offence.         
	In the semi-finals on Friday, India will play hosts Bangladesh while the Maldives will take on Sri Lanka.

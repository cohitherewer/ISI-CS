                                                   Referrals in Tests from October
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council has finally decided to roll out the umpire referral system in Tests from October.         
	The ICC board, on its first day of meeting at Lords, also decided to double the fine for slow over-rates besides agreeing to trial day/night Test cricket provided several crucial factors related to it were addressed.         
	The Umpire Decision Review System (UDRS) should be rolled out in Test cricket from October 2009, said an ICC statement. ICC president David Morgan said the cricket committee received the draft of Future Tours Programme post-2012 which would be refined by the ICC and members nations. The current FTP concludes in May 2012 and the draft proposals for a new programme was made following bi-lateral and multi-lateral discussions between members ahead of the meeting.         
	On slow over-rates, the ICC said fines imposed under the Code of Conduct be doubled and captain of a side guilty of three over-rate fines in the same format of the game in a rolling 12-month period should be automatically banned for one match.         
	The ban will be applicable in the next match played by his side in that same format.         
	It also said members should be far more diligent in ensuring delays within their control, such as sightscreen issues, are minimised. The team over-rates (including permitted allowances) would be displayed on scoreboards to ensure everyone was aware of the situation at all times.         
	The ICC agreed to explore the possibility of day/night Test cricket but said factors like successful trials of an appropriate ball; research on whether or not it was what stakeholders want; and successful trials at first-class level should be addressed.         
	The other decisions at the meeting were:         
	The ICC ruled that stricter penalties should be imposed on boards and venues found guilty of producing pitches considered poor or unfit. It was also agreed the term poor would include batsmen-friendly featherbed surfaces which, it was felt, were a serious threat to the game.         
	The committee also decided that play should only be suspended for bad light when umpires considered conditions unreasonable or dangerous (rather than as is currently the case, unsuitable) and that the umpires would make that decision rather than offer the batsmen the option to choose.

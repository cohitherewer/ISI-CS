The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We have to bat well: SL coach
                                                                                                                       7                                      We have to bat well: SL coach
            A STAFF REPORTER                                Ajantha Mendis at the Eden on Wednesday        
	Calcutta: Trevor Bayliss, on Wednesday, blamed poor batting for their defeat in the third one-dayer in Cuttack, and stressed that the batsmen will have to get their act right at the Eden to keep the series alive.         
	We have to get back to scoring runs, the Sri Lankan coach told a media conference.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On being 1-2 down         
	We didnt bat well in the last game We did not score enough runs. Had we scored in excess of 300, which we were looking to do at one stage of the match, we would have had a fair chance of winning that match. So we have to get back to scoring runs so that we can put pressure on the opposition.         
	The absence of Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh         
	Theres been no bigger advantage for India than the four/five guys weve had to miss on this tour Dhoni and Yuvraj are two world-class players. But with younger players coming into the team, there will be an extra doze of energy. From an effort point of view, I dont think there will be any difference.         
	The pitch         
	Looks a very good wicket Promises plenty of runs. It might take a little bit of spin, but will help the pacers initially.         
	The dew factor         
	Obviously, its going to be a factor. But if you score enough runs batting first, you put a lot of pressure on the opposition. It does not matter if there is dew or not. The simple fact is that whatever you do  bat first or bowl first  you got to do well in the respective department.         
	If the reduced capacity at the Eden will be a let down for the players         
	The players always look forward to playing in front of as many people as possible. They enjoy playing in front of the crowd and putting up a good show. But obviously they (the organisers) are working towards the 2011 World Cup. The Melbourne Cricket Ground had to do the same thing some years ago... This is part of life.         
	Sanath Jayasuriyas chances         
	There is always a chance. We have not finalised the team yet. We will decide then.         
	Whether Jayasuriya will bat in the middle-order if he plays         
	In the last two games, we wanted to play with two real spinners. Unfortunately, that meant Sanath had to miss the bus. We will certainly discuss the options.         
	Mahela Jayawardenes form in the one-day series         
	Our top three have scored a lot of runs in this series. It normally happens with all the teams... if the top three are scoring runs, then the guys down the order dont get to do a lot of batting. He is out of runs, but certainly not out of form

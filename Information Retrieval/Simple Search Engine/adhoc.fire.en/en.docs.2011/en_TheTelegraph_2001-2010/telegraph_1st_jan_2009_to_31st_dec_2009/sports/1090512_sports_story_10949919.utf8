                                                   Robson: Backing United in Champions League
            JAYDEEP BASU                                        Bryan Robson		    
	New Delhi: Manchester United fans call him Captain Marvel. For former England coach Bobby Robson, he was the best English player of his time. One of the most decorated footballers of his generation, his playing career spanned over 22 years during which he won every major trophy on offer in English football.         
	Meet Bryan Robson, legendary midfielder of the 80s and the 90s and a former United captain who also led England to some fine victories.         
	Currently a brand ambassador for United as also the Barclays Premier League Fan of India Contest, Robson spoke to The Telegraph on Monday on a variety of topics including the forthcoming Champions League final, the English Premier League and the progress of Indian football.               
	The following are excerpts         
	His favourites for the Champions League title         
	Certainly a very difficult question. After all two teams representing singular traditions and boasting of the worlds best players will be contesting the final in Rome. Barcelona are a great side with some fantastic players in their ranks but I put my money on United because Barcelona will be weakened by injury and suspension in both defence and attack. The right back, Daniel Alves plays a crucial role with his overlaps that creates space for Lionel Messi. Midfielder Andres Iniesta also looks set to miss the final after picking up a thigh injury against Villarreal. To make matters worse for them, I believe Rafa Marquez is also ruled out for the rest of the season.         
	His views on Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi         
	Both are equally good, but Ronaldo is better. The form Ronaldo displayed last season was simply fantastic. I am sure he will be able to steer United to victory in the final at Rome. Messi too is a great player, perfectly capable of producing the unexpected. I know that like all top players Messi brings out his best in the big matches but Ronaldo is definitely the finest player in the world at the moment.         
	On the playing styles of Manchester United and Chelsea         
	The approach of the two teams is different. United play more of a passing game while Chelseas football is more physical. They have players like Didier Drogba and Michael Ballack, who loves to play the game directly. Chelseas game is effective but United, you can say, are more spectacular.         
	The secret of the English teams success in the Champions League         
	The reason is simple. The English Premier League is by far the best league in the world. Sky Television has done a great job of improving the standard of the English league. A lot of funds have been pumped in and the teams have the required finances to buy the best players in the world. No wonder the English teams are doing so well in Europe for the last few years.         
	On why England are not doing well on the international circuit         
	They are improving. Under the new coach, the team is definitely making progress. We have good midfielders like (Steven) Gerrard, (Frank) Lampard and (David) Beckham. Fabio Capello has been doing a fine job and concentrating on building a team. Failing to qualify for the Euro Cup was a big blow to us but I am sure the team will make a great comeback in the World Cup.         
	On why England still dont have players like Paul Gascoigne and Bryan Robson         
	We did well in the 1990 World Cup and people still talk about it. The present crop of players is equally good and capable of turning the tide.         
	On Indian football         
	I am aware that India have an English coach in Bob Houghton. I know Bob and he is a very good coach. No country can progress unless it has the right coaching system. The Indian federation should keep that in mind.         
	On the Goal 2011 Project         
	Its not a bad idea to keep the national team players together for a year or so before the Asia Cup. Lot of countries have done that before and it will help the Indian national team.

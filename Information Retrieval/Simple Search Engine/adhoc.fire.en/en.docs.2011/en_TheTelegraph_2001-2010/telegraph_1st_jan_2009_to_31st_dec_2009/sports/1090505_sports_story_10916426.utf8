The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Skilful players alone are not enough for results
                                                     Skilful players alone are not enough for results
            Free-kick - P.K. Banerjee    
	The triumph of Churchill Brothers in the I-League is the best thing to happen to domestic football in many years. Personally, I am very pleased with the outcome. It is the culmination of passion and planning that has resulted in victory for the Goa outfit.         
	My long association with the game has taught me one very valuable thing. A team cannot always achieve the desired results by recruiting a bunch of skilful players only. It needs huge emotional backing from the management and the fans to reach greater heights.         
	I think the emotional involvement of Churchill Alemao played a bigger role than that of Odafes in Churchill Brothers winning the I-League title. I know that his antics during Churchill matches were not always liked by the administrators of the game, but none of them could ever question his commitment to the team.         
	For 13 years, Churchill Alemao has been doing everything to take the I-League trophy home. He spent a huge amount of money, got his entire family involved in running the club and recruited top players. Yet the title eluded him all these years. I am happy that his efforts have been finally rewarded.         
	There are some people in Indian football who think that all you need to raise a successful side is deep pockets. I am sorry to say that they are an ignorant lot and have little knowledge of the game.         
	What has happened to Mumbai Football Club is proof that money is not the only recipe for success. The so-called community based club was formed with much fanfare less than two years ago. Today, all the top people have left the club and it is on the verge of closure.         
	Such a crisis will never hit Mohun Bagan, East Bengal or any other supporter-based club across the world. It is not money but the sheer power of passion that will carry these clubs through for many years.         
	Coming back to the I-League, the foreign recruits once again made all the difference. If Churchill Brothers finished three points ahead of Bagan, it was mainly because of the three Nigerians, who were in fine form. Without Odafe, Kalu Ogba and Felix Chimaokwu, the Goa club, I am afraid to say, would have finished in the middle of league table.         
	I also must congratulate Bagan for their fine showing this season. Out of the four tournaments in the domestic circuit that they featured in, Bagan won three and finished runners-up in the other. It was a great performance by any standard.         
	The only regret is that I could not spot too many emerging talents in the I-League this season. A few like Subhas Singh of Air India or Amandeep Singh of JCT did play well but they still need to go a long way to become true match winners. Otherwise, Air India and JCT wouldnt have struggled to avoid relegation.         
	National coach Bob Houghton, I believe, is set to start the national camp in June. I wont be surprised if I fail to find many new faces in the list of campers. In a country where the Youth Development Programme (YDP) is thoroughly neglected by the national federation and the clubs for many years, one cannot expect to see fresh talent too easily.         
	The All-India Football Federation (AIFF), according to newspaper reports, will spend a fortune in training the national team for the 2011 Asia Cup. Once again my humble suggestion is for the money to be used for a broad-based youth development programme. The Goal 2011 Project looks very attractive on paper but in the end it could prove to be a colossal waste of energy and resources.         
	Dear readers, please take a look at the Fifa rankings since 2000. Indias ranking has dipped considerably every year. I am not blaming anyone but the only way out is to prepare serious talent hunting projects across the country. The national and the state associations should raise a bunch of trained and dedicated talent hunters for Operation Combing.         
	Time we looked underneath the creamy layer and seriously did something for the long term development of Indian football.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sushil in trouble
                                                   Sushil in trouble
                      
	New Delhi: Beijing Olympic bronze-medallist wrestler Sushil Kumar is in trouble with the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) serving a show cause notice on him for his last-minute refusal to participate in the Dave Schultz wrestling competition in Colarado, USA.         
	Sushil, who was selected in the 30-member contingent that included 11 officials to participate in the mens freestyle category, was scheduled to leave Tuesday, but on Saturday he suddenly called up the federation office to inform that he would not be participating in the event due to injury.         
	Apparently, due to Sushils last minute refusal, the WFI failed to find a replacement for him for the event that starts Thursday. That did not go down well with the federation.           (PTI)

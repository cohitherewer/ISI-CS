The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chargers aim to bounce back vs Mumbai Indians
                                                     Chargers aim to bounce back vs Mumbai Indians
                  Adam Gilchrist                     
	Centurion: Tumbling off the top spot after three successive defeats in the Indian Premier League, Adam Gilchrists Deccan Chargers will hope to arrest their free-fall when they take on a Mumbai Indians side that would be thirsty for revenge, here Wednesday.         
	Under Gilchrist, the Chargers have looked the most high-flying among the teams this year, with four wins on the trot, including a 12-run victory against the Sachin Tendulkar-led Mumbai Indians in the first leg that placed them right at the top of the table in the early stage.         
	Then came the twist in the tale and subsequently nothing seemed to go right for the Hyderabad outfit who crashed to one defeat after another to slide down the ladder.         
	Defeats against the Delhi DareDevils, the Rajasthan Royals and the Chennai Super Kings saw them surrender pole and slip to fourth and Gilchrist would go into Wednesdays match believing he knows what it takes to beat the Mumbai side.         
	The Mumbai Indians are yet to gather any momentum in the tournament since, for them, every win has been invariably followed by a defeat. Of the three defeats so far, resting heavy on Tendulkars shoulder would be the latest that came against the Royal Challengers Bangalore, not really the mightiest of sides in the tournament.         
	Mumbais sharp looking bowling unit overnight lost its zing and sting against Jacques Kallis and Robin Uthappa  both of whom had hitherto been off-colour  and the result was a thumping nine-wicket defeat with 11 balls to spare.         
	They, however, would go into Wednesdays match with a point to prove. In case the desire to bounce back is not motivation enough, the Mumbai Indians would look forward to settling scores with the rivals who won their first round battle in Durban.         
	At the same time, an interesting side-show would pit Twenty20 crickets two most exciting opening pairs against each other. As has been on display in the tournament so far, veterans Tendulkar and Sanath Jayasuriya thrive in each others company and have spoilt the figures of many a bowler while setting the tone of the match.

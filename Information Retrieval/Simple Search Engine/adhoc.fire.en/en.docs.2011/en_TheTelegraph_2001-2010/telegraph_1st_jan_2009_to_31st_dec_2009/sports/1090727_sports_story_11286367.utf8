	Paris: Alberto Contador won the Tour de France for a second time Wednesday, and Lance Armstrong capped his return to the race with an impressive third-place finish.         
	Mark Cavendish of Britain collected his sixth stage win of this years Tour in a sprint after the 164-km course ride from Montereau-Fault-Yonne to the Champs-Elysees.         
	Over nearly 3,500 km and 21 stages of races over three weeks, Contador repelled many challenges in the mountains, excelled in the two time-trials  winning a pivotal race against the clock in the 18th stage  and won the first Alpine stage.         
	Contador, the 2007 champion, also had to battle a rearguard action within his Astana team, where the comeback of Armstrong to the Tour after three-and-a-half years of retirement raised questions about who would be the team leader. Contador began the Tour on July 4 as the pre-race favourite. At only 26 years, the Spaniard is already one of cyclings greats, having won all three Grand Tours of France, Italy and Spain.         
	He had to sit out last year because of a doping scandal at Astana that erupted before he joined.         
	Armstrong, the 37-year-old seven-time Tour champion, is the second-oldest rider to reach the Tour podium. Raymond Poulidor of France was 40 when he placed third in 1976.         
	Cavendish set his own record: no rider has ever won six Tour stages in a sprint. But Thor Hushovd of Norway beat the 24-year-old Briton for the green jersey given to the Tours best Tour sprinter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dinda let off with fine only
                                                   Dinda let off with fine only
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The CAB on Monday let off pacer Ashok Dinda with a fine of Rs 10,000 for his antics against bowling partner Ranadeb Bose on the eve of Bengals semi-final against Goa in the Vijay Hazare Trophy in Agartala.         
	A decision on the issue, which has been meandering for the last five months, was finally reached in the cricket sub-committees meeting on Monday. Both cricketers were present at the meeting.         
	Dinda, reportedly, apologised unconditionally before Ranadeb and the committee and sought forgiveness. Ranadeb was also reprimanded for speaking to the media on the issue.         
	According to sources, Ranadeb, the senior pro, was not happy with the outcome and expressed his disappointment in his close quarters. He was, however, not available for comment.

                                                   Ricky: We can win Ashes sans Symmo
                      
	Sydney: Captain Ricky Ponting says he has enough talent for Australias Ashes defence without Andrew Symonds.         
	Ponting defended the selectors choice of Watson and Andrew McDonald ahead of the 34-year-old for as all-rounders.         
	I cant personally be disappointed and we both know how good a player Andrew can be, but the facts are that he went out of the side for reasons last year, Ponting said.         
	Opportunities were given to others and they have played exceptionally well enough to keep Andrew out of the squad. Look, he will be disappointed but I have a squad of 16 players that I am very confident we can play a level of cricket that is going to be good enough to win the series, Ponting said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Imran better now, but no visitors
                                                                                                                                     Imran better now, but no visitors
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Imran Khan                           
	Calcutta: Imran Khan, the legendary cricketer-turned-politician, will remain under observation in the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital for another two-three days.         
	Imran is definitely better, by the grace of God, but he will be under observation for two-three days more... At this stage, hes not being allowed to see visitors and isnt taking calls personally, the World Cup-winning captains closest friend told The Telegraph from Lahore, some 30 hours after the emergency surgery to clear an intestinal blockage.         
	Speaking from the hospital (built by Imran in memory of his mother, who died of cancer), on Tuesday evening, the friend added: It actually was a major operation and, while its understandable that so many from all walks of life want to wish Imran in person, thats just not possible now. The doctors have put their foot down.         
	The friend insisted that nothing should be read into Imran undergoing surgery in a cancer hospital.         
	Look, the Shaukat Khanum has been set up by Imran Its a hospital with a high level of technical efficiency and, then, the doctors are known to him He probably wouldnt get the same level of post-operative care anywhere else (in Pakistan), the friend said.         
	The hospital, which is the recipient of a World Health Organisation award, is run by a trust.         
	Incidentally, the Sharif brothers, who control Punjab, are among those who have sent good wishes and flowers to Imran.         
	Till the corruption issue came up in a big way, Imran and Nawaz Sharif had been pretty close, particularly when the latter was the Punjab chief minister and Imran was captaining Pakistan.         
	Fiercely anti-establishment, Imran is a former Member of the National Assembly, from his native Mianwali.         
	Imran chose not to contest the last elections, in early 2008, as he had plenty of misgivings and didnt expect the electoral exercise to be free and fair.

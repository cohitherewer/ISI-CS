	Sentosa: Young Indian golfer Gaganjeet Bhullar on Wednesday booked himself a place in the worlds oldest Major, the British Open, by winning the international final qualifiers (Asia) for the prestigious event here.         
	The 20-year-old carded a blemish-free four-under 67 to total six-under 136. He will now be playing among the worlds elite at the British Open in Turnberry, Scotland in July.         
	Starting the day at tied eighth and four shots off the lead, Bhullar knew that he had to play the game of his life in order to stand any chance of making the trip to Scotland.         
	I actually set a target of five-under for today, although I managed to finish in four-under. But its okay. Im really happy now that Im on my way to the British Open, said a delighted Bhullar.         
	The Indian has posted three top-10s in the six events that he has played on the Asian Tour so far and credited his sports psychologist for helping to turn his game around.         
	I played really well today and its all thanks to Dr Pradeep Aggarwal who has helped me a lot in improving my mental strength. Without his help, I doubt I would have gone this far, said Bhullar, who enjoyed a round highlighted by four birdies.         
	Ive been watching the British Open since I was a kid and to actually get to play there is truly a dream come true, he added.         
	Chinas Liang Wen-chong fired a sparking 66 to secure his second appearance at the Open while Australias Terry Pilkadaris had to endure a nervous wait before learning that he had also earned his ticket to the worlds oldest Major with his 72 on the second round.         
	Australias Tim Stewart, meanwhile, had to survive a gripping play-off to earn the last of the four tickets at stake after nine players were tied at two-under at the Sentosa Golf Clubs Serapong course.         
	Among the other Indians in fray, Shiv Kapur (70) ended up a stroke adrift of the top four with a total of 141, while Rahil Gangjee retired midway through the round.           (PTI)

                                                                                                                       7                                      Rohan, Aisam win in Finland
                      
	New Delhi: Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-ul Haq Qureshi clinched their third ATP Challenger doubles title of the season after defeating Jarkko Nieminen and Henri Kontinen 6-2, 7-6 in the final in Helsinki.         
	The third seed Indo-Pak duo logged home 110 ranking points. They also became richer by Euro 6600. They had earlier won the Aachen Challenger event in Germany couple weeks back after they clinched Kohrat Open in Thailand, last March.         
	With stupendous success in three tournaments, the duo are set to continue their partnership for another season.         
	The Pakistani star attributed their success to the excellent chemistry they share on and off the court.         
	I have known him for many years and we are good friends. That has precisely helped us have an excellent co-ordination on the court which resulted in tremendous improvement in our individual game, Aisam said. We have good rapport off the court also and we stick to healthy discussions when it comes to our countries. I enjoy playing with Bopanna. Given the level of understanding we have, the success we have achieved together, we plan to play more doubles events next year, he told a private channel.         
	However Aisam will have to do without Bopanna during years last ATP Doubles Meet in Austria. Bopanna is having a slight niggle which will keep him out of action. (PTI)

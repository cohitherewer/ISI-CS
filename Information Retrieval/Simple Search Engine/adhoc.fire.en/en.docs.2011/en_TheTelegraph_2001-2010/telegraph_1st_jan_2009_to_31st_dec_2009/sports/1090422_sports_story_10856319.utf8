                  Anil Kumble                     
	Cape Town: The Royal Challengers Bangalore would be hoping to shrug off their second-match defeat and start afresh when they face the Deccan Chargers in their Indian Premier League (IPL) match Wednesday.         
	The Bangalore side, who started their journey in the second edition of the IPL in style, defeating defending champions the Rajasthan Royals by 75 runs, however, lost their second match to the Chennai Super Kings by a margin of 92 runs Monday.         
	Captain Kevin Pietersen will certainly expect another gutsy knock from Rahul Dravid, whose 48-ball 66 was the cornerstone of their victory against the Rajasthan side, while there might be some experimentation with the opening slot depending on the conditions on match day.         
	But a good foundation by the opening pair is going to be crucial for a good score or for chasing down a stiff target, especially under artificial lighting.         
	Pietersen would be there adding strength to the middle order. He would also expect star Proteas all-rounder Jaques Kallis to cash in on home advantage.         
	Their bowling department did well in the first match, skittling out the Shane Warne-led team for a paltry 58, thanks to Anil Kumbles five-for, but appeared a bit sluggish against the Chennai Super Kings in Mondays encounter.         
	The bowling line-up, comprising top South African paceman Dale Steyn and all-rounder Kallis, have to be consistent if the Bangalore team, which finished seventh in the inaugural edition, are to put the record straight this season.         
	On the other hand, the Deccan Chargers, who languished at the bottom of the table last year, started their campaign on a positive note with a comprehensive eight-wicket win against the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	The Hyderabad-based side will rely heavily upon their strong batting, with skipper Adam Gilchrist joining in-form South African Herschelle Gibbs for the opening pair.         
	V.V.S. Laxman might have lost the captaincy after last years dismal showing but the team will certainly expect some timely knocks from the stylish Hyderabad batsman with New Zealand all-rounder Scott Styris coming lower down the batting order.         
	Chargers new-ball pair of R.P. Singh, who played the wrecker-in-chief against the Shah Rukh Khan-owned side scalping four wickets for 22 runs, and the West Indian Fidel Edwards, have fine penetrative ability which is enough to have the opponents worried.         
	After their creditable show in the last match, Gilchrist will also not hesitate to depend on the bowling of Pragyan Ojha and Styris to produce breakthroughs. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saha wants to bat at the top
                                                   Saha wants to bat at the top
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Wriddhiman Saha, whom Sourav Ganguly described as an an India prospect after his excellent performance against Assam on Tuesday, said he would prefer to bat at the top of the order as that would give him ample opportunity to perform.         
	I would certainly like to open the innings in the shorter version of the game as that would enable me to get maximum time to bat, he said. Asked about his innings, which yielded 102 runs, Wriddhiman said: Souravs presence helped as it eased the pressure. My partnership with Abhishek was very helpful for the team.         
	He also credited the Indian Premier League for helping him become a better player. Sharing the dressing room with international players like Ricky Ponting taught me quite a few things. IPL has also brought us into the limelight, he said.         
	He credited his success to his mental preparation and said that he would like to continue performing to bolster his chances of an India call-up.         
	Youngster Abhishek Banerjee, who scored 68 on Tuesday, said: I am happy but it would have been better if I could have scored a century. He thanked the selectors for persisting with him. I am grateful to the selectors for giving me another chance. Some tips from Sourav also helped, he said.         
	Bengal coach Utpal Chatterjee admitted that the performance of the bowlers was not up to the mark and so Bengal cant be counted upon as the best team in the group. It wasnt a good day in office for bowlers and theres still much room for improvement.         
	Terming the target of 270 as a stiff one, he said: Initially I thought that it would be a difficult one as we managed only 241 in our last match against Jharkhand. But our batsmen performed excellently.         
	He added that the team management would like to try out either a batsman or a spinner, in place of Sourav, who would not play the next match against Tripura.

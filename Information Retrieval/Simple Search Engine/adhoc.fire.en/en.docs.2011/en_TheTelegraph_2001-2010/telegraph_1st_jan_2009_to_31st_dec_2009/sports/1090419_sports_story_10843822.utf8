The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Drogba drags Gunners down 
                                                   Drogba drags Gunners down 
                      
	London: Didier Drogba scored with six minutes left Saturday to give Chelsea a 2-1 win over Arsenal and a place in next months FA Cup final.         
	Both teams had already been hampered by shaky goalkeeping when Arsenals Lukasz Fabianski rushed out of his area to get the ball, but was beaten to it by Drogba.         
	The Ivory Coast striker scored easily into an empty net at Wembley to put the Blues into their second final in three years. Fabianski, who was playing instead of injured first-choice keeper Manuel Almunia, had been lucky not to concede a goal from a similar error in the first half and was partly at fault for Florent Maloudas 33rd-minute equaliser.         
	But Arsenal had dominated much of the opening half hour and led when Theo Walcott volleyed in a cross past Chelsea keeper Petr Cech.         
	Malouda then equalised with a low shot to the near post, with Fabianski positioned too far to the other side.         
	The tempo increased late on as both teams searched for a winning goal and the Gunners were lucky not to be reduced to 10 men for the last 20 minutes. Midfielder Denilson only got a yellow card for pushing the referee when unhappy with a decision.         
	And Drogba then scored to give Chelsea their first FA Cup win over Arsenal since 1947.         
	In the Premier League, Sunderland and Stoke both boosted their chances of avoiding relegation with 1-0 wins.         
	Stoke beat visiting Blackburn through a 75th-minute goal by Liam Lawrence to move nine points clear of the relegation zone and push Rovers deeper into trouble, while Djibril Cisse scored just before halftime to give Sunderland victory against Hull.         
	While Stoke, in their first top-flight season since 1985, now look to be safe from the drop, Sunderland are still in danger despite moving above Blackburn and Hull into 15th place.         
	The north-eastern club have 35 points, one more than the teams they leapfrogged and four more than 18th-place Middlesbrough. (AP)

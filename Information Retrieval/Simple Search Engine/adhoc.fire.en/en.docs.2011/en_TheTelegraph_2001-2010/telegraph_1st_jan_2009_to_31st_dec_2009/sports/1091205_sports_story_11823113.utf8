	New Delhi: Three-time champions India will start their campaign in the SAFF Cup in Dhaka when they take on Afghanistan on Saturday.         
	With a side made up of under-23 players from the I-League clubs, India are the only side in the eight-nation competition to have come without their first team players.         
	But coach Sukhwinder Singh believes they are capable of regaining the regional supremacy they had surrendered to the Maldives last year.

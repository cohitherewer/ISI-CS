                                                   Indians get down to business
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Indian team began its preparation for the seven-match ODI series against Australia with a light training session here on Tuesday.         
	The squad, sans Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Amit Mishra and Ishant Sharma, went through a two-hour long training session in which a game of football took up most of the time.         
	Sachin Tendulkar had a lengthy batting practice at nets while captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Ravindra Jadeja, Yuvraj Singh and Harbhajan Singh also faced a few deliveries.         
	Coach Gary Kirsten was assisted by mental conditioning expert Paddy Upton and trainer Ramji Srinivasan in guiding the players.         
	The BCCI did not give a reason for the absence of the four Delhi players. Sehwag, Gambhir and Mishra could have been excused as they were part of the Delhi DareDevils team that played a Champions League T20 match on Monday, but Ishants absence couldnt be explained.         
	The quartet was expected to join the team Tuesday night, a team source said.         
	Rookie Sudeep Tyagi of Uttar Pradesh was present at practice.         
	The national selectors had dropped Rahul Dravid, Dinesh Karthik, R.P. Singh and Yusuf Pathan from the Champions Trophy squad for the first two ODIs.         
	The first ODI is to be played in Vadodara on October 25.

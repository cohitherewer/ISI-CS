The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvraj salutes Sachin
                                                   Yuvraj salutes Sachin
                      
	Colombo: Yuvraj Singh said his post-century celebration in the third ODI was actually a tribute to Sachin Tendulkar who taught him how to negate Sri Lankas mystery spinner Ajantha Mendis.         
	Soon after completing his century on Tuesday, Yuvraj was seen pointing his bat towards the dressing room where Tendulkar responded by waving at him.         
	I normally talk to Sachin about my batting he gave me a few plans to play Mendis, Yuvraj said. Last time, I got out to Mendis a few times. This time, Sachin told me a few points which really helped me in getting through those overs and give it back to him, Yuvraj said.         
	It turned out to be a memorable outing for Yuvraj who not only slammed a 95-ball 117 but also claimed a wicket to grab the Man of the Match award on Tuesday.         
	Yuvraj also heaped praise on Virender Sehwag. I share this Man of the Match award with Sehwag. He has been brilliant today and took pressure off my shoulder. In a partnership, normally one guy works off the pace, nudging the ball around. But both of us were devastating today. We put bad balls to boundary, he said.         
	I think its a big achievement to score a century ahead of Sehwag. He generally gets there within a blink, Yuvraj added.         
	Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene admitted his team was not up to the standard of Dhonis Team India and there were some grey areas to be fixed, especially the bowling, which was absolutely off the mark in Tuesdays match.         
	There are certain areas we need to tighten up. Against a good opposition like India, certain things were not up to standard, he said.         
	Well definitely have a chat with the selectors now but we need our best team to win the next two matches, which is very important to get back the confidence. We have a lot of cricket ahead, he said.           (PTI)

                                                     Had to sack Kevin: ECB chairman
            PAUL KELSO            Kevin Pietersen                           
	Kevin Pietersen put English cricket in an impossible situation by calling for Peter Moores to be sacked and left the England and Wales Cricket Board with little choice but to strip him of the England captaincy, chairman Giles Clarke said on Tuesday.         
	Speaking for the first time since the captain and coach were removed from their posts last week, Clarke said that Pietersens ultimatum had effectively forced the dismissal of captain and coach.         
	Clarke refused to criticise a player who will be central to Englands chances of success in the next 12 months, but the implication was clear: failure to move against Pietersen would have endorsed player power with damaging long-term consequences for the management of the England team.         
	Describing the circumstances that led to the effective dismissal of the ECBs two most important employees as horribly problematic, Clarke said the board had no option but to act decisively.         
	The ECB was faced with an impossible situation and it raised issues that had very serious implications for the game, he said. It has been a very difficult time and when the issue arose it was obvious it was going to be horrendously problematic, but a lot of people have behaved with great dignity, not least Pietersen and Moores.         
	The abrupt departure of captain and coach came just a fortnight before the team begin a tour of the West Indies but Clarke insists that the ECBs swift action has given the team the best possible chance of success in a year that features the World Twenty20 Championships in England, an Ashes series and tours to West Indies and South Africa.         
	The matter has been dealt with decisively and our focus is now on the future. Strauss is the captain and will be a fine leader. It is very encouraging to see the players stressing their commitment to pull together under his leadership.

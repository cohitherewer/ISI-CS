            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: World Cup winning coach Dav Whatmore, who is now with the Kolkata Knight Riders, was the chief guest at the prize distribution ceremony of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship, and had a word of advice for the youngsters.         
	Have a dream and chase it, Whatmore said. There are a lot of kids who wont be getting any prizes in this meet... Some of the talented ones may not have had a great tournament But that doesnt stop anyone from pursuing his dream.         
	Whatmore went on to cite the example of former Australian fast bowler Merv Hughes. Merv was never considered for selection to the national side in his youth. But he represented Australia at the Test level and that is the ultimate, said Whatmore.         
	GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly said: I first played here in 1988 and it was my second tournament. I was adjudged the best young player. The Telegraph chess tournament has played a big role in my career.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Injury very frustrating, says Kevin
                                                   Injury very frustrating, says Kevin
                      
	London: It took four injections to make Kevin Pietersen match fit for the second Ashes Test but the maverick England batsman fears the agonising Achilles injury might eventually ruin his summer.         
	In the two Tests so far, Pietersen has not been the free-flowing strokemaker he is known as. He took a second cortisone injection in his spine before the Cardiff Test and two into his right heel. Pietersen said the injury has become a distraction for him.         
	To be honest it plays on my mind all day and every day. People who have had injuries know that it definitely does affect the way they play. It doesnt really affect my strokeplay but running between wickets and diving around is problematic, Pietersen said.         
	This is the first injury I have had and mentally, they really do get to you. Ive had two injections into my back. And Ive had a cortisone and a homeopathic injection into my Achilles, he said.         
	Asked if it meant a possible breakdown, Pietersen said, Were not talking about anything in the future, were just managing it right now. We are treating it on a day-to-day basis just to get me out on to the pitch. Its incredibly frustrating.

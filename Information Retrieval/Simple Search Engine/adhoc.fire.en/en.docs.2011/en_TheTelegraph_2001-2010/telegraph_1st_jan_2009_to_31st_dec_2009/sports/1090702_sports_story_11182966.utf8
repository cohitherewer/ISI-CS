The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting is crap as captain: Thomson
                                                   Ponting is crap as captain: Thomson
                      
	London: Ricky Ponting is crap as captain, never deserved to get the job and has not improved a bit in the five years at the helm, said pace legend Jeff Thomson in a scathing attack on the Australian skipper just days ahead of the Ashes.         
	I thought Ricky was crap when he was first captain in 2004 and nothing much has improved since then, said the 58-year-old, 100 of whose 200 Test wickets have come against Ashes rivals England.         
	Im not the only one who thinks that. Ive always bagged him and everyone at home thinks hes s**** at the captaincy. Hes a great player but captaincy is a totally different thing, he said at a charity dinner here.         
	Thomson said he couldnt believe when Ponting was picked as captain in 2004. I couldnt believe it when hed been picked as captain. There was no one else to pick but Ponting still had no experience.         
	Hed only captained one side ever before. How did he get to lead Australia with that sort of experience? He was in a side that had very good players and now hes got a side that has average players. Hes still left wanting, Thomson said.         
	Thomson said Pontings on-field mannerisms are not of a leader and he is the first to panic when the team is in trouble.         
	You see it on him  he gets frustrated. He worries when the players dont do what hes used to with the ball when he passes it to them, he said. The choices he makes, his field settings and the things he does are never right.         
	After Ponting, Thomson turned his ire on spinner Nathan Hauritz and said even part-timers like Simon Katich and Michael Clarke stand a better chance of grabbing a wicket.         
	 ...He (Ponting) has got a bloke in there who cant even spin a ball (Nathan Hauritz). Simon Katich and Michael Clarke have more chance of taking a wicket than Hauritz.         
	Why go for a guy like that? I dont rate Hauritz, said Thomson.         
	Thomson, however, still picked Australia as the favourite for the Ashes that starts July 8.         
	England have the edge in the captaincy department. But while England have a better captain, Australia have a better line-up.         
	On Australias possible line-up for the five-Test series, Thomson said he didnt see pacer Brett Lee finding a place in the side.         
	I dont see a place for Brett Lee in this side. He hasnt played for such a long time. Mitchell Johnson is a handy bowler but whats really added another string to his bow is his batting  hes a really good batsman. He bats properly and is a good hitter of the ball. Hes got defence and attack. (PTI)

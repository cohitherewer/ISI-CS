The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jenson Button is all set to drive alongside Hamilton
                                                                                                                                     Jenson Button is all set to drive alongside Hamilton
    - Three-year deal likely to be worth 6 million per season                   Jenson Button                           
	London: Formula One world champion Jenson Button has agreed terms on a three-year deal with McLaren and could sign a contract within days, a British newspaper reported on Tuesday.         
	There was no immediate comment from the Woking-based team or the drivers management.         
	The deal would be worth 6 million a year to 29-year-old Button.         
	If the deal goes through, Button would almost double his current salary and partner compatriot Lewis Hamilton in an all-British line-up of champions at the Mercedes-powered team.         
	He won the championship with Brawn this year, with that team becoming Mercedes Grand Prix next season after a takeover was announced on Monday.         
	Button was given a guided tour of the McLaren factory last Friday.         
	Brawn chief executive Nick Fry said on Monday that he hoped a deal could still be done with the driver but made clear that the Mercedes takeover did not mean more money for Button.         
	Weve had discussions with Jenson which we think are a sensible salary and this is not going to change anything in that respect, he said.         
	I hope Jenson will be with us next season, weve worked together for a good few years now and succeeded in winning a world championship together, he added.         
	We want Jenson to be with us but we have to recognise that Formula One is not divorced from the rest of the world. We work within a budget and if we spend the money in one area, we cant spend it in another.         
	Button took a hefty pay cut to stay with Brawn this year and ensure their survival after former owners Honda pulled out in December 2008.         
	He now wants his pay restored to a level more fitting to a world champion, even though salaries are coming down throughout the sport.         
	Mercedes GP is reported to be focused on adding Nico Rosberg to the team but Fry dismissed the notion it would field two German drivers.         
	The implications for Button once, and if, the deal goes through are much more significant than just two world champions coming together; that should be a worry for the other teams. Button, for his part, would have to get ready to race alongside one of the most talented drivers in Formula One and prove his worth in a team that has great motor racing pedigree.

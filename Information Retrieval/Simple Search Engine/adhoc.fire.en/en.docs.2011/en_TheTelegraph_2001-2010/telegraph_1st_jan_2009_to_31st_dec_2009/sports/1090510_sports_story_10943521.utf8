The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Liverpool romp past West Ham
                                                     Liverpool romp past West Ham
                  Steven Gerrard celebrates his goal on Saturday                     
	London: Liverpool stepped up the pressure on Manchester United by returning to the top of the Premier League with a convincing 3-0 win at West Ham on Saturday.         
	Steven Gerrard netted twice before the break and substitute Ryan Babel added a late third to wrap up the points.         
	Before kick-off this looked like a tricky assignment for Rafa Benitezs side, but it appeared a whole lot easier less than two minutes in.         
	It took the Reds just 76 seconds to go ahead, as fit-again Fernando Torres slid a perfect pass through to Gerrard and he rounded Robert Green before stroking the ball into an empty net.         
	The crucial second goal came seven minutes before the break, and it was a needless one for the Hammers to concede.         
	Luis Boa Morte hauled down Torres as he raced into the box and conceded a penalty. Gerrards spot-kick was saved by Green but he followed up to tap home the rebound.         
	Liverpool were in total control after the break, and added a third six minutes from time when Babel scored from close range. The Reds are now top on goal difference but United have two games in hand.         
	Earlier, West Bromwich Albion kept alive their slim hopes of avoiding relegation from the Premier League with a 3-1 win over Wigan. With Hull losing 2-1 against visiting Stoke, the Baggies second win from three games means they still have a chance of climbing out of the relegation zone with two games remaining.         
	On-loan striker Marc-Antoine Fortune scored twice to help lift West Brom to 31 points, the same as Newcastle and Middlesbrough, who meet Monday. Hull are just three points further ahead and is in real danger after its winless streak was stretched to eight Premier League matches.

	Calcutta: All-rounder Ravindra Jadejas unbeaten half-century on ODI debut, in Colombo the other day, has placed the national selectors in somewhat of a quandary.         
	While they wouldnt like to drop him for the five ODIs (and the two Twenty20 matches) in New Zealand, eventually he may have to be the one to make way for veteran offie Harbhajan Singhs return.         
	Harbhajan, who missed the just-ended short tour of Sri Lanka owing to a hamstring injury, is available for selection.         
	The limited overs matches (February 25-March 14) will be followed by a three-Test series (March 18-April 7).         
	Its a tough situation... The selectors surely wouldnt like to be unfair to young and impressive Jadeja, but no other way out looks possible... I understand theyve been losing much sleep, a top source told The Telegraph on Thursday evening.         
	The selectors (chairman Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Yashpal Sharma, Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave and Raja Venkat) meet in Chennai on Friday morning. Theyll be picking two squads, each having 16 players.         
	Theres no word, however, on the injury-prone Munaf Patel, whod returned home after playing only one ODI. So, its assumed that replacement Lakshmipathy Balaji would go to New Zealand as well.         
	As there were 15 players in Sri Lanka, the selectors just have to decide on the second keeper, wholl be the 16th member.         
	Dinesh Karthik is the frontrunner, but Parthiv Patel isnt out of the frame totally. Bengals Wriddhiman Saha, who made such a big impression in the IPLs inaugural edition, last year, is the dark horse.         
	Purely as a keeper, Saha is probably better than both Karthik and Patel, but they score on batting... Today, the keeper has to be a good batsman too. Its a demand of the times, the top source added.         
	If a compromise is reached, then rookie Saha could be selected for one form and Karthik for the other. The more likely scenario is of the second keeper being common to both squads.         
	The last Test squad (home series against England) had also featured 15 players and so the selectors dont need to add anybody besides the second keeper there as well.         
	Some changes, though, may take place.         
	For example, its expected that left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha will make way for an extra seamer  Balaji, in all probability.         
	If Munaf is unavailable, then somebody has to take his place. One learns that Dhawal Kulkarni of Mumbai and Rajasthans Pankaj Singh (who toured Australia in 2007-08) are in contention.         
	Sadly, despite being among the wickets, Ranadeb Bose isnt being talked about in the corridors of influence.         
	One other change could see the exciting and in-form Ajinkya Rahane of Mumbai coming in for Subramaniam Badrinath as a reserve batsman in the middle-order. Rohit Sharmas credentials may also be discussed.         
	Its not clear whether captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and coach Gary Kirsten would favour five seamers in the Test squad. If they do, then both Kulkarni and Singh could be there.         
	In that case, Karthik would have to be picked as the third opener as well, with specialist Murali Vijay having to miss out.         
	LIKELY SQUADS         
	FOR TESTS: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (capt.), Virender Sehwag (vice-capt.), Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman, Yuvraj Singh, Gautam Gambhir, Murali Vijay, Subramaniam Badrinath/Ajinkya Rahane, Dinesh Karthik, Harbhajan Singh, Amit Mishra, Zaheer Khan, Lakshmipathy Balaji, Ishant Sharma, Dhawal Kulkarni/Pankaj Singh. Dark horse: Wriddhiman Saha.         
	FOR ODIs, TWENTY20: Dhoni, Sehwag, Sachin, Yuvraj, Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Karthik, Irfan, Yusuf Pathan, Harbhajan, Pragyan Ojha, Zaheer, Balaji, Ishant, Praveen Kumar. Dark horse: Saha, again.         
	Note: Sachin wont be considered for the two Twenty20 matches.

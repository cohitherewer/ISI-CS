            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nottingham: The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) will soon begin negotiations for a visit by the Indian team in January 2010.         
	Weve sent a proposal to the Board of Control for Cricket in India... It covers a tri-series (with Sri Lanka as the third team) and two Tests, a top BCB official told The Telegraph.         
	The last time that India toured Bangladesh was in June 2008, for a one-day tournament.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB to restrict foreign participation
                                                   CAB to restrict foreign participation
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal is contemplating putting a rule in place for registration of foreign players.         
	While Kalighat officials claimed they had a struck a deal with Sri Lankas mystery spinner Ajantha Mendis, Mohun Bagan have already registered five foreign players for the remaining part of the season.         
	The CAB is thinking about restricting the number of foreigners from next season rather than disallowing the practice.         
	It will be a good learning experience for our youngsters as they rub shoulders with an international player. No matter how old these internationals are, their experience always comes in handy for cricketers at the domestic level, CAB joint secretary Arun Mitra said on Wednesday, justifying the decision.

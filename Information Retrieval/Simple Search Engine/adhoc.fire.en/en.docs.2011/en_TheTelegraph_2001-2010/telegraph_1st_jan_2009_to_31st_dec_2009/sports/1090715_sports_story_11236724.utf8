The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev pulls out of Open
                                                     Jeev pulls out of Open
                  Jeev Milkha Singh                     
	Turnberry (Scotland): Jeev Milkha Singh Tuesday pulled out of the British Open due to a lingering rib injury.         
	When I went out Monday to play 18 holes, it was hurting. When I was taking deep breaths, it was also hurting and when that happens, you know its back, said a dejected Jeev.         
	Im only 60 per cent fit and I dont want to play a Major championship in that condition. My game is good but I just dont want to take any chances this week, Jeev said.         
	I dont want to play in a tournament for the sake of playing but I want to be competing and be in contention. I want to be fit and Ive always believed in that, he added.         
	In his absence, Gaganjeet Bhullar becomes the only Indian in the Major which starts Thursday, having qualified by virtue of his triumph in the Asian leg of the International Qualifying held in Sentosa in April.         
	Meanwhile, Jeev has been replaced by Australian John Senden in the tournament.         
	Jeevs withdrawal was more or less a certainty as the Indian had earlier vowed not to compete in a major tournament if he is not fully fit.         
	The lesson I have learnt is that I am not going to risk further aggravating an injury and will tee up for the Majors only when I am 100 per cent fit, Jeev said.         
	I have promised myself I am not going to tee up, even if the tournament happens to be the Masters. There is no point of playing big tournaments if you are not fully fit, he added.         
	The world No.41 picked up the injury at the European Open seven weeks ago but still decided to play in last months US Open at Bethpage Black, only to miss the cut.         
	Jeev had a word of advice for Bhullar.         
	I told him to play some low shots, stay calm and be patient. When I was playing my first Major, I was really nervous and Im sure hes going to be nervous too. But thats all part of learning and being a better professional, Jeev said.         
	Having spent the last fortnight here, Bhullar has played seven practice rounds at the Ailsa Course and the Kapurthala lad seemed keyed up for his first major experience.         
	Im now the lone Indian in the field and definitely therell be more expectations on me. Its a big shoe to fill but mentally Im ready, said Bhullar.         
	The youngster also seemed to have developed a liking for the course.         
	This is the best golf course you can ever think of. The fairways, greens and tees are all in perfect condition and I know Im going to enjoy this week, said Bhullar.           (PTI)

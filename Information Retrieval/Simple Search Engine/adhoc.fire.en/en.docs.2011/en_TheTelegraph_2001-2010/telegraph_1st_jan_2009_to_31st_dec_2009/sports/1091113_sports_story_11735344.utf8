	Mumbai: Sri Lankas preparations in the Test and ODI series against India was severely affected as the second days play of their lone warm-up match, against the Board Presidents XI, too was cancelled due to wet ground conditions at the MCA ground Thursday.         
	Cyclonic rains, unusual in November in this part of the country, had washed out the first days play and although the sun came out on Thursday, some portions of the ground were still damp enough to deny play. The umpires made an inspection at 1pm before deciding to call off play for the day.

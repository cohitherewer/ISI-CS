                                                   Hosts wary of inspired Sri Lanka
                      
	Lahore: Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene believes his team will not be put off by the occasion of his last match as captain when the second Test against Pakistan starts Sunday. I dont think its a distraction, Jayawardene said Saturday.         
	The focus and emphasis is on winning the Test match...nothing is different. He also said that he has had no second thoughts about making way for a yet-to-be-named successor. I felt it was the right time to step down, Jayawardene said.         
	Pakistan captain Younis Khan is cautious ahead of the match that will decide the series after the drawn first Test. We have to be aware of them because it will be Mahelas last Test, Younis said. He was looking for continued improvement in the new-look team rather than results.         
	I dont have much expectations from my players to win the series because its a young team, Younis said Saturday. My focus is to gel them together.

	 Tendulkar, Ganguly abduction hearing
    New Delhi: The prosecution on Tuesday referred to various e-mails of alleged Huji militants before a Delhi court to drive home the point that the militants were in constant touch with their Pakistan-based handlers to execute the plot to abduct cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly in 2002.         
	Through internet, all the accused were in constant touch with each other and they kept apprising each other of their future course of action, chief public prosecutor Anita Hooda told additional sessions judge Pinki.         
	Reading the texts of e-mails, the prosecutor said the militants wanted to abduct cricketers for securing release of two jailed Huji terrorists.         
	Advancing final arguments in the seven-year-old case, the prosecutor referred to the retrieved texts of the e-mail communications among the alleged six accused, including three Pakistan nationals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yang exposed Tigers flaws
                                                   Yang exposed Tigers flaws
            Mark Reason                      
	It was like Roger Federer without the forehand or Usain Bolt in Wellington boots. Tiger Woods could not putt. The greatest closer-out of tournaments in sport history was playing with a broken wand. The magic had gone.         
	After the Korean Y.E. Yang became the first Asian-born winner of a major by beating Woods by three shots to win the USPGA Championship at Hazletine on Sunday night, everyone else in golf will now look at Woods and think that he can be beaten. It could just be the end of an aura.         
	You have to go back to 1996, sometime in the Pleistocene era, to find the last time that Woods lost a 54-hole lead. He had won 27 times in 28 attempts on the PGA Tour. Woods has been a monster. But on Sunday the monster came out of the cupboard and found himself up against a man, who just was not scared. Yang shot 70, Woods 75.         
	Maybe Woods did not have anything to frighten him with. There were no chip-ins and absolutely no putts of any consequence. His last fist pump was on Saturday. The only fist pump on Sunday came from Yang and, like his golf, it was world class.         
	People have been reluctant to believe this over the years, but Woods is the greatest of all time because of his putting. He has been a genius on the green. In the final round of the PGA Woods took 33 putts. It has been noticeable for a couple of years now that his putting has been ebbing and now we could see the tidemark.         
	Woods said afterwards: I made absolutely nothing. I just have to say I had a terrible day on the greens. And I had it at the wrong time. I either misread the putt or had bad putts. All the other 14 major championships Ive won, Ive putted well for the entire week. And today was a day that didnt happen.         
	Days always happen in Woodss world. He draws back the curtain and days happen. But August 16, 2009 never turned up. He put on his red shirt and did not take off. He remained rooted in his own mortality. Coach Hank Haney could yet become a casualty. Lee Westwood and all the other Britons should look on and take heart. Mr Invincible just became Vinny Vincible.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

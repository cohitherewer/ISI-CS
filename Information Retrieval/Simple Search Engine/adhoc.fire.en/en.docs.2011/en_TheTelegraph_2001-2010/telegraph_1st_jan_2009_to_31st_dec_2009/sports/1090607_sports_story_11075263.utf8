The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anil Kumble debuts with homework
                                                   Anil Kumble debuts with homework
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Nottingham: For the past two decades, Anil Kumble had only been familiar with the Bridgeford Road entrance at Trent Bridge.         
	On Saturday, coming for the first time after retiring from international cricket, the former India captain was at a loss trying to locate the entry point for the media.         
	Kumble, after all, is now part of the Fourth Estate.         
	Is it this one or the next? All along Ive known just one entrance and, so, you cant blame me, Kumble told The Telegraph, as he was guided to the entry point.         
	Asked whether he was excited or a tad nervous, Kumble replied: Im fine... Of course, Im a little excited about starting off as a (TV) commentator. Lets see how the debut goes.         
	Kumble had to pass one of the stands and the recognition was instant, with fans screaming Kumble, Kumble...         
	Despite never having played to the galleries, Kumble stopped for a couple of seconds to acknowledge the affection shown.         
	A short distance away and Kumble got surrounded for autographs. Fans began clicking too.         
	As Kumble approached the elevator, which would take him to the commentary position, one asked about the homework hed done.         
	Grinning, Kumble answered: Ive done some homework, yes... There has been a bit of preparation.         
	No surprise that.

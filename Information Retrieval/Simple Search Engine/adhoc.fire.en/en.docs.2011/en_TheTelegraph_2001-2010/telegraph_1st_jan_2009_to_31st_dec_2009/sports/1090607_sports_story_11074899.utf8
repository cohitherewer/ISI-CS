The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AIFF to turn screws on Bagan
                                                   AIFF to turn screws on Bagan
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) appears to be heading for a protracted battle with Mohun Bagan.         
	The name of the Calcutta club, who have refused to release players for the national camp beginning this month, is likely to figure prominently in the discussion when the AIFF executive committee meets at the Football House next Friday.         
	As per the agenda, the members are expected to take up a case against Mohun Bagan general secretary, Anjan Mitra for offering money to Mohammedan Sporting for winning the concluding I-League match against Churchill Brothers.         
	The members are also likely to take up Mohun Bagans complaint against coach Bob Houghton for interfering into the internal matters of the club.         
	The British coach earned the wrath of Mohun Bagan officials when he rose in support of Bhaichung Bhutias commitment and dedication. Houghtons statement appeared in the official AIFF website further infuriating the Bagan officials.         
	As far as we know, no offer was made to Mohammedan Sporting in black and white, said an AIFF official.         
	At the most the Mohun Bagan secretary can be pulled up under the code of ethics. It is difficult to impose sanctions in this case, he added.

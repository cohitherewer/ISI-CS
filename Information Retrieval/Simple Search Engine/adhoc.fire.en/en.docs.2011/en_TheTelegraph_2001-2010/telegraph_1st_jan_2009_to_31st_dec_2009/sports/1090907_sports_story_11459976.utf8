	Calcutta: Crowd violence in football matches is common and, especially in Calcutta, these incidents occur without any rhyme or reason. Just such an episode of hooliganism was on display Sunday at the Mohun Bagan ground during the clubs last group C match against Mahindra United in the IFA Shield.         
	Drama unfolded in the second half in what was otherwise a dull encounter. The match was into its 75th minute when the Mahindra keeper, Subhasish Roy Chowdhury, was struck above the left eye with a stone that came from the section of the gallery occupied by the Bagan crowd. The missile caused a bleeding cut which enraged the Mumbai clubs management.         
	As a consequence, play was suspended for around eight minutes with the Mahindra team officials stepping onto the pitch to remonstrate with the match officials.         
	At one point, it even seemed that the visitors were refusing to carry on with the game.         
	The behaviour of the crowd was unacceptable, said coach David Booth. This is not called support but hooliganism.         
	Henry Menezes, the Mahindra manager was outraged that something like this had happened. First, we were playing with a disadvantage as the match was on the Bagan home ground. On top of that, such behaviour was totally uncalled for. In fact, it was completely unexpected of the Bagan crowd it is unfair, Menezes said.         
	These are national level players. The spectators should have some respect for them.         
	During the time play was stopped, we didnt ask the players to leave the pitch but we wanted assurance from the match officials that such acts wouldnt be repeated.         
	Match commissioner S.S. Shetty, however, played down the incident. This was not an example of crowd violence, he said. We will let the All India Football Federation know of what happened here.         
	One can only wonder that if such incidents occur at the very beginning, what will unfold as the season progresses.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pak board disbands selection committees
                                                   Pak board disbands selection committees
                      
	Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ejaz Butt has disbanded the national selection panel despite the World Twenty20 triumph earlier this month.         
	The PCB said in a statement Tuesday that the decision to disband the senior and junior selection committees would come into effect immediately, but that former Test wicketkeeper Wasim Bari would continue to work as chairman of interim selection panel.         
	Bari was appointed earlier this month after Abdul Qadir blamed meddling by the PCB officials for his sudden resignation as chief selector during the World Twenty20 in England. Pakistan went on to beat Sri Lanka in the final at Lords on June 21 to collect their first major international trophy since claiming the 1992 World Cup title in the 50-over format.         
	The PCB did not say when the next panel of selectors would be named. The interim selection committee will continue to function until further orders, it said in a statement.         
	Ex-Test cricketers Salim Jaffar and Shoaib Mohammed were the members of the senior selection committee while Mohammed Ilyas headed the junior selection panel.         
	Bari had selected the 15-member squad for three Test matches against Sri Lanka with coach Intikhab Alam, captain Younis Khan and vice-captain Misbah-ul Haq as committees other members.         
	After the tour of Sri Lanka, where Pakistan will also play five one-day Internationals and a Twenty20 match, Pakistans next international assignment is the Champions Trophy in South Africa in September.

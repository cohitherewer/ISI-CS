                                                   Need to play for pride
                      
	We play the Deccan Chargers Saturday. They are a team that started the competition with a bang but lost a bit of momentum later. They have lost most of their last few games and that has a lot to do with Fidel Edwards going away for the West Indies.         
	Fidel had bowled well for them upfront, and they are missing that firepower now. They were at the top of the table but at present are competing for a berth in the first four.         
	Their batting is stronger now with the return of Andrew Symonds who has come in with a bang and displayed good form in the last three games.         
	They have basically been a spin-oriented attack with the likes of Rohit Sharma, Pragyan Ojha and Venugopal Rao doing a good job.         
	They have also got back the widely experienced Chaminda Vaas in the attack but are still missing Edwards.         
	Adam Gilchrist, although he retired fourteen months ago, has been in fine form. I had met him before the series and he said that he hadnt played a single game since then.         
	I am sure this has helped him freshen up and come with a clean head in this tournament.         
	He will continue to be the key batsman at the top for the Chargers and will be a very important wicket for us in Saturdays game.         
	Saturday we play at the Wanderers. The wicket at the Wanderers hasnt spun as much as the other wickets around the country.         
	These are day/night games in Johannesburg where the temperature goes down considerably as winter has set in and that helps in holding the wicket together.         
	Once again, we will be lucky to play at the Bullring, which is probably one of the best grounds in the world and we will need to enjoy the atmosphere. Unfortunately for us we are out of the tournament, but we need to play for pride.         
	We lost the game against the Royal Challengers Bangalore on Tuesday, a game we should have won easily. Such losses can be a bit demoralising but we need to pick ourselves up and look at the good things we have done in that game.         
	Not many teams have lost after scoring above 170 but it required a special effort like Ross Taylors to see the game through.         
	We took a lot of positives from that game  McCullums return to form, Husseys good knock and Murali Kartiks fine spell of bowling.         
	We need to take all these positives into the game Saturday because it becomes tough for the team and the players mindset when they keep losing and this is where we have to show our strength of character.         
	Every game in T20 is a new game and any side can win on that particular day.         
	The Royal Challengers showed us that again by beating the Chennai Super Kings Thursday in Durban and we need to learn from them.         
	We are rotating our players to give everyone a go but I am sure we will pick the best team that will deliver the goods for us at the Bullring.           PROFESSIONAL MANAGEMENT GROUP

                                                   Joining ICL a mistake: Razzaq
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Karachi: Pakistan cricketer Abdul Razzaq reckons joining the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL) was perhaps a mistake.         
	The all-rounder, whose international career was resurrected with the surprise call-up to the T20 World Cup squad, however said he has put that experience behind him.         
	Perhaps it was an error on my part but those two years are behind me now and I want to enjoy my remaining cricketing years playing for Pakistan, Razzaq said Thursday.         
	Razzaq became the second player from the rebel league, after Irelands Niall Brien, to play for his national side in the World T20.

	Calcutta/Agartala: Manoj Tiwarys (96 ..) stellar performance with the bat helped Bengal scrape through by two wickets against Delhi in the quarter final of the Vijay Hazare Trophy at the Maharaja Bir Bikram College Stadium in Agartala on Wednesday.         
	Delhi claimed two late wickets to peg back the East Zone champions during their chase. But Tiwary held on to his nerves and, with four needed off the last over, scored the winning runs sweeping a Dharshan Kanjania full toss for a boundary.         
	The game was truncated to a 47-over-a-side match and Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla won the toss and invited Delhi to bat.         
	Openers Akash Chopra (29) and Manan Sharma (43) began well for Delhi, sharing a 79-run partnership. However, after losing both Chopra and Sharma in quick succession, Delhi failed to accelerate.         
	The early dismissal of the in-form Virat Kohli for seven was also a setback for Delhi. The failure of the Delhi middle order  M. Minhas (16), R. Bhatia (10) and G. Chabra (23)  made things even tougher for them. Puneet Bisht (36) and Pradeep Sangwan (22) batted efficiently down the order to push the score past 200.         
	Bengal spinners Ritam Kundu and Iresh Saxena, proved quite effective in strangling the run rate. The track assisted the spinners and both Iresh and Ritam, made life difficult for the Delhi batsmen. Iresh bowled exceptionally well giving away only 17 runs in ten overs and scalped two wickets. Ritam also took two while Shukla chipped in with one.         
	For Bengal, the openers didnt click as Sreevats Goswami fell as early as the third over. The in-form Wrddhiman Saha fell for 30. Tiwary tailored his innings to perfection to see Bengal through.         
	His 106-ball innings was studded with nine fours. None of the other Bengal batsmen managed to build on the starts. Delhi spinners Chetanya Nanda and Yogesh Nagar operated on a tight line. Nanda took three for 44 while Nagar pocketed two for 39.         
	Bengal will meet Baroda in the semi-final on Friday.

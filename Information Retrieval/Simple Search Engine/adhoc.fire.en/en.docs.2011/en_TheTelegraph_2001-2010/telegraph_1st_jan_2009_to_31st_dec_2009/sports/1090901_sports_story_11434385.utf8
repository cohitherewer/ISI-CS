                                                   Hughes meets Sachin 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Promising Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes had his dream come true when he met Sachin Tendulkar over dinner here on Monday.         
	There was no official confirmation, but sources said the 20-year-old opening batsman kept the Indian legend busy with his questions on batting and the game in general.         
	The New South Wales player hit the headlines with a century in each innings in the second Test against South Africa earlier this year, but his form suddenly deserted him during the Ashes series and was benched after the second Test.         
	In an attempt to sort out his batting woes, Hughes decided to take batting lessons from Neil DCosta, who coaches at a private academy in Nagpur.

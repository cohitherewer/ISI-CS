	London: A 1-0 victory in Dublin put France on the verge of qualification for the 2010 World Cup but the final step towards South Africa could still be a treacherous one in Paris on Wednesday.         
	Injuries have disrupted Frances preparations for the second leg of their play-off against Ireland who will arrive fuelled by a sense of injustice as they fight to keep their World Cup dreams alive after just missing out to world champions Italy.         
	French anxiety will be shared by Portugal when they take a 1-0 advantage to what will be a hostile second leg in Bosnia while Guus Hiddinks Russia could also be in for a raw night in Slovenia when they travel with a 2-1 lead.         
	With Euro 2004 champions Greece drawing 0-0 at home to Ukraine on Saturday all four of the remaining European slots for the South Africa tournament are still up for grabs on what promises to be a nerve-tingling night on Wednesday.         
	France will be without defender Eric Abidal and midfielders Jeremy Toulalan and Abou Diaby for the visit of Ireland.         
	With Arsenal left back Gael Clichy and Bayern Munich playmaker Frank Ribery also absent for France, Ireland will not be daunted as they try to upset a higher-ranked team in a competitive match for the first time since 2001.         
	With wily Italian Giovanni Trapattoni at the helm they will believe they still have a chance of causing a huge upset.         
	It is 50-50. It is only halfway. Anything can happen. I have seen in my time in Italy, in my time here with Ireland, many surprise results, Trapattoni said this week.         
	Start with a little deflection, 1-0 to us. Why not?         
	Irelands players were riled by Uefas decision to seed the playoffs and their frustrations boiled over on Saturday when midfielder Keith Andrews became involved in a heated exchange with French midfielder Lassana Diarra. Andrews said Diarra made disrespectful comments, a charge denied by Diarra on Monday.         
	I didnt say anything. I have absolutely nothing against Irish people, Diarra said. If Andrews asks for trouble, we will meet again on Wednesday.         
	In Khartoum, Algerias players are fully fit and ready for the war with Egypt in neutral Sudan on Wednesday when the two teams chase the final African place in the 2010 World Cup, defender Madjid Bougherra said.         
	After their last match was marred by violence on Saturday in Cairo and with thousands of fans flying in from Algeria and Egypt to see Wednesdays match, a massive security operation has been mounted in Khartoum with 15,000 police on the streets.         
	Egypt coach Hassan Shehata, whose side kept alive their hopes of reaching the finals in South Africa thanks to Emad Moteabs header five minutes into stoppage time on Saturday, said he planned to switch tactics on Wednesday.         
	(In Cairo) we had to win by two goals so we focussed on attacking, Shehata told reporters. For the next match we need a totally different tactic because we will be on an equal footing.         
	Three Algerian players suffered facial cuts when their bus was stoned on their arrival in Cairo last week. (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 114 players to go under IPL hammer
                                                   114 players to go under IPL hammer
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Indian Premier League (IPL) on Thursday released a list of 114 international cricketers for the second player auction of the cash-rich twenty20 tournament set to kick off on April 10.         
	Former England captain Kevin Pietersen, allrounder Andrew Flintoff and Australia vice-captain Michael Clarke will surely be the most sought after cricketers from the list.         
	The list includes 21 Englishmen, 27 Australians, 13 South Africans, 15 Sri Lankans and a bunch of players from the West Indies, Bangladesh, New Zealand and Zimbabwe.         
	It is understood that Pietersen is on the verge of becoming the worlds highest-paid cricketer next week when he is sold at the IPL auction with a reserve price of $1.35million (940,000).         
	Pietersen has been valued at the highest-ever fee by the IPL and will almost certainly smash the record of $1.5million paid last year by Chennai Super Kings for India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	Andrew Flintoff has been valued at $950,000 for the auction.         
	Flintoff and Pietersens advisers would keep in mind that at last years auction, Dhoni had thrived on a bidding war which saw his base price of $400,000 rocket.         
	The base prices for the remaining England players are unlikely to exceed $250,000. The England players will be available for a three-week window in the tournament for the next two years.         
	South African youngster J.P. Duminy, hard-hitting England batsman Owais Shah and Bangladesh captain Mohammed Ashraful are also likely to grab the attention of the franchises at the auction scheduled for February 6 in Goa.         
	The 26-strong Australian contingent up for grabs at the auction includes Brad Haddin, Nathan Hauritz, Stuart Clark, Brad Hogg, Shaun Tait and Jason Krejza apart from Clarke.         
	England stars Steve Harmison, James Anderson, Monty Panesar, Ravi Bopara, Matt Prior, Ian Bell, Paul Collingwood, Shaun Udal, Ryan Sidebottom and Graeme Swann have also signed up to participate in the second edition of the tournament.         
	The Royal Challengers Bangalore, owned by billionaire Vijay Mallya, met Pietersen last year and remain the favourites to sign him while Flintoff has been linked with joining Sachin Tendulkar at the Mumbai Indians.         
	As per the guidelines set by the governing council for the IPL 2009, each franchisee will have a maximum purse of $2 million less any amount spent on signing temporary replacements from last year to select the cricketers best suited for their teams strategies.

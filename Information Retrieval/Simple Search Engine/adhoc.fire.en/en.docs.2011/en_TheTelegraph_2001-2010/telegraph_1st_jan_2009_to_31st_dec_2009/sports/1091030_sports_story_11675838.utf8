The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vettori will find it tough
                                                     Vettori will find it tough
                  Intikhab Alam                     
	Karachi: Daniel Vettori will find it tough to handle the twin responsibilities of coaching and captaining New Zealand when they square off against Pakistan in an ODI series in Abu Dhabi and Dubai from November 3, feels Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam.         
	New Zealand coach Andy Moles resigned last week following reports that some players were not happy with him. New Zealand Cricket said Vettori will take the additional responsibility of coaching the side until a new appointment is made.         
	It is going to be a demanding time for Vettori until they find a proper coach, Intikhab said on Thursday.         
	Alam said captaining a team was already a very demanding job and the coach is supposed to ease off pressure on the captain.         
	I dont know how Vettori is going to handle the situation but he is a smart cricketer but at the same time the position of a international coach is also very important, he said.         
	They are a good one-day side with some fine utility players. We will have to do our best to beat them.         
	The good thing is our players are keen to avenge the Champions Trophy defeat and want to make a point in this series, he added.         
	Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), keen to keep controversies at a distance, Thursday bluntly told its Abu Dhabi bound cricketers to avoid speaking to media without prior permission.         
	The gag order was issued during a team meeting as the players leave the Pakistani shores tonight to play one-day and Twenty20 matches against New Zealand in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.

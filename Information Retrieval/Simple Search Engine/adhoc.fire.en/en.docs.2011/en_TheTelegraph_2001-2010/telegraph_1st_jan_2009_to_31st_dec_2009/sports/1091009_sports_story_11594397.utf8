	Calcutta: Chirag United would look to continue their winning run when they face Mumbai FC in their second match of the I-League at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday.         
	The Subrata Bhattacharya-coached team had won their first match against Mohun Bagan and want to keep up the momentum.         
	Bhattacharya will be making a few changes in his defensive line-up. Chirags Australian recruit Keegan Nash will be making his I-League debut on the morrow. The defender will play alongside Eduardo in the central defence while Safar Sardar and Kingshuk Debnath will be the right-back and left-back respectively. The Brazilian combination of Joshimar and Edmilson are expected to play upfront.         
	The revamped Mumbai FC team, which mostly boasts of new faces, will be a challenge for Chirag. They are an unknown enemy and such enemies are always dangerous. We will be cautious in the first 10-15 minutes and then attack accordingly. We have a good chance to get full points, Bhattacharya said.         
	Mumbai FC will want the likes of Abhishek Yadav, Satyajit Bose, Noel Wilson and Japanese striker Kayne Vincent to deliver the goods.

                                                     AFC setback for coaches
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT    
	New Delhi: Top club coaches, including Karim Bencharifa, Subrata Bhattacharjee and Shabbir Ali, suffered setbacks when the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) refused to issue them Certificate of Competence to continue coaching in the I-League.         
	According to sources, the AFC general secretary, Alex Soosay, in a letter to the All India Football Federation (AIFF), has rejected its plea to grant recognition to eight I-League coaches considering their vast and long experience in the profession.         
	The rejection came after the AIFF wrote to the parent body to exempt these coaches from the AFC rule that did not allow any coach without an AFC A License to train an I-League side.         
	Five of the eight coaches named by the AFC are Indians while the other three are foreigners. The five are  Subrata Bhattacharya (Chirag), Shabbir Ali (Mohammedan Sporting), Sukhwinder Singh (JCT), Bimal Ghosh (Air India ) and Elvis Goes (Vasco).         
	The three foreigners are  Karim Bencharifa (Mohun Bagan), David Booth (Mahindra United) and Zoran Djordjevic (formerly Churchill Brothers).         
	East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick also falls in the same category. However, his name was not included in the list as he was not coaching any I-League club when the AIFF requested the exemption.         
	Sources said the AFC has now tightened the noose around the AIFF and the I-League clubs. The AIFF will now have to take a decision whether to force the clubs to appoint coaches with AFC A Licenses or to continue with the present system, sources added.

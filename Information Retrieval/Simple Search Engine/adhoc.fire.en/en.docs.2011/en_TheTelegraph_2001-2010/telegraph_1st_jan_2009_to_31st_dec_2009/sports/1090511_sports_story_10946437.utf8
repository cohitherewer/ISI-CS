	London: Manchester United striker Carlos Tevez scored in a 2-0 victory over Manchester City on Sunday to show the Premier League leaders what they are likely to miss next season.         
	The Argentine played the entire derby match after being critical of the club over the lack of a permanent contract and complaining about being treated badly in Sundays media. Tevezs two-year loan deal expired at the end of the season.         
	After Tevez scored right on halftime following Cristiano Ronaldos free-kick goal, he raced over to United manager Alex Ferguson, cupping his ears as fans chanted: Fergie, Fergie  sign him up.         
	Hes a Manchester United player, Ferguson said of Tevezs future after the match.         
	(The fans) love triers. When they try, the fans always take to that. Thats the great thing about football  a lad who tries all the time can be forgiven many a thing.         
	Asked directly if Tevez would be saying, Ferguson snapped: Im not getting into that.         
	If Tevez does leave the club, he is likely to leave with a second Premier League winners medal with United needing only four points to retain their title.         
	The Red Devils can win their third straight league title with a game to spare next Saturday by drawing with Arsenal if they beat Wigan on Wednesday.         
	Kia Joorabchian, who holds Tevezs contract, was in the directors box. While Tevez has raised the prospect joining Manchester City and the club has the money to finance his transfer, it would be highly unlikely to offer him similar success, at least initially.         
	He was a thorn in our side today (Sunday), said City manager Mark Hughes, while not commenting on any interest in Tevez.         
	He played exceptionally well and it was an outstanding strike from him.         
	Sundays 151st derby exposed the massive gulf between the sides as City offered little resistance.         
	Tevez terrorized Citys defence from the start, testing goalkeeper Shay Given with a low shot after four minutes.         
	After a sloppy start, United broke through in the 18th minute after Dimitar Berbatov fell under Stephen Irelands slight challenge.         
	Ronaldos resulting free kick from 30 metres took his goal tally for the season to 26 after the ball deflected off Nigel de Jong and dipped beyond Given, who dived after being wrong-footed by the deviation.         
	Only the angle of the post and crossbar denied Tevez in the 31st minute when he unleashed a curling shot from the left after breaking through the defence.         
	He hit the goal frame again in first-half stoppage time after being fed by Berbatov, who had brought down Fletchers long ball.         
	But this time, the ball went into the net.         
	Robinho, the British-record signing from Real Madrid, squandered a glorious chance to haul City back into the game in the 48th.         
	The Brazil forward took one touch to control Elanos pass, but scooped the ball wide of the target. His teammates were similarly hapless whenever they got in sight of goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar.         
	United is very adept on the counterattack, you have to keep enough players back to control their fast breaks, Hughes said.         
	Ronaldo was unhappy to be replaced in the 60th by Wayne Rooney. While Tevez wants to stay at United, speculation persists that Ronaldo will spend the offseason again pushing for a transfer.         
	As he returned to the dugout, Ronaldo angrily swiped at some TV equipment while shaking his head in clear annoyance. He wanted to stay on. Thats the simple reason, Ferguson said.         
	Hes in great form but I have to look at the bigger picture. Hes had an incredible performance on Tuesday at Arsenal. He ran his socks off. We have got to think about how we can get through the game and keep him as fresh as we can.

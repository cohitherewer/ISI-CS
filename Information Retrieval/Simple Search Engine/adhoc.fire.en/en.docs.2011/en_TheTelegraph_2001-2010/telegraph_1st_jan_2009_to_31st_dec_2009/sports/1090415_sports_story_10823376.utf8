                                                   Sachin: Dhoni doing a fantastic job
                                Sachin      
	Noida: Sachin Tendulkar, who played a key role in Mahendra Singh Dhonis elevation to the Test captaincy, is happy that the Jharkhand cricketer has lived up to his expectations.         
	Im extremely happy and delighted the way he has conducted himself, Tendulkar said on Tuesday.         
	He is a balanced guy, is always on his toes all the time. Before he was made the captain, standing in the slips I interacted with him and picked lot of things which clearly indicated that he has a sharp brain his approach was pretty clear and not complicated, Tendulkar said. I think he is doing a fantastic job, he said.         
	Asked if he would love to have another go at the captaincy, Sachin was almost indignant. Now what kind of question is it? he asked. The team is doing so well (under Dhoni) and you should be proud of it.         
	Tendulkar said he was rather happy playing a mentors role to the younger players.         
	To players like Harbhajan Singh or Yuvraj Singh, Im like their elder brother. I share information not just with them but also with other members of the side. Its a terrific atmosphere in the dressing room and its not just a one-way traffic, he said.         
	We learn from each other and if someone has some issues, there is the coach. Generally its a great atmosphere and I enjoy being part of this side, he added.         
	Once Rahul Dravid decided to step down from the captaincy after Indias England tour last year, Tendulkar suggested Dhonis name to the then BCCI president Sharad Pawar.(PTI)

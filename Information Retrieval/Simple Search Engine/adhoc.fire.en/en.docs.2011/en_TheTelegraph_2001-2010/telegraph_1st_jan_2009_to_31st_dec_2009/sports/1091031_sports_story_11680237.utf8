	Sentosa: Indian-born Swede Daniel Chopra (65) grabbed the clubhouse lead while Gaganjeet Bhullar (67) rose to tied seventh before inclement weather cut short the second round of the $5 million Singapore Open golf tournament here Friday.         
	The 35-year-old Chopra sank in six birdies at the Sentosa Golf Clubs Serapong course to take the lead with a total of seven-under 135 on a day when only 61 players managed to complete their round.         
	Overnight leader Ian Poulter of England was tied with Chopra on seven-under after shooting two birdies in three holes of his second round.         
	Bhullars card was studded with five birdies against a lone bogey, giving him a share of the seventh spot.         
	After securing three top-10s on the US PGA Tour this season, where he is a two-time winner, Chopra said he is determined to end his year on a strong note by winning Asias richest national Open.         
	This year, of all my years since going to America, I feel I have under-achieved. This is the best I have felt about my game in a long time, said Chopra.         
	Among other Indians, Shiv Kapur carded a second successive 72 to total two-over 144, while Jyoti Randhawa was one-under after three holes.           (PTI)

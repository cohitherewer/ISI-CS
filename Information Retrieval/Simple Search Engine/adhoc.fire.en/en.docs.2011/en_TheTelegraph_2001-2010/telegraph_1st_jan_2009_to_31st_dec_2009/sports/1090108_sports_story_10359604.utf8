  - Siddle takes three as australia complete face-saving victory         SIMON BRIGGS             Graeme Smith                                 
	Sydney: Australia finally pulled themselves out of their 12-month slump with a breathless, last-ditch victory over South Africa. Just 10 balls of the match remained when Mitchell Johnson shattered Graeme Smiths stumps with a vicious inswinger.         
	It was an unforgettable conclusion to a series that has matched the 2005 Ashes for sheer drama.         
	This was the second year in succession that the Sydney Test had gone down to the wire, and the atmosphere around the SCG was spine-tingling.         
	For much of the final session, storms were rolling around Sydney, and lightning flashes could be seen behind the old green-roofed pavilion.         
	Then Dale Steyn fell lbw, half-an-hour before the close, and all eyes turned to the players race to see whether South Africas captain Graeme Smith would emerge from the dressing-room.         
	Smith has a broken metacarpal in his left hand, as well as a torn tendon in his right elbow, and had not been expected to take any further part in the match.         
	He didnt even bring his own whites to the ground Tuesday, and was forced to borrow one of Jacques Kalliss shirts. But he chose to bat in any case, and his courage drew a standing ovation from the crowd.         
	Smith may have started his international career as a brash loudmouth, but he has matured enormously and the Australian public have grown to respect and admire him.         
	Smith batted solidly, but his injuries were clearly causing him agonising pain. He tried to get off strike the ball before he was dismissed, even though his partner  professional No.11 Makhaya Ntini  is hardly renowned as a watertight batsman.         
	But the run was not there, and Johnson found a lethal delivery when it was most needed. Even without his handicaps, Smith admitted later, he might have struggled to keep this nip-backer out.         
	I called Mitch and Peter Siddle up and asked them which one wanted to bowl, said Ricky Ponting, the Australian captain, about that penultimate over.         
	We decided that Johnson would have a go at landing one on that crack, which is how he got JP Duminy out, and it worked for him.         
	Even so, Smiths bravery will put this match alongside the Lords Test of 1963  when Colin Cowdrey defied Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith with a broken arm  in the annals of the games most heroic rearguards.         
	Starting the day on 62/1, South Africa were determined not to succumb to the same dead rubber syndrome that saw them lose the final Test in England five months ago.         
	Their problem was that they never managed to assemble the one big stand that might have seen them through to the close. Half-centuries from Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers were not enough, as it turned out, to stave off defeat.         
	The death knell seemed to have sounded for South Africa when De Villiers chopped one on to his stumps with 31 overs still remaining. Amazingly, though, Steyn and Ntini managed to frustrate the Australian attack for over an hour.         
	The cracked pitch was still playing plenty of tricks, so that the ball might scuttle through at your feet one moment and leap for your throat the next.         
	Somehow, though, it refused to connect with the stumps.         
	Even when allrounder Andrew McDonald accounted for Steyn, Australia still struggled to apply the coup de grace. Three balls later, Doug Bollinger swung a ball towards the slips, Ntini edged, and Matthew Hayden dropped what could so easily have been the decisive chance.         
	It was a simple catch, as slip catches go, and the fact that Hayden was almost certainly playing his last Test on Australian soil made the embarrassment all the greater.         
	When youre struggling with your batting it can spiral into all facets of your game, said Smith. And when you drop a catch you know that all your other problems will be brought up again.         
	After this series, I am sure Hayden is just looking forward to just being out of the papers for a couple of days. But I would be relieved if he doesnt come to South Africa because I know what he is capable of.         
	This win will provide Australias young team with vital encouragement as they try to put their recent travails behind them.         
	Their record in 2008 stood at 14 Tests, five wins and five defeats, but most of those successes came against lightweight teams  namely the West Indies and New Zealand.

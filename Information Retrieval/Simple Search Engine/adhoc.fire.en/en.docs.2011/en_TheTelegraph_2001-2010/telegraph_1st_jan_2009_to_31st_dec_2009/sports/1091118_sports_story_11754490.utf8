The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Banerjee: It was our day 
                                                                                                                                   Banerjee: It was our day 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Rohan Banerjee got a scolding from his senior and stand-in captain Manoj Tiwary after getting dismissed for 107 against Karnataka, in Mysore, on Tuesday.         
	The captain (Tiwary) was a bit upset as I got out with only three overs left. I really felt like kicking myself for gifting my wicket to a part-time leg-spinner. It was a half-volley and I went for a sweep when all I should have done was to play out time.         
	My team would have been in a better position had my wicket been intact for the morning on the second day. The new ball is due and it would have been much better if I was there to negotiate the second new ball, Banerjee said, when contacted in Mysore.         
	Banerjee, who is just 23 days short of his 21st birthday, feels that Tiwarys presence at the other end had been of enormous help.         
	He (Tiwary) likes to take control of the situation whenever hes batting. He absorbed all the pressure, which allowed me to play my natural game. All the three pacers (R. Vinay Kumar, Sreesanth Aravind and Abhimanyu Mithun) bowled a good line but I guess it was our day, he said about their 172-run-third-wicket partnership.         
	Banerjee feels that those who didnt give him his due for the 176 against Plate Group wooden-spooners Services last season may have got their answer.         
	I have heard since the last season that the century against Services doesnt matter. I just want to clarify that it was my debut match. That century will always be an emotional one for me. I must admit though that todays effort was a better one, he said.         
	He said that his century against Hyderabad in the Col CK Nayudu Trophy gave him the required confidence.

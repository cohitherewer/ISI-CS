The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pakistan are peerless at Lords
                                                   Pakistan are peerless at Lords
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Pakistan put aside the heartbreak of losing to India in the final of the inaugural World T20 by dismissing Sri Lankas challenge with ease in the title round of the second edition at Lords on Sunday.         
	Younis Khans boys gave their country, shunned by international teams due to its volatile condition, something to cheer about, winning the summit clash by eight wickets with eight balls to spare.         
	Buoyed by some fiery fast bowling, Pakistan restricted Lanka to 138 for six on a pitch that offered plenty of bounce and carry. Man of the Match Shahid Afridi (unbeaten 54 off 40 balls) and Kamran Akmal (37 off 28 balls) then ensured that there were no hiccups during the chase.         
	Afridi played an uncharacteristic knock on Sunday and hit two boundaries and two huge sixes. He looked a bit uncomfortable, if only for a brief period, against Lasith Malingas short-pitched deliveries but hung in there to see Pakistan home.         
	The three Ms of Lanka bowling  Malinga, Muttiah Muralidharan and Ajantha Mendis  failed to weave any magic and that put paid to any hopes that the Lankans had of defending the paltry total. The islanders desperately needed early breakthroughs but Akmal and Shahzaib Hasan (19) put on 48 runs for the opening wicket to give Pakistan a dream start.         
	Shoaib Malik remained unbeaten on 24 with Afridi when the winning runs came for Pakistan, with the fans and the players breaking out in joyous celebrations.         
	Lanka got off to a disastrous start after opting to bat after winning the toss and Kumar Sangakkara (52-ball 64) had to come up with a captains knock to rescue his side.         
	Sangakkaras innings was one remarkable for sense and responsibility. He stood tall amid the ruins and helped his team put up something on the board for his bowlers.         
	He added 68 runs with Angelo Mathews (35 off 24 balls) for the unbroken seventh wicket to take Lanka to a respectable total. Sangakkara hit seven boundaries and handled both spinners and pacers with equal ease. The southpaws uncomplicated batting proved that there were no demons in the pitch.         
	Mathews, part of the Kolkata Knight Riders squad in the second edition of the Indian Premier League, gave his captain able support.         
	The all-rounder, who was surprisingly played in only one match by his franchise, hit three boundaries and a six during his knock.         
	Sangakkara and Mathews added 59 in the last five overs and took Mohammed Amir for 17 runs off the last over of their innings.         
	Earlier, Amir sent shock waves through the Lanka batting line-up when he dismissed the in-form Tillekaratne Dilshan (0)  later adjudged Man of the Series  in the first over after bowling a barrage of short-pitched deliveries.         
	Amir started off with a bouncer to Dilshan and kept him on the back foot on the next three deliveries. Dilshan, who likes getting on top of the bowler from the onset, was visibly frustrated and went for a scoop shot over the short fine-legs head. He didnt connect properly and Shahzaib Hasan, who completed a smart catch.         
	Lanka never really recovered from the early blow and kept losing wickets in a hurry. Abdul Razzaq picked up the next three in the form of Jehan Mubarak (0), Sanath Jayasuriya (17 off 10 balls) and Mahela Jayawardene (1). The all-rounder, who made a return to international cricket in this tournament, once again proved his worth with the ball.         
	Razzaq didnt try too many things and concentrated on maintaining a good line and length. Jayasuriya hit Razzaq for a six and a boundary off consecutive deliveries but dragged it on while attempting another big one. But surprisingly, Razzaq was not allowed to complete his full quota of overs.   
	Cash reward  
	 Pakistan rsquo;s President, Asif Ali Zardari, who is the Board rsquo;s patron, has announced a Rs 10 lakh reward each for Younis Khan and Shahid Afridi.  
	 The rest, one learns, will each have to be content with half that amount.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Must-win match for Mohun Bagan
                                                     Must-win match for Mohun Bagan
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Barreto is Mohun Bagans main hope                                 
	Calcutta/New Delhi: Mohun Bagan will have a tough task at hand when they take on leaders Kuwait SC in a must-win group D AFC Cup match in Kuwait City on Tuesday.         
	Bagan will be without skipper Bhaichung Bhutia, who is nursing a hamstring injury and to make matters worse, central defender Peter Odafe will also miss the crucial tie due to a leg injury.         
	Bagan are at the bottom of the group without opening their accounts after playing three matches. They need to win at Kuwait Sports Club Stadium if they want to remain in contention for a pre-quarter final berth.         
	Kuwait SC are the group leaders with seven points from three matches, while Al Karama of Syria and Jordanian side Al Wihdat, who face each other in another group D match on Tuesday, are on six and four respectively.         
	At the press conference in Kuwait on Monday, Mohun Bagan Karim Bencharifa pointed out that it was a very busy season for the players who played too many matches and were involved in quite a bit of travelling.         
	Bencharifa is confident of getting a result and said his side dont deserve a bottom place in group table.         
	If we look back at the three games in the AFC Cup, we dont deserve to be in the position that we are at the moment, said Bencharifa.         
	Mohun Bagan goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee said that the team was a young side and all the players were motivated and will give their best on Tuesday.         
	Kuwait SC are coming into the match after failing to defend the Kuwait Premier League title which they lost to local rivals Al Qadisiya last week.         
	Their French coach Laurent Banide said his side is now focused on beating Mohun Bagan to maintain their position at the top of group D. He also said that his players were a bit upset and said that it was good that the AFC Cup match was just round the corner so it would give his boys an occasion to bounce back.         
	From now on we will concentrate on the AFC Cup. I hope our teams morale will not be affected by the local league debacle, the Frenchman said.         
	Kuwait SC player Garah Al Ataqy said that they would have to put behind the disappointment of losing the national League and would have to do well against Mohun Bagan since the countrys pride was at stake.         
	He also stressed the need to top the group in the AFC Cup since the round of 16 is a one-match affair.         
	Kick-off is at 2200 hrs (IST).

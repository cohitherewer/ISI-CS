The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Asia Cup will be tougher
                                                   Asia Cup will be tougher
            STICK-WORK - Gurbux singh                            
	It is good and heartening that India won the Azlan Shah Cup. Although the competition wasnt of the highest quality, a win is a win and it should give the team confidence for future events  the next one being the Asia Cup.         
	The competition, Im sure, would be stiffer in the Asia Cup because joining the fray will be South Korea, a team that has a reputation of being the nemesis of India and Pakistan, although we did give them a sound thrashing in the last Asia Cup in Chennai.         
	Sandeep Singhs performance in Azlan Shah has been impressive. The India captain has shown marked improvement in his two roles of defender and penalty corner specialist. With a view to next years Commonwealth Games and the World Cup, the overall performance of the side can be considered encouraging.         
	The FIH president, Leandro Negre on his visit to India to survey the preparation for the World Cup to be held next year, has given a clear indication about the world governing bodys stand on the IOA-IHF impasse over the elections to the domestic body.         
	Negre said in Delhi that the FIH wants to deal with an elected and combined IHF in which the mens and the womens federation should come together. The Spaniard specified that the FIH would like to have the World Cup held under the aegis of the elected body and issued a six-month deadline before which the IOA should hold elections.         
	The IOAs failure to comply would see the event being shifted to Malaysia where the infrastructure is such that they can be ready to host the 12-team competition in a matter of months.         
	I do hope that the World Cup stays in India because if it were to be shifted, we would have to go through the qualifications. India at the moment is assured of a berth by virtue of its status as hosts. So the IOA should heed the FIH warning and ensure the elections are held within the time specified.         
	Himself an Olympian, having represented Spain in Mexico 1968, where I also played, Negre has a good understanding of world hockey. Recently he has opined that going back to the old format of qualification for the Olympics and the World Cup would be far more representative than the one currently followed.         
	Thus, he wants the top six teams, in terms of the world rankings, to qualify directly for the big events with the remaining six places to be filled by the continental champions, as per the earlier rules. I too think the old system  the one that Negre advocates  would give a fair chance to all the teams.         
	Jose Brasa has finally secured appointment as technical director of Indian hockey. His contract keeps him here till the Asian Games in 2010 and his first challenge comes in the form of the Asia Cup in Malaysia.         
	The Spaniard would be working with four coaches included among whom is Harendra Singh, the coach of the Azlan Shah-winning side.         
	Brasas expertise should be used, not by the seniors exclusively but for the all-round development of Indian hockey. The team for the Asia Cup is not too different from the one that won the Azlan Shah Cup and I hope it can repeat the success of last month.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengals Wriddhiman Saha, who made the list of probables for the ICC Champions Trophy and the squad for the Emerging Players Tournament, was not over the moon with his selection.         
	On the contrary he was quite realistic about his chances of making it to the final XV for the Champions Trophy.         
	I will give my best Its not going to be easy to make it to the Champions Trophy squad, but I have confidence in myself. I am looking forward to the tournament in Australia. If I play well Saha said.         
	Asked if he was under pressure being the sole representative from Bengal in the list of probables, Saha said: I have never played with pressure. I will do whatever I can to do justice to my chances.

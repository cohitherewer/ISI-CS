The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sehwags injury too was in IPL
                                                   Sehwags injury too was in IPL
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nottingham: Given the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias penchant for being tight-lipped on everything, except earnings from TV deals and sponsorships, one is often left guessing where injuries to players are concerned.         
	And, yes, the bit about not encouraging injured players to board the team flight is now being observed more in the breach.         
	On Friday, coach Gary Kirsten confirmed that vice-captain Virender Sehwags shoulder injury (a grade-I tear) had occurred during the IPL.         
	Then why did Sehwag (and Zaheer Khan) not get replaced?         
	Fortunately, Zaheer has recovered from his shoulder injury, otherwise captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni would have had to pick his campaign-launching XI from XIII only!         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Dhoni isnt pleased with the way the injury-script has unfolded. Actually, he has good reasons to be unhappy.

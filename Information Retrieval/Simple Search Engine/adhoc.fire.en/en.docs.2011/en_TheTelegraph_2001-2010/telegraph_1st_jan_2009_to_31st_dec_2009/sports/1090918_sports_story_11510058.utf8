	Karachi: Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam Thursday exuded confidence that his team has the potential and depth to win the ICC Champions Trophy which begins on September 22.         
	Intikhab said Pakistan has the firepower and can repeat their World Twenty20 success in South Africa.         
	The Champions Trophy is a tournament in which we have not done well. We have never won it. I think with the depth we have in our side, if we play to our potential we can win the event, Intikhab told reporters at the Karachi airport before leaving for South Africa.         
	The former Test captain said a very balanced side had been selected for the tournament keeping in mind the conditions in South Africa.         
	The batting has experience, youth and firepower. But I think our bowling remains our strongest point. We have quality pace bowlers and in Shahid Afridi and Saeed Ajmal we have two world class spinners, he said.         
	The 67-year-old Intikhab said the team needed to show the same form and resolve they had shown in the World T20 in England. (PTI)

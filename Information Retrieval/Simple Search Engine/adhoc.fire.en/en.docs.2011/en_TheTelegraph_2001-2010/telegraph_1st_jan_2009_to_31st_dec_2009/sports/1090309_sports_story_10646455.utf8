                                                   Windies struggle on Day III
                      
	Port of Spain: Debutant pace bowler Amjad Khan captured the vital wicket of Ramnaresh Sarwan (14) as West Indies reached 176 for three in their first innings at lunch on Sunday.               
	At midnight, the West Indies were 248 for four. Brendan Nash (22) and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (11) were at the crease. Chris Gayle retired hurt on 100.               
	West Indies, chasing Englands 546 for six, need a further 171 runs to avoid the follow-on with captain Chris Gayle unbeaten on 87.         
	Sarwan, who had made three centuries in this series and whose previous lowest score was 94, came in after nightwatchman Daren Powell went early for a duck lobbing a simple catch to Kevin Pietersen off a short delivery from Stuart Broad.         
	Sarwan, who made 291 in the last Test in Barbados, was fortunate to survive when he edged Monty Panesar to Paul Collingwood, who spilled a straightforward catch at the slips.         
	But in the next over, Khan rapped Sarwan on the pads straight in front of the stumps and Gayle indicated to his teammate that a referral would be wasted on such a clear decision.

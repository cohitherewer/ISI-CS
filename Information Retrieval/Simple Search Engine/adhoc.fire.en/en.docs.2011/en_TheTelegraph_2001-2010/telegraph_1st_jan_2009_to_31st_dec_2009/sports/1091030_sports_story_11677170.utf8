            A STAFF REPORTER            Action during the Mohammedan Sporting vs George Telegraph match on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting defeated George Telegraph 1-0 in a Calcutta Football League Premier Division match at their club ground on Thursday.         
	It was Theodore Sunday, who scored the all-important goal at the stroke of half-time. It was Sundays first goal in the CFL this season.         
	Brazilian Eduardos flick for Sunday surprised two of the rival defenders and the Liberian striker threw off his markers by pushing the ball forward. Then, with George goalkeeper Sibram Dey rushing out, Sunday nudged the bouncing ball into the net with his head.         
	Although Sibram did try to scramble back the damage had been done.         
	The scoreline could have been different for the black and white brigade had Eduardo not missed quite a few sitters. In fact, substitute Sashti Duley too had a chance to score but missed the header.         
	The George midfield did try to orchestrate a fightback but Shabbir Alis side managed to hang on.         
	George, indeed, put up a good fight in what was a fast-paced match. Their defence held up commendably except for a few lapses. Georges Nigerian striker, Abiola, was denied by Naseem Akhtar on a few occasions.         
	Weve managed to defeat two good sides till now, Shabbir said. The midfield needs more work but it was a good match.         
	Sunday simply said he wanted to score more. I want to score more goals. Last year I was the highest scorer in the league and I want a repeat this year, he said.         
	In another CFL match at the Kharda Stadium, Peerless SC beat West Bengal Police SC 2-1.

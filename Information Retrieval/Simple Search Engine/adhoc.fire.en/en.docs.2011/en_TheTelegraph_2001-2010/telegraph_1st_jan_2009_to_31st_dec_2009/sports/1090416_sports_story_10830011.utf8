The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Narang pulls off a rare feat
                                                     Narang pulls off a rare feat
                  Gagan Narang                
	New Delhi: Gagan Narang on Wednesday became the first Indian ever to win two medals in a single ISSF World Cup when he claimed gold in the mens 50-metre rifle 3 position in Chongwon, South Korea.         
	Narang, who earlier won the bronze in his pet 10-metre air rifle event, shot 1166 in the qualification round and 98 in the finals to aggregate 1264 points.         
	The Hyderabad shooter, who reached the finals of all three events he participated in here, is also the first Indian to climb the podium in the 50-metre range, according to the National Rifle Association of India.         
	 He had narrowly missed a medal in the free rifle prone event.         
	Among other Indians in the fray, Sanjeev Rajput finished sixth with 1258.7 (1160+98.7) while Sushil Ghalay failed to make it to the finals, ending 11th with qualification round scores of 1155.         
	The silver and bronze medals went to Jinseop Han of Korea for his effort of 1261.9 (1165+96.9) and Alexei Kamenski of Russia for garnering 1261.7 (1167+94.7) points, respectively.         
	Earlier, on Friday Gagan won the bronze medal in the mens 10 metre air rifle.         
	Narang fired an aggregate of 696.7 which included a score of 594/600 in the qualification. He entered the finals as the eighth and last shooter but made up the difference by shooting scores of 102.7 to finish on the podium.         
	Both gold and silver medals were clinched by China with Zho Qinan and Cao Yifei scoring 700.3 (597+103.3) and 698.6 (595+103.6) respectively.         
	Another Indian in the fray, Sanjeev Rajput also reached the finals at fifth place with a score of 595 but was relegated to seventh place with a poor final round of 100.4.         
	His compatriot P.T. Raghunath failed to qualify for the finals after shooting only 591.         
	As many as 38 Indian rifle and pistol shooters are competing in the April 9-15 event.         
	They will then travel to Beijing for the second leg of the 2009 World Cup series from April 17-23.         
	Narang had said he was happy to have started the 2009 season with a medal after doing well last year.         
	I am happy I ended the 2008 World Cup season on the podium with the two world records and now started the new season of 2009 with a podium finish again.         
	This year will be more about experimenting for me so that I can get ready for next year as it is a golden year for shooting, he had said.           (PTI)

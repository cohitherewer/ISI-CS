            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                      
	Ahmedabad: Ajantha Mendis is hoping to make amends for his not-so-impressive performances with the Kolkata Knight Riders during the first two editions of the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	The Sri Lankan spinner is optimistic that the Dav Whatmore-Sourav Ganguly combination will work wonders for the team.         
	Im hoping we do well this time. I havent worked with Dav and dont know his ways But am aware that he has worked wonders with our national side. Im excited and looking forward to working with both Dav and Sourav, Mendis told The Telegraph on Friday.         
	Mendis, who didnt find a berth in the team in the drawn first Test, says he is under no pressure despite facing stiff competition from Rangana Herath. Theres no pressure or competition. Hes left-arm orthodox, and our styles are different, said Mendis.         
	Mendis says he is not affected by the ups and downs in life. Ive never taken it seriously when the media has praised or admonished me I always like to concentrate on my game, the spinner said.

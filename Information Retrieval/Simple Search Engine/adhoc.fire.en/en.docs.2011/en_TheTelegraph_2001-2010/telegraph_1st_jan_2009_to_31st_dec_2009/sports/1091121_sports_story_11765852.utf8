	David Beckham has jumped to the defence of Thierry Henry, following the France strikers controversial handball in the World Cup playoff against the Republic of Ireland.         
	Henry has been condemned as a cheat following his part in William Gallas decisive goal in Wednesday nights playoff second-leg match at the Stade de France in Paris.         
	But Beckham said the incident was not deliberate and said deceitful play was not in Henrys nature.         
	I honestly didnt think Thierry meant it, said Beckham.         
	I know him as a player and a person. Hes a good person and a great player.         
	Its a shame to see Ireland go out because they have such great fans, but these things happen in football.         
	I really dont think he (Henry) meant it. Ive had a few headlines in the past which have not been nice but I dont think he is a cheat.         
	Asked whether he would have done the same thing in a similar situation, Beckham said: Who knows in that situation?         
	Youre playing in a qualifier to go through to the World Cup, you dont know what youre doing.         
	Ive been involved in big games and reacted to certain things and looked back and thought I was wrong to do that.

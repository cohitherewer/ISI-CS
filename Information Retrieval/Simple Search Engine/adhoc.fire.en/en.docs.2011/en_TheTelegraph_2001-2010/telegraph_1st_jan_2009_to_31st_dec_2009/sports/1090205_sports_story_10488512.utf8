The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A test of bench strength
                                                     A test of bench strength
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Mahendra Singh Dhoni                           
	Calcutta/Colombo: India will try out some of their reserve players when they take on Sri Lanka in an inconsequential fourth one-dayer Thursday. Having already clinched the five-match series, Mahendra Singh Dhonis men will be seeking to notch a record-breaking ninth consecutive win.         
	The visitors, no doubt, would ideally like to make a clean sweep of the series, but giving an opportunity to the bench players will also be equally important in the remaining two matches.         
	India humiliated Sri Lanka by 147 runs to win the third match at the R. Premadasa Stadium Tuesday.         
	Everything has gone well for Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men in the series, and the team will be keen to keep the winning sequence going for the record ninth consecutive victory.         
	The Indian batting has been far superior to the home teams, and the bowling has also been quite disciplined to bring about the desired results.         
	Dhonis men can grab the No. 2 spot in the ICC ODI Championship table provided they complete a 5-0 whitewash in Sri Lanka and Australias misery continues against New Zealand.         
	India are already within two ratings points of Australia and four behind leaders South Africa (125).         
	With Dhonis men touring New Zealand in March where they will play five one-dayers, a lot can change before the April 1 cut-off date.         
	The top side in the ODI Championship will be richer by $175,000 with the runners-up getting $75,000, the ICC said in a statement.         
	Dhoni had made it clear after Tuesdays match that giving reserve players a chance to prove themselves was more important than retaining the winning team. We are not looking at the record. Rather, we will give chance to players who didnt get a chance to play in the series so far, Dhoni said.         
	The pitches in the two games so far at the Premadasa have been totally different. While the first one stayed more or less the same through the match, the one used for the second game was a batting paradise in the first half but offered the spinners alarming turn and bounce during the Lankan chase.         
	For the Indians, there are really no major worries and it remains to be seen who among the seniors are rested for Thursdays match to be played under lights at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground.         
	Sachin Tendulkar has fallen victim to dubious umpiring decisions three times in a row and would be keen to make his presence felt with a substantial contribution.         
	Yuvraj Singh and Virender Sehwag, the two centurions in the last game, could be rested along with pace spearhead Zaheer Khan who has taken a lot of bowling load in recent times.         
	Sri Lanka, however, have only pride to play for in the remaining matches which are merely of academic interest now.         
	The home side, who have been playing non-stop cricket for the past five months now, will be under pressure to regroup and rediscover their winning form.         
	Captain Mahela Jayawardene would have to ensure that his team execute the game plan well to win the next two matches and reclaim their confidence ahead of a busy season.         
	The home sides main area of concern would be their bowling given how Fervez Mahroof and Dilhara Fernando performed in the third match, returning figures of 7-0-68-0 and 8-0-63-1, respectively.         
	The other bowlers  Nuwan Kulasekara 10-0-68-0, Ajantha Mendis 9-0-64-1 and Muttiah Muralidharan (10-0-60-1)  werent any better.         
	I am disappointed with the bowling, Jayawardene said after the match.         
	Besides, his main weapons, Muralidharan and Mendis, will also need to urgently find a way to stop the rampaging Indians.

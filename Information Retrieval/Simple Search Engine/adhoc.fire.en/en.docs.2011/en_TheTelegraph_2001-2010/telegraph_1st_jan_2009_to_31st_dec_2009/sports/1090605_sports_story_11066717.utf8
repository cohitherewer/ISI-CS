The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Viru fitness a worry; Zaheer seems fine 
                                                     Viru fitness a worry; Zaheer seems fine 
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Virender Sehwag                           
	Nottingham: The shoulder factor is at play  Team India vice-captain Virender Sehwags right and senior-most quick Zaheer Khans left.         
	While Zaheer bowled for a while in London on Wednesday, before the warm-up match against Pakistan, and felt no pain, theres a question mark over Sehwag playing in our World T20 opener against Bangladesh, at Trent Bridge, on Saturday.         
	Well have to take a call over the next couple of days... Theres nothing else to say at this moment, coach Gary Kirsten told The Telegraph shortly after the Mahendra Singh Dhonis arrived at the Park Plaza around 5.30pm.         
	Sehwag, as usual travelling with his wife and son, looked somewhat tense. Zaheer, on the other hand, seemed at ease and could make the XI against a team which must not be underrated in any form of limited-overs cricket.         
	Remember the Queens Park Oval and the 2007 World Cup?         
	Its not clear when exactly Sehwag got injured, but Zaheer hurt himself rather early in the Mumbai Indians campaign in edition No.2 of the IPL.         
	Look, its a tough situation... We cant take Bangladesh lightly, but there will be more important matches, in the Super Eight stage... We arent sure whether Sehwag, assuming hes declared fit, should be risked on Saturday, said a member of the team management who didnt wish to be identified.         
	Sehwag and Zaheer werent available, but that didnt impact on the match against Pakistan, which attracted a sell-out crowd at The Oval, with thousands turned away from its gates.         
	Winning any match makes you feel good... It sure lifts morale, remarked Dhoni, as he was (typically quietly) collecting the key to his room.         
	Meanwhile, Bangladesh captain Mohammed Ashraful, who had a sore shoulder, batted at nets on Thursday, clearing any doubts over his availability.         
	Footnote: Senior pro Yuvraj Singh didnt come on the team bus, but was to reach Nottingham late in the evening. He got the team managements permission to spend a few more hours in London, for work apparently related to charity.

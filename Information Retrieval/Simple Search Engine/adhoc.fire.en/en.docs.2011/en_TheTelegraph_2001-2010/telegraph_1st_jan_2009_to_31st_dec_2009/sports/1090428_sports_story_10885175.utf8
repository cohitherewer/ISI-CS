                                                     Another dark night for Knight Riders

	Another dismal show saw the Kolkata Knight Riders go down by an embarrassing 92 runs to the Mumbai Indians on Monday. This was the Shah Rukh Khan-owned franchises third loss in five matches.         
	The tournament, for sure, is a long one with each team due to play 14 matches, but the Knight Riders are making it increasingly difficult for themselves to clinch a last-four berth.         
	Everything went wrong from the word go for John Buchanans boys at the St Georges Park in Port Elizabeth on Monday. It started with the toss of coin when Sachin Tendulkar called correctly and decided to bat first.         
	The Knight Riders included an extra batsman in the side, Ajit Agarkar making way for Arindam Ghosh. It, however, did not pay off as Anureet Singh got injured as early as the very first over and the Knight Riders were rendered a bowler short. The medium-pacer twisted his ankle and was also unable to bat.         
	Buchanans boys had hoped for an early wicket but they found themselves on the receiving end of an assault by the Mumbai Indians openers Sachin Tendulkar and Sanath Jayasuriya. The duo put on 127 runs for the first wicket in almost no time, eventually powering the team to a daunting 187 for six in their 20 overs.         
	Set a steep target of 188 to win, the Knight Riders never really got off to a rollicking start with the early loss of openers Brendon McCullum (1) and Chris Gayle (12). The duo, Knight Riders best bet and the best suited in the team for the shortest version of the game, were back in the hut by the third over.         
	McCullum failed to keep down a snorter from Sri Lankan Lasith Malinga and was caught by JP Duminy at point. Gayle got out just when he started looking dangerous. After surviving a caught and bowled chance off countryman Dwayne Bravo of the earlier ball, the West Indies captain failed to keep down a rising delivery on the off stump and edged it to Tendulkar at slip.         
	Sourav Ganguly was the highest scorer for the Knight Riders with a 30-ball 34, but in the end it was too little too late. Looking to clear the ground, he managed to sky Abhishek Nayar into the hands of Dwayne Bravo.                     
	The late-order completely capitulated before the fiery pace of Malinga (three for 11) and the gentle medium pace of Nayar (three for 13) and the Knight Riders were shot out for a paltry 95 in 15.2 overs. Malingas three-wicket haul also fetched him the purple cap  presented to the leading wicket-taker.         
	Deciding to bat first, the Mumbai Indians set the Knight Riders a daunting target, courtesy blistering half-centuries from their openers.         
	When Tendulkar (68 off 45 balls) and Jayasuriya (52 off 32 balls) decide to complement each other shot for shot, one can well imagine the plight of the bowlers.         
	The Mumbai Indians reached 61 for no loss at the end of the six-over power play  their best start so far  and were at 111 for no loss at the end of 10 overs.         
	The strategy break, at the end of 10 overs, worked wonders for the Knight Riders.         
	The introduction of Laxmi Ratan Shukla, immediately after the strategy break, pegged back the blistering run-rate. Shukla picked up three wickets, including Tendulkar and Jayasuriya.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Big time chess returns to city
                                                   Big time chess returns to city
            BIPIN SHENOY                                Surya Sekhar    
	Calcutta: Chess buffs in the city are in for a delight with the resumption of big time chess  the Kolkata Open  from Tuesday. Apart from 35 Grandmasters, two Super Grandmasters, with an Elo rating of over 2700, will be seen in action at Gorky Sadan in what promises to be the strongest open in Asia.         
	Shakriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan, with a rating of 2721, and the only player to have won the world junior title twice, is the top seed.         
	Also in the fray is former world title contender Nigel Short (2706) of England, on his second visit to the city, having earlier played in the Goodricke Open. With his recent triumph in the Staunton Memorial, Short should be a strong contender for the top spot.         
	Chinese GM, Ni Hua (2692), is the third seed in the tournament, sponsored by Peerless. He had finished third during an earlier visit in 2004.         
	Asian mens champion and consecutive six-time national champion Surya Sekhar Ganguly (2634) leads the Indian challenge. Parimarjan Negi, Sandipan Chanda, GN Gopal, Neelotpal Das, Abhijeet Gupta, Arun Prasad, Magesh Chandran, Deepan Chakravarthy, Abhijit Kunte and Tejas Bakre are the other Indian GMs in the fray.         
	Kunte has the unique distinction of being the only Indian to win an Open in Calcutta.         
	Calcuttans, though, will surely miss Indias second GM Dibyendu Barua, who in his prime made headlines by beating the then world No. 2 Victor Korchnoi.         
	Barua, who had won the Bangladesh International GM tournament a couple of days back, was surprisingly, not invited by the organisers.         
	Incidentally, Barua had tied for the second place with Short and others, when the British GM played for the first time here in 1998.         
	When contacted by The Telegraph on Monday evening, Barua said: Ive just received an invitation from the secretary requesting me to play. Chess is a mental game and it is not possible to participate if you ask me to play from the next day. A tournament of this stature requires proper preparation.         
	Surya Sekhar Ganguly, too, was surprised at Baruas virtual exclusion. Though he is not playing much, his win in Bangladesh reflects his current form. He will surely be missed, Surya said.         
	Mamedyarov is clearly the favourite in my opinion. He is very talented and creative in his approach. Apart from Mamedyarov, the field, in general is very strong and would be good preparation for my World Cup games, Surya added.         
	When asked about Bengal youngsters who might impress, he said: Bitan Banerjee is playing confidently and well these days. He has got two IM norms recently. I am sure he will achieve his third and final norm soon.

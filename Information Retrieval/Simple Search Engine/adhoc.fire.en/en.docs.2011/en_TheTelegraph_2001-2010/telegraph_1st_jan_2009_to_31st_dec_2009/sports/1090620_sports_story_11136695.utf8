The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Intikhab: We can and will win has been our motto
                                                     Intikhab: We can and will win has been our motto
    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  The Pakistan coach is oozing confidence             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Intikhab Alam                                 
	London: Former captain Intikhab Alam was the coach when Imran Khans men lifted the 1992 World Cup. Almost two decades later, Pakistan is in yet another final  the World T20  and Intikhab is again in the coachs chair.         
	Despite being pressed for time, Intikhab spoke to The Telegraph (over the phone) from Nottingham on Friday morning.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Emotions at this point in time         
	(Laughs) Im not a very emotional person, but Im delighted... Weve just had a very good win (over South Africa) and now its a question of one match.         
	Whether memories of 1992 have been revived         
	How can I forget those weeks and moments... I think weve had a similar pattern in this World T20... The team has peaked at the right time, something crucial in the knockout stages.         
	Fear that the players could get carried away         
	No... No... Theyre focused... For us, just one step remains and we wont give it away.         
	Whether losing to India in the 2007 final could actually be at the back of the players minds         
	Why should it be? Cricket isnt played by looking back, one looks ahead... Woh final hum bhool gaye hain...         
	Message to his players         
	That were the best and that we can and will win... That, indeed, has been our motto.         
	Pakistans USP in the tournament         
	It has been a team effort... Peaking at the right time and performing as a team are the keys to success and weve achieved both... Having said that, some players have stood out  the captain (Younis Khan), Umar Gul, Shahid (Afridi), Saeed Ajmal... Just about everybody has contributed.         
	Teenaged quick Mohammed Amir bowling the semi-finals last over         
	Hes unbelievably talented and proved that our faith in him wasnt misplaced... How many 17-year-olds can keep nerve in the last over of a World Cup? Come to think of it, Amir wasnt even born when we won in 1992!         
	Whether the Gul controversy affected the team         
	We didnt even take notice (of New Zealands allegation).         
	Youniss captaincy         
	Hes been very good... Younis is committed, wishes to lead from from the front and is so disciplined... A captain needs to be involved and that involvement isnt lacking.         
	Afridi becoming a trump card         
	Ive always said Shahid, despite being around for so many years, hasnt realised his potential... Im glad he has done so in this tournament. Today, hes more confident and, as important, more relaxed.         
	Former captain Shoaib Maliks attitude         
	No complaints at all.         
	The team hed prefer to face in Sundays final         
	Doesnt matter... Anybody.         
	Lastly, what will winning the World T20 mean for Pakistan as a nation         
	Given whats happening at home, I dont think the country can look forward to a better gift... Clearly, winning this tournament wont be like winning any other... Special rahe ga.

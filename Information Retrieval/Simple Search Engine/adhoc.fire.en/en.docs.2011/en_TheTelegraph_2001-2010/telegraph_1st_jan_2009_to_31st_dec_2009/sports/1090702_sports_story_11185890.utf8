The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mike Hussey helps Aussies recover
                                                   Mike Hussey helps Aussies recover
                      
	Worcester: Mike Hussey scored his first century in nine months on Wednesday and helped Australia recover to 337 for eight against England Lions on the first day of the tourists final warm-up match before next weeks Ashes series.         
	Hussey was unbeaten at stumps on 143, while number eight batsman and fellow left-hander Mitchell Johnson was out in the final hour for 47 after combining in a vital seventh-wicket partnership of 109 after Australias batting was rocked.         
	Australia crashed from 165 for two to 197 for six as they lost four wickets for 32 runs. Hussey, who has faced 221 balls and hit 18 fours, rescued his side with his first century in any form of cricket since making a Test hundred in October.         
	Prior to the collapse, Hussey steered Australia out of trouble when they slumped to 24 for two, adding 141 for the third wicket with opener Simon Katich, who made 95.         
	Husseys unspectacular but steady innings was largely trouble-free though he was dropped by Sajid Mahmood off his own bowling when on 75. Pace bowlers Steve Harmison (three for 67) and Tim Bresnan (three for 46), seeking to impress the national selectors, shared six wickets as Australia got off to a difficult start on a slow pitch.         
	Opener Phillip Hughes, who had been struck on the bicep from a rising Harmison delivery, was dismissed for seven when he gloved another Harmison short ball to gully.         
	Ricky Ponting edged Graham Onions to first slip for one, trying to force the ball through the covers off the back foot. Katich and Hussey dominated before and after lunch. But Katichs failure to execute a short ball from Harmison outside his leg stump led to his dismissal.         
	Brief scores: Australia 337/8 (M. Hussey 143 ..; S. Harmison 3/67) vs England Lions. Match to continue.           (AP)

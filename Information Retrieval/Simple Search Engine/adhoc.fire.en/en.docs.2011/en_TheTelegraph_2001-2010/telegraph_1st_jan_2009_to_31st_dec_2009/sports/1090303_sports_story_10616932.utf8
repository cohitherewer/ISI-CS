The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United wary of dropping points 
                                                   United wary of dropping points 
                      
	London: Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson is treating Wednesdays Premier League match at Newcastle with as much importance as the League Cup final.         
	United won the second of the five trophies available to them this season by beating Tottenham on penalties in Sundays final, but Ferguson knows that his players could drop points at St James Park if they allow the triumph to distract them, letting Chelsea or even Liverpool back into the title race.         
	United are seven points clear in their attempt for a third consecutive Premier League title, but that advantage could be eroded by the time they play because Chelsea are at Portsmouth and Liverpool host Sunderland on Tuesday.         
	Tottenham, meanwhile, have other concerns as they chase points to get away from the relegation zone. Spurs host Middlesbrough on Wednesday and then play at Sunderland in Saturdays only Premier League match.         
	Liverpool must beat Sunderland in one of Tuesdays three matches to be considered even an outside contender for the title. A run of just two wins in seven matches including Saturdays poor 2-0 loss at         
	Middlesbrough have dropped Liverpool down to third. We lost a great opportunity to try to get closer to Manchester United, Liverpool defender Fabio Aurelio said.         
	We will still keep on fighting because we know in football that anything can happen.         
	Chelsea moved ahead of Liverpool on goal difference on Saturday and now appear to be Uniteds most likely rival for the title.         
	The Blues go to Portsmouth on a four-game winning streak.         
	Arsenal are at last-placed West Bromwich Albion in Tuesdays other match.           (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Feels good to be back, says Irfan
                                                                                                                                   Feels good to be back, says Irfan
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Baroda needed him in their hour of crisis and Irfan Pathan made sure he put his hand up and was counted.         
	He may not have exactly set the stage on fire but made significant contributions with bat and ball (43 amp; 3/90 in 26 overs) to ensure Baroda are in a commanding position against Bengal.         
	It really feels good to be back in action after a nearly four-month break. Its all the more satisfying as I have been able to contribute for my team. It was a difficult wicket to bowl on as it is a bit on the slower side.         
	I believe all three of us (Murtuza Vahora and Firdous Bhaja being the other two) bowled as per plan, Irfan said after the end of days play.         
	The younger of the Pathan siblings had been out of action due to a shoulder injury.         
	Irfan admitted he was yet to reach peak fitness.         
	I need to run a bit more to get fully fit. Actually I joined the team after eight days of training whereas it would have been good to get at least 14-16 days of practice. I rushed my comeback as I wasnt feeling any pain.         
	He termed Sourav Gangulys dismissal the turning point. Dada was playing as if he was still active in international cricket. When we got him, we knew we were in with a chance as Laxmi played risky shots.         
	However things threatened to turn ugly with Irfan getting involved in a spat with curator Prabir Mukherjee when the pacer invited a scribe from the electronic media on to the field. Mukherjee rudely asked the reporter to leave and that led to an altercation.         
	He had no business talking to a person like this. If you cant behave properly, you shouldnt expect good behaviour, the all-rounder said.

	Guwahati/Lahli: Ajinkya Rahane (116 ..) and Ajit Agarkar (78) saved Mumbai the blushes with a 174-run partnership as the visitors reached a respectable 238 for five on the opening day of their Ranji Trophy quarter-final against Haryana here Thursday.         
	Opting to bat, Mumbai made a disastrous start, losing two early wickets that reduced them to 55 for four.         
	While Haryana pace duo Joginder Sharama and Sanjay Budhwar struck once each, Sachin Ranas two wickets in two balls pushed Mumbai on the backfoot.         
	However, Rahane and Agarkar combined well to steady the rocking ship with their fifth wicket stand.         
	And Rana was at it again breaking the partnership in the last session of the day trapping Agarkar.         
	Rahane who came out to bat as early as in the fourth over, at the fall of opener Sahil Kukreja, was rock solid and batted through the day to rescue his side.         
	His patient knock came off 267 balls with the help of 14 shots to the fence.         
	After Agarkars wicket Romesh Powar (unbeaten zero) saw off the proceedings of the day with Rahane and will resume the innings Friday.         
	Powar faced 29 balls in his 45 minute stay in the crease and is yet to open his account. But the visitors would be happy that the plump spinner ensured there was no further damage to their innings.         
	Failure of young gun Rohit Sharma (0) was a big disappointment for the reigning champions.         
	In New Delhi, Tamil Nadus top order fired in unison with three of the first four batsmen hitting half-centuries to propel the side to 278 for four wickets after the opening day against Delhi.         
	In Mysore, Uday Kaul (68) and Vishwas Bhalla (61 ..) hit half-centuries as Punjab survived two batting collapse to reach a healthy 292 for nine on Day I against Karnataka.         
	Meanwhile, in Guwahati, Assam managed to restrict former champions Uttar Pradesh to 213 all out in 81.2 overs in the first innings but suffered a major setback when key batsman Dheeraj Jadhav sustained an ankle sprain while fielding on Day I at the NF Railway Stadium. Assam were 17 for one in eight overs at close.         
	UP openers Tanmay Srivastava (26) and Shivakant Shukla (47) started the day sharing a 67-run partnership till Konwar claimed Srivastava off his very first delivery of the match in the 19th over.         
	Shukla also shared a 29-run stand for the second wicket with skipper Mohammed Kaif (56). Spinners Arlen Konwar and Sairaj Bahutule shared eight wickets among themselves.

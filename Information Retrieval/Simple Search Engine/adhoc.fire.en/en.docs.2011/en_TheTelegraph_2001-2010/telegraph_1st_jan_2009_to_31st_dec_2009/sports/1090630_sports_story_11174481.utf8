                                                   Waited for the rash shots, reveals Rampaul
                      
	Kingston: West Indian pacer Ravi Rampaul, who wrecked Indias batting with a career-best four-wicket haul to script his teams thumping win in the second one-day International on Sunday, said that the rash shots played by the visiting batsmen helped his performance.         
	I was getting little swing with the ball so I was just waiting for them to play the rash shots, he said.         
	Delighted with figures of four for 37 that helped the West Indies restrict India to a paltry 188 and eventually win the match by eight wickets, Rampaul said he hasnt bowled so well in a long time.         
	It was the best I have bowled for a long time. I was playing four-day cricket and coming back to the one-day format, my rhythm and everything went well I bowled really well today (Sunday), he said.         
	Analysing his performance, Rampaul said he took full advantage of the Indians susceptibility to short-pitched bowling.         
	They werent too comfortable with the short balls so I used it as a surprise delivery, Rampaul said.         
	The 24-year-old, who dismissed Gautam Gambhir and Rohit Sharma for ducks in his first over, said he is an attacking bowler and also quite a miser when it comes to conceding runs.

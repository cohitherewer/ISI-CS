	Cuttack: The zonal limited overs tournament for the Deodhar Trophy is slated to begin on Friday with the five zonal teams  North, Central, East, West and South  and the Zimbabwe Presidents XI facing each other on a round-robin basis in two venues, the Barabati Stadium and the Ravenshaw University Ground respectively.         
	On paper, West Zone appear to be the heavyweights, boasting the top three run getters  Wasim Jaffer, Ajinkya Rahane (both Mumbai) and Cheteshwar Pujara (Saurashtra)  of the Ranji Trophy Super League this season.         
	Led by former India opener Jaffer, West Zone, the eight-time winners and the reigning Duleep Trophy champions, will open their campaign against South at Barabati on Friday.         
	West Zone are in Group B along with South and Zimbabwe Presidents XI.         
	In absence of experienced campaigners Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Dinesh Karthik, Laxmipathy Balaji and Sreesanth, South appear a depleted side and have to rely heavily again on captain Subramaniam Badrinath who has been the Tamil Nadu batting mainstay for quite a long time.         
	Defending champions Central Zone will also take the field on Friday against North. (PTI)

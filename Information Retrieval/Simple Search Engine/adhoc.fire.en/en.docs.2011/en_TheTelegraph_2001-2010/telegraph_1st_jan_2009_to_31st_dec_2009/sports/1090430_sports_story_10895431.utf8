The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI offers amnesty to rebels 
                                                   BCCI offers amnesty to rebels 
            OUR BUREAU                                
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Wednesday paved the way for the return of Indian Cricket League (ICL) players to official competition by offering amnesty to them, provided they severed ties with the rebel league before the end of next month.         
	The BCCI, whose working committee met in Mumbai, said that the individuals  i.e. players, support staff, umpires and administrative officials  who terminate their contracts with the ICL and formally communicate their willingness to return to its fold would be allowed to participate in the domestic tournaments straightaway but could compete at the international level only after a years cooling period.         
	Many players and support staff had approached us and said they wanted to come back into the BCCI fold. They have admitted they made a mistake and we have decided to give them a chance, BCCI president Shashank Manohar said at a news conference.         
	As per the ICC guidelines, any cricketer or official who participates in an unauthorised event has to undergo a cooling period of one year before he could play at the international level, Manohar added.         
	The BCCI decision falls short of a complete revocation of the ban imposed on the ICL players. In fact, Manohar said that those who return to the BCCI would not be compensated for the loss of their monthly pension that was withdrawn when they joined the ICL. They will have to face some punishment and will not get the unpaid amount, the BCCI president said.         
	The ICL and BCCI have been at loggerheads ever since the league was announced two years ago, in the aftermath of Indias disastrous 2007 World Cup campaign.         
	But with the wheels of the Zee-promoted league, with Kapil Dev as the chairman of its executive board, beginning to come apart, the amnesty would more or less clear the way for the rebels to resume official duty.         
	Manohar was quick to point out that Wednesdays decision comes after the ICC had last month rejected an application by the ICL to recognise it as authorised unofficial cricket.         
	The ICL introduced the franchise-based model and organised T20 and 50-over championships for two seasons but struggled to find sponsors. If the BCCIs muscle and money power proved a massive stumbling block at the domestic and international levels, the overwhelming success of the Indian Premier League effectively put an end to the ICL aspirations.         
	The ICL responded to the development with a curious statement from its business head, Himanshu Mody.         
	Taking forward its sports performance evaluation process across all cricket operations, the ICL management has decided not to renew the contracts, of some of the ICL players and support staff, that have expired. As cricket professionals they are free to decide and explore their options, Mody said in the statement.         
	Sources, however, claimed that the decision to throw a lifeline to the participants in the rebel league was influenced by the BCCIs ever-growing worry about broadcasting rights.         
	BCCI generates most of its revenue from selling broadcasting rights, an ICL official said. We have reasons to believe that the BCCI officials are worried that the revenue might reduce in the near future. So now they want to patch up with Zee.         
	The ICL official said that it would be difficult for television channels to raise the amount they have committed to the BCCI for various tournaments. The BCCI perhaps wants more players to join the fray for broadcasting rights, the official said.

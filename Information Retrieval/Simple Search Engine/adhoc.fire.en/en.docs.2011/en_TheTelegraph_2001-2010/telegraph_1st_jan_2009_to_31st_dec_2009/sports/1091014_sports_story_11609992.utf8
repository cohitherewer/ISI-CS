The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Oram retires from Tests
                                                     Oram retires from Tests
                  Oram                     
	Wellington: New Zealand all-rounder Jacob Oram, who has been battling constant injury breakdowns, Tuesday retired from Test cricket to prolong his career in the shorter formats of the game.         
	Announcing his decision, effective immediately, Oram said a reduced workload would allow him to prolong his international career.         
	I have decided to retire from Test cricket. This decision has been a very tough one and has not been made without careful consideration and discussion with those closest to me, 31-year-old Oram, who is currently nursing a hamstring injury that cut short his Champions Trophy, told reporters here.         
	The last few years have shown that my body cannot handle the strains and stresses that come with being an all-rounder, playing all three formats for up to 10 months a year.         
	Oram said New Zealand do not play as many Tests as one-dayers and T20s, which is why he had chosen to continue in the shorter versions.         
	For the sake of longevity Ive had to make a decision that will decrease my workload, he said.         
	Oram has played 33 Tests, scoring 1780 runs at an average of 36.32. His record includes five centuries and six half-centuries.         
	With the ball, Oram has taken 60 Test wickets at an average of 33.05.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Patil is the new NCA director
                                                   Patil is the new NCA director
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: World Cup winner Sandeep Patil on Wednesday said he was nervous about taking up the job of heading the National Cricket Academy (NCA), which he hoped would make up somewhat for missing out on being coach of the Indian team.         
	I have got butterflies in my stomach. I feel like as if I am about to play my first Test, Patil told The Telegraph after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) appointed him as Director-Cricket Operation at the Bangalore-based academy.         
	Patil steps in for Dav Whatmore, who resigned earlier this week to take up as coach of IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	Its going to be challenging. Guys like Dav (Whatmore) before me have done a great job. Dav, of course, is a close friend of mine  so I am excited as well as tense, said the 54-year-old Patil, who represented India in 29 Tests and 45 ODIs and was a member of the 1983 World Cup-winning squad.         
	Patil was coach of the Indian team in 1996 and also the Kenya team that reached the 2003 World Cup semifinals. Besides, he also worked with the Oman national team.

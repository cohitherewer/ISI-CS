The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | It will be tough: De Ridder
                                                                                                                       7                                      It will be tough: De Ridder
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Guwahati: East Bengal coach Phillipe de Ridder said Thursdays semi-final clash against Mohun Bagan at the Nehru Stadium, here, would be a tough one.         
	They are the team in form. Have been playing really well. We will have to raise our game to leave the pitch with beaming faces, the Belgian said on Wednesday.         
	De Ridder, however, categorically said that the clash on the morrow was not about revenge. No way. Its just a match and we will play to win. As simple as that, he said.         
	The red and gold brigade coach was upset with the poor standard of refereeing in the country and said that is hampering the growth of the game.         
	So many footballers are getting injured and referees are just not bothered. There are tackles from behind, career-threatening tackles and they are failing to pick those up. If things continue like this, god save Indian football, said an upset De Ridder.         
	Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencherifa, on the other hand, said his side were focussed on the match but they would miss the crowd support that they enjoy in Calcutta.         
	It is a new day and a new game and there will be pressure on everyone in every game. But, we will definitely miss the 40,000-odd fans of the Salt Lake Stadium here the Moroccan remarked, when asked whether there was any pressure on his side.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Somdev warns rivals
                                                   Somdev warns rivals
                      
	Chennai: Indias new tennis sensation Somdev Dev Varman, after pulling off a major upset by defeating former French Open champion Carlos Moya on Thursday, said his opponents have to play really well to beat him here.         
	The 23-year old, playing for the first time before his home crowd since turning pro last year, defeated sixth-seed Moya 4-6, 7-5, 6-4.         
	Im a counter-puncher. Like Floyd Mayweather, you keep taking, you keep taking. But, Im not going to fall down. You really have to earn your points to beat me. Thats the kind of tennis I want to play.         
	Im not going to go away. I want to be mentally strong, no matter what people throw at me, Im not the one to quit. Thats the player I want to be, Somdev said after the match.         
	The two-time US collegiate champion said he was far from being content after beating Moya and will treat his quarter-final against big serving Ivo Carlovic as just another match.         
	Hopefully, Im not ending just in the quarter-finals here. I dont want to be a guy who is just satisfied with the job. But I dont want get too cocky or confident either.         
	Its just another match. I think Im going to play Karlovic. I just have to find a way to beat him. Nothing else, nothing more fancy. I will treat it as just another match.         
	Talking about the turning point in the match, he said, I was down 0-40 in the second game of third set. I think I came up with the goods there. I forced him into a few errors. I think I gave five break points, and another one. When I held there, I felt like I sent a message to him, that I wasnt going to go away. That he has to earn the match.         
	Somdev admitted that initially he had butterflies in his stomach finding Moya as an opponent across the court but said he stuck to his own kind of tennis to beat his fancied rival.         
	I fought back hard. I did the right things to come back. That was me being a little bit intimidated by the fact that it was Carlos Moya at the other end.         
	After a few baseline points I started believing more and more that I can actually win this match, playing my kind of tennis. I didnt have to do anything extraordinary. Thats when I started believing that I can actually win the match, he said.         
	Moya said Indias rising star Somdev is armed with a strong game and predicted that he will soon break into the top 100.         
	He does not play typical Indian tennis. He has a serve and volley game and is bestowed with a great serve as well. He has the potential to be in the top 100 in the near future, Moya told reporters after his shock defeat.         
	He plays better than his ranking shows but one has to assess his growth in the Tour this season, Moya said.         
	Leander Paes said Somdevs win did not surprise him. I have been saying for a while that Som is going to carry on Indian tennis to greater heights. He has been playing well. I was not surprised that he won today against Moya but the manner in which he progressed and strategically was on road to victory was excellent, Paes said.         
	Mahesh Bhupathi said: Five months since he turned pro, we all in the locker room expected him to do well. His transition has been excellent. I think he has a fighting chance even tomorrow against Karlovic, he said.

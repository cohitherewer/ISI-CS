                                                     Last-over win for India

	Colombo: World champions India rode a late blitzkrieg by Pathan brothers, Yusuf and Irfan, to snatch a thrilling three-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in the one-off Twenty20 International here Tuesday night.         
	Chasing a stiff target of 172, Irfan (33 not out) and Yusuf (22 not out) scored 59 runs from 25 balls in the tense final moments to steer India home in a pulsating floodlit contest at the Premadasa Stadium here.         
	Suresh Raina (35) and Yuvraj Singh (32) were the other notable performers for the visitors as India capped their brief tour of Sri Lanka with a stunning victory in the Twenty20 game in addition to their 4-1 ODI series triumph.         
	Earlier, captain Tillekeratne Dilshan led from the front, smashing his maiden half-century to guide Sri Lanka to 171 for four after he won the toss. Veteran opener Sanath Jayasuriya contributed a quickfire 17-ball 33 in the first Twenty20 match between the two sides.         
	Disaster struck India just as they began the run chase with both the openers returning to the pavilion at 14 for two after facing just seven balls.         
	In-form Gautam Gambhir (13) showed his aggression clobbering Lasith Malinga for three fours in the first over before disaster struck in the form of Virender Sehwags wicket.         
	Sehwag (1) was beaten by a Chamara Kapugedera direct throw after Gambhir had played a Malinga delivery on the off-side in the last ball of the first over.         
	Gambhir fell for 13 in the first ball of the second over while trying to pull Thushara over mid-wicket only to find the top edge snapped by Kaushalya Weeraratne at mid-on.         
	One-down Raina and Yuvraj played sensibly, curbing extravagant shots but hitting odd balls to the boundary, and at the same time keeping the asking rate well under manageable level.         
	The left-handed duo revived the Indian innings by sharing an 87-run stand for the third wicket in seven overs before the former was out for 32 off Jehan Mubarak in the ninth over.         
	Dilshans smart change of bowling paid off, with Yuvraj inducing a thick edge to Dilshan while trying to play a cut off the back foot. Yuvraj hit three fours and two sixes in his 21-ball innings.         
	With the required run-rate down to less than eight, Indian batsmen should have saved the wickets but Raina paid the prize for playing an ambitious shot.         
	After hitting a six off Malinga Bandara, Raina attempted a similar shot but this time only managed to hole out to Indika de Saram. He hit five fours and a six in his 27-ball innings.         
	India lost four wickets for the addition of 34 runs with Dhoni (13), Rohit Sharma (4) and debutant Ravindra Jadeja (5) falling in quick succession. India were virtually out of the match by the 15th over but Yusuf and Irfan never gave up. From 115 for seven, the two brothers took India to victory with four balls remaining.         
	Irfan hit the winning runs, a six off Lasith Malinga, to take the visitors to 174 for seven and spark wild celebrations in the Indian camp. Yusuf faced 10 balls and hit one four and two stunning sixes in his knock while Irfan played 16 balls and struck two fours and as many sixes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pakistan level series
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pakistan level series
                      
	Wellington: Pacer Mohammed Asif and leg-spinner Danish Kaneria led Pakistan to a comfortable 141 runs victory in the second Test against New Zealand here Sunday. The visitors thus level the three-match series at 1-1.         
	Resuming at their overnight score of 70 for three, the Black Caps were bowled out for 263 in their second innings. Ross Taylor was the top scorer for the hosts with 97 while captain Daniel Vettori chipped in with 40. But their efforts were not enough as the Asif-Kaneria duo wrecked havoc on a lively pitch.         
	According to cricinfo, Asif finished with five for 67 while Kaneria grabbed three for 74. Mohammed Aamer took the other two wickets.         
	Asif, adjudged the Man of the Match, finished with match figures of nine for 107.         
	Taylors breathtaking counter left Pakistan dazed and confused and briefly raised hopes of an audacious steal. He had started a dull morning like a man on speed. Quick hands and feet helped him drive easily through covers but an ugly slog across the line for six off Asif unleashed something even more in him.         
	He took care to mix in some more dapper strokeplay as well, a whippy cut through point and a couple of fine sweeps off Kaneria that easily carried for six.

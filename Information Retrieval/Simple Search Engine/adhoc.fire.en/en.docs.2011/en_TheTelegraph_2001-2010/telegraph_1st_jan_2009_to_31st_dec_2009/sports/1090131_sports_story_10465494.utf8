The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India looking to land Colombo blow
                                                     India looking to land Colombo blow
                  Ishant Sharma                     
	Colombo: On a roll having notched a sixth consecutive ODI triumph, a confident India will seek to maintain their winning streak when they take on Sri Lanka in the second cricket one-dayer here Saturday.         
	Even without explosive opener Virender Sehwag, who was nursing a lower back injury, the Indians were hardly pushed as they beat the Lankans by six wickets in the opening match on a tricky Dambulla pitch.         
	The much-touted Murali-Mendis combine failed to work for the Lankans, forcing skipper Mahela Jayawardene to admit that the duos magic was somewhat on the wane.         
	However, the Indians would do well to remember the humiliation they were subjected to when the two teams squared off the last time around at the R. Premadasa stadium.         
	Chasing a modest 227, the Indians were sent packing for 103 in under 27 overs with Mendis wrecking the visiting line-up with a four-wicket haul.         
	For the hosts, ageing war-horse Sanath Jayasuriya continues to deliver, but opener Tillekeratne Dilshans lean patch and middle-order mainstay Kumar Sangakkaras inconsistent run with the bat have become major concerns.         
	Jayawardene, himself battling a batting slump, however, insists that one loss is not reason enough to press the panic button and his teammates would come back hard.         
	The way we have been playing of late has changed and we will continue with that. I give credit to our guys because it was not an easy wicket but it probably slowed down later and so was good to score runs on, he said.         
	The other major difference between the two teams in Dambulla was the runs extracted from the Power-plays. While the Indians milked 40, the Sri Lankans could muster only 28 and that too for the loss of two wickets.         
	The Sri Lankan top-order has not performed to expectation and opening partnerships have not been consistent.         
	Muttiah Muralidharan and Ajantha Mendis were a shadow of their intimidating selves when they bamboozled batsmen. At Dambulla, they conceded almost hundred runs between them for a solitary scalp.         
	The lack of a good fast bowling option also ails Sri Lankan bowling which banks heavily on Murali and Mendis to provide the breakthroughs.         
	The Indians, however, have no such worries. Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma have become an intimidating pace combine, not just picking up wickets consistently but also keeping a check on the oppositions scoring rate.         
	With both batting and bowling working well for the Indians, Dhonis men only have to guard against complacency.

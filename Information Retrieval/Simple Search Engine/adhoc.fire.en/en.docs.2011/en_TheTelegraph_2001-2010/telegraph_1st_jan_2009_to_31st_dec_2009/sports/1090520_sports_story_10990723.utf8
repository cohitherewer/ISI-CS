The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Symmo has Ricky support
                                                   Symmo has Ricky support
                      
	Melbourne: Australia captain Ricky Ponting voiced his support for controversial all-rounder Andrew Symonds return to the Test side for the Ashes series.         
	Symonds has battled controversies both on and off the field but was allowed to play for the country in the ODI series against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi and Dubai recently.         
	Ponting felt it would be a tough job for the selectors to keep out the 33-year-old all-rounder when they meet on Wednesday to pick the 16-member squad for the Ashes.         
	I wouldnt be surprised. He has had his share of battles over the last 12 months, said Ponting.         
	Hes worked his way back into domestic cricket pretty well and played well for us over in Abu Dhabi. Hes a great guy to have around a team, there is no doubt about that, said Ponting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Must forget Wigan loss, says Carlo
                                                   Must forget Wigan loss, says Carlo
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Carlo Ancelotti has promised Chelsea will provide a response in the Champions League this week after suffering their first defeat under the Italian against Wigan.         
	He said: I think that there will be a lot of competition until the end of the season. I dont know why we lost at Wigan because we prepared very well and we knew what was important.         
	This can happen after a lot of victories and we have to accept this loss and fix it in the next match in the Champions League. I dont think we were over-confident. In football it can happen that one day its not good and now we have to look forward.         
	The concern for Ancelotti is that Ashley Cole and John Obi Mikel could both miss the Champions League match after sustaining injuries.         
	Cole picked up a knee injury that forced him to be carried off while midfielder Mikel suffered an ankle problem.         
	Ancelotti is also facing up to the fact that Henrique Hilario will have to fill in for Petr Cech against Liverpool next Sunday; the Czech goalkeeper was sent off on Saturday.         
	Wigan manager Roberto Martinez felt his side have illustrated to other teams how to play against Chelsea.         
	He said: The only way that you can upset Chelsea a little bit is to not allow them the ball, not allow them to feel themselves and they found it difficult in that respect but the moment you switch off youre going to be punished.         
	All the positive things we did were backed up by the concentration levels at the back and it was a complete performance. When you are a team like Wigan and youve got Chelsea at home, youve got two options.         
	You can be brave and beat them or you can get hammered.         
	In the the last two games (against Manchester United and Arsenal) we lost 5-0 and 4-0 and the only reason that we won against Chelsea was that we maintained our standards, we learned our lessons and we were brave from the first second.

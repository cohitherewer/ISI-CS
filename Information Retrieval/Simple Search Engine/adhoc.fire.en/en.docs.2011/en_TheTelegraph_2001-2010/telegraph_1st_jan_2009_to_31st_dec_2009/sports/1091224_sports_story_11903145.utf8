            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: City police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti on Wednesday categorically stated that the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) have not followed all the directives from the police authorities.         
	We had given them specific instructions. During inspection, we found out that all the directives were not followed. This makes the situation difficult for us. Under the current circumstances, we had to strengthen the security system, Chakrabarti said while leaving the stadium premises.         
	However, he didnt want to divulge the details about which are the specific directives that CAB didnt follow. CAB has constructed a temporary wall on both sides of the Club House after the cops expressed reservations about the absence of walls.         
	CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya on his part admitted that there is room for improvement.         
	I wouldnt like to comment on what the commissioner said. All I can say is that we had to arrange the match on time. The match is happening tomorrow (Thursday) and everybody is happy that we will get to see an international match, Dalmiya told newspersons.         
	There is nothing on our part to hide. I believe we are on the right track regarding the organisation, he said.         
	Chakrabarti informed that a three-tier security system will be followed on Thursday. The security process will be same for the exit and entrance of the team hotel as well as the stadium.         
	Any person entering the stadium would have to go through the security check thrice. Once at the channeliser, then at the gate entrance and the final check at the stadium gate.         
	There will also be video cameras stationed at various corners of the ground, which will enable us to have a minute view of the activities in the gallery, he added.         
	For the first time, there will be policemen with automatic weapons at every stand.         
	The team bus will also have commandos in it keeping in mind the Lahore attack earlier this year.

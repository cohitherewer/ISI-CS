The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Im going to rethink my career: Adriano
                                                   Im going to rethink my career: Adriano
                      
	Rio de Janeiro: Brazil and Inter Milan striker Adriano said on Thursday he was taking a break from football and would rethink his career.         
	Ive lost the happiness of playing, the 27-year-old said. I wouldnt like to go back to Italy, I want to live in peace here in Brazil. I dont know if Im going to stay for one, two or three months without playing. Im going to rethink my career.         
	He denied he was suffering from depression, added that happiness was more important than money, and said he had been living with the pressures of being a professional footballer since he was a teenager.         
	Adriano failed to return to Italy after last weeks World Cup qualifiers against Ecuador and Peru, in which he was an unused substitute.         
	On Monday, his agent Gilmar Rinaldi said Adriano had stayed in Brazil because of a private matter and confirmed the player had spent time in Vila Cruzeiro, a Rio de Janeiro favela notorious for violence, where he was raised.         
	Since then, Brazilian media had been full of speculation over what had happened to him.         
	Theres no way Im going to stop visiting my community, said Adriano. Thats where Im at ease, barefoot and in Bermudas.         
	A lot of things have been said in the newspapers but everything Ive done has been thought through. Im not ill. Adrianos not dead, he said, smiling.         
	The striker, who has 29 goals in 47 appearances for Brazil, made his mark at international level when he was top scorer at the 2004 Copa America and the following years Confederations Cup.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                                Lajong FC players warm up before a practice session at the Nehru Stadium, in Guwahati, on Tuesday. Picture: Eastern Projections      
	Guwahati: Lajong FC coach Stanley Rozario on Tuesday said pressure will be on Churchill Brothers when they meet in the first semi-final of the 31st Hero Honda Federation Cup at the Nehru Stadium, here on Wednesday.         
	We have so far done well in the tournament and if our boys can keep it up and even do better tomorrow (Wednesday), who knows, there can be an upset, said Stanley after a brief practice session at the Nehru Stadium.         
	It is an achievement in itself to have reached the semi-finals. We are not as big as Churchill or Dempo but still we managed to make the cut.         
	While saying this I should also add that we are not at all complacent.         
	Just being in the semi-final means nothing. We are now dreaming of winning the title. Our boys have the potential and can do wonders, he added.         
	Rozario heaped praise on this striking duo of S Tuboi and Anil Gurung.         
	They have been fantastic so far. On their day they can run through any defence, he said.         
	The affable coach said he was aware of the Churchill threat.         
	They are a good side. And very experienced. But it wont be easy for them.         
	Churchill Brothers coach Carlos Perreira said that it would not be easy to get past Lajong.         
	They are no pushovers, mind you. If they can make it to the last-four stage, ahead of teams like Dempo and Air India, they have to be good, he said.         
	My team is playing well but Lajong are also the best among the new teams playing in the I League. It is going to be a tough match. There cannot be any chance of taking them lightly, Carlos said.         
	So, whats Carloss trump card saying ahead of the Wednesday clash?         
	Our rivals are a very compact side. They are young and very fast. We will have to cautious, said super sniper Okolie Odafe.         
	Carlos agreed that crowd support will give Lajong an advantage.         
	Its sort of a home match for them. The crowd will be definitely behind them and that gives Lajong a headstart. But we are used to playing in adverse conditions.         
	Football is not only about playing in suitable and friendly domains. We have beaten teams like East Bengal and Mohun Bagan in their own den and I dont understand why we cant get past Lajong, the Churchill coach said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | EB, Sporting in 1-1 draw
                                                   EB, Sporting in 1-1 draw
                                  
	Margao: Sporting Clube de Goas title aspirations received a jolt on Sunday as they were held to a 1-1 draw by East Bengal in the 19th round of the ONGC-I-League match at Nehru Stadium here.         
	The hosts went on the offensive early on with their strikers and midfield combining together to push the opponents into their own half with a series of moves. So pronounced was Sportings attack that it could have easily settled the issue in the first half itself but for the commendable effort from East Bengal goalkeeper Abhra Mondal, who made at least half a dozen saves. Luck also did not favour Sporting as a rasping shot from Nathniel Amos hit the crossbar. The visitors succeeded in finding the net in the 41st minute through substitute Ismael Addo, who replaced Suley Musah midway through the first half.         
	Sporting, however, continued to dictate terms in the second half putting East Bengals defence under tremendous pressure but once again it was keeper Mondal, who came to the visitors rescue by preventing Joseph Pereira and Amos from finding the equaliser.         
	Sportings persistent efforts finally bore fruit in the 64th minute when Joseph Pereira found the net from close range after a one-to-one move between him and Man of the Match Elijah Junior.

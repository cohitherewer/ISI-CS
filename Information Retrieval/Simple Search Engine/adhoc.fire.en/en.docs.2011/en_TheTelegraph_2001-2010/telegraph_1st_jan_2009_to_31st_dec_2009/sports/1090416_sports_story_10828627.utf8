                                                   Bhaichung: Focus is on todays tie
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Mohun Bagan striker Bhaichung Bhutia said that winning against Mahindra United should be his teams first priority on Thursday.         
	The national skipper, who joined the squad on Wednesday, said: One can talk about several permutations and combinations. But at the moment, we are only focused on the Mahindra match. Beating them should be our first job. We will think about the Churchill Brothers vs Mohammedan Sporting match only after we win our game.         
	Bhaichung, however, was hopeful that Churchill would falter at the last hurdle to pave the way for Bagan. Anything can happen in football. We have seen dramatic changes in the I-League before. So, there is no harm in hoping that things would go our way at the end of the league.         
	Just think about the way we started in the league, Bhaichung pointed out. We had one point from four matches. Yet we fought back to come to this position. I am sure Mohammedan Sporting can also make a comeback at this stage. That can work to our advantage.         
	Bhaichung admitted that the absence of some key players has put Bagan under pressure. It is definitely difficult to manage things when you miss four top players. But we are not going to leave it so easily. Tomorrow (Thursday) we will go all out for a victory.         
	Bhaichung said he saw nothing wrong in Bagan offering Rs 5 lakh to Mohammedan Sporting if the latter managed to beat Churchill in the concluding encounter.         
	Why is there so much controversy about it, Bhaichung asked. Such things happen all over the world. I can show you many examples. Mohammedan Sporting were only asked to play well. Nobody asked them to lose the match, he said.

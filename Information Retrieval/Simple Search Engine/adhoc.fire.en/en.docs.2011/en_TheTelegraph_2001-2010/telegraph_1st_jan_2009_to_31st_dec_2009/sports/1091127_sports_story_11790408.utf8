The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev, Jyoti open strongly
                                                                                                                       7                                        Jeev, Jyoti open strongly
  - World Cup McIlroy, McDowell hit sizzling 58 to put Ireland in lead             Jeev Milkha Singh           Jyoti Randhawa                            
	Shenzhen: Jeev Milkha Singh and Jyoti Randhawa shared six birdies against a lone bogey to return a steady five-under 67 and take a share of the 15th spot after the opening round of the Omega Mission Hills World Cup of Golf here Thursday.         
	Jeev and Randhawa shot three birdies each in a strong opening day performance.         
	The lone bogey in the card came off Jeevs club on the par-three second hole.         
	Both the players opened with par shots on the first hole and after Jeev had stumbled to a bogey on the second, Randhawa made up for it with a birdie on the third hole.         
	Jeev himself found a birdie on the seventh hole as the Indians combined for one-under at the end of the front-nine.         
	The duo had a blemish-free backward journey and shared four birdies between them to round off creditable show on the opening day of the $5.5 million events 55th edition.         
	Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell tore up the course with a 14-under-par 58 to give Ireland a three-stroke lead after the first-round.         
	Perfect scoring conditions at Mission Hills and the easier better-ball format led to a number of birdies and eagles throughout the field but the sensational round by the two Ulstermen was a class above their rivals.         
	Although a shot short of the World Cup fourballs record, it was enough for a comfortable cushion over second-placed Argentine duo Rafa Echenique and Tano Goya, who carded a 61.         
	World No. 10 McIlroy drained a 20-foot eagle putt at the par-five 15th and was centimetres away from chipping in for another at the next hole before grabbing Irelands 10th and 11th birdies of the day to take the outright lead.         
	McDowell did his bit for the cause too, contributing seven birdies in the blemish-free round, including four as the pair charged through the front nine at seven under and another with a 12-foot putt at the 18th.         
	We got off to a great start today (Thursday) and just kept it going, said the 20-year-old McIlroy, who finished second in a close race for the European No. 1 last week.         
	We birdied a few holes where Im sure not a lot of teams were birdying and no mistakes on the card.         
	We had a look at two birdies most holes and most of the time we took one of them.         
	It was great team play today.         
	The scores are likely to be higher in the more difficult foursomes on Friday but the duo look in good shape to claim Irelands third World Cup and first since Padraig Harrington and Paul McGinley in 1997.         
	Echenique, runner-up at the BMW International Open in June, also eagled the 15th before giving Argentina the clubhouse lead by draining a 20-foot putt on the final green.         
	I hit a great putt and I found the hole, said the 29-year-old.         
	I think it was a great day for us, (but) its a long tournament, and (we) have to be quiet and try to go step by step.         
	The Argentines were matched for most of the day by their playing partners Ryuji Imada and Hiroyuki Fujita of Japan, who carded a 62 for third place ahead of defending champions Sweden, Italy, Canada and South Korea, who all shot 64s.         
	I think we gelled really well, the holes that I struggled, he made pars or birdied and vice versa, and we got it to 10 under, said Imada.         
	World No. 8 Sergio Garcia had a day to forget with only three of his shots counting towards the 69 he and Gonzalo Fernandez Castano posted to give Spain a share of last place in the 28-team field.

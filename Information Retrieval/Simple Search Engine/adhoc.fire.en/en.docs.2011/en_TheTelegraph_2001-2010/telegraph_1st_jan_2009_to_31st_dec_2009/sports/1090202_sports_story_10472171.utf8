                                                   Jhulan: We can reach Cup final
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Jhulan Goswami hopes to emulate Sourav Ganguly. Jhulan said Sunday, after being named the captain, that the Indian team has a realistic chance of reaching the World Cup final. The mega event will be held in Australia from March 7-22.         
	Jhulan will be the second cricketer from Bengal to lead India in a World Cup. The southpaw had led India to the World Cup final in 2003.         
	There were a few glitches in our fielding but we have worked a lot and there will be another camp in Mumbai before we leave for Australia on March 1. Its a big responsibility and I will give my best. I am confident that we will do well and at least be in the final, Jhulan said.

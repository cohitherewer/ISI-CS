The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal moves into Round III
                                                   Nadal moves into Round III
                      
	Indian Wells: World No. 1 Rafael Nadal romped into the third round of the ATP event in Indian Wells on Sunday with a crushing 6-2, 6-1 victory over German Michael Berrer. The Spaniard made mincemeat out of world No. 112 Berrer, marching through in just 67 minutes.         
	Champion Novak Djokovic had a harder time of it before beating Martin Vassallo Arguello of Argentina 7-5, 6-4, while sixth seed Juan Martin Del Potro and number seven Andy Roddick also advanced.         
	Nadal, who will play Dmitry Tursunov in the third round, broke Berrer in the first game and dominated the German from the baseline while outclassing him in every department.         
	Last years finalist Mardy Fish lost 7-6, 7-6 to Frenchman Jeremy Chardy, but David Nalbandian, David Ferrer, Nicolas Kiefer and Stanislas Wawrinka all advanced to the third round.         
	World No.2 Dinara Safina battled into the fourth round on Sunday, beating Peng Shuai of China 7-5 6-4.         
	The Russian top seed, who will take over from Serena Williams at the top of the world rankings if she reaches the final this week, needed one hour, 48 minutes to see off Peng.         
	Safina will now play American Jill Craybas, a surprise 6-4, 6-3 winner over Czech Nicole Vaidisova. (Reuters)

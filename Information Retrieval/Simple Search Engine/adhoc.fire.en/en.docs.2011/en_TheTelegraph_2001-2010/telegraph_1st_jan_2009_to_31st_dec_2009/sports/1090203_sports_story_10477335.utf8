                                                     Steve critical of Ponting
                  Ricky Ponting                     
	Melbourne: Former Australian captain Steve Waugh on Monday raised questions at his embattled successor Ricky Ponting for opting to rest during the one-day series against New Zealand, saying the decision puts a question-mark on his commitment to the team.         
	Theres never an easy time for a captain to rest, said Waugh, who is Pontings predecessor.         
	In these days, with so much cricket happening and the players choosing to play IPL and choosing all these other opportunities, I guess theres got to be question-marks thrown up when people say they want to rest because theyre committing to playing more cricket and you are playing for your country, he was quoted as saying by a website.         
	Ponting, who has not taken a break since Australias tour of India in October last year, has been rested by the Cricket Australia to rejuvenate him for the tour of South Africa.         
	Ponting responded to the criticism saying he was keen to take part but the selectors took the decision.         
	My absolute priority is the Australian cricket team. I wanted to play on through the coming week and continue to lead the team in the series against New Zealand. However, the decision was made by the national selection panel as part of their plan to rest all players at appropriate times during this year, said Ponting.         
	I have reluctantly accepted their decision and will be eagerly awaiting my return to the team, he said.         
	South Africa recently defeated Australia in their own backyard in Tests as well as ODIs to topple them from the number one position.         
	Its a tough one to answer and really Rickys the only one who can answer that. Is he mentally and physically fatigued? Will he come back fresher and stronger for the team? Theyre the questions that people in and around the side have got to answer, Waugh said.         
	Waugh also felt it would be a gamble to take controversial allrounder Andrew Symonds, who is also out-of-form following his knee surgery, to South Africa where the team will play three Tests.

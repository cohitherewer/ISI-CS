The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Cantering win for Abs Fabs
                                                                                                               Cantering win for Abs Fabs 
            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Abs Fabs, the Bangalore challenger, treated the Derby field with absolute disregard, winning the prized event by a proverbial distance. Jockey Francis Norton, who partnered the Arjun Mangalorkar-trained filly to victory, had the 5-4 favourite settled in the mid-division before taking off from the 800m marker. Raghuvansh, though a poor second, had the consolation of leaving the rest of field more than two lengths behind.          
	The Alokananda Cup, too, witnessed an impressive performance from trainer Daniel Davids filly, Cascades, ridden by B. Prakash.          
	Victory also came easy for Darius Byramjis Axiology (C. Alford-up) in The Telegraph Cup. The jockey was the only professional to have scored a treble in the afternoons nine-event card.

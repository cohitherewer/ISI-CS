                                                   Clarke lauds Symmo
                      
	Dubai: Australian captain Michael Clarke said he was pleased with his teams show of character to level the five-match one-day International series against Pakistan on Friday.         
	All-rounder Andrew Symonds took two wickets and then hit a match-winning 58 to help Australia level the series 1-1.         
	We had a good chat after the (first) game and the batters got together and talked about certain things and shared new ideas. James Hopes and Shane Watson gave us a good platform and then Symmo (Symonds) played brilliantly, said Clarke.

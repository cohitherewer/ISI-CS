	Perpignan (France): Frenchman Thomas Voeckler timed his move to perfection to clinch a maiden Tour de France win after an early breakaway surprised the sprinters teams on Wednesday.         
	Bouygues Telecom rider Voeckler attacked a group of breakaway riders with less than five kilometres to go in the 196.5-km fifth stage from Cap dAgde to Perpignan and crossed the line seven seconds ahead of Russian Mikhail Ignatiev.         
	I waited for so long for this to happen I had almost ceased to believe in my chances to win a Tour stage, Voeckler told reporters. Briton Mark Cavendish won the peloton sprint to take third place, also seven seconds adrift of Voeckler, according to provisional results.         
	Swiss Fabian Cancellara retained the overall leaders yellow jersey after finishing safely in the pack and still leads seven-time champion Lance Armstrong by a fraction of a second.         
	American Armstrong and Astana teammate Alberto Contador of Spain had a quiet day. It was an interesting day. Everybody anticipated the wind with what happened two days ago, Armstrong told reporters.         
	Frenchmen Anthony Geslin and Voeckler, Belarussian Yauheni Hutarovich, Dutchman Albert Timmer, Ignatiev and Polands Marcin Sapa broke away in the early stages and built a maximum gap of nine minutes.         
	Cavendishs Columbia team took control of the peloton too late and despite getting help from Agritubel and Garmin-Slipstream they failed to catch the breakaway group. (Reuters)

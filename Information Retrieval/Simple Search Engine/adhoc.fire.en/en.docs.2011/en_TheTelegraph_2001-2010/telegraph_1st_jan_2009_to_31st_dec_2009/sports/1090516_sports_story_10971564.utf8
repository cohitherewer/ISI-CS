The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin spurred Shane on: Berry
                                                     Sachin spurred Shane on: Berry
          
	Durban: The Rajasthan Royals captain Shane Warne, who was almost ruled out of the Indian Premier League with a hamstring injury, made a surprise appearance against the Mumbai Indians on Thursday as he did not want to miss a chance of playing against Sachin Tendulkar.         
	The previous match between the two teams was washed out by rains and so, with Tendulkar again on the opposite side on Thursday, there was no way to stop Warne, who had his leg strapped up, says the Royals director of coaching Darren Berry.         
	We  Jeremy (Snape), the physio, and I  warned Shane against playing the game. But with Tendulkar in their team, there was no way to stop him, Berry said.         
	His leg was strapped up but he said he was playing. And when he says he is playing, it doesnt matter what we are saying, he was quoted as saying by the official IPL website.         
	Acknowledging Man-of-the-Match Warnes role in the win, Berry also showered praise on all his boys for their collective effort to pull off the win in the nerve-wrecking encounter.         
	I think that all the players look up to him (Warne). He enjoys an enormous amount of respect among our group. But, to be honest, it was actually a collective effort from all our players. He is a wonderful captain and tactically very good. The guys believe in him and that is important, Berry said.         
	On playing so many thrillers, Berry said: The Rajasthan Royals have played quite a few of those in the last couple of years.         
	Tonight (Thursday) I think, the most pleasing aspect from our point of view is that we came out on a winning side. It was also a great game of cricket. Both the sides really had a crack at it and it was fantastic. Warne versus Tendulkar  it doesnt get better than this, he added.         
	Berry also lauded the efforts of Munaf Patel and Rob Quiney in the crucial match.         
	Robs innings at the top was important. To come back into the team and get a half-century at the top was good.         
	Full credit to Munaf. With four runs to defend in the last over and with seven wickets down, he pulled it off, he said. (PTI)

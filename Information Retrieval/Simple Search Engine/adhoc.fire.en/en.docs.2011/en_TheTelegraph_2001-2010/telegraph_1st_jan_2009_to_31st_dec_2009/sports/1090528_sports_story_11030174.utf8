	Paris: Maria Sharapova struggled again in her Grand Slam tournament comeback at the French Open, needing three full sets and few extra games to finally reach the third round by beating 11th-seeded Nadia Petrova of Russia 6-2, 1-6, 8-6.         
	Spains Rafael Nadal, the mens top seed, swept past Russias Teimuraz Gabashvili 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 Wednesday on the Suzanne Lenglen court in the second round .         
	Nadal, who is yet to lose at Roland Garros, stretched his French Open record to 30 consecutive victories with this win. This easy victory also gave him a red clay record of the most consecutive wins.         
	The 22-year-old was forced to save three break points in the first game of the match. He only had to save one other the rest of the way.         
	He is trying to become the first player to win five straight French Open titles.         
	Again playing with tape on her troublesome right shoulder, the unseeded Sharapova hung to join top-seeded Dinara Safina and defending champion Ana Ivanovic in the next round.         
	Obviously I am spending a little bit more time out there than I want to, but I think Im learning so many new things, as well, Sharapova said. I think this was a great match where I had to fight my way through many, many challenges. And I did.         
	Sharapova, a three-time Grand Slam champion who has slipped to No. 102 in the rankings because of her injury layoff, won five straight games to close out the first set.         
	Trailing 4-2 in the deciding set, she broke Petrova to get back on serve at 4-4, and then saved two break points to take a 5-4 lead. She saved another break point while serving at 6-6. I got off to a really good start, Sharapova said. I kind of started stumbling away. Things went in the wrong direction. I was just glad I could pick myself up and keep fighting and do the right things, and end the match with a win.         
	Sharapova is making her first Grand Slam appearance in almost a year after missing both the U.S. Open and the Australian Open because of her shoulder injury. She had surgery in October.         
	Safina easily beat 18-year-old Russian qualifier Vitalia Diatchenko 6-1, 6-1, and Ivanovic defeated Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand 6-1, 6-2.         
	Safina took a 5-0 lead to open the match, stretching her streak to 17 straight games after winning 6-0, 6-0 in the first round.         
	Pretty good start for the tournament, said Safina, who lost in the Australian Open final and was the runner-up at Roland Garros last year. I just played a good game, good enough to win.         
	The 153rd-ranked Diatchenko didnt have many break opportunities against Safina.         
	Ivanovic looked more comfortable on court after struggling in her opening match. The eighth-seeded Serb broke the 32-year-old Tanasugarn twice in the first set and three times in the second.         
	The 21-year-old Serb finished with three aces.         
	No. 9 Victoria Azarenka of Belarus also made it through, while No. 21 Alize Cornet of France reached the second round. No. 15 Zheng Jie of China lost.         
	On the mens side, third-seeded Andy Murray defeated Potito Starace of Italy 6-3, 2-6, 7-5, 6-4. The Briton trailed 1-5 in the third set but broke Starace three straight times to win.         
	No. 7 Gilles Simon of France, No. 8 Fernando Verdasco of Spain, No. 12 Fernando Gonzalez of Chile and No. 13 Marin Cilic of Croatia also advanced, but French veteran Fabrice Santoro played his last match at Roland Garros. Santoro, who has made a record 67 Grand Slam appearances, lost in the first round of this years French Open  his record-tying 20th  to Christophe Rochus of Belgium 6-3, 6-1, 3-6, 6-4.         
	No. 21 Dmitry Tursunov of Russia and No. 28 Feliciano Lopez of Spain also lost. (AP)

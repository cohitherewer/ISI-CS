            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The state government Tuesday announced that it had earmarked a plot inside the Salt Lake Stadium complex for the laying of an astroturf surface. The project, when complete, will give the city its second astroturf surface after the one at the Sports Authority of India.         
	State government officials had accompanied a team from the Bengal Hockey Association (BHA) to the stadium on Monday and showed them the plot allocated for the project.         
	The norm in international field hockey, another artificial top in the city has the potential to change the complexion of the game at the local level. Something that BHA secretary Gurbux Singh knows very well, having always advocated the use of artificial surface in local hockey.         
	An elated Gurbux, welcoming the move, said that funding for the enterprise had been promised by the Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, who is also the chief patron of the association. It was learnt that the state government, too, has offered help.         
	The Indian Football Association, too, has asked for land for its own stadium and state sports minister Kanti Ganguly has said that they would receive the same, although when and where is not clear as yet.

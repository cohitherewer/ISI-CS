	Calcutta: Asian U-12 boys champion Diptayan Ghosh of South Point was held to a draw by his schoolmate Aritra Acharya in the 3rd round of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship, being presented by Himani Sona Chandi Chawyanprash and organised by Alekhine Chess Club, at Gorky Sadan on Thursday.         
	Top seed Sayantan Das of Scottish Church Collegiate School had to sweat it out against Asian U-8 Girls champion Khushi Dharewa of Ashok Hall. Khushi put up a stubborn defence in a Ruy Lopez despite being a pawn down in a rook and pawn endgame. Sayantan created a passed pawn on the kingside which proved decisive.         
	The Asian U-8 silver medallist Arpita Mukherjee of Sishu Bharti, too, put up an impressive show to hold rated Anubhab Mondal of Shree Jain Vidyalaya for Boys with the black pieces in the ultra sharp Sicilian Seveshnikov.         
	Anubhab made the thematic sacrifice of his bishop for two pawns on b5 and followed it up by an attack on his opponents king. Arpita held her position and Anubhav decided to sign truce by a perpetual check.         
	Second seed Satyajit Kundu of Vivekananda Mission School won the rook for knight against Rittick Purkait of St Xaviers Collegiate School .         
	Chandrasish Majumdar of St Xaviers Collegiate School faced little resistance from Abhirup Das of Kanailal Vidyamandir as his opponent lost the queen and the game in a Sicilian Maroczy.

	Birmingham: Michael Clarke scored 103 not out as Australia batted out a draw Monday, the final day of the third Ashes Test against England. England leads the five match series 1-0.         
	Clarke added 185 with Marcus North (96) for the fifth wicket to help Australia reach 375 for five when stumps were drawn. Australia held a lead of 262 runs in their second innings with England still to bat again after the whole of Saturday was lost to rain and 60 overs on Thursday.         
	We knew what job we had to do this morning. The North-Clarke partnership was something special. They controlled things perfectly and it ended up being a reasonable game of cricket considering the amount of time we lost (to rain), Australia captain Ricky Ponting said.         
	It was Clarkes 12th century in his 50th Test, while North fell to a spectacular diving one-handed catch by fast bowler James Anderson at gully off Stuart Broad after tea. Both were mostly untroubled on a flat last day pitch at Edgbaston, though Clarke was caught by slip fielder Anderson off Ravi Bopara off a no-ball when on 96.         
	Australia, seeking to retain the Ashes, lost only three wickets in the day after resuming on 88 for two from overnight and under pressure as England had obtained a first innings lead of 113 runs.         
	The ball wasnt swinging, we tried a few options but it just wasnt to be today (Monday) unfortunately, England captain Andrew Strauss said. We grabbed the initiative in the match but we couldnt close it out today. The teams will now meet again at Headingley on Friday before the final game at The Oval.         
	Clarke, who also made 136 at Lords in the second Test that England won, and North successfully blunted Englands attack for 209 minutes. Clarke was dropped on 38 by England captain Andrew Strauss from a powerful pull shot at short mid-wicket but it was a rare lapse in his 283-minute stay.         
	The only other near-miss came when Clarke (on 43) was caught by wicket-keeper Matt Prior off his boot from Graeme Swanns bowling and though England appealed nosily and caused umpire Rudi Koertzen to consult his fellow umpire and the third umpire, the correct not out decision was the end result.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murray has a new fan
                                                   Murray has a new fan
                      
	London: Such is Britains desperation for a first Wimbledon mens champion since 1936 that even Queen Elizabeth II has joined the Andy Murray fan club.         
	The third seed, eased into the third round on Thursday with a 6-2, 7-5, 6-3 win over Latvias Ernests Gulbis and next faces Serbias Viktor Troicki for a place in the last 16.         
	Murray revealed that he had received a letter from Buckingham Palace congratulating him on his recent performances.         
	It was surprising. You dont get that every day, he said. The letter said well done for winning at Queens and good luck here, that was the gist of it. Someone from the All England Club gave it to me and told me who it was from.

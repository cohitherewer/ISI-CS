The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ricky unhappy with conduct
                                                                                                                       7                                        Ricky unhappy with conduct
                  Ricky Ponting                     
	Melbourne: Shane Watson is not embarrassed by his on-field antics but Australian skipper Ricky Ponting is and will talk to his players about their on-field behaviour.         
	The third Test between Australia and the West Indies was marred by a few ugly incidents, involving players from both the sides.         
	Watson was fined 15 per cent of his match fee for his wild celebration after dismissing rival captain Chris Gayle on Saturday.         
	Before that Brad Haddin and Mitchell Johnson were also fined for their run-in with Windies spinner Sulieman Benn, who was banned for two one-day matches.         
	Doug Bollinger was also fined for kicking the pitch in Adelaide.         
	The behaviour of the Australians invited criticism from all sides and Ponting wants to make sure that his teammates do not repeat such acts in the series against Pakistan.         
	I know all the guys are a bit embarrassed probably and know theyve overstepped the mark.         
	Its one of my responsibilities as the captain to make sure that guys arent overstepping the mark.         
	This week when we get down to Melbourne as a group, it will happen in our first team meeting, we will go over some of the events of this week, Ponting was quoted as saying by a newspaper.         
	However, Watson justified his action, saying he was provoked by Gayle, thus that send off.         
	There was a bit of build up to it, so its always nice to get Chris Gayle out, hes obviously one of the most devastating batsmen in the world at the moment.         
	He definitely let me know that he was keen for me to come on to bowl leading up to that, so it was very nice to get him out first ball, he was quoted as saying.         
	The thing I want to get across is knowing that there is two sides to the story, Watson said.         
	Unfortunately Ive gone over the top with this one but there was a reason for it. Chris was challenging me, saying he was looking forward to me coming on.         
	That was the catalyst for me celebrating the way I did. I know theres a line and I was extremely happy to get him out, I normally dont celebrate to that extent when I get someone out.         
	He was winding me up, claiming that he likes my bowling and wants to take me down. It was such an emotional celebration because I got him out with my first ball after getting challenged, Watson said.         
	But when he baits me, talking about wanting me to come on to bowl to be able to take me down, its always very nice to get the upper hand, the all-rounder added.         
	Australia retained the Frank Worrell Trophy, beating the West Indies 2-0 in the recently concluded three-match Test series.         
	The Caribbeans were expected to be beaten easily, and their loss in the first Test heightened the expectations of a clean sweep by Pontings men.         
	However, Gayle and his teammates came back superbly to draw the second Test, where they held the upper hand for a long time.         
	Then in the third Test in Perth, they ran the Australians close.           (PTI)

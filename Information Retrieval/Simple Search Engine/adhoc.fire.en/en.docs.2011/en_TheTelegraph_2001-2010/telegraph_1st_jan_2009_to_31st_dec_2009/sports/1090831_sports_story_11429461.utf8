                                                     India believe they can beat odds
            JAYDEEP BASU             Bhaichung Bhutia in New Delhi on Sunday. A Telegraph picture Committee to solve Bhutia impasse: Page 15                           
	New Delhi: India will have a date with history when Bhaichung Bhutias men take on Syria in the ONGC Nehru Cup final at the Ambedkar Stadium on Monday.         
	Indian football has never had it so good at the international level, not even in the 60s when they won the Asian Games gold in Jakarta. This team has made four finals in two years and is looking for a hattrick of titles on home soil.         
	To say India have a good chance of retaining the Nehru Cup wont be an exaggeration. Two years ago when India and Syria crossed swords in the final at the same venue, the home team was regarded as permanent underdogs in international meets. But ever since coach Bob Houghtons boys won Nehru Cup 2007, things have changed.         
	Under Houghton, the Indians are a much more assertive lot, even while going through a rough patch. Although India have lost two of their four group league matches in the current edition, they have looked good to topple their opponents.         
	It is this new-found confidence, coupled with a positive approach, that may carry India past their taller rivals on Monday. This despite the fact that the Indian defence has some gaping holes and the midfield is not showing the same flair that won them the AFC Challenge Cup last year.         
	Weve had a great run in the last two years, Houghton said. Compared to other Asian countries, like Japan, Korea or some of the west Asian nations, the facilities in India are light years behind. Yet these boys have done a great job since August 2007.         
	Houghton said there would be no change in the first team that has played all the matches except the inconsequential match against Syria on Saturday, which the hosts lost 0-1. Syria are a good team, perhaps better than the one that played against us two years ago. But my boys are ready for the challenge.         
	Syria, definitely the best team in the tournament, are ranked 61 places above India in the Fifa rankings. To get the better of them, the Indian midfield, especially Climax Lawrence and N.P. Pradeep need to play bigger roles in the attacking third. While Lawrence has remained subdued throughout, Pradeep is certainly not the same player who hammered the last nail in Syrias coffin with a spectacular goal in the 2007 final.         
	Thankfully for India, Steven Dias is once again doing a great job on the right. In 2007, the Syrian coach Fajer Ebrahim had described Dias as too good. This time too, the Mahindra midfielder is likely to be the source of attacks for the home team.         
	In the end, two players  Bhaichung Bhutia and Subrata Paul  are again expected to make all the difference. While the captain seems to be an ageless wonder who comes to Indias rescue every time the team finds the going tough, Paul has the ability to become one of Indias greatest ever under the bar.         
	Syria have come with only 17 players but most of them are taller than the Indians. Neither are they lacking in skills. The man to be watched should be defender Ali Dyab, also a fine executor of set-pieces, Indias biggest weakness on the field.         
	Bhaichung knows what is expected of him, but the captain was in no mood to talk much about Mondays crucial encounter. All I can say is that this Syrian team is better than the one that came in 2007. Thankfully, all the boys are fit and raring to go. The best thing would be to get an early goal. That will put us in an advantageous position, Bhaichung said.         
	But then, Indias biggest advantage would be the highly vociferous crowd that has given unconditional support to Houghtons men from day one. On Monday, they will be there in huge numbers to become a part of history. There will also be help from the stars; Salman Khan will be the chief guest.         
	Time Bhaichung and his men obliged the fans.

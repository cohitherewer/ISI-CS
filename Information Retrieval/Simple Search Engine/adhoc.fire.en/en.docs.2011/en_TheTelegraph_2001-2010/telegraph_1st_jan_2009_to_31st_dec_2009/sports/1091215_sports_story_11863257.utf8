  - Bindra to assess Fort Lauderdale facilities       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Bindra                                 
	Rajkot: Floridas Fort Lauderdale may host T20 Internationals between Test-playing nations either before or after next summers World T20, in the West Indies.         
	The tournament will be staged between April 30-May 16.         
	Ill soon be in the US and Ill visit Fort Lauderdale to assess the facilities there. If matches can be hosted, then we may have T20 Internationals, either next April or in May, the International Cricket Council (ICC)s principal adviser, Inderjit Singh Bindra, told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Monday, he added: Once the facilities are approved, well talk to the Boards and try and arrange the matches according to their convenience  either on their way to the West Indies or on the way back after the World T20...         
	Bindra, a former president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, said that the T20 Internationals would be one big way of promoting cricket in the US.         
	He pointed out that the 50-over ODIs probably wouldnt at all be well received in the US, where expats from India, Pakistan and the West Indies have been doing their bit for cricket.         
	The US and China are key areas for the ICC in its push for globalisation, a move initiated by Jagmohan Dalmiya, when he was its president (1997-2000).

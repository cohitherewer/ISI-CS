The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Red Devils supporter stabbed in Rome
                                                   Red Devils supporter stabbed in Rome
                      
	Rome: A Manchester United fan was hospitalised after suffering a stab wound and nine people, including both United and Barcelona supporters, were arrested by Italian police in separate incidents ahead of the Champions League final in Rome.         
	As up to 50,000 United and Barcelona supporters converged on Rome for Wednesday nights game, huge numbers of police patrolled the city. While many fans peacefully flooded the cobble-stoned streets of Rome, scattered episodes of violence were reported in and outside the Italian capital.         
	Police said that a United fan was taken to the Santo Spirito hospital after he was stabbed in the thigh in the early hours of Wednesday morning. They did not identify the victim.         
	The fan told investigators that four attackers who spoke Spanish attacked him near his hotel in the Vatican area. He was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday afternoon.         
	Separately, two United fans were arrested for assaulting bystanders and police in Campo de Fiori, a popular square in the heart of Rome which is lined with pubs and cafes.         
	Police said the men, aged 19 and 45 but not identified, were drunk despite a ban on alcohol sales imposed by authorities in areas including the city centre and near the stadium. They will watch the match from a TV inside the Regina Coeli prison, said a police statement.         
	Three Barcelona fans were arrested after a police search in their car turned up blunt objects, including clubs and a javelin, police said. The three were travelling from Civitavecchia, a port near Rome where hundreds of Spanish fans had arrived by ship.         
	In yet another incident, four Italians were arrested in Ostia, on the coast near Rome, after they attacked an American, apparently mistaking him for a United supporter. The US citizen was beaten up and had been stabbed in his thigh and backside, police said.         
	Some 30,000 fans from England and 20,000 from Spain arrived, largely on dozens of charter flights at Romes airports.         
	Authorities have been monitoring hardcore fans of Romes local teams amid concerns that they might seek to ambush visiting supporters. AS Roma fans especially were being kept under close watch as they clashed with United supporters in Rome in 2007, stabbing a number of them.         
	With hours to go before the match, the fans flooded the city centre, snapping pictures at the Colosseum and sporting the colours of their teams. Fans wore flags as capes and one Spanish woman, in honour of the host city, had a Barcelona flag wrapped around her like a toga.         
	Hundreds attended Pope Benedict XVIs weekly public audience at the Vatican, waving their flags and scarves before the pontiff. The match referee, Massimo Busacca of Switzerland, greeted the pope at the end of the audience.         
	Some 67,000 people were expected to pack the Stadio Olimpico for club footballs most prestigious event. Among attending VIPs were the Spanish royals and Britains Prince William, who was invited by the English Football Association as the organisations president.         
	Thousands of law enforcement officials have been deployed around the stadium and in the city centre, at airports and subway stops. Others were guarding Romes monuments and other artistic treasures.         
	About 1,000 stewards will be deployed inside the stadium, and 30 police officers from England and Spain, some mingling with the fans in plainclothes, were also on hand to help the Italians.         
	There is too much security in the city. You cant get near the stadium; its full of police, complained Alan Timperley, a 48-year-old United fan who planned to watch the match at a tent camp gathering of United fans on the outskirts of Rome.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Security for Sourav sans police
                                                                                                                       7                                      Security for Sourav sans police
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengals next Ranji Trophy encounter against Saurashtra from Tuesday has been shifted to the Jadavpur University, Salt Lake campus ground, as the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) wants to speed up the renovation work at Eden Gardens.         
	In all likelihood, the second home match of the season, which will again feature former India captain Sourav Ganguly, will be held at the university ground sans police presence.         
	Around 35 private security men will be deputed so that there is no security problem. We will also get in touch with the district police authorities, but it is unlikely that police would be deployed inside a university campus. There might be a couple of policemen but we will not be able to arrange for a proper force, joint secretary Biswarup Dey said Thursday.         
	The CAB is also planning to keep the Bengal players in a hotel on Monday since the SUCI has announced a bandh on the following day  the first day of the match.         
	Meanwhile, the CAB has decided to call the representatives of the 121 affiliated units in order to discuss the distribution of tickets for the India vs Sri Lanka ODI on December 24.         
	Due to renovation, there will only be complimentary tickets this time. With approximately 45,000 seats available, the CAB will be left with barely 10,000 tickets after distributing the quota of tickets.

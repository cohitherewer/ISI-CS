The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United pay the penalty
                                                   United pay the penalty
                      
	Wembley: Tim Howard stopped two penalty kicks Sunday to give Everton a 4-2 shootout victory over Manchester United and a first FA Cup final appearance in 14 years.         
	The teams had drawn 0-0 through extra time of the semi-finals at Wembley before the American goalkeeper blocked shots from Dimitar Berbatov and Rio Ferdinand to help put Everton into next months final against Chelsea.         
	Defender Phil Jagielka then scored the winning kick, with only Tim Cahill missing for Everton.         
	A United team mostly composed of reserve players had been marginally the better side through regular time but needed goalkeeper Ben Foster to stop an extra time shot to the far post by Cahill, who was then unlucky to be denied a run on goal with 10 minutes left when the referee ruled he had won the ball with a foul.         
	United manager Alex Fergusons gamble on playing a reserve team seemingly backfired as Danny Welbeck, Frederico Macheda and Darron Gibson struggled to force clear openings against an organised Everton team.         
	Trying to conserve resources for the continued defence of his clubs Premier League and Champions League titles, Ferguson left Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick, Ryan Giggs and Edwin van der Sar out of his squad.         
	His starting line-up had just 106 Premier League starts between them this season  compared to 327 for an Everton side as strong as injuries would allow.         
	Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic were the only first-team regulars in Uniteds starting line-up, with four players not beginning a Premier League match this season and another trio totalling just 19 starts between them.         
	In Sundays Premier League games, Darren Bents goal gave Tottenham a 1-0 victory over Newcastle to push the Magpies closer to relegation and Robinho scored his first in 12 games in Manchester Citys 4-2 triumph over last-place West Bromwich Albion.

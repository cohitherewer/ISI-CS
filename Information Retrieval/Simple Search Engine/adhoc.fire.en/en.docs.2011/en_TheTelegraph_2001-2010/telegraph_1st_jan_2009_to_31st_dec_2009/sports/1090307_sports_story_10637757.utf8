                                                   We fought well, says Subhas
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: East Bengal striker Sunil Chetri suffered an ankle injury during the I-League match against Mahindra United at the Cooperage, here on Friday. He has a swelling. The extent of the injury will be known only after the tests are done, coach Subhas Bhowmick said.         
	Subhas blamed the chance factor for the loss but said he was happy with his teams performance.         
	The chance factor is very vital. To concede two penalties in one match, Subhas said. The first penalty was doubtful. To me it was a dive. The second was okay.         
	Subhas was all praises for his players. One plus point today (Friday) was the boys never gave up, he said.         
	Subhas said he missed the services of M Suresh, Ismael Addo and Yusif Yakubu. Without them our balance was missing, the coach added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A captain has to put his stamp on the job, says Ian Chappell
                                                     A captain has to put his stamp on the job, says Ian Chappell
    - Living legend assesses todays test captains             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI       A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL            Ian Chappell                                 
	London: Few cricketers need absolutely no introduction and Ian Chappell is one such. The living legend spoke to The Telegraph for over half-an-hour the other day.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Over time, has the role of captains changed?         
	A Im not out on the field, so its a bit hard to tell... But I dont think it wouldve changed much... The one definite change is that there are a lot more media commitments for a captain... I dont, however, see why he has to appear for so many press conferences...         
	What about the other areas?         
	I suppose there has been a change where building team spirit and running a team is concerned, not necessarily for the better... I say that because, nowadays, you have coaches and Ive always maintained that only one bloke  the captain  can run a team.         
	But why this constant opposition to the presence of coaches?         
	My philosophy is simple: If all the wins and losses are going to go against my name, then I must have a fair say in what were doing... If things dont work and I get sacked then, at least, Ill know that I did it my way... But if Im trying to please everybody (including the coach), then its nonsense... I wouldnt stand for somebody else having a fair input into what will clearly influence the W and L columns of my captaincy.         
	What if this business of coaches had been there in your time?uld have to choose between having me as captain and having a coach. Take your pick... I would never delegate things on which winning and losing hinge on.         
	Besides the overall coaches, nowadays, one also sees specialist ones in bowling and fielding. Isnt the captains role getting diluted even more?         
	Foolish captains will allow a dilution... Despite coaches, the better captains will still be smart enough to run things themselves.         
	Control of the dressing room has led to tension between some captains and coaches...         
	Well, boards wont do away with coaches... In my view, though, they arent necessary.         
	So, whats your advice for captains?         
	(Grins) Run the game... Do it your way and be honest.         
	Who would qualify as an ideal captain?         
	Its a bit like batting... If you look at Australias top six in my time, then youll see they all did things their way, but all were effective... So, theres no ideal captain or, to put it another way, theres no formula... But, yes, a captain has to be decisive and has to be a good player... One of the reasons why I like the Australian system is that it picks the team first and then the captain. It shouldnt be the other way, which is followed in quite a few countries. People said Mike Brearley was a good captain, but the only series he captained against a good team, he lost 0-3 (1979-80, in Australia)... Its tough enough playing 11 versus 11, but when you have a captain who isnt really good enough to hold his place then, in effect, youre playing 10 versus 11... If you cant find a captain from within the 11 best cricketers, then theres something wrong with that countrys system.         
	Is there a type not worthy of the captaincy?         
	The ones who get weighed down by responsibility... Somebody wholl worry shouldnt get the job... The best way to learn about captaincy is to do it... Sadly, nowadays, international cricketers dont get to play much first-class cricket at home and, so, the captains arent able to learn and improve because they dont lead at the domestic level... Eventually, a captain has to put his stamp on the job.         
	A few words on the Test captains (alphabetically) of each of the nine countries regularly playing at that level...         
	 Mohammed Ashraful: Hes been saddled with a job he probably isnt fit to do... Bangladesh are a basket case and I dont think it would matter who captains them.         
	 Mahendra Singh Dhoni: Hes a good captain... He thinks aggressively and is decisive with his thought process... He looks to be a guy who is running the Indian side... Has been buoyed by the responsibility.         
	 Chris Gayle: Youve got a problem when the captain basically indicates that he doesnt want to be there... Thats hes just keeping the seat warm for somebody... If I was the chairman of selectors in the West Indies, he wouldnt be keeping the captains seat warm, but sitting on another seat.         
	 Younis Khan: The difficulty with Pakistan is that there generally are three-four guys in the side who think they can captain just as well... Except the time Imran (Khan) was captain and briefly under Wasim (Akram), youve generally had a situation when all 11 havent necessarily been going in the same direction... The captain has a tough job.         
	 Ricky Ponting: Hes good... What Ive been disappointed about is that Punter is his nickname, but he hasnt taken his gambling instincts on to the cricket field... Hes a bit conservative for my liking, but could turn around and say that Australia wins 70 or so per cent of the matches and that his method works. Despite the huge turnover of players, he has kept things together.         
	 Kumar Sangakkara: Another good captain... Hes an aggressive cricketer and everything he does tells the opposition that hes there to win... Thats an important aspect of captaincy. Sri Lankas in good hands.         
	 Graeme Smith: Hes improved as captain... In his early days, hed lacked imagination... But, then, that was the method of South African cricket  not veering from the chosen path... What is helping him now is that the attack has a bit more variety... He cant do much more than get better at the job.         
	 Andrew Strauss: I havent really seen much of him, but hes a sensible person and, so, should be a decent captain for England... Hes intelligent too... Ill be able to judge him better after the Ashes.         
	 Daniel Vettori: Very potent cricketer, but hasnt got much to work with in the New Zealand team... Hes done pretty well with the limited resources... Shane Bonds return will help.         
	Has T20 complicated matters for captains?         
	It gets complicated if you make it complicated... The problem with modern-day cricket is that captains sit down with the (support) group, watch videos and plan... Thats mostly a lot of rubbish... You cant take the field and say right, this is the plan... Thats not how it works... Youve got to adapt... If you show me a plan for a batsman which works, then Ill show you a pretty ordinary batsman... I dont, for example, understand why captains allow a single on the last ball of an over to get at a tailender... Why cant they get the more recognised batsman? The message they send out is that they cant get him, which is nonsense... The fellows who keep a captain awake at night are the ones capable of big scores  Garfield Sobers, Viv Richards, Graeme Pollock, Clive Lloyd... And, in more recent years, guys like Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara... Not somebody like Geoffrey Boycott, who would take too long...         
	The final one: A couple of months ago, John Buchanan floated the idea of multiple captains in T20. Your take?         
	Just confirmed for me that Buchanan doesnt know much about cricket!

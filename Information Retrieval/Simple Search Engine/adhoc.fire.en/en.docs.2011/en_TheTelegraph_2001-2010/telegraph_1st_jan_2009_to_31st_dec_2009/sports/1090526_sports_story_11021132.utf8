                                                   Kumble outsmarted me beautifully, says Gilly
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                                  
	Johannesburg: Last year it was Shane Warne. This year it was Adam Gilchrist. Another Australian cricketing legend has helped pull off an IPL victory for his team. After the win on Sunday night at the Wanderers, a delighted Deccan Chargers captain spoke to the media.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Andrew Symonds brought you back in the game with his wickets and some great fielding. Dont you think he should be in the Australian national side?         
	Yes, I was surprised. He would be in my team but its not my job to pick the team for Australia. They have been well-served by some fine cricketers. Andrew Symonds He has been such a team man. He creates great spirit in the team and we saw a little glimpse of that last year in the IPL when he was only there for four games. He became an instant favourite this year in the team.         
	You have won three World Cups and now this IPL. How does it compare to those wins?         
	I wont say ones better than the other. Its what is important at that time. This is the only cricket I play now. Given what we went through last year, this is really a phenomenal effort by the whole franchise, to turn it around.         
	Two young Indians in Pragyan Ojha and Rohit Sharma have served you well. Your thoughts on that?                 
	Both are very talented and exciting cricketers. Rohit I have really enjoyed working with him. I tried to encourage him to assume that leadership role, hoping that he would learn some leadership skills along the way, which I think he has. His cricket speaks for itself. He is very talented. And so is Pragyan. If both of them continue to have that desire to learn and absorb as much as they can from the cricketers and experience around them, they will be wonderful cricketers for India.         
	What did you make of the way Anil Kumble bowled in the match?         
	I am still trying to get the hook out of my mind when he threw that one up. He outsmarted me today beautifully. I am thrilled for him and their franchise and the way they turned it around. They experienced a lot of pain and disappointment that we faced last year. As he said today morning, who would have thought that last year we were playing for the wooden spoon and this year we were playing for the title. All credit to him. It is no surprise that a guy like Anil turns out to be a standout performer. His leadership I think, from an outside observer looking in He is a natural leader.         
	Did you make a prediction note before the final like you did for the semi-final?         
	You will think I am nuts but I woke up this morning at 2.30. I just couldnt sleep I was too excited, I was a little nervous. My mind was racing. At 3.16, I decided I am going to make another bold prediction and I wrote that Pragyan Ojha will be the Man of the Match. And I thought he was close with three for 24. I am human, I cant predict everything. I didnt predict we will win!         
	Rajasthan Royals last year and Deccan Chargers this year. What worked for the teams?         
	We felt like we were coming in as one of the least favourite teams. I really encouraged my team to play everything down, to fly under the radar. We were happy with the fact that there were no expectations from us.         
	You captained the sides for a few games last year as well. What has been special this time?         
	Last year was just a very hollow feeling. It was a learning experience for me because I have been lucky to have played in a lot of winning teams in the Australian set-up. To go in that sort of losing streak was new to me and I knew at that time that I wanted to just try and embrace it and work out why. A couple of personnel changes We needed a little more strike-power in our bowling and we got that in Fidel Edwards and Ryan Harris. We needed that firepower to support RP (Singh). The owners showed faith in me when I suggested a few changes. The main one was Darren Lehmann. He has got a wonderful cricket mind. He was the first person I thought of when I sensed an opportunity to bring in some freshness and some new people. Also, we tried to play a smarter brand of Twenty20 cricket rather than just going out together and trying to literally fire from ball one.

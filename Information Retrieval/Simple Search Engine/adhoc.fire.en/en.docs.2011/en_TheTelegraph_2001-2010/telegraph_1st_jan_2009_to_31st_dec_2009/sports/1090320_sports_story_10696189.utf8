                                                   Nirat sets record, stays in lead
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Gurgaon: Big hitting Chapchai Nirat of Thailand continued his dazzling form in the SAIL Open on Thursday when he established a new 36-hole scoring record on the Asian Tour at the sprawling Classic Golf Resort here.         
	Nirat, who fired a second successive 10-under 62, opened up a four-stroke lead over Mark Purser of New Zealand at the halfway stage in the $300,000 tournament.         
	His total of 20-under also erased the old record of 17-under for two rounds created by three players, including Chapchai himself.         
	Among the Indians, Gaganjeet Bhullar (64) turned out to be the best and is placed fourth. All my putts were within 10 feet today, Bhullar said later.         
	I also did well with the lob wedge and sand wedge in Round 2, having made some good chips.         
	S.S.P. Chowrasia had a rather subdued second round that made his title aspirations look like a distant dream. At the end of the second day, Chowrasia is placed 30th with four others.         
	The Calcutta pro began in the right earnest, picking up a shot on the opening hole. The third hole bogey, however, left him level-par and even though birdies were up for grabs in the benign layout, Chowrasia did not benefit.         
	His back nine was hardly any different with the lone birdie of the stretch coming on the 14th hole.         
	Jyoti Randhawa hit three birdies in the last six holes and managed to make the cut at four-under after being on the verge of elimination at one-under after 12 holes in the second round.         
	There were two double-digit sub-par scores, one from Chapchai and another from Anirban Lahiri of India, who followed his first round 72 with a 62 to go 10-under and jump from tied 96th to tied 10th.         
	Listening to a meditation track, Lahiri said, helped him to improve his game. There is a meditation track that I listen to when I feel stressed and that track helped me relax today. I knew I had to shoot at least four or five-under to make it to the weekend. I seemed to be in my elements.         
	Three other Indians, Rahil Gangjee (67), Shiv Kapur (66) and C. Muniyappa (66) were all tied for 10th at 10-under 134 in a tournament, where low scores have been the feature.         
	Gangjee, who has been working on the mental toughness part, after missing out on his Asian Tour card last year, said he has gained a lot from the hard work.         
	All the work that I have put in with my hypnotherapist Pradeep Aggarwal seems to be paying off. There is a change in my approach on the course and my demeanour. Its nice to be rewarded.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | For Sachin, cricket an addiction: Borde
                                                                                                                                     For Sachin, cricket an addiction: Borde
  - Former India captain, and Tendulkars first manager, on the legend       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Chandu Borde                                 
	Puri: Former captain and chief selector Chandu Borde, whod been the India manager in Sachin Tendulkars debut series (Pakistan, 1989-90) got delayed at church and was hoping he hadnt missed the chance to wish Little Master II.         
	Exactly 20 years later, Im amazed by two things  Sachins hunger for runs and his enormous energy level... The guys incredible... For Sachin, cricket is an addiction, nothing less, Borde told The Telegraph from his Pune residence, on Sunday.         
	Looking back on that tour of Pakistan, he said: You, too, were there and may recall that Sachin would be the last to leave the nets... The groundsmen, I think, used to pray for the 16-year-old to pack up, so that their day could also end somewhat!         
	In fact, even in the area around the dressing rooms, Sachin would find some space for Salil Ankola (the quick, who had a short career) to throw tennis balls at him... The commitment was so much in evidence right then itself.         
	But, surely, who wouldve known that Sachin would become the master that he is?         
	One cant, of course, make such predictions... However, when Sachin didnt go off the field after getting hit on the face by Waqar Younis (Sialkot, last Test), I did realise that he was someone who would serve India for long and with distinction... Sachin has proved me right... That 57 in the second innings ranks as one of his best, Borde replied.         
	[Incidentally, on becoming the India captain for the first time, in 1996-97, Sachin had told this Reporter that retiring wouldve been like accepting defeat at the hands of Pakistan. Such a move, then, wasnt an option for him.]         
	Borde made the point that Sachin quickly grew in stature as a batsman, learnt to improvise and torment bowlers even more. As a person, though, he just didnt change.         
	Sachin has stayed so humble... What I particularly like about him is that he greets the former players respectfully... Sachin is a good listener as well and isnt opposed to experimenting with an idea suggested by somebody, Borde maintained.         
	He added: My message to Sachin on the day he has completed 20 years of international cricket would be very simple  keep playing! Encourage us to dream big and keep entertaining...         
	That Borde sentiment would, clearly, find an echo across the country and beyond.

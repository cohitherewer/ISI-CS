	London: England will play five bowlers in the second Ashes Test against Australia starting at Lords Thursday after releasing reserve batsman Ian Bell.         
	England captain Andrew Strauss told a news conference Wednesday the hosts would probably play four pace bowlers with the final choice depending on the fitness of all-rounder Andrew Flintoff.         
	The indications are that hes going to be fine. At this stage we are hopeful but we cant be certain. We just have to see how he reacts to what he did today (Wednesday), he said.         
	This week in all likelihood there will maybe be four seamers and he wont have so big a workload.         
	Flintoff, who announced on Wednesday he will retire from Test cricket at the end of the series, bowled for the first time since suffering pain and swelling in his right knee during the drawn first Test in Cardiff.         
	Asked if he would be fit, Flintoff replied: Hopefully, providing there are no ill-effects overnight.         
	If Flintoff does play, left-arm spinner Monty Panesar is likely to step down with the final choice resting between Durham pace bowlers Steve Harmison and Graham Onions.         
	Harmison, who has been consistently hostile in county cricket this season after disappointing in the West Indies, was added to the squad as cover for Flintoff.         
	Australia look certain to retain the side who dominated the Cardiff match before tailenders James Anderson and Panesar held on for an unlikely draw.         
	Australia captain Ricky Ponting said fast bowler Brett Lee, who injured a rib muscle before Cardiff, would not be considered for selection. He didnt train with us yesterday (Tuesday) He wont be available for selection for this game, he said.         
	We obviously needed him to do a bit more bowling than that before this Test, Ponting told reporters.         
	Hopefully, hell come up for the tour game between this and the third Test (at Edgbaston starting on July 30).         
	Lee pulled a muscle in a warm-up game prior to last weeks drawn opener in Cardiff.         
	Speaking on their record at Lords, Ponting said: There is a great feel around the place, and all the history, and the very proud record that Australia have had here for so long makes you feel good about the place when you arrive.         
	Already the guys were talking about our record here in the team meeting and how much everyone has been looking forward to playing here, and what it means to a lot of our younger guys in particular to play here.

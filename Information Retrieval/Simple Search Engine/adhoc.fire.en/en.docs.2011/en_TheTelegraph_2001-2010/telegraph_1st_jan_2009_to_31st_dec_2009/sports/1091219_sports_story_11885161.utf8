	Centurion: England batsmen put up a gutsy fight as they lowered South Africas first lead to 62 runs in the first Test at Supersport Park on Friday. England finished their first innings on 356.         
	The visitors then struck an early blow to leave the Proteas on nine for one at stumps. South Africa have an overall lead of 71 runs.         
	The Proteas would have expected a bigger lead with the tourists on 242 for eight when Stuart Broad was dismissed shortly after tea. But Graeme Swann and James Anderson added 106 runs.

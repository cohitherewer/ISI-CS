The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Miandad is Pakistan batting consultant
                                                   Miandad is Pakistan batting consultant
                      
	Karachi: Former captain Javed Miandad, also the director general of Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), was Thursday entrusted with the additional responsibility of batting consultant for the national team.         
	PCB chairman Ejaz Butt said that Miandad has been asked to work with Pakistan batsmen and prepare them for the Champions Trophy.         
	Miandad will help and assist in preparing the Pakistan batsmen for the Champions Trophy in South Africa, Butt said after the PCB governing bodys meeting.         
	We have grey areas in the batting department and we want to work on those areas, he said.         
	Miandads huge experience and vast knowledge of the game made him an obvious choice for the job and the former captain has agreed to accept his new role, he added.         
	Miandad, however, would not accompany the team to South Africa in September, the PCB chairman said.         
	Butt revealed former opener Saeed Anwar has also offered his services and said the PCB would consider his case.         
	The appointment of the 51-year-old comes after Pakistans humiliating 0-2 defeat in Tests and 2-3 loss in the one-day series in Sri Lanka, results which were blamed on Pakistans poor performance with the bat.         
	Pakistan finished the tour with a 52-run win in the Twenty20 match against Sri Lanka on Wednesday.         
	Needing 97 to win on the fourth day of the first Test in Galle, Pakistan suffered a dramatic collapse, losing eight wickets to crash to a 50-run defeat.         
	In the second Test they found themselves in a commanding position of 285 for one only to throw away nine wickets for a paltry 35 runs, handing Sri Lanka a seven-wicket victory.         
	Miandad is regarded as one of Pakistans greatest batsmen, scoring 8832 runs in 124 Tests  still a Pakistan record  and 7381 runs in 233 ODIs.         
	We had batting failures and I will be meeting each and every player here on Friday, said Butt.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Delhi heat hits Lewis
                                                   Delhi heat hits Lewis
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Lewis Hamilton seems all for the proposed Indian Grand Prix in 2011. Only, he hates the heat. One afternoon in the scorching Delhi sun was enough for Hamilton to hope the event, if it takes off, is held in winter because otherwise the humidity might prove a roadblock.         
	But the couple of thousand who braved the scorching sun to catch a glimpse of the reigning world champion here on Saturday, would have returned home with a fair idea of what a true champion is all about.         
	The 24-year-old Formula One world champion did not drive a car but was asked to play a limited-over cricket match against a bunch of local club and Ranji cricketers.         
	Undaunted, Hamilton marched onto the pitch with a bat and asked: The last time I played cricket was in school and someone bowled underarm.         
	It took the Briton only a couple of overs to understand the nuances of the game. Just give me a couple of days to practice, I will come back and take you on he quipped.         
	As if to prove his point, Hamilton smacked a big six and kept the rival batsman on a tight leash when he bowled the only over of the day. Next time I play cricket, I will ask for a few tips from Kevin Pietersen since he asks me for tips on cars, he said.         
	When asked to comment on the proposed Indian Grand Prix in 2011, Hamilton made it clear that the hot and sultry weather could be a serious issue in hosting the meet. Is it always so hot here? Unbelievable. I hope they hold the Grand Prix here in winter, Hamilton said.         
	We lose up to four kgs after a race even though I lost one and half kg in the last race at Hungary. The humidity here is an issue and it would pose a serious challenge to the drivers. But at the same time, this is just my second visit to India and I can see for myself how excited the people here are about Formula One, Hamilton said.         
	The McLaren driver was confident that Force India would soon make their presence felt and score their maiden point.         
	Force India are a great team. They are developing their car for the past two-and-a-half years. I think they will do much better in the next race in Spain, said Hamilton.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brasa wants contract till London 2012
                                                     Brasa wants contract till London 2012
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Brasa                           
	New Delhi: Spaniard Jose Brasa, widely tipped to take over as the national coach, has informed the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) members that he wants a contract till the 2012 London Olympics.         
	Brasa, who made an impressive presentation to the ad hoc committee and met the IOA president Suresh Kalmadi on Friday, has categorically said that the fitness of the Indian players was the main area of concern.         
	Money is not the only criteria, Brasa later said. I have told the Indian officials that there are several other things which are needed to improve the standard of the game. In case I take up this job, I will need all those facilities.         
	While all the Indian officials were impressed by the veteran coachs knowledge of Indian hockey and grasp over technical matters, they were not sure whether the government would be able to meet his financial demands.         
	He has not made any specific demand so far, but we are keeping our fingers crossed. As it is, the government wants the foreign coach to have a contract till the 2010 Asian Games only, an official said.         
	Brasa, on his part, said he was yet to make any specific demand. I am only studying the programme of the Indian national team for the next two seasons. If I have to make a demand, I will do it accordingly, he said. Brasa will fly out of Delhi on Sunday.

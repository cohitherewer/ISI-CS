The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Saddlers Star for main event
                                                                                                               Saddlers Star for main event 
            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Trainer Bharath Singhs Saddlers Star, who failed as a favourite in her last outing, may be hard to beat in the 1,400m Schwarzenegger Cup on Wednesday. In her last outing in a 1,100m race, the Brave Act filly lost considerable ground at the start, yet she finished a good second to Foot Tapper. With extra 300m to traverse, Saddlers Star is expected to have the measure of trainer Imtiaz Saits filly, Bourbon Queen, who has been well penalised for her last victory.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Defending champions Mohun Bagan have been clubbed with city rivals Chirag United and Mumbai giants Mahindra United in the group B league of the Federation Cup, to be played in Guwahati and Silchar from December 21 to January 3.         
	As per the draw held at the Football House on Monday, the winners of the Guwahati leg of the qualifiers will be the fourth team in group B while the other Calcutta major, East Bengal, have been placed in group A along with JCT, Salgaocar and Viva Kerala.         
	The two teams will meet in the semi-finals if they top their groups.         
	Sources also said that Indias friendly against a top Asian team on December 12, at the Ambedkar Stadium, is unlikely to be played although the national camp would continue till the second week of next month.         
	Originally, the match was supposed to be played against Iraq. After the Iraq Football Association was banned by Fifa, we were looking for a new option.         
	There are some teams who are ready to play but we have to be careful while choosing our opponents, said a source.         
	A final decision will only be taken after consulting national coach Bob Houghton in Goa.         
	The AIFF, meanwhile, has show caused Dempo SC for not sending their players  Mahesh Gawli and Samir Naik  to the national camp. The club have been given till December 7 to submit their reply.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Two days after the All India Football Federation (AIFF) decided to replace Thailand with Palestine in the forthcoming Nehru Cup, there are reports that Palestine could actually be sending a club team for the six-nation tournament.         
	According to a report in a website on Sunday, Hilal Al Quds, a club from Jerusalem, who finished ninth in the West Bank Premier League 2008-09 , will be coming to India as the Palestine national team. The team had managed only nine wins in 21 games in the league last season.         
	As per the draw, India will take on Palestine on the opening day of the tournament on August 19.         
	The AIFF general secretary, Alberto Colaco said he was not aware of the development and would talk to the Fifa agent, who arranged the team and the Palestine football federation about the matter.         
	An official of the ONGC, the sponsors of the Nehru Cup, said his company has no idea about it.

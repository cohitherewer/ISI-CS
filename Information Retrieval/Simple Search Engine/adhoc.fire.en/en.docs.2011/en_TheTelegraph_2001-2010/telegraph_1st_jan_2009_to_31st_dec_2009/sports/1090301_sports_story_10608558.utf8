The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ishant likely to miss 1st ODI
                                                   Ishant likely to miss 1st ODI
                      
	Wellington: Indias pace sensation Ishant Sharma is likely to miss Tuesdays first ODI against New Zealand due to injury.         
	The lanky fast bowler had hurt his shoulder while fielding in the second Twenty20 International on Friday. A bruise was revealed in the MRI scan carried out on his shoulder on Saturady. The impact of falling on the ball is said to have aggravated an old injury.         
	The MRI scan has disclosed that there is a bruise. We will watch him over the next two days. But it is likely that Ishant may miss the first ODI against New Zealand, said administrative manager Niranjan Shah, who is accompanying the Indian side.         
	The five-match one-day series will begin from March 3 with a floodlit contest inNapier.         
	Meanwhile, New Zealand selector Dion Nash has warned the players to be careful of an Indian backlash in the forthcoming one-dayers.         
	India are on top of their game. They are a genuinely good side at the moment. It is about momentum. Stopping the momentum of the Indian side and getting them to think twice is one of the goals of the Black Caps, said Nash, who is part of New Zealands three-member national selection panel.

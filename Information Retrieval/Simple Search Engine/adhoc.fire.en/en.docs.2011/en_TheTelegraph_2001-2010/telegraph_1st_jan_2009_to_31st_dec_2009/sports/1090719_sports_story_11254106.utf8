The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clijsters for full-fledged comeback
                                                   Clijsters for full-fledged comeback
                      
	Washington: Kim Clijsters is married and a mom these days. Now she hopes to again become a year-round professional tennis player.         
	The former top-ranked woman is ending a two-year retirement next month with a three-tournament test run. After returning to the US Open for the first time since winning it in 2005, Clijsters will decide if a full-fledged return to the Womens Tennis Association Tour next season is feasible.         
	Ive been training like a professional, with my mindset to coming back as a full professional. Im just going to see after the US Open how the whole trip went and just see which things I have to adjust, Clijsters said on Friday. Because its a new experience for me, as well, travelling with a family and just being back on Tour and everything. Its going to be completely different than it has been when I was on tour for 10 or 12 years in the past.         
	The 26-year-old Belgian left tennis in May 2007 to start a family. She married American Brian Lynch that year, and their daughter, Jada, was born in February 2008.         
	Clijsters called what shes doing now starting back all over. I hardly played for two years.         
	She reached No. 1 in the singles and doubles rankings in August 2003, and won 34 career singles titles, including her Grand Slam at Flushing Meadows. She also was the runner-up at the four major tournaments. (AP)

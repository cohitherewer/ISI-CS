The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AIFF plan in limbo
                                                   AIFF plan in limbo
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Thursday failed to finalise the preparatory plans for Indias campaign in the 2011 Asian Cup and decided to refer the matter to acting president Praful Patel.         
	The AIFF executive committee, in its meeting last month, approved the Goal 2011 plan to select a group of 25 top footballers and reserve them exclusively for national duty till the Asian Cup in Doha in January 2011. The ambitious programme, sources said, would cost the federation close to Rs 40 crore.         
	The senior members of the federation, including three vice-presidents  Subrata Dutta, A.R. Khaleel and Ankur Dutta along with general secretary Alberto Colaco  who met at the AIFF house, discussed the budget and decided to convey it to Patel next month.         
	We are all for this proposal but the budget could be the biggest hurdle, said a source. Since the world is going through an economic recession, we are not too confident whether we would be able to garner funds from sponsors.         
	Most of the senior members are of the opinion that a lack of sponsors could be the stumbling block in the successful launching of the Goal 2011 project.         
	The AIFF could not even manage a sponsor for the Federation Cup this time. It would be a miracle if they succeed in raising Rs 40 crore from the sponsors, sources added.         
	Considerable time was spent in the meeting discussing the federations financial position.

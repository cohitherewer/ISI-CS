The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chelsea ready for Liverpool
                                                   Chelsea ready for Liverpool
                      
	London: Just in time to face title rivals Liverpool, Carlo Ancelotti says he has resolved Chelseas problems following a first loss of the season to Wigan and an arduous Champions League away win in Cyprus.         
	Thats just as well for Ancelotti, because it was Liverpools victory at Stamford Bridge last October that ended Chelseas 86-match unbeaten home record and sparked the slump that saw Luiz Felipe Scolaris tenure as manager prematurely curtailed.         
	When the team is not doing well we have to look and do an analysis, Ancelotti said Friday. We did this and resolved the problems. It is normal in football. On Sunday it is a test, but we are happy to meet Liverpool in this moment.         
	Ancelotti, who was hired after Scolaris interim replacement Guus Hiddink left, insists he is not feeling the pressure after the 1-3 loss at Wigan and the scrappy 1-0 victory at lowly APOEL Nicosia.         
	Owner Roman Abramovich was at the clubs training ground Friday to survey his players  and Ancelotti.         
	I dont think hes worried, Ancelotti said. I think hes happy because his team is at the top of the league and top of the Champions League group.         
	Chelsea off the top of the standings on goal difference enjoy a three-point lead over Liverpool.         
	The Reds have already lost twice in the league this season and are in need of a morale-boosting win Sunday after going down 0-2 at Fiorentina in the Champions League Wednesday.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Down 1-2 at half-time, East Bengal came back strongly after the change of ends to thrash Calcutta Port Trust 4-2 in a CFL Premier Division match at the Kalyani Stadium on Sunday. Under-19 player Budiram Tudu, who scored the first and fourth goal for the red and gold brigade, was awarded the Man of the Match prize.         
	Despite scoring an early goal, in the 13th minute, by Tudu and playing a fine attacking game, East Bengal went 1-2 down.         
	Port Trusts foreign recruit Henry, drew level in the 36th minute after a Harmanjot Singh Khabra handball awarded them a penalty. Nine minutes later Henry was in the thick of action again. East Bengal goalkeeper Avijit Ghosh tried to palm away a Henry header and made a mess of things. Tha ball nestled into the net as the red and gold brigade watched helplessly.         
	Fifty-eight minutes into match Abel Hammond restored parity from a free-kick. Harmanjot headed in the third goal off an Alvito DCunha freekick in the 71st minute. Just two minutes later, Tudu capitalised on a loose ball to seal the deal for East Bengal.         
	In the post-match conference, East Bengal coach Phillippe de Ridder was a pleased man.         
	The players showed character and the will to fight. And we were a different team in the second half, the Belgian said.

                                                     Paes, Dlouhy crash out
                  Rafael Nadal                     
	Barcelona: Leander Paes and partner Lukas Dlouhy made second-round exit from the Barcelona Open after losing a hard-fought match to Simon Aspelin of Sweden and Wesley Moodie of South Africa.         
	The third-seeded Indo-Czech duo lost 6-7 (5), 6-7 (3) to their unseeded opponents in the encounter lasting one hour and 41 minutes.         
	Paes and Dlouhy saved both breakpoints in the first set but eventually lost in the tie-breaker.         
	In the second set too they saved three breakpoints out of four and broke their rivals once, but surrendered in the tie-breaker to crash out of the tournament.         
	In singles, world No. 1 Rafael Nadal began his campaign for a fifth successive Barcelona Open title with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over Portuguese qualifier Frederico Gil on Wednesday.         
	The Spanish top seed broke Gils serve in the third game of the first set and coasted into the last 16 with three more breaks on the clay in the Catalan capital.         
	Nadal will play either 13th-seeded Frenchman Richard Gasquet or Christophe Rochus of Belgium for a place in the quarter final.         
	Third seed Nikolay Davydenko also went through on Wednesday when he beat Frenchman Arnaud Clement 7-6, 6-2.         
	Tommy Robredo, the Spanish sixth seed, beat 2004 French Open champion Gaston Gaudio of Argentina 7-6, 6-1 and Gaudios compatriot David Nalbandian defeated Russian Igor Kunitsyn 7-5, 6-4 in their second-round matches.

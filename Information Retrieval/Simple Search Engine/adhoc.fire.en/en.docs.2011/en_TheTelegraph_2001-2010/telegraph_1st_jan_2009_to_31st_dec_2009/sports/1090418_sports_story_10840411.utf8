                                                   Ravi Shastri on ICC panel
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former India captain Ravi Shastri will replace Michael Holding as the media representative on the ICC cricket committee, the world governing body announced Friday.         
	The decision was taken at the ICCs executive committee meeting. Holding, a former West Indies fast bowler, had resigned last year.         
	Welcoming Shastris appointment, ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said the former India captain, now a commentator, would prove an asset to the committee.         
	I am delighted that we have a person of the experience of Ravi joining us on the cricket committee.         
	He was an outstanding player, is a highly-respected broadcaster and is also someone who is hugely respected by many, many people within the game. He will be a great asset to the committee, Lorgat said in a statement.         
	The next meeting of the ICC cricket committee, chaired by former West Indies captain Clive Lloyd, will take place in London on May 11 and 12.         
	It will include an assessment of the recent trial of the umpire decision review system with a view to making a recommendation to the ICC chief executives committee on its future employment or otherwise, the statement added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murray needs to have faith: Sanchez
                                                   Murray needs to have faith: Sanchez
                      
	Madrid: Andy Murray has what it takes to go far at the French Open but he needs to be more patient and have faith in his talent, according to the head of the Spanish academy where he learned to play on clay as a teenager.         
	The British world No. 3, now 22, went to train at the Sanchez-Casal Academy in Barcelona at the age of 15 to try to improve his craft on the red dust, which remains his weakest surface and one on which he has never won a tour singles title.         
	If he suffers and believes in his ability he could get to the final rounds but for that he needs to believe in his head, his heart and his legs, Emilio Sanchez Vicario, the academys co-founder and a twice doubles champion at Roland Garros, said in an interview.         
	He has to be more patient, use his head more to be more consistent and make use of his talent to force the game more effectively, added Sanchez Vicario, the brother of former French Open singles champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario.         
	He has to use his physical prowess, not just the strength he has built up but also be more resistant. That is key on clay. He has it but I am not sure if he knows how to show it or if he even knows he has it.         
	This year has been Murrays best clay season so far and he reached the semi-finals at the Monte Carlo Masters and the quarter finals in Madrid before falling to French Open champion Rafael Nadal and Juan Martin Del Potro respectively.

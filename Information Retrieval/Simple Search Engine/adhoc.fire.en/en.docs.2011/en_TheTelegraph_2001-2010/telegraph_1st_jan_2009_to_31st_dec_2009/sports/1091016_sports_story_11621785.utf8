The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tyagi: I want to bowl   like Zaheer
                                                     Tyagi: I want to bowl   like Zaheer
                  Sudeep Tyagi                           
	Ghaziabad: Rookie Uttar Pradesh pacer Sudeep Tyagi, the lone new face in the Indian squad for the first two ODIs against Australia, considers pacer Zaheer Khan as his role model and said he would try to justify the selectors faith in him if he gets an opportunity to play.         
	Zaheer is my role model and I want to perform like him on the big stage. I want to follow in his footsteps, an elated Tyagi said.         
	Every cricketer has a dream of playing for the country and I have no words to express my feelings. I will wait for the moment when I will be part of the Indian teams dressing room, where cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar would also be present, 22-year-old Tyagi said.         
	Tyagi gave his coach Jitendra Vatsa the credit for his selection to the national side.           (PTI)

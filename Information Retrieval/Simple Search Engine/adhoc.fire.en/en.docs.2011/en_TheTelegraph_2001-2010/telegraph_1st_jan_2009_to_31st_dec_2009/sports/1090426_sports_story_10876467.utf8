The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Duminy looks up to Tendulkar
                                                   Duminy looks up to Tendulkar
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Durban: South African batting sensation J.P. Duminy is in awe of master blaster Sachin Tendulkar and the youngster is looking to utilise his Indian Premier League (IPL) stint to gather cricket knowledge from his illustrious teammate in the Mumbai Indians side.         
	Duminy admitted that he is feeling the heat of playing alongside superstars like Tendulkar and Sanath Jayasuriya in the Mumbai Indians team but said that he is eager to do well in the on-going Twenty20 extravaganza in South Africa.         
	I am looking forward to talk to him (Tendulkar) about my game. He is a legend. I would be lying if I say I am not in awe of him. He is a great guy and very approachable, he said.         
	I expect to play well. I am well experienced with the local conditions and will have to play a pivotal role. But I dont want to put pressure on myself. I look at it as just another game of cricket.         
	The 25-year-old added that Tendulkars vast experience and knowledge about the game makes him the anchor of the Mumbai Indians side.         
	The strategy is that Sachin Tendulkar will play the anchor role and the other guys will play around him. He is an experienced campaigner and reads the game very well, said Duminy, who considers his national teammate Herschelle Gibbs as his idol, on the official IPL website.         
	Impressed with Duminys talent during South Africas historic Test and one-day series victory in Australia earlier this year, the Tendulkar-led Mumbai Indians bagged the youngster for a huge $950,000 and the South African said that he is enjoying every bit of the limelight.         
	It has been an amazing experience for me. It has been just a few days and I am enjoying every bit of it. We are coming together as a team. The guys are looking forward to the next game.         
	He added that the high-profile IPL will be an ideal platform for the players to prepare for the ICC World Twenty20 in England in June.         
	It has been good. I played well in T20s in Australia. Playing in the IPL will be good preparation for the coming ICC World Twenty20, Duminy said.         
	Duminy also feels that having Shaun Pollock and Jonty Rhodes in the Mumbai Indians think-tank will boost the teams title aspirations in the IPL this season.         
	We are fortunate to have Shaun Pollock and Jonty Rhodes in the coaching staff. They have played the game at the highest level and have a good understanding about what it takes to be a champion team, he said.

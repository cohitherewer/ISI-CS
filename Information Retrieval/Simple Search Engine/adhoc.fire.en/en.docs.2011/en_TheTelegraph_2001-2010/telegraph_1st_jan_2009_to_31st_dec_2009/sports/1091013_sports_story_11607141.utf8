                                                   Eagles brace for Sharks attack
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: After a comprehensive defeat in their opening matches against the New South Wales Blues, the Sussex Sharks and the Diamond Eagles will meet each other Tuesday to decide the second qualifier from Group B in the Champions League T20.         
	Neither of the two teams could do much against the Blues and it is difficult to say who has the edge in the deciding tie.         
	Sussex would evince more interest as the English side have Indias Piyush Chawla. Hoping to make a comeback to the national team, Chawla bowled reasonably well against the Blues but came a cropper with the bat after he was promoted up the order. Sussex also have Pakistani pacer Yasir Arafat.         
	Skipper Boeta Dippenaar is the only known name in the Diamond Eagles but the former South Africa Test player could hardly make an impact in the first match.

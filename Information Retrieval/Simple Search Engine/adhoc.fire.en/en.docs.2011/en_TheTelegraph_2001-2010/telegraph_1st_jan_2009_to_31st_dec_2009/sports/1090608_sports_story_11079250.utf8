The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Button widens gap at top
                                                   Button widens gap at top
                            
	Istanbul: Jenson Button ran away with the Turkish Grand Prix on Sunday to stretch his overall Formula One lead to 26 points with a sparkling sixth victory in seven races.         
	Australian Mark Webber finished runner-up for Red Bull, taking the chequered flag 6.7 seconds behind the Briton to equal his best-ever finish, with 21-year-old German teammate Sebastian Vettel third, after starting at pole position.         
	Button stretched his championship lead over Brazilian teammate Rubens Barrichello, who failed to finish after a starting glitch left him fighting way down the field, to 26 points with 10 races remaining. The Briton has 61 points, Barrichello 35 and Vettel 29.         
	You have built me a monster of a car, you guys are absolute legends, Button yelled over the team radio, his voice wavering with emotion, after the white and lime car crossed the finish line.         
	Buttons seventh career win, and fourth in a row, made him the first driver to win in Turkey without starting at pole since the race made its debut at the Istanbul Park circuit in 2005. It also ended Ferraris Felipe Massas run of three wins in a row here.         
	Today the car was the best it felt all year. Today it was immense, it really was, added Button. I wish I could have had all the guys up on the podium with me.         
	Vettel, who made three stops to Webbers two but failed to make the strategy work for him, made a mistake when he hit the kerb into turn nine and went wide at turn 10 on the opening lap, allowing Button to slip past. Vettel said he had been well beaten. Jenson was just too quick today, I dont think I would have held him anyway, he said.         
	In what is shaping up to be the most dominant season by a driver since the championship started in 1950, 29-year-old Button also became the first Briton to win four successive races in a single year since Nigel Mansell in 1992.         
	Only five other British drivers, all of them champions, have won six times in a season and that tally does not include current champion Lewis Hamilton. The 24-year-old McLaren driver, wrestling with an uncompetitive car, finished 13th  80.4 seconds behind Button  unlapped but still out of the points for the third race in succession.         
	Italian Jarno Trulli was fourth for Toyota, a strong comeback after that teams dismal Monaco weekend, with Germanys Nico Rosberg fifth for Williams. Massa was sixth while Polands Robert Kubica, a title challenger last season, scored his first points of the year for BMW-Sauber in seventh place. Germanys Timo Glock took the final point for Toyota.         
	On a brilliantly sunny afternoon at Istanbul Park, with temperatures in the 30s, the race was short on incident with only Barrichello and Force Indias Italian Giancarlo Fisichella retiring. The biggest disappointment was the lack of spectators with fans easily outnumbered by the empty seats.         
	Force Indias Adrain Sutil finished at the 17th position. Sutil failed to put up an impressive show and crossed the chequered flag a lap down at 17th place. Fisichella had to quit just after four laps with a mechanical problem.

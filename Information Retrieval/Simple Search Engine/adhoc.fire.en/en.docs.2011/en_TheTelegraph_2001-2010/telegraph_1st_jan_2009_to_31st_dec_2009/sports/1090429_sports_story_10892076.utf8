            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Durban: With the franchise languishing second from the bottom, the Kolkata Knight Riders team management has initiated moves to ensure that Chris Gayle, the West Indies captain, can play the May 3 match too.         
	As of now, hes to leave after the May 1 game, against the Mumbai Indians, in East London.         
	Were trying to work things out... Weve got our fingers crossed, a well-placed source told The Telegraph on Tuesday.         
	Unless theres a change, Gayle has to report in London on May 2. The West Indies-England Test series begins on May 6.

	Kaohsiung: Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi quelled a late challenge from Chinese Taipeis Tsung-Hua Yang and Chu-Huan Yi to carve out a hard fought 6-4, 7-6, 6-7 (2), 6-2 win in the doubles rubber of the second round Davis Cup tie to hand India a 2-1 advantage, here on Saturday.         
	Paes and Bhupathi were cruising along comfortably after winning the first two sets but the Taipei pair surprised them with their never-say-die spirit as they upset the multiple Grand Slam winners in the third set.         
	The Indians saved six points and stretched the third set to tie-breaker but both Paes and Bhupathi double faulted at crucial junctures to lose the set.         
	The Indian pair were down 1-5 as the immensely talented Chinese Taipei players broke them twice  third and fifth games  but the visitors won five games on the trot to make it 6-5.         
	Stunned by the brilliant fightback, the Indian pair then stepped on the accelerator and rode a double break to win the fourth set and seal the issue. After this victory, India need to win one of the two reverse singles on Sunday to advance to the third round of the Asia/ Oceania Group I competition.         
	The Indian pair began in style by breaking their rivals in the very first game of the match but were soon facing breakpoints in the sixth game as Bhupathi struggled with his first serve. A double fault and a forehand error by Bhupathi handed two breakpoints to the host players but the Indian, who in exasperation hit the ball with his foot, bettered his effort and ensured India do not lose the advantage.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Batting worries Pakistan
                                                     Batting worries Pakistan
                  Muttiah Muralidharan during a practice session in Dambulla on Friday                     
	Dambulla: The failure of the top order will be Pakistans main concern when they take on hosts Sri Lanka in the second one-dayer here on Saturday.         
	The first one-dayer on Thursday wasnt as one-sided as it was turning out to be at one stage. But that was because the Pak lower order fought commendably with only a couple of wickets in hand.         
	It was, however, not enough to erase an inept performance by the top order.         
	Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam stated after the match that the pitch was not to blame; his team lost it in the field when they failed to restrict the Sri Lankans below 200.         
	The bowlers struggled to contain a rampaging Muttiah Muralidharan in the third Powerplay. Muralis innings gave the Lankans the psychological advantage which helped them when they fielded.         
	Intikhab did not blame the defeat on bad batting.         
	Nevertheless, the top orders vulnerability against quality swing bowling was exposed by Sri Lankas penetrative new-ball attack.         
	In the four matches on this tour so far (three Tests and the first ODI), Pakistan are yet to register a win, despite some closely-fought contests. Pakistan need to win Saturday if they are to avoid being in a situation where they have to win all the remaining games to win the series.         
	Sri Lanka, too, did not bat as well as they would have liked, but they have fewer concerns overall, compared to their opponents.         
	Kumar Sangakkara was not at all happy with the way his bowlers lost the plot towards the end of Pakistans chase. Death bowling is something the home team need to do improve upon.

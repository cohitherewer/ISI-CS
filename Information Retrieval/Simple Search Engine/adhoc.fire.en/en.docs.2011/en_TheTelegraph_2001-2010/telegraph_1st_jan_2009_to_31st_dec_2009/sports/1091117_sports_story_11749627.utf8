  - Final call on injured Bengal captain today for Ranji tie vs Karnataka         A STAFF REPORTER                Laxmi Ratan Shukla (top) and Deep Dasgupta                                        
	Calcutta: They started off with a bang against Maharashtra but lost the initiative against Baroda with some irresponsible performances. Now, the Bengal team are losing it in terms of planning too.         
	Those thinking that the Bengal team management will be busy devising strategies to counter the Karnataka pace trio of R. Vinay Kumar, Sreesanth Aravind and Abhimanyu Mithun on a bouncy wicket, are horribly wrong.         
	Lack of planning and foresight were evident in the team managements handling of skipper Laxmi Ratan Shuklas injury on the eve of their third Ranji Trophy Super League (Group B) tie which starts Tuesday at the Gangotri ground in Mysore.         
	Such is the situation that even 12 hours before the commencement of the match, neither the CAB office-bearers nor the selectors could confirm who was to lead the side in case Shukla failed to pass the fitness test on Tuesday morning.         
	When asked why the selection committee has failed to name a stand-in skipper knowing that Shukla is having fitness problems, chairman of selectors Sambaran Banerjees answer was far from convincing.         
	We will decide on the captain only if Shukla fails the fitness test, Banerjee said.         
	When asked whether it is fair on the replacement who will get no time to prepare, he said: We have a few options in mind. We will intimate them as and when the time comes.         
	According to sources, Deep Dasgupta is a strong contender in case Shukla doesnt play. Shukla, who sustained a quadriceps strain while bowling during Barodas second innings, was advised three days rest.         
	Saurasish Lahiri and Dasgupta took turns leading the side on the final day. Due to some bizarre convention, CAB does not name a vice-captain and that has made the situation dicey.         
	As for Shukla, the Bengal captain couldnt bowl during nets on Monday morning due to considerable pain.         
	The pain is still there. I am having a problem while running. Even while batting against the spinners, I am not very comfortable coming down the wicket... I know how important three points are. I will be undergoing a fitness test tomorrow, a dejected skipper said when contacted in Mysore.         
	There is a high possibility that Shukla may play purely as a batsman. If that happens, Bengal will miss a third seamer on a bouncy wicket and in overcast conditions.         
	This is not exactly a green top. It is hard and will have good carry. The ball would definitely do something off the pitch, Shukla said.         
	The fates of Rohan Banerjee and Sayan Sekhar Mondal will depend on the skippers fitness.         
	If Shukla plays, but purely as a batsman, Sayan is likely to get a look in as an extra seamer.         
	If Shukla is able to bowl then Rohan is likely to open with Arindam Das. Dasgupta will come in at No.7.         
	The positive news for Bengal is the return of premier batsman Manoj Tiwary along with keeper Wriddhiman Saha and pacer Ashok Dinda.         
	The Karnataka side, who are top of group B with eight points, miss skipper Rahul Dravid on national duty.         
	But with in-form Manish Pandey and captain Robin Uthappa in their ranks, the team can aim at putting up a big score.         
	However, it is their seam attack that can pose quite a few problems for a Bengal batting line-up which has flattered to deceive on most occasions.

                                                     Shukla axed, Das to lead East
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Wriddhiman Saha                           
	Guwahati: Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla failed to find a place in the 16-member East Zone squad for the Duleep Trophy.         
	Former India opener Shiv Sundar Das has been named captain of the side which has five players from Bengal, four from Orissa, three each from Assam and Tripura and one from Jharkhand.         
	Teenaged Assam pacer Krishna Das has been named along with seasoned counterparts from Bengal, Ranadeb Bose and Ashok Dinda, to share the new ball.         
	Assam captain Rashmi Ranjan Parida has been named the vice-captain of the team that has two wicketkeepers in Wriddhiman Saha of Bengal and Orissas Haladhar Das.         
	The other Bengal players in the team are Manoj Tiwary and Dibyendu Chakraborty.         
	The Assam Cricket Association hosted the first zonal selection meeting on Saturday after it was chosen the East Zone convenor on September 27 last year. The meeting, chaired by national selector Raja Venkat as chairman, was attended by Sambaran Banerjee (Bengal), Nagesh Singh (Assam), Jodh Singh (Jharkhand), R. Paul (Tripura) and Daniel Rout (Orissa).         
	On Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Venkat said: We have sought his availability but is yet to get any response. We also failed to establish contact with him.         
	Bengal coach Utpal Chatterjee, who has reportedly been under the CAB scanner following a tiff with state chief selector Sambaran, has been named East Zones coach. Assam chief selector Nagesh Singh is the manager and S. Srinivasan of Bengal the physio. Jeeth Deviah of Assam is the trainer.         
	The basic criterion of selection was performance in the Ranji Trophy. The selection was unanimous, said Venkat.         
	We have also named three youngsters  Krishna Das, Dibyendu and Haladhar Das  keeping in view their potential, he added.         
	Bengal batsman Dibyendus selection is a surprise. The 26-year-old has played only three Ranji Trophy matches scoring 244 runs, including three half centuries in five innings.         
	According to Venkat, Shukla was not considered due to poor performance in the Ranji Trophy.         
	Apart from Das and Parida, left-arm spinner Anand Katti is the third Assam player to be picked.         
	East will play West in their first match at the CCI in Mumbai from January 29. The winners will qualify for the final from February 5 to 9.         
	The East Zone players will have a two-day camp at the Barabati Stadium in Cuttack from January 24 and leave for Mumbai on January 27.         
	The squad         
	Shiv Sundar Das (captain), Rashmi Ranjan Parida (vice-captain), Niranjan Behera, Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Manoj Tiwary, Saurabh Tiwary, Nishit Shetty, Ashok Dinda, Ranadeb Bose, Basanth Mohanty, Jayanta Debnath, Anand Katti, Tushar Saha, Krishna Das, Dibyendu Chakraborty and Haladhar Das.         
	Stand-byes: Ishant Jaggi, Sujit Kumar Rai, Sourav Sarkar and Swarupam Purkayastha.

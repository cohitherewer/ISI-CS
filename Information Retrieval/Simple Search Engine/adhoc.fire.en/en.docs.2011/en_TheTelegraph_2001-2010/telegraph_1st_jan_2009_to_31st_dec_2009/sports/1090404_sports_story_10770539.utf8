The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fisichella crashes, Ferrari sizzle
                                                     Fisichella crashes, Ferrari sizzle

	Sepang: Giancarlo Fisichellas spectacular sideswiping of the barrier left his car with suspension damages but not before the Italian and his Force India teammate Adrian Sutil had recorded times just over a second from the fastest lap in the free Malaysian Grand Prix practice sessions here on Friday.         
	Fisichellas 1:37.025 seconds in the first session was good enough for 12th place among 20 drivers while Sutil (1:37.241) came 15th.         
	In the second session, the order changed with Sutil improving his timing to 1:36.875 to be 16th, while Fisichella (1:37.432) dropped to 19th.         
	Kimi Raikkonen led a Ferrari one-two in the practice on Friday, with the world champions returning to speed after a difficult start to the season.         
	Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion who won at Sepang last year, fired in a quickest lap of 1:35.707 in the afternoon to end Nico Rosbergs four-session run at the top of the timesheets. Brazilian teammate Felipe Massa was second fastest in 1:35.832.         
	Brawn GPs Rubens Barrichello was given a five-place grid penalty after the team made a gearbox change in his car following Fridays practice sessions.         
	Barrichello was sixth fastest in the afternoon session and fourth fastest in the morning session.         
	Formula One rules dictate that a gearbox must last four race meetings, and any premature change results in a five-place penalty on the starting grid.         
	Barrichellos teammate Jenson Button was seventh in the afternoon session and third in the morning, with the drivers locking the tires and brakes regularly around the Sepang track.         
	McLarens world champion Lewis Hamilton was the seventh quickest in the morning, a day after he was stripped of third place from Australia for deliberately misleading stewards at the post-race enquiry.         
	To compound his problems, the 24-year-old was also fined 2,100 euros ($2,802) for speeding in the pit lane on two separate occasions. Teammate Heikki Kovalainen was ninth in the afternoon.         
	Neither Ferrari driver scored a point in the Australian season-opener in the Italian teams worst start to a season since 1992.         
	We had felt the situation here could be different to Melbourne but it is still too early to say where we are, up against the opposition, said Raikkonen.         
	Red Bulls Sebastian Vettel was third fastest in the afternoon, ahead of Rosberg.         
	The only blip in Force Indias programme came in the second session when Fisichella put a wheel on the grass at turn 11 and went into the gravel trap and the barriers.         
	His VJM02 sustained suspension damage in the impact but will be repaired overnight in time for Saturdays final practice session and qualifying.         
	Its a shame about the accident in the afternoon. I just went a little bit wide as there was some graining on the tyres and I lost control of the car. It was just unlucky to go onto the gravel and into the barriers, Fisichella later said.         
	We are still trying to find the best compromise under braking as there is front locking and poor grip and traction. So we have to work a lot to make the balance work for us. Over the longer runs it doesnt look too bad however, Fisichella added.

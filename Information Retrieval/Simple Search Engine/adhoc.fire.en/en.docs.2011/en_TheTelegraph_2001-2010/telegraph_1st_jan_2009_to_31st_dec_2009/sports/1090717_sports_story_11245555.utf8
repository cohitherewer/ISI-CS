The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Retirement circus could distract the hosts: Ricky
                                                   Retirement circus could distract the hosts: Ricky
            Simon Briggs                      
	Ricky Ponting has warned that Andrew Flintoffs final appearances in Test cricket could become a bit of a circus, distracting the hosts from the basics of the game.         
	If he plays to the end of the series, Im sure there will be some outside distractions for the England team to deal with, said Ponting.         
	Whether Andrew wanted it that way or not, Ive been in teams where it has happened in Australia, and it can be distracting, not only for the person involved but for the captain as well.         
	Knowing the stature he has in the game in England, I can see it turning into a farewell tour.         
	You can see that the fans here are very passionate about watching Andrew play, so if they know this is his last chance to play here  and then at Edgbaston and Headingley and so on  Im sure there will be a bit of a circus around him.         
	Steve Waugh announced he was about to play his final season of international cricket in 2003-04. As he serenaded his way around Australia, his goodbyes rather overshadowed the Test series against India, which his team were lucky to draw 1-1.         
	Maybe there is a comparison there, Ponting said. They are similar sort of figures in either side and in either country.         
	We talked long and hard about making sure that it didnt turn into a farewell tour for Steve, but as hard as we tried, and as hard as he tried not to make it that way, it did become very heavily focused on everything that he did.

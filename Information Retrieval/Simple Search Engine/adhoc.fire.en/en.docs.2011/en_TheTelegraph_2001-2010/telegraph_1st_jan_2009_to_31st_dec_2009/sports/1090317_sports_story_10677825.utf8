                                                   Jeev soars to No. 29
                      
	New Delhi: Jeev Milkha Singh continues to soar high, reaching a career-best 29th following his fourth-place finish in the WGC-CA Championship with compatriot Jyoti Randhawa giving him company in the top-100 list of official world golf rankings issued Monday.         
	Jeev had a fairytale campaign in the WGC-CA Championship where a sensational opening round of seven-under 65 put him in the four-way lead.         
	The seasoned Indian eventually finished fourth at the Blue Monster in Doral to collect a cheque of $360,000 and jump seven places from last weeks 36th position.         
	Randhawa, who broke into the top 100 following his triumph in the Thailand Open, is placed 96th in the chart.         
	US-based Arjun Atwal is way down at 237th, while last years Indian Masters winner SSP Chowrasia is placed 331st.         
	Meanwhile, Phil Mickelsons second title of the year helped him move up one place to world No. 2 and to within 0.52 average points of No. 1 Tiger Woods.         
	Mickelsons three under round of 69 allowed him to finish the tournament on 19 under and claim his second tour win of the year and his first victory at a world golf championship event.

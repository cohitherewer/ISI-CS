The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Branco features in Karim plan
                                                     Branco features in Karim plan
            A STAFF REPORTER            Karim                           
	Calcutta: Coach Karim Bencharifa may give Branco Cardozo a look in against Churchill Brothers in the crucial away tie for Mohun Bagan on March 4.         
	This possibility owes much to the unavailability of Bhaichung Bhutia who will miss the match on a double yellow.         
	Branco, who last played in the initial phase of the I-League before getting injured is, according to Bencharfia, fit and raring to go. I havent decided whether he will get a start, but he is definitely in my scheme of things, Bencharifa said Wednesday.         
	Bencharifa said he is yet to decide whether he will go with a lone striker in Jose Ramirez Barreto on March 4. We have time. We may try out a five-man midfield formation and see how the boys are reacting to it, Bencharifa said.         
	Bencharifa, though, reiterated that Sundays loss would not have any bearing on Bagans title hopes. But he was yet to come to terms with Bhaichungs yellow card.         
	It was a ridiculous decision. I saw the replay and Bhaichungs marker (Mehrajuddin Wadoo) clearly made contact with him. And the referee (Dinesh Nair) penalises Bhaichung for simulation, he said. Bhaichung skipped practice on Wednesday as he reached the city from Mumbai late on Tuesday.         
	Meanwhile, an East Bengal supporter gave Rs 1 lakh to the players as reward for Sundays win.

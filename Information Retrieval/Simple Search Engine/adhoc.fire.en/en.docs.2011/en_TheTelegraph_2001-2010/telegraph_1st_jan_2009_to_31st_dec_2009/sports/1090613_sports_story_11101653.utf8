The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I have had my time at United, says Ronaldo
                                                     I have had my time at United, says Ronaldo
            Mark Ogden    
	Cristiano Ronaldo has labelled his 80m transfer to Real Madrid as historic after admitting that his time is up at Manchester United.         
	Ronaldo, 24, is set to seal a world record move to the Bernabeu following Sir Alex Fergusons decision to accept Reals offer for the Portuguese winger. The deal ends Reals two-year pursuit of Ronaldo, who learned of Uniteds acceptance of the bid while in Los Angeles, where he is currently on holiday.         
	Ronaldo said: Its flattering when two of the top teams in the world want you to play for them, but I have had my time at Manchester United. Now I can look forward to Real Madrid and a new stage in my career. I learned about the deal here in Los Angeles and have heard from my people that Manchester United have accepted. I am on vacation and will remain in Los Angeles for a bit more, but the deal is historic. 80 million is quite a sum of money.         
	Real are ready to send a medical team to Los Angeles to assess Ronaldos fitness following his withdrawal from Portugals squad for the midweek friendly against Estonia due to a suspected hernia problem. But the player insists that he will be fit to start pre-season training with his new club after ruling out the need for surgery.         
	Ronaldo said: I have been told that Madrid want to have a medical team look at me as expected, but I do not require a surgery. The hernia is nothing to worry about.         
	Meanwhile, Brazilian playmaker Kaka, who has relinquished his crown as the worlds most expensive footballer to Ronaldo, said: I rejoice in the signing of Cristiano, but I do not want to talk any more about this subject because I am here (in South Africa) with the Selecao (Brazils national team) and we are only thinking about winning the Confederations Cup. But theres no doubt that Cristiano is one of the best players in the world and he will help Real Madrid fight for every title next season.         
	Ronaldos departure from Manchester United leaves manager Sir Alex Ferguson with a huge hole to fill, but Portuguese winger Nani believes he can replace Ronaldo.         
	Nani said: Ronaldo was a very important player for us but now my opportunity has come. The time has come (for Manchester United) to put their trust in me. Its a fantastic fee and it puts a new value on Ronaldo. We are talking about an excellent player, so I think it (the fee) is fair. He deserves everything that has happened to him considering what he has accomplished in recent years. Real Madrid is a great club and I wish him luck.

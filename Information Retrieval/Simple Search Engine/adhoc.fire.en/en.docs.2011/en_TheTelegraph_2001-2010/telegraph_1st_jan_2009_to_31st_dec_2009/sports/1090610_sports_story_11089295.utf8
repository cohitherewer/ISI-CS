The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Old foes to spar for final berth
                                                     Old foes to spar for final berth
            ANSHUMAN ROY            Lalawmpuiya                           
	Chennai: A known devil is better than an unknown one. On the eve of their Santosh Trophy semi-final clash at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, here on Wednesday, the mood in the Bengal and Services camps is somewhat along these lines. Oh, we know them very well. Like the back of our hands, is the common refrain.         
	In the lead up to the Santosh Trophy, Wednesdays rivals played a couple of practice matches in Calcutta and the honours were shared. If Bengal won the first match 2-0, Services came back to win 3-2 in the second match.         
	But then, playing a practice match and crossing swords in the semi-final are completely different things. The expectations and the pressure that comes with it are such that even the coolest ones panic. Particularly for the Bengal players for whom the pressure of delivering seems too much too handle.         
	Bengal in fact are getting worked up by that fact that they were trounced by Services in last years semi-final. One S. Raleng scored a hattrick as Services won 4-1. The team is pumped up to exact revenge. In fact, during those practice matches, I felt that our boys were taking it a bit too seriously. A 4-1 loss for Bengal is too humiliating, Nandy said at the team hotel on Tuesday.         
	Bengal must be relieved that last years hattrick man has not been in his best form in the ongoing Santosh Trophy.         
	If Services are looking for an out-of-form match winner to regain his touch, Bengal are pinning their hopes on comeback man P.C. Lalawmpuiya to deliver once again. He has been superb in this tournament. He has promised me another goal in the semis, said captain Habibur Rehman Mondal.         
	Kick off: 5.30 p.m.

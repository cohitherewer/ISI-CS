The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sri Lanka maul Pakistan to clinch series 2-1
                                                     Sri Lanka maul Pakistan to clinch series 2-1
                  Tillekeratne Dilshan celebrates his hundred on Saturday                     
	Lahore: Sri Lanka inflicted on Pakistan their heaviest defeat in a limited-overs international on Saturday, winning the final game by 234 runs to clinch the series 2-1.         
	Tillekeratne Dilshans unbeaten 137 off 139 balls took Sri Lanka to 309/5 before Nuwan Kulasekera claimed 3/17 and Thilan Thushara 3/33 to skittle Pakistan in just 22.5 overs for their fourth-lowest total of 75.         
	Pakistans previous biggest defeat  in terms of runs  was a 224-run loss to Australia in 2002 at Nairobi, Kenya.         
	Sri Lanka were aided by Kumar Sangakkaras 50 and Sanath Jayasuriyas 45 at the Gaddafi Stadium, with Umar Gul taking 3/45 and Sohail Khan 1/52 for Pakistan.         
	Pakistan slumped to 18/5 in the ninth over before Gul hit 27 to save the team from recording their lowest total.         
	Sri Lanka off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan became only the second bowler after former Pakistan quick Wasim Akram (502) to have taken 500 ODI wickets, returning figures of 2/2.         
	Murali sounded a warning to India, their next opponents. India are one of the best sides in the world and I am looking forward to playing against them and take revenge as the last time they beat us in the one-day series, Murali said.         
	Pakistan won the first match in Karachi by eight wickets before Sri Lanka levelled the series by winning the second by 129 runs.         
	Pakistans decision to change their batting lineup flopped badly with opening bowlers Thushara and Kulasekera combining to effectively finish the match as a contest by the ninth over.         
	Thushara had Kamran Akmal on 9 and Younis Khan on 4 out leg before wicket, while Misbah-ul-Haq edged a ball to be caught behind for 0.         
	In between these wickets, Kulasekera removed Salman Butt for 0 and Khurram Manzoor, who was brilliantly caught for 3 by a diving Fervez Mahroof at square leg.         
	The hard-hitting Shahid Afridi lasted only three deliveries before leaving a delivery from Kulasekera that bowled him for 0.         
	Earlier, Dilshan had only one blemish in an otherwise superb century when Butt dropped a hard chance at point early in the innings after Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene won the toss.

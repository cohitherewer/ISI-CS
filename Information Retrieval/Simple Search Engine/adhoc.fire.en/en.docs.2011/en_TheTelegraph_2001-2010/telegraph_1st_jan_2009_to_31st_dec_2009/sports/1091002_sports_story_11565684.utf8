The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The world T20 show was more disappointing, says Dhoni
                                                   The world T20 show was more disappointing, says Dhoni
  - Frankly, its difficult for me to decide how bad the tournament was for us       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Johannesburg: Strangely, for a losing captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni couldnt take a call on just how badly his team had performed in the Champions Trophy.         
	Frankly, its difficult for me to decide how bad the tournament was for us... We lost one match, one got washed out and we won one... We had one off-game (against Pakistan)... Our World T20 performance was more disappointing, Dhoni said, after the inconsequential win against the West Indies, late on Wednesday.         
	As in the World T20, in June, Team India failed to make the semi-final.         
	At the very least, then, one wouldve expected the captain to admit that his men had played poorly in successive ICC-run events, which provide the biggest platform to showcase talent and character.         
	In fact, even the win against the West Indies, the worst team in this edition of the Champions Trophy, was so laboured: The target (130) being achieved as late as the 33rd over, for the loss of three wickets.         
	Dhoni, of course, will be returning home with the wicket of Travis Dowlin. But thats hardly going to be any consolation for a captain who recently took India to the No.1 spot in the ICCs ODI rankings.         
	I wont be reflecting on anything over the next few days... Ill be taking a break...Yes, we made mistakes in this tournament  the bowlers gave too much width and more effort had to be put while fielding... Things cant change overnight... We need a seam bowler who can bat, for hell allow us options, he maintained.         
	That, well, has been talked about for quite a while now...         
	Dhoni, incidentally, declined to pick the favourite. All the teams (in the semi-finals) are good... Whoever plays better on the day will win...         
	The Cricket South Africa chief executive, Gerald Majola, has publicly called for answers after Graeme Smith and Co. exited in the first-round. One is waiting for the Board of Control for Cricket in India to react.         
	Actually, the response of the selectors back home will be more interesting.         
	I dont think the selectors did the right thing by bringing back 36-year-old Rahul Dravid... He was under pressure in every match and that wont change... Its time to look beyond the Dravids, a former India captain told The Telegraph.         
	Dravid top-scored against Pakistan, but wasnt able to finish it off, in Centurion. He was run out both in that match and at the Wanderers here on Wednesday.         
	According to manager Anurag Thakur, the team will be departing late on Thursday.         
	Footnote: Young Virat Kohli, MoM against the West Indies with an unbeaten 79, said that the bouncy wickets in Australia, during the Emerging Players competition, had helped him adjust quicker in South Africa.

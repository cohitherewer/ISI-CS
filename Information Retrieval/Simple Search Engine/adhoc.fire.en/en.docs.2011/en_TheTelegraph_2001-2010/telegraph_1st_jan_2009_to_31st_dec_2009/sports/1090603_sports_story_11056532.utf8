The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pace cost Ishant swing: Manoj
                                                   Pace cost Ishant swing: Manoj
                      
	Jaipur: Former Test player Manoj Prabhakar feels the pursuit of extra speed has robbed Ishant Sharma of his ability to swing the ball.         
	He wants to bowl around 140mph all the time. In the process his wrist position is not keeping steady and he has lost his swing. He will have to learn quickly, said Prabhakar, now coach of the Rajasthan Ranji Trophy team for the next season.         
	The 46-year-old former player is also not happy with Irfan Pathan, who he feels needs to be supple.         
	Irfan has been able to lock his wrist after seeking advice from Wasim Akram, but he is still too stiff, Prabhakar said.         
	A bowler has to be supple. I gave tips to RP Singh and he has fine-tuned to emerge the most successful bowler in IPL II, said the former swing bowler. Prabhakar also hoped that Ashish Nehra would be able to make a Team India comeback.         
	He is a fine bowler and hope he will make a comeback to the national team, he said.         
	Talking about Indias defence of their World Twenty20 title in England, Prabhakar said opener Virender Sehwag needs to be patient and find form.         
	The IPL showed the Indian opening pair of Gautam Gambhir and Sehwag in poor form. Sehwag will have to be more patient when playing in England. (PTI)

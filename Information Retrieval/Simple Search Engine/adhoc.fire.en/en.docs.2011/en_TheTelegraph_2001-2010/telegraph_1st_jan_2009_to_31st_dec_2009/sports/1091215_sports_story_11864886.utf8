The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Race to haveYuvi fit
                                                                                                                       7                                        Race to haveYuvi fit
    - Muralidharan has bruised fingers; malinga out with flu             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Yuvraj Singh being attended to by physio Nitin Patel on Monday. (PTI)                                 
	Rajkot: A race is on. Not to grab the latest worm coming out of the Tiger Woods can, but to get Yuvraj Singh fit for the opening ODI against Sri Lanka, here, on Tuesday.         
	For much of Monday, indications were that Yuvraj was unlikely to play. However, word came around 8.30 pm that the star all-rounder, a key member of Team India, may just be able to take the field.         
	Yuvraj, the MoM in Saturdays T20 International in Mohali, suffered a hairline fracture on his left little finger while fielding that day and was in pain till Monday afternoon.         
	A swelling, too, was visible. Possibly the result of having batted with the injury, in Mohali.         
	Yuvraj, of course, didnt bat or bowl during the match-eve practice session at the Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Ground and his body language didnt look encouraging, because of the discomfort, perhaps.         
	All concerned, though, are determined to win this race with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni making it clear that the Yuvraj-specific call would only be made shortly before the toss.         
	Theres definitely a degree of desperation, which just confirms that the senior pro is indispensable in all forms of limited overs cricket.         
	Should Yuvraj need to rest, Virat Kohli will benefit.         
	Actually, this hasnt been a particularly kind season for the injury-prone Yuvraj: He had to miss the Champions Trophy and the first ODI against Australia, in September-October, owing to a fracture on his right little finger.         
	Now, the injury is on the other hand.         
	Battered in the Test series and held 1-1 in the T20 Internationals, the visitors also have fitness-related worries.         
	Veteran Muttiah Muralidharan has bruised fingers on his bowling (right) hand and Lasith Malinga has flu  the normal one, not the type which struck Sreesanth last week.         
	Malinga, clearly, is out of the reckoning. As for Murali, manager Brendon Kuruppu informed that a medical update was awaited. Therefore, he looks doubtful.         
	Murali made no impression in the Test series and, so, must be eager to get a bagful in the ODIs. Given that scenario, the hosts would profit big if both Malinga and Murali dont make the XI.         
	Whats confirmed is that the peerless Sanath Jayasuriya wont open. Unless theres a change in strategy, the Sri Lanka innings is going to be launched by the exciting Tillekaratne Dilshan and Upul Tharanga.         
	Traditionally, the wicket in Rajkot has favoured batsmen, but the first half-an-hour is likely to be challenging. Despite that drawback, the captain winning the toss would be tempted to set a target instead of having to possibly face a huge ask.         
	Not that Dhoni, who keeps cards very close to his chest (quite like Rahul Dravid), made any commitment.         
	Currently on a high, a pretty upbeat Dhoni told The Telegraph: It sure feels very nice to be the captain of the No.1 Test team and the No. 2 side in ODIs... Its good... But, yes, it could get better!         
	Boy, hes hungry.         
	Going by rankings alone, Sri Lanka, at No. 7, dont stand a chance. Having said that, rankings dont mean everything and it would be foolish to read too much into who stands where.         
	The seasoned Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan, who were rested for the T20 Internationals, are back. That cant be pleasing news for Kumar Sangakkara and Co.         
	Meanwhile, all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, Saurashtras very own, is set for his first Team India appearance at a venue where he has cut his teeth.         
	The five-match series will be fought for the trophy presented by Karbonn Mobiles.         
	INDIA (likely): Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Yuvraj Singh/Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Ravindra Jadeja, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Praveen Kumar, Ashish Nehra.         
	Match starts: 9.00 am.         
	Footnote: According to Niranjan Shah, the Saurashtra Cricket Association secretary, he and his team were ready to host the second ODI (on Friday), as well. I just needed to apply for, and receive, the police clearance...

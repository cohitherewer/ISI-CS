            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: Its not confirmed, but a well-placed source of The Telegraph in Sri Lanka has indicated that the possibility of the cricket captaincy being split probably made Mahela Jayawardene decide to step down after the upcoming two-Test series in Pakistan.  
	The 31-year-old captains decision (made known on Wednesday), though, came as a big surprise.  
	Apparently, the selectors had been looking at the possibility of giving the ODI and Twenty20 captaincy to No.2 Kumar Sangakkara, while retaining Mahela as the Test captain.         
	That, it seems, was indirectly conveyed to Mahela during the just-ended ODI series against India, which was disastrous to say the least. Sri Lanka could win only one of the five matches. That too the last.         
	Its a scoreline which would also have severely embarrassed chief selector Asantha de Mel.         
	According to the well-placed source, Mahela (adjudged the ICCs best in 2006), who has been an elder statesman in the dressing room, probably felt it would be better to leave the captaincy in all forms to one person.         
	That he hadnt been consistent, of late, may have contributed to his decision.         
	Sangakkara, on the other hand, has been in form and top-scored in the ODIs against India.         
	As Mahela himself put it, his decision has been in the best interests of Sri Lanka and would allow Sangakkara to settle down before the biggest challenge  the 2011 World Cup.         
	Mahela is, of course, Sri Lankas most successful Test captain. Hell also be remembered for taking his team to the 2007 World Cup final.         
	Sangakkara is just as highly respected and most see him as a distinctly cerebral cricketer, quite like a Rahul Dravid. The difference is that Sangakkara is a master in all forms.         
	Clearly, this is a bad year for captains, with two (Kevin Pietersen, Shoaib Malik) already sacked and Ricky Ponting under severe pressure. Mahela, though, has scripted his own exit.         
	Very gracefully too.         
	Tillekeratne Dilshan, meanwhile, could get the vice-captaincy once Sangakkara is anointed captain.

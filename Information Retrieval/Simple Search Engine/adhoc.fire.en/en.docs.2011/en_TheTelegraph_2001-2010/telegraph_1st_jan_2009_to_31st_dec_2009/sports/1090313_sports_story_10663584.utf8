The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin likely to rest
                                                   Sachin likely to rest
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar is unlikely to take the field, even if declared fit, for the final ODI against New Zealand in Auckland on Saturday. With India having already won the series, the team management will not be willing to take a risk.         
	Sachin missed the fourth ODI in Hamilton after an abdomen injury during the third match of the series. The idea is to keep him fresh for the Test series, which begins in Hamilton from March 18.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Three Aussies ruled out
                                                   Three Aussies ruled out
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: James Hopes and Nathan Bracken will miss this seasons IPL after Cricket Australia medical staff confirmed Thursday that both will return home. Shane Watson will also be unavailable with a groin strain.         
	Hopes is contracted to Kings XI Punjab while Bracken and Watson were supposed to play for Royal Challengers Bangalore and Rajasthan Royals, respectively.         
	Australian team doctor Trefor James, who examined the players in Dubai Wednesday, said Hopes and Bracken were suffering from injuries and would be best served by returning home. Watson was injured while batting during the Twenty20 tie against Pakistan in Dubai Thursday.         
	Hopes and Bracken have existing knee problems and it has been decided that a period of rest and rehabilitation over the next two to three weeks will be the best preparation for both players, a Cricket Australia media release said. With the amount of cricket the one-day international players have played and given the Australian teams schedule for the next 12 months, it is important we continue to manage player workloads and injury concerns.

                                                   Himmat in front
                      
	Johor Bahru: Indias Himmat Rai shot a five-under 67 on Friday to take the lead after two rounds of the Iskandar Johor Open, as organisers reduced the tournament to a 54-hole event due to ongoing bad weather.         
	Fridays play was suspended due to lightning with 24 players yet to complete their second round. This followed a long delay to Thursdays opening round, prompting organisers to cut back the event.         
	Rai was likely to retain his second-round lead, as those yet to complete the round were well off his score.

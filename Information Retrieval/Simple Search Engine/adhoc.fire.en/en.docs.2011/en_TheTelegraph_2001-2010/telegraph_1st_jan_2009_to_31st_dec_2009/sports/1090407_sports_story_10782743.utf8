                                                   Catches record now Dravids
                      
	Wellington: Rahul Dravid scaled another lofty peak in his illustrious career when he became the world-record holder for the most number of Test catches by a fielder here on Monday.         
	Dravid pulled ahead of Mark Waugh (181 catches in 128 Tests) in his 134th match when he gobbled up New Zealand batsman Tim McIntosh at third slip off Zaheer Khan.         
	Having snared Nasser Hussain off Javagal Srinath to open his account in his debut Test at Lords, Dravid is now clearly ahead of Ricky Ponting (148 in 131 Tests), Jacques Kallis (147 in 131) and Mahela Jayawardene (142 in 102) among the current players.         
	Taking catches has sort of given me probably as much pleasure as scoring runs. It is being part of someone elses success as a catcher. That has been a thrilling experience for me. To have taken so many catches is also a reflection of the quality of attack that I have been lucky to have played with, Dravid had said when he had drawn level with Mark Waugh in the first Test in Hamilton.  
	DAY IV HIGHLIGHTS  
	 Rahul Dravid now holds the record of taking most catches (183) among fielders in Tests. He went past the previous record of 181 catches held by Australian Mark Waugh, who had held the record since July 2001, when he went past Mark Taylor's tally of 157 catches.
  For the first time in history, three players from the subcontinent hold the records for most runs (Sachin Tendulkar: 12773), most wickets (Muttiah Muralidharan: 770) and most catches (Rahul Dravid: 183).
  Mahendra Singh Dhoni (52 amp; 56 n.o.) became the first wicketkeeper captain in Test history to register two 50-plus scores in the same Test match on more than two occasions. Zimbabwean Tatenda Taibu had done this on two occasions.

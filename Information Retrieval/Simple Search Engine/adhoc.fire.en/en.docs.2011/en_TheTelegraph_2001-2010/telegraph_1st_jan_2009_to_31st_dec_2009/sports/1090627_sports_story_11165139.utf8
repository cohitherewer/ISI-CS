                                                   ODIs under flu watch
                      
	Kingston: The ODI series between India and the West Indies has been put under special swine flu surveillance in view of the H1N1 virus spread to Jamaica.         
	Responding to calls for the banning of public events, Jamaican health minister Ruddy Spencer has ordered for special measures to prevent the spread of the virus at events where people gather in large numbers. Teams of more than 40 individuals will be on surveillance work for each match of the four-match series. Similar measures have also been ordered for the National Athletics Championships starting here Saturday.         
	So cricketers, those of you who like cricket go to cricket. But if you have flu-like symptoms you should stay home and if you go, you should stay away from infected people, Spencer said. (PTI)

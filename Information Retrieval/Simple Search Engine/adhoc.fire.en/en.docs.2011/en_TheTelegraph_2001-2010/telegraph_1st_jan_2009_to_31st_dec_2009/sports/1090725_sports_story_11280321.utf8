The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cavendish takes 19th stage 
                                                   Cavendish takes 19th stage 
                      
	Aubenas: Mark Cavendish of Britain won the 19th stage of the Tour de France on Friday, and Alberto Contador retained his commanding overall lead with two racing days left.         
	Cavendish earned his fifth stage victory this year, edging Thor Hushovd of Norway and Gerald Ciolek of Germany in the relatively flat 178-kilometer (110.6-mile) ride from Bourgoin-Jallieu to Aubenas. They all finished in 3 hours, 50 minutes, 35 seconds.         
	Lance Armstrong crossed with the same time to retain third place overall, trimming four seconds off his deficit to Contador and second-place Andy Schleck of Luxembourg.         
	While Hushovd is likely to win the green jersey awarded to the Tours best sprinter this year, Cavendish became the first racer to win five Tour stages in a single year since Armstrong in 2004.         
	This is a high point in my career, Cavendish said.         
	Overall, Contador leads Schleck by 4:11 and Armstrong by 5:21 heading into the last big stage  Saturdays 167-kilometer (103.8-mile) ride from Montelimar to a punishing uphill finish up the famed Mont Ventoux.         
	The race ends Sunday in Paris at Champs-Elysees.           (AP)

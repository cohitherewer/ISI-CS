                                                   John Buchanan: Australia will make a comeback
    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  Ashes-winning coach on current series             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              Caption      
	Calcutta: John Buchanan, who was Australias coach when they regained the Ashes in 2006-07, spoke to The Telegraph from Brisbane on Saturday. Incidentally, in the build-up to the ongoing contest, hed been roped in as a consultant by the England and Wales Cricket Board.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q What was your reaction when Australia lost the Lords Test, falling 0-1 behind?         
	A I have said from the outset that the team which can consistently win the battle at the top of the order should be the one to win the (five-Test) series... At Lords, Australias top order batsmen didnt handle Englands bowlers well in the first innings... From that point, it was catch-up cricket and England did not really give Australia a chance to do so.         
	Did you, at any time, think that the 522-run target would be achieved?         
	As an Australian, I always thought there was a chance  that is the way we play.         
	The Australians were outplayed for 90 per cent of the Test, quite amazing that...         
	It happened because of Australias failure in the first innings (conceding a lead of 210).         
	Can Ricky Ponting and Co. make a comeback?         
	There is no question about it, Australia will make a comeback... I think it is a series where neither team will be in front for a long time... As soon as you think you are on top, the other team will come steaming back into the contest.         
	Whats your message for Ponting and coach Tim Nielsen?         
	Ignore all those who are providing comment on the team and who know little about it.         
	Did any of your tips make a difference?         
	Look, in the lead-up, I spent only a very brief time with (director of cricket) Andy Flower and (captain) Andrew Strauss...         
	Are you in touch with Englands think tank?         
	No.         
	Do you intend going to England again at any point during the remainder of the Ashes?         
	There is no plan.         
	Will you feel awkward when you next meet Ponting or Nielsen?         
	No.         
	Your impression of Flower, who has been getting kudos?         
	I like him... He seems very thoughtful, as he was when he used to play... He appears very calm and it does seem he has quickly earned the respect of those around him.         
	A word on Strausss captaincy...         
	I think he and Flower are doing a very good job at keeping things pretty low-key and balanced, from what I can judge.         
	Jeff Thomson, a fellow-Queenslander, has called Ponting a crap captain. Whats your reaction?         
	I would not like to specifically react to what Thomson has said... However, Ricky is a fantastic leader, but goes about the captaincy differently, in the sense he is the consulting type... It may appear too many people are taking decisions out in the middle, but he only involves others... He has been learning and, in my opinion, getting better and better.         
	Did Australia make too much of the so-called delaying tactics by England in the first Test, in Cardiff?         
	I do not think so.         
	Your thoughts on those tactics?         
	Any sporting team in the world will, in similar circumstances, use delaying tactics, if allowed to do so by the umpires and referees.         
	Australia won the Ashes thrice (2001, 2002-03, 2006-07) during your tenure as coach... What actually makes the difference in an Ashes contest  the ability to handle pressure or is it sheer cricketing skills or something else?         
	You have got to understand that the contest goes back 127 years and carries the weight of history... With that comes a lot of introspection and reflection and analysis... In time, the same could be done with an India-Australia contest... The team which can deal with the distractions better will do better.         
	Kevin Pietersens out of the rest of the Ashes. Just how big a blow is it to England?         
	It is a major blow... He had not performed, or at least had the impact he and England would have liked (in the first two Tests), but I am sure England were banking on him for the remainder of the Ashes... He has a presence which few Englishmen have... He has the batting ability to change games, take games away from an opposition... Those features are now lost to England, so they will have to compensate in other ways.         
	Where, in your view, will Andrew Flintoff rank among the all-time great all-rounders?         
	Not highly statistics-wise, but in terms of impact in key moments in a game, he is up with the best of them.         
	Some in India have accused you of having been rather uncharitable towards some of the biggest cricketers in your latest book, The Future of Cricket: The Rise of T20, only to boost sales...         
	If people choose to read the book carefully, they will find that bit to be incorrect and unfair... Certainly, a couple of Indian cricketers along with some overseas players, have received a phrase or line of comment to illustrate points made about the future of cricket. If individuals choose to read those few words as a personal attack, then that is for them to decide.         
	What will you be doing during the IPLs third edition, next year?         
	As I have said in my book, the 20-over game is the future and the IPL has done an amazing job in bringing this form of cricket to the world. I was, and still am disappointed, not to have been able to continue with the Kolkata Knight Riders to build something special. If given the opportunity to be involved again, I would gladly consider the proposition.         
	The final one: Sourav Ganguly is turning quizmaster for a TV show in Bengali. You may not understand the entire content, but would you still watch it, perhaps on your next visit to Calcutta?         
	(Laughs) Of course, yes.

                                                     Rai closes in on title
            A STAFF REPORTER    
	Calcutta: Himmat Singh Rai closed in on his first ever professional title after an exceptional finish in Round III at the Professional Golf Tour of India Players Championship at the Tollygunge Club Thursday..         
	A positive outing helped him regain sole lead after he returned a three under 67. The Delhi golfer, who fired scores of 65 and 70 earlier in the two rounds, finished Day III with a total of eight-under 202.         
	Overnight joint leader Sanjay Kumar is a stroke behind at second with a total of seven-under 203.         
	Sanjay is followed by Vinod Kumar and city golfer S.S.P. Chowrasia, with five-under 205 and four-under 206 respectively, at the third and fourth place at the end of Round III.         
	On the day, Himmat sank birdies on the second, seventh, 10th, 16th, 18th and bogeyed the fifth and 13th in round three. The 21-year-old from Delhi was trailing his Lucknow opponent Sanjay Kumar by as many as three shots on the 15th hole.         
	He however, rallied with some exceptional shots to take the lead on the 18th hole.         
	I feel today I played really well. I not only recovered from some tricky situations, I was pretty solid too, Himmat said.         
	Asked to describe his overall performance on the day, the Delhi golfer said: I concentrated on hitting it straight and made some long putts as well. I made a 20 feet putt for birdie from the fringe of the green on the 10th and sank an important 10 feet putt for the lead on the 18th.         
	Meanwhile, Sanjay who birdied the fourth, sixth, 10th and 13th, seemed to be heading for a low score in the third round. However, a couple of bogeys on the 16th and 17th saw him finishing with a round of 68.         
	Mukesh Kumar and Harendra Gupta are at tied seventh with identical overall scores of one under 209.

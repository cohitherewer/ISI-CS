                                                   Want to take India to the top: Saina
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Ace shuttler Saina Nehwal says she is already feeling like No. 1 but making it to the top in the world rankings is not her immediate goal.         
	I feel like I am the world No.1 even though I am not. Beating two Chinese players back to back (on her way to winning the Indonesian Open last month) is not easy and I am still relishing it, the 19-year-old said at a felicitation ceremony Saturday.         
	The badminton ace is currently ranked sixth in the world in singles after becoming the first Indian woman to win a Super Series title  the Indonesian Open.         
	Becoming the de facto numero uno, however, is still some distance away, she said.         
	I can claim to be No.1 only when I consistently beat the top-10 players. Its going to be tough to do it. At the moment I want to break into the top-5 and then the top-3. Becoming the top singles player is still some distance, the Hyderabad girl said.         
	Nehwal, who beat mentor and coach Pullela Gopichand in an exhibition match before the felicitation ceremony, said she had learnt her lessons from the quarter final defeat that followed her Indonesian Open triumph.         
	A Super Series win was a big thing for me and, after such a big win, I didnt know how to prepare for the following week, she said. Maybe I have to improve my stamina. Maybe my stamina is good for one week but not two.         
	Nehwal, who was presented a cheque for Rs 2.5 lakh by Badminton 45, a trust founded by the late Aditya Vikram Birla, had a piece of advice for the new crop who were keen to follow in her footsteps.         
	I would like to take Indian badminton to the top level. To all the youngsters aspiring to play this game, I would like to say one thing, its a tough sport. If you want to beat the Chinese players, you have to work 13 hours a day, she said.         
	There are many who become doctors and engineers. They all work hard to reach there. Badminton is not easy either, you must be prepared to work hard.         
	Echoing her thoughts was Gopichand.         
	Two instances always come to mind when I think about Saina. The first was during the Beijing Olympics. The day after her quarter final loss, I asked her if she was ready to go for the routine training at 6.00 am.         
	She said, sir, please I thought she was going to say no. And then she said, lets go at 7.00 am, I want to sleep another hour.         
	Similarly, after winning the Indonesian Open, she was there in the gym at 8 clock for two hours. Thats the discipline you need to be where she is today.         
	Nehwal said that not having a top woman player in Indian badminton to look up to had never been a problem for her.         
	I was always following the boys. I followed Prakash (Padukone) sir and Gopi sir. I looked up to them. Gopi sir was my role model ever since he won the All-England title. I told myself, if they could do it, I can do it too.

	Calcutta: In-form Cheteshwar Pujara hurt his left knee during an intra-Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) practice match on Monday.         
	Because of the injury, its unlikely he will play the last two warm-up matches, against Free State, on Tuesday. Right-hand batsman Pujara has shone regularly with the bat in the practice matches in South Africa.         
	In Mondays practice match, Sourav Ganguly XI beat Brendon McCullum XI by seven wickets.         
	Batting first, McCullum XI scored 140 for the loss of six wickets. In reply, Sourav XI scored 143 for the loss of three wickets.         
	Aakash Chopra and Morne van Wyk scored half-centuries for McCullum XI and Sourav XI respectively.         
	West Indies captain Chris Gayle, who joined the KKR camp in Bloemfontein on Sunday, did not play in Mondays match. However, it was learnt he will take part in Tuesdays match.         
	Meanwhile, principal owner Shah Rukh Khan will be reaching South Africa on Tuesday but he will head straight for Cape Town, the venue of the Knight Riders first match in the second edition of the Indian Premier League.         
	Shah Rukh will meet the squad there on Wednesday, once the Knights leave Bloemfontein.         
	KKR play their first match against Deccan Chargers on Sunday.

	Montreal: Roger Federer, playing for the first time since winning Wimbledon, returned to the court with a 7-6 (3), 6-4 win over Canadas Frederic Niemeyer at the Montreal Masters Tuesday.         
	Federer, who took time off while his wife gave birth to twin girls, took a set to find his range and then the top-ranked Swiss star put away the low-ranked Niemeyer.         
	Mahesh Bhupathi and partner Mark Knowles too had it easy as they advanced to the pre-quarter finals after getting a bye in the first round. The Indo-Bahamian pair, seeded third, will now take on Jeff Coetzee of South Africa and Jurgen Melzer of Austria for a place in the last-eight.         
	The 33-year-old Niemeyer, whose ranking has tumbled to 487th, plans to retire at the end of this season.         
	Hes a nice man, said Federer. Its sad when you leave the game, but he seems happy with himself, so I wish him well. We played each other in a satellite in front of two people. It was snowing outside. And 11 years later were playing in front of a packed house here in Montreal.         
	Earlier, Andy Murray  also playing his first match since Wimbledon  beat Frances Jeremy Chardy 6-4, 6-2. Murray will next face the winner between Juan Carlos Ferrero and 13th-seeded Gael Monfils.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger and Roger talk their way to victory
                                                     Tiger and Roger talk their way to victory
            Mark Reason            Tiger Woods                           
	Tiger Woods rang French Open winner Roger Federer twice over the weekend and then went out and won the Memorial Tournament in Dublin, Ohio, with a final round of 65. Who inspired who?         
	Maybe these two need to be banned from talking to each other. If the greatest is discussing tactics with the greatest, what chance have mere mortals got?         
	The American Woods said on Sunday evening: Roger was impressive to watch. I talked to him a little bit yesterday (Monday) and a little this (Tuesday) morning. Its just phenomenal how hes moving again. He was hurt for a while there.         
	His back was bothering him, and then he had the whole mono thing last year (when the Swiss tennis player suffered mononucleosis  an infection caused by a virus that can produce flu-like symptoms and extreme, lingering fatigue). But its just truly remarkable when he gets it going. He just hits shots that nobody else can hit. Its fun to watch.         
	Asked if he became emotional watching Federer defeat Swedens Robin Soderling in straight sets, Woods said: Absolutely no doubt. I was pulling for him. I was as nervous as can be for him. A couple of times there, Soderling had break point in the third set. Roger is off a break, and Im like, Dont lose this break. I was yelling at the TV, the whole deal.         
	It is good to know that Woods is a wide-eyed, couch-potato fanatic like the rest of us, but that is where the comparison ends. His performance at the Memorial over the past few days will send a shiver through the rest of golf. Asked when he had last hit the ball as well for a whole week, Woods said: Hoylake.         
	That was at the Open Championship three years ago and Woods may have even hit the ball better these past few days. In recent years his wonky driving has given the rest a chance, but at Memorial he did not miss one fairway in the final round and he missed only seven out of 56 over the entire four days.         
	Part of the improvement is technical, as Woods has put more loft on his driver, but the vast majority is physical. Following his knee surgery last summer, Woods said that he had not been able to practise between competitive rounds and my shot selection was diminished. Woods was protecting a knee that still puffed up and needed ice after exercise.         
	Yet now, he said: Im able to get back out there and work on my game. I dont have all my length back. Its getting better each and every week. My speed is coming back. My powers coming back.         
	After Woods birdied the final two holes on Sunday, his American countryman Jim Furyk  who finished one shot back in second  pleaded with the media to quit making him keep proving stuff.         
	It may already be too late. The US Open starts next week and Woods appears to have his power back.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	Bangalore: Rahul Dravid (118) and Dinesh Karthik (103) combined to rescue South Zone from a top-order collapse, guiding them to a 348-run second-innings lead against Central Zone on the third and penultimate day of their Duleep Trophy match here Saturday.         
	South Zone ended the day 345 for six riding on the duos 125-run fifth-wicket partnership.         
	Earlier, Central Zones first innings ended just two balls into the morning session as L. Balaji removed Umesh Yadav for a duck to bundle out the team for 326, falling three runs short of South Zones first-innings total of 329.         
	Souths second essay didnt start all that well either and openers Abhinav Mukund (1) and Robin Uthappa (16) were dismissed early on. While Uthappa fell to Pankaj Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar cleaned up Mukunds defence.         
	S. Badrinath, sent up the order at No.3, came a cropper, too, and was dismissed for nought by Bhuvneshwar, leaving South reeling at 24 for three in the ninth over. But Dravid and Arjun Yadav (68) steadied the innings to close the morning session at 102 for three.         
	The duos partnership yielded 154 runs for the fourth wicket before Yadav edged a Murali Kartik delivery to wicketkeeper Naman Ojha.         
	Next man Karthik picked up from where Yadav had left off and combined with Dravid for another solid partnership that came off 173 balls.         
	But after a patient 217-ball knock, Dravid departed caught behind by Ojha off the bowling of Bhuvneshwar. The former India skipper struck 17 fours during his patient innings.         
	Karthik, however, held the other end, completing a fast-paced 120-ball century that was studded with 17 fours.         
	M. Suresh added another 15 runs to the total before becoming Umesh Yadavs victim, leaving Karthik and R. Ashwin (4) as the two unbeaten batsmen at the crease when stumps were drawn.         
	With the second-innings century, Karhtik became only the seventh batsman to score a hundred in each innings of a Duleep Trophy match.         
	Brief scores         
	South Zone 329 amp; 345/6 (R. Dravid 118, D. Karthik 103). Central Zone 326. Match to continue.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Madan Lal blames it on set-up
                                                                                                                       7                                      Madan Lal blames it on set-up
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former India all-rounder Madan Lal feels that most of the state associations lack proper infrastructure and least emphasis is given on having good playing conditions.         
	It is purely due to lack of a professional structure that state associations are going off the track sometimes and continuing with this useless blame game, the member of the 1983 World Cup-winning squad said on the sidelines of the Asian Chess Championship Monday.         
	Madan Lal said not only the sacked chairman of the BCCIs grounds and pitches committee Daljit Singh should be held responsible for Sundays Kotla pitch fiasco but also the local curator Vijay Bahadur Mishra.         
	Yes Daljit too needs to own up responsibility after what happened on Sunday. But according to me, its the venue curator (Mishra) whos the main culprit.         
	Its he who has laid such a lousy pitch, Lal seemed furious.         
	Former Bengal captain Ashok Malhotra who was also present at the function put the entire blame on Daljit.         
	He is the one who should be blamed for such an incident. I was surprised that they continued for 23 overs.         
	The match should have been stopped much earlier, Malhotra said.

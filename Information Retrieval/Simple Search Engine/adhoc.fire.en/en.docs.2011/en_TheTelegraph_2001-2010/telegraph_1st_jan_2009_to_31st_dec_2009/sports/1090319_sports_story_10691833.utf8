The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Certainly a competitive score, says Vettori
                                                     Certainly a competitive score, says Vettori
            A CORRESPONDENT            Ishant Sharma in action against New Zealand in Hamilton on Wednesday. (AP)                           
	Hamilton: Daniel Vettori played a captains knock down the order on Wednesday and, along with Jesse Ryder, who scored his maiden Test century, took New Zealand to 279 in their first innings. Vettori agreed that the Black Caps first innings score was below par, but said that it was still a competitive one.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On the first days play         
	Obviously disappointed with the situation we put ourselves in. India put up an excellent bowling performance today. There was just enough in the wicket to suggest that it was difficult batting on it. They made the most of the conditions and swung the ball as well.         
	It was a tough morning session. But once the ball got a little bit older, it was easier to bat on. Fortunately, Jesse and I batted for a long time and put a competitive score on the board. Certainly below par, but certainly a competitive score.         
	The crucial partnership with Jesse Ryder         
	The important thing for Jesse and me was that we play our natural games and we dont get reckless with it. Sometimes, when you are 60 for six, you tend to take undue risks. So it was important to stick to our natural game.         
	On the wicket         
	Its a good batting ground. It did a bit this morning but once it flattened out its a really good deck to bat on.         
	The importance of crossing the 250-run mark         
	It makes a difference to the dressing-room once we start to get on top in a partnership. The boys start thinking on how to plan their bowling. You get the motivation to perform.         
	Ryders batting order         
	He started his Test career batting at No. 3. But since hes slipped down to No. 5 his form has been outstanding.         
	On Ryders innings         
	To be fair Jesse has batted pretty well in Test cricket so far. He batted efficiently to register his first Test hundred.         
	Would he have batted first had he won the toss?         
	Yeah, we would have batted first. We knew the morning session would be a little tough. But we thought, if we could get through that first session, say be 80 for 1 or 80 for 2, then we could have maximised later. But India bowled really well.         
	You have to give credit to Ishant who swung it and Zaheer who put it in the right areas. They made it pretty difficult for us.         
	Who holds the advantage after the first day?         
	We gained momentum through our partnership but if you just looked at the scores you would say Indias on top.

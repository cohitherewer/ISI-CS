	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan, ahead of the Federation Cup next month, will look to sharpen their skills when they take on Kalighat Milan Samity in a CFL alcutta Football League encounter Wednesday.         
	Also, on the agenda will be Ryuji Sueoka, Bagans new Japanese recruit in the Asian quota.         
	Ryuji, who has been impressive in practice, signed in favour Bagan Tuesday. The attacking midfielder is being seen as an important cog for the green and maroon brigades campaign in the remaining of the I-League. However, Ryuji, in all probability is unlikely to start and might have a role to play later in the match         
	However, Bagans Brazilian star Jose Barreto is still not match-fit and will not be in the coachs plan on the morrow. Coach Karim Bencharifa will go in with striker Edeh Chidi as the lone forward in the starting line-up. Youngster Branco Cardozo will partner Chidi upfront.         
	Also making a comeback will be defender Sheikh Azim. The former Mohammedan Sporting player will share the responsibility at the heart of defence alongside Sangram Mandi. Zenith Genius and Biswajit Saha are the others who will be in charge of the Bagan fortress.         
	Tomba Singh and Ishfaq Ahmed will operate down the wings with Micky Fernandes and under-19 Souvik Mazumdar playing in the central midfield.         
	Shilton Paul will be the man under the bar for Bagan on Wednesday. Bencharifa said they played against Kalighat Milan Samity earlier, though in practice matches. But citing this to be an official match, the Moroccan said: It will be an official affair and that is different from practice matches. Moreover, I will be missing quite a few players who are in the national camp.

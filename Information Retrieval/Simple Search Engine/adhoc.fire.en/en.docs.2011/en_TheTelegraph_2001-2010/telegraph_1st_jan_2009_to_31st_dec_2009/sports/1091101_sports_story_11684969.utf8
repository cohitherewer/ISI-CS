The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Sparta may come good on Day I
                                                                                                               Sparta may come good on Day I 
            STAR RACER      
	Calcutta: Excitement begins at the stroke of 12.30pm, on Sunday, when the new season takes off. The eight-event card framed for the afternoon is not only competitive, it is also rich in quality for a seasons opener. Each of the two trophy events on the cards  the 1,200m Bollywood Dreams Cup and the 1,400m Ich Dien Cup  promise some action as both Snowden and Sparta are out to notch up their fourth successive victory.           
	Snowden, from trainer Pesi Shroffs yard, has been winning his races in facile manner. The main factor in the race is trainer Vijay Singhs Accalia, who is beginning to show her old sparks.          
	Trainer Arti Doctors Sparta (P. Kamlesh-up), on the other hand, faces a strong challenger in the speedy Queen Of Hearts, her stablemate who has reeled off two smart wins during the monsoon season. Fire Within has also done fairly well during the same season but the Imtiaz Sait-trained ward may find the cracking pace of Queen Of Hearts to his utter disadvantage.          
	The two horses in the afternoons card  Accessor and Royal Dance  select themselves in their respective events  the Wandering Angel Handicap and the Play Boy Handicap. Their monsoon form has been impressive.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

                                                   Need to improve tactically: Saina
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hyderabad: Saina Nehwal has accomplished a lot of firsts in her career. She became the first Indian woman to win the Junior World Championships, clinch a Super Series title, and make the quarters of the World Badminton Championships. In conversation with The Telegraph, this is what the World No.6 had to say about her recent exploits and the future.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q The Chinese players are now scared of you. Its all boiled down to tactics and not so much to fitness. Your take?         
	A Yes, some of these players have begun to be scared of me. And players have now begun to talk only of tactics. I need to improve tactically and play better. Ive defeated most of these players before so Im not worried about the different tactics they will throw at me in the future. I intend to get fitter and give it my hundred per cent in the tournaments I play.         
	How do you intend to combat the Chinese threat?         
	I train with boys. The junior boys have begun to get very fast on court and its good practice to play with them. They are faster and stronger and it helps me develop my stamina when I play with them.         
	How do you cope with close losses?         
	I keep training. Thats the best way to go about it. You need to be disciplined and the results will automatically come. You have to forget about losses, else it will always pull you down. My coach always tells me to forget about the past. There are so many tournaments for us players these days; one cant dwell on the past.         
	Is mental strength important?         
	Of course it is. This time even though I hadnt fully recovered for the tournament, I had the mental strength to pull myself through. If one is mentally strong, sometimes one can pull out very close matches.         
	How important are rankings to you?         
	Not at all I dont care about them. Rankings are only temporary as they keep going up or down. I can become the worlds No.1 at any point but the most important thing is to win tournaments.         
	Who is your idol?         
	Ive always looked up to Taufik Hidayat in badminton. Else, Roger Federer is the absolute best!         
	Taufik claims that the World Championships have lost their sheen after becoming an annual event. Your opinion?         
	I dont think the Championships have lost their sheen. There should be something big every year for the players to look forward to. Ive participated in two Championships and I look forward to it every year. Wimbledon is there for tennis players annually and no one ever questions that. So, why question the World Championships?         
	Where do you play next?         
	Im taking some time off now. I play the China and Japan Opens in four weeks time.

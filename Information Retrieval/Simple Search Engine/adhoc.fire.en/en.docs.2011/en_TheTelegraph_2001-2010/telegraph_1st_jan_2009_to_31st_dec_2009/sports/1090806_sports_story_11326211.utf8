The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lahiri is at tied sixth
                                                     Lahiri is at tied sixth
                  Anirban Lahiri                     
	Petaling Jaya (Malaysia): Anirban Lahiri (67) stole the thunder from Gaganjeet Bhullar (74) and was the highest-placed Indian at tied sixth after the opening round of the weather-hit Worldwide Holdings Selangor Masters golf tournament here.         
	After opening with back-to-back bogeys, Lahiri made amends to sink in six birdies and an eagle against a couple of more dropped strokes to be three shots off the pace at the $300,000 event.         
	Rahil Gangjee was the only other Indian inside top-10 after carding a 68 to be tied for the 10th spot. Digvijay Singh was a stroke adrift of Gangjee at tied 15th. C. Muniyappa and Gaurav Ghei were tied for the 34th spot after returning identical 71s. Himmat Rais 73 saw him at tied 54th. At the top, Malaysias Danny Chia (64) seized a one-stroke lead.         
	Meanwhile, Jeev Milkha Singh, who has recovered from a rib injury, will return to action at the PGA Tours WGC-Bridgestone Invitational starting Thursday. Jeev was laid low for three weeks due to the injury which saw him missing the British Open.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Reliable 2nd singles player is needed
                                                     Reliable 2nd singles player is needed

	While our cricketers sprayed fours and sixes thick as the monsoon rain at Christchurch, Somdev Dev Varman vaulted over 93 ranking places to crush No.59 ranked Yen-Hsun Lu of Chinese Taipei 6/1, 6/2, 6/3 to take India to the World Group playoffs of the Davis Cup.         
	We now face the once mighty Australians who scraped through 3-2 in their tie against Thailand in Bangkok. The Ground Zero image of tennis in India was lit up by Somdevs brilliant performance that left us just one tie short of the elite World Group of 16.         
	Somdevs unexpected victory clinched the tie and saved the day for India. Had the tie gone to a fifth deciding match it would have been very difficult for the inconsistent Bopanna to come through  he had a disappointing tie and lost both his matches. He has a powerful serve and good ground-shots which, deployed with a tactical savvy, could take him close to the top 100 in the rankings.         
	His impatience, resulting in a high percentage of unforced errors, contributed to his downfall. The absence of a consistent reliable second singles player to support Somdev is a major weakness in our thinly manned Davis Cup team. Besides, Paes and Bhupathi are not as good as they were some years ago. They looked rusty and jaded. Time is taking its toll; also one cannot ignore or avoid the eroding effect of their continuing personal differences. In the near future we may not be able to go into our Davis Cup campaigns on the presumption that the doubles match is in our pocket.         
	The history of Indian tennis is replete with instances of our boys defeating much higher-ranked players in Davis Cup play. The Krishnans, both father and son, Vijay Amritraj, Jaidip Mukerjea, Premjit Lall, the serial giant slayer Leander Paes and others have regularly brought down much higher-ranked players in Davis Cup matches.                   Somdev Dev Varman       
	Somdevs big test will come in our next tie against Australia in early May. The Aussies will probably be led by former World No.1, Lleyton Hewitt. Unfazed by a hip replacement, an unyielding Hewitt with unmatched spirit battles on with high decibel screams of come on.         
	Against Thailand, Hewitt after leading two sets to love against Danai Udomchoke, Thailands No.1 player, lost in five sets. Possibly the heat and humidity of Bangkok wore down the tough Aussie.         
	Since the tie against Australia will be played in India, we should opt to play the match in Chennai for two reasons. First, Somdev excelled on the hardcourt surface there during the ATP tournament earlier this year and second, hopefully, the Chennai heat will affect the Australians more than it would our own players.         
	Apart from our Davis Cup victory against Chinese Taipei the good news is that Sania is back, having fought her way through a minefield of injuries. At last the penny seems to have dropped and she is now doing what she should have three years ago  seek help and advice from a world-class trainer and coach. By tying up briefly with Gil Reyes who scripted Agassis comeback and Soen Groeneveld, a coach familiar with top ten levels for a few tournaments, Sania has done the right thing, considerably improving her chances of achieving her full potential.

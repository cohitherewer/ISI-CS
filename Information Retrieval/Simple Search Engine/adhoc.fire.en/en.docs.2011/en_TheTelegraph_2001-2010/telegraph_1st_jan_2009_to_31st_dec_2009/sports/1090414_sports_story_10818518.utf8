                                                   EB okay, but with riders
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal will ask for a foreigner as replacement if the All India Football Federation (AIFF) takes away any domestic player in the middle of the season for its ambitious Goal 2011 plan.         
	The club held a meeting on Monday to discuss their stance on the revised Goal 2011 project. Club secretary Kalyan Majumdar said that they will follow country-over-club policy but the federation has to comply with a few conditions.         
	We have no problems with the revised plan. But we want some issues to be sorted out first, Majumdar said. He added: We would like to have the full list of the 25 players as we are in the process of building our squad.         
	Majumdar was also sceptical about whether the AIFF would stick to its original plan of 25 players. If they dont then we should be allowed to recruit a foreigner as a replacement. Also, the AIFF will have to reimburse the amount which would be spent on the player, he explained.         
	Five players from East Bengals current squad  Subrata Paul, Mehrajuddin Wadoo, Rennedy Singh, Syed Rahim Nabi and Sunil Chetri  are on the list. Surkumar Singhs name, however, is missing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ashraful does it for Bangla
                                                   Ashraful does it for Bangla
                      
	Bulawayo: Mohammed Ashraful hit an unbeaten 103 and Tamim Iqbal added 63 to steer Bangladesh to an eight-wicket win over Zimbabwe in the first ODI Sunday.         
	Ashraful smashed 12 boundaries and two sixes in 103 balls as Bangladesh made 211 losing two wickets. The visitors then bowled out Zimbabwe for 207 in 47.5 overs at the Queens Sports Club.         
	The last two years I was captain and I didnt bat that well, Ashraful said. Now, Im playing better and enjoying my cricket. I am more relaxed.         
	Bangladesh pace bowler Najmul Hossain took three for 29, with Mark Vermeulen top-scoring for Zimbabwe with 92 on his return to international cricket. Vermeulen put on 48 with Brendan Taylor, who scored 19 before Shakib al Hasan trapped him leg before wicket to make it 74 for three in the 21st over.         
	Wickets then fell at regular intervals, with Elton Chigumbura (20) and Charles Coventry (19) the only other Zimbabwean batsmen to get a start. We lost too many wickets and should have applied ourselves more, Utseya said.

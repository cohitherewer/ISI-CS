The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hayden left out of Twenty20, ODI squads 
                                                     Hayden left out of Twenty20, ODI squads 
            A STAFF REPORTER            Hayden                           
	Calcutta: Matthew Hayden has been left out of Australias 13-man squads for the upcoming Twenty20 Internationals and Commonwealth Bank ODI Series against South Africa.         
	National Selection Panel chairman Andrew Hilditch made it clear the teams were chosen with an eye on the Twenty20 World Cup later this year and 2011 World Cup while hinting he could not see Hayden playing a role in the two major events.         
	The announcement of these squads for the KFC Twenty20 Internationals and the Commonwealth Bank Series is a clear indication we are now in full-scale planning for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 and the 2011 ICC World Cup, Hilditch said.         
	Winning a fourth consecutive ICC World Cup and our first ICC Twenty20 title is an ambitious project. For this reason there will be very few players selected from this point that we cannot see playing a role in achieving this goal, he said.         
	THE SQUADS         
	Twenty20: Ricky Ponting (captain), Mike Hussey (vice-captain), David Hussey, B. Hilfenhaus, James Hopes, Nathan Bracken, Brad Haddin, Shaun Marsh, Shaun Tait, David Warner, Ryan Harris, Camaroon White, Nathan Hauritz.         
	ODI: Ricky Ponting (captain), Michael Clarke (vice-captain), Brad Haddin, James Hopes, Nathan Bracken, Shaun Marsh, Mike Hussey, David Hussey, Nathan Hauritz, B Hilfenhaus, Camaroon White, Shaun Tait, Peter Siddle.

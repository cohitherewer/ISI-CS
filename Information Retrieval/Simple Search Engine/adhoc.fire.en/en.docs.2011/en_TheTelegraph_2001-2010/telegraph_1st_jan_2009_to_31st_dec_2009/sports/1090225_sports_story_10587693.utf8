The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gill urges Buddha to follow suit
                                                   Gill urges Buddha to follow suit
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Union sports minister, M.S. Gill Tuesday urged Bengal chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to honour the forgotten heroes of the 1956 Olympic football team.         
	On Monday, seven members of the 1956 team were felicitated by Gill at a function in the capital.         
	In a letter to Bhattacharjee, Gill said: Yesterday (Monday), we held a function to greet, honour and present them with shawls, silver plaques, and cash awards.         
	Almost all of these players, who are alive, nine of them, are from Bengal, Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh. I would request you to honour all of them, not just those who may be from your state, in a similar fashion, with handsome cash awards which they badly need in their old age.         
	Such a gesture will not only honour them, but encourage todays generation to reach their level in football, and even win a gold medal, Gill said in his letter.         
	In order to avoid any delay, the minister has also attached the names and addresses of the footballers with his letter.         
	The Union sports minister has also sent identical letters to the chief ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.

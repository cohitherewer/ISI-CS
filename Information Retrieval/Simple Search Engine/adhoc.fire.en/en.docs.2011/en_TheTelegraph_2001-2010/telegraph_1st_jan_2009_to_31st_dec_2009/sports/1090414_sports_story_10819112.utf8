The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Macheda deal likely in August
                                                   Macheda deal likely in August
                      
	Milan: Manchester United could offer Federico Macheda a five-year deal when he turns 18 in August after the Italian striker scored two goals in his first two Premier League matches, his agent said on Monday.         
	When hes 18 well talk again. I think Manchester will ask us to sign a five-year deal and I think that would be logical because it makes no sense to lose a lad at 21, agent Giovanni Bia said. Macheda scored late winners in a 3-2 home win over Aston Villa and Saturdays 2-1 victory at Sunderland.

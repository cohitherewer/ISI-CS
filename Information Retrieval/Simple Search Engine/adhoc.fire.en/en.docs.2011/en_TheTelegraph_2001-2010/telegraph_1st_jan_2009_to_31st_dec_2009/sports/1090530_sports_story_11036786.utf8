The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ronaldos ego could try Alexs patience
                                                     Ronaldos ego could try Alexs patience
            Mark Ogden              Ronaldo                           
	Only Cristiano Ronaldo knows where he truly wants, or expects, to play football next season.         
	Ever since Real Madrid came calling last season, the Portuguese forwards future has rarely been an issue that could be described as settled or stable.         
	But regardless of the 24-year-olds intentions, Manchester United have no desire to lose their prized asset, a player who scored 42 goals last season and who fell narrowly short of 30 in this campaign.         
	Ronaldo puts United future on hold With Florentino Perez close to regaining the presidency at the Bernabeu, Ronaldos escape route appears to be closing. Perez, and his likely sporting director Zinedine Zidane, want Kaka and Franck Ribery ahead of Ronaldo.         
	Three into two doesnt go and Ronaldo is likely to be the odd one out. He might have to stay at United, whether he likes it or not.         
	Ronaldos open show of dissent against Sir Alex Ferguson when substituted during the Manchester derby earlier this month, followed by his apparent criticism of the managers game-plan against Barcelona, could prompt Ferguson to wash his hands of Ronaldo.         
	Only the complete breakdown of Fergusons relationship with Ronaldo would push the United manager to part with the player, despite his visible frustration with Ronaldo in Rome.         
	More than once, Ronaldo ignored Wayne Rooney and attempted to pierce the Barcelona rearguard alone.         
	The failure of the pair to link successfully resulted in one of Rooneys most unimpressive displays in a United shirt, but Ferguson is convinced that the left-sided role that Rooney has taken in recent months is the best position for the England forwards talents to have maximum impact.         
	Ronaldo, despite a high maintenance nature, remains a key cog in Fergusons team and the player himself has paid tribute to the Scots paternal treatment of him during his six years at Old Trafford.         
	The respect is clearly there, but Ferguson has never tolerated players becoming a problem in the dressing room. David Beckham, Roy Keane, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Paul Ince have all been dispatched by the United manager in the past after pushing his patience too far.         
	Ronaldo could be described as a unique case simply because of his undoubted talent and ability to turn United into winners. He failed to do that in Rome, however, and if that was because he was lulled into the pre-match hype of the game being a battle between himself and Lionel Messi, then it will be a cause of concern for Ferguson.         
	If he is beginning to take his eye off the ball for the sake of his own personal ambition, Ronaldo will pay a price. But if Madrid are no longer interested, he will pay that price at Old Trafford because it is unlikely that any other club will have the money to take him away.

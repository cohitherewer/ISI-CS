            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The West Indies Cricket Board announced Sunday that national team captain Chris Gayle will be rejoining the team for the upcoming three-match Test Series against Australia. He will leave for Down Under from Kingston on Monday.         
	Gayle had returned to his country last Wednesday, to be with his mother, who was hospitalised. The first Test starts at the Gabba, in Brisbane, Thursday.         
	Gayles mother was on Saturday discharged from the hospital. (Her discharge) is the best news anyone could get, these situations are very scary and I want to thank God to have her back home, Gayle said.         
	I want to thank my teammates and the team management for the support and I also want to thank West Indies Players Association, West Indies Cricket Board and all the fans for their prayers and best wishes, he said.

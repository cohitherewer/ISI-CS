The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mumbai Indians win in a canter vs the Kings XI
                                                     Mumbai Indians win in a canter vs the Kings XI
                  Sachin Tendulkar and Dwayne Bravo celebrate their victory on Tuesday                     
	Centurion: Dwayne Bravos sparkling unbeaten knock of 70 runs coupled with an impressive performance by the spinners helped the Mumbai Indians thrash the Kings XI Punjab by eight wickets in an Indian Premier League match on Tuesday. The victory kept the Mumbai sides hope for a semi-final berth alive.         
	The Mumbai Indians spin trio of Harbhajan Singh (one for 9), JP Duminy (two for 15) and Ajinkya Rahane (one for 5) bowled effectively and set the stage for the revenge win as they restricted the Punjab side to a paltry 119 for nine.         
	Sunny Sohal, who hit a quickfire 43 off 23, was the top scorer for the Kings XI after Yuvraj Singh chose to bat at the Supersport park.         
	The Mumbai Indians chase began on shaky note with Sanath Jayasuriya (4) once again falling cheaply, but Bravo, cashing in on a dropped chance, steered his team to a comfortable win with his 59-ball knock, bejewelled with seven fours and three sixes.                   
	With this win, the Mumbai side went up to the fourth spot in the points table, with 11 points from 11 matches.         
	Bravo, who was dropped on nought by Irfan Pathan on his own bowling in the second over of the innings, hit Sreesanth for two huge sixes and two fours to begin the firework and then lofted Yuvraj for a massive six over the sight screen.         
	The West Indies batsman shared an unbeaten 82-run stand for the third wicket with captain Sachin Tendulkar, who provided good support to him with his unconquered 29-ball 41.         
	Earlier, the Mumbai sides spinners, led by Harbhajan Singh, did not give much chance to the Kings XI batsmen to settle down on the turning track at the Supersport Park.         
	Harbhajan took just one wicket but bowled economically, giving away just nine runs in his four overs.         
	Had opener Sohal not produced his blazing knock before gifting away his wicket, the Punjab side would have struggled to reach the 100-run mark.         
	The Kings XIs script turned from bad to worse after five overs as their batsmen struggled to find ways to negotiate the slow bowlers. They lost wickets at regular intervals and in the process their run-rate nosedived.         
	It was a nightmarish start for Punjab as Simon Katich (0) miscued an on-drive off Dhawal Kulkarni and the leading edge ended up in the hands of Harbhajan.                   
	Irfan (0), promoted up the order, too departed without bothering the scorer as a terrible mix up with Sohal led to his run out.         
	Sohal, not perturbed by the twin-blow, hit three sixes on the off-side and played some elegant drives on the leg. However, his entertaining 23-ball knock ended when he carelessly stood out of the crease on Tendulkars misfield and the subsequent direct hit brought his end. Harbhajan ended Kumar Sangakkaras agony when the wily off-spinner castled the Sri Lankan just before the strategic break to reduce the Kings XI to 70 for four.         
	Duminy made matters worse for the Punjab side with his double strike in the 12th over, first removing Wilkin Mota (4) and then seeing off the dangerous Yuvraj (12).         
	With the big guns back to the hut, Karan Goel hit a patient and unbeaten 20 to take Punjab to 119.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan net one
                                                     Bagan net one
    - 2009 CFL Big two begin their campaign with contrasting victories           A STAFF REPORTER            Subhojit Majumder (in white) in action at the Mohun Bagan ground on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan missed chances galore against Kalighat Club but ultimately went home with three points in their opening match of the Calcutta Football League at the home ground on Wednesday.         
	Bagans under-19 player Subhojit Majumder scored the winner in the 18th minute.         
	Bagan could have won the match by a bigger margin but for the profligacy of their strikers.         
	Nigerian Edeh Chidis wretched form in front of the goal continued as he missed chances after chances.         
	The situation became such that even the Nigerian could not stop laughing at his own predicament.         
	His woeful form should give Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa some sleepless nights as East bengal are their next opponent on Sunday in a I-League match.         
	The sooner Chidi gets back to his original form the better for Bagan. The last thing Bagan would want a half-fit Jose Ramirez Barreto and a goal-shy Chidi against their arch-rivals.         
	After the change of ends Chidi missed so many that even the fans forgot to count. To be fair on this beleaguered striker even lady luck was not with him as he hit the post at least four times.         
	The pick of the miss story was in the 62nd minute when a Zenith Genius cross found an unmarked Chidi inside the six yard box.         
	With Kalighat goalkeeper Debasish Das completely out position only thing Chidi had to do was slot it home. But his hasty volley sailed into the stands leaving the Bagan bench stunned.         
	Chidis bunglings probably had an adverse impact on his replacement K Kulothungan too.         
	Immediately after coming in, Kulothungan had chance to make it 2-0 but failed to hit the back of the net from close.         
	The all-important goal came in the 18th minute. Latching onto a Suraj Mandal pass on the right flank, the TFA cadet went past his marker and slotted it home leaving the rival goalkeeper rooted to the ground.         
	Had he missed this chance, the end result would have something not much to Bencharifas liking.

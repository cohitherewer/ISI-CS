                                                   Praise for Sania
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The citys tennis fraternity hailed Sania Mirza and Mahesh Bhupathis triumph at the Australian Open Sunday as the best thing to have happened to Indian womens tennis and agreed that this victory, along with Yuki Bhambris boys singles title bodes well for Indian tennis. But the stalwarts differed on the reasons behind Sanias contrasting fortunes in singles and doubles.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Akhtar Ali: This is a fantastic win for Sania, especially because she had not played for six months. She obviously had the advantage of having the best doubles player as her partner. Im also very happy for Yuki. When I saw him at the South Club a few years back, I knew he could make it big. The fact that he is at the Nick Bollettieri Academy will help him a lot.         
	I dont think we can say Sania played badly in singles. Remember she lost to the world No.11 (Nadia Petrova). She was out of action for long. She needs some time to get back to her best in singles.         
	Naresh Kumar: Its wonderful news. That an Indian woman has won a Grand Slam is a really big thing. After the mens doubles final, I was almost sure that Mahesh and Sania would win. Because Mahesh played excellent tennis in the mens doubles final but didnt find enough support form his partner.         
	Sania is having problems in singles because lack of fitness matters less in doubles as you need to cover only the half the court. She is a very good doubles player because of her good return. But singles is a much more demanding proposition.         
	Jaidip Mukerjea: An Indian lady winning a Grand Slam is great. I think this will give Sania a lot of confidence for singles.         
	Its true that she hasnt done well in singles for some time but dont forget that she was injured. In doubles, she has Bhupathi by her side. That makes a lot of difference. She doesnt have that guidance in singles.

                                                   Bhupathi, Paes in quarters
                      
	New York: Indian aces Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes breezed into the quarter finals of the mixed doubles with their respective partners following straight set wins over their opponents in the US Open tennis tournament.         
	Top seeds Bhupathi and his American partner Liezel Huber eased past Jill Craybas and Eric Butorac of US 6-3, 6-3 in a 54-minute second-round match to stay in hunt.         
	They will next play either the Stephen Huss-Virginia Ruano Pascual pair or eighth seeds Nenad Zimonjic-Bethanie Mattek-Sands.         
	Second seeded combination of Leander Paes and Zimbabwes Cara Black saw off Italian Flavia Pennetta and Serb Dusan Vemic 6-4, 6-4 in 74 minutes to set up a quarter final clash with seventh seed Rennae Stubbs of Australia and Robert Lindstedt of Sweden.         
	Bhupathi and Huber were a bit sluggish with their service as they committed five double faults compared to their rivals one but the top seeds more than made up by converting all four break-points which came their way. They also defended six out of seven break points in the process.         
	Paes and Black, on their part, played compact tennis to see through their opponents challenge. Even though Pennetta and Venic managed to break them once in the first set, Paes and Black hit back, converting two of the four break points that came their way to go one up in 33 minutes.         
	The second set was an intense affair with both the pairs going neck-and-neck. Paes and Black did not find going easy but they still managed to break their opponents once which proved decisive in the end.

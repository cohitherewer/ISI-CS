The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhonis top spot under threat
                                                   Dhonis top spot under threat
                      
	 Calcutta: Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhonis numero uno status in the ICC Player Rankings for ODI batsmen is under threat as few good knocks from West Indies captain Chris Gayle or Shivnarine Chanderpaul in the upcoming England series may topple him from the top spot.         
	Dhoni is currently the only batsman above the 800-point mark but Gayle is not too far behind as he trails the Indian by 33 points. Chanderpaul is another four points behind which means the order could potentially change with a couple of strong performances by the two West Indian cricketers.         
	However, failure of the pair would directly benefit the fourth-placed Yuvraj Singh of India and Australias Michael Hussey in fifth position who are waiting to pounce on any opportunity that comes their way.

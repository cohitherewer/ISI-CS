The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Six Indian athletes for Berlin
                                                   Six Indian athletes for Berlin
                      
	New Delhi: India will be represented by six athletes, including three women, in the World Athletics Championships to be held in Berlin from August 15-23.         
	Among the three men, Joseph Abraham (400m hurdles) and Babubhai Panocha (20km walk) attained the qualifying norm this year while Surendra Kumar (10,000m) achieved it last year.         
	Women discus throwers Krishna Poonia and Seema Antil also crossed the qualifying standard this season.         
	The only surprise in the team was that of heptathlete Susmita Singha Roy who has not been at her best this season after touching the qualifying standard last year. But Susmita apparently got the selectors nod since she is considered a good prospect for next years Commonwealth Games in Delhi.         
	Long jumper Anju Bobby George, who represented India in the last edition of the competition in Osaka in 2007, will not be taking part this time as she has not trained much after recovery from the injury sustained during Beijing Olympics.         
	The Athletics Federation of India ignored several athletes who had achieved qualifying standards but were either not competing because of injuries or their recent form had not been up to the mark.         
	In the last Championships in Osaka also, six athletes took part but only Anju Bobby George qualified for the final where she finished ninth with a jump of 6.53m.

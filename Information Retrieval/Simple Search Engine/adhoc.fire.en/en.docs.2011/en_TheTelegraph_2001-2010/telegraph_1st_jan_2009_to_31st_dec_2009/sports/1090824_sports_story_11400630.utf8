	Calcutta: In a bid to unearth talent and promote cricket in the districts, UltraPlus Steel, on Sunday, inaugurated its third coaching centre at Durgapur Cricket Club. It already has two centres in Calcutta and Siliguri.         
	The Durgapur clinic, run in association with the local municipality, has around 150 trainees and six coaches. Gopal Bose and Devang Gandhi were present during the inauguration and will visit the centre once a month.         
	Besides, the coaches from other centres will attend workshops in Calcutta to keep in touch with the latest techniques and bring uniformity in coaching.

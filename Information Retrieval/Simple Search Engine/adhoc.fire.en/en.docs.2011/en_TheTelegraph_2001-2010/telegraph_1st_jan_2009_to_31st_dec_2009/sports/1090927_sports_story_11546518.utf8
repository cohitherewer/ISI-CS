    - ICON APPEALS FOR GENEROUS DONATIONS OVER THE JOY WEEK             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            File picture of Sachin Tendulkar and family at the unveiling of his wax statue in Mumbai                                 
	Johannesburg: Sachin Tendulkar, The Joy of Giving Week brand ambassador has, through The Telegraph, appealed to people across borders to be generous with their donations.         
	The September 27-October 3 week has, in fact, already attracted donors from the world of business to films. Sachin will himself be turning coach for a day.         
	Speaking exclusively, Sachin said: Please donate with lots of joy... Contribute whatever you can from the bottom of your heart, nothing would be too little...         
	While this is The Weeks inaugural editon, Sachins daughter Sara, who turns 12 on October 12, set the ball rolling last year itself.         
	On her last birthday, Sara decided not to accept presents in kind, but requested friends to contribute the amount they wouldve spent in buying her gifts... The entire sum went towards a party for underprivileged children...         
	Neither (wife) Anjali nor I had suggested that Sara do something of that kind... She did it of her own accord and we were touched... Sara wishes to continue doing that and, obviously, were happy, Sachin remarked.         
	The proceeds from the auction (on eBay) for a day of coaching from Sachin will, as reported in these columns on September 20, go to the Mumbai-based Apnalaya.         
	Sachin and his family have been associated with Apnalaya, an NGO which works for underprivileged children, for a number of years.         
	Meanwhile, a media release on behalf of The Week from GiveIndia (the coordinating NGO) has quoted Sachin as saying: I will spend quality time with the person or team that bids generously. All the money is going to a good cause.         
	I will reciprocate by offering serious cricketing tips, besides suitable photo opportunities. I will end the camp by having lunch with the participants.         
	Wow!

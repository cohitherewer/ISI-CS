                                                   A struggle to the top
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Deepika Kumaris achievement at the 11th Youth World Archery Championship in the US, where she bagged a gold in the cadet recurve womens event, is incredible not because she was the lone Indian in the final round of the world meet, but also because of the struggle she went through in her quest for glory.         
	Deepika, a 15-year-old from Jharkhand, is the daughter of Shiv Narayan Mahato, an auto driver in Ranchi. Her mother is a nurse in the government hospital.         
	A student of class XI, Deepika, had a brief exposure in archery at the Saraikela-Kharsawan Archery Association and later joined the Saraikela Kharsawan Archery Academy Dugni in 2007.         
	She joined the Tata Archery Academy in 2008. Deepika bagged the sub-junior and senior national titles in the same year. On her way to the title, she defeated Dola Bannerjee in the semi-finals.         
	She shot to the international arena in 2008 when she represented India in Cadet and Junior World Archery championship in Turkey. She then donned the national colours in Asian Archery Grand Prix in Bangkok where she won a silver medal in the team event.         
	Deepika was felicitated by Tata Steel in Jamshedpur Thursday.         
	At World Youth Archery final, she opened up a 6 point lead (86-80) going into the last end of three arrows which helped her achieve the historic feat.

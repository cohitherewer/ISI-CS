                                                   Sachin rates current India batting line-up as the best
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Christchurch: Sachin Tendulkar, on Sunday, rated the current Indian batting line-up as the best he has been part of. I would definitely say so, Tendulkar said in reply to a query at the post-match press conference.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	First ODI 100 in New Zealand         
	I started opening in 1994 here and got close to it around that period. The next tour was in 2002-03 where I missed out on a few matches because of an ankle injury. I have not played that many number of games here. I got close to scoring hundreds here, but didnt manage to. It is better late than never.         
	Having forced to retire hurt and not getting to 200         
	Towards the end I was hopeful that I could get a double hundred if I stay there till the 50th over. It was in the vicinity The previous game I got hit in my abs and the muscle was quite sore today.         
	The decision to retire         
	When I was batting around 65, I started feeling stiffness there. But towards the latter half of my innings, I started getting a twitch, and it kept getting worse. And I knew that I was effectively damaging it and I had reached a stage when I couldnt go on.         
	On his fitness         
	We will have to wait and see... We are going to have a look at it tomorrow.         
	If happy with the way he timed the ball today (Sunday)         
	In the last match also I played certain shots I was pleased with. Because the rain interrupted I lost my momentum. In a shortened game you have to start rethinking about the strategy and the target. Because of that I played a shot that I wouldnt have normally done. I knew I have striking the ball well and it was just a matter of spending more time and playing more number of balls.         
	If he has changed his approach to the game         
	It depends on the momentum. When Sehwag is batting obviously one guy is taking more chances than the other guy. It is sensible to hang a bit and let him play the big shots and rotate the strike. That is his strength and we have worked out a strategy. It has worked so far. When I am striking the ball well, I will be playing my shots. It is not that I am looking to block. If I get a loose ball at the initial part of the innings, I will put it away.         
	If this is the best batting line-up in one-day cricket in recent times         
	I would definitely say so. Weve got almost five or six guys who can clear the ropes at will. If you have good four or five overs in a row, we could end up scoring a huge total. At the back of our minds, we know that with such an explosive line-up no target is impossible.         
	If the New Zealand start had the Indians worried         
	In a high scoring match like this a couple of guys need to go berserk and if the rest play around them you can achieve any target. The way Brendon McCullum and Jesse Ryder batted initially they looked very much in control but we came back in the game quite well.         
	The Indian bowling         
	We bowled well in patches. I am quite sure the bowlers will have a meeting and try to figure what went wrong and what has to be done. In a high-scoring match like this the batsmen will throw their bat around and take that extra bit of chance. This not a big ground as well and sometimes you can have a bad day. But towards the end, I think we could have done a little better.         
	The total Indians had in mind         
	We were not looking at a specific total. We basically wanted to play out the first spell and whenever we got a loose ball we managed to put it away. Once the seam became soft, the ball came nicely on to the bat. With shorter boundaries, there was always scope to come back into the game and strike the ball as hard as possible. With batsmen capable of hitting over the ropes, we knew that we could change the momentum of the game. It was just a matter of timing it correctly and we managed to do that.         
	The wickets here this time         
	The wickets are great Not only players, but the spectators are also enjoying it. Last time we came here it wasnt good for both the sides as the bowlers got false confidence and the batters were looking for technical problems which didnt exist. I have at least not played on tracks like those and it wouldnt be ideal for the spectators either.         
	On how he retains his motivation         
	It is just love for the game. It is as simple as that. I care about cricket. I care about playing for India. The rest of things come naturally. Once these two prime things are on your mind then the rest follow on its own. I never have the problem of getting motivated before I walk in to play. It has always been there.         
	On how he rates his innings         
	At one stage, we did not get too many runs. But the way we timed it and built the momentum was very satisfying. I would regard this as a very important innings. When you are making runs it gives you happiness. I dont believe in rating my innings.         
	Why he opted out of Twenty20         
	I opted out of the T20 teams as I felt I wasnt in a position to give my best and my body was not ready for it. The guys went and played brilliantly and I dont want to change that momentum.         
	If he is aiming for 50 hundreds         
	I am enjoying the game. I just want to go out an enjoy my game and not set any targets. While doing that if it happens well and good. The most important factor is to keep enjoying my game and keep winning games for India.         
	If he wants to play in the 2011 World Cup         
	As I said earlier I want to enjoy my game. That is still some time away. At this moment I want to concentrate on this tour. We will see what happens later.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dinesh banks on IPL experience
                                                   Dinesh banks on IPL experience
                      
	Chennai: Dinesh Karthik said he would use his IPL experience to do well at the ICC World Twenty20 after getting a place in the Indian squad, albeit as replacement for the injured Virender Sehwag.         
	Karthik said he was disappointed at being ignored initially.         
	Of course, I was disappointed when they decided not to take an additional wicketkeeper.         
	But now I am happy about the opportunity given to me. I am focused to perform to my potential, he said.         
	I have acquired greater experience after playing on different pitches and different weather conditions in South Africa during the IPL.         
	I have to put in those positives into performing better in World T20. I am eagerly looking forward to it, he added.         
	Karthik said he cherishes every opportunity to represent India.         
	 I always cherish playing for my country as it gives you greater joy. World T20 is a different platform compared to IPL, he said.         
	On replacing Sehwag, Karthik said the opener was beyond comparison. Karthik insisted he was focussed on contributing to the teams cause.         
	Sehwag is a great opening batsman. I do not think it is right to compare us.         
	My focus will be to put in all my efforts to fulfil the requirements of the team management, he said.         
	On adjusting to weather conditions and the pitches in England, Karthik said: I have played there before and adjusting to the conditions will not be a problem but it is too early to speak about pitches.

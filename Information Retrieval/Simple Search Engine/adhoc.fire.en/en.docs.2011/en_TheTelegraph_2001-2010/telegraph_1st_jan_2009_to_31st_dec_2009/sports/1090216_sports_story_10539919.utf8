The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Israeli Peer denied visa to Dubai
                                                     Israeli Peer denied visa to Dubai
                  Shahar Peer                     
	Dubai: Shahar Peer, a top Israeli tennis player was blocked from travelling to Dubai for a major womens tournament after being denied a visa, Tour organisers said Sunday.         
	Shahar Peer broke barriers last year in Qatar when she was the first Israeli woman to play in a WTA Tour tournament in the Gulf as the region tries to enhance its reputation as an international sports hub.         
	But the visa denial for the Dubai Tennis Championships could be a blow to the citys efforts at fostering an image of full openness in business, sports and other high-profile events.         
	Peer, ranked 48th, was told Sunday that her visa was denied by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), her brother and spokesman, Shlomi Peer said. She had been drawn to play 15th-seeded Anna Chakvetadze on Monday in the first round of the joint ATP and WTA event, which includes all the top-10 ranked womens players.         
	WTA chief executive Larry Scott said the Tour was deeply disappointed by the decision.         
	Peer has earned the right to play in the tournament and its regrettable that the UAE is denying her this right, Scott said in a statement.         
	The UAE has no diplomatic relations with Israel, but Israelis have entered the country for international sporting and business events using second-country passports.         
	On some occasions, Israeli passport holders have been allowed entry for meetings held by the United Nations or other international agencies.         
	It was not clear whether Peer was travelling on an Israeli passport. Emirates officials did not immediately respond for comment on the decision.         
	Peers brother said the 21-year-old player applied for a visa months in advance and was assured by tournament organisers that she would be allowed entry.         
	Peer and her family are obviously extremely upset and disappointed by the decision of the UAE and its impact on her personally and professionally, said the statement by Scott.         
	He said the tournament will open as scheduled on Sunday, but stressed that WTA tour officials will review appropriate future actions with regard to the future of the Dubai tournament.         
	 The WTA believes very strongly and has a clear rule and policy that no host country should deny a player the right to compete in a tournament for which she has qualified by ranking, Scott said.         
	Peer had planned to travel to Dubai from Thailand, where she lost in the semi-final of the Pattaya Open to eventual champion Vera Zvonareva of Russia on Saturday.         
	In Dubai, Japans Ayumi Morita will replace her. Peer is expected to return to Israel. She could not be reached for comment.         
	Last month, Peer was the focus of protests in New Zealand over Israels recent three-week offensive in the Gaza Strip. She was provided extra security at the ASB Classic tournament.         
	For the record, Peer partnered Sania Mirza to win the 2007 Bank of the West Classic.           (AP)

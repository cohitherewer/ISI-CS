The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Symonds fantastic, says Gilchrist
                                                     Symonds fantastic, says Gilchrist
                  Adam Gilchrist                     
	Kimberley: Andrew Symonds Indian Premier League (IPL) stint with the Deccan Chargers has got off to a fantastic start, said captain Adam Gilchrist, hoping that the T20 event would be an enjoyable break for the troubled all-rounder battling to revive his international career.         
	Fantastic, we were obviously very keen to welcome back into the fold. And he sort of started it beautifully and showed the class that the whole world has seen so often. This will be an enjoyable little period for him, just to be able play some cricket in a different environment, Gilchrist said after Symonds IPL season II debut against Kings XI Punjab on Saturday.         
	Symonds, who has been told by Cricket Australia (CA) to prove that he is a reformed man after a string of alcohol-related misdemeanours, scored a 36-ball 60 Saturday.         
	But his effort could not clinch the match for Deccan as Kings XI Punjab pulled off a thrilling three-wicket win. Gilchrist said it was a frustrating loss.         
	We should have closed that game out. Its frustrating, but another great game of cricket. But certainly one that we let get away from us, he said.         
	But he refused to blame his bowlers for not being able to defend a reasonable 169. Asked if he was concerned about the bowling, the wicket-keeper batsman said, No no no. You sit back at the end of the day and you look at the stats and you can wonder maybe...if...but you cant live in that maybe. They have all done a very good job those guys. But just the way the game was going the options we made at that time were getting us into the game, he added.         
	Asked whether the next game against the Rajasthan Royals becomes crucial, Gilchrist said, That wouldnt mean anything different. It means that every game we go into, we got to go in with an intention of winning. Its still so tight, the competition is still so close.         
	I dont think any team walks away knowing that they are more secure, or knowing that they have a very good chance of making the semi-finals. Its still so even, nothing changes. Whether we won or lost today, we approach Monday in the same way that we are going to try and improve in those areas and keep trying to get that result, he added.

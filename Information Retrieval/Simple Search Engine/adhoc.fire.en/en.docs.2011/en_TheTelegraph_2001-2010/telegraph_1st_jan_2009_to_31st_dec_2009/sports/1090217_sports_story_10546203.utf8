	Calcutta: Bengal are all set to include Debabrata Das in the playing XI when they face Assam in their second match of the East Zone National one-dayers at the Eden on Tuesday.         
	Debabrata, who had to sit out in the opening tie against Jharkhand on Sunday owing to a miscommunication between the team management, will replace pacer Sourav Sarkar in the team.         
	If thats the case, hosts Bengal, who played four pacers and a spinner against Jharkhand, will include three fast bowlers  Ranadeb Bose, Ashok Dinda and Avik Chowdhury  and spinner Iresh Saxena for Tuesdays match.         
	Abhishek Banerjee, who opened with wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha and scored only 13 in the last match, will get another chance on Tuesday.         
	Sourav Ganguly will bat at number three while Manoj Tiwary and captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla will go in at number four and five respectively. The 22-year old Debabrata will follow at number six.         
	Debabrata is our natural choice and he will definitely play on Tuesday in which case Sourav Sarkar will have to sit out, chief selector Sambaran Banerjee said on Monday.         
	According to Banerjee, it would be injustice to drop opener Abhishek after only one innings.         
	Asked about Bengals strategy for the match against Assam, a cautious Shukla said: The Debabrata issue was a mistake A bad mistake... But its past now We want to look forward and tomorrow it will be a different day. Yes, Debabrata will be there in the team and I feel Sourav Sarkar will be rested.         
	Coach Utpal Chatterjee was not present during Bengals practice on Monday, owing to his office cricket commitments. A full-strength Bengal squad practised at the Eden for about two hours.         
	Former India captain Sourav spent about an hour at the nets and was seen imparting some batting tips to Shukla.         
	Assam is a good side Though they have lost against Tripura, we dont want to take any chances. We will play for a win. Dadi looked in good touch Manoj also appeared raring to go and the bowlers are looking in good form So I feel we have an advantage tomorrow, the Bengal captain said.                   Rashmi Ranjan Parida at the Eden on Monday      
	Assam are keen to go all out against their much-fancied opponents. According to Assam captain Rashmi Ranjan Parida, the pressure will be on Bengal as they are playing on their home ground and a lot are expected of them.         
	I hope it will be a good match Bengal are playing on home ground and being the best team in the East Zone, they will feel the pressure, Parida said.         
	Assam, who lost to Tripura by 29 runs on Sunday, will play three seamers. According to the Assam captain, the team will see a few changes from the last match.         
	Dhiraj Goswami, Krishna Das and Arup Das will be the three pacers to take the field on Tuesday. Dhiraj, who took four wickets on Sunday against Tripura, will be the bowler to look out. Bikram Chetri, who bowls left-arm spin, will be the only slow bowler.         
	After having a look at the Eden pitch, we have decided to play three seamers I feel that will help There will be a couple of changes in the team also, Praida said.         
	In another match, at the Jadavpur University Salt Lake campus ground, Shiv Sunder Das will lead Orissa against Tripura. Experienced Debasish Mohanty will lead the pace battery.

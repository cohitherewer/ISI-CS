                                                     Challengers stun Super Kings
                  Hayden                     
	Durban: The Royal Challengers Bangalore humbled their fancied opponents the Chennai Super Kings by two wickets in an Indian Premier League thriller to inject some life in their bid for a semi-final berth here on Thursday.         
	Following Mahendra Singh Dhonis decision to bat first, the Chennai Super Kings posted a modest 129, built largely around Matthew Haydens breezy 38-ball 60 but the Bangalore side overwhelmed the target with two balls to spare.         
	For the winners, New Zealander Ross Taylor cracked a sedate 50-ball 46 and added 56 runs with Virat Kohli (38 off 35) to fashion their second consecutive victory.         
	With five runs needed from the last over, Taylor fell to Jacob Oram but R. Vinay Kumar kept his cool and hit a four to seal the issue.         
	Earlier, the Super Kings opener Hayden, who adorned his innings with five fours and three sixes, did not find enough support from his colleagues as only two other batsmen  Suresh Raina (13) and skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (18)  managed double digit scores.         
	The Super Kings lost their six wickets for only 28 runs with Oram (7), S. Badrinath (2) and Albie Morkel (7) falling cheaply.         
	Hayden looked at his best and cracked three boundaries in the second over off medium pacer R. Vinay Kumar and then smote Praveen Kumar into the stands in the next over.         
	Anil Kumble brought South African Jacques Kallis into the attack in the fourth over and the all-rounder justified his skippers decision by inflicting the first blow to the Super Kings, sending back opener M. Vijay (5) cheaply.         
	Kallis struck again in the sixth over when Raina failed to negotiate a rising delivery and Van der Merwe dived forward to pouch a well judged catch.         
	Dhoni then paired up with Hayden, who was looking solid at the other end, to stitch a 45-run partnership.         
	Spinner Merwe broke the pair, just when they were looking dangerous, by brilliantly taking a reflex catch to remove Dhoni (18 off 20).         
	Kumble got the big breakthrough when Hayden failed to gauge a floater and Vinay pouched a good catch near the ropes.         
	Once Hayden returned, none of the Super Kings batsmen could do much as the side settled for a below-par total.         
	Chasing a modest 130, the Royal Challengers got off to a disastrous start as the Super Kings new-ball pair of Albie Morkel and Sudeep Tyagi struck early in the innings.         
	Opener Kallis (0) departed after falling leg before to Morkel, while in the next over Rahul Dravids (8) ambitious cut found Badrinath at backward point, leaving the Royal Challengers struggling at 12 for two. Robin Uthappa (6) also departed cheaply after being given lbw off Morkel in the fifth over.         
	The Super Kings maintained a strict line and length to stifle the Bangalore top-order but ran out of steam as the match progressed.         
	Taylor and Kohli held their nerve and paired up to pull the Royal Challengers out of the pit before Oram caught Kohli off Lakshmipathy Balaji.         
	Experienced Mark Boucher (5) also could not carry the flag and fell prey to Muttiah Muralidharan but Vinay Kumar did not make any mistake, guiding the side to a thrilling win.

                  Brittany Lincicome                     
	Rancho Mirage (California): Brittany Lincicome won her first major title in spectacular style at the Kraft Nabisco Championship on Sunday, eagling the par-five last to triumph by one shot.         
	The long-hitting American powered a booming drive down the middle before hitting a superb hybrid club to four feet on the 18th green and calmly sinking the putt for a closing three-under-par 69.         
	Lincicome, who had never led in the final round until the 72nd hole, trailed by three early on before her grandstand finish gave her a nine-under total of 279.         
	After her winning putt dropped, she pumped her right fist in celebration before embracing her compatriot and good friend Kristy McPherson, the third-round leader who was one stroke in front teeing off at the last.         
	Former US Womens Open champion Cristie Kerr, three ahead of the chasing pack early on in the round, closed with a 71 to share second place with McPherson (72).         
	For much of a sun-baked day in the California desert it seemed the experienced Kerr would go on to win her second major title in a final-round duel with McPherson.         
	A stroke off the pace overnight, she made a fast start with birdies at the second and fourth to forge three ahead after five holes.         
	McPherson, who had stumbled with bogeys at the second and fifth, began to work her way back into contention, birdies at the seventh and ninth lifting her to within a stroke of the lead.         
	Both players recorded three-putt bogeys at the 13th but Kerr regained control at the par-three 14th. One ahead at nine under, Kerrs title bid effectively ended at the 15th.         
	McPherson narrowly missed a birdie attempt from eight feet at the par-three 17th.         
	Australian Lindsey Wright signed off with a 70 to finish fourth at six under, a stroke in front of Norways Suzann Pettersen (66) and American Meaghan Francella (69).

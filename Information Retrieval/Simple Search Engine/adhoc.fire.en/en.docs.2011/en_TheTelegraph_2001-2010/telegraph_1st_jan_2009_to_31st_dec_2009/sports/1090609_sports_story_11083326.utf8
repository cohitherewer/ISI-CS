The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhaichung can seek IFA help
                                                   Bhaichung can seek IFA help
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The six-month suspension served on Bhaichung Bhutia by Mohun Bagan has put the footballer on the back foot. It could, however, only be a temporary setback for the national captain.         
	According to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources the only way out for Bhaichung to defuse the situation is to approach IFA, the parent body of Bengal football.         
	For all practical purposes, only the IFA can help Bhaichung to take the matter to the Players Status Committee of the AIFF, said a source, who did not wish to be named.         
	The federation cannot bypass the state association and entertain any request for justice from the footballer. Let Bhaichung write to the IFA, which in turn can refer the matter to the national federation. In that case, the AIFF will have no problem in taking up the matter, he said.         
	But well-placed sources asserted that Bagan, who played their cards carefully in suspending the most famous name in Indian football, may have acted against the spirit of football.         
	Bhaichung can use it to his own advantage, the official pointed out. Fifa does not like any action which stops a professional footballer from pursuing his career unless there are serious charges of criminal or drug-related activities. He can always stress this point and get himself free to play the game even before the matter is settled, the official said.         
	Bhaichung was not ready to have any dialogue with Bagan but the suspension has now made it mandatory for him to write to the club. All he can do is to send a copy to the IFA, said an official.         
	Bagan have not made the letter of suspension public but one is quite sure they have dealt at length on his alleged absence from practice sessions. There must be a clause in his contract that calls for action for missing practice session.         
	It is a normal thing for a professional footballer but the club is bent upon to take advantage of it. The idea must be to harass the footballer as much as possible, he said.

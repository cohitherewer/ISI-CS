	Calcutta: Chirag United will look to maintain their winning streak when they take on Air India in an I-League encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. Chirag have so far won both their matches against Mohun Bagan and Mumbai FC.         
	That the differences between the club management and coach Subrata Bhattacharya have been sorted out amicably has also come as a relief to the footballers.         
	Refusing to elaborate, Bhattacharya said they were a confident lot. I dont want to talk about what happened. We are responsible enough, the boys are confident and will look forward to another win, Bhattacharya said after joining practice following a days absence.         
	We will have to be calculative as Air India have been performing well for the last 10 years, Bhattacharya said.         
	United will be relying on the striker prowess of Edmilson and guile of Joshimar. They will, however, be without Subhasish Roy Chowdhury because of a double booking.         
	But Eduardo will return after recovering from an injury to bolster the defence against Air India who will bank on Nigerian import ND Opara and Dada Nabeel.

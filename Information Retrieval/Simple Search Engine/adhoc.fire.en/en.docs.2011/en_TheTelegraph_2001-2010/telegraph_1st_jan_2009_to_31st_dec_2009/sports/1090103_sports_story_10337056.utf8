                                                   Team not short on motivation: Smith 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The series may have been won but with a rare opportunity to whitewash Australia, South Africa skipper Graeme Smith on Friday said his team remains motivated for the third and final Test starting in Sydney Saturday, according to information forwarded by Cricket South Africa.         
	It is quite difficult when the first two Tests have had such great moments but I look around me and the squad appears very calm. Each bloke is hungry for a good performance. They either want to score a big hundred or take five wickets. We want to win and there is a real motivation to win the series 3-0. That opportunity hasnt come around very often for teams against Australia, Smith said ahead of the match.         
	The team is motivated and I think there is a lot of individual motivation as well. The guys want to win and put in big performances, he added.         
	Naming an unchanged XI, Smith said: Ashwell Prince was not considered for selection. He had a net Thursday and is still feeling pain in his thumb. He is hugely frustrated. In sport you cant predict these things.         
	He is extremely proud and happy about the way the team has performed. As vice-captain he has handled himself outstandingly in the environment and has been a great supporter of J.P., he added.         
	As a senior player you cant ask more of a player except to get on the field and perform and, when we get home, he knows the support he has got from us and the performances he has put in over a period of time and he will be right there to be in the reckoning to play in the Tests at home.         
	The Proteas lead the series 2-0 after dominating wins in Perth and Melbourne, and Smith said he is pleased not just for beating the world champions but also for causing unrest in their camp.         
	Throughout the series we have concentrated on what we can do rather than what the opposition has thrown at us but if we have caused a bit of uncertainty in their camp, then we will take that as a compliment that we have played well and met the challenges, he said.         
	I think we will take that as a bit of a feather in our cap.         
	Commenting on the new-look Aussie pace attack, which has two left-arm seamers in Mitchell Johnson and rookie Doug Bollinger, Smith said the latters selection came as a surprise.         
	It is unusual. Only India these days seem to have two left-handers around. Having Hilfenhaus in the squad for Melbourne and now going for Bollinger shows a certain lack of clarity in the selection process. That has surprised us. We know that it is his (Bollingers) home ground but I guess Hilfenhaus must feel a bit hard done by, Smith said.         
	We have got as much information (about Bollinger) as we can. Any guy who can give 150 per cent is somebody we are going to have to respect a bit! he quipped.         
	Smith said he was very happy with the preparation of the team, particularly the focus it has maintained leading into what is essentially a dead rubber.         
	Our two victories have shown up very much the frame of mind our guys are in. They have been very graceful in the victories they have had. They havent been over the top and they have been very respectful. I think that shows the mindset of the guys, he said.         
	There is obviously a huge amount of happiness to be arriving here in Sydney 2-0 up. I guess it doesnt really sink in and you just move ahead to the next challenge. The Sydney Test match is normally a great occasion and we know that there is still a lengthy summer ahead of us against Australia, he added.

            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hamilton: Lakshmipathy Balaji is looking forward to the Test series against New Zealand though the right-arm pacer is unlikely to get a chance to play in the first Test starting here on Wednesday.         
	Balaji said he was not being unduly anxious about it and was preparing to give his best whenever he gets an opportunity to prove his worth.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On how it feels to be back in the Indian side         
	Feeling good... I have worked very hard in the last two years and I am looking forward to the big series. Its good to be back in the side and I am enjoying the team atmosphere.         
	The practice matches in the New Zealand domestic circuit         
	It was a very good experience and exposure to get to know the conditions and the pitches. I think it was a very good move from the board that (VVS) Laxman and Rahul (Dravid), and everyone got a little bit of match practice before the Tests. It helped a lot.         
	The difference between wickets in Asia and New Zealand         
	In Asian wickets, you have got to hit the deck hard because the ball doesnt come on to the bat. The length is a little bit shorter in India. Here, the ball does a little bit if you bowl up. Even in the last one-day match in Auckland, the bowlers when they were bowling up were getting a little bit of movement off the wicket. It is very important to adjust the length here, bowl a bit fuller  not overpitched but a length where the batsman will be in two minds!         
	The wicket for the first Test         
	I have not seen the wicket. A bowler will look to bowl on any wicket,, whatever be the conditions. I am definitely looking forward to playing matches and bowling a lot.         
	The loss in the final game of the one-day series         
	The boys played really well. It happens when you go into a very high intensity game... You will lose a couple of matches when you play positive cricket, but ultimately we won the series. It has been a very good positive going into the Test series it will make a big difference.         
	The New Zealand side         
	They have been a very good side. They have beaten Australia and a couple of other big sides in the last couple of years. They have been a very good all-round side and its definitely a challenge to go up against them. At home, they are good, we know that. We will look to give them a good fight.         
	If he will play the first Test         
	No, I havent got any indication. Still one more day to go. I am just very relaxed, looking forward to whatever chance I get.

                                                   Foreigners have role to play: Bob 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: National coach Bob Houghton feels that foreign players in India play an important role in improving the standard of the game.         
	According to him, apart from adding to the spectators interest, the presence of foreigners also allows the Indian footballers to play against physically superior opponents.         
	Houghton, who for a long time has been campaigning to add more clubs and local players in the I-League to spread the game across the country, admitted it wont be easy turning domestic football into a foreigner-free circuit.         
	Because I am the national coach, I will be happy if there are more local players in the club sides, Houghton told the AIFF website on Friday.         
	You have to accept that clubs love foreigners because they give fans a bit more interest. I suppose one thing that the foreigners do for us is that they make us aware of the size of the players we are going to play against.

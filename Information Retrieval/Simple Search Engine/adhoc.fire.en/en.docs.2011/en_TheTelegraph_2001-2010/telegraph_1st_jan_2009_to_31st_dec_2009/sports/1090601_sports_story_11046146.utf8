The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Limba wary of Korean threat
                                                   Limba wary of Korean threat
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Coach Limba Ram feels that Korea will be Indias prime competitor in the World Cup stage III slated to commence Tuesday in Antalya, Turkey.         
	I expect a good fight from the Koreans. Although all countries will put in their best, I am particularly cautious about Korea, Limba told The Telegraph before leaving for Turkey.         
	They (the Koreans) have new players in the squad Players who are unknown and I am sure they will be very good, the coach added.         
	Talking about his tactics, Limba said that a cautious approach and a positive mindset would help his boys to keep up the momentum.         
	I am sure that the boys will do good there. They are high on confidence and everybody is in good form. I am 95 per cent sure that we will win gold this time too, Limba said.         
	Jayanta Talukdar, individual gold winner in Croatia, echoed Limba. Yes, Korea will give us good competition in the team event. They have a different squad from the one that played in Croatia and I have heard these guys are better. But our preparations are fantastic and I am hopeful that if we can repeat what we did in the practice session nobody would be able to stop us from winning gold this time also, he said.         
	We have played in Antalya several times and are familiar with the conditions So I believe there will be no problem. We just need a good start and that will be enough for a good result.         
	Incidentally, the Indian recurve team bagged gold both at the World Cup stage II (in Croatia) and stage I (in Dominican Republic) earlier this year. Last year in Turkey they grabbed a gold in the same event.         
	Asked how confident he was of repeating his gold winning show in Antalya, Jayanta said: Look, Rahul (Banerjee), Mangal (Singh Champia), and myself, all of us are in really good shape and all of us have a chance of winning gold in Turkey.         
	Olympian Champia and Bengal lad Rahul both sounded hopeful of continuing the momentum in Antalya.         
	Dola Banerjee too hoped that the womens team has a good chance of winning a medal in Turkey. We are hopeful. We just need to remain focused and go on delivering our best.

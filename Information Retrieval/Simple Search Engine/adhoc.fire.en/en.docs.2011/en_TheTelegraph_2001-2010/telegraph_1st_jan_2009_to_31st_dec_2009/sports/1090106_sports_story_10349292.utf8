	Chennai: Sachin Tendulkar braved fever to hit 122 while captain Wasim Jaffer smashed 301 to help Mumbai to a mammoth 637 for six on the second day of their four-day Ranji Trophy cricket semi-final against Saurashtra here on Monday.         
	Tendulkar, who faced 166 balls for his knock, retired perhaps not being able to withstand the heat in the middle.         
	The batting maestro stitched a 226-run stand off 410 balls with Jaffer.         
	At close, Abhishek Nayar (29) and Ramesh Powar (8) were at the crease.         
	Jaffer amassed his second triple century (301, 459b, 635m, 27x4) against Saurashtra this season.         
	After spending 635 minutes at the crease, Jaffer was out to a tired looking shot.         
	He tried playing Rakesh Dhruve towards on-side but the ball took the leading edge of his bat and went straight back to the bowler.         
	Jaffer continued to be in his elements in the company of Tendulkar, who showed aggression from the word go and kept the scoreboard ticking at a faster pace.         
	Walking out to bat at the fall of Ajinkya Rahane (85), Tendulkar enthralled the sparse crowd with his attacking batting.         
	Rahane was batting sensibly and was advancing well towards his century but he holed out to Kotak as he stepped out off Makwanas bowling.                     
	From there on, Jaffer and Tendulkar made sure that they stayed at the crease to take Mumbai to a huge first innings score.         
	Jaffer played a perfect captains knock and his teammates came out to celebrate his triple century. Jaffer got to the coveted mark with a push through cover point for a single off Dhruve.         
	Amol Muzumdar, who required 42 runs to become the highest run-getter in the history of Ranji Trophy, failed when he nicked Balakrishna Jadeja to wicket-keeper Jogiyani.         
	Rohit Sharma was adjudged leg before off B. Jadeja for 28 and Ajit Agarkar also got out with just two runs to his credit.         
	Brief scores: Mumbai 637/6 (W. Jaffer 301, S. Tendulkar 122 retd hurt) vs Saurashtra. Match to continue.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL in SA wont be the same: Ramiz
                                                   IPL in SA wont be the same: Ramiz
                      
	Karachi: Waqar Younis and Ramiz Raja believe that the Indian Premier League (IPL) has lost some of its charm this season due to the absence of Pakistani cricketers from its second edition and the events relocation to South Africa.         
	The former Pakistan captains were of the view that the cash-rich Twenty20 event will suffer due to its relocation out of India as fans back home identified themselves with their respective city teams.         
	I have no doubt that the IPL still remains a top event but because it is being held in South Africa, it will take some time before the tournament gains momentum this time, Ramiz said. It will take time before fans in South Africa start identifying themselves with the teams.         
	Ramiz had no doubt that the league had helped Indian cricket immensely in many ways. Playing alongside and against top international players has given Indian players a lot of confidence and this can be seen in their performances now, he said.         
	He was of the view that the IPL and the Pakistan-Australia series in Emirates would be a welcome relief to the Pakistani people, who have been living their lives in a volatile security situation.         
	Cricket will be a welcome relief and distraction for them. And I think the series with Australia will bring a lot of viewership and interest, he said, adding, after the Australia series, people will turn to the IPL which would have gained momentum by then.         
	Waqar, on the other hand, said he had no doubt that the absence of Pakistani players from the IPL was a big blow to the event. Pakistani cricketers have always been a big pull among the Indian and international audiences and their absence would affect the event, he said.         
	Although the former Pakistan speedster said the advent of IPL had brought a revolution in cricket, he feels the newest form of the game can never replace Tests and ODIs.         
	Twenty20 cricket is pure entertainment and it is good for the sport but on the long run, I dont think it will replace Tests or ODIs, he said.         
	Meanwhile, IPL has asked its legal advisors to look into the demands of the Pakistani cricketers regarding their payment row with their respective franschise.           (PTI)

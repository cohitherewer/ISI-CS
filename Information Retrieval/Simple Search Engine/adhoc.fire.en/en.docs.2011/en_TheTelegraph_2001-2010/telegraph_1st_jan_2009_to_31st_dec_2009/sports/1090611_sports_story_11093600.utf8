	Nottingham: Sanath Jayasuriya and Tillekaratne Dilshan put on an opening stand of 124 Wednesday to lead Sri Lanka to a 15-run win over the West Indies in a meaningless Twenty20 World Cup game.         
	Jayasuriya smashed 81 in 47 balls and Dilshan 74 also from 47 deliveries, flaying West Indies bowlers to all parts of Trent Bridge as Sri Lanka posted 192 for five.         
	Lendl Simmons, who took four for 19, was the only bowler to avoid punishment, with Sri Lanka hitting 23 fours and six sixes.                   
	Simmons then made 29 with the bat, but only Dwayne Bravo (51) scored more as the West Indies closed on 177 for five. Both sides had already qualified from Group C for the Super Eight phase, which begins Thursday.         
	Despite the early loss of Andre Fletcher, bowled by Lasith Malinga in the fourth over for 13, the West Indies made a promising start to the chase, racing to 55 for one after five overs. However, when Simmons was brilliantly caught at first slip by Mahela Jayawardene off Muttiah Muralidharan in the seventh over, it brought a collapse.         
	Xavier Marshall miscued a delivery from Ajantha Mendis straight to Chamara Silva, and Mendis then bowled Shivnarine Chanderpaul for the third wicket in seven balls to leave the West Indies on 73 for four in the eight over.         
	Soon after, Muralidharan caught Bravo but, realising he was about to fall over the boundary rope and concede a six, he flicked the ball backward to save two runs.                   
	Angelo Mathews later produced an even more acrobatic piece of fielding, clawing the ball back from well behind the rope to prevent a six and save three runs. Light rain began to fall, but the West Indies  well behind on run rate  were obliged to bat on. Bravo and Ramnaresh Sarwan made a half-century stand, but took 44 balls to do it, meaning the team needed 72 with five overs left.         
	Muralidharan could even afford to drop Bravo in the 17th as he was caught in the next over by Jehan Mubarak off Malinga. Needing 28 off the last over, West Indies couldnt work a miracle. The West Indies captain Denesh Ramdin  standing in for the rested Chris Gayle  will regret asking Sri Lanka to bat after winning the toss.         
	Fidel Edwards conceded 17 off the second over and Kieron Pollards first over went for 19 as Jayasuriya raced to 50 off 29 balls. The Sri Lankans offered few chances until Dilshan was dropped by Sulieman Benn in the 12th over and they were aided by some comically bad fielding. Jayasuriya was finally out lbw to Simmons in the 13th over and Kumar Sangakkara made five.         
	Meanwhile, the West Indies have been fined for maintaining a slow over-rate. Match Referee Chris Broad imposed the fine after the Caribbeans were ruled to be two overs short of their target at the end of the Sri Lanka innings.

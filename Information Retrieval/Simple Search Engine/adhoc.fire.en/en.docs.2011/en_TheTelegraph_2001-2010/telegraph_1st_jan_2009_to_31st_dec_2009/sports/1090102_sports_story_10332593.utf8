The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ricky looks to other teams for ideas
                                                   Ricky looks to other teams for ideas

	Melbourne: Australia skipper Ricky Ponting feels they have to turn to other teams in a search for fresh ideas if they are to avoid a series whitewash for the first time in 132 years of Test cricket history.         
	Things are going to be different and we have to look at different ways of going about things, Ponting said.         
	We cant sit back as leaders and coaches and keep doing the same thing because it hasnt been working for us. We have to learn from the way other teams are going about things as well. Thats not something were accustomed to. Other teams have been looking at us for 10 or 12 years.         
	Now its our turn to have a look at what other teams are doing with their strategies and tactics, said the under-fire skipper. But for the moment, Ponting said he and the coaching staff have to ensure that Mitchell Johnson is not overloaded.         
	Mitchell has bowled a truck load of overs from the start of India so we have to start looking at his workload, Ponting was quoted as saying in an Australian daily.         
	With Brett Lee injured, it will depend on Johnson to shoulder responsibility with some fresh faces in the Sydney Test, starting on Saturday.         
	If we can get him (Johnson) through this next game with a couple of other fresher bowlers around him, that would be a good result for us. Then we can start looking at resting him.         
	Talking about the Boxing Day Test which Australia lost by nine wickets to concede a series defeat, Ponting said Lees injury on the third day, when South Africas last three wickets piled 275 runs, proved to be the turning point.         
	The reason we found it so difficult with Binga (Lee) going down in the last game was that the other guys we had to call on did not have much experience to fall back on, Ponting said.

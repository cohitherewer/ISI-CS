The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan keep winning run
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bagan keep winning run
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan maintained their all-win record in the CFL Premier Division defeating George Telegraph 1-0 at their club ground on Saturday. Nigerian Edeh Chidi scored the all-important goal in the 38th minute. This was Bagans fifth win in as many matches.         
	Bagan started well and dictated the proceedings for the first 45 minutes. The likes of Tomba Singh. Ishfaq Ahmed, Ryuki Sueoka and Chidi were all over their rivals and the chance of Bagan drawing the first blood was always there. Still they had to wait for 38 minutes mainly because the Bagan strikers failed once inside the penalty box.         
	After the breather, George coach Raghu Nandy made a change. He brought in Mithun Saha in place of a jet-lagged M. Francis, who came back from Nigeria only on Friday. George slowly started getting a foothold and soon it looked they would return with at least a point.         
	Their cause was also helped by the fact that Bagans Micky Fernandes was not giving enough effort at the centre of the park and that put pressure on the defence. Even his replacement Lalram Luah was a big flop and stand-in coach Mridul Banerjee had no option but to take him out too.         
	The goal came when Tomba Singh picked out Chidi inside the George half and the Nigerian in a half-turn got past his marker. His grounder hit the bulls eye much to the delight of the crowd. Goalkeeper Swarup Das could have done a better job as Chidis attempt did not have enough power.

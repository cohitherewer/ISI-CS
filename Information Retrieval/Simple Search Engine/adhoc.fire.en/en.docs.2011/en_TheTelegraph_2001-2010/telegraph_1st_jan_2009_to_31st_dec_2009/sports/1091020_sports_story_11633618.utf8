The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sandeep stars as India seal series
                                                   Sandeep stars as India seal series
                      
	Surrey (Canada): Sandeep Singh continues with his rampaging form, scoring twice as India beat Canada 3-1 to take an unassailable 4-0 lead after the fifth match in the seven-match hockey Test series at the Tamanawis Park. India had won the first two matches and played a 4-4 draw in the third Test match before winning the fourth 2-0.         
	Sandeep struck in the 35th and 67th minutes after Gurwinder Chandi opened the scoring for the visitors in the 29th minute Sunday. David Jameson scored for Canada in the 41st minute.         
	Canada began aggressively, winning a penalty corner when Mark Pearson was stick-fouled by Sandeep. However, Scott Tuppers flick lacked sting.         
	On the other hand, India began tentatively and committed numerous unforced errors. Forwards Prabhjot Singh, captain Rajpal Singh, Sarwanjit Singh and Gurwinder Chandi were off colour and far from fluent.         
	Both teams earned two penalty corners in the first quarter but the scoreline remained unchanged as Sandeep and Raghunath were off target for India while Wayne Fernandess flick was saved by India keeper Adrian DSouza.         
	Indias opener came when Sardar Singh broke with great pace down the middle to set up Prabhjot. The Batala veteran tapped to Chandi who beat Carter under the bars with a wrong foot shot.         
	Chandi could have scored again but went too acute with his backhander, which went straight to Carter.         
	Indias second came at the stroke of half-time when Prabhjot was obstructed by Adam Froese and the resultant penalty corner was fired in by Sandeep.         
	The second half saw India excel in patches as Canada tried to reduce the margin. Connor Grimes orchestrated the attack in the 41st minute but found his attempt blocked feebly by DSouza, enabling David Jameson to scoop the rebound into the cage.

	 The Kolkata Knight Riderss camp is unlikely to be held at Eden Gardens from October 27-29. The camp clashes with Bengals practice matches before the Ranji Trophy season, and there was confusion over release of the state players.      
	The Knight Riders management has realised that it would be unrealistic to hold a T20 camp before the start of the first-class season. The CAB, though, was ready to discuss the issue. This is an issue which can be sorted out. We can always work out a solution regarding release of players, a senior CAB official said on Tuesday.      
	Meanwhile, the CAB has given Avishek Jhunjhunwala permission to take part in the Rajasthan Royals camp scheduled to begin from Tuesday in Ahmedabad. However, he has been asked to report back before Friday. Bengal are supposed to play a practice match on that day before the T20 meet in Dhanbad.          
	 Seventeen districts are taking part in the State and Inter-district Table Tennis Championship, which was inaugurated at Khudiram Anushilan Kendra on Monday. In mens action, North Calcutta beat Howrah 3-0 while East Calcutta beat Burdwan by the same margin.

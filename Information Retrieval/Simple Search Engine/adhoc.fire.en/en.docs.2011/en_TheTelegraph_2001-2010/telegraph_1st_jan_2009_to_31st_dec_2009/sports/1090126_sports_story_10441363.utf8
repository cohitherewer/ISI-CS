	Liverpool: Steven Gerrard salvaged a replay for Liverpool with a second half equaliser in a 1-1 draw against local rivals Everton while Arsenal had to settle for a 0-0 draw with Cardiff after a battling performance by the League Championship side in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Sunday.         
	Defender Joleon Lescott gave Everton the lead at Anfield with a close-range header from a corner in the 27th minute. But Gerrard levelled in the 54th minute with a powerful low shot after Fernando Torress audacious backheel flick had opened up the Everton defence.         
	The neighbours also drew 1-1 at Anfield in the Premier League on Monday.         
	Although Xabi Alonso sent a shot flashing across the face of the Everton goal after only 20 seconds, Liverpool didnt have the guile to open up the visiting teams defence in the first half.         
	Content to sit back in a rock solid defence and a crowded midfield, Everton had only one chance  from a set piece  and took it.         
	Victor Anichebe won a corner down the left, Steven Pienaar found Tim Cahill with his kick and the Australians header was diverted home by Lescott with the slightest movement of his head.         
	With Lescott and Phil Jagielka in control of Torres, Everton went into halftime comfortably holding onto their lead and, with Robbie Keane not even on the bench, it was hard to see where a Liverpool goal would come from. But Evertons defence was breached by a stunning piece of skill from Torres and a top-quality finish by Gerrard.         
	There seemed no danger when the ball was played through to Torres, 30-metres out and with his back to goal. But he flicked it through with the back of his heel to find Gerrard racing through and the Liverpool captain drove the ball low past Tim Howard with his left foot.         
	Two minutes later Liverpool were almost ahead but Gerrards shot was acrobatically pushed over the bar by the American goalkeeper.         
	Dirk Kuyt wasted a chance to fire a second for Liverpool when Gerrard found him unmarked on a counter attack 10 minutes from time but the Dutch forward shot tamely into Howards hands.         
	Cardiff, last seasons runners-up, had several chances in the early stages and nearly snatched a late victory when Ross McCormack clipped the crossbar from 25 metres in the last three minutes.         
	They had two or three good chances and it was uncomfortable because they had some good crosses and in the box they were always present, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said.         
	In the second half they defended deeper, we were more dominant, but I felt the quality of their defending, and a little bit the pitch as well, stopped us from finding a hole in their defence and that explains the 0-0.         
	The draw forced a replay at Arsenals Emirates Stadium on February 3.         
	Cardiff, pushing for promotion, get another chance to test their credentials against Premier League opposition and to earn extra revenue.         
	Returning to the city where they beat Manchester United in the 2005 final, the Gunners were fortunate that their hosts were so wasteful in front of goal  particularly in the opening 20 minutes.         
	New Cardiff signing Chris Burkes shot was blocked by Arsenal captain Kolo Toure and fellow Scot McCormack headed wide for Cardiff, which lost to Portsmouth in the final last May.         
	When Arsenals former Cardiff midfielder Aaron Ramsey lost possession, Jay Bothroyd, who switched teams in the opposite direction, picked up the ball and unleashed a fierce strike from 30 metres that flew over.

	Cincinnati: Roger Federer struggled in blustery conditions to overcome David Ferrer of Spain 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to reach the quarter finals of the $3 million ATP Cincinnati Masters on Thursday.         
	The third-round victory left the Swiss star relieved he was still around.         
	However, Leander Paes and his Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy were ousted in the second round by the unseeded Spanish pair of Ferrer and Tommy Robredo. The third seed Indo-Czech pair looked out-of-sorts in the match as the Spanish duo comprehensively beat them 2-6, 4-6 to qualify for the quarter finals.         
	Ferrer and Robredo will next face eight seeded Polish-Austrian pair of Lukas Kubot and Oliver Marach, who defeated wildcard holders John Isner and Sam Querrey of the US 4-6, 6-2, 10-8.         
	Meanwhile, the other Indian in the fray, Mahesh Bhupathi and his partner Mark Knowles have already advanced to the quarter finals of the event and the fourth seed Indo-Bahamian combination will take on French duo of Michael Llodra and Jo-Wilfried Songa.         
	Second-ranked Andy Murray was much sharper under the conditions, beating Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic 6-4, 6-1. Murray kept the ball in play, had only 14 unforced errors and was broken only one time.         
	No. 4 Novak Djokovic beat Jeremy Chardy of France 7-5, 6-3.         
	Unseeded Lleyton Hewitt edged Sam Querrey of the US 6-1, 2-6, 6-3 to line up Federer next.         
	Following his post-match interview, Federer swatted some souvenir balls into the stands  well, all but one that flew out of the stadium, demonstrating what the players had been up against. Every mistake was magnified.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Paine to replace Haddin
                                                     Paine to replace Haddin
            A STAFF REPORTER            Brad Haddin                           
	Calcutta: The Champions Trophy technical committee Thursday approved changes in the West Indies and the Australia squads for the event which is to be held in South Africa later this month, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said in a release.         
	Thus, Kevin McClean will replace Daren Powell in the Windies squad while Tim Paine will replace Brad Haddin in the Australian side.         
	Haddin has had to undergo surgery on the ring finger of his left hand for the injury picked up during the Ashes and will continue his recovery.         
	While it is extremely disappointing to miss the Champions Trophy, the good news is that the surgery was successful and my finger will be 100 per cent when the recovery period is over, Haddin said.         
	I am aiming to be available for selection for the one-day series in India. However, this is a decision that will be made in consultation with the CA medical staff when its time, he added.

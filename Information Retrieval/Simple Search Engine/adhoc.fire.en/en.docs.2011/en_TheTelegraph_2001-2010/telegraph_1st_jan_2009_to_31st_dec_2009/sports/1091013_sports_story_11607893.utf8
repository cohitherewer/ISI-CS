                                                     Bravo powers T amp;T to victory
                  Dwayne Bravo celebrates in Bangalore on Monday                     
	Bangalore: Dwayne Bravo starred with a four-wicket haul as Trinidad amp; Tobago thrashed Somerset Sabres by 44 runs in a Group A match to begin their Champions League campaign on a high note here Monday.         
	The Caribbean side, opting to bat first, scored 150 for nine and then bowled out the English county side for 106 off the last ball of the match.         
	The Sabres, who now have one win and a loss from their group engagements, will have to pray that Trinidad and Tobago beat the Deccan Chargers in their next match. Bravo jolted the English innings with his early two-wicket burst to give his side a good start and took the last two wickets in the final over of the game.         
	Sherwin Ganga, who had played a crucial unbeaten 18-run cameo, also did his bit with the ball, taking two wickets. He was named the Man of the Match. Dave Mohammed (2/18) was the other notable contributor in the victory of the Caribbean side.

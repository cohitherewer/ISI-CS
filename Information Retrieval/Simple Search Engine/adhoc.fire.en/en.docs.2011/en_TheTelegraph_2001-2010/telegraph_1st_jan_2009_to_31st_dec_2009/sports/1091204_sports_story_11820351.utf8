The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Taylor trouble for the Windies
                                                                                                                       7                                      Taylor trouble for the Windies
                      
	Adelaide: The West Indies, having lost the first Test against Australia, are in fresh trouble on the eve of their second Test which begins here Friday.         
	According to cricinfo, strike bowler Jerome Taylor has been ruled out of the rest of the series with a back injury, leaving an already young and developing attack even greener.         
	Opener Adrian Baraths impressive 104 in the second innings of the first Test has been the only positive sign for the visitors so far.         
	Ramnaresh Sarwan batted at training on Thursday and is likely to return to the side having missed the Gabba Test due to a back injury. Despite providing some much-needed fight in Brisbane, Travis Dowlin is likely to be the man to miss out.         
	As for Taylors replacement, the selectors were deciding between Darren Sammy and Gavin Tonge, with Sammys batting ability perhaps giving him the edge. At 1-0 down, their chances of regaining the Sir Frank Worrell Trophy are slim but at the very least the team must produce a more competitive effort in the second Test.         
	Australia will miss the Man of the Match from Brisbane, Ben Hilfenhaus, who is injured. As a replacement, the hosts will unleash Doug Bollinger for his second Test.         
	The pitch at the Adelaide Oval promises to pamper the batsmen. The short boundaries square of the wicket give bowlers little room for error and the pitch doesnt tend to play serious tricks.

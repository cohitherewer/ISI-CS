The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods, Stricker lead US charge
                                                     Woods, Stricker lead US charge
          
	San Francisco: A ruthless Tiger Woods and an inspired Steve Stricker tamed Japans Ryo Ishikawa and South Koreas Yang Yong-eun 4 and 2 in fourballs on Saturday as the United States tightened their grip on the Presidents Cup.         
	A long, gruelling day at a chilly and overcast Harding Park ended with the US and Internationals splitting the afternoons five fourball matches but the home team will take a commanding 12- to 9- lead into Sundays singles.         
	The US need only five points from the 12 singles matches on Sunday to clinch victory, leaving Greg Normans men with a daunting uphill climb.         
	We are in a good position being three points up but we need five points to win the Cup, US team veteran Jim Furyk cautioned reporters. They need eight and we need five.         
	Woods and Stricker looked ready to complete a quick afternoons work until the Asians dug in their heels, winning three straight holes from 13th before finally conceding defeat on 16th green.         
	With their victory, Woods and Stricker stretched their record to an unblemished 4-0, marking the first time the world No. 1 has won four matches at a Presidents Cup.         
	It was a pleasure to watch Steve play, said Woods. I was a cheerleader most of the day. Stricks put on a show. It was an exhibition how to putt.         
	Canadian Mike Weir and South African Ernie Els picked up the first point of the afternoon session, crushing Justin Leonard and Zach Johnson 5 amp;3 to trim the U.S. lead to 10-8.         
	The Internationals fight back continued to pick up steam when Australian duo Geoff Ogilvy and Robert Allenby saw off Stewart Cink and Lucas Glover 2 and 1 to further cut into the American advantage.         
	But the tide turned when Furyk and Anthony Kim scored a two-up decision over Argentine Angel Cabrera and Australian Adam Scott before Woods and Strickers victory.         
	Earlier, Woods and Stricker produced a spectacular late comeback to beat Weir and Clark one up when an inspired Woods sank a 22-foot birdie putt on the 17th to square the match that triggered a roar from the crowd.         
	Woods then put his three-iron approach within nine feet of the pin at the par-five 18th to leave Stricker, one of golfs top putters, an eagle chance.           (REUTERS)

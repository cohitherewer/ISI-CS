                                                     Binny downplays comment
  - I dont want to force anything on the CAB, says bengal coach       A STAFF REPORTER            Roger Binny                                 
	Calcutta: Bengal coach Roger Binny on Thursday climbed down from his suggested two-captaincy theory, saying his job here was to offer suggestions and that he left it to the selectors and administrators to decide on the captain and the squad.         
	I am here as a coach and can only offer suggestions. The two-captain theory is just my personal opinion. It is based on what I have seen in the last couple of years It dont want to force anything on the CAB, Binny said after the second days practice session at the Pankaj Gupta Indoor Centre.         
	Binnys comments on Wednesday have stirred a hornets nest. According to a CAB insider, president Jagmohan Dalmiya spoke to the new coach on Thursday morning forcing Binny to tone down his comments.         
	This is obviously going to upset anybody. These things do not help the game but affects team spirit, a visibly upset Dalmiya told reporters.         
	Binnys two-captain theory however, drew varying reactions from cricketers past and present. Some said it was Binnys personal comments while others welcomed it.         
	Former coach and spinner Utpal Chatterjee said: Binnys preference hardly matters to the CAB because they are going to have the last word during the selection. I dont think this will do any good to Bengal cricket.         
	Former captain and current chief selector Sambaran Banerjee declined to comment. Another former captain Gopal Bose said: Life is a matter of options. I know Roger is a good coach He has only suggested a theory but whether it will be implemented or not depends on the CAB. I would suggest to give him some time to settle down.         
	According to a senior Bengal cricketer, who preferred anonymity, the players were surprised with the coachs comment.         
	We were really very surprised with his comments. I dont know what he wanted to say but I feel it was just a suggestion. I would say that if we have brought him as a coach we should listen to his suggestions too I feel we can take a chance.         
	According to a source, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, who led Bengal last season, may be under pressure but is likely to retain his position this time too.         
	Binny, though, said Shukla has nothing more to prove. I know Laxmi from the days when he was with the India A squad And after so many years of cricket he knows where he stands now. I believe he knows how important his presence is with the team, the member of the 1983 World Cup winning side said.         
	Elaborating his view on the changing trend of the game, Binny said that these days even a captain has to earn his place in the team.         
	These days if a captain says that captaincy is affecting his performance then I would say that its an excuse a captain should perform to be in the team. There is no other way, he said.         
	Asked about his opinion about the condition of the Bengal players, Binny said that he found them as positive as described by Bharat Arun.         
	I spoke to Bharat (Arun) before coming here And I find their attitude quite positive But you know mental training is as important as well as their fitness

                                                     Gibbs shines in SA victory
  - World T20 Warm-Ups 
  -   Sri Lanka batsmen come a cropper at Lords                                             
	According to cricinfo, the Proteas made heavy weather of chasing down Sri Lankas disappointing total of 109 for nine at Lords, but they eventually eased home with five balls and six wickets to spare, thanks largely to a third-wicket stand of 70 between Herschelle Gibbs and AB de Villiers.         
	Having been drawn in the toughest group, alongside the West Indies and Australia (whom they face in their opening fixture at Trent Bridge on Monday), Sri Lanka will need to raise their game considerably if they hope to progress in the competition. After batting first they were reduced to 44 for seven at the halfway mark of their innings, as first the pace of Dale Steyn and then the variations of Jacques Kallis and Johan Botha proved too much for their disorientated batsmen.         
	Then in reply, despite being given a flying start by Lasith Malinga and Nuwan Kulasekera, who claimed the big wickets of Graeme Smith and Kallis in the first nine deliveries of South Africas innings, Sri Lanka let the game slip away from them with a spate of dropped catches. Gibbs was missed twice by Ferveez Mahroof in the space of his first ten balls  the first at square leg, the second a regulation spoon over extra cover  and then again on 15, when Tillekeratne Dilshan at short cover couldnt cling onto an inside-out drive.         
	They were mistakes that Sri Lanka could ill afford, given how poorly they had batted earlier in the day, and though both De Villiers and Gibbs fell with the victory in sight  the latter bowled by Malinga for 48 from 53  the remaining 10 runs were easily hunted down by JP Duminy and Mark Boucher.         
	The main man of South Africas performance, however, was Steyn, whose aggression pushed the Sri Lankans onto the defensive from the first over. Though his third delivery of the match was clipped majestically over mid-wicket for six by Dilshan, Steyn responded with a slower ball from his very next delivery, which was lobbed gently to Gibbs at short cover.         
	Sanath Jayasuriya, his form on the wane after a lacklustre IPL, then fell across his stumps to be trapped leg before for one in Steyns second over, and four balls later, Mubarak foolishly took on Gibbs in the covers, and was run out by a pinpoint flick at the non-strikers end.         
	At 16 for three in the third over, Sri Lankas innings was already in a tangle, and though Sangakkara cracked three fours in six balls to apply a touch of momentum, he could do nothing about the seepage of wickets at the other end. Mahela Jayawardene missed with a reverse sweep and had his off-stump flattened by Botha, before Boucher pulled off a screaming one-handed catch in front of first slip to remove Chamara Silva in Kallis second over.         
	Sangakkara was the next to join the procession, as Botha came round the wicket to pin him plumb in front of the stumps for 17, before Indika de Saram plopped a simple catch to Smith at mid-off. At the halfway point of the innings, Sri Lanka were 44 for seven, and the game was already over. Angelo Mathews and Mahroof loitered in a stand of 31 from 35 balls for the eighth wicket to give Sri Lanka something of a total. But for their butterfingers  and had Muttiah Muralidharan also been playing  they might have had a chance of defending the indefensible.         
	Meanwhile, Ramnaresh Sarwans unbeaten 46 lifted the West Indies to 144 for six during a stuttering batting display at Lords. England were sharp in the field and consistent with the ball as they chipped away at the line-up to prevent any real scoring explosion.         
	Chris Gayle, who handed over the captaincy to Denesh Ramdin for this game, didnt bat and Sarwan appeared at No. 6 with the West Indies struggling at 64 for four in the 10th over, but remained until the end to ensure they had something to defend. England fielded their three main quicks, with Stuart Broad the most economical as he went through his variations, and Adil Rashid conceded just five-an-over during his four overs.         
	The West Indies played around with their batting order but didnt help themselves with some of their running. There was a sense of experimentation in the way Paul Collingwood used his bowlers. Rashid was given a bowl ahead of Swann, while Luke Wright was also handed his turn and provided the breakthrough when Marshall gloved his pull to James Foster.         
	Brief scores         
	At Lords: Sri Lanka 109/9 in 20 ovs (Jacques Kallis 2/12, Dale Steyn 2/14). South Africa 113/4 in 19.1 ovs (Herschelle Gibbs 48; Lasith Malinga 2/21). South Africa won by 4 wkts.         
	At Lords: West Indies 144/6 in 20 ovs (Ramnaresh Sarwan 46 ..) vs England.

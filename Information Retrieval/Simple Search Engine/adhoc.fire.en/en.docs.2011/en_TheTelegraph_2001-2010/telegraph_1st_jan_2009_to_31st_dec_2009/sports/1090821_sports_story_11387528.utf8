                                                   Serena sails 
                      
	Toronto: Though World No. 1 Dinara Safina made an early exit from the Rogers Cup on Wednesday, shocked 3-6, 6-2, 6-4 in the second round by 39th ranked Frenchwoman Aravane Rezai as reported in Thursdays late city edition, there were no such slip ups from World No. 2 Serena Williams as she rolled to a 6-3, 6-2 win over Kazakh qualifier Yaroslava Shvedova.         
	The two results set up the possibility of a spicy subplot to the US Open, where the debate over who should be womens No. 1 could be settled on court.         
	With third seed Venus Williams already out, the top half of the draw has opened up for two former best players on the comeback trail, Maria Sharapova and Kim Clijsters.         
	Fifth seed Jelena Jankovic also advanced with a 7-5, 6-4 win over Swiss Patty Schnyder.           (REUTERS)

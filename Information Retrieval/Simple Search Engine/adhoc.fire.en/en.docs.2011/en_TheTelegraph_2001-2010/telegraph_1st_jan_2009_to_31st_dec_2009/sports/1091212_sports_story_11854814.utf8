            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The Indian Football Association (IFA) secretary Utpal Ganguli was involved in a verbal duel with Indias senior national coach Bob Houghton during a discussion Friday.         
	The dialogue, regarding the release of East Bengal players at the senior national camp, wasnt exactly cordial. The IFA top boss was planning to write to AIFF president Praful Patel about the incident.         
	I requested him (Houghton) to release the East Bengal players so that they can take part in the CFL encounter against Chirag United. Not only did he turn down my request  he was very rude, Ganguli said.         
	Ganguli made the request as East Bengal have nine players injured and are finding it difficult to even name a squad of 18 for the match in question.         
	The state body has decided that Saturdays fixture is on although East Bengals executive committee has decided that coach Philipe de Ridder would take a final call on matchday morning.

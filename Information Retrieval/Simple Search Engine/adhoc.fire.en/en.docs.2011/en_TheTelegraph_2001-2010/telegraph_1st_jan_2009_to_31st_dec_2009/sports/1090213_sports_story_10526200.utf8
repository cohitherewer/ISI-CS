                                                   Sachin confirms no T20 Internationals
  - Maestro not convinced about referrals
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar on Thursday confirmed his retirement from Twenty20 Internationals saying that he did not wish to be part of the scheme of things for India in the shortest version of the game.         
	Tendulkar ruled himself out of Indias two Twenty20 Internationals for the upcoming tour of New Zealand, and said that he did not want to disturb the teams winning combination.         
	Sachin has played just one T20 International, against South Africa in 2006, and opted out of the T20 World Championship in South Africa in 2007.         
	Speaking on the sidelines of a promotional event here, Tendulkar said he no longer wanted to be in contention for a place in the team.         
	When I made the decision to miss the T20 Championship in 2007, I was tired after the England tour and wanted rest. I did not feel that I would be able to give my best, so it was a conscious decision not to play then, Tendulkar said.         
	Now the team is doing well and I do not want to disturb the winning combination. I do not want to be part of the (India) T20 team.         
	He, however, said that he would continue to play for the Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League.         
	Tendulkar said he was not convinced with the umpire referral system in which the bating and fielding teams are allowed to ask the umpire to refer a decision to the third umpire.         
	Leg before wicket decisions on referrals are not convincing enough, the 35-year-old Mumbaikar said.         
	Tendulkar was philosophical about the debatable decisions that went against him in the three ODIs he played in Sri Lanka.         
	The whole world has seen. You think about all going well for you but they dont, he said. During a long journey, there are red and green signals along the way.

	Calcutta: A full strength Mohun Bagan went down 0-1 to a mediocre Al Kuwait SC in an AFC Cup encounter at the Howrah Stadium on Tuesday. The home side muffed chances that came their way and then rounded off their unimpressive outing by letting in a soft goal.         
	Lady luck, it seems, has simply deserted Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa. When the AFC Cup was not one of his priorities, a Bagan side sans most of their stars put up a formidable performance against Al Karamah in Syria. But on Tuesday, when the Moroccan had the luxury of fielding his first choice team, except for N.S. Manju who had a hamstring injury, his wards failed to justify their class.         
	In the 13th minute the home side almost succeeded in breaching Al Kuwaits defence. Chasing a stray ball from the midfield, Bhaichung Bhutia threw off the challenge from defender Fahad Homoud and, with goalkeeper Musab Alkandri out of place, all the Bagan captain needed to do was place the ball in the net. But Bhaichungs shot sailed over the horizontal.         
	However, visiting coach Laurand Banide pipped his Moroccan counterpart with smart tactical planning. Aware of the limitations of his young side, Banide started with Farag Laheeb as the lone striker. He used as many as six men in the midfield and that stifled the four-man Bagan midfield. Karims boys did all the running around but most of their moves were nipped in the bud by the energetic youngsters from Kuwait.         
	On the other hand, Karim persisted with a sick Barreto, when he should have brought on a fresh pair of legs. A three-striker strategy wouldnt have been a bad idea either because the Kuwaitis never posed any serious threat to their defence.         
	 An Ishfaq Ahmed side volley off a Peter Odafe throw-in came tantalisingly close in the dying stages off the first half.         
	But it was Al Kuwait who managed to score in the 60th minute when Samer Almartah fooled a host of Bagan defenders, including keeper Sangram Mukherjee, with an opportunistic back heel from a melee inside the Bagan box. Ishfaqs feeble attempt with a clear view of the goal in the 76th minute was the only other instance of Bagan coming close to scoring.         
	Tempers flew on a hot day as the players were involved in a scuffle. Barreto, usually a cool customer on the field, was lucky to escape punishment after he pushed a rival player during the altercation. With Tuesdays victory Al Kuwait SC go top of group D.

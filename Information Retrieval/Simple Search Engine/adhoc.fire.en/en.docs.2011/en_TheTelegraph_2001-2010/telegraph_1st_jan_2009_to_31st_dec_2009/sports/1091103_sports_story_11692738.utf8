                                                                                                                                   Its a win-win situation with offshore matches: Ijaz Butt
    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  PCB chairman says Pak players have the nod for IPL 2010             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              Rudra Pratap Singh and teammates celebrate Pakistan captain Younis Khans wicket during  the recent Champions Trophy in South Africa. For now, the two countries will only be   playing in ICC-conducted events      
	Chandigarh: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman, Ijaz Butt, spoke to The Telegraph on Monday morning.         
	The interview was conducted at the classy bungalow of an old friend of his, industrialist Jagdip Singh.         
	Butt, incidentally, played eight Tests between 1959-1962. The one-time keeper-batsman is 71 now.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q Youre one cricket board chief who is always in the news...         
	A (Grins) I hope its for good reasons!         
	Later in the day, youre expected to have informal talks with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, Shashank Manohar. Are you, so to say, confident of a breakthrough?         
	What Id like to emphasise is that the BCCI has been helpful towards us and weve been getting their support on most of our issues...         
	But what about the bitterness caused in matters relating to the 2011 World Cup, including the shifting of the secretariat from Lahore to Mumbai?         
	Well, one has to be realistic and the reality is that teams just arent willing to play in Pakistan... After saying yes, Zimbabwe declined to send even its U-19 team, because some of the parents had strong reservations... Its something that has to be accepted.         
	The BCCI isnt keen, but youre very interested in playing India at an offshore venue.         
	Thats correct, but Id rather not say anything much till something gets finalised...Weve got the option of playing in Dubai/Abu Dhabi and also the UK... One could look at other venues, in Asia and beyond, as well... Malaysia, South Africa... As I told you last evening, Im hopeful... Dekhen kya hota hai... I wouldnt like to comment prematurely.         
	As regards the IPL, would your government and the PCB itself okay the Pakistani players participation in the third edition, next year?         
	Of course... There would be no restrictions either from the government or from the PCB. Weve conveyed that to the IPLs governing body.         
	With so much of offshore cricket involving Pakistan, dont you think even an improvement in the security environment may not impress others and they could still insist on offshore venues only?         
	Thats not the fear... Our cricketers have to play at the international level, even if, for now, it can only be in Dubai/Abu Dhabi and the UK as the host team... In the circumstances, its a win-win situation with the offshore matches.         
	How soon do you expect international cricket to resume in Pakistan?         
	If I could put a date, I wouldve said yesterday! Frankly, its difficult to say anything with certainty... The International Cricket Council will, first, have to give its security clearance... We, in Pakistan, have to go with how the rest of the world views the situation in our country.         
	Why is the PCB dragged into controversies? Also, arent some influential people in Karachi trying to destabilise it?         
	I can handle those elements... My conscience is clear... I know Im doing my best to promote cricket in Pakistan... What upsets me is when sections of the media distort facts and give a totally incorrect picture... That, indeed, is worrying.         
	Youve always been supporting Younis Khan to the hilt...         
	Younis is an asset and hes a fine captain... The boys respond to him very well... Hell remain the Test and ODI captain as long as hes in form and stays fit.         
	Shahid Afridi is the T20 captain. Whats going to happen if Younis takes back his T20-specific retirement?         
	(Laughs) Well cross that bridge once we get there.         
	Whenever your team loses, the National Assemblys standing committee on sports gets into the act, summoning the captain and coach for rather unnecessary grilling. Whats your take?         
	Its not correct to say that the National Assembly doesnt applaud the Pakistan teams successes. The members gave a standing ovation, which was unprecedented, when Younis and the boys won the World T20... Ive written to the appropriate authority that, in future, no player or coach be summoned... Instead, Ill be happy to answer questions and give clarifications... The committee has the right to ask questions and demand clarifications. The National Assembly, remember, is the supreme body as its members represent the public.         
	So, in future, no captain and coach will be summoned?         
	Lets see, Ive already requested... Calling them causes unnecessary tension. (After a pause) The No.1 item on the committees agenda, after the Champions Trophy, was the last-ball loss to Australia... Tell me, how can somebody fix a match in such a manner? If somebody could do it, then hes a genius beyond anybodys imagination... Its so unfortunate that this match-fixing thing comes up after every defeat. Winning and losing is part of the game, its just that the effort shouldnt be lacking.         
	Whats the biggest challenge for the PCB?  
	In a general context, ensuring that teams get to play in Pakistan and, specifically, ensuring a quick resumption of bilateral exchanges with India.         
	The final one: Whats the biggest change from the time you played and now?         
	In my time, playing for the country was seen as an honour... Today, its all about money and more money... Thats the way it is, now, but I wouldnt say Im disappointed.

                                                   CAB fines EB, Mohun Bagan
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The CAB on Tuesday fined East Bengal and Mohun Bagan for the involvement of some club officials in scuffles at Eden Gardens during their first division match in the first week of January. Both clubs were also cautioned against such behaviour in future.         
	The CAB summoned officials from the two clubs on Tuesday evening and informed them of its decision. Officials had clashed following an on-field altercation between the players.         
	While the clubs were fined Rs 10,000 each for the rumpus, the two players, Bagan captain Manoj Tiwary and East Bengals Ritam Porel, have also been directed to pay Rs 3,000 and Rs 1,000, respectively. This after both players submitted letters offering their unconditional apology to the CAB.         
	Upon being dismissed, Porel, who was perhaps taking a bit too long in walking back to the pavilion, got into a verbal duel with Tiwary. This incensed the officials from the rival clubs and the Eden soon turned into a virtual battlefield. It was only after the intervention of some CAB officials that the situation was brought under control.         
	President Jagmohan Dalmiya said that the money received as penalty would go to the Players Benevolent Fund.         
	The CAB also received a letter from Ranji coach Utpal Chatterjee who had been critical of team selection during the Ranji Trophy.         
	In a letter addressed to the CAB joint secretary, Chatterjee said he regretted his comments and added that he would take express care to see that such a gaffe wasnt repeated. Dalmiya signalled the matter closed by saying that the CAB had accepted Chatterjees apology.

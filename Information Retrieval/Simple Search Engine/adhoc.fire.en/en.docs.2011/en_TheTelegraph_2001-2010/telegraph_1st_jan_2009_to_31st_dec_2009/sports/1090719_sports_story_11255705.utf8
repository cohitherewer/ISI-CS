The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | All eyes on Vaas ahead of 3rd Test
                                                   All eyes on Vaas ahead of 3rd Test
                      
	Colombo: Rampant Sri Lanka go into the final Test against Pakistan here from Monday, aiming for a 3-0 sweep despite the uncertain future of veteran seamer Chaminda Vaas.         
	Vaas, 35, was named in a 16-man squad for the third Test at the Sinhalese Sports Club after being overlooked for the first two matches which Sri Lanka won to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series.         
	A local newspaper reported on Saturday that the Sri Lankan selectors and administrators picked the left-arm seamer to give him the opportunity to use the match as his farewell Test. However, Sri Lankas chief selector Asantha de Mel rubbished the speculations. (AFP)

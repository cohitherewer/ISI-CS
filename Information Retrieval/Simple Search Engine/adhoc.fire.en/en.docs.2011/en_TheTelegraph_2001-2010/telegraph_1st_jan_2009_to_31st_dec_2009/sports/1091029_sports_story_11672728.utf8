                                                   Dhoni batters Aussies
    - India level series as Ravindra Jadeja takes three for 35             INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                            
	Nagpur: There was no stopping Mahendra Singh Dhoni at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium at Jamtha, in the outskirts of the city, Wednesday evening.         
	First, he almost single-handedly pinned down the Australians with a superbly crafted 124 off 107 balls which propelled the hosts to 354 for seven in the second one-day International. And then he showed his leadership qualities, ringing in the bowling changes effectively as the visitors huffed and puffed against the mammoth target.         
	Not just rediscovering Dhonis batting prowess, the 99-run victory also threw up a lot of positives for the home side. Yuvraj Singhs all-round qualities that India dearly missed in the Champions Trophy, Ishant Sharma and Praveen Kumars disciplined and fiery opening spells, Ravindra Jadejas wicket-taking abilities (3/35), the teams athletic fielding  everything fell into place for India on this day.         
	Coming as it did after 16 months (his last century was against Hong Kong in Karachi in the Asia Cup), the Team India captains fifth one-day hundred took the wind out of the Australian sails after they had threatened to make a comeback in the middle overs.         
	Dhoni was at his destructive best toying with an Australian attack sans Brett Lee and a half-fit Mitchell Johnson. The rest of the bowlers were left clueless in the face of the onslaught.         
	Dhoni was slow to begin with as he partnered Gautam Gambhir in a 119-run fourth wicket stand. The openers unfortunate run out at the end of the 34th over found Dhoni going hammer and tongs at the bowling. With Suresh Raina for company, he put on 136 runs for the fifth wicket that decimated the visitors challenge.         
	The calls for Dhoni promoting himself up the order have grown in the past few days, and on Wednesday, it was proved how effective his batting can be if he gets to play a few extra overs. Coming in at the 16th over, he held the innings together, and finally provided the momentum needed to square the Hero Honda Cup at 1-1.         
	He timed his innings to perfection, as his body seemed to be alive with the challenge of the moment, enjoying the surge that pressure brings. Runs came in a hurry with boundaries taken off his pads and cuts dispatched through point. It was exhilarating stuff, as the sell-out crowd enjoyed every moment of it.         
	The batting Powerplay was taken after the 39th over. Forty seven runs came off the next five, and Ricky Pontings decision not to risk his bowlers in the late evening dew, had backfired.         
	It was a one man show despite Gambhirs 76 off 80 balls and Rainas 62 off 50 balls. When Nathan Hauritzs direct throw found Gambhir short of his crease, no one could have imagined how destructive the final few overs would turn out to be.         
	In recording Indias highest total against the Aussies, Dhoni showed the self-belief and willingness to control adversity. Having completed his century in great style  a six off Shane Watson  he repeated the act off the next ball. In all, the innings was laced with nine fours and three sixes.         
	Rarely has one seen the world champions take the field reeling under the impact of an offensive by the opposition. Add to that the fall of three quick wickets, including Ponting, and it was all over by the end of the 11th over. The visiting captain was plumb in front as Praveen nipped one back.         
	Michael Husseys best efforts (53 off 60 balls) only delayed the inevitable.         
	No contest against the Australians would be complete without the mind games in the middle. Dhoni and Johnson got into one Wednesday  an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation after the pacer had barged into Dhonis path who was trying to beat a Ponting throw at the non-strikers end.         
	Later, as Shane Watson fended off Ishants first delivery that reared up at his face and Sachin Tendulkar completed the catch at slip, angry words were exchanged.         
	The start, though, wasnt that bleak for Australia. Pontings decision to field seemed to have been vindicated by his opening bowlers as Ben Hilfenhaus, replacing Lee, and Peter Siddle worked up good pace on a surface that offered appreciable bounce.         
	Gambhir and Dhoni were hit on the helmet, but that was not enough to stem the flow of runs as the Indian batsmen went about their task in calculated fashion.         
	The first three overs produced 30 runs before Sachin departed in almost a similar fashion to his Vadodara dismissal. Sachin played away from his body to a wide and full-pitched delivery from Siddle and the outside edge carried to the slip cordon.         
	A great start for the Victorian pacer. A former wood-chopping champion from West Gippsland in Victoria, Siddle had to give up his first love because of the high risk of cutting off his own toes. But he remains the axeman in an injury-hit Australian attack.         
	Virender Sehwag was his own spectacular self during his 31-ball 40, slashing, driving and clipping over the top for boundaries on both sides of the wicket.         
	Yuvrajs 24-ball cameo then yielded 23 runs. At 97 for three, it looked that the Australians had tightened the noose but Dhoni, who found able companions in Gambhir and Raina, was in no mood to give up.         
	The blitzkrieg that followed left the visitors stunned.

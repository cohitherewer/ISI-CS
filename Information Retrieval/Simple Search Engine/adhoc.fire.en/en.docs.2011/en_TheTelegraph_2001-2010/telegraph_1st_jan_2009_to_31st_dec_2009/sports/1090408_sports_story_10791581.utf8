The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Blame game on at SAI 
                                                   Blame game on at SAI 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Archery Association of India (AAI) has blamed the Sports Authority of India (SAI), Salt Lake, for not conforming to the sports ministrys directions by refusing accommodation to two Korean coaches, Chae Hong Gi (Army Sports Institute, Pune) and Lee wong Wee (Mittal Champions Trust). SAI director S. Harmil Api, on the other hand, has blamed the AAI of trying to defame him.         
	Both are here to oversee the selection trials, beginning on Thursday, for the World Cup Stage II (Porec) and III (Antalya) and second Asian GP in Tehran.         
	But SAI director Api had a different story to tell. According to him, the AAI, and particularly Mukherjee, are trying to defame him with false accusations. They are simply trying to get an upper hand on the SAI. I wont allow that, Api said.         
	I have never denied accommodation to anyone. I am ready to provide them with accommodation. But they demanded that I would have to accommodate their families also. With shortage of space I cant allow that, explained Api.         
	For now, the two coaches have been put up at nearby hotels.

	Bulawayo: Zimbabwe captain Prosper Utseya acknowledged that his team is under pressure from home fans going into the five one-day matches against Bangladesh.         
	Its obviously important for us to win and move up the ranks, Utseya said.         
	Its an important series for us, which we need to win to give the Zimbabwean people something to smile about.         
	The Zimbabwe team has been boosted by the return of batsman Mark Vermeulen and Charles Coventry. (AP)

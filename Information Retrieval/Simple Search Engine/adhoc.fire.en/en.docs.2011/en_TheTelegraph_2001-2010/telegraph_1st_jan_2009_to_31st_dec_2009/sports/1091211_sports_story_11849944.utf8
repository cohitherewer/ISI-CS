	Calcutta: Aboline, the Bangalore (summer) Derby winner, makes the line-up in Saturdays classic, the 1,600m Calcutta 2000 Guineas. The race also bears the sponsors pre-fix, the Casino Royale Goa, the company which had patronised the 1,000 Guineas, a fortnight ago. Credit Squeeze, the Colts Stakes winner, who lost the Monsoon Derby to Gloriosa, spearheads the local challenge in the six-horse line-up. The field also includes South India challenger, Fair Option, who was a fair second to Sparks in the 2,000m Golconda Derby but failed in his lead-up race here, indicating he needed the run. The three horses have been working extremely well of late. The first race starts at 12.15pm.ACCEPTANCES

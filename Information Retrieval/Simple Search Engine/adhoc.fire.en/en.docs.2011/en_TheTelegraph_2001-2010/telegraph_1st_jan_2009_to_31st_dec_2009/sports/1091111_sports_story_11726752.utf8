The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Portugal to have their say on Ronaldo 
                                                                                                                                   Portugal to have their say on Ronaldo 
                      
	Lisbon: Cristiano Ronaldo was due to join Portugals squad on Tuesday for medical tests ahead of the World Cup playoff despite Real Madrids insistence that his ankle is still injured.         
	Portugal coach Carlos Queiroz, however, chose to allay the clubs fears saying the decision whether Ronaldo should play against Bosnia-Herzegovina would be taken carefully.         
	We are convinced the decision will be made in accord with the players interests and, with that, the interests of all the parties will be safeguarded, he said.         
	The steps are simple  there is a call up, an evaluation, a decision, and then life goes on.         
	Queiroz, a former Real Madrid coach himself, also denied there had been a row with Real over the players availability.         
	I want to put a full stop to this soap opera that has been created without any basis.         
	The parties are fulfilling their obligations and thats whats important, Queiroz said.         
	Real, which paid a world-record euro94 million ($141 million) to Manchester United for the winger in the off-season, had initially balked at allowing Ronaldo to travel as he hasnt played in a month.         
	But the Spanish club said on its website in a one-sentence statement that Ronaldo will make the trip.         
	Fifa rules say clubs must permit national football federations to carry out their own fitness tests.         
	Queiroz said he didnt know if Ronaldo would play against Bosnia-Herzegovina on Saturday in Lisbon or at Zenica on November 18.         
	Cristiano, like all players, will undergo medical tests ... and the team doctors will make an appropriate decision, Queiroz said.         
	Ronaldo was hurt during Reals Champions League match with Marseille on September 30.         
	He then aggravated the injury while playing for Portugal in a World Cup qualifier against Hungary on October 10 and hasnt played since.         
	The Portuguese Football Federation said all other players from Spanish clubs must travel to Portugal on Wednesday, after Tuesdays Copa del Rey matches.           (AP)

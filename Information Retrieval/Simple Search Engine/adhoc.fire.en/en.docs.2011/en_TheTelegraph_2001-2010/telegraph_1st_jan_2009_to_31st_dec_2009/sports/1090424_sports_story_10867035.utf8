                                                   Criticism keeps Barreto going
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan striker Jose Ramirez Barreto feels Bagan are a more mature side after a season under the tutelage of Karim Bencharifa. According to him, Bagan in the next season will come back much stronger.         
	The Brazilian veteran looked back on last season and answered a few questions put forth by The Telegraph recently.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q How do you feel about Bagan missing out on the I-League title by a whisker? What do you think were the reasons?         
	A We had some negative results at the beginning of the I-League. We lost two matches against (Mumbai FC and Sporting Clube de Goa) and drew three matches resulting in a big gap of 12 points between the leaders and us. That put us under immense pressure till the last match. I think we lacked proper homework.         
	How would you rate Bagans performance this season?         
	We had a pretty good season overall. Coming into the I-League straight after winning the Calcutta Football League with East Bengal and United SC giving us a good fight was very important. Although we had a poor start, I feel finishing second is not at all a bad performance. We won two major titles  the Calcutta league and the Federation Cup  both were very important. Both victories came at the right time, encouraging us to move forward. It has given us the confidence to move on.         
	Who do you think should be credited for Bagans success? Coach Karim Bencharifa or Bhaichung Bhutia and Barreto?         
	Look you cannot credit one for this. The environment at Bagan this season was very positive. It was, simply said, perfect for good football. And all credit goes to the officials who supported us in everything. Credit also goes to the coach. The mood in the dressing room was great. We kept the spirit going throughout the season and that helped us mature as a team and deliver when needed.         
	Are you happy the way you and Bhaichung played?         
	Estimation is always difficult But I feel we both have played very well. We played crucial roles and scored in important matches. I think it was a good season for both of us.         
	You finished among the top four scorers in the I-League. At 32, what is the secret of this?         
	The secret  I feel criticism keeps me going. Criticism has been my motivation for a long time. Look, when you are growing old you need to work hard to remain fit and agile. At that time you need to think before time and remain focused. That is what I have been doing. I know expectations are still the same I have always been very disciplined with my life and that has helped me keep my mental balance Helped me go on.         
	How long do you think you would be able to continue playing?         
	I really cannot say. I have never thought of that But it may be time in another two years. It depends on my physical condition. Its very difficult to say when it will be over. But you know it will be very difficult for me to hang up my boots.         
	Which I-League side has impressed you the most?         
	Sporting Clube de Goa were a surprise. Its unfortunate they could not win the I-League but they played some good football.         
	Who among the I-League players do you think is promising?         
	I think Joaquim Abranches is the best among the newcomers. He is tall, well-built and skilful. He can move fast and is a dangerous player Moreover he plays according to the situation. I feel he is the next star of Indian football.

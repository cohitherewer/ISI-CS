The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Attack in-form batsman early
                                                                                                                   Attack in-form batsman early
Make sure you are balanced with a steady head at the time of delivery            CRICKET ONLINE    Ravi Shastri                        
	What strategy should a captain adopt to dismiss an in-form batsman?              
	(Ankit Pattnaik, 17, Rourkela)              
	Dont sit back and wait for him to make a mistake. Attack him early with the view to getting him out and playing on his ego. If he gets in then you can at least say you gave it a shot rather than being defensive from the outset.              
	How does one tackle the swinging deliveries during the slog overs?              
	(Pratik Srivastava, 18, Hooghly)              
	Watch the ball and anticipate which way the ball will move. Very few bowlers have the ability to move it both ways a la Akram or Zaheer in the slog overs.              
	What is the right way to play a flighted delivery?              
	(Abhijit Sarkar, 17, Tezpur)              
	Use your feet to get close to the pitch of the ball.              
	I am a right-arm medium pacer and 5ft 4 inches tall. How do I measure my run-up?              
	(Subham Krishna Borah, 12, Guwahati)              
	This is something you can easily work on with your coach.              
	I am a medium pacer. I have been experiencing problems with my run-up resulting in a lot of no balls. Please help.              
	(Biswajit Datta, 19, Calcutta-22)              
	Again try and start running in from a step back.              
	I am a right-handed batsman and very uncomfortable against full-pitched deliveries. I get bowled when trying to make room. Please help.              
	(Priyanuj Mazumdar, 13, Guwahati)              
	Watch the ball and your back-lift and only make room if you have eyed a gap in the field and you want to push the scoring rate along.              
	I am a right-arm medium pacer and often change my action to suit my needs. Can it pose problems for my bowling?              
	(Soham Kumar, 16, Calcutta)              
	Nothing wrong in it as long as you are confident and stick to the basics.              
	I fail to control the new ball when trying to bowl fast. Please help.              
	(Satyajit Chakraborty, 21, Siliguri)              
	Make sure you are balanced with a steady head at the time of delivery.              
	Does scoring lots of runs on flat wickets help?              
	(Tapan Gupta, 22, Dibrugarh)              
	Helps in getting into a habit of playing a long innings and boosting your confidence.              
	I am a right-handed batsman and take a middle stump guard. Is shuffling a bit necessary to tackle fast bowlers?              
	(Srijit Ghosh, 19, Calcutta-10)              
	Not too much with that guard. Thats one of the reasons you have taken that guard.

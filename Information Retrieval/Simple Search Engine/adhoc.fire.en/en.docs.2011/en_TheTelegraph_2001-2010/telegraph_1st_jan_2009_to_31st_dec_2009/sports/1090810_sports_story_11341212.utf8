The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Match-fixing row crops up in ICL
                                                   Match-fixing row crops up in ICL
                      
	Karachi: A new match-fixing controversy has surfaced with the release of an audio tape in which two Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) officials are allegedly talking about games being fixed in the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL).         
	The audio tape was sent to several media representatives from an unknown email address and was also uploaded on a website. The tape has a member of the national selection committee Mohammed Illyas telling PCB chief operating officer Saleem Altaf about how matches were fixed in the ICL.         
	He is apparently referring to the first edition of the ICL, a league in which his soninlaw Imran Farhat also took part.         
	Illyas, a former Test player, tells how several Pakistani players fixed matches and also how a discarded Test batsman used to go out to bat drunk.         
	Incidentally, the audio tape has nothing much coming from Altaf who is heard saying mostly yes, yes, okay, okay. (PTI)

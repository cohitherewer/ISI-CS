The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhutia calls for change
                                                   Bhutia calls for change
    - India captain generates heat off the field       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: A day after guiding India to an impressive win over Sri Lanka in the Nehru Cup, Bhaichung Bhutia stressed on the importance of good infrastructure for the development of the game in the country.         
	Football infrastructure in India hasnt improved much in all these years, said the India captain on Thursday. It was no different when I started playing football 17 years ago. Perhaps it has become worse. The authorities should do something to improve the conditions, he said.         
	Clubs like Mohun Bagan, East Bengal and Dempo are struggling to find training grounds and the time has come to launch initiatives to get their own grounds, the icon said. Thankfully, the national federation has now adopted a better marketing technique, he added.         
	Bhaichung devoted all of Thursday afternoon to the promotion of the game. First, he was the star attraction at the launch of a sports bar with a Manchester United theme at a five star hotel and, an hour later, he clicked on the mouse to launch the website of the Football Players Association of India (FPAI), of which he is the founder-president.         
	At both events, Bhaichung spoke at length on Indian football, its problems and his view on the game. Football in India, he said needed administrative support for marketing and infrastructure.         
	Extremely keen to promote the FPAI, Bhaichung said the association would work hard for the footballers in India.         
	Not every footballer can become a Cristiano Ronaldo in his career. But in the end, he can opt to become a referee or a coach. Our job would be to help them to make a career out of the game after their playing careers are over, said Bhaichung.         
	The ace striker said that during the tour of Portugal he saw how relatively unknown players were being helped by others from the fraternity. Better known footballers will organise matches for them so that spotters can come and have a look at them. FPAI has been formed for the welfare of the players, not to fight with anyone.         
	Player contracts, Bhaichung said, was another grey area that needed looking into. There should be an uniform and model contract for all professional footballers and we have been telling the AIFF to implement it for quite some time.         
	Three other members of the Indian team  Mahesh Gawli, Sunil Chetri and Gourmangi Singh  who were also present during the launch of the FPAI website, supported Bhaichungs views.         
	I, too, faced contract problems during the early days of my career, said Gawli. Such practices should be stopped.         
	Chetri said that at times the players are victims of malpractice by the clubs. The clubs force them to sign on contracts which they do not even understand. Football cannot be run so unprofessionally, Chetri said.         
	Asked whether coaches without a degree should continue to ply their trade in India, Bhaichung said it was for the AIFF to take a decision on the issue.

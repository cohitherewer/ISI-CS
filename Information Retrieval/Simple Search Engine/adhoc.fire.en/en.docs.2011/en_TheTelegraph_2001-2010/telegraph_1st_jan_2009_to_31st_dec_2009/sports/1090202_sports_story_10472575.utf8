	Calcutta: Nobody was surprised when Mahindra United beat United SC 2-0 in the I-League at the Salt Lake stadium Sunday. The difference between the two sides on paper is huge, but Uniteds 3-1 victory in their earlier encounter had raised hopes of an even match. United made no mistakes in proving their win in the away match was nothing more than a fluke.         
	Mahindra, who boast of India regulars like N.P. Pradeep and Steven Dias, along with the dreaded Edeh Chidi, were the better team right from the word go. However, they could not score till the 51st minute. Chidi and Arata Izumi launched some attacks but could not finish.         
	The best chance fell to Chidi in the 18th minute when Douhou Sey D. Pierre grabbed the ball on the edge of the United box with his back to the goal and sent the ball beautifully to the left of the box. Unmarked Chidi ran in but he had to hurry because the United keeper Somnath Khara was also rushing out. The Nigerian striker ended up shooting the ball well wide.         
	The visitors found the goal early in the second half after Louis Nigi Ebami tripped Arata on the edge of the United box. The referee awarded Mahindra a freekick. Man of the Match Dias took a superb freekick which flew over the wall, dipping as it beat the United goalie.         
	Dias, who said he has offers from Danish and Swedish clubs, had a fine match. So far he only had bad memories of the city as he had not been allowed to play for East Bengal this season. This match gave him something good to remember.         
	Chidis goal in the 71st minute made the scoreline a perfect representation of the proceedings. He made a solo run into the United box from the left and shot. The right footer was fisted away by Khara, but fell to Arata. His shot was again saved by Khara but Chidi followed the ball and shot it in to make it 2-0. The win took Mahindra to 15 points while United remain on 13.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AITA sees no problems in hosting Australia
                                                   AITA sees no problems in hosting Australia
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The All-India Tennis Association on Saturday sought to dismiss speculation that the Australian mens team wanted the upcoming Davis Cup zonal tie in May shifted to a neutral venue due to security reasons.         
	We are looking forward to the Davis Cup tie to be played in Chennai and we are confident of beating Australia, AITA executive president Anil Khanna told The Telegraph over phone.         
	India are to host Australia in an Asia-Oceania group one third round tie from May 8-10, but reports in a section of the Australian media have said that Tennis Australia would decide on travelling to the subcontinent after holding discussions with the International Tennis Federation (ITF).         
	I think everyones probably got concerns, probably more so last week after what happened in Pakistan, Australias former Wimbledon champion Lleyton Hewitt has been quoted as saying.         
	Hewitt, however, was a long way away from deciding to withdraw from the tie. Thered have to be a lot more research into it. Right at the moment, before we got through last weekend, I hadnt even looked (at the India tie), he said.

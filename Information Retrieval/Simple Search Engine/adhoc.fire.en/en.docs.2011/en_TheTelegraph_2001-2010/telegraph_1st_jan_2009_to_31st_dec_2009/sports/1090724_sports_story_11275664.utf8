                                                   AIS beat Indians
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Their batting let the Indians down as they suffered a seven-wicket defeat at the hands of the Australian Institute of Sports (AIS) in their 50-over match in the Emerging Players Tournament here Thursday.         
	Put in to bat, Indians were all out for 139 and the AIS rode on an unbeaten half-century from Tom Cooper to overhaul the target at the Peter Burge Oval.         
	Taking two wickets and a wicket, respectively, were Nizar Niyas and Rahul Shukla, two Indians from the MRF Pace Foundation appearing in the tournament for the AIS, coached by Greg Chappell, the former India coach.         
	For India, Virat Kohli top-scored with 35 while Naman Ojha, Murali Vijay, Manoj Tiwary and Ajinkya Rahane were the other contributors.

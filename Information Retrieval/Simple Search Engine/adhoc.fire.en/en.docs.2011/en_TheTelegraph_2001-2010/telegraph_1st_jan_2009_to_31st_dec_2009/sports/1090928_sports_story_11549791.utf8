The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Furious Heidfeld blasts Sutil
                                                     Furious Heidfeld blasts Sutil
                  Adrian Sutil                     
	Singapore: Germanys Nick Heidfeld accused Force Indias Adrian Sutil of brainless behaviour on Sunday after a Singapore Grand Prix collision ended the BMW-Sauber drivers record run of Formula One finishes.         
	The incident on lap 21 meant the experienced BMW-Sauber driver had failed to be classified in a race for the first time in 42 starts dating back to the 2007 US Grand Prix.         
	I think it was extremely stupid of Sutil, Heidfeld said after leaving the track.         
	I was ahead of him... my front... He should look where he goes, he fumed.         
	Asked what his team would do next, the driver responded: Maybe we try to find a brain for him.         
	Sutil was later fined $20,000 and reprimanded by race stewards.         
	He had been initially unrepentant after spinning on turn 14 and driving into his compatriot, but later apologised.         
	It was quite frustrating at the start as we knew with the one stop we were very heavy, but Jaime (Alguersuari) was very slow and really fighting with the car.         
	He was holding me up a lot and I tried a few times to pass him but I finally saw a chance. I tried and it wasnt enough  I was a little late on the brakes, spun and thats it.         
	Then Nick came around the corner and hit my front wing as I was stuck in the corner.         
	I didnt see him coming as I was on the move already and couldnt react to it, but Im sorry for it.         
	It was a race incident.         
	The collision ended a miserable Grand Prix for Heidfeld.         
	He started the race last and from the pitlane after his team discovered they had made a mistake with the weight of his car in qualifying.         
	Heidfeld had initially qualified seventh on Saturday night.         
	Although my chances were far from promising today, it is still annoying not to finish because of such a stupid incident, Heidfeld said.         
	He had spun backwards and then just drove back on to the track and straight into my car.         
	Thats something you just cant do.                   (REUTERS)

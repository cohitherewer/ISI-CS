            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A fresh controversy is threatening to trouble the Bengal camp.         
	The issue is the last-minute inclusion of Arindam Ghosh, in place of an injured Abhishek Jhunjhunwala, as the 15th member of the squad.         
	It has been learnt that Arindam was summoned by the selectors Tuesday morning, after Abhishek, who was carrying a hip injury for the past week, failed to clear the fitness test.         
	However, the convenor of the selection committee, which happens to be CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey, was kept in the dark about Arindams inclusion.         
	I should have been informed about Arindams inclusion, but I had no inkling that he has been summoned as the 15th member this morning, Dey said.         
	If the selectors want performance to be the only criteria for being selected, then how come a player, who has scored just 91 in six first-class innings, is recalled when someone like Arnab Nandi (whose name was discussed at the selection committee meeting) does not get a chance to be with the senior team? a senior office-bearer asked.

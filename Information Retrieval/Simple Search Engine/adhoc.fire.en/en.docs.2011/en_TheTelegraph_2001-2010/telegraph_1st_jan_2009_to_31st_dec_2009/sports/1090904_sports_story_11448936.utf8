                                                   Hogging the limelight
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Catch Them Young is the watchword of the Tata Football Academy (TFA). And why that is a winning strategy was underlined by the academy youngsters Thursday.         
	Robin Singh, Jagtar Singh and Irfan Khan, the TFA goalscorers admitted it was the most memorable achievement in their young career.         
	We were a little unstable in the beginning But then, we were confident that we might pull off an upset, said Robin, who scored the third goal.         
	Anyone in Indian soccer that he looks up to? No, I dont idolise anyone on the Indian circuit. I want to aim big I myself want to be the idol, was the 19-year-olds prompt reply.         
	Jagtar Singh, a 19-year-old, left I-League side JCTs academy to join TFA.         
	I wasnt really comfortable at the JCT academy in Punjab as I was pitted against much older boys. Then Rakesh Masih (India and Mohun Bagan) advised me to switch to TFA and I have hugely benefited from that, he said.

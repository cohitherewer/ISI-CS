The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I was too confident in Berlin: Yelena
                                                     I was too confident in Berlin: Yelena
                  Yelena Isinbayeva                     
	Zurich: Yelena Isinbayeva is learning humility from her crushing defeat at the World Championships.         
	The Russian pole vaulter failed to clear a height 10 days ago in Berlin and surrendered her world title to Anna Rogowska of Poland.         
	She blamed the shock defeat to complacency. It will stay on my mind until I retire, Isinbayeva said Thursday, on the eve of the Weltklasse meet. This defeat changed my mind a lot. Now I value much more sport and competition.         
	It can happen to others as well, when you have no rivals, where there is 20 cms between you and second place, when you have easy victories, the 27-year-old Olympic champion added.         
	I was a bit overconfident maybe. It was a like a normal day of work.         
	Isinbayeva holds the world record at 5.05m and has broken the outdoor and indoor marks a total of 26 times. She has won the last two Olympic titles and has dominated the event like no other woman before her.         
	It was going to be easy victory, world record, I was too relaxed, the Russian said of the worlds. Then everything went wrong. I think the main thing was that I was too confident.         
	In Berlin, Isinbayeva picked her first height too late and did not start jumping until 4.75. Rogowska has now beaten Isinbayeva in their last two meets.         
	I value victories much more now, Isinbayeva said. Before, victories meant almost nothing to me.         
	Isinbayeva said the defeat also had a positive side. Its like some stone fell down from me, like starting form zero, she said.         
	Isinbayeva went to her home in Monaco after the World Championships to train and reflect on her Berlin defeat.         
	I did nothing special,: she said. Now I am looking forward to the competition, although I am still tired.         
	In Fridays competition, Isinbayeva will face Rogowska and the two women who shared the silver in Berlin, Chelsea Johnson of the US and Monika Pyrek of Poland.         
	The Weltklasse meet at the Letzigrund stadium is the fifth of six Golden League events, with four athletes still in the running for the $1 million jackpot in addition to Isinbayeva  Kenenisa Bekele of Ethiopia, the 5,000 and 10,000 world champion in Berlin, 100m sprinter Kerron Stewart of Jamaica and Sanya Richards of the US in the 400. The jackpot goes to athletes who win their event at all six meets.           (AP)

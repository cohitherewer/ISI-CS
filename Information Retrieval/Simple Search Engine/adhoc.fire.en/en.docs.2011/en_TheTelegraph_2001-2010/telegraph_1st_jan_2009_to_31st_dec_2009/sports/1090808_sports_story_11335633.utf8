The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Great first day for Australia
                                                   Great first day for Australia
                      
	Leeds: Australia took control of the fourth Ashes Test with devastating swing bowling and positive batting on a dramatic first day on Friday.         
	Seamers Peter Siddle and Stuart Clark sliced through the England batting order to dismiss the hosts for 102, their lowest total in an Ashes Test at Headingley for 100 years.         
	Shane Watson and Ricky Ponting shared a quickfire second-wicket partnership of 119 and the touring side ended the day on 196 for four, a lead of 94 runs as they bid to level the series.         
	Michael Clarke was unbeaten on 34 at the close with Marcus North on seven.         
	Englands day started badly when all-rounder Andrew Flintoff was ruled out through injury.         
	Captain Andrew Strauss, electing to bat first, survived a huge shout for leg before to the first ball of the match but lasted only 17 balls and scored three runs before edging Siddle to third slip where North took a brilliant one-handed catch.         
	Ravi Bopara made one before he tamely prodded Ben Hilfenhaus to Michael Hussey at gully and Ian Bell, on eight, failed to avoid a short ball from Mitchell Johnson and gave wicket-keeper Brad Haddin a simple catch.         
	Paul Collingwood edged a vintage Clark outswinger straight to Ponting at second slip for a duck and Alastair Cooks resistance ended on 30 when he edged Clark to Clarke at first slip.         
	Stuart Broad was caught at short mid-wicket by Simon Katich off Clark for three to leave England reeling on 72 for six at lunch.         
	The procession continued in the afternoon as Graeme Swann, Steve Harmison, James Anderson and Graham Onions fell in quick succession to Siddle, who finished with Test-best figures of five for 21. Clark took three for 18.         
	Watson smashed the first two balls of Australias innings for four but the touring side lost Katich for nought when he fended a rising Harmison delivery to Bopara at leg gully.         
	Ponting batted aggressively from the start, pulling Onionss first ball for six and taking 17 off his opening over. The Australian captain and Watson completed the first 50 partnership of the match off only 69 deliveries.         
	Watson had just reached his third successive half-century since being promoted to open when he was trapped in front by Onions for 51.         
	Ponting moved on to 78 and looked on course for another Test century but he misjudged a full delivery from Broad and was adjudged leg before.         
	Hussey also started well but he too was fooled by Broads line and trapped in front for 10.         
	Clarke was struck a fierce blow on the helmet by a Harmison bouncer but he and North grimly took Australia through to stumps without further loss. (Reuters)

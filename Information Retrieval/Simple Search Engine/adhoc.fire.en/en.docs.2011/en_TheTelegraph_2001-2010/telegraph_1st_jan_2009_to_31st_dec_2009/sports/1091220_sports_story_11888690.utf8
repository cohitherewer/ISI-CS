The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods is US PGA Player of the Year
                                                                                                                       7                                      Woods is US PGA Player of the Year
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Tiger Woods was voted the U.S. PGA Tour player of the year by the players on Friday, the 10th time in his 13 years on Tour that he has won the award.         
	The Tour does not disclose vote totals.         
	Woods started and finished the season the same way  with questions when he would return. He was coming off knee surgery at the beginning of the year, and last week announced an indefinite leave to work on his marriage after admitting to infidelity.         
	In between, he won six Tour events, captured the FedEx Cup and its $10 million bonus, won the money title for the ninth time in his career with over $10.5 million, and had the lowest scoring average for the ninth time.         
	No one else won more than three times on the U.S. PGA Tour. It was only the second time that Woods was voted Player of the Year when he did not win a Major. In a peculiar twist, Woods won in his final start before each of the four Majors.         
	Marc Leishman of Australia was voted tour rookie of the year, becoming the first since Charles Howell III in 2001 to win the award without having won a tournament. Leishman was the only rookie to reach the FedEx Cup finale at the Tour Championship.         
	Players voted on the awards over the last month, with balloting ending on Friday.         
	It was the eighth time that Woods has swept all the major U.S. PGA Tour honours  Byron Nelson Award for the lowest adjusted scoring average (68.05), Arnold Palmer Award for the money title and Jack Nicklaus Award for Player of the Year.         
	The award comes at a time when Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer revealed it is dropping the golf star from US advertising campaigns in the wake of his sex scandal.         
	In a move that follows consulting firm Accenture ending a six-year deal with Woods, Tag Heuer chief executive Jean-Christophe Babin told a Swiss newspaper on Friday that his firm will not use Woods images in US ads for the foreseeable future.         
	We recognise Tiger Woods as a great sportsman but we have to take account of the sensitivity of some consumers in relation to recent events, Babin told the newspaper.         
	The company, a unit of French luxury goods empire LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, would continue to back Woods charity foundation, Babin said.         
	Tag Heuers move mirrors that of Gillette, which last weekend announced it was dropping Woods from commercials during his hiatus, calling it a supportive move.         
	Tag Heuer provided only the latest in a series of blows on a day when Elin Nordegren reportedly hired famed Hollywood divorce lawyer Sorrell Trope and details emerged about a 2007 deal between a US magazine and Woods to keep an extra-marital affair secret.         
	Elin has hired 82-year-old Trope, a noted divorce attorney who has represented such stars as Nicole Kidman, Hugh Grant, Nicolas Cage, Britney Spears and Cary Grant in a 60-year career, according to a US daily.         
	Meanwhile, a business daily reported Friday that a national daily kept quiet about a Woods affair in 2007 in exchange for Woods giving rare access for a cover story to one of its magazines.         
	Under terms of the deal, the daily would not publish photographs and a story on Woods having an extra-marital affair and Woods agreed to a cover and photo spread in the magazine, the daily reported, citing unnamed sources.

    - SAFF Cup to be held in Bangladesh govt aid for asian games preparations           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bhaichung Bhutia                                 
	New Delhi: Praful Patel, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) president-in-charge, Wednesday directed Alberto Colaco to mediate in the Bhaichung Bhutia issue.         
	Speaking to media after the emergency committee meeting of the AIFF here, Patel said general secretary Colaco had been entrusted with the job of finding a solution as soon as possible after talking to both Bhaichung and the Mohun Bagan officials.         
	We have asked Colaco to intervene and resolve the impasse after talking to both parties, Patel said. It cannot go on forever like this, the acting president commented.         
	According to sources, Colaco, who briefed the meeting on the Bhaichung issue, pointed out that the national captain did not miss even one competitive match during the two-and-half-month period that he was involved with a dance programme on one of the private television channels.         
	The AIFF general secretary also said that Bhaichung was apparently suspended for not playing an exhibition match in Jalpaiguri. When Colaco reported that Bhaichung had informed the coach whenever he was to miss a practice session, one of the members said the footballer should have intimated the club secretary.         
	Sources said Colaco is likely to hold a meeting with Bhaichung and Bagan officials after the national teams return from Barcelona. It may be recalled that Colaco had earlier expressed his willingness to mediate between the two parties in case the emergency committee directed him to do so.         
	Colaco also informed that the SAFF Cup, which was to be held in India, would now be played in Bangladesh.         
	The AIFF was finding it difficult to get visas for the Pakistan players, sources said.         
	Moreover, the federation felt it was not possible to host the championships with the money it was receiving from the SAFF confederation.         
	Meanwhile, the AIFF is to receive financial aid to the tune of Rs 10 crore from the government for the national teams preparation for the Asian Games. Patel said he was in talks with the government to get more financial aid for the Goal 2011 project.         
	Major decisions         
	Colaco asked to mediate between Bhaichung Bhutia and Mohun Bagan to resolve the impasse.         
	A three-member committee, consisting of Inder Singh (Punjab), Sunil Bhardwaj (Haryana) and Larsing (Meghalaya) has been formed to initiate the process of the laying of artificial turfs.         
	Praful Patel named chairman of the womens committee.         
	Club licensing process to start immediately.         
	X-rays of footballers should be conducted by states during age group tournaments.

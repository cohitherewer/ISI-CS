                                                   CAB AGM will be held on July 31
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengals (CAB) 78th Annual General Meeting will be held on July 31, its president Jagmohan Dalmiya announced after a working committee meeting on Saturday.         
	The Annual prize distribution ceremony will be held on July 25 and governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi will be the chief guest. Unlike last year, when the prize distribution ceremony was held at the Town Hall, the function will be held within the Eden Gardens premises.         
	Dalmiya said that his being the president was not hampering the chances of Eden Gardens hosting international matches.         
	The tours and programme committee of the BCCI revamped the rotation system in February 2007 and Eden Gardens was the last of the 22 hosting centres. It came up for discussion in the working committee meeting and was then ratified in the general body meeting. Nobody from the previous regime protested then, he said, taking an obvious dig at the last regime, led by Prasun Mukherjee.

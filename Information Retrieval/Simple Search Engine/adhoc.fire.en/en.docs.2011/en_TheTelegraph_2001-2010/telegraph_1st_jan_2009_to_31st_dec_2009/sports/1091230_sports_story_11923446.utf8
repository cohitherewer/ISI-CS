    - Mud-slinging, Allegations of manhandling at DDCA AGM           OUR BUREAU AMP; AGENCIES            Chetan Chauhan in New Delhi, on Tuesday. (PTI)                                 
	New Delhi/Calcutta: Two days after the Kotla pitch fiasco, the Delhi and Districts Cricket Association (DDCA) was once again in the news for wrong reasons, when former Test cricketer Kirti Azad claimed he was insulted and not allowed to express his views during the annual general meeting (AGM) on Tuesday.         
	Azad, a member of the 1983 World Cup-winning team and now a member of Parliament, said he was humiliated by a section of the members when he tried to raise the pitch issue in the meeting. Azad also made several queries on some of the financial dealings of the DDCA.         
	The former Delhi captain first said he was roughed up by a section of the members in the AGM, but later retracted to say he was only stopped from raising uncomfortable questions. He alleged a few others were also roughed up for the same reason.         
	I was not manhandled, but I was interrupted as I wanted to know what happened on Sunday, but a couple of others were roughed up. Supporters of the ruling group objected to my going to the media, attacking the DDCA for Sundays happenings. I stood my ground and said I have every right to express my views, he said.         
	The executive committee should take responsibility for what happened on Sunday and resign en masse. The state of affairs in the DDCA is very disappointing and distressing. I think we have to start cleansing the system. If I begin, then others will follow, Azad added.         
	During the meeting, I raised some pertinent questions about accounts and the formation of the cricket committee... I asked them what the DDCA was doing about cricketing matters. However, a lot of people tried to insult me, an irate Azad told reporters. They claimed to have spent about Rs 30 crore for the stadium since January, but had no answer when I asked which were the specific areas where the funds were used.         
	Ive been a member of the DDCA since 1972 and I have given it everything. So I wont let it go just like that. Ill continue my fight against corruption. Ill raise my questions in the Parliament and even file an RTI, the former India cricketer threatened.         
	Azad held the DDCA entirely responsible for Sundays pitch fiasco. It is the moral responsibility of the DDCA. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) gives them technical assistance. It is the local curator who is responsible for preparing the pitch, he remarked.         
	He alleged two factions within the DDCA were responsible for the mess. Two proxy teams are working in the DDCA. They meet occasionally, only to make sure their personal interests are protected. Even the sports committee is meant to serve their interests. Vijay Bahadur Mishra, the curator, is a member of that committee. He doesnt have any knowledge about pitches, still he was appointed curator, which was amazing. My question is why cant they keep professional people for such jobs?         
	The formation of the sports committee was a disaster, Azad went on. Arun Jaitley (president of DDCA) has always maintained a moral high ground and, I think he should resign after the pitch incident. Jaitley had promised (Virender) Sehwag that the cricket committee will be formed within 15 days, but 15 weeks have passed, Azad alleged.         
	According to DDCA sources, the pitch issue was not listed in the agenda for the AGM, but the chair allowed the matter to be discussed. In total, there was a 12-minute discussion on the pitch, and Azad was allowed to have his say, sources said.         
	Sports secretary Sunil Dev said: Kirti is definitely not telling the truth. Kirti spoke in the meeting at least four times on different issues. There were no problems at all.         
	Dev said he would resign if the allegations of Azad and others were proved to be true. If any of the members who attended the meeting say that something of this sort happened, I will resign immediately. The AGM went off well, he insisted.         
	Another member, however, said an influential member of the sports committee did threaten anyone who asked controversial questions.         
	In fact, Azad was not the only unhappy man after the meeting. Sunil Goel, another member, was also furious. He claimed he had been pushed by the sports committee members. When I asked a few questions about accounts, they pushed me and told me to sit down, Goel said.         
	According to vice-president Chetan Chauhan, no one was manhandled or pushed around.         
	He also said the association has received a letter from the Board of Control for Cricket in India, seeking an explanation. We have received Match Referee Alan Hursts report. The BCCI has asked for an explanation within 14 days, and well be giving a satisfactory reply much before the deadline.

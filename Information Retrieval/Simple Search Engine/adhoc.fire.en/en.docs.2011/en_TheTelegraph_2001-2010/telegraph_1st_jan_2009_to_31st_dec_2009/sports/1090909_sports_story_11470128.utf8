	New York: Kim Clijsters pulled off another upset that didnt really look like one. Now, shes only two wins from a US Open title that hardly anyone could have seen coming.         
	The mother of 18-month-old Jada, Clijsters dismantled 18th-seeded Li Na, 6-2, 6-4 in the quarter finals on Tuesday, punishing Chinas top tennis star with deep, stinging groundstrokes that were part of a game that looked about like it did when she retired two years ago.         
	Or maybe better.         
	Clijsters is back at the US Open for the first time since 2005, when she won the tournament, and now has a winning streak of 12 matches at Flushing Meadows. Her next match will be against the winner between No. 2 Serena Williams and No. 10 Flavia Pennetta.         
	Clijsters has already beaten Venus Williams and two other seeded players and nothing seems like too big a stretch at this point.         
	Im glad I got through it again, stayed focused on my game, Clijsters said. I wanted to be aggressive and I think thats what helped winning those important points today.         
	Meanwhile, Americas newest heroine, Melanie Oudin, continued her dream-like run with another shocking upset on Monday (as reported in Tuesdays Late City edition) while top seed Roger Federer forged closer to his 16th Grand Slam crown.         
	Mentally, Im staying in there with them the whole time, and Im not giving up at all, the 17-year-old Oudin said after reaching her first major quarter final with a 1-6, 7-6, 6-3 victory over Russian Nadia Petrova.         
	So if theyre going to beat me, theyre going to beat me, because Im not going to go anywhere.         
	On an unseasonably cool day at Flushing Meadows, the Russians concluded their worst grand slam performance in nearly a decade, while the US men had their worst showing in New York since tennis turned professional in 1968.         
	Federer, however, was his usual brilliant self, blitzing 14th-seeded Spaniard Tommy Robredo, who was sent off bewildered after being on the receiving end of a 7-5, 6-2, 6-2 wallop.         
	He was playing so good, Robredo said of the five-time Open winner. When he plays like this, its tough.         
	Fourth seed Novak Djokovic had an easy time bouncing 15th seed Czech Radek Stepanek 6-1, 6-3, 6-3.         
	Denmarks Caroline Wozniacki managed the days biggest upset when she toppled former champion and sixth seed Svetlana Kuznetsova 2-6, 7-6, 7-6 to reach her first Grand Slam quarter final.         
	The ninth seed will face Oudin in the quarters and the 19-year-old has no illusions about who will receive the crowds backing.         
	Its going to be tough, especially also with the whole crowd supporting her, Wozniacki said.But Im just going to go out there and enjoy.         
	Oudin has beaten four Russians so far, helping send the tennis power home early.         
	Having started with 15 women and eight men in the singles draws, all were beaten by day eight of the championships  making it the first time since Wimbledon 2000 that no Russian reached the last eight of a Grand Slam singles event.         
	American John Isners 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 loss to 10th seed Fernando Verdasco of Spain marked the first time since 1968 that no American male advanced to the Open quarter finals.         
	I didnt really care, the 24-year-old said Isner of his role carrying the US hopes.I didnt really think too much of it. I wanted to keep it going.         
	The story of the Open so far is the diminutive Oudin, whose never-say-die style of play and bubbly demeanour has made her the darling of Flushing Meadows.         
	Its really a great feeling, the 70th-ranked Oudin said of her support.         
	 Everyone stood up when I had my first match point. Just when I won the second set, a standing ovation. Its crazy how many people are cheering for me and supporting me.         
	Oudin opened her dizzying run by defeating Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, then shocked fourth seed Elena Dementieva and former champion Maria Sharapova.         
	She insists there are no secrets on how to beat a Russian.         
	I dont think they had weaknesses, she said. Every single match has been so competitive and so close, and Ive been able to pull it out in the end.         
	Oudin scampers around the court like her idol, Belgiums former world No. 1 Justine Henin. She chased down everything Petrova threw at her.         
	When you do it for the first time you feel so excited and everything is so new and you have absolutely nothing to lose and you go and you do it, Petrova said of Oudin.         
	Shes on a roll, you know. She goes, enjoys it, crowd is behind her. Shes having a blast out there.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brothers win first World Cup for Italy
                                                                                                                       7                                        Brothers win first World Cup for Italy
                  Francesco and Edoardo Molinari of Italy with the World Cup in Shenzhen on Sunday                     
	Shenzhen: Brothers Francesco and Edoardo Molinari edged a dramatic three-way final round tussle with Sweden and Ireland to claim a first World Cup of Golf for Italy by one stroke at the 55th World Cup of Golf Sunday.         
	The duo ended the $5.5 million tournament with a total of 16-under 272 after mixing three birdies against an equal number of bogeys, all of which came in the back nine.         
	The final round was played in the foursomes format, in which players take alternate shots to complete a hole. Starting the day tied ninth, the Indians played out a flawless front-nine with birdies on the second and fourth holes. But their form took a dip in the backward journey as they stumbled to bogeys on the 10th, 13th and 18th.         
	Although, they found a birdie on the 17th but it was wasnt enough to fetch a top-10 finish on the leaderboard.         
	Meanwhile, a poor back-nine marred their day as the Indian team of Jeev Milkha Singh and Jyoti Randhawa turned in a modest even-par 72, their worst card of the week, to sign off tied 14th.         
	The first siblings to lift the John Jay Hopkins trophy in the 55 versions of the event, the Italians found their putting touch on the back nine to finish with a four-under-par 68 for a total of 29-under for the $5.5 million tournament at Mission Hills.         
	Irelands Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell, who had led all week after an opening 58, carded an error-strewn 70 to share second with defending champion Swedes Henrik Stenson and Robert Karlsson, who shot a 69.         
	Ireland, who had started the final day foursomes with a one-shot cushion, were drawn into the pack when McIlroy went into the trees with his drive at the third.         
	The Ulstermen looked to have recovered their nerves, however, with a string of four birdies from the fourth to surge three shots clear.         
	Sweden, who shot a final-round 63 to win last year, had picked up two shots before dropping their first and only shot of the tournament at the eighth. Calamity struck for the Irish around the turn, however, when they chalked up two more bogeys at the eighth and 10th holes, the latter when McIlroy missed a two-foot par putt.         
	The Molinaris, meanwhile, had gone through 10 holes at a steady one-under before three successive birdie putts from Francesco, the second a curling beauty from 30 feet, broke the three-way tie then put the Italians ahead by two.         
	That was going to be easier said than done and the Swedes and Irish cut the lead to one shot with birdies at the 15th before more drama at the 18th. First Stensons long birdie putt tracked around the lip of the hole and out and then Edoardos second shot went into a greenside bunker, while the Irish carved out a birdie chance.         
	World No. 37 Francesco, however, came up with a beautiful wedge to two feet and, when McDowells putt came up short, Edoardo had a simple par putt for the championship.         
	World No. 7 Stenson, whose partner Karlsson lost a playoff to Eduardo at the Dunlop Phoenix in Japan last week, blamed his poor putting for Swedens finish. (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tendulkar advice for Pietersen
                                                     Tendulkar advice for Pietersen
                  Sachin Tendulkar                     
	London: Sachin Tendulkar said he can foresee Kevin Pietersen under tremendous pressure of expectations during the Ashes and advised the English swashbuckler not to think about the high hopes his nation has from him while batting.         
	He (Pietersen) cant be thinking of carrying the hopes of a nation when hes walking out to bat. All the England batsmen have to go out there and express themselves and be fearless in their approach, Tendulkar said.         
	Thats what I did when I started in Test cricket. I was thinking about feeling at home. I had to follow the bowler as best as I could and react accordingly. I focussed on that and didnt think anything else, he added.         
	Here to enjoy a holiday with his family, Tendulkar said was looking forward to some fireworks from Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff in the five-Test series next month. Despite Australias recent slump of form, Tendulkar feels it will be tough for England to win back the Ashes if the dynamic duo of Flintoff and Pietersen fail to fire.         
	Australia, who whitewashed England 5-0 in the last Ashes series Down Under, made a shocking first-round exit from the ongoing World Twenty20 after losing both their group matches.         
	The Aussies are presently enjoying a two-week rest before they head back to England for the first Test at Cardiff, starting July 8.         
	England rely heavily on a couple of players, Pietersen and Flintoff. The others have to step up as well but they are the key ones, Tendulkar told reporters here Friday, at the launch of Tendulkar Opus, an 800-page coffee table book, comprising previously unpublished family pictures and rare memorabilia of the master blaster.         
	Asked who is the favourite to win this years Ashes, he said: Australia have aggressive players and a well-balanced bowling attack. But I cannot say who will win, its a tough question. The last Ashes in England in 2005, which England won 2-1, was one of the best I have ever seen. It was great for every cricket follower and I dont see anything else happening this time.         
	Tendulkar, however, cautioned Pietersen against taking too much burden on his shoulders. The 36-year-old right-hander also said that he feels humbled by the love and affection of over one billion Indians who have supported him all through his career.         
	I feel very humbled at the adulation of over one billion people of India who have supported me all through. Without the support of my family, it would not have been possible for me to achieve my dream. My family has played a big role in my career, he added.

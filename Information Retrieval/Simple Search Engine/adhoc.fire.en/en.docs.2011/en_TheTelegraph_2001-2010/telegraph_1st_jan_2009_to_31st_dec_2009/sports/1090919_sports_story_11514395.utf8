The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Five-official experiment starts in Europa League
                                                   Five-official experiment starts in Europa League
                      
	Lille: Footballs experiment of extra match officials kicked off in the inaugural Europa League on Thursday, a new venture which Uefa president Michel Platini hopes will end calls for replay technology.         
	For the first time in a European club tournament, referees stepped onto the field with four assistants instead of the standard two linesmen, with the two extra officials stationed behind the goal lines to catch incidents or make decisions the ref may not be able to see.         
	The system is only in its infancy, but it already promises to split opinion  just like the calls for technology are opposing football traditionalists like Platini against ardent advocates of video replays.         
	Its just the beginning, but I think we will get used to the new system, Lille forward Gervinho said on Thursday. The most important thing is that president Platini finds solutions and that football improves.         
	Although only an experiment, the system could become the norm if it is successful. However, if incorrect decisions are made even with the extra pairs of eyes, the calls for video replays will likely only intensify.         
	The extra officials were on duty at each of the 24 matches as the Europa League group phase began.         
	For difficult situations there is now more of a possibility to see what has happened, but only the future will tell, Valencia coach Unai Emery said.    THURSDAY'S RESULTS

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England have the edge, says Chappell
                                                   England have the edge, says Chappell
                      
	New Delhi: Australia have put together a ridiculous squad which gives England a distinct edge in the forthcoming Ashes series, according to former Aussie captain Ian Chappell.         
	I thought it was ridiculous, Chappell said of Australias team selection, pointing to Phillip Hughes shaky form.         
	Certainly not going with a third opening batsman is just asking for trouble. There seems to be this widespread feeling that Hughes is fine, hes going to be a star. Well, hes only played three Tests. Hes got a very unorthodox technique that could come unglued at any time. If it happens to be a wet summer in England he could be in a bit of trouble, Chappell told a website.         
	Chappell said a comparison between the bowling units of both the sides convinced him that Andrew Strauss and his men would hold sway in the five-match series.         
	If youre looking for clues as to who might win, I always look at the bowling attacks. Generally you can go with the team with the best attack. At the moment England certainly have got it. A bit will depend on Flintoff and his fitness, but if hes fit and can stand up for all five Tests then England have definitely got the better attack, and a better balanced attack. On that basis I would have them slight favourites, he said.         
	Former England captain Tony Greig also doubted Australias ability to cope with the English attack and said, Id go for England, but only by a whisker. Theres always so much tension around the first Ashes Test so temperament could play a very important part, he said.         
	Even as Australia might go in with a four-pronged pace attack since off-spinner Nathan Hauritz looked off-colour, Chappell said no team can win a Test relying on part-time spinners.         
	I just dont believe part-time spinners can do the job for you. They should have learned the lesson after what they tried in India and that was an abject failure. You might get away with it on occasions. You shouldnt win Tests against decent teams relying on part-time spinners, said Chappell.

                                                   Rhythm more relevant in T20 cricket: Vengsarkar
    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  Chief selector during Indias T20 win in 2007 shares his thoughts             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              Dilip Vengsarkar, at a promotional, with the World Twenty20 trophy      
	Nottingham: Former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar, whod been the chief selector when Team India won the inaugural World T20, in 2007, spoke to The Telegraph in the lead-up to the second edition.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q How did you and your colleagues approach the job of picking the squad for the maiden World T20? After all, it was the first time that a T20 squad was being selected exclusively...         
	A Among the big nations, I think we were the last to embrace T20 cricket and, so, there were no domestic performances to go by... In fact, India had played only one T20 International previously (in South Africa)... I was in England when the selection had to be done and it was via a teleconference... My own belief was that we needed youngsters who could bring energy to the team... Those whod be quick on the field... We needed big hitters and all-rounders and plenty of thought was given to picking the bowlers... My colleagues were thinking on the same lines and 70 per cent of the players I had in mind were on their minds as well.         
	If youll put the record straight... Did Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid opt out or was it suggested to them that they wouldnt make the cut?         
	Theyd opted out themselves, much before the selection process was initiated... Zaheer (Khan) too.         
	Frankly, how confident were you of Team India doing well?         
	I realised the first few matches would be important as rhythm, perhaps, is more relevant in T20 cricket... Its important to get into the winning mode... That mindset makes a difference... The first match, against Scotland, was washed out... However, we won the next, beating Pakistan via the bowl-out... It was a great start.         
	Looking back, what made the difference for India?         
	We had bowlers who could bat and batters who could bowl... The captain had options and it reminded me of our 1983 World Cup squad... Then too we had all-rounders and the captain wasnt short on options.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhonis leadership stood out...         
	I had high expectations and wasnt disappointed... Dhoni made the right changes and carried the team with him... He was brilliant.         
	What made you give the captaincy to Dhoni?         
	Went by intuition... Also, I liked Dhonis body language and liked the way he carried himself off the field as well.         
	Besides the trophy, what did India gain from the World T20s first edition?         
	Lots... T20 wouldnt have caught on had India not won that edition... For any sport or format to become a rage, the national team needs to win internationally and Team India did... Initially, of course, everybody in India had treated T20 with disdain, with some even saying it was baseball and not cricket! The fear was that young cricketers would get spoilt.         
	What are your expectations this time?         
	I hope the long IPL hasnt taken its toll... Ideally, it should be a 10-team affair, with each franchise playing the other once before the semis and final... That way, the IPL could finish in 25-30 days... Talking of our chances in the World T20, well, fitness has become a key factor...         
	Today, what is Team Indias biggest challenge?         
	To get it right in the first couple of matches, thereby quickly getting into rhythm... We shouldnt be overconfident and draw a lesson from the defeat at Bangladeshs hands in the (50-over) 2007 World Cup.         
	Who are the players who could make the biggest difference?         
	Almost all are such good cricketers... Im not sure of (Virender) Sehwags fitness, but he and Yuvraj (Singh) have it in them to make a huge impact... Sehwag in the first 10 and Yuvraj in the last 10... Ishant Sharma is another one who could impact big... I expect the spinners (Harbhajan Singh, Pragyan Ojha) to make headlines.         
	Dhoni and Co. lost the first warm-up match (to New Zealand), but beat Pakistan in the next. Whats your reading?         
	Warm-up matches arent to be taken lightly... The win against Pakistan was emphatic (by nine wickets) and the team must build on the confidence gained at The Oval.         
	Hasnt the success of oldies like Anil Kumble and Adam Gilchrist in the just-ended IPL proved that age has little to do with T20, generally seen as more suited for the young ones?         
	Definitely... The way I see it, everything depends on fitness and mental attitude... Anil and Gilly were playing for pride and didnt let their game drop one bit... They wanted to win, which is the attitude to possess.         
	Will you be in England during the World T20?         
	Yes, Im associated with a Pepsi campaign... I should be at Trent Bridge on Monday and at Lords on the 12th.         
	Would you have enjoyed playing T20?         
	(Laughs) Absolutely... Allows batsmen to execute extraordinary shots and I wouldve loved such freedom.         
	The last one: Is T20 going to hurt both ODIs and Test cricket?         
	Look, the administrators have a huge role to play... Theyve got to ensure that Test cricket remains the ultimate... Because of the moolah factor, T20 shouldnt be overdone... That could be detrimental to the development of quality cricketers. The programming, clearly, has to be carefully structured.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lajong ready for the challenge
                                                   Lajong ready for the challenge
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sportings clash against Lajong FC of Shillong, in the double header on the opening day of the IFA Shield Sunday, may well be termed a battle between a club who have been relegated from the I-League and newcomers who have shown enough promise and determination to become the first club from the northeast to make it to the elite tier of national football.         
	Mohammedan Sporting, after all, are one of the big boys of Calcutta. But Lajong, under the guidance of coach Stanley Rozario, could prove to be a thorn in the flesh for many of the title aspirants.         
	The Shillong clubs desperation to make a mark in national football was evident in Rozarios words: We have been preparing well for this meet A 45-day camp in the build up to this tournament should serve us well. Nothing is impossible in soccer and Im sure that my boys can give tough competitions to the big clubs.         
	He also refused to believe there was any kind of pressure on his side. Its true that we are a new team But Im looking forward to seeing how these youngsters prove themselves on the big stage. So, honestly speaking, theres no pressure on us and its rather an interesting phase for us where we hope to learn much, he said.         
	In skipper Aibor Khongjee, Marlanki Suiting and Daniel Bdemi, Rozario has players who can help the team with their experience of club football in Calcutta, but Lajongs real asset is the squads physical fitness. It has to be seen how Mohammedan Sporting handle the boys from Shillong, who are natural athletes. Rozario said much the same thing: My players are all physically fit and strong They have an innate talent.         
	For Mohammedan Sporting, it will be the beginning of another endeavour to reclaim lost glory. Relegated each time they have made it to the elite tier, the black and white brigade would like to begin its season purposefully.         
	Coach Shabbir Ali looked confident during practice at the club ground on Saturday.         
	We would play to win And I wouldnt say that we would play a cautious game to get a measure of the opponents first. My sole objective would be to go for goals, he said.         
	Downplaying their victory in the recently concluded Independence Cup, Shabbir said: It wasnt such a big tournament and the challenge in the IFA Shield will be much tougher.         
	The inclusion of Brazilian striker Edu in their ranks should give the team the much-needed fillip in the absence of the injured Theo. Veteran Dipendu Biswas will partner Edu upfront and a lot will depend on the duos efficiency against a fast and agile team.         
	In the other match of the day, Pune FC take on Mumbais Air India at the Howrah Stadium.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ranty, Beto ruled out versus Muharaq today
                                                   Ranty, Beto ruled out versus Muharaq today
                      
	Panaji: Dempo will be forced to field a new strike force when they take on Al Muharaq of Bahrain in return match of the AFC Cup at Nehru Stadium in Margao on Tuesday.         
	Dempo will miss the service of Roberto Da Silva Beto and Ranty Martins, who could have formed a lethal combination upfront for the opponents, for double booking.         
	Dempo, who lost the I-League title to Churchill Brothers and finished fourth in the championship, have put up good performance so far in the ongoing continental contest. They have won two matches and drew one to lead the group-E with seven points in their kitty.         
	Colaco was disappointed after Dempo failed to win their earlier match against Al Muharaq and blamed the referee for his biased job. The encounter saw the Baharain side score a last-minute goal during the stoppage time to hold Dempo 1-1.         
	Defending champions Al Muharaq, who arrived here on Saturday evening and had two practice sessions to get acclimatised to the hot and humid weather, have come without their three key players  international mid-fielder Mohammed Salmeen, Anwar Yuseef and defender Fahad Al Hardhan.         
	Al Muharaaq are struggling to find their form and have managed three points from as many games. Al Muharaaq had drubbed previous editions semi-finalists Dempo 4-0 when they met last year. The visitors will be looking to their talismanic Brazilian striker Leadson da Silva, who had scored all the four goals against the Indian side last year.         
	Al Muharaaq coach Salman Shareeda feels that Dempo are one of the strongest teams in the tournament but at the same time is quite optimistic about a result in their favour. (PTI)

                                                   Agency defends regime
                      
	New Delhi: Reacting to the Indian cricketers opposition to its whereabouts clause, the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) on Sunday said the anti-doping code was framed for the effective fight against doping, which has been accepted by a large number of international sporting organisations.         
	The code has been accepted by 571 sporting organisations which includes the International Olympic Committee, the International Paralympic Committee and the International Sports Federation.         
	This code has been approved by 191 countries, and also by the Unesco, Wada president John Fahey said.         
	The Indian cricketers have refused to sign the clause which requires them to furnish information about their location three months in advance for out of competition tests, claiming that it infringes on their privacy.         
	Fahey justified the anti-doping code, saying it was meant for the effective and harmonious fight against the menace of doping.         
	These (contents of the code) are model rules meant for the effective and harmonious fight against doping.         
	These are the model rules applicable world-wide, he said from Lausanne. (PTI)

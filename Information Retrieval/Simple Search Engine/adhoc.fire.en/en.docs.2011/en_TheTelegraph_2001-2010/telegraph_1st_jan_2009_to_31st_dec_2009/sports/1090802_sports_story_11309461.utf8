                                                   India win 2nd hockey Test
                      
	Birmingham: India bounced back in style from their first match loss by recording a 4-3 victory over England in the second of their three-match hockey Test series here.         
	The Indians produced a fine display of speed and skill to erase a two-goal deficit and notched up their first win of the European tour at the University of Birmingham.         
	Arjun Halappa (35th minute), Dhananjay Mahadik (41st), Rajpal Singh (43rd) and Gurvinder Chandi (65th min) scored for India, while Englands marksmen were Ashley Jackson (22nd and 69th) and Jonty Clarke (26th min).         
	England, who won the first Test 3-1 on Wednesday, started aggressively but met with stiff resistance from the Indian defenders, particularly from Sardar Singh in a his new role of sweeper back.         
	Vikram Pillay and Gurbaj Singh joined the Haryana Police deputy superintendent in thwarting the initial England forays amidst light drizzle accompanied by a chilly wind.         
	The hosts nearly took the lead as early as the sixth minute when Simon Egerton broke through the middle but was foiled by Indian goalkeeper Adrian Dsouza who saved a shot high to his right.         
	In the eighth minute, India had their first opportunity to score but Tushar Khandker failed to control SV Sunils powerful cross to the back post.         
	England, who earned six penalty corners in the first half, had to wait for the last one to net the opener. Ashley Jackson got it spot on in the 22nd minute as his powerful flick finally beat Dsouza.         
	The home team could have doubled up a minute later but Simon Egerton, teed up by James Tindall, pushed wide.         
	India went into full throttle but soon fell into further arrears as England built up on a turnover in the 26th minute.         
	Matt Dalys shot was well saved by Dsouza low to his left but before Bimal Lakra could react Jonty Clark did brilliantly to knock home the loose ball.         
	India got their opening goal at the stroke of half time from their first penalty corner after Chandi was blocked inside the circle.         
	However, Dhananjay Mahadiks flick was taken by custodian James Fair dangerously resulting in another penalty corner. Arjun Halappa fired a low flick into the bottom right corner to give a 2-1 score at half time.         
	India returned for the second half with renewed vigour and they turned the game on its head with two goals in quick succession.         
	Sardar Singh was outstanding with his crisp passes to Birendra Lakra, Rajpal, Chandi and Pillay as the quartet gave the English defence no respite.         
	Chandi moved into the circle with a solo and an obstruction lead to Indias third penalty corner in the 41st minute, from which Mahadik scored the equaliser to the delight of the huge India supporters at the stands.         
	Two minutes later, it was the turn of Indian captain Rajpal Singh to celebrate as he gave India the lead. Standing in for the indisposed Sandeep Singh, Rajpal knocked home at the back post after a free flowing move down the left flank from Prabodh Tirkey, Halappa and Chandi.         
	England responded immediately with two penalty corners but Jacksons efforts were thwarted by Dsouza. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Corruption has no place in football, says Roger Milla
                                                   Corruption has no place in football, says Roger Milla
  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -   Africas icon picks Brazil as the favourites for 2010 Cup         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                            Roger Milla     
	Zurich: A call from Cameroons President made Roger Milla come out of retirement and play in the 1990 World Cup. He was 38 then. The rest, as they say, is history and the African nation went as far as the quarter finals. Milla, of course, played a huge role.         
	Two decades later, people still talk of Millas goals and his unique celebratory dance after each one of them. Now a brand ambassador for Coca-Cola, an old partner of Fifa, he spoke to The Telegraph here on Monday afternoon.         
	Milla isnt comfortable conversing in English and, so, he spoke in fluent French and a lady (Danielle Gree) did the translations. The interview was conducted at the truly mind-blowing Fifa House.         
	Owing to time constraints, the remarkably fit Milla could only speak for around 20 minutes.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On being an icon         
	(Grins) Ive handled the pressures and expectations well, I think... Remember, I come from a simple family.         
	Life changing after the 1990 World Cup in Italy         
	Well, yes, life did change... I not only scored, but danced my way into the hearts of millions... Im an ambassador for the President of Cameroon, Paul Biya... Im also an ambassador for the UNs Aids programme... Then, I happen to run a Foundation which, among others, takes care of orphans... All this happened after 1990.         
	His idol         
	Pele, the one and only Pele.         
	Heroes outside football         
	Nelson Mandela and my President... Ive learnt a lot from both.         
	The No.1 challenge for football         
	Id say its ensuring fair play... Fair play from not only the players, but (team) officials and referees as well... Corruption of any kind, clearly, has no place in football.         
	Cameroons campaign in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers         
	Look, weve got two tough matches coming up, against Togo and Morocco... Having said that, we should count on our players to deliver... Were already heading our group.... A World Cup in Africa without Cameroon wouldnt be a disaster, but the tournament would still miss something.         
	Favourites to win next years World Cup         
	Brazil, theyve been playing a good brand of football. Right now, I cant think of any other team.         
	His 1990 trip to Calcutta         
	Your city? I have fond memories... Id been there on an invitation... I remember having met Mother Teresa...         
	Suggestions for the football community in India         
	Have a good system at the grassroots level... As for the footballers, theyve got to work harder. Success doesnt come easy.         
	Message for young footballers         
	Firstly, respect the game and respect other footballers... If you respect the game, then youll get back respect... Secondly, youve got to work hard... Youve got to train physically and tactically and youve got to do that every day... Dont look for shortcuts.         
	Finally, whether he has met the hip-swinging diva, Shakira         
	(Laughs) Oh, oh... Ive liked her performances (on videos), but havent met her as yet... Actually, now that youve asked me, Id love to meet her!

	Agartala: Bengal faltered in the Vijay Hazare Trophy final for the second time in a row as Tamil Nadu put in a clinical performance to win by 66 runs at the Maharaja Bir Bikram Stadium, here on Monday.         
	Last year, Bengal had lost to Saurashtra in the final. For Tamil Nadu, it was their third title in the national one-dayers. They had won the title in 2002-03 and were declared joint winners, along with Uttar Pradesh, in 2004-05.         
	On Monday, Tamil Nadus job was half-done when they posted a mammoth 284 for six after deciding to bat first. It was left-hand opener Abhinav Mukunds day as he notched up a superb 118, his first in List A cricket.         
	Bengal were guilty of giving away too many runs while bowling. Then a bad start while chasing ensured that they didnt even reach close. Chasing 285, Bengal were reduced to 18 for two, with Sreevats Goswami and Debabrata Das dismissed cheaply. They never recovered from the dismal start and were finally shot out for 218 in 45.2 overs.         
	Bengals batting mainstay Manoj Tiwary played his part with a commanding 76 off 87 balls but it proved futile with the lack of support from the other end.         
	Bengal looked in the hunt for a brief period when captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla stitched together a 43-run partnership off 41 balls for the fourth wicket with Tiwary, but Shuklas unfortunate run-out practically ended all hopes for Bengal. Both batsmen found themselves at the same end and the miscommunication between the two proved very costly for Bengal.         
	Tiwary, who looked in great touch, played some flowing drives and effective sweep shots before dragging one from V. Yo Mahesh onto his stumps.         
	Mondays final once again showed the lack of depth in Bengals batting. The total, though the highest on this ground in the tournament, was not impossible to chase down on a good batting wicket.         
	Both captains had talked about sensible batting on the eve of the match. Tamil Nadus Mukund was a perfect example of application on Monday. The southpaw hit 12 boundaries and a huge six during his 140-ball knock. He played only two false shots during his innings but luckily for him both his edges flew between the wicketkeeper and the slip.         
	His exquisite cover-drives off the Bengal fast bowlers were a treat to watch. He handled the spinners well, too, and treated them on merit. The curator also deserves some credit as the pitch played true, unlike the earlier matches, and the ball came on to the bat nicely.         
	Both Bengal spinners  left-armer Iresh Saxena and off-spinner Priyankar Mukherjee  extracted decent turn off the wicket. Mukund played both the spinners on merit and was ready to play the waiting game. He, however, punished them whenever they erred in line or length. His only six came off the off-spinner when he disdainfully dismissed Mukherjees half-tracker over the mid-wicket boundary.         
	Mukund fell to Ashok Dinda while looking for quick runs in the 46th over. But by then his side were in a strong position at 233 for four.He skied one to Saxena at mid-wicket while attempting a pull shot.         
	Mukunds dismissal brought S Suresh Kumar to the crease. The right-hander played a gem of an innings and catapulted the Tamil Nadu total to their eventual score of 284 for six.         
	Tamil Nadu, at one point, seemed to be heading towards a total of around 260.         
	Suresh hit four massive sixes and a boundary in his 18-ball unbeaten knock of 41. Two of his sixes came in the last over of the innings off Shuklas bowling. Tamil Nadu scored more than 90 runs in the last 10 overs of their innings and that probably proved decisive.         
	Shukla made a glaring mistake while handling his bowlers. His calculations definitely went haywire as he under-bowled left-arm spinner Saxena, the most economical of the Bengal bowlers.         
	The Bengal pacers also had a forgettable outing. Though Dinda picked up three wickets for 52 off his 10 overs, most of his wickets came at the fag end of the innings while the Tamil Nadu batsmen went for quick runs. Ranadeb Bose went for 52 runs off just seven overs and picked up one wicket.

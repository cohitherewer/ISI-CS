The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan move to include Lankans faces barrier
                                                   Bagan move to include Lankans faces barrier
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) late on Monday decided to call an emergency tournament committee meeting regarding Mohun Bagans surprise move to register the Sri Lankan duo of Chamina Vaas and Tillekeratne Dilshan for the local tournaments.         
	Bagans JC Mukherjee Trophy Twenty20 quarter final, scheduled for Wednesday, was also postponed.         
	There was some confusion regarding the registration of the foreigners. So we decided to call an emergency meeting of the tournament committee to sort out the issue. In this regard, Mohun Bagans JC Mukherjee quarter final on Wednesday has also been postponed, CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey said.         
	We want to clear all the confusion.         
	However, Mohun Bagan assistant secretary Srinjoy Bose claimed there were no clear instructions in the CAB Memorandum and Rules regarding the registration of foreigners.         
	We have asked the CAB to clarify the decision. There is a precedence of former Bangladesh cricketer Mohammed Rafique playing in the P. Sen Trophy. So why is so much fuss being created about Vaas? Bose said.         
	The CAB claims P. Sen Trophy is an invitational tournament and the registration rules are different.         
	The exact rules regarding registration, however, couldnt be confirmed.         
	We want the issue to be solved quickly and hope the cricket fans will catch a glimpse of Vaas, the Bagan official said.         
	The 35-year old Vaass arrival, scheduled for Tuesday night, has also been postponed.         
	Bagans rivals, however, are not too keen on foreign players yet. Each club can register 25 players for the season and the last date of registration with the CAB is January 15.         
	Bagan beat Customs by eight wickets on Monday to ensure a place in the quarter finals of the knock-out tournament. Captain Manoj Tiwary hit an unbeaten 52 off 28 balls to guide his team home.

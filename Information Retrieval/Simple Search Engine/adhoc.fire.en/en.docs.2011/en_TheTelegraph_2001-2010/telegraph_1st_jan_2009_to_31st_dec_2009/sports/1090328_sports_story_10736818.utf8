The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No more global relays
                                                   No more global relays
            NEW YORK TIMES AMP; AGENCIES                      
	The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has decided to bar future organising committees from taking the torch relay international. The move comes as a reaction to the protest-marred torch relay preceding the Beijing Games last summer.         
	The IOC hopes to avoid the ugly scenes that erupted in San Francisco, Paris and London last year when anti-China protesters attempted to douse the Olympic flame, forcing the relay to be stopped and sometimes rerouted as the enterprise descended into chaos. The protests centred on Chinas violent crackdown on dissenters in Tibet.         
	Beijing organisers had hoped to make the torch relay a celebratory part of its Olympic coming-out party. Making things worse, however, China staged part of the relay through Tibet, requiring a massive security presence amid the turmoil.         
	The ban begins officially for the 2014 winter Games in Sochi, Russia, but organisers of the 2010 Vancouver Games planned an all-Canada route and the 2012 London Games decided to keep the relay within Great Britain.         
	The IOC announced the change at its three-day meetings in Denver, but said it doesnt require an adjustment of the contracts for host cities. There was no requirement for cities to take the relays internationally, but in recent years, the cities would request such a tour.         
	Gilbert Felli, the IOCs executive director for the Olympic Games, said the IOC started recognising risks during the relay before the Athens Games.         
	However, at the time, Beijing had already started its planning for the international torch relay, and we had accepted to do it accordingly, Felli said. We have seen on the debrief of the torch relay that the risk was there, and it is why the IOC has decided not to do it.

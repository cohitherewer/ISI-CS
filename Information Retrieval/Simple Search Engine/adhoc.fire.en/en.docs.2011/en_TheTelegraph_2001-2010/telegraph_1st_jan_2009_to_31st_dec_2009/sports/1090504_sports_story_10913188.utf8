	Johannesburg: Jacques Kallis and Robin Uthappa scored breezy half-centuries and guided the Royal Challengers Bangalore to a mammoth nine-wicket victory over the Mumbai Indians in their Indian Premier League match here on Sunday.         
	In reply to Mumbai Indians 149 for four, Kallis (69 off 59 balls) and Uthappa (66 off 42) made the run chase look easy, reaching 150 for one with 11 balls to spare.         
	Kallis hit five fours and two sixes while Uthappa scored eight boundaries and two huge sixes in their unbroken 126-run partnership that gave the Bangalore side their third successive win in the tournament and helped them improve to fourth in the table with eight points from eight matches.         
	They also proved that there were no demons in the wicket after the Mumbai Indians made heavy weather at the start of their innings.         
	Earlier, Sanath Jayasuriya hit 52 and Dwayne Bravo scored 50 not out at the Wanderers Stadium to take the Mumbai side to a respectable total. The Royal Challengers South African medium-pacer Dillon du Preez took three wickets in two overs on his IPL debut. The Mumbai side slumped to 23 for three by the sixth over. Bravo and Abhishek Nayar (29 not out from 20 balls) added an unbroken stand of 66 in less than six overs late in the innings.         
	The 27-year-old Du Preez finished with three for 32 off four overs. (Agencies)

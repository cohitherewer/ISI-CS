                                                   A humbling experience for England
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The England cricket team returned home on Saturday after a two-day visit to Flanders Field in Belgium as part of their preparations for the forthcoming Ashes series against Australia.         
	The 16-member Ashes squad and the management team visited war graves, laid wreathes at the famous Menin Gate in Ieper and took part in a memorial service to commemorate those servicemen who lost their lives in World War.I.         
	The team began their visit by attending a service at the Oxford Road cemetery close to Ieper where a special tribute was paid to those England cricketers who perished in the conflict. As part of the service, England fast bowler Stuart Broad laid a specially made stone cricket ball at the graveside of former Kent and England left arm spinner Colin Blythe who died at the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917.         
	The team also visited the Tyne Cot cemetery where more than 12,000 Allied soldiers are buried and attended the daily service held at the Menin Gate where wreathes were laid by Andrew Strauss, Ravi Bopara and Alastair Cook before The Last Post was played and singer Sean Ruane delivered a rendition of Jerusalem.         
	The two-day visit concluded with an opportunity for the players to see trenches preserved from World War I and take part in a team meeting to discuss tactics and strategy ahead of the Ashes series.         
	England captain Andrew Strauss said: Its important to take a step back from cricket at times and this visit was a deeply moving and humbling experience for all of the players and management. We learned a great deal about the sacrifices made by a previous generation of England cricketers and I would like to thank the people of Ieper for making us so welcome.         
	England team director Andy Flower said: This visit was part of ongoing efforts designed to broaden horizons and learn more about the role of leadership and team ethics.         
	Everyone came away from the visit with a greater understanding of what it really means to stand shoulder to shoulder and fight for your country.         
	We hope it will help strengthen our own bonds within the team as we prepare for what should be a very exciting Ashes series.

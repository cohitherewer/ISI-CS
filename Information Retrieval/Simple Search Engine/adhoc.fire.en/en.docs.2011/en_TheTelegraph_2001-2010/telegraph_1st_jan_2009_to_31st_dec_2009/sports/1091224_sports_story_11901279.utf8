The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bond quits Test cricket
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bond quits Test cricket
                      
	Wellington: New Zealand fast bower Shane Bond retired from Test cricket on Wednesday, citing physical wear and tear, but said he would continue to play shorter forms of the game.         
	Bond, 34, has been plagued by injuries during a seven-year international career in which he played only 18 Tests, finishing with 87 wickets at an average of 22.09.         
	He played his last Test against Pakistan at Dunedin in late November, taking eight wickets, then missed the remaining two Tests of that series because of an abdominal strain.         
	The Test at Dunedin was also his first in two years because of injuries and a brief involvement with the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL).         
	Bond said he was disappointed to quit Test cricket but hoped to continue playing one day and Twenty20 internationals.         
	The hardest thing is that Ive always considered myself a Test bowler, and it was such a great feeling to be back in the team last month and playing Test match cricket with the Black Caps, he said.         
	Bond said after a series of injuries, including a serious back strain, he was no longer able to take the physical toll of Test cricket.         
	Looking back, so many of my injuries have come during Test cricket.         
	Unfortunately my body just wont let me continue to play at that level, given the workload and demands of test cricket, he said.         
	I dont want to end on an injury and I am absolutely committed to playing for the Black Caps.           (AGENCIES)

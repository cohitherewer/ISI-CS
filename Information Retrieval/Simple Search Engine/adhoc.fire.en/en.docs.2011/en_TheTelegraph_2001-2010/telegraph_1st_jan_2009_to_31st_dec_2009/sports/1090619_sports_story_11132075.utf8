	Nottingham: Pakistan relied on Shahid Afridis brilliant all-round show to stun favourites South Africa by seven runs in their semi-final in the World Twenty20 Thursday.         
	Afridi first hit a 34-ball 51, his maiden Twenty20 half-century to take Pakistan to 149 for four and then took two key wickets, those of AB de Villiers and Herschelle Gibbs, for 16 to guide his side to their second successive final of the showpiece event.         
	Chasing 150 on a slow Trent Bridge pitch, South Africa choked again at the big stage after a brilliant run in the tournament, managing just 142 for five.         
	Jacques Kallis waged a lone battle with a 54-ball 64 to become the highest run-getter of the tournament.         
	The loss means South Africa miss out on a World Cup final yet again besides snapping their seven-match unbeaten streak in Twenty20 Internationals.         
	South Africa did not have the best of starts to their run chase. Captain Graeme Smith, who was let off by Umar Gul when on 10, fell at the same score in the sixth over with young Mohammed Aamer taking the prized wicket.         
	One-down Gibbs sent an Afridi delivery to the boundary as soon as he came in only to be bowled by him as the Proteas slumped to 46 for two in the seventh over.         
	Two overs later, Afridi cramped in-form de Villiers (1) for space for and the South African dragged the ball onto his stumps.         
	With 52 needed off the last five overs and 39 from the last three, pressure kept on piling and Kallis fell while slogging Saeed Ajmal in the 18th over.         
	Ajmal (1/23) and Aamer (1/30) were the other wicket takers for Pakistan.           (PTI)

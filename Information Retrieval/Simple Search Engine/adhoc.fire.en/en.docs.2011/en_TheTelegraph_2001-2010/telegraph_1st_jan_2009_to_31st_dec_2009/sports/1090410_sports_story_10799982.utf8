	Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar and four of his victorious teammates returned to Mumbai in the wee hours Thursday, thanking every Indian for their support to the team in their quest for victory in New Zealand.         
	Its an achievement. Everyone is happy. The entire country has supported us. It was victory after 41 years, the champion batsman told reporters at the airport.         
	Under Mahendra Singh Dhoni, India defeated New Zealand in their own backyard in a Test series for the first time since Mansur Ali Khan Pataudis team vanquished the Kiwis in 1967-68.         
	Tendulkar, who had made vital contributions with the bat in the five-match ODI series and the Test rubber, returned with Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh, Munaf Patel and Dhawal Kulkarni.         
	Some members of the support staff also landed in Mumbai with them. Captain Dhoni and some other members of the team disembarked in Delhi.         
	South-based cricketers, including stalwarts Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman, went to their respective places directly, according to the Board of Control for Cricket in India sources.         
	Dhoni, Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, Ishant Sharma and Amit Mishra received a heroes welcome on arrival at the Indira Gandhi International Airport. Innumerable supporters gathered to get a glance of the players.         
	Sehwag was accompanied by wife Aarti, while Ishants father Vijay Sharma came to the airport to receive the pacer.         
	The cricketers did not speak to the waiting reporters as they were whisked away by the security men.         
	India clinched the three-Test series 1-0 after the third Test ended in a draw in Wellington on Tuesday.         
	They had won the first Test in Hamilton by 10 wickets while the second one in Napier ended in a draw.         
	India had earlier clinched the five-match one-day series 3-1, also their first series win in the shorter version of the game in New Zealand.           (PTI)

                                                     Ive no plans of moving out, says Saurabh
            A STAFF REPORTER            Saurabh Tiwary                           
	Calcutta: Saurabh Tiwary has no plans of moving out of Jharkhand to pursue his dream of playing for Team India. Tiwary was the highest scorer from the East in Ranji Trophy plate group this season  547 runs in five matches at an average of 60.77 with two centuries.         
	Dhoni has made it big from here (Jharkhand)... He has shown that cricketers from small towns can also reach the pinnacle. Cricketers who rise from these places usually stay at the top level for long, Tiwary told The Telegraph on Saturday.         
	They are not the ones who keep getting in and out of the team. They know the value of performance and retaining their place in the side. They learn the tricks of the trade and how to deal with pressure. They key is to perform, he explained.         
	I know as a Jharkhand player I will get to play fewer matches but if I have it in me, I will make it big from here. Ive played India U-19 from here and am confident will make the senior grade too.         
	The 19-year-old, who wears his hair long a la the previous Dhoni, was part of the World Cup-winning India U-19 side. He also played three matches for the Mumbai Indians last season in the Indian Premier League.         
	Sharing the dressing room with Sachin for the Mumbai Indians was awesome... It was a dream come true, said Saurabh.

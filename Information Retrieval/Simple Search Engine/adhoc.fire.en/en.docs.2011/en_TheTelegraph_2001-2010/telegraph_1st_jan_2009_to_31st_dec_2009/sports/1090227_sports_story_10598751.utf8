            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: South Africa batting great Graeme Pollock said on Thursday it was absolutely fantastic to be inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.         
	The left-hander received his commemorative cap from ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat during the tea interval on Day I of the first South AfricaAustralia Test in Johannesburg.         
	Ive played with some great cricketers going back 10, 20 and 30 years who are on the list and to be part of that is great, Pollock was quoted as saying in a release on Thursday.         
	Its absolutely fantastic to be included in the first 55 as you could quite easily have named 100 and there would be no criticism because there have been so many wonderful players, he added.         
	The other South African in the list, Barry Richards, received his commemorative cap before the ODI between Australia and South Africa at the WACA in Perth in late January.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bopara, Cook make merry
                                                     Bopara, Cook make merry
                  Ravi Bopara                     
	Chester-le-Street: Ravi Bopara scored his third century in three innings as England punished the West Indies bowlers on Thursday to reach 302 for two on the first day of the second Test.         
	Alastair Cook also scored his ninth Test century to share a second-wicket partnership of 213 with Bopara who was bowled for 108 by Lionel Baker. Cook finished the day unbeaten on 126.         
	After Englands 10-wicket triumph at Lords, the opening days batting performance on a cold day at Durhams Riverside ground gave the West Indies little hope of winning the second Test to square the series. Bopara, who scored 104 in Bridgetown and 143 at Lords, joins Herbert Sutcliffe, Dennis Compton, Geoffrey Boycott and Graham Gooch as England players who have scored three centuries in three innings.         
	After winning the toss, England captain Andrew Strauss made 26 before he was given out caught behind off Chris Gayle with 69 runs on the board.         
	Cook and Bopara then continued the leisurely pace of the morning session.           (AP)

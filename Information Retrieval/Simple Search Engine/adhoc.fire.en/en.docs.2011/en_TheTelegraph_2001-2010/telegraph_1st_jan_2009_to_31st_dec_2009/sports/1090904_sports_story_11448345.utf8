                                                   Legal brain to untangle Bhutia mess
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) Thursday appointed former Additional Solicitor General of India, Amarendra Sharan arbitrator in the Bhaichung Bhutia-Mohun Bagan impasse.         
	Sharan is expected to submit his report in one weeks time with the AIFF determined to break the deadlock as soon as possible. We will solve the problem in the coming seven to 10 days, AIFF president in-charge, Praful Patel had said on the eve of the Nehru Cup final.         
	A section of the officials, however, were sceptical whether the appointment of an arbitrator would bring an end to the row which has forced the India captain to stay out of club football in the new season.         
	As per the AIFF law, an arbitrator only comes into the picture after a particular dispute remains unresolved in the Players Status Committee (PSC) and the Appeals Committee, said an official.         
	It is strange that neither the PSC nor the Appeals Committee was taken into consideration and an arbitrator appointed straightaway. Now there is a distinct possibility that, once the arbitrators report is submitted, one of the two parties might go to the court of law, the official said.         
	Bhaichung, considered the face of Indian football, has been pleading for justice for three months now after Bagan slapped a six-month suspension on him for not showing up in club practice sessions on a few occasions.         
	Bhaichung himself caused a twist to the issue when he joined East Bengal saying he was dejected with Bagans behaviour. The AIFF general secretary, Alberto Colaco, who was authorised by the executive committee to try and work out an amicable solution, failed to break the stalemate after holding meetings separately with both Bagan and Bhaichung.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Paranoia seems No.1 cause for misgivings
                                                     Paranoia seems No.1 cause for misgivings
  - ICC special panel meeting on Wada deferred       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI    
	Calcutta: Had there been no postponement, then Saturday would have seen the start of a two-day meeting of the International Cricket Council (ICC) special panel, formed to study concerns and make recommendations specific to the implementation of the contentious whereabouts clause.         
	The meeting, which was to have been held in Dubai, has been put off indefinitely, but the World Anti Doping Agency (Wada) Code and that clause continue to be talked about.         
	All 11 Indian players (two of them women), who are on the ICCs International Registered Testing Pool and are supposed to give their consent to an out-of-competition dope testing procedure, have refused.         
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is backing them. Not that it has a choice, with senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkar heading the Pool list.         
	Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, current ODI and T20 vice-captain Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh, Virender Sehwag, Zaheer Khan, Gautam Gambhir, Irfan Pathan, Munaf Patel, womens captain Jhulan Goswami and Mithali Raj follow Sachin.         
	Those on the list are covered by Wadas Anti-Doping Administration and Management System.         
	While the players stated reasons for not signing the document are chiefly that the whereabouts clause constitutes an invasion of their privacy and exposes them to a security risk, one of the seniors had something else, too, to tell The Telegraph.         
	As per the requirements, weve got to inform the ICC where well be for one hour each day over a three-month period. If we miss three random tests, then we could be banned for between one and two years... Even missing one test, for perfectly genuine reasons, is bound to lead to a furore, the senior pro said over the phone on Saturday.         
	He added: You know how the public reacts... Hungama ho jaye ga Everybody will assume that the player had something to hide and, so, missed the random dope test... Some in the media would also make a mountain out of a molehill... How many would accept that the player must have had very good reasons to be somewhere else in that one-hour period?         
	According to the senior pro, most of the players are rather paranoid over the possibility of the public and a section of the media hounding them for a missed test.         
	More than the invasion of privacy and the security bit, it seems the paranoia over missing a random dope test is the No.1 reason for not wanting to sign on the dotted line.         
	The BCCI, apparently, is aware of this but hasnt spoken about it publicly.         
	Former India captain Anil Kumble, incidentally, is on the ICCs special (five-member) panel.

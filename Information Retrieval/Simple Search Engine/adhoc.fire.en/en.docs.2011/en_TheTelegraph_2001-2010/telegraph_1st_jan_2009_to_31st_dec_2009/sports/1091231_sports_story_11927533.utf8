The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gautam: It wasnt smooth 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Gautam: It wasnt smooth 
                  Gambhir                     
	New Delhi: Gautam Gambhir maybe among the premier batsmen of the world but the ICC Test Player of the Year believes he did not get the kind of backing early in his career which some other players were privileged to.         
	Gambhir made his one-day International (ODI) debut in April 2003 in the TVS Cup in Bangladesh under Sourav Gangulys captaincy but was dumped soon after the tournament and it took him two-and-half years to make a comeback to the ODI squad which had Rahul Dravid as the captain.         
	Looking back, Gambhir said he was not given the kind of backing that some other players were lucky to have.         
	There have been players who were given lot of security and confidence. But early in my career, it never happened with me, Gambhir said. I was dropped and even though I made a comeback, it went deep into my system that I have to score runs to stay (in the team). It wasnt smooth, he said.         
	Gambhir reckons it was this realisation that made him cut down on frills and flair and concentrate on big, rather than just spectacular, innings.         
	When you realise it all boils down to scoring runs, you cut down on a number of shots and flair. It has gone inside your system so badly that you know that if you are not going to score runs, youd be dropped again. Thats how you have been treated in the past. It could be one of the reasons why I lost some flair, Gambhir said.         
	Since his quiet start, Gambhir has come a long way to be the No. 1 Test batsman in the world. Asked if he still stuck to his opinion that he was the least talented player in the side, the Delhi player smiled and said: I said that because at one stage, I felt I dont have the same amount of flair that other people have. Maybe I had it at some point of time but then I lost it.         
	Not that Gambhir is too worried with his lack of flair.         
	Its not about flair but about scoring runs, big runs. Its not about being supremely talented or being super-natural. Its how much you can contribute. People dont want to see you scoring 20-odd quick runs. They want you to score a hundred so that you can win the game for your country, he elaborated.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Indian hockey is once again in the news for the wrong reasons.         
	Three days after Mohammed Aslam Khan quit, amidst controversy, as the Hockey India (HI) secretary, some of the players at the national camp have written to the federation accusing chief coach Jose Brasa of acting in a high-handed manner.         
	The players, sources said, are being led by ace drag-flicker Sandeep Singh, who was recently dropped as the captain by Brasa for the seven-match series against Canada. Brasa, team sources said, Monday underwent an operation for hernia in a Pune hospital. He is fine and should be back with the team very soon, he said.         
	According to a HI official, who did not wish to be named, most of the players, who couldnt find a place in the team for the Champions Challenge tournament, in Argentina next month, are against the Spanish coach.         
	Some of them have written the letter to HI, the official said. These players feel that the coach had dropped them deliberately and was working in an autocratic manner.         
	Although HI president A.K. Mattoo has rushed to Pune to douse the fire, he is unlikely to attach much importance to the players complaints against the coach.         
	It is only a ploy by a section of the players to undermine the coachs importance, the official said. It is unfortunate that some team officials are also involved in it. They are finding it difficult to accept Rajpal Singh as the captain and are trying their best to spoil the show.         
	Brasa was employed by the Sports Authority of India (SAI) after his name was recommended by the International Hockey Federation (FIH).

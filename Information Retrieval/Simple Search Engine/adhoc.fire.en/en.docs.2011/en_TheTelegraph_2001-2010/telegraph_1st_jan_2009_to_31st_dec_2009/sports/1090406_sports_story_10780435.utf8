The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Referee struck by coin
                                                   Referee struck by coin
                      
	Cardiff: A football referee was hit in the head by a coin thrown from the stands Sunday during a second division English game between rival Welsh teams. Mike Dean was cut above his right eye but continued to officiate the League Championship match between Cardiff and Swansea at Ninian Park after being treated. Police arrested a Cardiff supporter.         
	Dean was hit in the 42nd minute, with Swansea leading 1-0. The match finished 2-2.         
	It was an absolutely crazy thing to do, Cardiff manager Dave Jones said. Throwing a coin could have easily taken someones eye out. It could have hit one of our players, one of the Swansea players or the referee. Why do it?         
	Its the last thing we need down here. Weve worked really hard to get away from all that and improve our image, I cant understand the mentality of the person. We have all the banter, the shouting and atmosphere but its just a football match. I thought those days were long gone.         
	Police officers are studying CCTV to identify other fans who appeared to throw missiles onto the field. Five more arrests were made outside the stadium. (AP)

            A STAFF REPORTER                Dhoni, Gambhir                            
	Calcutta: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and opener Gautam Gambhir were each nominated for two categories, while Yuvraj Singh and Virender Sehwag were shortlisted for the ODI Player of the Year category of the International Cricket Council annual awards to be announced on October 1 in Johannesburg.         
	The ICC announced the shortlists for the awards on Tuesday.         
	Gambhir, Dhoni, Australian pacer Mitchell Johnson and Englishman Andrew Strauss have been shortlisted for the Sir Garfield Sobers trophy for Cricketer of the Year after voting by an independent 25-member academy.         
	In addition, Gambhir, Johnson and Strauss were also shortlisted for the Test Player of the Year alongside Sri Lankas Thilan Samaraweera.         
	Dhoni is also in contention to retain the ODI Player of the Year award he won last year as he is shortlisted in that category with teammates Yuvraj and Sehwag as well as West Indies Shivnarine Chanderpaul.         
	Pacer Zaheer Khan, off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, VVS Laxman, Amit Mishra and women teams former captain Mithali Raj, who made the long list of various categories earlier were left out of the final list of nominees.

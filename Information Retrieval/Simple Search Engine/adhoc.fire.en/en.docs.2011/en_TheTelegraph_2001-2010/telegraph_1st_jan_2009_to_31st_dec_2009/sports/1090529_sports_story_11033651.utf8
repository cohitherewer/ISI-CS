The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting is the most marketable
                                                     Ponting is the most marketable

	Melbourne: Australia captain Ricky Ponting has pipped Olympic stars like Stephanie Rice and Ian Thorpe to emerge as the countrys most marketable sportsperson in a survey that has pace legend Glenn McGrath at the fourth spot.         
	However, the never-ending controversies in Andrew Symonds career have led to a massive dip in the troubled all-rounders marketability and he has nosedived from the previous 10th to the 35th spot.         
	The same agency had feted Symonds a couple of years ago for being the quickest ever riser in their top 10 list.         
	Survey analyst Todd Deacon said the survey makes it quite apparent that Australian fans were tired of misbehaving sports stars.         
	Theres no doubt that misbehaving athletes are falling faster and further than they have in previous years, said Deacon. The whole notion of role models in sport is really on the rise, and when athletes dont live up to that, well, they are being discarded quickly, he added.         
	Deacon said the infamous gone fishing episode was a major embarrassment for Symonds as fans began questioning his commitment to the sport.         
	It had people questioning his commitment to the baggy green. I mean, playing for our national cricket team, its seen as a great honour and not something to be taken flippantly, Deacon explained.         
	Meanwhile, Pontings former deputy Adam Gilchrist, who recently led the Deccan Chargers to the IPL title, is tied for the second spot in the survey with retired rugby star Grant Hackett.

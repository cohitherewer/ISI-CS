The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AITA has the last laugh
                                                   AITA has the last laugh
                      
	New Delhi: The next Davis Cup tie between India and Australia will be a home fixture for India, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) ruled on Thursday.         
	The two nations were due to play an Asia/Oceania group I tie in Chennai in May but Australia forfeited when they refused to send a team due to security fears.         
	In a significant development, the ITF board of directors upheld the AITAs appeal against the ITF Davis Cup Committee, which had suggested a draw of lots to decide the venue.         
	The ITF board of directors met in Madrid on Wednesday.         
	The directors considered Indias appeal and declared that Chennai was a safe venue and Australia ought to have gone to Chennai, an AITA media release.         
	The directors reversed the decision of the Davis Cup Committee and gave the right to India to host the next Davis Cup tie with Australia whenever the two nations are drawn to meet each other, it added.         
	An ITF release said: The Board reaffirmed its right to review all or any decisions of the Davis Cup Committee but chose not to review the financial penalties that the committee levied on Australia previously.         
	The AITA had demanded severe punishment for Australia who were let off with just a $10,000 fine.         
	India are due to play South Africa in Johannesburg in September in a World Group playoff and could face Australia again next year if they lose.           (PTI)

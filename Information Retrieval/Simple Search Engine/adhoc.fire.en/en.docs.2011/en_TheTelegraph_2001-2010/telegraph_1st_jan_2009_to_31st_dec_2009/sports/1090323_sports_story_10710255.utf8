            A STAFF REPORTER            Satyajit Bose (right) gets past Selywn Fernandes at the Barasat Stadium on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting completely outplayed Mumbai FC, defeating them 2-0 on Sunday, thereby throwing the relegation fight wide open in the I-League.         
	Air Indias 1-0 victory against Vasco Sports Club at the Cooperage on Sunday has made the fight for survival very interesting. Its a four-way fight between Air India, Mohammedan Sporting, JCT and United SC to avoid relegation, with Vasco surely going down this season.         
	With Sundays win, Mohammedan Sporting have 22 points from 20 matches. They play two tough opponents  Dempo SC and Churchill Brothers  in their remaining two encounters, away from home. Air India have 23 points from 20 matches while JCT are on 21 points from 19 matches. United SC are currently at the 11th spot with 21 points from 18 matches.         
	Mohammedan Sportings performance on Sunday was quite baffling. The free-flowing football they offered at the Barasat stadium simply doesnt justify their position on the I-League table.         
	Its true that both their goals, on either side of the lemon break, were controversial. But the way they dominated the match, stringing one brilliant move after the other, was simply astounding. The first goal came in the 15th minute when Satyajit Bose curled in a corner kick from the right. Mumbai FC goalkeeper Lihaz Koya collected the ball cleanly only to be found by the linesman to have crossed the goalline. The visiting players protested against the decision but only in vain.         
	Mohammedan Sportings second came in the 70th minute when the home team were awarded a penalty for a foul on Satyajit by Selwyn Fernandes. A round of protests followed again, but to no avail. Eugene Gray made no mistake from the spot.         
	Mohammedan Sportings star striker Mike Okoro was at his best on Sunday. His combination with Suraj Mondal upfront gave a tough time to the rival defence, which failed to match the pace of the home teams strikers.         
	Okoros deft touches were a joy to watch. He played down the flanks, regularly swapping positions with Gray and set up Satyajit on numerous occasions. Were it not for the couple of sitters missed by Okoro, the visitors would have gone home completely humiliated.         
	Suraj has been a revelation for the Calcutta club. Scoring has always been a problem for coach Shabbir Alis boys. He is a livewire on the field and has built up a nice understanding with Okoro. Shabbir said as much after the win. Suraj is my third foreigner He was brilliant today, he said. If the black and white brigade finally get relegated, they would have their below-par performance in the first leg to blame.

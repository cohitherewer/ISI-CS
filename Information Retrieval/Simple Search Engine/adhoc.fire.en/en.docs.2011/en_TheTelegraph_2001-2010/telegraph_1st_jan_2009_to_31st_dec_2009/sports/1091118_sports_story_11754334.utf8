The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brazil beat Oman 2-0
                                                                                                                                     Brazil beat Oman 2-0
          
	Muscat: An opportunistic strike from Villareal hitman Nilmar and a Hassan Mudhaffar own goal earned Brazil a 2-0 victory over Oman at the Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex on Tuesday.         
	Nilmars poaching instincts gave Brazil the lead in the fourth minute as he poked the ball home from close range after Blackburn Rovers keeper Ali Al Habsi had made a spectacular save to deny Luis Fabiano.         
	Brazil coach Dunga praised Omans performance. It was a good match. Oman play tactically good football and they were on top of their game. After playing England we were tired and thats why we didnt play to our usual standards, Dunga said.         
	Brazil beat England 1-0 in Doha on Saturday. Oman are improving and if they go the same way they will definitely qualify for the next World Cup, added Dunga, who led Brazil to World Cup glory in the United States in 1994.         
	The five-time world champions dominated proceedings in the first half, and then made a flurry of substitutions at halftime as Dunga sought to rest his top players, with Kaka, Fabiano and Felipe Melo all substituted.         
	Brazil doubled their advantage in the 61st minute courtesy of an own goal from defender Mudhaffar.           (AP)

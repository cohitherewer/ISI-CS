The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Happy being of help: Sachin 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Happy being of help: Sachin 
  - Maestro to be star attraction at the Vaani fund-raiser       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              Sachin Tendulkar      
	Calcutta: Around 10 days ago, Sachin Tendulkar was promoting Aamir Khans 3 Idiots. Come Tuesday and international crickets senior-most pro will be lending his name, here, to a cause with a difference.         
	In between, of course, Sachin has found time to make life miserable for Kumar Sangakkara and Co. The maestro was particularly clinical in Cuttack, on Monday, remaining not out on 96.         
	But while theres no charity from Sachin on the field, its quite different away from the heat of the 22 yards. Just as well, or a number of good causes would probably have been much the poorer.         
	I may not have talked about it, but Ive done a few things for deaf children... Im happy that another opportunity has come up, this time in Calcutta, Sachin told The Telegraph from Bhubaneswar.         
	Sachin, clearly, will be the star attraction at the fund-raiser being organised by Vaani, Deaf Childrens Foundation, at Taj Bengal.         
	With itineraries so tight, its not always possible to find time for charity work and fund-raisers... However, if something can be squeezed in, then Im game for charity... I do try and help those whore in need of something, Sachin, in his 21st year as an India cricketer, added.         
	An online auction of cricket memorabilia, thanks to mjunction services limited, is going to be a feature of the fund-raiser.         
	Earlier this year, it may be recalled, Sachin had been the face of The Joy of Giving Week campaign and volunteered to conduct a days coaching clinic, which went under the hammer.         
	The auction was done online and fetched Rs 12 lakh. Actually, the two highest bids were for the same amount (Rs 6 lakh each) and the bidders agreed to share time with Sachin.         
	Apnalaya, a Mumbai-based NGO Sachin has been associated with for a number of years, is the designated beneficiary of the amount raised in that auction.         
	Incidentally, on the eve of The Week (September 27-October 3), Sachin had made an appeal through these columns: Please donate with lots of joy... Contribute whatever you can from the bottom of your heart, nothing would be too little.         
	As for the day-long coaching clinic, it will have to be conducted in the new year.         
	The date when Ill be coaching hasnt been finalised... As you know, weve been playing non-stop, almost, from September... It has to be in 2010 and the availability of those who topped the auction will also have to be taken into account, Sachin pointed out.         
	For the successful bidders, the wait would surely be worth it.

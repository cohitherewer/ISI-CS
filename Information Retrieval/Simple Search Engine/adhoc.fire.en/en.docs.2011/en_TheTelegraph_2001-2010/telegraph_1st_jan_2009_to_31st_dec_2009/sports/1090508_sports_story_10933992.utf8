The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pakistan are well-placed
                                                   Pakistan are well-placed
                      
	Dubai: Umar Gul and Shahid Afridis impressive spell with the ball helped Pakistan restrict Australia to a meagre 108 in a Twenty20 match on Thursday.               
	At the end of 14 overs, Pakistan were 92/2. Misbah-ul Haq and Kamran Akmal were at the crease               
	Gul, who took a wicket with his first ball, returned with figures of 4-0-8-4, which was just one run more than the best-ever figures in Twenty20 internationals. Afridi scalped three for 14 in his quota of four overs.         
	Shane Watson provided the Australians with a flying start, smashing 33 off 14 balls. But once Watson fell in the fourth over, the Aussies tumbled like a house of cards.         
	Watson seemed to be carrying off from his century in the final one-dayer.           (AGENCIES)

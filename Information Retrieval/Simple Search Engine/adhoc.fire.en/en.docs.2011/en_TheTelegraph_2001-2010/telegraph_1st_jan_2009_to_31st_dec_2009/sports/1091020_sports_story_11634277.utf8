The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I am delighted, says captain 
                                                   I am delighted, says captain 
                      
	Karachi: Younis Khan is delighted after being given the reigns of the Pakistan team yet again, but says the overwhelming support he got is bound to put more pressure on him to perform as a leader.         
	Obviously I am very happy and delighted that the Board has shown so much confidence in me and given me respect. The amount of support I have got from the people and media is amazing. It just adds that much more pressure on me to do better as captain, Younis said, reacting to PCBs decision.         
	The senior batsman said that one thing he had learnt from the time he resigned as captain last week was that the Pakistani people were very passionate about their cricket.         
	Younis said he had always taken pride in playing for Pakistan and leading them was a bigger honour.         
	Since being made captain this year I have given my best for my country. But now I will have work harder and deliver more results than the last eight months as captain, he added.         
	Younis said he would work towards uniting the team and get more positive results from the team in coming events.         
	I am really honored by the respect and confidence the Board has shown in me. It was a difficult decision for me to submit my resignation last week after what happened in the wake of our defeat to New Zealand in the Champions Trophy.         
	But I felt hurt and I did what I considered was right. But the board has shown confidence in me once again and I am happy to be captain again, he said.         
	Younis said the Pakistan team had a lot of potential and could give better performances than it has given this season so far. It is going to be a challenge not only for me but for all the players to live up to the peoples expectations.         
	Younis said he would meet with the PCB chairman Ejaz Butt and selectors soon to chalk out plans for the future and one-day series against New Zealand. (PTI)

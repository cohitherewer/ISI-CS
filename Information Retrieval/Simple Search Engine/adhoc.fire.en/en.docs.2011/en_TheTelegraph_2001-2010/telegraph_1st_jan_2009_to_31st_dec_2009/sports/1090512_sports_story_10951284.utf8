The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Beto boost for EB
                                                   Beto boost for EB
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Dempo Sports Clubs Brazilian midfielder Beto is all set to join East Bengal for the coming season. The Brazilian, who last played in Calcutta for Mohun Bagan some four seasons back, will be signing the deal only after Dempos last AFC Cup group match, against Al Faisaly scheduled to be held in Goa on May 19.         
	Betos signing would be a fillip to East Bengal since they failed to rope in any of the big names they had targeted.         
	Beto, in fact, is walking out of his two-year deal with Dempo on the basis of a Fifa rule, which says if a footballer is more than 28 years old and has played for a club for more than two years, he can leave without completing the last year of his contract.         
	Its a strange feeling for me. Leaving Dempo after a great four-year stint. But I have no choice. East Bengals philosophy and their coach (Subhas Bhowmick) appeal to me, Beto said from Goa.         
	Beto made it clear that he was not a mercenary. I am not leaving Dempo for money. East Bengal were not offering me anything huge. Its just that I want to play for them.         
	Betos last stint in Calcutta was disastrous as he found himself uncomfortable playing as a forward for Bagan. But ever since he moved to Dempo, the Brazilian blossomed under coach Armando Colaco who started playing him in the midfield. Whether he can forge a telling partnership with Yusif Yakubu for East Bengal in the coming season remains to be seen.

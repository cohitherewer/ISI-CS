	Mohali: With cold wave conditions prevailing in the region and the dew factor in the night, batting under lights wont be an easy job when India take on Sri Lanka in the second Twenty-20 International in the two-match series at the Punjab Cricket Association grounds here on Saturday.         
	Batting under flood lights wont be easy. The scenario will be different from the IPL T20 matches which were played here in the summer months of April-May last year, chairman of the Board of Control for Cricket India (BCCI)s grounds and pitches committee and the PCAs chief curator, Daljit Singh said here Thursday.         
	India would be eyeing a win here after their 29-run loss in the opening match in Nagpur Wednesday.         
	He said that after the sunset, which is around 5:20pm these days, conditions can change fast here and after 7pm, lots of dew can be expected, particularly if there is a clear sky.

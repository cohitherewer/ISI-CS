The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | EB loss is Pune FC gain
                                                   EB loss is Pune FC gain
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Contrary to belief, Subrata Paul was not even offered a new contract by East Bengal, leave alone being asked to play after taking a pay-cut.         
	Sources in East Bengal said a section of the officials were hell bent on getting rid of the India goalkeeper and thats why he was given the boot.         
	So, are they now regretting the move? Not really. Look even the coach (Subhas Bhowmick) did not want too many national players in the team. We just followed his orders.         
	And, also, when you are hiring a star player you need to think about the team composition.         
	In everything, Bhowmick had the final say, the source said on Tuesday.         
	And, East Bengals loss was Pune FCs gain. The newly-promoted I-League club, who roped in Paul, are already thinking big.         
	We never doubted Subratas class. We took into account his performances for the national team over the last three years.         
	Loss of form is temporary. We always knew he would be a good buy.         
	Our coach Derek Pereira was instrumental in getting him on board, PFC head of operations Chirag Tanna said.         
	There is speculation that Subratas mentor, Debasish Mukherjee may be appointed as the goalkeeping coach at the club.         
	Mukherjee said that its still early days but admitted talks were on so that he could visit Subrata in Pune whenever the goalkeeper needed help.         
	At present, Norbert Gonsalves, the clubs under-19 goalkeeping coach is accompanying the squad for the ongoing IFA Shield.         
	Right now we have no plans of hiring a goalkeeping coach. We will take a call when the I-League begins, Tanna kept the guessing game on.         
	Paul is getting into club mode on Wednesday.

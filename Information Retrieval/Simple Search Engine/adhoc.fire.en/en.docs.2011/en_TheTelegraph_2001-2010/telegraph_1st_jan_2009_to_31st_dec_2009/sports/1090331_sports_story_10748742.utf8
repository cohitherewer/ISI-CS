The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Panel to seek other versions
                                                   Panel to seek other versions
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) cricket committee will speak to a couple of other players before arriving at a decision in the Ranadeb Bose-Ashok Dinda spat during the Vijay Hazare Trophy in Agartala earlier this month.         
	Committee members Samar Kar, Subroto Porel, Alok Bhattacharjee and Shibaji Roy spoke to both the players along with manager Debabrata Das Monday. The players version did not tally with the managers report and that prompted the committee to seek other versions.         
	Since the incident happened outside Calcutta, we need to speak to others The meeting has been adjourned We dont want to do anything that will be detrimental to the careers of both players, said joint secretary Arun Mitra.         
	It was learnt that Sourav Sarkar, Debabrata Das and Wriddhiman Saha were present when the incident happened on the eve of their semi-final.         
	While Ranadeb stood by what he had said and urged the committee to speak to other players, Dinda denied any wrongdoing. Nothing like this happened, he is learnt to have told the committee.         
	Dinda will leave for Mumbai Tuesday en route to South Africa to play in the IPL, but Mitra said that wouldnt be a problem. The committee will decide after the IPL if needed, he said. Mitra also said that the decision can be carried over to the next season if the local season gets over by then.

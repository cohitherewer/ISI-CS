                                                   Barrichello recipe for success in Japan
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Rubens Barrichello has a simple recipe for success in this weekends Japanese Grand Prix and the drivers world championship  win or bust.         
	The veteran Brazilian trails his Brawn GP teammate Briton Jenson Button by 15 points in the title race with three races remaining.         
	For me, its pretty simple. Its winning, winning, winning, basically, he said. Its pretty simple. People have said if I change my tactics and go flat-out thats all I need to do, but Ive been flat-out a long time.         
	Thats all there is for me to try  to win the race without getting worried about where Jenson is. After the race, we get to see if I did conquer more or less points.         
	Barrichello said he was not concerned too much by the prospects of rain, and was more worried about the threat from the Red Bull team of Sebastien Vettel and Mark Webber.         
	We always knew that coming to Suzuka it was always a track that very much favoured the Red Bulls, so we have that in mind. It has been a little bit more humid than normal for Suzuka, he said.         
	So if its a little bit hotter, that will help our tyre situation. Having said that, I love the track, and I will give my very best.         
	Asked about his friend Fernando Alonsos move to Ferrari from Renault next year, he said: I think its a case of love.         
	Theres been talk of Fernando going to Ferrari for the past two years and there were times he was certain that he would go and other times when it wasnt so certain that he would go.         
	It was a surprise that it was announced so early because they had contracts with Kimi (Raikkonen), so I dont know the arrangement there.         
	Fernando going there? He was wishing for this so badly. Ferrari were as well. Hes Latin, its going to easily gel and its going to be good. Fernando is a top-class driver  for me, hes on the level of a Michael Schumacher.         
	He can really be on the top, and I (hope) my friend Felipe Massa can hold onto him, as Fernando is going to be the man to be beaten.         
	As to his own future, Barrichello said: Its fairly open, from a positive side.         
	Im in a much better shape than Ive ever been in, winning races and being on the top of the paddocks mouth have opened up my chances a lot.         
	I wish to be driving next year a competitive car and I think Ill be driving a competitive car. So far, thats all I can say for the time being. Its not done.         
	I had two hours on the shinkansen (bullet train) coming here today with Ross Brawn, and we talked about Singapore and everything else.         
	My chances of being in F1 next year  99.9 percent, I would say.         
	Last year, I knew I had the speed in myself, but we were not driving a competitive car. Youre only as good as your last race  thats the way I look at Formula One.

	Napier: New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori does not regret the decision of enforcing follow-on even though it didnt pay off in the end with India forcing a draw in the second cricket Test here.         
	He defended his decision, which saw the New Zealand bowlers operate for six long sessions spread over three days without much success, and said that he wanted to maintain the pressure on the Indian batsmen after bowling them out for 305 in the first innings.         
	The situation was that we had rolled them pretty quickly and had 17 overs to put them under a lot of pressure and I wanted to have a go, Vettori said.         
	We got the crucial wicket of (Virender) Sehwag but from then on India batted resolutely throughout the whole next two days. I have no regrets with the decision (to enforce follow-on), the Black Caps captain said.         
	Looking back, Vettori felt the result could have gone in his teams favour had they been able to take a couple of early Indian wickets on Monday.         
	We needed a couple of early wickets. I suppose when we got (Gautam) Gambhir and the third new ball came along, there was another opportunity. But Yuvraj (Singh) and (V.V.S.) Laxman saw India through that period and once it was gone it was probably out of our reach, Vettori explained.         
	Asked if he would consider the second Test as a missed opportunity to level the three-match series which India lead 1-0, Vettori said, Its hard to say. The amount of pressure that we put India under was fantastic. The wicket was too good in the second innings and India decided to bat a lot more conservatively than they did in the first innings.         
	Vettori felt it still was a good performance by the Black Caps.         
	We were dominant throughout the Test match. The ability to score those big runs should never be underestimated. And the performances of Jesse Ryder, Ross Taylor and Brendon McCullum with the bat was backed up by a magnificent first innings bowling spell by guys like Chris Martin and Jeetan Patel. I was really pleased with that.         
	Couldnt quite get the early wickets in the second innings and that was the only unfortunate thing for us about the Test match, he added.         
	After the performance in Hamilton it was very pleasing to bounce back the way we did. Obviously disappointed not to get the win, not to be able to force the issue on the final day, Vettori said.         
	Vettori also lavished praise on Gambhir for batting nearly 11 hours to lead Indias resurgence with a stellar century. (PTI)

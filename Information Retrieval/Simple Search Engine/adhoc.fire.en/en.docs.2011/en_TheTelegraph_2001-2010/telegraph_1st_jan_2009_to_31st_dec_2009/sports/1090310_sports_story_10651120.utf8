                                                   SA need 302 on final day 
                      
	Durban: Jacques Kallis and A.B. de Villiers put on an unbroken stand of 164 to guide South Africa to 244 for two at stumps Monday on the fourth day of the second Test against Australia.         
	Kallis prospered after being dropped first ball to reach 84 and De Villiers scored 68 at Kingsmead, with the hosts requiring 302 more runs for an improbable victory to square the three-match series at 1-1.         
	The Proteas were set 546 to win after Australia added 39 runs for the loss of two wickets before declaring early Monday on 331 for five.         
	Kallis and De Villiers occupied the crease for 225 minutes, soaking up a lot of pressure as the Australians strove for a breakthrough. There was hardly anything loose from the visitors attack, but once the ball got older there was little sign of the venom from their pacemen which skittled South Africa for 138 in their first innings.         
	With his excellent technique, Kallis can be difficult to remove. He struck 11 fours in 161 balls, while De Villiers hit seven boundaries in 166 balls in a similarly stout effort.         
	Australia turned to spin in the last few overs of the day with fielders crowded around the bat, but the South African pair survived despite a few troubling deliveries from left-arm wrist spinner Simon Katich.         
	A key moment will be when Australia take the second new ball early Tuesday. For South Africa, having two quality batsmen at the crease to take the shine off the new ball will be important.         
	Hashim Amla, pressed into the role of opener because of injury to captain Graeme Smith, said it would not be easy on Tuesday.         
	In the middle session, South Africa lost openers Neil McKenzie on 31 and Amla on 43. Both openers were dismissed for ducks in the first innings, but Amla in particular looked a lot more assured second time around, driving seamer Andrew McDonald for three fours in the last over before lunch.         
	South Africa could have been in more trouble as Kallis was dropped first ball at first slip by Marcus North off Siddle. (AP)

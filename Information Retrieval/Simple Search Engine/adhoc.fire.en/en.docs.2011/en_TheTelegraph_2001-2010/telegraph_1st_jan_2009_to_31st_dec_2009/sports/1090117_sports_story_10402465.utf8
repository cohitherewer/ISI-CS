                                                     Can hit anybody at will: Sehwag
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi: Virender Sehwag threw a challenge at the bowlers on Friday, saying he was capable of hitting all of them out of the ground at will.         
	Speaking at the Cricinfo awards ceremony, where he got the jury award for the best Test batting performance of the year, the dashing opener said: There are only two bowlers  (Glenn) McGrath and Muttiah (Muralidharan)  with whom I cannot take this liberty. I found them to be the most difficult bowlers. As far as the rest of the bowlers are concerned, I can hit them for a boundary whenever I want to.         
	I didnt get much of a chance to play against McGrath except in one series which we lost, Sehwag said. I did hit a hundred in Chennai but realised the Australian was a different kind of bowler.         
	Sehwag said he also held Muralidharan in high esteem and admitted that he could never read the doosra from the Sri Lankan spinner. Asked how he could still hit Muralitharan against the spin for boundaries during his epic innings of 201 last year in Galle, Sehwag laughed and said he was all along expecting the doosra from the champion bowler.         
	I thought he was trying his doosra. So I was hitting him through covers for fours. Later I realised he was only bowling off spin, Sehwag said.         
	The Delhi batsman said he was not bothered about the reputation of the bowlers.         
	No matter who is the bowler, I always like to attack. I dont like to defend and hate to leave deliveries. That is nothing but waste of time. I like to pick them up early and hit through the cover and point region. Frankly, I cannot stop. When I was approaching my 300 in Pakistan, it was Rahul Dravid who asked me to be patient. In Melbourne, when I was out for 195, someone asked me how I felt for missing the double century. Frankly, I wasnt too sad. I was happy with whatever I got, he said.         
	Sehwag, who received the award for his unbeaten 201 against Sri Lanka last year, said it was the best innings of his career.         
	I rate this innings as my best, even better than my two triple hundreds, he remarked. When I scored triple centuries, the wickets were good and the rivals were not attacking at their best. But in Sri Lanka, the wickets were falling regularly. Still I could carry my bat through and set a record. After all, I am not Sunil Gavaskar, who could stay at the wicket for long periods.

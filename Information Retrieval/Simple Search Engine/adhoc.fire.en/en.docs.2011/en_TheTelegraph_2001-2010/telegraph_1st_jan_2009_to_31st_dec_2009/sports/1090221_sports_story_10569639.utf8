The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No fines, but still eventful
                                                   No fines, but still eventful
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: There was no repeat of the 2002 fiasco, when Sourav Ganguly and Harbhajan Singh were fined on landing in New Zealand, but the absence of porters at the Auckland airport didnt amuse Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his tired men on Friday.         
	Tired because it took around 27 hours to reach Christchurch, via Hong Kong and Auckland, from Mumbai.         
	Sourav (the captain then) and Harbhajan had each been fined $200 for incorrectly declaring they were carrying three pairs of used cricket footwear, instead of four, and allowing traces of grass to remain on some.         
	This time, leaving nothing to chance, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) specifically directed the players to (a) clean all footwear thoroughly and (b) carry them in transparent bags.         
	What happened on the last tour was embarrassing, which is why the players were asked to be doubly careful on this trip Everything was listed in the dos and donts, the BCCIs chief administrative officer, Ratnakar Shetty, told The Telegraph.         
	So, while the ministry of agriculture, which slapped the fines in 2002, didnt come into the picture again, the absence of porters made for an eventful landing of sorts.         
	Actually, the Boards in the subcontinent are to be blamed for going overboard with hospitality. To cite an example, its not uncommon for the local manager to arrange a platoon of porters, at the airport, for a visiting team.         
	Its much the same in the hotels.         
	Such hospitality is, of course, not seen anywhere outside the region as strict reciprocity just isnt the name of the game.         
	Only occasionally, the driver and the helper assigned to the team bus take some of the load off the shoulders of a Sachin Tendulkar. Not that theyre obliged to.         
	Look, as is the convention, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed with New Zealand Cricket, but MoUs dont list the number of porters or baggage handlers who should be present at airports There must have been a local problem today Generally, every Board does ensure that the visiting team doesnt face problems, Shetty said.         
	One question doing the rounds, though, is: What was the role played by the teams travel assistant (Mumbais Mayank Parekh) in Auckland?         
	Hed been on the recent tour of Sri Lanka too but, then, things are so different outside the subcontinent.         
	Perhaps, like Dhoni and Co., Parekh wasnt prepared for a bit of exercise after plenty of travelling.         
	Teams from the region face other problems as well.         
	Indeed, in countries like Australia and South Africa, its rare for quality bowlers to be offered at nets. Often, thats part of the hosts strategy!         
	Worse, even the most pedestrian of bowlers dont turn up around Christmas and the New Year.         
	That, however, isnt a worry for teams touring the subcontinent: Dozens of promising bowlers have no qualms over sweating it out.         
	Hospitality, again.

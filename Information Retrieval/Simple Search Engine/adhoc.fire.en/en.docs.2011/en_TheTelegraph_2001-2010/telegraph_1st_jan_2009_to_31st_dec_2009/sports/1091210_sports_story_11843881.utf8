The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods vanishes from US television

  -  Energy drinks giant cancels contract         THE TIMES, LONDON AGENCIES            Tiger Woods                                 
	Miami: Adverts featuring Tiger Woods have vanished from American prime-time broadcast and cable television amid blanket coverage of lurid claims of his infidelity.         
	According to US media research company Nielsen, the last prime-time advert featuring the 33-year-old golfer was a 30-second Gillette spot on November 29  two days after he crashed his car following a row with his wife.         
	His disappearance from the airwaves was compounded by energy drinks giant Gatorade cancelling a contract with him as the financial ramifications of the scandal that has enveloped Woods started to emerge.         
	The world No. 1 golfer signed a five-year deal with Gatorade in 2007 for an estimated $100 million, which means he stands to lose around $40m.         
	The company, owned by PepsiCo, will cease production of Gatorade Tiger Focus drink, but said that the decision to discontinue the product was made months ago.         
	In a statement it said: We decided several months ago to discontinue Gatorade Tiger Focus along with some other products to make room for our planned series of innovative products in 2010.         
	Woods, who, according to a business magazine, became the worlds first dollar billionaire (617m) sportsperson in October and fourth-highest paid celebrity in 2009, gets an estimated 90 per cent of his income from endorsements.         
	His biggest sponsor, Nike, last week issued a statement saying their agreement with the sports star was unchanged, but the number of his alleged mistresses has since soared into the double digits.         
	The financial blows came after documents were released by the Orange-Osceola state attorneys office in Orlando. They revealed that Woods was investigated for driving while unfit after his wife told a Florida state trooper he had been drinking before his car crash and had been prescribed addictive drugs.         
	State troopers suspected the golfer of being impaired when he took his Cadillac Escalade on a brief but wild ride that ended when he hit a fire hydrant and a tree.         
	Despite being told that Woods had consumed alcohol earlier in the day and that he had been prescribed the sleeping drug Ambien and the painkiller Vicodin, both of which can compromise the ability to think and react, a request by the Florida Highway Patrol to obtain his blood test results from a hospital was refused by the state attorney.         
	Insufficient information provided to lawfully issue subpoena, the written request was marked on November 30, by Steve Foster, the assistant state attorney.         
	According to a celebrity website, hospital sources had said that Woods was admitted to hospital as an overdose case and that doctors had inserted a tube into his trachea to help him to breathe.         
	The saga continued on Monday when his mother-in-law, Barbro Holmberg, collapsed with stomach pains and was taken to Health Central Hospital in nearby Ocoee, days after flying in from Sweden to support her daughter, Elin Nordegren, 29. She was discharged 11 hours later and returned to the Woods family home.         
	Woods has not been seen publicly since his accident.         
	Meanwhile, a Canadian doctor who used a pioneering blood-spinning technique to help Woods recover from his knee surgery will be questioned in court after being charged with three counts of illegally importing and selling drugs.         
	Dr Tony Galea, one of Canadas most prominent sports injury experts whose clients have included Olympic gold medallists Donovan Bailey and Mark McCoy as well as several National Football League (NFL) and National Hockey League (NHL) stars, was arrested and charged following a raid on his offices by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in October.         
	Although there is no suggestion that Woods was given Actovegin or any other unapproved or banned drug, he did avail himself of Galeas cutting-edge injury-healing procedure called platelet-rich plasma therapy, popularly known as blood-spinning.         
	The technique involves taking blood from the patient and spinning it in a centrifuge to increase the concentration of red platelets before re-injecting into the patients injured ligament, tendon or muscle to speed the rate of healing.         
	The procedure is legal under Wada rules although in 2010 it will be allowed only for injections into ligaments and tendons, not muscles.

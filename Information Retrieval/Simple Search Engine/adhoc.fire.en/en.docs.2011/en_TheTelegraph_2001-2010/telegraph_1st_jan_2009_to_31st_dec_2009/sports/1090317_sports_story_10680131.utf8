                                                     India, Pak get the Lara vote
            A STAFF REPORTER            Brian Lara                           
	Calcutta: Brian Lara has predicted either India or Pakistan, because of their batting depth and ability to innovate, will lift the ICC World Twenty20 title in England.         
	The former West Indies captain displayed the trophy to a packed house at the Queens Park Oval in Port of Spain during the interval of the Twenty20 International against England.         
	He admitted it was tough to pick a side that would emerge winners on June 21 at Lords. In 2007 I supported the West Indies (to win) due to the fact that, as a team, we may have been short in Test cricket but very good over a shorter game and Twenty20 was a version of the game.         
	With players like Chris Gayle, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Dwayne Bravo, I thought we would love... But then Bangladesh came and beat us and we didnt win a match so that shows how difficult it is to predict.         
	A team like India or Pakistan, accustomed to good batting tracks, flat tracks and capable of being very innovative could be the ones to walk away with the trophy, said Lara, according to a release.         
	Lara said he still loved Test cricket above all the other formats of the game but felt there was an obvious place for the Twenty20 version.         
	Im still a connoisseur of Test cricket as the true test of any sportsman. But I think Twenty20 cricket is a great invention, especially for the spectator. Its a great addition to the game and I look forward to seeing the ICC World Twenty20, said the elegant left-hander.         
	Lara also reflected on what it was like to lift silverware at an ICC event, having done that in the 2004 Champions Trophy when the West Indies produced a remarkable come-from-behind success in the final against England at The Oval. It was a great feeling and this from a captain not accustomed to winning anything, he said. Wed just lost four Tests against England and then came back from deep trouble in the final when we were seven or eight wickets down late on.         
	Courtney Browne and Ian Bradshaw were able to pull it off for us and that was an excellent feeling.         
	Ive never done it (lifted the trophy) in a World Cup but to play against all the other international countries in one tournament and win was a great feeling and definitely one of the greatest moments of my career, he added.         
	The ICC World Twenty20 will feature 12 of the top mens teams and the top eight womens teams competing in a best-of-the-best event at four venues  Lords, The Oval, Trent Bridge and Taunton (womens matches only).         
	India won the inaugural World Twenty20 in 2007 in South Africa beating Pakistan by five runs in the final in Johannesburg.

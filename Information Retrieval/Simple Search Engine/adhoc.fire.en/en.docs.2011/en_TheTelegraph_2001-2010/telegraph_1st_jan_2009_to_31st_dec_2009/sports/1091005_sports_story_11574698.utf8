The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bowlers not to be blamed: Mishra
                                                     Bowlers not to be blamed: Mishra
                  Amit Mishra                     
	New Delhi: Indian leg spinner Amit Mishra on Sunday rejected skipper Mahendra Singh Dhonis criticism of the teams bowling in the Champions Trophy, saying the bowlers did not make any mistake and credit should be given to rival batsmen.         
	Thats his (Dhoni) personal opinion, Mishra told reporters here.         
	Even though the Indian bowlers cut a sorry figure against Pakistan and even in the washed out match against Australia, Mishra felt credit should go to the rival batsmen.         
	Bowling to the likes of Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey is not an easy task. I dont think our bowlers committed any mistakes. We should give credit to opposition batsmen for playing so well, he said.         
	India were knocked out of the Champions Trophy in the group stage itself after a loss to Pakistan, an abandoned match against Australia and a consolation win over the West Indies and Dhoni had blamed it on poor bowling and fielding.         
	Looking back at Indias listless campaign, Mishra said the format of the tournament was also to be blamed for Indias early exit.         
	This tournament did not have scope for a team to make a comeback. We lost to Pakistan and the wash-out against Australia all but ended our hopes. I hope the ICC takes note of this while conducting future tournaments, he said.         
	Asked about his game, Mishra said he was developing carrom ball delivery of his own, with inputs from Sri Lankan mystery spinner Ajantha Mendis, who has mastered it.         
	I am working on developing a carrom ball. I have been observing Mendis, who has invented this delivery. I also spoke to him on it during the tri-series in Sri Lanka last month. Narendra Hirwani has been helping me improve my bowling for the past three-four years. I am also taking Anil Kumbles help to improve my top spin and add variations to my googly. I am also working out two different types of flippers, he said.         
	Besides, Mishra said he was also working hard to improve his batting.         
	Dhoni has advised me to concentrate a bit more on my batting and I am working hard at the nest to become a reliable number eight or nine batsman, he said.         
	On the upcoming one-day series against Australia later this month, Mishra said India would bank on home advantage to get better of the world champions.         
	We will benefit from the home conditions and if we execute our plans well, then we might even win by a big margin, he said.         
	Mishra stressed on the need to have more Test matches. You ask any cricketer, his first preference would be Test cricket. Thats why I dont think there is any threat to this format. But we should play more Test matches which is not happening right now, he said.

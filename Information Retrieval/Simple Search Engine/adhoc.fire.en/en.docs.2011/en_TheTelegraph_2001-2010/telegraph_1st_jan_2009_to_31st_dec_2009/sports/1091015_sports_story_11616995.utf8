	London: Czech tennis player Ivo Minar was suspended for eight months on Wednesday after testing positive for a banned substance following a Davis Cup match.         
	The International Tennis Federation said the sample, which was taken after the Davis Cup quarterfinal against Argentine on July 11, contained the banned stimulant methylhexanamine. The substance was in a food supplement.         
	Minar told the ITF he took the product following professional advice, without knowing it contained a prohibited substance.(AP)

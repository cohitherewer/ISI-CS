	Kingston: West Indies great Michael Holding doubts if Chris Gayles team can intimidate India with its short-pitched deliveries in the absence of an injured Fidel Edwards, who successfully did the job in the World T20 in England.         
	Edwards is nursing a lower back injury, which he sustained in England, and has been left out of the 13-man squad for the first two one-dayers here.         
	Everyone realises that Fidel is the quickest. He can intimidate and will be crucial to use bouncers as a strategy, Holding said.         
	Without him, though, it will be tough to use that kind of short-pitched bowling, he was quoted as saying by a website.         
	Jerome Taylor has not been all that fit in recent times. Since the first Test against England in Jamaica, he has not been 100 per cent, he added.         
	Indians, who had a cakewalk against minnows Bangladesh and Ireland, fell prey to the short balls bowled by the West Indies in the World T20 Super Eight match.         
	Holding also said he did not expect promising youngsters Lendl Simmons and Darren Sammy to be dropped for the first two matches against India.         
	There arent too many bowlers in the Caribbean to say that they should be in the team. But I have been surprised by the exclusion of Lendl and Darren. They are two young promising cricketers who I thought could be given more opportunities, Holding said.         
	Lendl didnt have a bad tour of England. He is a young cricketer and should be encouraged and nurtured.         
	I cant see any reason why he has been left out especially when I see there are players in the team who didnt play a game in England and have been in the squad for quite some time.         
	ODIs are not something you can predict easily. West Indies have been doing well in the shorter format and I hope they do well against India, he said.

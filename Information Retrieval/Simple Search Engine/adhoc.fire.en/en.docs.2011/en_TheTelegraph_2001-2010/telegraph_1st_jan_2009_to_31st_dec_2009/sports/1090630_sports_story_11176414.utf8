	London: Roger Federer advanced to the quarter finals on a day Wimbledon went indoors. The five-time champion hit 23 aces, never lost serve and beat familiar foe Robin Soderling 6-4, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-5) on Monday.         
	Some 90 minutes after Federer was off Centre Court, rain halted play with Amelie Mauresmo leading top-ranked Dinara Safina, 6-4, 1-4. Officials ordered the new retractable roof closed for the remainder of the match  the first time it has been used during play in the tournament. Safina rallied to win, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.         
	Federer improved to 11-0 against Soderling, including a victory in the French Open final to complete a career Grand Slam three weeks ago.         
	This time the No. 2-seeded Federer came through on a handful of key points. He earned the only service break of the match in the ninth game of the opening set, when Soderling committed five unforced errors to fall behind for good, 5-4.         
	Soderling led in the final tie-breaker but double-faulted on the next-to-last point, then hit an errant return.         
	It was hard to get through, a really dangerous match, Federer said. Not many rallies, so maybe not as much fun for the people. But I stayed calm, waited for my chance.         
	With all 16 fourth-round matches scheduled, the Williams sisters remained on course to play an all-family final for the second year in a row.         
	Five-time champion Venus led 6-1, 0-1 when Ana Ivanovic retired with a left thigh injury. Two-time champion Serena beat Daniela Hantuchova 6-3, 6-1. Venus beat Serena in last years final.         
	American 17-year-old Melanie Oudins surprising run ended when she lost to No. 11-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska, 6-4, 7-5.         
	In mens play, No. 4 Novak Djokovic broke serve seven times and beat Dudi Sela 6-2, 6-4, 6-1. No. 22 Ivo Karlovic hit 35 aces and beat No. 7 Fernando Verdasco 7-6 (7-5), 6-7 (4-7), 6-3, 7-6 (11-9). The 6-foot-10 Karlovic, who has yet to lose his serve in four matches, will face Federer on Wednesday.         
	Unseeded Lleyton Hewitt, the 2002 champion, rallied from a two-set deficit for the sixth time in his career to beat No. 23 Radek Stepanek 4-6, 2-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2.         
	Soderling had just two break-point chances against Federer  both at 4-4 in the third set  and failed to put either return in play. Federer lost only eight points on his first serve and committed just eight unforced errors in the match.         
	Federer needs three more victories this week for his 15th major title, which would break the record he shares with Pete Sampras.         
	Federer doesnt have to worry about defending champion Rafael Nadal, who missed the tournament with bad knees.         
	An injury ended Ivanovics Wimbledon, too. She said she hurt her thigh hitting an ace to erase a break point in the opening game of the second set.         
	I didnt feel anything up until that point, she said. When I landed, I just felt a sharp pain on my inner thigh, and I couldnt step on my leg ever since.         
	She took a 10-minute break during the first game of the second set to have her left thigh taped by a trainer. She returned for two more points, but after hitting a service winner to take the game, she began crying as she walked to her chair and told the umpire she was retiring.         
	Then she hugged a sympathetic Williams. This is Wimbledon. Its the last place you want to have an injury that you cant overcome, Williams said. So Im wishing her a lot of luck in her recovery.         
	Ivanovic said she didnt yet know the extent of the injury. She hasnt reached a Grand Slam quarter final since winning the 2008 French Open and briefly claiming the No. 1 ranking. No. 3-seeded Venus dominated from the start, taking a 5-0 lead before Ivanovic finally won a game 27 minutes into the match. Venus came into the match having won 29 consecutive sets at Wimbledon, the longest such streak since Martina Navratilova won 40 in a row in 1982-85.         
	Williams next plays Radwanska, who took advantage of some shaky moments by the 124th-ranked Oudin, the last remaining qualifier. The American flubbed an easy volley to lose the first set, and faded after leading by a break in the second set.         
	Im very proud of myself how I did here, said Oudin, who pulled the biggest upset in the first week by beating former No. 1 Jelena Jankovic. (AP)

                                                     Distress in mid-air, Huma in Chennai
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Huma                           
	Chennai: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akrams wife was Tuesday admitted to Chennais Apollo Hospital after her condition worsened midway through her flight to Singapore, forcing the air ambulance to make an emergency landing in the city.         
	Huma was being flown from Lahore to Singapore for neurosurgery to remove three tumours from her brain.         
	As the air ambulance was flying over India her condition worsened and the doctor accompanying the patient wanted her admitted in an emergency ward at the earliest since reaching Singapore would have taken another four hours.         
	The pilot immediately contacted the Chennai air traffic control at 4pm and his request was relayed to the civil aviation authorities in Delhi since it was a Pakistani aircraft.         
	When the civil aviation and external affairs officers learnt about the identity of the patient and her condition they cleared the aircraft for emergency landing and also issued temporary visas to all eight persons aboard.         
	The foreign office also asked the airport authorities to provide the necessary assistance in reaching the patient to a hospital without further delay.         
	The plane landed at the Chennai airport at 4.20pm and a waiting Indian Airlines ambulance transported the patient to the hospital in central Chennai.         
	Huma was put on an emergency support system in the hospital, but the doctors said her condition continued to be critical.         
	Huma is accompanied by husband Wasim, her brother, a doctor, a nurse and an attendant.         
	 The aircraft crew consists of the pilot and a co-pilot.

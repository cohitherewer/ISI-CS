The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Will it be Mumbai, not back to London, for the world body?
                                                                                                                       7                                        Will it be Mumbai, not back to London, for the world body?
    - ICC HQ shift 
  -  Buzz is that a much bigger game is being played             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            A section of ICCs current HQ, in Dubai                                 
	Calcutta: Nobody is willing to go on record, but the buzz is that a much bigger game is being played behind the move to take the International Cricket Council (ICC) HQ back to the UK.         
	Indeed, well-placed sources in three countries have told The Telegraph that the idea actually is to have the HQ in India, specifically Mumbai, which is the power centre within the world body.         
	In any case, the move to get away from Dubai, and return to the UK, defies logic as the reason for the shift (from Lords, in 2005) remains unchanged  stiff taxes.         
	Moreover, Gordon Brown, then the chancellor of the exchequer, who declined to give exemptions, is now the Prime Minister!         
	Nobody has come forward to explain why it has suddenly become necessary, but the talk in some quarters is that, because of the high cost of living, maintaining the HQ in Dubai is financially draining.         
	Doesnt sound convincing, particularly when one takes into account that the ICCs earnings there arent taxed. Its definitely a huge plus.         
	The move, incidentally, has been initiated/strongly endorsed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the England and Wales Cricket Board.         
	Not for a moment has the government in the UK indicated that the ICCs earnings wont be taxed... This whole business of taking the HQ back to the UK is a charade... Eventually, the BCCI will say lets have it in Mumbai and everybody will fall in line, is how one source put it, on Saturday.         
	According to another source, the move could be set in motion after June next year, when Sharad Pawar succeeds David Morgan as the ICC president.         
	Pawar, a former BCCI chief, is currently the ICC vice-president. Then, hes a senior member of Manmohan Singhs cabinet and may well be able to get exemptions from his government.         
	That, surely, would please the ICC.         
	Not that any one country is, at the moment, in a position to challenge Indias hold on the world body.         
	Its interesting that Zimbabwes Peter Chingoka, who has always had the blessings of the BCCI (starting from the days of Jagmohan Dalmiya), has called for the HQ to be shifted to a location where all members would be able to attend meetings.         
	Chingoka is considererd very close to his countrys controversial President, Robert Mugabe, and theres no guarantee that the UK would issue him a visa.         
	Apparently, to gain Cricket Australias support, the BCCI has promised its chairman, Jack Clarke, that it would back his bid for the ICCs vice-presidency.         
	The post will get vacant once Pawar moves up and the nominations must be filed by the end of this year. By rotation, its the turn of Australia/ New Zealand.         
	It couldnt be confirmed, but yet another source revealed that New Zealand Cricket (NZC)s chairman, Allan Isaac, isnt too keen on one day getting to head the world body.         
	However, if NZC decides to propose somebody like Sir John Anderson, instead, then it could strain relations between Australia and New Zealand. After all, Malcolm Gray (Australia) was the ICC president as recently as 2000-2003.         
	Australia and New Zealand are co-hosts of the 2015 World Cup and, so, much bad blood between the two wont do any of them any good.         
	Clearly, the vice-presidency issue will have to be handled delicately.         
	Isaac has succeeded Sir John, who sat on the ICC board for a number of years, and isnt short on experience as a cricket administrator.         
	Clarke, by the way, is seen as ambitious and has much in common (in his approach) with those calling the shots in the BCCI.         
	Within the ICC, for example, the Clarkes see the board as being supreme in all matters. In other words, then, even somebody like chief executive Haroon Lorgat gets to play a minor role.         
	The next few weeks will determine what shape the script actually takes, but its unlikely that any country would oppose anything proposed by the BCCI.         
	All the moolah, if anybody needs a reminder, comes from India. Its the BCCI which controls the cricket market.

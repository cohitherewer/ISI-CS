The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rubens admits Williams talks
                                                   Rubens admits Williams talks
                      
	Sao Paulo: Brawn GP driver Rubens Barrichello Tuesday said he was in talks with Williams but denied reports that he had already signed a deal with the Formula One rivals.         
	The Brazilian said that he was also in discussions to renew with his present team and that he was sure to remain in Formula One next season.         
	That its true there are talks with Williams and with Brawn, theres no doubt. But that I havent signed any papers, I can also say I havent, Barrichello said. I read about everything thats been said and made it quite clear that this is a very special moment for me in Formula One. Today I feel very honoured that there are teams trying (for me), that there are teams Im talking to and that my situation is a lot better than for some time.         
	Barrichello, second in the drivers championship 14 points behind British teammate Jenson Button, must win his home Grand Prix Sunday to carry the title decision over to the last race in Abu Dhabi. Even that might not be enough since Button can lift the title with a race to spare if he comes in third or higher on Sunday.         
	Barrichello, whose best Brazilian Grand Prix finish at Interlagos was third in 2004 with Ferrari, will base his decision about his future on the most competitive car. Brawn lead the constructors championship this season, whereas Willia-ms are sixth. Im at a very privileged stage of my career in being able to choose the car in which Ill compete. I want a competitive car for next season, he said.         
	Barrichello, at 37 the oldest driver in Formula One who has raced in a record 286 Grands Prix, believes he has reached the peak in his career. Its my best season and the start of reaping things I sowed in the past, said Barrichello, twice title runner-up with Ferrari.

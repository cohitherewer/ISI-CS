	 The Indian Football Association (IFA) and the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) are seemingly on a collision course over availability of grounds for the ongoing CFL Super Division. With the big three backing the IFA secretary Utpal Ganguli to the hilt by saying that they wont play anywhere other than their home grounds, Ganguli is now readying himself to flex muscles.       
	Its irrational on the CABs part not to let us use the Mohammedan Sporting and Mohun Bagan ground. Anyway cricket is not played at those two grounds. And then CAB league matches are also not played on Mondays and Fridays. Those days CFL matches can be hosted on these grounds, Ganguli said on Wednesday. The CAB, meanwhile, has categorically said that as per the rules, Maidan belongs to them from November to February.           
	 Shabbir Ali was named as Bengal coach for Santosh Trophy to be held in Goa in April next year. Debashish Mukherjee will be the goalkeeper coach. The decision was taken at the IFA coaches sub-committee meeting on Wednesday.      
	Tamal Sen and Jagadish Ghosh will be in charge of U-21 team, while Sarajit Sarkar and Arpan Dey will be with the U-19 team. Amitabha Ghosh and Arun Saha will look after the U-13 boys.      
	Meanwhile, the IFA also announced the Bengal squad for the zonal qualifiers of the Coca-Cola Mir Iqbal Trophy. Saheb Mondal will lead the 20-member team, which leaves for Jamshedpur on Friday.                 
	 Wild card entrant Biplab Das shocked third seed Farid Alam 6-4, 6-3 in a mens singles match at the BTA Ranking Mens amp; Veterans Tennis Tournament organised by the Cossipore Club.

	 Defending champion Chikkarangappa took the sole lead after the second round of the Lalit Suri Eastern India Championship which is being played at the Tollygunge Club. A second-round 69 has put him at three-under for the tournament, one shot clear of second-placed Ashbeer Saini.

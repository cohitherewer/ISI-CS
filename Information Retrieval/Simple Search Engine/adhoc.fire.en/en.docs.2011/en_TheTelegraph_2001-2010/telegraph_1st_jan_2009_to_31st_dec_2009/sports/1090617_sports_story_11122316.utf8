	Nottingham: Ajantha Mendis took three for nine and opener Tillekaratne Dilshan top-scored with 48 as Sri Lanka booked their place in the semi-finals of the World Twenty20 with a 48-run victory over New Zealand at Trent Bridge on Tuesday.         
	New Zealand collapsed from 64 for two to 110 all out from 17 overs to make an exit from the event.         
	Earlier, Sri Lanka had scored 158 for five, with Mahela Jayawardene (41 not out) and Kumar Sangakkara (35) putting on 50 for the fourth wicket after Dilshan had laid the platform.         
	Captain Daniel Vettori was the pick of the New Zealand bowlers, returning figures of two for 32.         
	Chasing 159, Martin Guptill top-scored for New Zealand with 43 off 34 balls, but Isuru Udana responded with two for 17, cleverly varying his pace. The introduction of Mendis then inspired a collapse that effectively knocked the Black Caps out.         
	Having lost the toss and been asked to field, New Zealand landed an early blow when Sanath Jayasuriya was caught off the third ball of the innings  the first he faced  offering a simple chance to Ross Taylor after he top-edged a delivery from Nathan McCullum.         
	The decision to move Chamara Silva up the order to number three then backfired when he mishit a ball from Kyle Mills straight to Jacob Oram in the fourth over.         
	Dilshan and Sangakkara steadied the innings with a 50 partnership from 32 balls until the former was caught by Brendon McCullum off Vettori in the 12th over.         
	Jayawardene smashed Vettori into the top tier of the pavilion two overs later and then Mills went for 14 runs in the 16th as Sri Lanka looked to accelerate.         
	Sangakkara was, however, dismissed in the next over, caught by Scott Styris off Vettori.         
	Jehan Mubarak (8) was the last Sri Lankan wicket to fall, caught leg before to Ian Butler in the 19th over.         
	New Zealand made six from Udanas opening over before hitting Jayasuriya out of the attack in the second when Aaron Redmond hit three fours and a six from consecutive deliveries.         
	But with the fifth ball of the next over, Mubarak caught Brendon McCullum off Udana and two overs later Lasith Malinga removed Redmond with a slow, full toss that he clipped straight to Silva at mid-wicket.         
	With Guptill at the crease New Zealand still had realistic hopes of victory, but in the ninth over Taylor was stumped by Sangakkara off Mendis, triggering a batting collapse.         
	Three balls later Mendis bowled Styris and Sri Lanka were in the driving seat. Udana bowled Oram in the 13th over, reducing New Zealand to 93 for five, and then, the key wicket of Guptill fell in the 14th over when he was caught on the boundary by Angelo Mathews off Jayasuriya.         
	Sri Lanka then rapidly went through New Zealands tail, the innings and the Black Caps participation in the tournament ending when Mills was run out by a direct hit from Dilshan with three overs to spare. Sangakkara felt his side had set a challenging target.         
	It was a great batting performance to start off with, the captain said. We really stuck it out there.         
	It was probably a bad option to open the bowling with Sanath (Jayasuriya), but we always knew that once the field spread out we could always pull them back.         
	Vettori admitted his side had been the second best, saying 160 was a gettable target.         
	We got off to a decent start but the capitulation in the middle left us with no chance, he said.         
	They bowled well and deserved to win, and we didnt take any of our opportunities against the top teams.         
	The result ensured Sri Lanka finished first in group F, winning all three matches in the Super Eight.         
	New Zealand exit the tournament having beaten only Ireland in the second round.           (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Just another day for Abhinav Bindra
                                                     Just another day for Abhinav Bindra
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                              
	Calcutta: August 11 will forever remain a landmark in Indian sport, but for Abhinav Bindra, the first anniversary of him creating history was just like any other day.         
	I didnt wake up feeling different... Of course, I did sleep well last night, unlike my experience in Beijing, where Id tossed and turned in the hours leading up to what became such a big day in my life, Bindra told The Telegraph on Tuesday evening.         
	The absence of a personal TV set in the Games Village had made it worse for the crack shot. Back then, hed been edgy and a bit scared, but eager too.         
	Speaking from his farmhouse off Chandigarh, on the Patiala road, Indias only individual gold medallist in the Olympics added: I intend always to treat August 11 as a normal day... Today, for example, I did the usual things in the morning Practised at my private shooting range and trained physically         
	In the afternoon, though, my father (Apjit) and I watched a video of the 10m air rifle final... That did bring back happy memories and gave me another opportunity to reflect on the years of hard work...         
	Beijing, indeed, saw the realisation of a long-cherished dream... Having achieved it, what stimulates me now isnt the end result, but the process of trying to improve as an athlete and as a shooter... Trying to get better is definitely a peak of sorts I intend conquering This process is, for me, a driving force.         
	Talking exclusively the other day, Bindra had said: I am starting to forget about my glorious past and trying to find newer peaks to climb.         
	Living in the past is, clearly, a strict no-no for the 26-year-old.         
	Bindra confirmed that the 10m air rifle would remain his choice for competitions. I may shoot something different (at training), but that would just be to break the monotony, nothing more... Some have a misconception, but the fact is Im not leaving the 10m air rifle.         
	Being the world and Olympic champion, why should he?         
	Asked if there was a message for young sportsmen and sportswomen, Bindra replied: Stay committed to your dream... Keep working towards it... Be persistent, for persistence gets rewarded...         
	Bindra, incidentally, would remain at the farmhouse for the rest of the day as well.         
	My mother (Babli) isnt at home, but in New Delhi with my sister Divya, who is on her way to motherhood... Only my father and I are here and there are no plans to hit town, he signed off.         
	Perhaps, the Beijing video will be watched again

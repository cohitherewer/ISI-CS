  - Nehru Cup National coach Houghton heaps praise on Steven Dias amp; Mahesh Gawli       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            World boxing champion MC Mary Kom presents the Man of the Match award to Bhaichung Bhutia in New Delhi on Wednesday. (AP)                                 
	New Delhi: Bob Houghton described Indias victory against Sri Lanka in the Nehru Cup on Wednesday as a top class performance.         
	A visibly happy Houghton, who was confident of India reaching the final, said: It was a top class performance, one of the best matches in recent times. We dominated the game throughout the 90 minutes. Though its still a long way to go, I think we have a good chance to reach the final.         
	But then, if Lebanon beat Syria tomorrow (Thursday), the whole equation will change.         
	The Indian coach was of view that India could have won the match by a bigger margin. The ball hit the post three times. Chetris strike in the first half was cancelled for off side but that was a doubtful decision. I thought it was a legitimate goal, Houghton said.         
	Houghton was unhappy that India could not keep their slate clean and conceded the equaliser in the 69th minute. I am disappointed the way we conceded the goal. The corner kick could have been cleared easily.         
	The 61-year-old British coach was full praise for Steven Dias and Mahesh Gawli and described their performance as fantastic.         
	Dias was very good. He played a role behind almost every attack. Gawlis performance was excellent. He had a wonderful match. If he played as right back, he could have been the best in Asia.         
	Houghton, however, admitted that it was difficult to convince Gawli to play as a wing back.         
	After all, he has been playing as a central defender for 10 years now.         
	Skipper Bhaichung Bhutia, who was adjudged the Man of the Match for the second time in a row, said the three points came as a bigger satisfaction.         
	The way the team is playing, we should be in the final, he commented.

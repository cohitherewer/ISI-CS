	Pattaya: Sania Mirzas quest for a second WTA singles title continues after the Indian ace lost 5-7, 1-6 against world No.5 and top seed Vera Zvonareva in the final of the $220,000 Pattaya Open here Sunday.         
	A tired Sania, whose only WTA singles triumph has come at the Hyderabad Open in her breakthrough 2005 season, fizzled out after a brief fightback in the one hour and 17 minutes long contest.         
	No excuses but I just wish I felt fresher, a dejected Sania later said. I had a long singles match on Saturday and then had to play the doubles. I felt tired, she added.         
	The injury-ravaged Indian ace, however, was happy to have kick-started her new season on a high. Sania, currently 126th in the WTA rankings, battled a career-threatening wrist injury last year and was off-court for most of 2008.         
	I couldnt ask for a better way to start the year. I just came back to the tour at the Australian Open and won the mixed and I reached the final in my second tournament. I feel better and better each week, she added.         
	Sania fought her heart out against the formidable opponent but the Russian drew from her vast experience to halt the Indians brilliant run.         
	The first set was fiercely contested and both traded many breaks, but unforced errors in pressure situations did Sania in. Once she lost the first set and squandered the chance to break Zvonareva in the opening game of the second set, Sania was all but out of the match. Sania could have got an early lead at the start of the match as she had two break points in the opening game but she squandered both.         
	Sania then broke Zvonareva in the third game but the Russian did not allow Sania to run away with the lead as she fought back and broke the Indian in the very next game.         
	After trading breaks in the ninth and 10th games, Zvonareva held her serve in the 11th to make it 6-5.         
	It was imperative for Sania to win the next game and stretch the set to a tie-breaker but the Russian pounced on the second breakpoint to settle the issue.         
	Sania had started well in the second set, earning a breakpoint in the opening game but Zvonareva warded off the danger.         
	The first three games went with serve before Zvonareva converted a breakpoint in the fourth game to take a 3-1 lead and consolidated it further by holding her serve in the next game.         
	Trailing 1-4, a comeback looked difficult for the Indian. The Russian broke Sania once more and then held her serve to claim the title.         
	The runner-up effort fetched Sania $19,000 and 200 ranking points which would see her return to the top-100 in the WTA rankings. The Indian could be placed at 92 when the rankings are updated on Monday.         
	Next up for Sania is the $2 million Barclays Championship in Dubai (which began on Sunday) where she has a wild-card entry. The Hyderabadi faces Ekaterina Makarova of Russia in the first round and could run into world No.3 Jelena Jankovic in the third.         
	Earlier, on Saturday, Sania had edged past world No.51 Magdalena Rybarikova in the first semi-final, winning 6-4, 5-7, 6-1.         
	The unseeded Indian faced a tough challenge from her eighth-seed Slovakian opponent but eventually came out triumphant from a contest that lasted two-hours.           (PTI)

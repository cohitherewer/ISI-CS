The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barabati option being considered by KKR
                                                   Barabati option being considered by KKR
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The management of Kolkata Knight Riders hasnt yet decided if all the home matches will be played at Eden Gardens which was the teams home ground during the first edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL). There is talk that a couple of matches may actually be hosted by Cuttacks Barabati Stadium.         
	Co-owner Jay Mehta did inspect the facilities at the Barabati, which recently hosted a floodlit one-day International against England. The process of assessing the facilities there is, however, still on.         
	Obviously, principal owner Shah Rukh Khan will have the biggest say on the issue.         
	Apparently, there is no bar on the franchise owners looking to spread the game within the region. Reports of some matches being shifted to faraway Ahmedabad have been rubbished by sources spoken to by The Telegraph.         
	Significantly, the dispute over payments is between the Cricket Association of Bengal, which has seen a change of guard after the IPLs first edition, and the governing body of the IPL.         
	 The franchise owners were only required to pay the host association Rs 50 lakh per match and that has already been done by the Knight Riders.

            STAR RACER                                    
	Calcutta: Arnatta, a hot favourite from trainer Vijay Singhs yard, returned triumphant, albeit, in a thrilling-finish, to bag the 1,100m Yerevan Cup, the main attraction in Sundays eight-event race-card. Jockey C. Alford partnering the Placerville-Mitzvah daughter had the 3-10 favourite settled in fifth till a furlong from home before making an all-out effort for half-a-length victory over the early leaders Glory Of North and Shes Superb. Vijays Quantum Of Solace (Neeraj Rawal-up) had recorded another easy win earlier in the afternoon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Agnes Szavay shows the door to Venus
                                                   Agnes Szavay shows the door to Venus
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                                Agnes Szavay celebrates her third-round victory over Venus Williams at Roland Garros on Friday. (AFP)      
	Paris: World No. 3 Venus Williams was knocked out of the French Open in the third round by Agnes Szavay on Friday.         
	Venus, who had needed to save a match point on Thursday against Lucie Safarova just to get into the third round, was outplayed 6-0, 6-4 by Hungarian Szavay to go out at this stage of the competition for the third year in a row.         
	It was only the 14th time in 662 career matches that Venus lost a set at love. The seven-time Grand Slam champion was playing for the third straight day.         
	It was a dismal performance from the reigning Wimbledon champion who has clawed her way back up the world rankings along with sister Serena.         
	Szavay wrapped up the first set in just 30 minutes yanking her opponent from side to side and showing better footwork at the net. Venus did grab a glimmer of hope by breaking the Hungarians serve to lead 4-3 in the second, but with the gusting wind playing havoc with her service throw up, she lost the next three games to end her campaign.         
	Szavay, a quarter finalist at the 2007 US Open, will next take on Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia with a place in the quarter finals the prize for the winner.         
	Elsewhere in the womens competition, defending champion Ana Ivanovic breezed into the last 16. The Serbian, wearing strapping on her troublesome right knee but showing no signs that the injury was hampering her, had too much power and all-round skill for Iveta Benesova of the Czech Republic, winning 6-0, 6-2.         
	That put her into a match-up against either ninth seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus or Carla Suarez Navarro of Spain with a place in the quarter finals going to the winner. The 21-year-old, who became the world No.1 after her win here last year, but who has struggled for form and fitness since then, said she had played one of her best matches of the year.         
	I feel fit and ready to handle any kind of opponent, she said. My game is coming back and I feel more comfortable. I really missed competition last month. These kind of matches help for the tough matches ahead in the second week.         
	(The) score doesnt indicate how hard I had to work for some points, Ivanovic added. She started playing much, much better in the second set, and started hitting the ball much heavier. I just played really good and stayed in the moment and did what I had to do out there.         
	Portuguese teen prodigy Michelle Larcher de Brito, meanwhile, saw her dream of becoming the youngest ever womens winner in Paris bite the dust.         
	At 16 years and four months, the youngest player left in the womens draw, Larcher de Brito went down 7-6 (7-3), 6-2 to Frances Aravane Rezai in a bad-tempered clash that saw the players trading barbs over the Portuguese players ear-splitting on-court vocals.         
	Rezai, on several occasions, complained to the umpire that the high-pitched screams that accompanied her opponents shot making were putting her off with De Brito insisting she was doing nothing wrong. De Brito, the latest player to emerge from Nick Bollitieris famed Florida academy, clawed her way back from a break down to force a tie-break against Rezai, but double faults let her down in that.         
	In the second set, she quickly fell behind as her service game wobbled again and despite saving three match points at 1-5 down, she could do nothing to prevent the 22-year-old Rezai from reaching the fourth round for the first time in five attempts.         
	Rezai, one of only two Frenchwomen left after the early defeats of Amelie Mauresmo, Marion Bartoli and Alize Cornet, will meet top seed Dinara Safina in the fourth round.         
	 Safina, the current world No. 1, defeated compatriot Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of Russia 6-2, 6-0. Safina, who is trying to win her first Grand Slam title after losing in the final at Roland Garros last year and in the Australian Open final this year, has lost only four games in three rounds. She won her first match 6-0, 6-0 and lost only one game in each set in the second round.         
	When I broke her, I feel I started to play much more aggressively, and then I was dominating, Safina said.         
	Once you break up, its easier to go for your shots and to be much more aggressive on the court, the Russian added.

	Mumbai: Nigerian striker Murithala Ali scored a hattrick to help Mahindra United beat Air India 4-0 in the I-League at the Cooperage Thursday.         
	Ali, who scored his second hattrick of the season after achieving a similar feat against Salgaocar, struck in the 41st, 49th and 58th minutes after Mohammed Rafi put Mahindra in the lead in the 10th minute.         
	Ali notched his first goal off a Paresh Shivalkar pass and netted in the second one from a corner. He completed his hattrick slotting home a rebound shot off the Air India custodian.         
	After a series of four drawn encounters, the Mahindra outfit, who dominated the clash with fine passing, smooth movement and mid-field control, bounced back strongly with the victory to get their title challenge back on track and also took their points tally to 14. Standing third in the table, Mahindra are yet to lose a tie.         
	Languishing third from bottom, AI (five points) are still searching for their first win at home.         
	In Margao, Dempo overcame a first-half deficit to defeat Viva Kerala 3-1 and returned to the top of the points table at the Nehru Stadium.           (PTI)

                                                   PCB refuses to sign FTP
                      
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has refused to sign the new Future Tours Programme, for the period 2012 to 2020, unless the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) revises the draft.         
	Sources in PCB confirmed that officials had voiced strong objections at the ICC meetings last week in London when they learnt that the BCCI had not scheduled a single bilateral series with Pakistan in their proposed draft of the new FTP.         
	The Pakistan representatives had made it clear at the meeting that they would not sign the FTP if the BCCI did not revise the draft.           (PTI)

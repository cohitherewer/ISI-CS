                                                   Handle Symmo with care: Smith
                      
	Durban: South African captain Graeme Smith feels Andrew Symonds return to Australias national team could be disruptive if the all-rounder was not managed carefully.         
	I dont really know how hell impact the team in his personality and what has gone on, how thats going to affect the team environment, Smith said.         
	It can be disruptive if he still has issues and it can disrupt other players. So I guess how they manage it is going to be the key, the South African skipper was quoted as saying in Cape Town by a local newspaper on Friday.         
	Symonds, who was dropped from the national team following a troubled summer and a knee operation, has been recalled to national one-day side for series against Pakistan, beginning April 22 in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.         
	He has a lot of experience, he has played a lot of key knocks for them. He does provide them with a little bit more balance, I guess. He gives them a few bowling options. Hes a great fielder. In terms of a cricketer, I think theyd love to have him back, Smith said.         
	Smith also said he was worried about how Herschelle Gibbs would fit back into the team environment after his alcohol rehabilitation course in January.         
	You always have apprehension when Herschelle is coming back into the team environment. But I think the key is Herschelle has taken responsibility for himself. He has really fitted back into the (team) environment. He has handled himself extremely well since he has come back.         
	That really made it a lot easier for us, and I guess that onus is going to be on Andrew Symonds when he joins the squad, he said. (PTI)

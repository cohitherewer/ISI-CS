	Calcutta: CESC regained the Bengal Hockey Associations first division group A league title beating BNR 2-1 in their final round-robin league championship tie on Friday. Last years champions Punjab SC finished runners-up.         
	The round-robin championship leg involved the top-four teams from the 15-team group A league. CESC dominated the proceedings from the outset and led by a goal at the breather. BNR came back strongly in the second session to equalise but CESC scored in the closing stages to seal the title.         
	CESC took the lead through Amrit Xavier Soreng in the 22nd minute after receiving a pass from Sukhen Saha inside the D. CESC went all out, forcing two penalty corners early in the match, and BNR were restricted inside their own half.         
	Sunil Kujur missed a golden opportunity to double the lead when he failed to score with only the goalkeeper to beat. Kujur was the livewire in the CESC forwardline with his sudden bursts of speed and good stickwork.         
	The second half saw BNR staging a comeback as CESC took things a bit easy. Arun Kumar struck in the 57th minute capitalising on a defensive lapse. But CESC came back with a bang as Anil Ekka sounded the board following a flick from Kujur five minutes later. BNR were done in by CESCs dominance in the last ten minutes.         
	This is a reward for their hard work The players have put in a lot of effort this season and Im happy it has paid off, said CESC coach Anil Maity. He credited the win to team effort but also picked Anil Ekka, Gendra Tika, Edmond Karketta and Jagdip Singh for special mention. Bir Bahadur Chetri, a member of the gold winning squad in the Moscow Olympics and a former CESC coach, said: There are a lot of talented players in the state. The standard of the game was encouraging this time If only these guys could play on astroturf on their home turf         
	The following are the winners and runners-up in the other divisions  Group B: Muslim Institute (winners); FCI (runners-up); Second division: Behala SA (winners); BSF South Bengal (runners-up); Third division: Entally SC (winners); Calcutta Kennel amp; Athletic Club (runners-up)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chad Campbell steals show in first round
                                                     Chad Campbell steals show in first round

	Augusta: The Masters roar is back. Chad Campbell, the moon-faced Texan, opened with five consecutive birdies on his way to a 65.         
	Padraig Harrington, in search of a third straight major title, was jolted into action by the cheers rolling across the green slopes of Augusta. Hunter Mahan splattered the course with red numbers coming in.         
	It seemed that everyone was making birdies except Tiger Woods. Then he made his move. Just when we were wondering why he always makes such a hash of the first round of the Masters, Tiger got on a roll. Suddenly the roars became even louder.         
	Daly kicked out of another club Augusta chairman Billy Payne got it right. After Arnie had battered the opening tee shot down the middle and followed his ball with a right cross, Payne said: Have fun this week. No Augusta chairman has ever spoken with such casual joy. Its gonna be one hell of a week, Billy.         
	Should we take Campbell seriously as a first-round leader. The jury is out on that one and may never come back in the room. Seven years ago Campbell was voted by his peers as the next big thing. Well, a few big things have come and gone since then and Campbell isnt one of them. But Tiger called him a wonderful striker and praise doesnt come much higher.         
	You just wonder if Campbell has what the Americans call intestinal fortitude. He led the Masters by three shots at the halfway stage in 2003 and blew up. Thursday he was nine under par after 16 holes, a course record in sight, and bogeyed his last two holes.         
	Woods says he has been held back at Augusta in recent years by streaky putting. Maybe. He has always been defensive about his long game, and Augusta is now a course where you have to drive long and straight, a combination that Tiger has struggled with in recent years.         
	Now that they have rebuilt his knee after last years heroic US Open victory Tiger may just stand on more solid foundations. At least he is in contention after a day on which some of the other big names  Phil Mickelson, Sergio Garcia, Ernie Els and Retief Goosen  failed to break par.         
	Americans dominated the leaderboard. Even the 50-year-old Larry Mize, the champion 22 years ago was round in 67. How crazy. It wasnt such a good day for the English despite so much early promise. When have we said that before.         
	The best of them was Ross Fisher who shot 69 on his Masters debut and then said he was disappointed. It is hard to feel sad on a beautiful spring morning in Augusta when the azaleas are blooming and the Fish is jumping. But Fisher knew that he had blown a chance to be king for the day and might learn a great deal from a tour of Padraig Harrington.         
	Last year Trevor Immelman won the Masters at the age of 28, the same age as Fisher, and acknowledged how much he had gained from observing Harringtons forensic approach to golf. Thursday the Irishman was round in 69, the first time in seven years that Harrington has broken par in his opening round at Augusta.         
	For eight holes Fisher was part of that buzz. He was walking the dream. He had just holed a slippy 12-footer for birdie and was leading the Masters on 4 under par. No one else was close. The game seemed easy. He crushed another drive down the ninth and flicked a short iron onto the green, careful not to spin it back off the front as so many have done before him.         
	Playing partner Kevein Sutherland putted first, so Fisher knew his putt was quick. Then Augusta whispered something in Fishers ear, something like: Be careful, be very careful. But young men arent careful. Fisher hit the putt six foot past and missed the return.         
	Harrington said Augustas greens were as fast as he had ever known them, but kept his score together with supreme putting from long range. That is the result of much analysis and hard work. Fishers putter got away from him coming in and he finished with consecutive birdies.         
	Fisher has only played two majors in America at this stage of his career  last years US Open and PGA  and he missed the cut in both. Now hes talking about the Grand Slam. But then he does drive a blue Lamborghini, so he is not short of front.         
	Fishers wobble at the end presaged something of a what if day for the English contingent, but how many days like that has Augusta known over the years. The place almost defines the phrase what if. In the end Fisher was the only Englishman to break 70 as the other six all finished in the 70-74 range though not quite dead, but much to be done.

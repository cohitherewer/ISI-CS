            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: The less-fancied Lycia Falcon took a giant leap, beating the former Derby winner, Regal Connection  trained by Vijay Singh and ridden by C.Alford  on his way to an easy victory in the 1,400m Romantic Liaison Cup, Sundays main event. D.K. Ashish partnered the four-year-old to a start-to-finish victory. However, the jockey failed to keep a straight course in the stretch-run. Vijays dominance was otherwise complete on the day that was ruled by favourites. The trainer saddled four winners. Alford helped Vijay lead in three while Neeraj Rawal completed his days tally.

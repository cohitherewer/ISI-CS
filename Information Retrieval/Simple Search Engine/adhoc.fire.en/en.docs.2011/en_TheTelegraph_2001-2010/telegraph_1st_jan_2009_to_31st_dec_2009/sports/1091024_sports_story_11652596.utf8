The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Benfica thump Everton 
                                                   Benfica thump Everton 
                      
	Berne: Javier Saviola and Oscar Cardozo scored two goals apiece and defender Luisao was also on target as Benfica thumped Everton 5-0 in the Europa League on Thursday.         
	Shakhtar Donetsk, who won the Uefa Cup in its last year, Sporting Lisbon and FC Salzburg all won to maintain their 100 percent records at the halfway mark in the group stage.         
	AS Roma ensured an unhappy night for English teams with an injury-time equaliser in a 1-1 draw at Fulham, while city rivals Lazio also struck in added time to beat Villarreal 2-1.         
	Everton travelled to Lisbon with six points from their first two Group I outings but were plagued by injuries and fell behind to a goal from Argentine Saviola after 14 minutes.         
	The visitors were taken apart after the break when Paraguay striker Oscar Cardozo scored twice in a minute, turning in crosses from Saviola and Angel Di Maria, and Brazil defender Luisao headed in the fourth goal from a corner in the 52nd.         
	Saviola added a fifth late on to hand Everton their heaviest defeat in Europe after a result that left Benfica level with them at the top of the group on six points from three games.         
	Brazils Fernandinho gave Shakhtar Donetsk an early lead from the penalty spot against Toulouse before his compatriot Luiz Adriano added two more.         
	Werder Bremen, beaten by Shakhtar in the Uefa Cup final in May before that competition was replaced by the Europa League, looked set to maintain their 100 percent record in Group L.         
	Though Werder Bremen drew 2-2 with the hosts at Austria Vienna, draw means Werder are still atop with seven points in their group.           (REUTERS)

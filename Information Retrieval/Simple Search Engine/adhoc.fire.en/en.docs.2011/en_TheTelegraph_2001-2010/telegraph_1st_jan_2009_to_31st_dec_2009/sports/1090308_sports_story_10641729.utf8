                                                   Practice paying off: Raina 
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Christchurch: Suresh Raina, who has been a consistent performer for India on the tour of New Zealand so far, said Saturday that quality practice before the series is the only reason behind his and his teammates success.               
	The following are excerpts               
	The secret of his excellent performance on the tour so far         
	We had quality practice before the tour. I think it is really important to prepare yourself before the game. We are coming good now, hopefully it will remain the same.         
	His plan at the start of the series         
	Its good to have the confidence of the coach and the captain. My plan was to just play normally, read the situation and get a partnership going.         
	If he is now feeling secure about his place in the team         
	I feel good if I can contribute to the teams cause. When I was on my way back from injury, the team was packed  there was Robin (Uthappa), Rohit (Sharma). I didnt play in Australia, I played domestic cricket and worked very hard on my game. This is my opportunity, I feel I can do better.         
	If the frequent change in the batting order is a problem         
	I am comfortable with the changes in batting order. As long as the team is doing really well, I dont mind if Im playing at three, five or six. At the end of the day, we are winning matches. That is the important thing for us. I dont think it has an effect on the psyche of batsmen.         
	His impression on the pitches of New Zealand         
	Its good. Not similar to India. It does a bit initially when you go in to bat. You have to hang in there for a while. You cant just go out and play your shots. You have to select a bowler, read the circumstances, your areas, the opponents game plan and what you are doing on the field. It is really important to do proper preparation before the game. You have to know your game better than the opposition.         
	On playing more shots on the on-side         
	The grounds are small, so you have to pick your areas. Also, it is important see what lines they are bowling to me. If they bowl more full tosses or yorkers, I am trying to make room and hit the ball in the areas in which I am more comfortable. Thats why you get to see more on-side strokes.         
	On the chances of winning Sunday         
	We will try our best. If it doesnt rain, I am confident we will do well. We batted well in the last match, too. If we can win here, it will be good for the rest of the series.

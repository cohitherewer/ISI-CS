The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sublime Brazil outclass US
                                                     Sublime Brazil outclass US

	Pretoria: Brazil whipped up a storm against a hapless US Thursday, turning on the samba style as they sauntered to a 3-0 victory with goals from Felipe Melo, Robinho and Maicon.         
	As storm clouds moved in during the second half of the Confederations Cup Group B game, the Americans knew they had failed to weather it, finishing with 10 men after midfielder Sacha Kljestan was sent off in the 56th minute.         
	Brazil, so lucky to beat Egypt 4-3 with a controversial late penalty in their first match, were at their spectacular best, scoring two absolutely sublime goals.         
	Having opened the scoring as early as the seventh minute when Felipe Melo, the midfielder who is rapidly emerging as one of the key men in the team, rose at the far post to head home a Maicon free kick, Brazil took total charge.         
	Their second in the 20th should be shown over and again as the ultimate in breakaway perfection.         
	DaMarcus Beasley failed to control a Landon Donovan corner in the Brazilian penalty area. The ball was pushed forward to Kaka, who turned and touched to Ramires as the Brazilians hared upfield.         
	Ramires strode forward powerfully, drawing the lone American defender Jonathan Spector towards him, then slipped it through Spectors legs to Robinho who calmly stroked it home past helpless American keeper Tim Howard.         
	It was a breathtaking goal, surpassed only by their third in the 62nd minute. Maicon, Ramires and Felipe Melo combined in an intricate passing movement down the right before Kaka threaded the ball back to Maicon who chipped a delicate right-foot shot over Howard from an acute angle.         
	Like the second, it sent the Loftus Stadium crowd into delirium.         
	The Americans had their share of bad luck though. Kljestan was harshly judged for a relatively mild foul on Ramires, reducing his team to 10 men for the second successive game.         
	In the final eight minutes substitutes Benny Feilhaber and Conor Casey both struck the bar as they searched for a consolation goal.         
	Brazil, coached by Dunga, head Group B with six points.         
	The United States, still without a point after losing their opening game 3-1 to Italy, face almost certain elimination.         
	Meanwhile, in Wednesdays late match at Rustenburg, Bernard Parker scored both goals in South Africas 2-0 victory over Oceania champions New Zealand.         
	Parkers goals, which kept alive his teams chances of reaching the semi-finals, came just three days after he cost his team victory against Iraq by getting in the way of a teammates shot.         
	My teammates supported me after what happened on Sunday, Parker told a news conference. After the game they told me to put it behind me, that it was part of football.         
	When the coach announced the starting line-up for the New Zealand game and I saw that he had put me in, I got my confidence back. I saw he had confidence in me and I was able to put it behind me.         
	Parkers two goals were all South Africa had to show for a dominant performance.         
	We could have had two or three more goals, said coach Joel Santana. I was satisfied with the victory, the way we moved the ball around and the number of opportunities created.         
	South Africa now face European champions Spain in their last Group A game on Saturday.         
	We are going to try and play that game as equals, Santana said.           (REUTERS)

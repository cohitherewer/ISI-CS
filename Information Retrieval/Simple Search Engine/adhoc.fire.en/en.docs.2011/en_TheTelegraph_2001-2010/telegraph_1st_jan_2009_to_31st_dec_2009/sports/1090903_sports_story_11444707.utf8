  - Venus Williams moves ahead marat safin says goodbye               Venus Williams in action on Wednesday                           
	New York: Venus Williams moved on and Marat Safin said goodbye at the US Open on Wednesday.         
	Her left knee heavily wrapped, the third-seeded Venus defeated fellow-American Bethanie Mattek-Sands 6-4, 6-2 in a much easier match than she had two nights before when she fell behind a set before rallying against Russian Vera Dushevina.         
	While Venus advanced to the third round, Safins Grand Slam career was over.         
	Planning to retire at seasons end, the former world No. 1 fell 1-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 to Jurgen Melzer of Austria. Safins career will end with two Grand Slam titles, a smaller number than many experts thought possible when he broke through by beating Pete Sampras in the 2000 U.S. Open final.         
	Former world No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo suffered her earliest ever loss at the US Open on Wednesday, losing 4-6, 0-6 in the second round to Canadian Aleksandra Wozniak.         
	The 17th seed led 2-0 in the first set but then fell apart as the world No. 39 cruised to victory to reach the third round in New York for the first time.         
	It is the first time Mauresmo has gone out of the US Open before the third round in 10 appearances.         
	Wozniak will now play 10th seed Flavia Pennetta after the Italian whitewashed Sania Mirza of India 6-0, 6-0.         
	On Tuesday, the Russian armada of potential US Open champions nearly lost their commander when top seed Dinara Safina had to dig out of a third-set quandary to avoid the humiliation of a first-round exit.         
	Safina, the worlds top-ranked player, uncorked 48 unforced errors and 11 double faults before conquering Australian Olivia Rogowska 6-7, 6-2, 6-4 in two hours and 35 agonising minutes.         
	I didnt break any racket and I didnt get a warning so thats already a positive, said Safina, a triple Grand Slam finalist whose volatile temperament is well documented.         
	While Safina escaped and set up a second-round encounter with Germanys Kristina Barrois, compatriots Maria Sharapova and Svetlana Kuznetsova advanced easily.         
	On the mens side, 2008 runner-up and second seed Andy Murray advanced, along with 2007 finalist Novak Djokovic, the fourth seed, and hard-hitting seventh seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.         
	Safinas near-flameout allowed her to avoid the dubious distinction of becoming the only top-seeded woman to lose in the first round of the US Open.         
	The explosive Muscovite was down 0-3, 15-40 in the final set before making a Houdini-like escape on the sun-drenched hardcourt at Arthur Ashe Stadium.         
	I will never give up, said Safina, still looking for her maiden Grand Slam triumph. So it doesnt matter how I play, I will run and I will stay there forever. I will do everything to win the match.         
	She certainly never gave up but she was certainly helped by the 65 unforced errors and 13 double-faults from her little-known opponent across the net.         
	The match was a festival of errors, each player begging the other to take command. When Rogowska assumed control in the final set, her nerves got the best of her.         
	Im disappointed that I was in a winning position and I let it go, said Rogowska, an 18-year-old wildcard from Melbourne ranked 167th.         
	But its a great learning experience. Im getting confidence that I can match it up to the No. 1 player in the world.         
	I have to get more mentally tougher, and hopefully not let it slip again next time.         
	Another Russian contender Dementieva, routed Frenchwoman Camille Pin 6-1, 6-2 in 59 minutes.         
	Murray used a patient game to defeat big-hitting Ernests Gulbis of Latvia 7-5, 6-3, 7-5, while Djokovic never lost his serve and cruised past Croat Ivan Ljubicic 6-3, 6-1, 6-3. When I needed to, I upped my game, said Murray. My concentration could have been a bit better. But for a first match, it was very good because he played very well.         
	The Scotsman said he enjoyed playing under the lights in Ashe Stadium before a crowd of nearly 24,000.         
	I enjoy playing on that court, he said. Its one of the biggest in the world. Its probably the coolest atmosphere out of all of the Slams.         
	Hopefully Ill play a lot of my matches on there.         
	The fans at Flushing Meadows were gracious to Djokovic, who was booed loudly a year ago after he made some sarcastic comments toward Andy Roddick during a courtside interview.         
	What happened last year was like a fight with a girlfriend, he said. These things happen. It was something that everybody can learn from it.         
	I always felt at home here. I played so well last three years. I see no reason for me thinking about something that happened already.         
	Tsonga beat American Chase Buchanan 6-0, 6-2, 6-1 to set up a second-round match against Finlands Jarkko Nieminen, who beat Italys Fabio Fognini 7-5, 7-6, 6-4.           (AGENCIES)

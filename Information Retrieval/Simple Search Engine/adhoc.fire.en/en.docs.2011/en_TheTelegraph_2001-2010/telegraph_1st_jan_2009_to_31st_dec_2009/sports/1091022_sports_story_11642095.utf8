	Dhanbad: Defending champions Bengal disappointed in their opening match of the East Zone T20 tournament at the Railway Ground Wednesday, suffering a humiliating 35-run defeat at the hands of Assam, who registered their second consecutive victory in the meet.         
	Having won the toss, Assam elected to bat and scored 157 runs for five from their 20 overs. Parwej Aziz top-scored for Assam with 74 off 44 balls, an innings studded with six fours and six sixes.         
	Abhijit Sinhroy too chipped in with a 32-ball 33, assisting Aziz in putting up a respectable total on the board.         
	Sourashish Lahiri was the most successful bowler for Bengal, claiming three wickets for 20 runs from four overs while Ranadeb Bose claimed one.         
	Chasing, Bengal were all out for 122 in 17.4 overs. Bengal were let down by the established batsmen  Rohan Gavaskar could score only four, same as captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla who lasted a mere seven balls at the crease. Opener Wriddhiman Saha was the most successful batsman for Bengal with 40 from 26 balls with the help of six boundaries and a sixer.         
	Deep Dasgupta scored 17 while Manoj Tiwary and Sreevats Goswami both got 18. But the blame doesnt lie with the batsmen exclusively. If the Gavaskars and the Shuklas failed with the bat, so did the pace attack, led by Bose and Ashok Dinda, lack bite.         
	Dhiraj Goswami of Assam claimed three wickets while Sairaj Bahutule and S. Parkayastha claimed two each.

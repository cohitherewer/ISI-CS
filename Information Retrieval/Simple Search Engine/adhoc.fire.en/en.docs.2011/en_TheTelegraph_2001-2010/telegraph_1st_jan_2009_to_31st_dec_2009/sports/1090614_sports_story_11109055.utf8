The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We are confident, says in-formYuvi 
                                                     We are confident, says in-formYuvi 
    - Team India must believe they can win, feels Farokh Engineer           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Yuvraj Singh                                 
	London: Kevin Pietersen may feel that Yuvraj Singh the bowler is a pie chucker, but its his batting thats probably weighing heavy on England, in the lead-up to their Super Eight clash against India.         
	Yuvraj laughed off that jibe, hurled during last Decembers Test series in India, but England cant laugh away his six sixes in an over, off Stuart Broad, in the inaugural World T20.         
	What would be my advice to Broad, if I was the captain and Yuvraj had hit him for sixes on the first two balls? Probably that he should aim for his head! Yuvraj joked on Saturday.         
	The stand-in vice-captain could afford to be light-hearted as hes in form and theres much less pressure on him compared to, say, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	India and England meet at Lords on Sunday, both having lost their opening Super Eight matches. So, its pretty much a do-or-die affair for both.         
	We had an off day yesterday (Friday)... Being the defending champions, theres always pressure... In T20, though, anything may happen... We understand the situation and are confident, Yuvraj pointed out.         
	He added: I dont believe in mind games, but those six sixes would be at the back of my mind... Theres history and theres always history in the making (as well)...         
	Dhoni and Co. were to have a training session in the afternoon, but they decided against sweating it out.         
	Our practice sessions go according to our thoughts, not your (the medias) thoughts, Yuvraj snapped, when asked why the session had been scrapped.         
	The England captain, Paul Collingwood, said that his team was capable of beating the best and that the West Indies had shown the Indians werent unbeatable.         
	He indicated that his quicker bowlers would look to emulate Fidel Edwards, whod been hostility personified against India.         
	Sounding as confident as Yuvraj, Collingwood insisted that the demand of the day wouldnt really affect his team. Sometimes, we play our best cricket when were in such situations...         
	Look, Im hopeful... Losing to the West Indies has been a setback, but the boys must take the field believing they can win, former India wicket-keeper Farokh Engineer told The Telegraph.         
	Such belief would, of course, be a huge driving force.         
	Match starts: 10pm (IST).

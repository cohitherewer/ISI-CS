The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barreto wants Chetri to put on weight
                                                   Barreto wants Chetri to put on weight
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Jose Ramirez Barreto, the top overseas player in the Indian football scene, has asked Sunil Chetri to put on some weight in order to hold his own when he gets to rub shoulders with Europes best.         
	Chetri has been linked with Coventry City in England although a deal is yet to be signed. If he signs on the dotted line, Chetri will become the second Indian after Bhaichung Bhutia to play professional football abroad.         
	Football in Europe is high on body contact. One must be strong mentally and physically. You must put on weight a bit, you have to be stronger, Barreto told The Telegraph on Thursday.         
	The Mohun Bagan striker said Chetri should not worry about having to tackle tall European defenders.         
	Height is not everything. Not all of them are tall. He can work on speed, the Brazilian said.         
	It would be a fantastic opportunity for him. Bhaichung benefited a lot (from playing for Bury FC), he is a different player now. It helped him and Indian football as well.

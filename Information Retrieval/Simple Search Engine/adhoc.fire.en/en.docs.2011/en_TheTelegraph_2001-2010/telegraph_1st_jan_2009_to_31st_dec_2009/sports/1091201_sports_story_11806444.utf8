	Barcelona: Scoring the winner in Barcelonas 1-0 victory over Real Madrid on his Spanish clasico debut Sunday was the perfect way for Zlatan Ibrahimovic to return from an injury layoff.         
	Daniel Alves found Ibrahimovic at the far post with a lofted cross in the 56th minute and the Sweden striker never broke stride as he volleyed past Iker Casillas with his left foot in the high-profile game between Spains arch rivals.         
	Its a very happy moment because it was my first clasico, Ibrahimovic said. It was a fantastic atmosphere, Im really happy.         
	Ibrahimovic beat Casillas at the near post only four minutes after coming for Thierry Henry, playing his first game in three weeks before nearly 100,000 fans at the Camp Nou stadium. When you come into a game from the bench its not easy because the first sprint that you do, you are very tired because your pulse is like 200, the 28-year-old Swede said. But Dani gave me a good cross, I just tried to hit the ball and it went in.         
	Ibrahimovics eighth league goal  he trails only Valencia striker David Villa by two  also allowed Barcelona to overtake Madrid and move two points clear at the top of the standings. It was very important because we played at home and now we are first in the competition and we should bring this to the next game, the former Ajax player said.         
	Im very happy that I came in because I had an injury for 10-15 days and had a hamstring problem. But it went well.         
	Although the victory guarantees nothing for the defending champions chase for another league title, Ibrahimovics strike secured a valuable win against the new-look Madrid  which featured Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka and Karim Benzema.         
	I think Madrid also came here to win, (while) some come to defend, said Ibrahimovic, Barcelonas record signing after arriving from Inter Milan in a swap for Samuel Eto that also included $66 million going to the Italians. In terms of classic derby matches, Ibrahimovic said this one was tops. Inter-Milan is also a big derby with a lot of feelings, a lot of emotions. (But) I think this one is more international, bigger than Inter-Milan, with more people watching the game, Ibrahimovic said.         
	Meanwhile, Real Madrid are taking some positives from the defeat. Madrid played perhaps their best game of the season and, in the words of coach Manuel Pellegrini, should have left the Nou Camp with a better result if not for some missed opportunities by Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, two of its new galacticos.         
	Its not the result we wanted, said the Chilean coach, who has been under pressure since opening day after the club spent more than $365 million to assemble a star-studded lineup that has produced more fizzle than fireworks, despite also including Kaka and Xabi Alonso. At the least Madrid did not deserve to lose. Today (Sunday) we saw a Madrid capable of winning.         
	Bracelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes saved a Ronaldo attempt in the 20th and centre back Carles Puyol scrambled back to block Marcelos clear chance from inside the area six minutes later. Puyol also cleared shots by Gonzlao Higuain and Benzema.         
	I had some luck with Cristianos shot, Valdes said. Madrid enjoyed a man advantage for nearly 30 minutes after Pedro Busquets was shown a red card in the 63rd, but couldnt equalise, with Benzemas strike ballooning over the goal from a two yards out near the end.         
	Still, footballs most expensive lineup remained positive despite a third straight loss to Barcelona, especially coming off of the record 6-2 defeat at the Bernabeu last season. And even more so with Ronaldo back in the starting lineup after a two-month injury layoff.         
	Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas also excelled as he kept Madrid in it right until the end with a magnificent stop on a Lionel Messi attempt after the Argentina winger moved clear into the area with a minute to play.

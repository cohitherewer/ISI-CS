            A STAFF REPORTER            Nirmal Chetri celebrates with captain Syed Rahim Nabi after scoring against Eastern Railway at the Barasat Stadium on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Better late than never! East Bengal finally ended their seven-match winless streak, albeit against a much weaker opponent, Eastern Railway, to begin their 2009 CFL campaign with a 4-0 victory at the Barasat Stadium on Wednesday.         
	The margin, no doubt a handsome one, could have been further enhanced had striker Subhas Singh not decided to squander every opportunity that came his way.         
	Bhowmick decided to field only three  skipper Syed Rahim Nabi, Nirmal Chetri and Mehtab Hossain  of his first team players with the reserves getting a look in. And given the quality of opposition that was up against them, Bhowmick had little to worry.         
	Abel Hammond, the lone foreigner registered for the CFL by East Bengal so far, was off the mark in the ninth minute when his header off a Subhas cross went wide of the far post. But for Bhowmicks wards, who enjoyed the lions share of ball possession, it was only a matter of time before they opened their account.         
	Nirmal Chetri hit the first goal in the 31st minute when his strong header off a Sanju Pradhan free-kick beat the Railways goalkeeper Jayanta Pal hands down. They didnt have to wait long for their second. In the 38th minute, under-19 player Saikat Sinha Roys throw-in found the Eastern Railway defence completely zapped. And Nabi obliged with a powerful volley into the net.         
	The third goal too was the result of a defensive lapse with Nirmal tapping in the ball in the 55th minute from a goalmouth melee. When 3-0 looked to be the final scoreline, youngster Budiram Tudu scored his first goal in East Bengal colours in the 89th minute.         
	But had Harmanjot Singh Khabras scorching left-footer not hit the horizontal and Hammonds powerful free-kick not tipped over the crosspiece, East Bengal could have easily reached the half-a-dozen mark.         
	The match also had a bizarre sight of the fourth referee Bin Mohammed Mollah, instead of using the board during substitutions, signalling to the players issuing directions. When the match commissioner, Subrata Sarkar, was asked about the issue, he said: It was a mistake on the referees part They forgot to bring the board!         
	And if that was not enough, it was later learnt that the IFA had failed to issue any tickets for the match and it was a free-for-all affair Wednesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pak wants Cup ties in Dubai
                                                   Pak wants Cup ties in Dubai
                      
	Karachi: Facing the stark reality of not being able to host any international teams at home, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is keen to make Dubai its neutral home venue with the tacit approval of the big guns behind the Dubai Sports City, including Abdul Rehman Bukhatir.         
	Sources in the PCB said that Pakistan was now even pushing to get back its share of the 2011 World Cup matches and wants to host them at the Dubai Sports City ground which was used for the first two one-day Internationals against Australia.         
	Bukhatir is keen to get back international cricket to Dubai and Sharjah and is willing to work out an arrangement with the PCB to achieve his ambition, one source said.         
	The source said after the ICC and the Indian board combined nearly six years ago to force Bukhatir to close down his highly successfully international cricket operations in Sharjah, Bukhatir now wants international cricket back but at the Dubai Sports City.         
	The source also said that during the first two matches against Australia, Bukhatir had left no stone unturned to bring back the glory days of Sharjah and some leading former players including Imran Khan very tactfully made statements about how viable Dubai was as an international cricket venue.         
	It remains to be seen if the ICC permits Dubai to be a World Cup venue. (PTI)

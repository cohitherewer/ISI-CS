The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Credit Squeeze has the edge
                                                                                                               Credit Squeeze has the edge
            STAR RACER                                    
	Calcutta: There are three sweepstakes races in Saturdays six-event card but all eyes will be on the 1,100m Usha Stud Calcutta Juvenile Sprint which seems to be a very open race in spite of it being only five-horse strong.          
	Trainer Bharath Singhs Galas-hiels, an easy winner of two sprints, is up against his stablemate, Credit Squeeze, who is the winner of the Calcutta Million, and Daniel Davids classic filly Cascades. It is going to be quite a race but Credit Squeezes (S. John-up) class may tell in the end.           
	Axiology and Arnatta may come good in the other sweepstakes  the 1,200m Too Hot To Touch and the 1,100m Pentagon Cup, respectively.

                  Roger Federer                     
	Melbourne: World No.2 Roger Federer reacted with surprise on Tuesday when asked what he thought about the bookmakers making British No.1 Andy Murray a favourite for next weeks Australian Open.         
	Hes the favourite? Federer asked reporters at a media conference for the invitational Kooyong Classic on Tuesday.         
	Good for him. It wont help him a whole lot, the smiling Swiss added.         
	Murray, who lost the US Open final to Federer last year, is the in-form player of the early season, having beaten Federer and world No.1 Rafael Nadal to install himself as one of the short-priced tips for Melbourne Park.         
	Federer, however, was quick to point out that being the bookmakers favourite did not necessarily translate into success.         
	Ive been in that position before and didnt make it, the 13-times Grand Slam winner added.         
	It surprises me that the bookies would say that because he hasnt won a Slam. Novak (Djokovic) won here last year. Rafa (Rafael Nadal) had an incredible season last year.         
	I won the last Slam of last season. So it is surprising to hear.         
	Federer did, however, admit that world No.4 Murray, who has a favourable 5-2 record against him after winning the Doha title last week, had improved dramatically in the past 12 months.         
	I think he has shined for a year now. He has been knocking on the door to make his move.         
	I just think he got used to playing at the highest level consistently. Earlier, he was very up and down. He has played excellent tennis. Hes a good all round player, has good tactics and has become very confident.         
	He has put himself into a winning position, but winning a Grand Slam is different. Not many guys have been able to win Grand Slams in the last few years, he added.         
	One of the reasons for that has been the Swiss himself. He has won 13 Grand Slams in last five years and had looked invincible till the Australian Open last year when Djokovic beat him to win his first Grand Slam title.         
	Federer failed to add to his tally of Grand Slam before winning the US Open, the last major of 2008.         
	He even lost his Wimbledon title to Nadal in an epic final on the Centre Court of the All England Club. While only Nadal looked to have the measure of him till 2007 end, many more players started beating Federer last year. Murray has got the better of him twice in the last one month.

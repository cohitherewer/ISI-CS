                                                     Ramesh bronze   ends drought 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Ramesh Kumar                                 
	New Delhi: Seven years ago when grappler Ramesh Kumar suffered a serious knee injury and was on the verge of quitting the game, little did he realise one day he was going to bag a world championship bronze.         
	On Thursday, Ramesh, the son of a poor farmer from village Purkhas, near Sonepat in Haryana, created history by winning Indias first World Championships medal in 42 years in Herning, Denmark.         
	So determined was the 74kg freestyle wrestler against Alexandr Burca of Moldova that he came back from a 0-3 deficit to win on the basis of technical points after the repechage round ended with the grapplers tied at 7-7 Wednesday night.         
	Ramesh had defeated Dustin Schlatter of the US 3-2 in the opening round and then overpowered Great Britains Michael Grundy 4-2. In the quarter finals, he beat Terziev of Bulgaria 7-4 before going down to Chamsulvara Chamsulvarayev of Azerbaijan in the semi-finals.         
	Aggression and determination are his biggest assets, said Naresh Dahiya, Ramesh coach for 12 years between 1993 and 2005 at the Shahbad Dairy Akhara in Delhi.         
	Rameshs coach in the Indian Railways, Rohtas Singh also echoed Dahiya. In 2002, in Manchester, Ramesh suffered a bad knee injury. Ramesh was in a bad shape and had no money for costly treatments. He approached the authorities, including the federation but none could help him at that point. So frustrated was Ramesh that he almost decided to quit wrestling.         
	Ramesh was lucky that former Union sports minister Uma Bharti came forward at that time to help the wrestler. Finally, he was treated by Mumbai doctor Anant Joshi.         
	Both Dahiya and Rohtas were unanimous in their view that Ramesh was one of the most talented wrestlers to come up in recent years. I am not saying this because he won a medal at the world meet, said Dahiya. I handled him from the age of 14 at the akhara. I always thought he was not getting his due.         
	Dahiya was not far from the truth. Son of a poor father, Ramesh earned his living by participating in dangals but won a series of international medals in the junior categories. Apart from bagging the gold in the World school wrestling meet in 1997, Ramesh won the junior Asian gold and the national championship titles for 10 years in a row.         
	He has been the best in the country for many years but the recognition was not coming, Singh said. In 2008, we all expected him to win an Olympic gold but he dropped out because of a back strain.         
	Rameshs father, Balwan Singh hasnt spoken to Ramesh in Denmark. He doesnt have a mobile phone. Till date, we had nothing. Today, Ramesh has given us everything, said Balwan.

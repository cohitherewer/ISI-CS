The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Have to start from scratch: Dhoni
                                                     Have to start from scratch: Dhoni
    - Face-Off against NZ begins with todays T20 match             A CORRESPONDENT            Dhoni                                 
	Christchurch: Mahendra Singh Dhoni refuses to bask in past glory and insists it will be a fresh start against New Zealand in the first Twenty20 International here Wednesday. At the match-eve press conference, Dhoni made it clear that his teammates would have to start all over again.               
	The following are excerpts               
	The impact weather can have         
	The temperature has been up and down, and the wind is pretty cold. A lot depends on the conditions tomorrow. If it is cloudy and there is a bit of rain, it will help the seamers. But if there is too much rain, the ball will become soggy and the batsmen will benefit. But overall, it has been cold so far.         
	Whether the clothing is adequate         
	Plenty... Every guy is carrying four to five kit bags. We are not short of clothes. But more than the clothes, its getting used to the conditions. We are taking more evening walks and going for dinner quite late when you have that air coming on to your face and when you feel it... Clothes can help but you dont want to get stuck with clothes when youre playing a game. So what minimum you have to wear or what maximum you can wear and you are comfortable with thats what is important         
	The secret of success         
	Last year we did well as a team. The important thing is that we dont rely on one or two individuals and we have been performing as a team. In most games a lot of people have been contributing. Part-timers have done the job well with the ball and we have improved as a fielding unit as well, and that helps, too.         
	If the XII for Wednesdays game has been shortlisted         
	Weve not, thats why we are not announcing the XII. Im the sort of guy who doesnt really believe in announcing the XII. People say that if you announce XII, youll have XII guys who are really focused, but I have no problem having XIV guys who are really focused.         
	Any injuries         
	No injuries till now.         
	The preparations leading up to the opener         
	The preparations have been good. Usually we practise for two/two-and-half hours. Since we have four days here we wanted to make the most out of it, especially when we are practising outdoors Maybe the next day it may rain and we wont get the same facilities, so we were practising for three-and-a-half to four hours. Well get a chance to practise at the main stadium which will be really good. As the tour progresses, youll see the players getting more and more used to the conditions.         
	If hes worried considering not many have played in New Zealand         
	Am not really worried. I believe every game is a new game. You have to start from scratch. For an individual it helps if you havent played a lot of games over here. Its a 50-day tour and the team that will be victorious will be the one that plays good cricket for a consistent amount of time.         
	If John Wrights presence could help New Zealand         
	Being an international cricketer and a coach, youll know the shortcomings, but technology is so good right now that you dont really need a coach who has been part of the team who you are playing against. You have a video analyst with you who gets the video of whatever you want whatever conditions you want to see. But from a psychological point of view, John will know the psychology of each and every Indian player. Apart from that, even if you have not coached the side, you will get the inputs. But yeah, John will help in that psychological part.         
	On the New Zealand team         
	Ive not seen a lot. New Zealand is known for the kind of cricket they play as a team. They dont really depend on one individual. Thats good for us also. We have the kind of players who can really make you win games on their own, but we are always looking for the whole team to perform. Especially for the batsmen in these conditions you can get one good ball and get out. Whatever limited opportunity he gets, if he performs, it helps the teams confidence. They have a good bunch of players. They believe in contributing, they take pride in their fielding which is important in one-day cricket. Yeah they are a good side.         
	On Indias chances in the Twenty20 match         
	Thats very difficult to say because the last time we played in Australia, were not really impressive. We didnt really perform to the extent we should. But that always happens in a Twenty20 game. We can always expect loads of fun and good cricket for the spectators because thats what a Twenty20 game is about. Its not for the bowlers or the batsmen, its for the spectators mostly and also for the fielders, who can dive around and show that extra skill. It should be good fun. Well just look to go out there and play some good cricket enjoy the conditions enjoy the moment.         
	Expectations from his players         
	They have done well with the expectation level. What we have done in the last few months is that we have diverted our attention from the expectations to the process and what we want to achieve. Expectation is set by others and can be too high to achieve. As individuals you know your potential, and you know what you can do, and accordingly you can fix. This is what I want to do in this series. What we want to focus is on the process, the practice, the plans, and if we can execute the plans when we need it in the game. That has been working for us but we have handled the expectation aspect of it as well.         
	The IPL and the forthcoming ICC World Twenty20         
	Every game is important. These are Twenty20 International games. But I think it will be important to focus on the IPL more. It wont only help us. It will help other players too who are part of the IPL, which is a big tournament. Right now these two matches against New Zealand are too far away to contribute to the Twenty20 World Cup scenario.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Roddick is in last four
                                                   Roddick is in last four
                            
	Washington: Andy Roddick needed two tie-breaks to beat big-hitting Ivo Karlovic on Friday to reach the semi-finals of the Legg Mason Classic.         
	Top seed Roddick won 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-5), with the typical scoreline for two big servers disguising the repeated service breaks.         
	Roddicks semi-final opponent will be American compatriot John Isner, who upset eighth seed Czech Tomas Berdych 6-3, 6-7 (10-12), 6-2.         
	In other quarter finals, fourth-seeded Fernando Gonzalez defeated Tommy Haas 7-5, 6-4, setting up a semi-final against second seed defending champion Juan Martin del Potro, who advanced after Robin Soderling withdrew before their match with a right elbow injury.         
	Playing in his first tournament since losing in an epic Wimbledon final, Roddick is two wins away from his fourth Washington title after overcoming the first two breaks of his serve in six career matches against the 610 Karlovic.         
	Roddick entered the match with a 4-1 record against the Croatian, who leads the ATP Tour in aces with Roddick one spot behind.         
	Their six previous sets had gone all the way to a tie-breaker, a trend that continued in this match, even with both players breaking the others serve twice.         
	After netting a volley to go down 1-3 in the first, Roddick broke back to get it to 3-4. The action moved to that inevitable tie-breaker, which the American took control of by winning the first three points.         
	In the second set, Karlovic broke in the opening game, with Roddick hitting a ball out of the stadium in frustration.         
	His composure returned and after earning his second break, Roddick lost only five more points on his serve the rest of the way, while earning a mini-break to go up 4-3 in the tie-breaker.

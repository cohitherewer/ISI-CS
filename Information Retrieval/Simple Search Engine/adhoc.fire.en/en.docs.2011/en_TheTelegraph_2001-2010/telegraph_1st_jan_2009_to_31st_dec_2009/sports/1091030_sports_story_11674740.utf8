The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arsenal win 2-1
                                                   Arsenal win 2-1
                      
	London: A young Arsenal side delighted a near capacity crowd at the Emirates Stadium with a scintillating 2-1 victory over Liverpool to secure a place in the League Cup quarter finals on Wednesday.         
	Manchester City thumped Championship (second division) Scunthorpe United 5-1 to take their place in the last eight and Chelsea saw off Bolton Wanderers 4-0 at Stamford Bridge.         
	That trio joined holders Manchester United, last years runners-up Tottenham Hotspur, Blackburn Rovers, Portsmouth and Aston Villa in an all-Premier League draw for the last eight which takes place Saturday.         
	Manager Arsene Wenger, in charge of Arsenal for the 750th time and seeking his clubs first silverware since 2005, put his faith in younger players as he usually does in this competition and they rose to the occasion with a well-deserved win.

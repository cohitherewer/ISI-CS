The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Edmilson brace does trick
                                                     Edmilson brace does trick
            A STAFF REPORTER            Edmilson after scoring one of his two goals on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: If one goes by the adage morning shows the day, then Chirag United, for sure, would displace the big duo of Mohun Bagan and East Bengal as the citys premier challenge in this editions I-League.         
	Coached by the wily Subrata Bhattacharya and consisting mainly of big club discards, the so-called minnows, Chirag registered their second victory on the trot as they humbled a hapless Mumbai FC 2-1 at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. After the completion of the second round of matches, Chirag are now second on the points table, trailing JCT on goal difference.         
	Chirag, who began on an attacking note, took the lead in the 7th minute with Edmilson scoring a beauty. Jayanta Sen fended off a host of opposition players and, after a 10-yard run, released a splitting through for Edmilson. The Brazilian sniper unleashed a diagonal grounder from the left which was beyond the reach of Amit Singha Roy.         
	Seven minutes later the hosts increased their lead and Edmilson was once again on the mark. But this time, more than the Brazilians skill, it was the Mumbai goalies poor show under the bar which resulted in the goal.         
	Joshimar caught hold of a loose ball just outside the penalty area and was about to shoot when, on second thoughts, he left it for countryman Edmilson. The Brazilians low shot had power but was certainly stoppable since it was straight towards Amit. But poor technique from the goalkeeper saw a harmless shot getting converted into a goal as the ball slipped through his arms into the net.         
	But the Mumbai side did have their chances, only to let them go because of their poor finishing. Kayne Vincent, their Asian quota import, was the culprit on more than one occasion.         
	He missed a sitter in the sixth minute when he skied a ball with only Chirag goalkeeper Sandip Nandy at his mercy. Then again in the 56th minute it was a mirror image of his earlier miss as his effort sailed over the crosspiece.         
	However, Kayne somewhat made up for his lapses when he converted a spot kick in the 65th minute to pull one back for Jameels boys. Referee Magho Singhs decision though looked a dubious one as Kinshuk Debnaths alleged push-from-behind on Abhishek Yadav appeared a legal challenge.         
	Bhattacharya said: We need to win a few more matches and take ourselves to a safe zone. Then without the fear of relegation, we will be able to put up a better show.

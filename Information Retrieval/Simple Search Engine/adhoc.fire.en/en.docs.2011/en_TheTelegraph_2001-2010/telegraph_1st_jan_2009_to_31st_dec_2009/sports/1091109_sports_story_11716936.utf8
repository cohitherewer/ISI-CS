The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Need to play big boys
                                                                                                                                     Need to play big boys
                  STICKWORK

	There is good news and there is uplifting news. The first concerns local hockey while the second was made in Canada.         
	Confirmation is received that the 114th Beighton Cup will be held on the astroturf in SAI from December 1 to 15. This is a giant leap for hockey in the state. Something that can bring interest back into local hockey.         
	The players from the state will now get to hone their skills on the appropriate surface.         
	Indeed, what with the proper turf, the games landscape itself changes. Now we can host international teams, and can organise events that showcase talent from across the world.         
	Imagine our boys producing performances like the one they did recently in Canada in the Test series, in front of home crowds.         
	The uplifting news, as you might have guessed, is the teams 6-0 thumping of Canada in the seven-match series. The hosts have a lone drawn match from which to take heart.         
	But while the team savours the high of victory, the keepers of the game in the country will do well to consider a sobering thought.         
	Canada are not exactly world beaters. Nor are they tough competitors in international hockey. Make no mistake  our boys did well. But the team will be better served by testing their mettle against the big boys of world hockey, given the daunting challenges we face next year in the hockey World Cup and the Commonwealth Games, both to be held in Delhi.         
	Being on the top of their game by next year is what the team should aim at.         
	And playing stronger opposition will give us a more balanced measure of our strengths, weaknesses, fitness and competitiveness.         
	A step forward in that direction is the new strategy of organising tournaments for both men and women at the sub-divisional and district levels as well as in the lower levels, in a six-a-side format.         
	These events are being held under the aegis of the Indian government and the Bengal Olympic Association. The programme, I am sure, will benefit the game and those who want to take it up professionally.

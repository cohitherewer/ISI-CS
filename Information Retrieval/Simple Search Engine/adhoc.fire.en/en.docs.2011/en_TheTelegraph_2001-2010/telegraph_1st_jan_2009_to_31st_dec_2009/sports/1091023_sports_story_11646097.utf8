                                                   Diego: I dont regret outburst
                      
	Buenos Aires: Argentina coach Diego Maradona has no regrets over the lewd outburst he aimed at reporters after his side sealed a dramatic victory over Uruguay last week to qualify for next years World Cup finals.         
	The former national skipper let fly with insults at some Argentine journalists in the news conference that followed the 1-0 win, prompting Fifa to launch an investigation that could lead to a fine and suspension.         
	I apologised to the ladies, not to those who talk about football on television... It was a release but I dont regret it, Maradona told the state TV station Canal 7 on Wednesday.         
	After we qualified and I said what I said, everyones offended... I said it during child protection hours, he said of outburst following what he called ill-intentioned criticism of team selection and perceived lack of tactical knowledge.         
	Argentina, who had qualified for the previous three World Cups with relative ease and not missed the finals since 1970, were in severe danger of not reaching South Africa following three defeats in a row between June and September.         
	If wed ended up out of the World Cup Id have had to go and live in Haiti... The first man to be shot would have been Diego Armando Maradona.         
	He said the reason for the many team changes  calling up more than 70 players  in his 13 matches in charge since last November were for lack of form in some cases and (tactical) indiscipline in others.         
	We got to the decisive matches (against Peru and Uruguay in October) with a lot of players from local (Argentine) teams who got us through, he said.         
	I knew Id have my revenge and so now that Im in the World Cup I say to the (journalists) you were wrong guys.         
	He said he now had the time to talk things through with leading players and Argentine Football Association president Julio Grondona.           (REUTERS)

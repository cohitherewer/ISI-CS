            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: Regal Connection and Diabolical, both are master performers in their classic years, and a cut above the rest in the seven-horse field out to contest the issue in the 2,000m Indian Champion Cup, Saturdays main attraction. Both horses have bounced back to form after training setbacks suffered last winter. The cash-rich Champion Cup provides the two multi-classic winners another opportunity to prove their mettle. However, Diabolicals past record against Regal Connection speaks for itself and the Daniel David-trained horse may prove himself again.

	Beijing: World No. 1 Dinara Safina was upset 7-5, 7-6 by local wild card Zhang Shuai in the second round of the China Open on Monday, leaving Serena Williams one victory away from reclaiming top spot in the rankings.         
	Serenas sister Venus, the world No. 3, also had a bad day, losing to Russian teenager Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova for the second week in a row, this time 3-6 ,6-1, 6-4.         
	Serena just needs to beat Ekaterina Makarova in her second round match on Tuesday to move up from No. 2 after Safina crumbled in the face of a fierce onslaught from the 226th ranked Zhang.         
	Pavlyuchenkova, the world No. 39 dominated the final two sets of the match to claim her second win over seven-times Grand Slam winner Venus after last Mondays upset in Tokyo.         
	She played really well, unfortunately sometimes I made errors too soon in the play, Williams, 29, said in a brief news conference.         
	Svetlana Kuznetsova joined her compatriot in the third round with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Spains Anabel Medina Garrigues.         
	The partisan centre court crowd later had another victory to cheer when Li Na battled past Lucie Safarova of the Czech Republic 4-6, 6-0, 6-4 to reach the third round.         
	Earlier, Novak Djokovic had shrugged off the effects of jet lag to become the first seed to reach the mens second round with an unconvincing 6-3, 7-5 victory over Victor Hanescu.

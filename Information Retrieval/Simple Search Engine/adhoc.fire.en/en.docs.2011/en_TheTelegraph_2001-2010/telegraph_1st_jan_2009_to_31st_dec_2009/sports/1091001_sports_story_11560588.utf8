    - Australia overcome Pakistan to book semis berth and seal Indias fate           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                        Sunil Gavaskar, Ravi Shrastri and Sanjay Manjrekar                                  
	Johannesburg: They werent exactly biting their nails, but the anxiety showed on the faces of the three former India cricketers doing commentary (TV, radio) at the Wanderers on Wednesday.         
	That was during the closing stages of the Australia-Pakistan Champions Trophy match, in Centurion, when Sunil Gavaskar, Ravi Shastri and Sanjay Manjrekar got together in the commentators lounge.         
	Oohs and Aahs could be heard repeatedly and there were cheers of sorts when Rana Naved-ul-Hasan bowled a maiden in the 47th over. A Pakistan win, after all, would give Team India the chance to make the semi-finals.         
	Soon enough, the runs to balls equation will come into play, Shastri remarked. Well have to get our runs in 26 overs or so, said Gavaskar with much excitement, just as the West Indies were bowled out for 129. Manjrekar was quiet.         
	Gavaskar and Shastri, incidentally, were in the teams which won the 1983 World Cup and the 1985 World Championship of Cricket. The former captains, clearly, had expected a better bottomline in South Africa.         
	Fewer words were spoken as Australia inched closer to their target (206). The tension, though, became more palpable as Umar Gul started the last over, with the world champions and holders requiring a mere four runs.         
	Australia, as it turned out, won on the last ball  courtesy a bye.         
	Team India, of course, crashed out of the tournament on the penultimate ball itself, when the scores were levelled, assuring Australia of one point at least.         
	Chalo is all that Shastri said, getting up and moving towards the commentary box. Gavaskar didnt say a word. A few seconds later, Manjrekar was overheard saying something.         
	Your team didnt play well enough... But, its also a fact that you didnt have the services of two match-winners (Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh) throughout... Made a big difference, former England cricketer Nick Knight told The Telegraph.         
	Sure they were missed, but isnt it time that multiple hands went up offering to do their job? How much longer are we going to expect others (and Pakistan, at that) to do what we should be doing on our own?

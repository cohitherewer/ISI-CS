The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Strauss is respected   by all: David Lloyd 
                                                     Strauss is respected   by all: David Lloyd 
  - Id pay and watch Sachin every day of the week, says former England Coach         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin Tendulkar                                       
	Johannesburg: Former England batsman and coach David Lloyd, now 62, spoke to The Telegraph at the Wanderers on Saturday.         
	Lloyd, a left-hander who scored an unbeaten double hundred against India during the 1974 Test series, is in South Africa on a commentary assignment.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Englands performance in the Champions Trophy         
	Oh, I didnt expect us to make the semi-final... My semi-finalists had been Australia and India (edging out Pakistan) from Group A; South Africa and Sri Lanka from Group B... Well, three of my teams didnt make it.         
	Andrew Strauss and Co. losing to Australia         
	We lost because of our batting... Despite an excellent wicket at Centurion, we didnt have enough on the board (just 257)... Look at the way Ricky Ponting and Shane Watson batted... There was nothing even close to that in our innings.         
	Strauss as captain         
	Hes good, is a fine player himself and, so, its easy for him to lead from the front... He works well with the support staff and is highly respected by all.         
	Having picked India ahead of Pakistan         
	Thats because Pakistan are slow starters and, given their history, Id thought they would be out by the time they warmed up enough... I was proved wrong and India disappointed me.         
	India having to do without Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh and Zaheer Khan         
	Yes, but England also missed players  no Andrew Flintoff and no Kevin Pietersen...         
	Whether the ongoing edition of the Champions Trophy has made the case for 50-over cricket stronger         
	(Smiles) Has neither made it stronger nor weaker... Of course, the 50 overs versus the T20 debate is going to rage... In the Sixties, the need for a shorter game was felt and the 65-over Gillette Cup was introduced... Today, in a way, were back to the Sixties... The need for T20 to grow at the expense of the ODIs is being talked about rather vigorously... Weve got to be clear about the way cricket has to evolve.         
	His choice         
	I used to be a fan of the 50-over game, but I find the middle overs quite boring... Right now, then, Id go for T20. I would be for all three forms if something is done about the middle overs... Actually, I wouldnt mind short tournaments like this Champions Trophy, where one bad day could prove costly.         
	Batsmen of the present times hed pay to watch         
	Quite a few, quite a few... Id pay and watch Sachin Tendulkar every day of the week... Ponting, who is such a class act... Pietersen, a real maverick... I love watching him... Chris Gayle, the Mr Cool... In limited overs cricket only, Id pay and watch Yuvraj, who has a presence and arrogance similar to Pietersens, and Shahid Afridi... With Afridi, though, you never know... He could be out on the first ball or score 50 off only 10!         
	Whether too much has been made of Flintoff not signing the incremental contract offered by the ECB         
	Dont think so... Everyone is wary of his fitness. I dont know when hell be fit (for ODIs, T20 Internationals).         
	Englands Ashes win this summer         
	It was great, but fresh challenges lie ahead.         
	Finally, the one England player to watch         
	Id say (21-year-old leggie) Adil Rashid.

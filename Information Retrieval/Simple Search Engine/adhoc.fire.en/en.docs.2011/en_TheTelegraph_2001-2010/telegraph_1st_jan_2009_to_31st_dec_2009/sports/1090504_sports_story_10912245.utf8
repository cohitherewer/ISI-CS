The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gillys men face an uphill task
                                                   Gillys men face an uphill task
                      
	East London: The Deccan Chargers are in for a tough contest against the Chennai Super Kings, a side high on confidence after two consecutive wins, in the Indian Premier League here Monday.         
	Adam Gilchrists men, who finished at the bottom of the table last season, surprisingly won four successive matches before hitting a rough patch with defeats in the last two matches.         
	Losses to the Delhi Daredevils and the Rajasthan Royals may not have changed the sides No.1 status on the points table, but the debacles have definitely dented the morale. In contrast, it has been a revival of sorts for Mahendra Singh Dhonis side, who defeated the Royals and the DareDevils to get their IPL campaign back on track after a rather disappointing first week for a team who were runners-up last year.         
	The key to the Chargers success has been Gilchrists rampaging form with the bat, brilliantly complemented by fellow opener Herschelle Gibbs.         
	The Chargers hold a slight edge in bowling, too, having the tournaments second highest wicket-taker R.P. Singh in their team.

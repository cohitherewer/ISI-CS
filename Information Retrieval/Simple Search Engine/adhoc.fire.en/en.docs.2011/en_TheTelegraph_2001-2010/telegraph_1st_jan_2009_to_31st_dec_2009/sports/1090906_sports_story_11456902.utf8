                                                   Air India in semi-finals
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Pune FC did Air India a huge favour when they defeated AS Douanes of Senegal 2-0 in a group D match of the IFA Shield at the Mohun Bagan ground on Saturday.         
	 Douanes, who needed to win this match to keep their hopes of a semis berth alive, are now out of the meet.         
	Izumi Arata put PFC ahead in the 30th minute when his volley from top of the penalty box crashed into the net. Jeje Lalpekhlua made it 2-0 seven minutes later when his long ranger crashed into the net leaving Douanes custodian stunned.         
	Air India will now meet Churchill Brothers in the first semi-final on Tuesday.

	Calcutta: East Bengals inconsequential I-League match against Dempo SC at the Barasat Stadium on Thursday ended inconclusively as the two teams, who share six national titles between themselves, played out a 2-2 draw.         
	The match was played in a lively pace with Yusif Yakubu putting the home team ahead in the 16th minute. The Ghanaian was at his sparkling best.         
	The first goal put Yakubus dribbling skills on display as he dodged past four Dempo defenders with a 30-yard run before slotting the ball into the net. Dempo replied through Creson Antao in the 26th minute. His header off a corner beat the red and golds custodian Subrata Paul. Two minutes later, Dempo struck again when Pauls reflexes let him down as Betos innocuous header rolled into the net.         
	Dempos laid-back attitude allowed the Calcutta giants to claw back into the match in the second half. East Bengal equalised in the 65th minute when Yakubu released Ismael Addo with a defence splitting through, which the latter converted with ease.         
	East Bengal finished sixth with this draw, garnering 28 points while Dempo finished fourth with 31 points.         
	Dempo coach Armando Colaco slammed the All India Football Federations Goal 2011 plan on Thursday, and said: Anything for the country should be supported but implementation of such a plan is impossible. It goes against the clubs interest, too.

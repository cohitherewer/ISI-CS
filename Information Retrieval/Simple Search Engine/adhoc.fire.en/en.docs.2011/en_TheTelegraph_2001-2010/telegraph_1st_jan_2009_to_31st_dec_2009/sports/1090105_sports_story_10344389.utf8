The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bangla avoid follow on
                                                   Bangla avoid follow on
                      
	Chittagong: A Mashrafe Mortaza half century helped Bangladesh avoid the follow on but Sri Lanka remained firmly on top in the second Test after dismissing the hosts for 208 runs in their first innings on Sunday.         
	The visitors stretched their 176-run first innings lead to 189, ending the second day with a second innings total of 13-0.         
	Bangladesh toiled hard to avoid batting in successive innings after losing their ninth wicket for 145 runs in reply to Sri Lankas 384 with Mortaza and Shahadat Hossain striking a defiant final wicket partnership. In the morning, the tourists added only 13 runs in four overs to the overnight 371 for six before they were all out.

	There is an element of just deserts about what has happened to the Stanford deal. If you put money ahead of principle, and ahead of a genuine love of sport, this is where it takes you.         
	Cricket is run by businessmen who think everything comes down to the bottom line. They judge their success or failure by the end-of-year accounts, because that is all businessmen understand. If you challenge them, they will point to the investment they are putting into grassroots and development. That is just a way of justifying the boardroom game they love to play: more Tests, more one-dayers, more television deals, more money. It doesnt have anything to do with the best interests of the sport.         
	The news of the fraud investigation into Sir Allen Stanfords companies shocked everyone. I feel desperately sad for the 1,200 or so people in Antigua who are likely to lose their jobs. But from the perspective of English cricket, the cancellation of any further tie-ups with Stanford is probably the best thing that could have happened. Whether he is a con man or not, everyone can surely agree that the tacky, vulgar circus that unfolded in Antigua last November was an embarrassment for the game.         
	Whether hobnobbing with the players wives, or flying into Lords in a helicopter, Stanford made his aims quite clear: he wanted to inflate his own ego, and to add another ounce of lustre to his already puffed-up reputation.         
	In England, where we tend to be suspicious of preening, a lot of his showboating fell flat. But it now seems that it was his his aura, which allowed him to build up his business empire.         
	Giles Clarke, the ECB chairman, tells us that the lawyers carried out due-diligence checks on Stanford and his companies before the deal was signed. If that is the case, we can question whether they did a very good job.         
	Here was this swaggering Texan, walking into English cricket from the other side of the Atlantic. When he started trash-talking Test cricket, saying it was boring, plenty of people found themselves asking what he was doing getting involved in the sport. And the fact that his advances had already been rejected by the Indian and the South African board should have set a few alarm bells ringing.         
	The ECB was an easy target for Stanford because it was in a hurry. The IPL was booming, and the English players were kicking up because they hadnt been allowed to go.         
	Stanford looked like a quick fix. Clarke and his sidekick, ECB chief executive David Collier, thought  wrongly, as it happened  that England would wallop the Stanford team and walk off with several million dollars over the course of the five-year deal. They thought it would keep the team sweet.         
	But it can be dangerous to go signing major deals when you are in a hurry, because it takes time to think things through clearly. And the ECB soon discovered that the sporting public was deeply uncomfortable about the match. It smacked too much of the England team prostituting themselves for money. You should never sell the England shirt for a fistful of dollars.         
	We cannot keep on treating sport as a business along the lines of Marks amp; Spencer, or Tesco. There is a sense of morality that should go with running a national team, or even a local club. And thats why I wish there were more former players working in sports administration. They would instinctively understand why the Stanford Challenge match was wrong.         
	The ECBs favourite policy is to sell cricket to the highest bidder, just as they have done with the Sky television deal. But if you put the game first, and set about providing the best possible cricket for fans to watch, you dont need to go spending millions on development. People will be drawn in for all the right reasons.         
	This fraud investigation is bound to be a messy business, and the bad publicity for English cricket will keep coming. Even so, I still believe we are all better off without Stanford, whether he is proven guilty or not.

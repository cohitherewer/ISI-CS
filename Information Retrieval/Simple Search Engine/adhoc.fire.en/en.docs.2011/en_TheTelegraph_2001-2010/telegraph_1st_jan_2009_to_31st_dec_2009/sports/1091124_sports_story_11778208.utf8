The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | At home, but not at ease

  - Manoj will lead again as Shukla isnt fully fit; Rohan Gavaskar returns       A STAFF REPORTER            Manoj Tiwary and Deep Dasgupta at the Eden on Monday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Confidence and courage comes through preparation and practice, said an unknown author. And, preparation and speculation dont go well together.         
	For Bengal, on the eve of their crucial Ranji Trophy Super League encounter against Saurashtra at the Eden from Tuesday, preparations have been outdone by the speculations.         
	A series of events, off the field, have rocked Bengals boat since the onset of the season. So, lingering doubts  over the home teams preparations  loom large ahead of the match from which at least three points are extremely necessary.         
	Monday saw an end to will Laxmi Ratan Shukla play? episode as the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) decided to rest him for the match citing his injury. But one wonders whether it was a little late.         
	Manoj Tiwary, chosen vice-captain for the season and the man in charge against Saurashtra, however didnt agree that these late selections and decisions would bear an adverse effect on the teams performance.         
	 I dont think thats an problem. I was intimated late in the last match too, but I managed to score decently. Actually, it depends on the individual how he handles the pressure, the right-handed batsman said.         
	Coming to the team, speculation rules once again. The dilemma is triggered by the return of former India captain Sourav Ganguly and Rohan Gavaskar. In accommodating the two, all-rounder Sayan Sekhar Mondal is almost certain to get the boot. But the problem is who will be the other one?         
	According to sources, it will be a choice between opener Arindam Das and middle-order batsman Avishek Jhunjhunwala. However, if Arindam turns out to be the unlucky one, it wouldnt be fair as he has done a decent job in the matches he has played so far this season.         
	With a tinge of green in the Eden pitch, Bengal will go in with three seamers with Sourav Sarkar being included in place of Shib Sagar Singh to partner Ranadeb Bose and Ashok Dinda.         
	For Saurashtra, the baton will once again be with the talented duo of Ravindra Jadeja and Cheteshwar Pujara. Pujara, who scored a comeback double century against Maharashtra this season, will hold the key in the middle order. His tenacity to play long innings makes him the most dangerous man in Saurashtras ranks.         
	Saurashtra too will bank on three seamers. Sandeep Jobanputra and Sandip Maniar will be the obvious choices though the third one is yet to be decided by the team management.         
	Ranji semi-finalists in the last two seasons, Saurashtra will also look up to coach Debu Mitra, who is familiar with conditions and had also been a Bengal coach.         
	Meanwhile, a political party has called a bandh Tuesday and the CAB has decided to assemble the Bengal team in a hotel.         
	All said and done, given Edens reputation of providing assistance to the willow-wielders, it may all boil down to the Souravs and Pujaras. Provided, of course, the off-field distractions surrounding the home team take a break!

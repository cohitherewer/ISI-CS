                                                   End of the road for Team India
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Indias title defence in the World Twenty20 ended on Sunday when they lost to England by three runs at Lords. Chasing 154 for victory, India finished on 150 for five. The visitors needed 19 off the last over but managed just 15. Mahendra Singh Dhoni (30 not out off 20 balls) and Yusuf Pathan (33 not out off 17 balls) found the going tough in the closing stages against a disciplined English attack.         
	England constantly kept the pressure on the Indians with an improved effort in the field. The hosts will now fight it out with the West Indies for a spot in the semi-finals from Group E. South Africa have already confirmed their berth in the last four.         
	India never really seemed to be in the chase after a horrible start. Gautam Gambhir and Ravindra Jadeja tried to make amends in the middle overs but the effort wasnt enough. The boundaries dried up and the singles didnt help.         
	What was most surprising was the thinktanks decision to send Suresh Raina at No.3 ahead of the in-form Yuvraj Singh. In fact, Yuvraj batted at No.5, with Jadeja coming in at No.4.         
	I think we lost in the middle overs. England used their bowlers really well. They were aggressive, conceded Dhoni.         
	We had quite a few plans for todays game but our batting failed. On a track like this 153 is not a big score.         
	Yuvraj could have come a bit earlier, but we thought if Jadeja goes in he can stabilise the innings The Yuvi, myself and Yusuf could have made it even if the asking rate was nine. But we lost wickets at crucial moments, explained the Team India captain.         
	Paul Collingwood said they got booed and that served as a motivation. There were a lot of English supporters, but we got booed at the home of cricket by the Indian fans A bit strange... So that gave us a bit of motivation. It was a fantastic performance. We really put India under a lot of pressure. We were hoping the wicket would have pace and it did we got the balls in good areas, the home captain said.         
	Earlier, accurate spin bowling from Harbhajan Singh and Jadeja pegged back England after a good start.         
	While Harbhajan took three wickets, including two off consecutive deliveries in the final over, Jadeja, playing his first match of the World Twenty20, finished with two for 26.         
	Rudra Pratap Singh, also playing his first match here, removed Luke Wright in his opening over after Dhoni had won the toss.         
	 That proved to be Indias only success in a while as Ravi Bopara (37) and Kevin Pietersen made merry. The second wicket pair added 71 runs, the 50 coming off 35 balls.         
	Englands reliance on Pietersen in the tournament has become so complete that if he fails then so does the side. Such has been the dependence that he has been forced to carry on despite admitting to a troublesome Achilles injury that could rule him out of the Ashes.         
	He didnt disappoint the Sunday crowd with 46 off 27 balls that included five boundaries and a six. His dismissal certainly cost England the momentum as he had threatened to take the match away from India.         
	Pietersen too came out trumps in his on-field rivalry with Yuvraj Singh.         
	The runs didnt come in a torrent but they came steadily enough, and there were some eye-catching strokes. Forty runs came off the six overs of Powerplay and some poor fielding on the ropes added to Indias misery.         
	But the introduction of Jadeja changed the complexion of the game. The left-arm spinner, who removed Bopara in his first over to break the flourishing partnership, struck again when he had the dangerous looking Pietersen adjudged leg before.         
	He was hoisted over mid wicket for a huge six off the previous delivery but Jadeja had the last laugh. Pietersen was trapped plumb in front going for another huge slog.         
	That was in the 13th over and England never really flourished as wickets kept tumbling at regular intervals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wolves come undone vs United
                                                                                                                       7                                        Wolves come undone vs United
  - Red Devils beat second string side to draw level on points with leaders Chelsea       [+uc('Henry Winter   THE DAILY TELEGRAPH')+]            Michael Owen (right) is challenged by Wolverhampton Wanderers George Elokobi during their Premier League match on Tuesday. (AFP)                                 
	Mick McCarthy certainly has the right name to spark a witch-hunt and stir up the conspiracy theorists. The Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Tuesday found himself at the centre of a storm after fielding 10 reserves against champions Manchester United, who duly joined Chelsea at the top of the Premier League with goals from Wayne Rooney, Nemanja Vidic and Antonio Valencia in a 3-0 win at Old Trafford.         
	United are level on 37 points with leaders Chelsea although the Blues have a better goal difference.On seeing an outfit boasting only 41 Premier League starts and frustrated by the sacrificing of any momentum built by the win over Spurs, Wolves fans inquired: Where is our first team?.         
	McCarthy was unrepentant. His team sheet was filled in with Burnley in mind. Owen Coyles side visit Molineux on Sunday and these are the type of opponents Wolves must defeat if they are to avoid relegation.         
	I can understand the fans reaction but this was my best team available because they were all fresh legs, explained McCarthy. I would hope the fans would understand what I have done. My decisions will be judged on whether we stay in the Premier League. If we stay up, everything will suddenly be OK.         
	An understanding Ferguson had warm words for McCarthys team.         
	Wolves put up a good show considering they had their second string out  which wasnt surprising considering they have to play Burnley on Sunday, said the United manager.         
	His Chelsea counterpart, Carlo Ancelotti, might be less impressed that United were granted such an easy ride by McCarthy. But McCarthy would be the last one to do United a favour in the title race.         
	But his team undoubtedly gifted the champions the opportunity to celebrate Fergusons 900th League game with a routine win. The only frustration for Ferguson was a calf injury to Vidic and confirmation of Wes Browns hamstring.         
	United took the lead on the half-hour. Dimitar Berbatov, growing in influence, won a corner and then ran in to meet Darron Gibsons kick. As the Bulgarian jumped, Wolves defenders George Elokobi and Ronald Zubar challenged. Zubar clearly handled, presenting United with a penalty which Rooney converted with ease.         
	Dead-balls were paying off for United. When Gibson then curled in another excellent corner, Vidic headed down powerfully. Hahnemann got his left hand to the ball but it squirmed over the line.         
	The force remained with United, the champions scoring a sensational third through Valencia.         
	Three points for United but only one talking point: McCarthys gamble. Wolves must beat Burnley to vindicate McCarthys decision.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

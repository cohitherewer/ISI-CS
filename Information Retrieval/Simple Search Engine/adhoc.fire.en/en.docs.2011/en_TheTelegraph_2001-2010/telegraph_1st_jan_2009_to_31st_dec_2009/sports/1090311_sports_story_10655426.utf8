                                                   Button: Its a beautiful car
                      
	London: Brawn GP may be ahead of Formula One rivals in some areas despite the teams late arrival on the scene as heirs to Honda, according to Jenson Button.         
	The Briton, whose smile said it all after he gave the new BGP001 car an impressive track debut in Barcelona on Monday, told reporters the Mercedes-powered team could yet reap the rewards of work done last year by their departed former owners.         
	The Japanese manufacturer, who announced in December that they were leaving Formula One, effectively wrote off last season early on and turned their attention instead to building a much better car for 2009.         
	This year sees the most significant change in the regulations for decades, with completely revised aerodynamics and a return to slick tyres as well as the introduction of the KERS energy recovery system.         
	While McLaren and Ferrari had to develop their new cars while simultaneously fighting for the 2008 title, Honda were able to devote most of their considerable resources to the coming championship.         
	We started development early on the 2009 car, Button said after clocking the fourth fastest time of the 10 teams in Barcelona.         
	You could say certain areas are not as good as other teams but I think weve produced a car that is competitive, the Briton added.         
	The great thing is watching everyone testing and thinking weve already tried certain parts on our car and it didnt make it that much quicker  that goes for a lot of the parts that other teams have tested.         
	We couldnt find a route with those parts. We took a different angle and its worked for us which is good, added Button, who scored just three points last year in a dismal season for Honda.         
	Its also a beautiful car, thats a difficult thing to say with these wings but this is definitely a beautiful car.           (REUTERS)

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: City golfer Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia believes that the PGTI Order of Merit, 2007-08 champion, Mukesh Kumar will give a good fight in the ongoing PGTI meet at the Tollygunge Golf club making the game more exciting.         
	Talking to journalists on Tuesday, the golfer said: I feel it will be a good competition here. So many good players are playing, and with golfers in India maturing fast, things will be pretty exciting.         
	Its good that Himmat (Singh Rai) finished five-under 65, but I feel the competition is still wide open when you have guys like Mukesh and Feroz (Ali Mollah) playing. He (Mukesh) will definitely give everybody a good fight.         
	Playing on the Tollygunge golf course after a gap of four years, the diminutive golfer said he found the grass a bit slower compared to the European courses, making things difficult .         
	I am playing after four years on this course. I found it a bit new and the green is slow compared to Europe. Today was my first day and I tried to read it I was trying to reach to my shot I hope tomorrow things will be better for me, Chowrasia said.         
	The city pro finished tied sixth at two under 68 after Round I.         
	Meanwhile, former India cricketer Ajay Jadeja, who debuted as a professional golfer on Tuesday. My first shot was behind the tree... It happens once in a lifetime to imagine a ball going off the fairway. But you have got to play from where it lies, so I had to take the penalty shot and start again, he said.

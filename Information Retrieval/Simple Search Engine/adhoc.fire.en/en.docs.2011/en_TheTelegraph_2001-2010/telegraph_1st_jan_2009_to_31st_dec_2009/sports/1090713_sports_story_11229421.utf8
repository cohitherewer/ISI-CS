The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis fresh take on captaincy
                                                   Younis fresh take on captaincy
                      
	Karachi: Failure, it seems, has revealed to Younis Khan the truth about captaincy in modern times. The Pakistan skipper conceded in an interview to a Pakistani broadcaster that the days of the captain calling all the shots in a team are long gone.         
	However much his latest views on the issue might be true, his comments amount to a volte-face since after Pakistans triumphant World T20 campaign, Younis had claimed it was the captain who called the shots and that he, much like former captain Imran Khan, was responsible for everything that had contributed to the teams success.         
	But in the interview Younis had this to say: I alone dont select the team. The coach, manager and vice-captain are also involved in the selection process and it is not just my decision. Those days, when Imran Khan as captain made all decisions, are gone. Times have changed and collective decisions must be made in a team, he said.

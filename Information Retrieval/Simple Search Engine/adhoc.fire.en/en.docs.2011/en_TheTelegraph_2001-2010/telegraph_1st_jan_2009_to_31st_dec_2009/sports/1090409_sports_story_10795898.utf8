The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Coaches allowed at SAI
                                                   Coaches allowed at SAI
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The two Korean archery coaches, who were refused accommodation at the SAI Eastern Centre, were finally accommodated at the guest house along with the 64 World Cup probables on Wednesday.         
	Chae Hong Gi (Army Sports Institute, Pune) and Lee Wong Wee (Mittal Champions Trust), who are to oversee the selection trials to name the Indian contingent for the World Cup Stage II (Porec) and III (Antalya) and second Asian GP at Tehran, were denied accommodation at the SAI Guest House.         
	The issue had snowballed into a blame game with SAI Eastern Centre claiming that it was difficult to accommodate the coaches who brought their families along.         
	The issue has been sorted out and they have been put up at the SAI Guest House, Archery Association of India secretary Paresh Nath Mukherjee said.

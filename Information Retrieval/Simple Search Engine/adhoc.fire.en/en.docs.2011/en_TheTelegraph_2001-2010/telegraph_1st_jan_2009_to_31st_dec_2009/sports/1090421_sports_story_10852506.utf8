The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indiankhana did the trick
                                                     Indian khana did the trick
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            RP Singh celebrates one of his wickets with teammate VVS Laxman in Cape Town on Sunday                           
	Durban: Rudra Pratap Singhs last India appearance in any form was six months ago. Today, the medium-pacer is determined to use the IPL as a comeback-vehicle.         
	He took a step in that direction on Sunday, at Newlands in Cape Town, by picking up the MoM award (for four for 22) there against the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	Bhaisaab, Indian khana did the trick... Id been hungry for much of Saturday, but that nights dinner at Bukhara did wonders... Made me feel good... I wont forget that meal in a hurry, Rudra Pratap, who is turning out for the Deccan Chargers, told The Telegraph.         
	Hed been one of the heroes of Indias World T20 triumph, in 2007, and is working towards making the squad for the next edition, in England, in June.         
	Rudra Pratap, who made his India debut early in the 2005-06 season, is 23. But for indifferent form and injuries, he would surely have been a regular in the India colours.         
	Incidentally, hes India captain Mahendra Singh Dhonis best buddy.

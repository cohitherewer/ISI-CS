The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Do-or-die in Bhaichungs 100th match
                                                     Do-or-die in Bhaichungs 100th match
            JAYDEEP BASU            Bhaichung Bhutia                           
	New Delhi: Defending champions India, on Sunday, must raise their game by several notches against Kyrgyzstan or face the embarrassment of being knocked out of the ONGC-Nehru Cup which is being played at the Ambedkar Stadium.         
	Especially for captain Bhaichung Bhutia, who will be playing his 100th match for the country.         
	For a team which had won almost everything that was played on this pitch in the last two years, it must be quite an unusual feeling to be threatened with an exit in the second match of the five-nation meet. But then, the defeat against Lebanon in the opener upset all calculations.         
	Bob Houghtons men need to win against Kyrgyzstan to stay in contention.         
	In Houghtons own estimate, seven points should safely put India in the final, but for that to happen, the three points against Kyrgyzstan is a must assuming Sri Lanka and Syria would provide even tougher challenges.         
	The Lebanon match has definitely put India in a spot of bother. Apart from surrendering three points, they also lost the valuable services of defenders NS Manju. Anwar Ali, too, got injured but he should be fit for Sundays match.         
	While Mahesh Gawli will take Manjus place, Deepak Mondal is expected to come in for Surkumar Singh, who has a strained thigh. Striker Sushil Singh has also twisted his leg and Sunil Chetri will pair up with Bhaichung Bhutia in the starting eleven.         
	To add to the woes, Houghton has put his team under extra pressure with his unflattering remarks against the organisers about the poor ground conditions. While the British coach has a point, his detractors must be waiting in the wings for the hosts to falter against Kyrgyzstan.         
	We arent under pressure, said Houghton. Under this situation, my boys will bring out their best.         
	Thankfully, Kyrgyzstan, in their first match against Syria, didnt look like a team that should able to pose much trouble to India. The central Asian nation has some taller players but compared to Lebanon, they lack in terms of skills and strategy.         
	History, too, back India. In 2007, faced with a similar situation, India scored a thumping 3-0 win over Kyrgyzstan at the same venue to make the Nehru Cup final.         
	The match was often described the start of Indian footballs revival as Bhaichung Bhutia, Chetri and Abhishek Yadav played some wonderful football against the visitors.         
	The fans would again be hoping for Bhutia to do more of the same although, the Indian captain was far from his usual confident self against Lebanon. We are now faced with a must win situation and should be able to give our best tomorrow, said Bhutia after the practice session.         
	Like any other football match, the midfield should decide the fate of the Saturdays crucial encounter. India have an advantage on that count as Steven Dias and NP Pradeep are doing a decent job in the middle.

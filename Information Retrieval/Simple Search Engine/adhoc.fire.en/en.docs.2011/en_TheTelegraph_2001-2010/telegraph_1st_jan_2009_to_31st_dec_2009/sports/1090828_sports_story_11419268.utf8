                                                     Kothari looks forward to World Championship
            A STAFF REPORTER            Sourav Kothari                           
	Calcutta: City cueist Sourav Kothari has been seeded fourth at the ensuing World Professional Billiards Championship that begins Wednesday at the Northern Snooker Centre, Leeds.         
	Eight-time world billiards champion Geet Sethi, seeded second, former IBSF billiards champion Pankaj Advani, former Asian champion Devendra Joshi, Dhruv Sitwala and Balachandran Bhaskar comprise the Indian contingent which will leave for Britain late on Friday night.         
	Subhash Agarwal will be the coach in place of Manoj Kothari.         
	Seventeen players from the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Scotland, besides India have been divided into five groups. While Sourav heads group B, Geet is the leader of group D.         
	Talking to The Telegraph Sourav, who lost to UKs Mike Russel in the quarter final last year at the same event, sounded upbeat.         
	According to Sourav, although there is hardly any tournament that can be considered as a warm-up event for the world meet, the just-concluded Indian selection camp in Bangalore for the Asian Indoor Games to be held in Vietnam in October, has helped him a lot.         
	This year we havent had many tournament in billiards. To be frank we had no practice and no tour at all. The camp has been the best way to prepare for the World Championship, the 24-year old said.         
	I feel good and am confident that this time I would be able to produce a good result. But billiards is a game where you need to handle pressure well. A small twist of your body can change the colour of the game. So you need to keep your cool, he said talking about his chances.         
	However, before the start of the World Championship, the Indians will play in the English Billiards Open Series (EBOS) to be held in Bradford from Tuesday         
	Asked whether he will miss father Manoj Kothari, who was the coach of the Indian contingent last year, Sourav said: Absolutely I will miss my father I have asked him to come to Leeds But he is tied u, he said.         
	Sourav will play compatriot Balachandran Bhaskar in his opening match on Wednesday.

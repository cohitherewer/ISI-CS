	Calcutta: GM Le Quang Liem of Vietnam is well-placed to win the fourth Kolkata Open Chess meet when the final round gets underway at Alekhine Chess Club, Gorky Sadan, Thursday.         
	Quang Liem, who beat GM Anton Filippov in the penultimate round Wednesday, now sits pretty on 7.5 points. He faces Indian IM S Satyapragyan Thursday and needs only a draw to seal the title.         
	Defending champion Viktor Laznica (7) of Czech Republic is half a point behind Liem. However, if Liem loses and Laznica wins, the Czech Republic player will keep the title.         
	Five others  including S. Satyapragyan, Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Sandipan Chanda of India  are close behind on 6.5 points.         
	The highlight of the days play, however, was R. R. Laxmans final GM norm with a draw against GM Rauf Mamedov of Azerbaijan. Laxman, who had earlier touched a rating of 2500, is now Indias 20th GM.         
	GM Sandipan Chanda beat the other Indian GM norm aspirant, B Adhiban to set up a last round face-off against friend and compatriot Surya, who beat GM Rustam Khusnutdinov .         
	Fourteen-year-old Sahaj Grover earned his maiden GM norm with a draw against double GM norm holder Sriram Jha. Grover has a performance score of 2607.

                                                                                                                       7                                                                                                        
	Rome: Italys former leading referee Pierluigi Collina has said he is not in favour of the use of video officials. Collina appeared to come out in favour of video evidence in an interview published in a sports daily Tuesday but later clarified his comments.     
	No matter how prepared referees are and how hard they work, they will never be able to compete with technology, Collina said. Either we understand this and accept that referees make mistakes or, and here is the provocation, we give referees the same instruments as those who judge them.        
	Madrid: Real Madrid have denied that Manchester City owner Sheik Mansour made a euro1 billion ($1.44 million) offer to buy the Spanish club. Real said on their website Tuesday that the so-called interest and the existence of any offer to acquire Real Madrid are false.         
	Rome: Luca Toni said Tuesday he is more than convinced that he will join AS Roma from Bayern Munich in the January transfer window. Earlier in the month Munich president Uli Hoeness said Toni could leave on a free transfer.        
	Madrid: Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas played down speculation that his future lies outside the Premier League as he works to overcome a hamstring injury. Fabregas said his focus is recovering from the injury and not the constant reports linking him with Barcelona and Real Madrid.        
	New Delhi: The Nehru Stadium, one of the main venues for the 2010 Commonwealth Games which is way behind its construction schedule, may be ready by May next year with organisers deploying more engineers to complete the work within the revised timeframe, Union sports minister M.S. Gill said Tuesday.        
	Frankfurt: Ralf Schumacher says he would follow his older brother Michaels return to Formula One racing if he receives a good offer. Ralf, who retired from F1 in 2007, said Tuesday that he would seriously consider an offer to drive for a competitive team. The 34-year-old drivers last team was Toyota.           
	Johannesburg: Graeme Smith as skipper has been of no good to South Africa and Johan Botha would make a better leader, feels former captain Clive Rice.     
	What has he (Smith) actually achieved as captain? For me, he is too one-dimensional as captain and he shows no enterprising spirit, Rice said. Botha really impressed me as captain when he led South Africa to a victory against Australia in a one-day series.

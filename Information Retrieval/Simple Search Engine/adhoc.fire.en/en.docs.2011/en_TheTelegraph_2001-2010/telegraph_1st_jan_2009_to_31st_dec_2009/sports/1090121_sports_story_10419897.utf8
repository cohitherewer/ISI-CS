The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India take 2-0 lead
                                                   India take 2-0 lead
                      
	Mar del Plata: India registered their second successive win, defeating Argentina 3-2 in a keenly-contested second hockey Test at the Estadio Panamericano here Tuesday to take a 2-0 lead in the four-match series.         
	India, who made a comeback to international hockey after almost a year, had beaten Argentina 2-0 in the first Test on Monday.         
	Centre-forward Shivendra Singh (12th minute), Prabhjot Singh (40th) and captain Sandeep Singh (59th) scored the goals for the visitors while Mario Almada (13th) and Pedro Ibarra (46th) found the net for Argentina.         
	Eight-time Olympic champions India started from where they left Monday and launched a flurry of attacks on the Argentine goal from the word go. The Indian forward line of Prabhjot, last matchs goal-scorer Deepak Thakur and Shivendra continuously unnerved the experienced Argentine defence with frequent raids.

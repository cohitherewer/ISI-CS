The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | McCullum stands tall to deny India
                                                     McCullum stands tall to deny India
    - India lose series 0-2 after yet another batting failure                   Substitute Rohit Sharma drops Brendon McCullum (not in picture) off the last ball of the match in Wellington on Friday. (AFP)                           
	Wellington: New Zealand Friday earned a dramatic last-ball victory against India in the second Twenty20 International to clinch the series 2-0.         
	New Zealands Brendon McCullum turned out to be the hero eclipsing Irfan Pathan in the last three balls of the match. Chasing a modest 150 to win, the hosts were cruising along comfortably before Irfan changed the complexion of the game with a double strike in the 18th over.         
	Needing 12 runs off the last over of the match, bowled by Irfan, Brendon hit two boundaries off the last three balls to level the scores and then scampered through for a single to earn the win. The result of the battle at the Westpac Stadium could have been different had substitute fielder Rohit Sharma latched on to a difficult catch off Brendon off the last ball, which would have carried the game to the Super Over.         
	Put into bat, Indias formidable batting failed to click for the second time on the trot, leaving New Zealand with a fairly simple task of scoring 7.50 runs per over. Only Yuvraj Singh hit 50 off 34 balls. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Virender Sehwag were the other notable contributors.         
	The New Zealand run chase began with a flourish with Brendon and Jesse Ryder putting on a brisk 53-run partnership. Ryder hoicked Irfan for a six off the very first ball and then hit Zaheer Khan for two fours in the next over as he played a cameo off 15 balls before being dismissed by Zaheer.         
	Indians were lucky to pick up the second wicket when home umpire Gary Baxter adjudged the dangerous Martin Guptill leg before off Harbhajan Singh despite a big inside edge. Guptill went for a pull, missed and the Indians appealed furiously. Baxter had a long look at it and surprised everyone by raising his finger.         
	Ravindra Jadeja, who replaced Rohit Sharma in the side, bowled in tandem with Harbhajan to put the brakes on scoring. With the spinners drying up the runs, the game gradually tilted towards India after Irfans twin blows left the home team with a difficult task of scoring 23 runs from the last two overs.         
	Pathan dismissed Taylor and Jacob Oram off consecutive balls at the start of the 18th over, setting up an exciting climax to the match. Yuvraj Singh bowled the penultimate over and the slow left-armer dismissed Neil Broom but gave away 11 runs. Pathan then did extremely well by giving away just three runs in the first three balls but McCullum hit him for two consecutive fours to level the scores.         
	In the Indian innings, as in the first T20 at Christchurch the Indian top order collapsed like a pack of cards.         
	Virender Sehwag was at his belligerent best, savaging Tim Southee and Iain Brien at will. But he chanced his arms too often and offered a simple catch to Vettori at mid-off. When Suresh Raina and Gautam Gambhir fell in quick succession, India were in deep trouble at 47 for three.         
	Yuvraj was sedate at the start, but once he got his eye in, he went hammer and tongs, smashing Daniel Vettori for successive sixes. The southpaw brought up his fourth half century in T20 cricket with a towering six off Brien. But the exuberant left-hander perished off the next ball.

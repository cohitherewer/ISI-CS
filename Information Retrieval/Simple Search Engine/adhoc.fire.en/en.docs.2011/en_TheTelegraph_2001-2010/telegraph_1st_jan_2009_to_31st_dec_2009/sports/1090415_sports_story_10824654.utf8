The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Captaincy card is still held tight
                                                     Captaincy card is still held tight
    - Collective leadership has worked: Buchanan             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Buchanan                                 
	Calcutta: The last of the Kolkata Knight Riders warm-up matches ended late on Tuesday, with cricket manager John Buchanan very happy at how his collective leadership concept had worked over the past week.         
	His mantra: One captain, but multiple leaders on the field and in the dressing room.         
	Indeed, Im very happy Im feeling good about the whole thing The players are now aware about how it works, Buchanan told The Telegraph, around midnight (IST), from Bloemfontein.         
	Asked if there still were areas which needed to be fine-tuned, he replied: Dont think so The communication within has been clear and, obviously, thats cause for satisfaction         
	Buchanan said that a full-time captain would be appointed for the IPLs second edition, from April 18, but declined to name him.         
	Look, we may not make an announcement till our first match (against the Deccan Chargers, on April 19) Id say one from among Sourav (Ganguly), Brendon McCullum, (Brad) Hodge and Chris Gayle would be the captain Thats all from me at this stage.         
	The chuckle couldnt be missed.         
	Buchanan confirmed that the captaincy issue would be discussed with principal owner Shah Rukh Khan, when they meet in Cape Town.         
	Sourav, who was indisposed on Tuesday, captained the Knight Riders in the inaugural season. However, McCullum has emerged as a very strong contender.         
	In fact, right now, Sourav has reason to lose some sleep.         
	Clearly, McCullum (the New Zealand vice-captain) is set to serve the Knight Riders for much longer than Sourav, the franchises icon-player, whose position will be reviewed in 2010, at the end of three years.         
	Buchanans tone suggested he wasnt at all worried about the captaincy issue, but definitely concerned about the knee injury to the in-form Cheteshwar Pujara.         
	Pujaras going for an MRI Lets see what the report reveals At this stage, we arent sure about (Wriddhiman) Saha either, he signed off.         
	The Knight Riders move out of Bloemfontein on Wednesday afternoon.         
	Incidentally, co-owner Jay Mehta is understood to have watched the last two warm-up matches.

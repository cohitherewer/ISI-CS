                                                   Twenty20 tie too added to itinerary
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and New Zealand Cricket announced an extended schedule for Indias tour of New Zealand, which will now include an additional Test match and a second Twenty20 International, according to information forwarded by the BCCI Thursday.         
	The Indian team will reach New Zealand on February 20, eight days earlier than originally scheduled, with the first tour match being an additional Twenty20 match in Christchurch on February 25. Napier will host the additional Test, which will be part of a three-match Test Series.         
	N. Srinivasan, honorary secretary of the BCCI, said he was delighted that the two national bodies had been able to agree on an extended tour.         
	My thanks go to New Zealand Cricket for responding so positively to our request for an extended Test series, he said. There have been a number of issues for both boards to resolve to accommodate the new schedule and I am pleased we have been able to work together to achieve a high quality programme. To have such a strong mix of Tests, one-day Internationals and Twenty20s will be good for both teams, and for cricket followers in India and New Zealand.         
	Justin Vaughan, chief executive officer of NZC, said the opportunity for an extended tour by India was great for the game in New Zealand.         
	India is probably the most exciting side in the world at present, packed with superstars, and the chance to see six more days of high quality international competition will be welcomed by all New Zealand cricket fans, he said.

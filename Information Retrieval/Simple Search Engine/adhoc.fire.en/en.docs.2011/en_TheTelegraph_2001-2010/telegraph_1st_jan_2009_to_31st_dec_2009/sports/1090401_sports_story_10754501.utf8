The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pros are playing with   health
                                                   Pros are playing with   health

	Of the 104 players dope-tested at Euro 2008, 42 per cent revealed to Uefa doctors that they had taken non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the previous three months. Recent research suggests NSAIDs can lead to heart and kidney problems.         
	England were not even present at Euro 2008 but it is known that many of Fabio Capellos players take anti-inflammatory pills while the captain, John Terry, openly admits to requiring injections at times simply to start a match.         
	Such is the quality of medical care afforded by stars such as Terry  and Chelsea and England have outstanding staffs  that the widespread consumption of anti-inflammatory drugs should not lead to hysterical headlines, but legitimate fears persist.         
	Terry could end up in a wheelchair while even those of his teammates taking NSAIDs must be made aware of the side-effect risks, according to Uefa.         
	Footballers have always risked long-term pain for short-term gain, pushing their bodies to the brink and beyond. The sight of a Seventies legend hobbling into a commentary box, his knees shot by too many cortisone injections, is a staple of modern match-day life.         
	In the five months leading up to Euro 2008, Uefa granted permission for 16 of the 368 players due to play in the tournament to receive cortisone injections, while eight more were injected during the June tournament itself.         
	Those numbers are manageable, greatly reduced from the Seventies and Eighties, as players begin to appreciate the dangers. NSAIDs are now the main concern because of the numbers of players taking pills.         
	Uefa admits that treatment of musculo-skeletal problems with NSAIDs is very common among top-level football players in Europe. The highly-respected vice-chairman of Uefas medical committee, Professor Jan Ekstrand, whose research into Euro 2008 has just been published, now calls for a debate in light of the recently-described heart and kidney problems related to frequent use of NSAIDs.         
	As England were not at Euro 2008, they have yet to receive Ekstrands report. Capellos medical team, Dr Ian Beasley and Gary Lewin, are looking forward to getting a copy and considering its findings, although both are aware of talk generally within the medical world about the possible dangers of NSAIDs.         
	Ekstrand invariably talks sense. In the past, he has conducted research that discovered Premier League footballers are five times more likely to suffer an injury in the later stages of the season (like David Beckham and Wayne Rooney before the World Cups of 2002 and 2006, respectively) than counterparts in countries who do have a winter break.         
	The impact on players bodies of not pausing for breath in January was confirmed by Sir Alex Ferguson with anecdotal evidence about his Manchester United players.         
	Having ignored Ekstrands cautionary tale about the damage done by no winter break, English football must heed his warnings about NSAIDs. No player should deliberately be put at risk of heart or kidney failure.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Burnley hold City
                                                                                                                                   Burnley hold City
                      
	London: Manchester City was held to a fifth consecutive draw in the Premier League on Saturday after finishing up 3-3 with Burnley and handing fourth place to Tottenham, which beat Sunderland 2-0.         
	City had fought back from being two goals down to lead Burnley 3-2, but Kevin McDonalds late strike earned Burnley its first point on the road.         
	Tottenham rebounded from back-to-back losses to beat Sunderland with Robbie Keane and Tom Huddlestone providing the goals and former striker Darren Bent missing a penalty for the visitors.         
	As City slipped to sixth place, Aston Villa moved up to fifth by routing Bolton 5-1, while Blackburn moved out of the relegation zone with a 3-1 victory over bottom-place Portsmouth.         
	City has not won since September and the draw with Burnley comes before a visit next week to Abu Dhabi to meet the clubs owner Sheikh Mansour, who has lavished around 200 million on the squad since last season.

                                                   Pawar questions BCCI move
  - IMG reserves the right to move court       A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                            
	Calcutta/Mumbai: In what is bound to be an embarrassment for the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Shashank Manohar and secretary N. Srinivasan, former chief Sharad Pawar has questioned the Boards decision to terminate the International Management Group (IMG)s services for the IPL and warned that the unilateral move would put the BCCI and its stakeholders investments in jeopardy.         
	Pawar wrote a letter to Manohar in his capacity as president of the Mumbai Cricket Association and expressed his views. I am very disturbed to hear about the termination of IMG contract by the honorary secretary, BCCI, Pawar wrote in his letter. Reading the contents of the termination, I feel that this unilateral move by the BCCI will put the BCCI in jeopardy. Not only will this lead to a prolonged legal battle but it will also show us in bad light in public.         
	Pawar said the 10-year contract with IMG, which he said was an integral part of IPL, was approved at all appropriate levels during his tenure as board president till September 2008. I always believed that the Board believes in continuity and undoing what was done consciously and in the best interests of Indian cricket is neither desirable nor appropriate, Pawar wrote.         
	After season one of the IPL and its tremendous success, the IPL revenues went up beyond our expectations and as a result the payout to IMG was going to be quite large. We all had at that time agreed to renegotiate the contract with IMG as a result of this tremendous success, he said.         
	Pawars concerns have been echoed by Sony, the IPLs broadcasters, which said in a separate letter that the timing of the decision was awkward for them and would have far-reaching implications on the next season.         
	Meanwhile, the IMG has asked the Board to reconsider its position on the terminated contract.         
	Andrew Wildblood, IMGs senior vice-president, in his reply to the BCCI secretary N. Srinivasans termination notice sent a few days ago, has stated that the Board had not provided any grounds for such termination, and there are no such grounds, according to available information.         
	Wildblood, who is based in London, has also issued a veiled threat asking the BCCI to reconsider its position even as the sports management firm reserved its rights and remedies at law under and in respect of the contract.         
	This letter from the IMG is expected to be taken up for discussion at the governing council meeting of the IPL which is expected to finalise the accounts for the 2009 edition held in South Africa.         
	Wildbloods letter was in response to a letter sent by Srinivasan to IMG where he had clearly spelt that the BCCI had taken a decision not to use IMGs services any more for the conduct of the cash-awash IPL.         
	The Board secretary stated in his letter to IMG that the BCCI working committee did not approve of the terms he had negotiated with Wildblood by which IMG was paid Rs 42.92 crore for services rendered in the first edition of IPL in 2008.         
	Srinivasan also said in his letter to Wildblood that while the negotiations were pending, IMGs services were utilised when this years IPL was moved out of India to South Africa because of general elections.         
	The BCCI secretary said the working committee felt that the amount asked by the sports management firm was disproportionate, following which further negotiations took place in London among Srinivasan, the BCCI president Shashank Manohar and Wildblood in June.         
	Stating that Wildblood was asked to submit a new proposal before the Boards next working committee meeting which the latter failed to do, Srinivasan said in his letter that IMGs services were no longer needed.         
	But the Board secretarys version of the happenings have been disputed by Wildblood, who recalled that at the IPLs governing council meeting in Bangkok in October, 2008, Srinivasan had acknowledged the validity of IMGs ten-year contract signed in September, 2007.         
	Wildblood pointed out that after the IMG had agreed to an annual commission proposed by the BCCI, instead of the earlier fixed fee for services rendered, the Boards working committee shot it down.         
	He said that at a meeting with Manohar and Srinivasan in July he told them the IMG was not prepared to submit a revised proposal as suggested by them in London.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Easy victory for Chelsea 
                                                   Easy victory for Chelsea 
                      
	London: Frank Lampard scored twice Saturday to lead Chelsea to a record 5-0 win over Blackburn and first place in the Premier League.         
	Chelsea dominated throughout and led at halftime through an own-goal by Gael Givet, before four second-half goals at Stamford Bridge sealed their biggest ever win in 102 years of games against Rovers.         
	Lampard scored with a firm shot, Michael Essien scored from about 35 meters (yards), Lampard hit a penalty and Didier Drogba headed in all by the 64th minute. Chelsea now lead by two points from defending champions Manchester United, who could retake top spot if it wins at fierce rival Liverpool in one of Sundays four matches.         
	Meanwhile, Tottenham Hotspurs bid to break up the Premier Leagues big-four cartel suffered a hefty setback when they lost 1-0 at home to Stoke City courtesy of an 86th-minute goal by Glenn Whelan.         
	A Spurs win would have taken them provisionally level on points with leaders Manchester United but after failing to turn their dominance into a goal they were caught on the break as Stoke claimed their first away win of the season.         
	Burnleys 100 percent home record ended with a 3-1 defeat by Wigan Athletic and Sunderlands good run was halted by a 2-1 loss at Birmingham City. Wolverhampton Wanderers and Aston Villa drew 1-1 at Molineux while Hull City and visiting Portsmouth showed why they are in the bottom three with a dire goalless draw.         
	Tottenham were reduced to 10 men for the last 12 minutes when Aaron Lennon went off injured with all the substitutes used and Stoke took advantage when Ricardo Fuller stormed down the wing and squared for Whelan to score with a superb curler.

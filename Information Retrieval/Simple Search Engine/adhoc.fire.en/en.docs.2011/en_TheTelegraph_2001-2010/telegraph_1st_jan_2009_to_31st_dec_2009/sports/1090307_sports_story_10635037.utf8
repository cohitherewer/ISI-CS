            A STAFF REPORTER            Mohammedan Sportings Eugene Gray on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Victory will be the sole objective of Mohammedan Sporting when they clash with United SC in a crucial match of the I-league on Saturday.         
	Mohammedan Sporting are tottering at the 11th spot, with 15 points from 17 matches, and unless they manage to win this match at the Barasat Stadium, it will be tough for them to beat the drop.         
	We will have to win this match. And even after that it wont be rosy as we have some difficult matches coming up, said Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali. The coach informed that defender Wasim Feroze will be sitting out with a double booking.         
	Despite the limitations, Shabbir is drawing solace from the fact that his boys have been playing well in the second phase. Mohammedan Sporting have performed quite encouragingly in the last few matches. They beat JCT 2-1 in Ludhiana, were unfortunate to lose 0-1 against Mohun Bagan and held Mahindra United (0-0) and East Bengal (2-2) in their last two matches.         
	United SC, of late, have also belted out some dogged performances. They downed Air India and JCT before snatching a point from league leaders Sporting Clube de Goa.         
	Coach Subrata Bhattacharya is slightly better off as his team were in eighth spot with 20 points.         
	Agrees Shabbir: United are a better side and have been playing well. They will surely make our life miserable.         
	Mohammedan Sporting will once again hope that their skipper Mike Okoro gets his name on the scoresheet. Okoro and Suroj Mondal have posed quite a few problems for their rivals and the United defence will have to be cautious against them. Okoros battle with Daniel will be interesting on Saturday.         
	In the other match on Saturday, Mumbais Air India face JCT in Ludhiana.

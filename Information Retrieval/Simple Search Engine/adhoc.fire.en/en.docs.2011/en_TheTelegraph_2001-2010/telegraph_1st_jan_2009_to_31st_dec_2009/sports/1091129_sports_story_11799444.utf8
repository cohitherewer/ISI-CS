     NARESH KUMAR                                            Andre Agassi       
	The bottom has fallen out of the Andre Agassi kaleidoscope. The colours are gone; only darkness remains. The doe-eyed global seducer, who wooed fans with flying kisses and folded hands, has confessed in his autobiography that he used the illegal drug crystal meth on several occasions in 1997.         
	Agassi describes his experience after snorting the drug, stating: There is a moment of regret, followed by vast sadness. Then comes a tidal wave of euphoria that sweeps away every negative thought in my head. Ive never felt so alive, so hopeful  and I never felt such energy.         
	This happened, Agassi says, in 1997 when he had plummeted to 124 in the rankings. Agassi shot up to No.6 next year, and went on to win the French Open in 1999, which was a spectacular victory. With a total of eight Grand Slam titles, Agassi became the fifth man after Fred Perry, Donald Budge, Rod Laver and Roy Emerson to win all the four Grand Slam titles.         
	Agassis unmatched charisma made him the most widely marketed player of all time. The elite cognoscenti admired his great talent and timing as he powered his way to the top by hitting an early ball to smother the top-spin, which dominates the game today.         
	The hip-hops and the likes, syncopated with his behaviour and outrageous attire. Fluorescent clothes, wigged hairdo, denim shorts and earrings won their hearts.         
	He baffled Philippe Chatrier, president of the French Association, by calling him a Bozo  whatever that means. Agassis charisma and behaviour swept across the board and captivated all levels of society.         
	Borg was the only other player who had such a following and enjoyed cult status. Somdev, our guitar-strumming hopeful, probably echoes the US collegiate adoration by saying. Agassi is a class act. How does one judge Agassi now, after his confession?         
	The outspoken Russian Marat Safin, a former No.1 in the world, has said that Agassi should return the prize money and be stripped of the titles he has won. Federer and Nadal have condemned Agassis drug taking but have not suggested strong punitive action. There has been no volcanic outburst in the tennis world.         
	I was inclined to view Agassis transgression lightly, but after giving the matter some thought, found that it was a very serious matter. What struck me first was that Krishnan and Vijay Amritraj on drugs, may well have won a major if one is to believe Agassis assertion in his book that crystal meth makes you feel like Superman, dude.         
	It is crystal clear that there was no effective or proper system to detect drug abuse and to punish offenders. Agassi said that he took crystal meth on multiple occasions in 1997.         
	After 97 came, as succinctly put by the New York Times, the longest period of sustained excellence of his career. In 1999, he won the French Open after losing the first two sets 1-6, 2-6 against Andrei Medvedev. In the final of Wimbledon, he lost to Pete Sampras, and then went on to beat Todd Martin in five sets to win the US Open. It was a terrific year for him.         
	In 2000, when Agassi was 30 years old, the purple patch continued as he won the French Open for the second time. It was his sixth Grand Slam title. French Open is the toughest test of stamina in tennis.         
	Even Sampras could not win it. Federer managed to scrape through in 2009, in the absence of Nadal. Agassi continued his amazing run and won the US Open in 2001 and 2003, when he was 33 years of age!         
	Can you imagine Federer, with the smoothest game of all time, unequalled discipline and dedication, still playing at 33 years and winning Grand Slams in 2014?         
	It seems impossible. Doubters will label Agassis four-year period of sustained excellence as a run, which might have been drug-fuelled.         
	Having cleared his conscience, Agassi is sitting comfortably as any action against him is time-barred. 1998 onwards, when he had his unbelievable run, the Association for Tennis Professionals (ATP) presumably found him drug free and therefore, any allegations do not carry any weight whatsoever.         
	All the players were monitored by the same system, flawed or otherwise. How can any action be taken against Agassi now, specially if no charges were made?         
	So in what slot will history put Agassi? From those tennis players who lost close matches to him in his Superman spell after 1997, the reaction is understandably violent. For the high society, a snort or two may well have been considered recreational, and dismissed. For others, like Somdev put it, Agassi is a class act.         
	Agassi, the 21st century Robin Hood, has his heart in the right place.         
	One must not forget that Agassi raised more than $52.3 million to help at-risk and disadvantaged youth in Las Vegas, through his charitable foundations.         
	For me, he was a supremely gifted player of whom Sampras said: When Andres on, forget it.         
	He is one who lived life to the hilt, a fascinating high-wire trapeze artist, unique in the history of tennis.

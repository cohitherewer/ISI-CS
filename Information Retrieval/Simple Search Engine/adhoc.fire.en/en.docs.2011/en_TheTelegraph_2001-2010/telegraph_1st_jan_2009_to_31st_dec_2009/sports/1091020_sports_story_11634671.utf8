The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev ends tied 62nd 
                                                   Jeev ends tied 62nd 
                      
	Las Vegas: A late slump marred Jeev Milkha Singhs card and he turned in an even-par 71 in the final round to sign off tied 62nd in the Justin Timberlake Shriners Hospitals for Children Open golf tournament here.         
	The seasoned pro ended his campaign with a total of six-under 278 on Sunday.         
	A 10th tee starter, Jeev stumbled to a bogey on the 11th hole before hitting a purple patch to reel off a birdie hattrick from the 14th to 16th holes.         
	A bogey-birdie finish to the back-nine left him two-under at the turn and he made it three-under by gaining a shot on the first hole.         
	But things went haywire from there as he stumbled to a double-bogey on the fifth hole before dropping another stroke on the ninth to end the day rather disappointingly.         
	Indian-born Swede Daniel Chopra finished a couple of strokes ahead of Jeev at tied 47th after returning a fine five-under 66 which included five birdies and an eagle against a couple of bogeys.         
	At the top, Scot Martin Laird (68) clinched the title after beating the American duo of Chad Campbell (69) and George McNeill (67) in a play-off.         
	The trio was for the top spot tied with totals of 19-under 265 after regulation play.           (PTI)

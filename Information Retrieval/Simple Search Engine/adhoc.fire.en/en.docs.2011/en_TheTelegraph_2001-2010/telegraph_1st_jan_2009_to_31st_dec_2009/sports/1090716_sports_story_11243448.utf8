The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England will miss Flintoff: Sourav
                                                   England will miss Flintoff: Sourav
                      
	London: Sourav Ganguly feels England could have prolonged Andrew Flintoffs Test career by balancing his batting and bowling. The former India captain added that frail physique, and not excessive cricket, was the reason behind the all-rounders injury woes.         
	I always said England needed to balance his bowling with his batting if they wanted him to survive for longer in Test cricket, Sourav said.         
	Hes a big boy and injuries are part and parcel of sport, but there are other fast bowlers around the world who are running in and playing and doing well in Test matches.         
	I think its more about Freddies body than the rigours of international cricket, Sourav was quoted as saying by an English daily.         
	Sourav didnt share the best of relationships with Flintoff during their days together at Lancashire and it worsened in 2002 when Flintoffs shirt-swirling antics in Mumbai infuriated the Indian.         
	However, he was effusive in his praise for Flintoff and described the England player as his teams best bowler.         
	Its a big loss for England... With England, every time they are under pressure it is Freddie with the ball because he is their best bowler, he said. (PTI)

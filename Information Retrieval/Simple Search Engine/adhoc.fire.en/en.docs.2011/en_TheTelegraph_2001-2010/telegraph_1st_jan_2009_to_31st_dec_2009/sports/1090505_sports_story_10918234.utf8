The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Promoting myself paid off: Dhoni
                                                   Promoting myself paid off: Dhoni
            OUR BUREAU                      
	The Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said his crucial innings of 58 not out, which earned him the Man of the Match award on Monday, was possible because he promoted himself in the batting order.         
	I cant hit the ball from the word go. I need time to settle down and then I can play those big shots. So I decided to promote myself in the batting order in this match and that paid off, Dhoni said.         
	The Super Kings thumped the Deccan Chargers by 78 runs to move to the top of the points table in the Indian Premier League. Murali Vijay and (Matthew) Hayden gave us a solid start today (Monday) and we were able to capitalise on that. With a good score at the end of the first 10 overs, we knew that we would be able to finish on a high score, the wicketkeeper batsman said.         
	Dhoni also lavished praise on his bowlers for providing a brilliant start. The Chargers were reduced to one for three wickets by the third over.         
	Early wickets are extremely necessary to take away the game from the opposition. The wickets of (Adam) Gilchrist and (Herschelle) Gibbs early on provided us with the advantage, he explained.         
	But the India captain admitted that his side needed to improve their fielding. We have dropped catches from the very beginning of the IPL. We need to work hard on that. It can turn out to be a crucial factor on days when we fail to put up a good score on the board, said Dhoni.         
	He added: Three wins on the trot is quite impressive. Our bowlers and batsmen are doing their job well. But the tournament gets tougher with each passing day and so we need to continue to perform our best.         
	Losing captain Gilchrist admitted that they were simply outsmarted by the Super Kings. We were outplayed in all the departments of the game. It was a good batting surface. We didnt bowl badly, but they batted superbly, he said.         
	But he chose to remain positive in spite of the fact that the Chargers, who had started the tournament brilliantly, have succumbed to their third loss on the trot. Its just half way and we have won more matches than we have lost. So its not all that bad, he said.

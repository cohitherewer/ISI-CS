The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Liverpool are not willing to sign Tevez
                                                   Liverpool are not willing to sign Tevez
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Liverpool manager Rafa Benitezs unwillingness to meet the 25.5 million asking price for Manchester Uniteds Carlos Tevez has allowed Manchester City to move ahead in the race to sign the Argentine, while Chelsea and Real Madrid are also interested parties.         
	Tevezs representatives will meet United chief executive David Gill Wednesday to discuss the forwards future, though privately Tevez holds out little hope of United coming to an agreement that would see him remain at Old Trafford beyond the end of the month.         
	United, who have already paid around 10 million in fees during the players two year loan at the club, have been trying to negotiate a reduced fee for the player, but with City more than willing to pay the asking price, that appears unlikely to bear fruit.         
	City would also be able to offer Tevez vastly inflated wages and the Argentines sense of frustration with United, with whose fans he enjoys an excellent relationship, may make the controversial move across the city more feasible.         
	Real and Chelsea remain in contention but the London clubs pursuit of other high profile attacking options, such as AC Milan playmaker Kaka, means Tevezs chances of being a regular starter at Stamford Bridge, a key consideration after being relegated to the Old Trafford bench for much of the season, appear limited.

	London: England women, on Sunday, scripted history by winning a World Cup double after their comprehensive six-wicket victory over New Zealand in the inaugural World Twenty20 final here.         
	England, who had won the ODI World Cup in Australia in March, produced a clinical performance against the Black Caps at the historic Lords to hold world titles for the two short formats of the game.         
	The home team first skittled New Zealand out for a paltry 85, thanks mainly to right-arm fast bowler Katherine Hunts three for six from four overs, and then chased down the target in 17 overs, reaching 86 for four.         
	Englands in-form batter Claire Taylor top-scored with an unbeaten 39 off 32 balls while wicketkeeper Sarah Taylor chipped in with 23.         
	For New Zealand, Sophie Devine, Sian Ruck, Kate Pulford and Nicola Browne took a wicket apiece.         
	England, who were always in control of the match, made a decent start before opener and captain Charlotte Edwards fell for nine in the fourth over at the team score of 19.         
	Edwards was looking in great touch hitting two fours off Sian Ruck though the New Zealand left-arm seamer had the last laugh uprooting the England captains stumps with an inswinger.         
	The other opener Sarah Taylor was not bothered by her captains dismissal and hit a couple of fours off Kate Pulford in the seventh over to steady the England innings.         
	Taylor though fell to Pulford, nicking to Rachel Priest two overs later for 23 off 33 balls, which included three fours.         
	The asking rate rose to 4.5 after the 10th over but with eight wickets in hand and Claire Taylor at the crease England were in a comfortable position.         
	Taylor opened up after the halfway mark and hit a flurry of boundaries to ease the pressure.         
	She shared a 31-run stand for the third wicket from 33 balls with Beth Morgan (6) and took England to victory in style with a four off Browne.         
	Earlier, Katherine Brunt produced a devastating spell of fast bowling to rip through the top order as New Zealand were bundled out for a paltry 85.         
	Brunt ran through the New Zealand top order in her four-over spell, including the prize scalp of White Ferns captain and tournament leading run scorer Aimee Watkins (2).         
	In a match which is the repeat of the ODI World Cup final in Australia in March which England won, four of the New Zealand top batters were back in the dug out by the eighth over for just 23.         
	Nicki Shaw and Jenny Gunn contributed two wickets apiece for England while Amy Satterthwaite top-scored for New Zealand with 19 off 42 balls.         
	New Zealand never recovered from the early jolts and were precariously placed at 30 for four at the halfway mark.         
	Put in to bat, New Zealand had the worst start possible with their star opening batswoman Suzie Bats out in the first over for just one to Laura Marsh at team score of two.         
	Three overs later, Watkins stumps went cartwheeling after being beaten by a Brunt inswinger, and with it New Zealand were in trouble with their two best batswomen back to the dug out for just 18 runs on the board.         
	Runs came in trickle with just two fours in the first six overs as New Zealand batswomen grafted for runs before Lucy Doolan became Brunts second wicket caught behind stumps by Sarah Taylor in the eighth over for a 14 off 19 balls.         
	Three balls later, Priest fell caught and bowled by Brunt for a duck while attempting a hook shot.         
	Shaw added to the New Zealand misery as she removed all-rounder Nicola Browne for just one in the 11th over, and at 31 for five New Zealand were staring down the barrel.         
	Sara McGlashan (9) and Sarah Tsukigawa (5) were out while trying to accelerate the run rate in the 15th and 17th overs respectively, both to Jenny Gunn.         
	Amy Satterthwaite tried to push the New Zealand innings but fell for a defiant innings of 19 off 42 balls.         
	Kate Pulford gave some fireworks towards the close with three fours before falling to Charlotte Edwards for a 14 off 10 balls. Sophie Devine was run out for 10 in the last ball of the innings to end an insipid New Zealand batting display.

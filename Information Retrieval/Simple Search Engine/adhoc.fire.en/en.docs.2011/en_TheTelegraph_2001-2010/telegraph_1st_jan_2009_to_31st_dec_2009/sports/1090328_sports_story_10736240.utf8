                                                   Padukone a legend: Indonesian coach
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hyderabad: If former world No.3 Luis Pongoh is to be believed, then badminton legend Prakash Padukone is more famous in Indonesia than in his own country.         
	Pongoh, currently here as the coach of the Indonesian squad for the Indian open, said the Indian was one of the finest players he had ever played against.         
	Back in my country, theyve still got high regard for Prakash, Pongoh said.         
	So much so, that in Jakarta we have a street named after him.         
	Pongoh, who fought innumerable battles on badminton courts against Padukone in the 80s, was sad that the Bangalore based former All-England and world champion was not present at the Indian Open.         
	I was looking forward to meeting him. Prakash was the best touch player of his time. No doubt about that, said Pongoh.         
	Pongoh also remembered the Indians control at the net. He (Prakash) could not be beaten at the net. His control at the net was simply amazing. It was as if you could never win a point against him at the net.         
	After Prakash won the All-England title, all of us Indonesians were scared of him. We used to call him the Indian tornado. He was great.

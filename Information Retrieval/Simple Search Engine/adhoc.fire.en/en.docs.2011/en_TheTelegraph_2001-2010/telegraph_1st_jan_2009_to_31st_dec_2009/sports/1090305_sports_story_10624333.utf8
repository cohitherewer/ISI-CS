The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand draws, at joint third
                                                   Anand draws, at joint third
                                Anand    
	Linares: Viswanathan Anand played his fifth draw on the trot and remained in joint third spot after the end of the 11th round of Linares chess tournament, here on Wednesday.         
	Anand could not break Wang Yues defence. Wang played white and took his points tally to 5.5 out of a possible 11.         
	Playing black against Wang Yue, Anand stuck to his pet Nimzo Indian and did not face much difficulty in maintaining the balance.         
	Anand proposed the draw after making his 27th move, which was immediately accepted. With just three rounds to come, it is a now or never situation for Anand and if the Indian ace has to catch up with Grischuk, he will have to strike immediately.         
	None of the four games in the day could produce a decisive result leaving the standings intact as they were after the end of the 10th round.         
	Alexander Grischuk played out a draw with Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan to retain his full point lead over Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine who signed peace with Magnus Carlsen of Norway.         
	With Grischuk on seven points and Ivanchuk a point behind, the trio of Anand, Carlsen and Levon Aronian stand joint third on 5.5 points each. The sixth place is shared by Wang Yue and Radjabov on 5 points apiece. Lenier Dominguez was another half point behind.

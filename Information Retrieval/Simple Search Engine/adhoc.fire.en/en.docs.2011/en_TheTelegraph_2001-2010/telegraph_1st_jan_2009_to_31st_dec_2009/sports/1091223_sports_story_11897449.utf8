The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No plan to terminate contracts, says Modi
                                                                                                                       7                                      No plan to terminate contracts, says Modi
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Melbourne: IPL chairman and commissioner Lalit Modi on Tuesday refuted reports that he has threatened to terminate the contracts of Australian players and ban state sides from the Champions League if they fail to release their players for the third edition of the T20 event.         
	Dates of the last round of the Australias domestic competition  Sheffield Shield  and the mega BCCI event are clashing but Modi wants states sides to release their contracted players for the competition, reports in Australian media said.         
	Media reports appearing today, stating that the IPL is threatening to tear up and throw away contracts of overseas players are absolutely untrue and baseless. The IPL has No Objection Certificates (NOCs) from the home boards for players to participate in the IPL, which was essentially done to protect the FTP commitments, Modi said in a statement.         
	We are aware that this year a part of the IPL Season 2010 does overlap with domestic tournaments and given that this is a one-off situation, we will be considerate. While the IPL can ask the players to fulfil their contractual obligations, we want to work out a constructive solution with the consent of all the cricket boards to resolve the issue at the earliest, said the IPL chairman.         
	Modi was earlier quoted as saying in Australia that they respect players commitments to their countries but wont mind if players skip domestic duties for the IPL.         
	The IPL 2010 season is in March-April, when a lot of domestic tournaments will still be on. This is a one-off situation. The IPL requires NOCs from the home boards for players to participate in the IPL.         
	This was essentially done to protect the FTP commitments. However, this (NOC) does not include domestic tournaments, Modi was quoted as saying.

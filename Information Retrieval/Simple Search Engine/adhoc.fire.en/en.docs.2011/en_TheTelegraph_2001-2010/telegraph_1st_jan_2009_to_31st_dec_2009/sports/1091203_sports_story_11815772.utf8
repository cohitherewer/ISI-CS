The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spaniards start firm favourites 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Spaniards start firm favourites 
                      
	London: Spain playing Davis Cup tennis on clay in front of a home crowd is about as close to a sure thing as sport provides, and just because Rafael Nadal suddenly looks vulnerable the Czech Republic are not about to forget it.         
	Spain go into this weekends final as defending champions and with every reason to relish the prospect of a return to Barcelonas Palau Sant Jordi, the indoor arena that played host to their first Davis Cup final win in 2000.         
	Nadal has been struggling of late, failing to win so much as a set in the ATP finals last week, but he and the rest of the Spanish team are such consummate performers on clay that to underestimate them would be unwise to say the least.         
	We are outsiders in Barcelona, Czech number one Radek Stepanek told newspaper Mlada Fronta Dnes.         
	To take into consideration Nadals failure in London? That doesnt work. The moment he steps on to the Barcelona clay, he will be a totally different player.         
	Nadal, four times French Open champion, heads a formidable line-up that also includes world number nine Fernando Verdasco, David Ferrer (ranked 18th) and Feliciano Lopez (47).         
	Captain Albert Costa was part of the team that overcame Australia in a memorable tussle at the Palau in 2000, when huge crowds screamed themselves hoarse in support of their team.         
	It was clear watching Nadal in London that he has not yet recovered the magic formula of strength, skill and utter self-belief that made him such an irresistible force before tendonitis struck this season, keeping him out of Wimbledon and wrecking his chances of ending the year as world No. 1.

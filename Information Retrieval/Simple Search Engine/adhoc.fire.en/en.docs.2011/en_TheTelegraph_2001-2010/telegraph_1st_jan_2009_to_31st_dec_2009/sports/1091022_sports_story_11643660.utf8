            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting, unlike citys I-League teams  Mohun Bagan, East Bengal and Chirag United  would like to put up their best show in the Calcutta Football League because they dont have the premier tournament to worry about.         
	First up for them will be the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) on Thursday. With Theodore Sunday back after a 10-month injury lay-off and Brazilian playmaker Eduardo Escobar looking in good touch, Shabbir Alis wards would start favourites.         
	We will try our best. With Theodore back we hope to take full points though CPT are a good side, Shabbir said.

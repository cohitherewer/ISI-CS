	The 22-year-old kept his cool and added 35 runs along with last man Nazmul Hossain to snatch victory from Zimbabwe, with the hosts finishing the series comfortable 4-1 winners.         
	Brendan Taylor hit a brilliant 118 not out  his maiden century  off 125 balls to propel the visitors to 221 for nine wickets, with Man-of-the-Series Abdur Razzak sharing the wickets with Shakib Al Hasan and Mahmudullah.         
	Right to the end I never thought we would lose, said Naeem, who was well supported earlier in his innings by Mahmudullah. (AFP)

                                                   Need to bowl, field well: Yuvi
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	London: Team India vice-captain Yuvraj Singh spoke to the media on Saturday, the eve of their Super Eight match against England at Lords.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Reflections on the match against the West Indies         
	We had an off day yesterday (Friday)... We are very positive about the game against England. Yusuf (Pathan) and I had a good partnership We need to bowl and field well in the last 10 overs.         
	The areas we need to improve         
	We had good six overs when we bowled, and they had also good six overs when they bowled. If the top four gets runs and we can improve upon our fielding we can do better.         
	The pressure element         
	Being the defending champions there is always pressure... In T20 anything may happen, for example, Australia went out. We understand the situation and are confident. We are mentally prepared.         
	If hitting six sixes in one over against Stuart Broad in 2007 gives him a psychological edge         
	I dont believe in mind games, but those six sixes would be at the back of my mind... Theres history and theres always history in the making (as well)...         
	The importance of Sundays game         
	There is always a big challenge between India and England. When you play for your country there is a lot of passion involved, and sometimes it can bring the best out of you. The important thing is to check your emotions.         
	If he wants to bat up the order         
	The captain and coach decides where I bat. Any batsman would like to bat up It is important that if you are getting runs, make the most of it. But the team always comes first. As vice-captain there is a bit more responsibility... But I am not thinking too much about it.         
	If the schedule is taxing         
	It is tough for all the teams. You play the next day and you have to make plans for the next opposition. We have been doing that for a while, in the IPL too. As international cricketer, you have to understand where you are lacking. As I said we are geared up.         
	If another loss will mean things difficult         
	I am not thinking about one more bad game. We have won 80 per cent of matches and I am sure we can repeat that.Whether he remembers being called a pie-chucker by Kevin Pietersen last year I would like to bowl to him again. And I am sure he would like to call me a pie-chucker.

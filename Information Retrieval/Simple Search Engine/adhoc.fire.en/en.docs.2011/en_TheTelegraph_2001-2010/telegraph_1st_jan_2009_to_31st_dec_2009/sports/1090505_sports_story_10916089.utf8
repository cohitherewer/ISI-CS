The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | John asks for more foreigners
                                                   John asks for more foreigners
                      
	Port Elizabeth: John Buchanan, the Kolkata Knight Riders director of cricket operations, has floated the idea of having more than the regulation four foreign players in the playing XI of the Indian Premier League (IPL) sides.         
	Buchanan said he had taken up the issue with the IPL authorities and was hopeful that if not this season, then such a thing would be allowed in the third edition of the T20 league. It is a question that we have posed to the IPL a number of times about the involvement of more (foreign) players on the field. I have personally mentioned that a number of times, Buchanan said.         
	Hopefully the IPL will look at that more seriously going forward into next season and beyond, the Australian told reporters Monday.         
	Buchanan was asked about Mashrafe Mortazas surprising omission from the playing XI. At the moment, we have adopted a batting strategy. So thats where our international effort is. So guys that are international bowlers, whether it be (Charl) Langeveldt, Mortaza, (Ajantha) Mendis whoever it might be, their opportunities are limited at this time, he said.

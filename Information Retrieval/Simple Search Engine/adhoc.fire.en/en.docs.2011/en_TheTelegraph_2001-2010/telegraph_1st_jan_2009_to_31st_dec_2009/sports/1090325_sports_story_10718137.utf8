The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Historic series victory beckons Team India
                                                   Historic series victory beckons Team India
                      
	Napier: India take on a demoralised New Zealand in the second Test here Thursday with a historic series victory, that will end a 41-year wait for triumph in the antipodes, in sight.         
	Leading 1-0, the Indians are high on confidence and will be keen to wrap up the three-match series.         
	The ultimate test of this teams character would be a series triumph here. If the current bunch cant achieve what Mansur Ali Khan Pataudis men did in 1967-68, New Zealand at home may prove a tough nut to crack for the Indians when the Sachin Tendulkars, Rahul Dravids and the Zaheer Khans are gone.         
	Interestingly, if India (118 points) win this Test they could possibly replace South Africa (119) at No.2 in the ICC Test rankings. Australia are comfortably perched at the top with 128 points.         
	Tendulkar has been on a high on this tour, scoring big hundreds in both forms of the game (163 retired hurt in the third ODI at Christchurch; 160 in the first Test at Hamilton).         
	Apart from Tendulkar, Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman and Gautam Gambhir too have been on song and, with Yuvraj Singh and Dhoni providing ballast to the middle order, the team looks well-poised to clinch the series at Napier itself.         
	Ishant Sharma lacked zing in the last game, where he tended to go astray in his search for pace. But now, the pacer has got his rhythm back.         
	Having experienced steep highs and abysmal lows in their campaign against India, New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori is desperate that his men produce something extraordinary in the second Test at Mclean Park.         
	Meanwhile, opening batsman Jamie How was added to the New Zealand squad for the second Test against India as injury concerns lingered over Daniel Flynn.         
	Teams         
	India (likely): Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, V.V.S. Laxman, Yuvraj Singh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma, Munaf Patel.         
	New Zealand (from): Daniel Vettori, Daniel Flynn, James Franklin, Martin Guptill, Tim McIntosh, Brendon McCullum, Chris Martin, Kyle Mills, Iain Brien, Jeetan Patel, Jesse Ryder, Ross Taylor, Jamie How.         
	Match starts: 3am (IST, Thursday)                 (AGENCIES)

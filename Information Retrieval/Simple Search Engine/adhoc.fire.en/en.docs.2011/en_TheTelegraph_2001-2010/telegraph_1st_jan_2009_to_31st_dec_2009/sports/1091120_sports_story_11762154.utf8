The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev is slow but steady

	Dubai: Jeev Milkha Singh turned in a sedate two-under 70 to be tied 14th after the opening round of the $7.5 million Dubai World Championship golf tournament on Thursday.         
	But for a bogey on the third, Jeev would have practically no complaints about his front-nine at the picturesque Earth Course of the Jumeirah Golf Estates.         
	Jeev birdied the opening hole before the third hole setback left him even-par; He responded with birdies on the fifth and ninth holes to go two-under at the turn.         
	Once again, his progress was somewhat compromised with the bogey on the par-four 12th hole.         
	Two par shots later, Jeev redeemed himself, sinking a birdie on the par-four 15th and parred the next three holes to sign off with a two-under card.         
	Australian Robert Allenby blasted a sensational seven-under 65 for the opening round lead over Colombian Camilo Villegas and Britons Chris Wood and Lee Westwood, who blasted identical 66s for a share of the second spot.         
	Allenby, a 38-year-old Australian who plays mainly on the US PGA tour, had eight birdies and only one bogey on the Earth Course, which is hosting the final event of the European Tour season.         
	When the tournament ends Sunday, the top player on the European Tours money list will win a $1.5 million bonus from the new Race to Dubai.         
	Westwood, lying second in the race, was two shots ahead of money leader McIlroy of Northern Ireland, who shot a 68. Westwood produced three birdies in the final four holes to boost his chances of overtaking McIlroys $191,000 lead in the money race.         
	The two other players in contention for the money title were further off the pace. Germanys Martin Kaymer shot a 71, and Englands Ross Fisher had a 73.         
	Earlier in the day, Villegas and Wood, playing for the first time in a month after injuring an ankle during a tournament in Spain, had taken the clubhouse lead with 66s. That score was matched later in the day by Westwood. (agencies)

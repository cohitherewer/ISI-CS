                                                   Gilly: An amazing experience
            OUR BUREAU                      
	From laggards to champions! A fairytale ending for the Deccan Chargers. Captain Adam Gilchrist couldnt have asked for anything better.         
	The heart went out to Anil Kumble! He bowled superbly, taking four wickets, and restricting the Deccan Chargers to 143. It looked an achievable target but the Royal Challengers Bangalore batsmen fell to a mixture of good bowling and reckless shots.         
	With 15 runs required off the last over, purple cap winner Rudra Pratap Singh bowled a disciplined line as the Royal Challengers fell short by six runs. In the end, Herschelle Gibbss controlled 53 not out turned out to be decisive. It wasnt pretty, it wasnt massive, but he hung on to see off the Royal Challengers challenge.         
	Expectedly, the Deccan Chargers were over the moon after the victory.               
	The following are excerpts               
	GILCHRIST: Its an amazing experience especially after our showing in last years competition. Everyone got on the board today to snatch victory. It was great on the part of the organisers to arrange such an extravaganza at a short notice. Credit must go to the IPL organisers and Cricket South Africa for putting up a beautiful show.         
	RAY JENNINGS (Challengers coach): We didnt bowl and bat as well as we could have done. But if you look at our performance all through the tournament, we made a spirited comeback after struggling a bit midway in the tournament. So, I cant say that Im entirely disappointed with our effort in this tournament The wicket was a lot harder today (Sunday) we needed a solid start and a good performance to see us through. But unfortunately both didnt happen. We lost today but we did have a good tournament.         
	ROSS TAYLOR: I was positive about our chances. We were happy to chase a total of 144. But we lost wickets at wrong times. That cost us the match. Its a bit disappointing to lose after coming this far in the tournament but we are proud of our performance. Some of our guys came up with great results. Hopefully, next year, we will manage to go a step further.

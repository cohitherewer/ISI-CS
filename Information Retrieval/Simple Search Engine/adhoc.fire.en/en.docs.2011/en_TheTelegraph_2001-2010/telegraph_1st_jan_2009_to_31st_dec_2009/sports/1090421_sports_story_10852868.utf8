The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cake for one and words of comfort for the other
                                                   Cake for one and words of comfort for the other
    - Brendon McCullum bombarded with questions on Sourav Ganguly           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Durban: Battered and bruised, the Kolkata Knight Riders returned to The Cullinan hotel, in Cape Town, before the Deccan Chargers did (on Sunday night).         
	There were no fans around, but a massive chocolate cake was placed in the centre of the lobby. What, is it for losing? asked one of the Knights, while others too had a puzzled look.         
	As it turned out, the chocolate delight had been ordered by the Chargers management, little realising it would be in the open before Adam Gilchrist and Co. got back.         
	On returning, Gilchrist (having made a winning debut as franchise captain) did the honours, giving the first piece to assistant coach Kawaljeet Singh, an outstanding off-spinner who missed out playing for India as nobody pushed his case.         
	The Chargers sang happy birthday, though Singh had turned 51 a few days ago. The boys decided a cake would be cut at an appropriate time... What couldve been better than the day we made such a great start (whipping the Knights by eight wickets) in the IPL? Ive been touched, he told The Telegraph.         
	Minutes after the Chargers cake-cutting exercise was over, in walked the Knights principal owner, Shah Rukh Khan, ringed by three security officers and his personal bodyguard. He brought nothing, except words of comfort.         
	The celluloid superstar hates losing, but his body-language gave little away.         
	Shah Rukh spent around 45 minutes at the poolside, where his players and support staff had gathered. He didnt speak to everyone, but a round of beverages was ordered for all.         
	Before leaving, in a very public attempt to show that icon Sourav Ganguly still mattered, Shah Rukh went along with his former captain to his fourth-floor room.         
	Shah Rukh was there for a few minutes, but on coming out, declined to say anything. As for Sourav, he said: It wasnt anything special... Shah Rukh decided to see me off to my room, thats it.         
	Well, do such gestures count?         
	The last-minute change in the Knights captaincy has, for now at least, created insecurity and put most, not least new captain Brendon McCullum, under pressure.         
	Sourav also, in some ways.         
	Not surprisingly, after the thrashing, McCullum had to fend a series of Sourav-related questions at the media conference.         
	For the New Zealander, it actually was baptism by fire.         
	At the same Q amp;A session, McCullum defended Aakash Chopras inclusion in the XI, at No.5, but questions will continue to be raised over his worth.         
	Its simply baffling how somebody regarded as somewhat of a strokeless wonder in Test cricket gets projected as a key T20 player.         
	But, then, surprises dont seem to cease.         
	The Knights next match is against the Kings XI Punjab, at Kingsmead here, on Tuesday.         
	Both teams have hit town.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AIFF plays numbers game again 
                                                   AIFF plays numbers game again 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: A few months after increasing the quota of foreign players in the I-League, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is now thinking of reducing their numbers once again.         
	The AIFF general secretary, Alberto Colaco, on Thursday has written a letter to the member associations asking their opinion on the issue. The move has come almost immediately after the national coach Bob Houghton expressed his reservations about too many foreigners playing in the I-League.         
	Currently, an I-League club is allowed to recruit five foreigners that include one player from an Asian country and one under the Player of Indian Origin (PIO) quota. Houghton, who addressed the state association representatives and executive committee members during the annual general meeting of the AIFF on Tuesday said the rule would not help the local footballers to grow.         
	According to sources, Houghton called the PIO rule foolish and said even the Asian quota rule was only blocking the progress of Indian players. Citing the example of Churchill Brothers, the national coach said the inclusion of Japanese midfielder Dan Ito in the Goan side has sidelined Chandam Chitrasen, who was doing well for the last few seasons.         
	Houghton pointed out the PIO rule was of no practical use and it would always be difficult to convince a footballer under the PIO quota to surrender his previous passport and take up Indian citizenship to play for the national team.         
	In the letter written to the state associations on Thursday, Colaco said that there was a feeling around that too many foreigners were playing in Indian football.         
	He has asked the members to consider the issue and reply by November 30 so that a discussion can be initiated among all stakeholders.         
	Houghton, meanwhile, has drawn up a tentative list of national campers for the senior team and the team that would take part in the SAFF Cup on Bangladesh in December. Sources in the AIFF said there could be some changes in the list in the later stages.

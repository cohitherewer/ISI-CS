The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhullar finishes second best
                                                     Bhullar finishes second best
                  Gaganjeet Bhullar                     
	Bandar Seri Begawan (Brunei): Gaganjeet Bhullar came agonisingly close to a second successive Asian Tour title but a missed birdie put paid to his chances as he lost a three-way play-off to finish runner-up at the Brunei Open here Sunday.         
	Bhullar, who returned a two-under 69 in the final round, could have become the first player to win back-to-back titles on the Asian Tour this season had the 21-year-old birdied his closing shot on the 18th hole from eight feet.         
	I had a very good second shot on my 72nd hole but I clearly misread the line, said Bhullar, who won the Indonesian Open Invitational last week.         
	Bhullar managed four birdies  including a hattrick from the first to third hole  against a couple of bogeys.         
	Australias Darren Beck completed a remarkable comeback by winning the title after sinking in a birdie on the third play-off hole.         
	Beck, who had started his final round six shots off the lead, fired a sparkling six-under 65 to force a three-way play-off with Bhullar and Thai veteran Boonchu Ruangkit after the pair returned with 13-under-par 271 total in regulation play.         
	When Boonchu bogeyed his shot at the second play-off hole and Beck and Bhullar making pars each, it was down to the par-four ninth hole to decide the winner at the $ 300,000 Asian Tour event.         
	The 32-year-old Australian sealed his career breakthrough on the Asian Tour when he birdied from 10 feet even as Bhullar could only par his shot.         
	I would like to congratulate Darren for his overdue victory and he really deserves his victory, said Bhullar.         
	Among other Indians, C. Muniyappa faltered in the final round, carding a one-over 72 to finish tied 13th with a total of nine-under 275.         
	Anirban Lahiri signed off tied 18th after a 67 in the final round left him seven-under overall. Chiragh Kumar was further down at tied 29th after returning an even-par 71 to total five-under 279.         
	Gaurav Ghei (70) ended tied 49th with a total of one-under 283.         
	Bhullar had won the Indonesian Open Invitational with a total score of 22-under 266. That made the Kapurthala golfer only the eighth Indian to win an Asian Tour title.         
	Jeev Milkha Singh, Gaurav Ghei, Jyoti Randhawa, Arjun Atwal, Rahil Gangjee, Shiv and SSP Chowrasia were the other seven golfers. At 21, he also became the youngest ever Indian to win an international tour title.         
	Bhullar, in fact, is now being seen as the next Jeev Milkha. And Jeev himself is quite impressed by the 21-year-old golfer.         
	I am proud of Bhullar and it is good to see the young guns come through. I do hope there are youngsters in India who feel that if Jeev can do it, why not try and do it better than him, the senior pro was quoted as saying after Bhullars Indonesia triumph.

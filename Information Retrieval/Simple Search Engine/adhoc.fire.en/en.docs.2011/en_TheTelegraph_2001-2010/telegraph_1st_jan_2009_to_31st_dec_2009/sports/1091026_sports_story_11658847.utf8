                                                   Managers report
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal team manager Robert Rozario submitted his report to the Cricket Association of Bengal Sunday. According to sources, the report deals on specific issues like the lack of discipline in the team.         
	Bengal, who managed a solitary win in four matches in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy in Dhanbad, have had an unimpressive start to the season. The CAB had sought a strong managers report before taking any corrective measures.         
	The report talks about the problem of discipline and the matter will be discussed with the coach (Roger Binny) and the manager. The president, Jagmohan Dalmiya, will himself talk to the players, said a CAB official.         
	It was also learnt that the side may see a few changes. The captaincy issue was still not settled for the Ranji Trophy and will come up for discussion.

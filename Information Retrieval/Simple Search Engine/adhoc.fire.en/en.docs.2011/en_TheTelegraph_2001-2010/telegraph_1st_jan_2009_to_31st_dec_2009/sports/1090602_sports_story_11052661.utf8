	I am a right-handed batsman. I often get bowled when facing yorkers. Please help.  
	(Shroyon Sarkar, 14, Calcutta-50)              
	Watch the ball coming out of the bowlers hand. Also check your back-lift.                
	I am a right-arm medium pacer. When trying for pace I often end up bowling wide. Please help.  
	(Shayan Saha, 17, Calcutta-42)

	I am a right-handed batsman. Whenever I attempt the pull shot against short deliveries of low bounce, I end up getting caught inside the circle. Please help.  
	(Thangjakai Singson, 26, Manipur)              
	Pick the right length to play the shot. Also get under it if you are hitting over the fielder or get on top of the shot and roll your wrists when playing the shot.                
	What is the right way to play the cover drive? What should be the position of the feet?  
	(Swapan Thakur, 27, Calcutta-21)               
	The front foot should be close to the pitch of the ball and pointing in the direction you want the ball to go.                
	Whenever I try to take a high catch, I misjudge the flight of the ball. Please suggest the right technique in taking high catches.  
	(Md Ziauddin, 22, Calcutta)               
	Keep your eyes on the ball all the time and receive it in your hands as opposed to grabbing it.                
	I am a left-arm spinner. When I take my run-up diagonally for bowling round the wicket, I end up with a no ball. How do I stop this problem while coming closer to the wicket?  
	(Saran Samanta, 19, Calcutta 20)              
	Mark your run up again and start from say six inches behind.                
	I am a right-handed batsman and usually get bowled when the ball is pitched on the leg stump. Is something wrong with my stance?  
	(Sampath Datta, 16, Calcutta-27)               
	Make sure you are balanced and not falling over.

	Get closer to the pitch of the ball and keep your head down when playing the shot.                
	I am a pacer. I usually do a lot of running and gym sessions during off-season. Is this okay?  
	(Pradeep Sanken, 22, Guwahati)               
	Thats very good. Do a lot of stretching as well.                
	How does one prepare mentally before going out to bat?  
	(S. Sarkar, 20, Calcutta)              
	Know your strengths and focus on shot selection.

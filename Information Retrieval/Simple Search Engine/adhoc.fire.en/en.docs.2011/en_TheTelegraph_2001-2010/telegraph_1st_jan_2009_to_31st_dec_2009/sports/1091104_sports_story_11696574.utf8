The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Peter Siddle joins casualty ward 
                                                                                                                                     Peter Siddle joins casualty ward 
            A STAFF REPORTER            Peter Siddle                           
	Calcutta: Now Peter Siddle. The Australia pacer, Cricket Australia (CA) announced Tuesday, will return home after experiencing some stiffness in his left side during Mondays victory in the fourth ODI against India at Mohali.         
	Injuries in the team have already seen Tim Paine, James Hopes and Brett Lee catch the return flight to Australia and now Siddles withdrawal leaves the visitors bowling well-nigh threadbare.         
	Siddle bowled five overs during Australias victory and was not required to bowl again. Siddle has been on the road for quite some time now and was part of the Victoria Bushrangers squad for the inaugural Champions League T20.         
	Lee, too, had taken part in the Champions League, turning out for eventual champions New South Wales Blues. Lee had joined the touring party for Vadodaras first ODI with a sore elbow, and captain Ricky Ponting had openly expressed his displeasure with the match schedule, saying the timing of the Champions League had robbed the Australians of valuable practice time.         
	Now, with Siddle, too, set to return, Ponting would be praying for no more injuries.         
	CAs National Selection Panel was discussing the possibility of a replacement player joining the squad and said in the release that an announcement would be made in due course.         
	Meanwhile, Australia have been fined for maintaining a slow over-rate during Tuesdays one-dayer.         
	Match Referee Chris Broad imposed the fine after the visitors were ruled to be two overs short of their target at the end of the match when time allowances were taken into consideration, according to an International Cricket Council release.         
	The players were fined 10 per cent of their match fees while captain Ponting was fined 20 per cent of his fee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sangakkara: We threw it away in middle overs
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sangakkara: We threw it away in middle overs
    - Liked the no-nonsense approach of Sehwags captaincy, says sL captain           OUR CORRESPONDENT            Indians celebrate after dismissing Tillekaratne Dilshan during the third one-dayer, at the Barabati Stadium in Cuttack, on Monday. (AP)                                 
	Cuttack: Kumar Sangakkara had every reason to feel furious about his teams woeful batting. During his post-match interaction with the media, he didnt hide his disappointment.         
	They bowled extremely well and we batted very poorly. Thats how we lost the match, Sangakkara said.         
	It was a case of scoring three to four runs per over after we had reached 165 in 22 overs. That could have taken us close to 300 or may be more. But we just threw it away in the middle overs. Ravindra (Jadeja) bowled extremely well. We were playing one batsman short and everybody needed to take that additional responsibility, he added.         
	He denied that the Lankans were becoming overtly dependent on him and Dilshan to score big.         
	I dont agree that only the both of us can score everyday. We have very capable batsmen who unfortunately didnt fire on the day.         
	On keeping Sanath Jayasuriya out of his scheme of things, Sangakkara said: Before we came to India, we had reached a general consensus that Sanaths place was in the middle order. As you can see, our openers have put in nearly 200 in the first match, 100 in the second. Also we are playing two specialist spinners, he said.         
	He did, however, admit that Angelo Mathews was badly missed during the game. Angelo is one man whose presence has brought balance into the side.         
	He praised veteran Sachin Tendulkars efforts. He was brilliant today.         
	He, though, kept the best compliments for his counterpart Virender Sehwag.         
	Sehwag led the side really well. I liked the no-nonsense approach of his captaincy. Its pretty much similar to the way he bats, Sangakkara said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Refereeing puts off Shabbir
                                                   Refereeing puts off Shabbir
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali lamented the poor standard of refereeing in the I-League clash against Air India here on Sunday.         
	It was our own mistake that resulted in the red card (for Madhab Das) but if they do refereeing this way, it is not good for football, Ali said after the 1-1 draw at Cooperage.         
	Das was sent off after being shown a second yellow card in the match when he collided with rival midfielder Soccor Velho and then kicked him when both were down on the ground.         
	It was some scene when, during the match, Shabbir turned towards the media box and implored publicly, why dont you write about this, referring to Dass red card.         
	However, in the post-match press conference, Ali stopped short of saying that the referee was biased against his team.         
	Alis counterpart Bimal Ghosh had no problems with refereeing though. In fact, Ghosh was critical of Michael Tayo, who was also shown the red card for attempting to score with his hand.         
	If he was trying to do a Maradona, then he should have scored, Ghosh said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Second loss for Pak
                                                   Second loss for Pak
                      
	Ipoh: Pakistan slumped to their second successive defeat in the Sultan Azlan Shah hockey tournament, while hosts Malaysia registered back-to-back victories in the five-nation event Monday.         
	Thus Pakistans chances of qualifying for the April 12 final received a severe jolt after losing 2-3 to title favourites New Zealand in a round-robin match.         
	Malaysia, on the other hand, came one step closer towards the title clash when they thrashed Egypt 4-1 in the second match of the day.         
	The encounter between New Zealand and Pakistan was a close fought battle as the match went till the wire with the Black Sticks sealing the victory just two minutes from the hooter.         
	The Black Sticks, who came into the event with a young squad, scored through Priyesh Bana (seventh minute), Nicholas Haig (44th), and Dean Couzins (68th), while Dilawar Hussain (eighth) and Mohamed Imran (23) found the net for Pakistan.         
	After a rest day Tuesday, India will take on Malaysia on Wednesday. (PTI)

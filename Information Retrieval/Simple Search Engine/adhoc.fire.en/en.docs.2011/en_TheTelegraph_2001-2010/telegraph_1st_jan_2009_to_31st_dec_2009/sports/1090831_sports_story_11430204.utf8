The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | City keep clean slate 
                                                   City keep clean slate 
                      
	London: Manchester Citys new-look side continued their impressive start to the season when they preserved their 100 per cent record with a 1-0 win at Portsmouth in the Premier League on Sunday.         
	Emmanuel Adebayor, signed from Arsenal for 25m in the summer, kept his record of scoring in every league match since his transfer by heading in what proved to be the winner after 30 minutes.         
	Portsmouth, who have now lost their opening four league games, fell to the bottom of the table after Everton came from behind to beat Wigan Athletic 2-1 in the afternoons second match to gain their first points of the season.         
	Leighton Baines clinched all three points for Everton with a penalty deep into stoppage time against his old club. Paul Scharner put Wigan ahead with a diving header after 57 minutes before Louis Saha equalised for Everton five minutes later.         
	City meanwhile continued their great start when Adebayopr rose unmarked from a crowded penalty area to powerfully head home Gareth Barrys corner.         
	That proved enough to consign Portsmouth to another defeat and their worst start to a season for 55 years.

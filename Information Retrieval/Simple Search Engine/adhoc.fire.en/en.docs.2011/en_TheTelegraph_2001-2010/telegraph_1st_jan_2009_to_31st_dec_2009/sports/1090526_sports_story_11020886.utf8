                                                   Twenty20 a concern for England players
            Nick Hoult                      
	Johannesburg: As the Indian Premier Premier League rulers, players and hangers on packed up their party and headed back to Mumbai, the organisers of the second IPL were setting their logistical minds on making a success of the Champions League Twenty20, which they will throw on for the first time this October.         
	That competition, due to last little more than two weeks, has been quietly slipped into the international calendar and already will be etched into the packed diaries of the three England players whose IPL franchises have qualified for the tournament.         
	If Kevin Pietersen, Paul Collingwood and Owais Shah were hoping for a break between the Champions Trophy and Englands tour to South Africa then they were almost as mistaken as their counties, who will soon discover that IPL teams have first pick in the Champions League.         
	England have a packed schedule in the coming months and after the ODI series at home to the West Indies, the third and final match of which is at Birmingham Tuesday, they have the ICC World T20 followed by the all-important Ashes.         
	The demands on time and bodies will take their toll and it appears the English players union are the latest to predict a string of retirements from Test cricket.

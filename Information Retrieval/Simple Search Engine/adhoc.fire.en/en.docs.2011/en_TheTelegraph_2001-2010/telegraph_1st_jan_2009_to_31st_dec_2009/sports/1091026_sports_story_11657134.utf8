The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India end series with win
                                                   India end series with win
                      
	Surrey: India rounded off their impressive tour of Canada with a 3-2 victory over the home side in their final game to win the seven-match hockey Test series 6-0, at Tamanawis Park here.         
	India, who led 2-1 at half time, scored through Prabhjot Singh (21st minute), Gurwinder Chandi (31st) and Tushar Khandker (49th). Wayne Fernandes flicked home twice for Canada in the 26th and 46th minutes. One match of the series was drawn.         
	The Indians made their intentions clear from the very beginning when Sarwanjit Singh tested Canadian goalkeeper David Carter in the opening minute followed by captain Rajpal Singhs attempt which narrowly missed the mark.         
	Canada took some time to settle down but soon produced a couple of fine moves which tested the Indian goalkeeper Adrian DSouza.         
	First Philip Wright missed a deflection from Rob Short and then Gabbar Singhs effort went in vain as DSouza brought off a one of his splendid saves.         
	India broke the ice in the 21st minute after midfielder Sardar Singh picked up the pace. Sardar sent a well-measured pass to Shivendra Singh who in turn pushed to the waiting Prabhjot atop the striking circle. The first timer from Prabhjot went past Carter to give India the lead.         
	Canada nearly pulled one back shortly but Connor Meakins deflection was saved by DSouza.         
	A faulty stick tackle by Bharat Chhikara in the circle led to Canadas two successive penalty corners which Fernandes sank for the equaliser in the 26th minute.         
	Canada nearly took the lead but DSouza again saved a Wright shot as the home team striker got past Indian defenders Dhananjay Mahadik and Sandeep Singh.         
	But it was India who forged ahead in the 31st minute as Chandi excelled with individual play and tapped the ball into goal after drawing out Carter.         
	Canada missed a chance to equalise close to half time with David Jameson failing to beat DSouza with two rebounds.         
	India earned their first of two penalty corners after the change of ends but Sandeep shot wide. Chandi had another goal scoring opportunity but Carter made a glove save.         
	Canada put pressure on the shaky Indian defence but found the alert DSouza rising to the occasion as he blocked another onslaught from a Jameson and Wright combination. The hosts restored parity in the 46th minute when Fernandes struck again with his flick from Canadas third penalty corner.         
	Three minutes later India rejoiced again as Khandker found the mark from a Gurbaj Singh set up. (PTI)

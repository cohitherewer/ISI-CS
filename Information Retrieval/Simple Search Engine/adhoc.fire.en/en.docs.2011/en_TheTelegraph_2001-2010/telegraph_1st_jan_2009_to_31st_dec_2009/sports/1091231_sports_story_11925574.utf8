            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Bhaichung Bhutia and Uga Okpara during a practice session, in Guwahati, on Wednesday. Picture: Eastern Projections                           
	Guwahati: The clash of the titans on New Year Eve! The very thought of an East Bengal versus Mohun Bagan can give you goose bumps.         
	So what if the Dempos and the Churchill Brothers have made rapid strides and the Calcutta Big Two are playing catch-up, when it comes to history and passion behind the Big Fight, everything else seems to be so mundane and inconsequential.         
	So, on Thursday, when East Bengal run into Mohun Bagan in the second semi-final of the Federation Cup at the Nehru Stadium, Guwahati can expect a lot of fireworks. There will be adrenaline rush, some nasty tackles, a push here and a shove there. The rival players are close friends off the field but on the field, nobody will give up an inch without a fight.         
	The Thursday clash assumes extra importance since the two are meeting for the first time since Bagans historic 5-3 victory in the I-League encounter. The green and maroon brigade will surely like to add insult to East Bengals injury  another five goals will be too much to ask for though  and the red and gold brigade will definitely seek revenge. Conceding five goals is one thing the fans will take ages to forget.         
	The hero of that October 25 clash, Edeh Chidi, is in rousing form. He is scoring goals left, right and centre and he will be the man East bengal will be wary of. And then Bagan have the talismanic Jose Ramirez Barreto. He is one player capable of making a difference single-handedly. The two, along with Japanese Ryuji Sueoka, are expected to run amok against the likes of Uga Okpara and Mehrajuddin Wadoo.         
	It will be a very tough game. But we play every game to win and that will be our aim tomorrow (Thursday) as well, Chidi told mediapersons after a practice session on Wednesday.         
	Barreto said: The day the groupings were released, we knew well have a semi-final clash against East Bengal. This is the match we were eagerly waiting for, he said.         
	If Bagan are in good form in the ongoing Federation Cup, the same cannot be said about their rivals. East Bengal had to rely on Bhaichung Bhutias opportunism to make the cut. Against JCT, a half-fit Bhaichung came on as a substitute to score the winner. Will he be able do it against the club which, a few months ago, humiliated him for not playing an exhibition match?         
	If that happens it will be the perfect New Year gift for the fans and new coach Phillippe de Ridder.         
	The Belgian is beset with problems. Injuries to key players, bad signings by the previous coach and a low morale post October 25, have made it very difficult for De Ridder to put the house in order.         
	Yusif Yakubu and Syed Rahim Nabi are racing against time to be fit for the clash, while Bhutia is still not 100 per cent ready.         
	Bhaichung, on Wednesday, refused to admit that this clash is sort of a revenge tie. Its not. Im telling you guys. Yes, pressure is there but theres no revenge in the air. Tell me where in life you wont find pressure.         
	Pressure makes you stretch your limits, it helps you to strive for the best. Had there been no pressure, people would not exert themselves, he said.         
	Very few will disagree with the Sikkimese Sniper. For it comes from a man who knows how to deliver in pressure-cooker situations.

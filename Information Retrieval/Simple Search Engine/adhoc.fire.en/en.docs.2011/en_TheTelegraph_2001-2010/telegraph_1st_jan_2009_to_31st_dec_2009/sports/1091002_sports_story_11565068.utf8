                                                   Churchill held by Mahindra
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Churchill Brothers didnt start their I-League campaign in a very creditable fashion as they were held 1-1 by Mahindra United in the season opener at the Cooperage ground here on Thursday.         
	The defending champions actually escaped a loss as Mahindra failed to take advantage of the last half hour of the match when the Goans were down to 10 players following the sending-off of goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya.         
	Both goals were scored by foreigners, Svetozar Mijin and Dan Ito, on their I-League debut for Mahindra and Churchill respectively.         
	Mijin pounced on a loose ball inside the box to put Mahindra ahead in the26th minute but the lead lasted just seven minutes as the visitors found the equaliser through Ito who punched in a brilliant cross from Thokchom Naoba Singh from the right.         
	But Mahindra could have scored a few more easily. Mohammed Rafi had the easiest of chances when the ball continued to roll after Bhattacharya handled it outside the box but lost control. The Kerala youngster, however, chose to appeal instead of latching on to the ball and slotting it into the net. I was not thinking much, Rafi admitted later.         
	There were a couple of opportunities towards the end when Churchills reserve custodian Lalit Thapa went out of position while trying to collect the ball but the Mumbai outfit couldnt take advantage. Then, substitute Thoi Singhs header went just over the bar. But definitely Mahindra were the superior team.         
	The only worry for Mahindra could be the fitness of Steven Dias who was taken out of the field on a stretcher on the hour mark, immediately after making a typical cross that was fisted away by Bhattacharya. But coach David Booth said that he just suffered from cramps.

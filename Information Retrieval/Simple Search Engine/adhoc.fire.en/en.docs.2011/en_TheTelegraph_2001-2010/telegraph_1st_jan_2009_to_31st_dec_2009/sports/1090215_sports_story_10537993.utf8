The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Stanley sees no difference
                                                   Stanley sees no difference
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former East Bengal coach Stanley Rozario said he found no major change in East Bengals game under Subhas Bhowmick from when he was in charge.         
	Rozario was present at the Nehru Stadium in Margao, along with national coach Bob Houghton, during East Bengals 4-1 victory against bottom-placed Vasco in the I-League.         
	The same boys who played under me are playing in the current team. There are no major changes in their style of play, Rozario told The Telegraph from Goa.         
	The same (Yusif) Yakubu and Sunil (Chetri) scored, though it was against the bottom-placed Vasco. They played well today.         
	Rozario was at the helm at East Bengal in the first leg of the I-League and in the Federation Cup. But the red-and-gold-brigade ended the first leg in the bottom half. They also failed to make it to the final of the Federation Cup.         
	That led to the ouster of Rozario as the coach.         
	See there were quite a few factors why the team didnt click under me. I wont blame the players. But for a few things here and there, I would not have been sitting in Goa now, he said.         
	Rozario, presently with Salgaocar, was happy with Sunil Chetris return to form.         
	He is scoring regularly and playing hard Its good for him.         
	Rozario, the assistant to national coach Houghton, also picked Yakubu for special praise after Saturdays match.

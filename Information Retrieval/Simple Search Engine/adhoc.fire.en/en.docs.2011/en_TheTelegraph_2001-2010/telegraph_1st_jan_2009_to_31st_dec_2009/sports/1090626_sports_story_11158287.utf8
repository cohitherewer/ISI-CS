The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saina enters   quarter finals
                                                     Saina enters   quarter finals
                  Saina Nehwal                           
	Johor Bahru: Ace Indian shuttler Saina Nehwal continued her dream run to reach the quarter finals of the Malaysian Open Grand Prix with a three-game win over Intanon Ratchanok of Thailand here on Thursday.         
	Second seed Saina rallied to outlast Intanon 18-21, 21-12, 21-18 in a 46-minute clash to set up a quarter final with Chinese qualifier Xin Wang on Friday.         
	Xin thumped sixth seed Japanese Ai Goto 21-14, 21-14 in the other pre-quarter final.         
	Intanon played better from the nets and scored from her smashes but could not get past Saina, who recovered well from a game down to get the better of her Thai rival.         
	In a see-saw battle, Intanon had the upper hand when she overcame Saina in the first game. Even though Saina played well, the game slipped through her fingers.         
	With her back to the wall, the Indian, ranked world No. 8, switched into an aggressive mode in the next game and raced to a 9-6 lead before pocketing it comfortably at the end.         
	At 1-1, the decider turned out to be a perfect pot-boiler as fortunes fluctuated in a tooth-and-nail battle.         
	Saina raced to a 10-5 lead but the Thai soon reeled off four straight points to claw back and reduce the gap to 10-9 before Saina changed gears and eventually sealed the issue.         
	However, it was curtains for Arvind Bhat and Ajay Jayaram in mens singles.         
	Ninth seed Arvind was thrashed by Chinese Long Chen 5-21, 11-21 in just 27 minutes, while Ajay went down to Yun Hu of Hong Kong 15-21, 14-21 within half an hour.         
	Meanwhile, Indias mixed doubles pair of V. Diju and Jwala Gutta brushed aside the Malaysian duo of Wee tat Tan and Hui Ern Ng 21-12, 21-12 to move into the quarter finals where they will meet the Indonesian pair of Hendra Aprida Gunawan and Vita Marissa on Friday.         
	The mens doubles pair of Rupesh Kumar and Sanave Thomas won their first round match against the sixth seeded Chinese pair of Zhiben Chen and Ye Shen 14-21, 21-15, 21-16 in 53 minutes.         
	They will next face the Malaysian pair of Teik Chai Gan and Bin Shen Tan.           (PTI)

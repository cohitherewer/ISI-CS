The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pietersen is impressed with Yuvraj
                                                   Pietersen is impressed with Yuvraj
                      
	London: Former England captain Kevin Pietersen is impressed by the likes of Yuvraj Singh and feels players like him are taking Twenty20 cricket to the next level.         
	There are a number of players taking T20 to the next level. I think all-rounders have the most to offer in T20 cricket, Pietersen said on the eve of Englands ICC World Twenty20 opener against the Netherlands on Friday.         
	Im impressed by the likes of Yuvraj Singh of India  and other guys who can hit sixes, take wickets and generally field well, said the South Africa-born batsman who led the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the first half of the recently concluded Indian Premier League.         
	Pietersen considers the West Indies captain Chris Gayle as the most destructive batsman in Twenty20 cricket.         
	I rate Chris Gayle very highly  quite simply because his batting can tear apart even the best bowling. When he is in the groove, he is practically unstoppable. Its scary to watch him in full flight, he was quoted as saying by an England daily.         
	Among bowlers, Pietersen rated Brett Lee, Dale Steyn and Fidel Edwards as the toughest.         
	The likes of Lee, Edwards and Steyn are probably the toughest bowlers. They are world-class pace bowlers and are difficult to face across all forms of the game and certainly no easier in T20, he said.         
	The former skipper hoped his England teammates Stuart Broad and Ravi Bopara would shine in the Twenty20 World Cup.         
	I think Stuart Broad and Ravi Bopara could really come to the fore in this tournament. Theyre very exciting players on the rise in world cricket, said the 28-year-old.         
	Pietersen also said that with England hosting the tournament, they have a real chance of winning the title.         
	And the fact that we are playing in our own backyard is a real advantage for England. We certainly know how to handle the conditions and we usually play pretty well on our home grounds.         
	I would never discount us from doing well in the contest. The calibre of our players means were in with a very good chance, he said.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tough job for Chirag 
                                                   Tough job for Chirag 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal will miss injured Mehrajuddin Wadoo and Nirmal Chetri as they take the field against city rivals Chirag United in their inconsequential match of the 114th IFA Shield at the Barasat Stadium on Saturday.         
	While East Bengal are already out of the tournament, Chirag need to win the match with at least a margin of three goals to qualify for the semi-finals. A win for them will place them at par with TFA on four points, however, a victory by a three-goal margin will see them through on better goal difference.         
	And according to Chirag coach Subrata Bhattacharya, its a tough task. Its not an easy job at all, Subrata said after the practice session on Friday.         
	Beating East Bengal is not a joke and that cannot happen everyday. East Bengals loss to TFA was an accident. Sometimes it can happen in football But tomorrow they will comeback stronger, in a more organised manner, the veteran coach said.         
	Meanwhile, after a goalless draw against Air India in their first match, Senegal outfit AS Douanes are eyeing full points when they take on Pune FC at the Mohun Bagan ground on Saturday. We played a good match against Air India, Senegal coach Badara Sarr said on Friday.         
	For Pune FC, who are already out of the tournament, it will be a match to gain experience. For us, this was a good exposure. I know the boys will give their best tomorrow also, Pune FC coach Derek Pereira said.         
	India goalkeeper Subrata Paul will be present on the reserve bench to cheer his teammates against the Africans.

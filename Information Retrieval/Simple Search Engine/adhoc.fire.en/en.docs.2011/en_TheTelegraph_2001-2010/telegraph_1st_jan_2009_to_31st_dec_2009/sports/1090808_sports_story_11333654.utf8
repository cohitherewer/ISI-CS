The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karlovic ends Somdevs run
                                                   Karlovic ends Somdevs run
                      
	Washington: Somdev Dev Varmans dream run came to an end with a 5-7, 1-6 loss against the towering Ivo Karlovic of Croatia in the singles third round of the $1.4 million Washington Classic.         
	Somdev, who is Indias top-ranked singles tennis player, put up a brave face against Karlovic by holding his serves in the first set but failed to keep the momentum going as he was broken in the last game to concede the lead at the hardcourt ATP event Thursday night.         
	Somdev, who hit 70 per cent of his first serves, was also broken twice in the second set.         
	The 33-ranked Karlovic, who leads the number of aces on ATP Tour this season, fired overall 14 aces  11 in the first set  and had 63 per cent accuracy in his first serves against the Indian qualifier.         
	Its really hard to break his serve when he is serving that well, said Somdev.         
	I was doing well and then he got the break. Momentum went his way after that.         
	I feel like the summer started on the right note, said the Indian who jumps about 10 spots in the ATP rankings to be 143rd.         
	Top-seeded Andy Roddick won the 500th match of his professional career with a 7-6 (4), 6-4 win over Sam Querrey and will now take on Karlovic.         
	Roddick becomes the 36th player and the fourth active one to reach the milestone, joining Roger Federer, Carlos Moya and Lleyton Hewitt .

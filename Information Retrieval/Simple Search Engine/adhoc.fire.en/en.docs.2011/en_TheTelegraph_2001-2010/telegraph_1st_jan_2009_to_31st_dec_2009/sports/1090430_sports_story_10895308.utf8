                                                     Jonty: Not keen on national role
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Jonty                           
	Durban: Jonty Rhodes, arguably the most agile fielder ever, has (for now) no plans to again become a national fielding coach.         
	Im happy being the fielding coach of a franchise (the Mumbai Indians) in the IPL... That suits me just fine, allowing me to devote time to the businesses Im involved with, Jonty told The Telegraph.         
	Jonty, it may be recalled, had been South Africas fielding coach for a few years and is pretty close to the Team India coach, Gary Kirsten.  
	Gary has, a few times, bounced ideas off me... Thats it... In any case, you have a fielding coach (Robin Singh), Jonty said.

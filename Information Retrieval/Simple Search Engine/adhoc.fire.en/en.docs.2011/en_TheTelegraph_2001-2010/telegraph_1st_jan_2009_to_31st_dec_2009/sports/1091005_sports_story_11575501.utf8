The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev gets into swing
                                                   Jeev gets into swing
                      
	New York: Jeev Milkha Singh carded a flawless four-under 68 to leap to tied 30th but Arjun Atwal slipped to tied 49th after returning an even-par 72 in the third round of the Turning Stone Resort golf championship here.         
	Jeev has a total of six-under 210, while Atwal tallies four-under 212 after three rounds.         
	Off to a steady start, Jeev parred the first three holes before hitting back-to-back birdies on the fourth and fifth. Another birdie a couple of holes later left the Chandigarh-pro three-under at the turn.

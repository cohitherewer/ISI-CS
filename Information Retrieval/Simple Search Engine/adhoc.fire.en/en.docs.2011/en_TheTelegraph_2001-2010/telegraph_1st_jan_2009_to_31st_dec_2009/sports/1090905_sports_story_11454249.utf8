  - FIRST ODI 
  -  Fergusons unbeaten 71 takes visitors to 260/5       
	London: Callum Ferguson hit his highest one-day International score of 71 not out Friday to help Australia reach 260 for five wickets in the first of seven matches against an England side who kept the scoring rate down with some controlled spin bowling.               
	England were 208/6 after 45 overs. Luke Wright (32) and Adil Rashid (10) were at the crease               
	Cameron White and Shane Watson looked to be building a decent total at the Oval with an 82-run second-wicket partnership after England had put Australia in to bat.         
	Englands selection of Adil Rashid and Graeme Swann seemed to pay off as the two spinners, alongwith Paul Collingwood, stymied the scoring on a slow pitch in a mixture of sunny and overcast conditions.         
	Collingwood got rid of Watson for 46 and the second of two run outs accounted for White on 53 to leave Australia at 111 for three, with Michael Clark and Ferguson going on to build sizeable totals  but not at enough speed.         
	There were no sixes in the 50 overs but Ferguson, in his 15th ODI, did manage to score almost a run a ball.         
	Australia had stepped up the scoring to more than six runs per over between the eighth and 18th overs, but then stayed at about half that rate until Rashid completed his overs in the 34th. The wrist-spinner was unlucky to have a leg-before-wicket shout against Clarke turned down but still ended with economical figures of 10-0-37-0, in his first one-dayer against a Test-playing country.         
	Australia took the final Powerplay in the 43rd over but Collingwood immediately removed Clarke for 45 and Michael Hussey was clean bowled in the 48th over, charging down the wicket at Ryan Sidebottom. James Hopes was the unbeaten batsman alongside Ferguson on 18 off 11 balls.         
	England had started well despite Andersons first-ball wide. Stuart Broad sent down a maiden and Tim Paine was run out for a duck at the end of the third over.         
	Keen to get the scoreboard moving, Watson called the inexperienced Paine down the wicket for a quick single but the right-hander was about four yards out of his ground when Collingwood threw down the stumps. Paine did not even bother stretching out with his bat and kept trotting back to the pavilion.         
	But that was the only mistake Australia made in the first 18 overs as Watson and White guided their side to 93 for one. England regrouped at the drinks break and, five balls later, Watson tried to hit Collingwood through mid-wicket, and spooned the ball back to the bowler for a soft catch.         
	With Collingwood bowling, Australia again tried running for two when only one was available. Swann threw the ball in from the boundary to allow Matt Prior to take off the bails with White just short.         
	White departed with 53 from 71 balls for his first one-day half century, while Collingwood sent down one more over from the Vauxhall End to finish his initial six-over spell with one for 22.         
	Meanwhile, injured Joe Denly will miss the second ODI, too, adds a report.           (AP)

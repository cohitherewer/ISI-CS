The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Foreign trips top agenda
                                                     Foreign trips top agenda
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Brasa                           
	New Delhi: On Tuesday, when the ad hoc committee on hockey met at the Olympic Bhawan here, they spent more time in discussing foreign trips than the appointment of the national coach.         
	A member of the committee told The Telegraph after the meeting: Everyone was busy airing his own grievances. We didnt talk much about the Spanish coach Jose Brasa. The members also accused each other of trying to hog the limelight.         
	The meeting was hurriedly called by IOA president Suresh Kalmadi after secretary general Randhir Singh resigned from the ad hoc committee last week, citing lack of transparency and accountability within the body.         
	Kalmadi later said there was no rift among the current bunch of hockey administrators but Randhirs resignation has been accepted. Randhir would be too busy with the Commonwealth Games, he said.         
	It was evident that the ad hoc committee members did not deliberate much on reputed Spanish coach Jose Brasa, who was here last week.         
	Brasa is yet to submit his terms and conditions. Once he does that, we will see what to be done, said a committee member.         
	The Spanish coach, however, had clearly said he needed a contract till 2012. He had also specified the technical support he would require to coach the Indian team.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jayasuriya hungry for more runs
                                                   Jayasuriya hungry for more runs
                      
	Colombo: His team may have ended up on the losing side but explosive Sri Lankan batsman Sanath Jayasuriya says he would rate the century in Dambulla as one of his finest against India.         
	It (the century) will be the one I remember most among all the hundreds that I have scored against them (India), he said.         
	Jayasuriya said age is catching up with him but his enthusiasm has not diminished and he remains hungry for more runs.         
	I know I have aged but I still have the same keenness to make runs, he said.         
	At 39 years of age, the left-hander from Matara broke former England opener Geoff Boycotts record as the oldest man to score a century with his 28th century in Dambulla. I think my 107 on Wednesday was good because I was playing to meet the teams demands sure but we let that slip a bit at Dambulla, Jayasuriya said.

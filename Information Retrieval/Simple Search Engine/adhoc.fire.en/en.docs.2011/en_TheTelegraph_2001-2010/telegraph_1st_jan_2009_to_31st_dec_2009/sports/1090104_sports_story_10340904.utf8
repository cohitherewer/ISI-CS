The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Smith may miss home series too
                                                   Smith may miss home series too
                      
	Melbourne: South Africa captain Graeme Smith has admitted that he may have to sit out of the return series against Australia at home if his injured elbow does not heal after being injected with his own blood.         
	Smith will fly home after the ongoing third Test at the SCG to treat his elbow and will skip the five-match ODI series starting here on January 16.         
	If his elbow does not heal after the blood injection procedure, Smith said he would have to undergo surgery and in that case he will have to miss the Test series against Australia at home which starts in Johannesburg from February 26.         
	Obviously this (blood injection) is the last port of call before surgery and hopefully it works. If it doesnt, Ill go as far as I can and do what I have to do, I guess, Smith said.         
	I think its probably reached the point of surgery, but the length of time out after having surgery is probably eight to 12 weeks, so it doesnt give me much time to do that now. The length of time needed to recover from surgery fully wouldnt allow me to be fit for the home series. I guess weve got to look and see where we go and see how the home series goes and hopefully something works out.         
	Smith said the procedure of injecting own blood into the damaged area of his elbow was something that has not been done before and he is hoping it works.         
	Its not a gamble at all. Its pretty simple, I guess. You take your own blood and inject it into the tear. It sounds pretty simple. Most of the studies have been done over here and its been done a few times with some success. Hopefully it works. If it doesnt, then I go to surgery.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Jose Brasa                           
	Mumbai: In a move that is a clear snub to head coach Jose Brasa and a victory for the rebelling players, Hockey India president A.K. Mattoo Thursday denied Rajpal Singhs appointment as captain for the forthcoming Champions Challenge tournament.         
	Mattoo, who flew to Pune where the Indian contingent is preparing for next months multilateral tournament, stopped short of reinstating drag-flicker Sandeep Singh as the captain.         
	Who said Rajpal Singh was the captain? We (Hockey India) never said so, Mattoo was reported as saying during a news conference at the Balewadi Sports Complex.         
	Spaniard Brasa had earlier named Rajpal captain and told reporters that Sandeep would not be part of the Indian squad for the December 6-13 tournament due to a back strain.         
	Mattoo said a final decision on Sandeeps participation for the event was yet to be taken.         
	The winners in the in Argentine city of Salta will secure a berth in next years Champions Trophy.         
	We will study the medical reports and take a decision in the next couple of days, he said.         
	The development came on the heels of a player revolt against Brasa, whom his wards  in a letter to Hockey India  reportedly accused of acting in a high-handed manner.         
	The players were led by Sandeep Singh, who was dropped as captain for the seven-match series against Canada.         
	Mattoo, team sources said, had a series of one-on-one sessions with the players from noon onwards for around three hours before holding a detailed discussion with Brasa and the coaching staff.         
	I have asked Brasa to keep his staff in the loop regarding his coaching methods and the strategy, the HI chief said.         
	This could be a clear reference to the players alleged dislike of Brasas tactics and his concept of having a rolling captaincy instead of a permanent leader.         
	Brasa as well as Harendra Singh, the national coach, could not be reached for his comments. The rest of the coaching staff too kept mum.

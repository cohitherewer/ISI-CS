The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Benn suspended for misconduct
                                                                                                                       7                                        Benn suspended for misconduct
            A STAFF REPORTER            Benn                           
	Dubai: West Indies spinner Sulieman Benn has been suspended for a Test or two ODIs, while Australias Brad Haddin and Mitchell Johnson have been fined 25 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, of their match fees, after being found guilty of breaching the ICC Code of Conduct on Thursday in Perth.         
	Benn will miss the first two one-dayers against Australia in Melbourne and Adelaide on February 7 and 9, according to an ICC release Friday. Benn was charged with an article 2.2.11 offence, while both Haddin and Johnson were charged with an article 2.1.8 offence. Both these offences prohibit players from conducting themselves in any way that is not in accordance with the spirit of the game.         
	The incident that led to the charges being laid took place during the 118th over of Australias first innings. On the first ball of the over, Benn collided with non-striker Johnson while trying to stop the ball off his own bowling.         
	Two balls later, Haddin became involved when he pointed his bat at the bowler, who had shaped to throw at the strikers end with the batsman standing in his crease.         
	The three players then got embroiled in a heated altercation at the end of the 118th over, with the 28-year-old from Barbados pointing at the Australia wicket-keeper over the shoulder of Johnson.         
	The Australia players pleaded guilty at an early stage and, under the provisions of the new code, and Match Referee Chris Broad decided that there is no need for a full hearing.         
	However, a hearing involving Benn was held at close of the second days play, after the spinner pleaded not guilty to the charges laid against him.         
	Broad handed down the punishment after looking at the video evidence of the incident. The hearing was attended by on-field umpires Ian Gould and Billy Bowden, third umpire Asad Rauf and fourth umpire Rod Tucker (who had laid the charges together). The hearing was also attended by West Indies team manager Joel Garner and captain Chris Gayle.         
	Commenting on his findings, Broad said: It was an incident which could have been avoided. No one likes to see cricketers pointing bats at their opponents or pushing each other away. It is not the sort of example that players should be setting at any time, least of all in a series which is being played in great spirit and being followed by millions around the world on television.         
	The decision to find Sulieman guilty of a Level 2 offence is indicative of the fact that conduct contrary to the spirit of the game is completely unacceptable. I hope he has learnt his lesson and will be careful in future.

                                                   Advani wins crown
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Pankaj Advani stamped his class over the three-ball baize game when he beat Peter Gilchrist of Singapore in the final of the Asian Billiards Championship to retain the continental crown at the PYC Gymkhana in Pune Sunday.         
	The under-21 snooker title went, as expected, to Zhang Anda of China who defeated N. Noppom Saegkham of Thailand 5-1 in a totally lop-sided final. In the billiards title-clash between two very accomplished players, Advani emerged victor with a 5-3 verdict, overturning a 2-3 deficit to win the Asian crown for the third time.

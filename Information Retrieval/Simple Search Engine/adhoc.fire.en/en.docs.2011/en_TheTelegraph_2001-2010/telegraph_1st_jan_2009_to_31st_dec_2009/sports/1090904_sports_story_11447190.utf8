The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tough draw for Jeev
                                                   Tough draw for Jeev
                      
	Sentosa: Jeev Milkha Singhs title defence just got tougher with Major champions Padraig Harrington and Ernie Els committing for this years Barclays Singapore Open, where both had finished runner-up last season.         
	Jeev, currently in Switzerland for the European Masters, will defend his title at the Sentosa Golf Club from October 29 to November 1 in the $5 million tournament, which remains the richest national Open in Asia.         
	Korean K J Choi and Darren Clarke from Northern Ireland will add further star appeal to the tournament, which for the first time is being joint-sanctioned by the Asian Tour and European Tour.         
	Harrington and Els are ranked ninth and 20th in the world respectively, and finished tied for second place last weekend at The Barclays tournament in New York. They both missed easy birdie putts on the final hole of the 2008 Singapore Open that would have forced a play-off with Jeev.

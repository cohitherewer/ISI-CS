The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ian Chappell got it right
                                                   Ian Chappell got it right
                      
	Mohammed Ashrafuls removal as Bangladeshs captain has come within days of Ian Chappell telling The Telegraph that hed been saddled with a job he wasnt fit to handle.         
	Speaking in London, on the eve of the World T20 final, Ian had said: Hes been saddled with a job he probably isnt fit to do...         
	While assessing the Test captains of the day, the living legend had added: Bangladesh are a basket case and I dont think it would matter who captains them.         
	Theres no denying that the Bangladesh team has been underachieving, but many across our eastern border would still view that comment as rather uncharitable.         
	Bangladeshs selectors have, of course, taken the right step in elevating Mashrafe Mortaza, a victim of the Kolkata Knight Riders mismanagement during the IPLs second edition.         
	Actually, recent weeks have gone well for all from the region who were shabbily treated by the John Buchanan regime. Ajantha Mendis, for example, had a great World T20 and Angelo Mathew a dream-like semi-final (against the West Indies).         
	Then, late on Monday, Mortaza got the national captaincy.           LPS

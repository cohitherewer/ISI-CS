The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ECB confirms Aussie-Pak series in July
                                                   ECB confirms Aussie-Pak series in July
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Australia will play Pakistan in two Twenty20 Internationals and two Test matches in England from July 5 to 25 next year, according to the schedule announced by the ECB on Thursday.         
	England will then play a four-match Test Series against Pakistan from July 29 to August 30, and five ODIs and two Twenty20 Internationals.         
	The ECB also scrapped the 50-over format from its domestic calender for the 2010 season, claiming that the ICC will review the future of ODIs after the 2011 World Cup.         
	The revised domestic structure, finalised after a 12-month discussion with the first-class counties, now comprise four-day matches, enhanced Twenty20 competitions and 40-over leagues, which would be played only on Sundays.

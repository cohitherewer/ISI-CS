                                                     ICC plans to try Sachin formula

	London: The International Cricket Council (ICC) is now planning to split one-day International (ODI) matches into two innings of 25 overs each, an idea mooted by Sachin Tendulkar earlier this month.         
	According to an ICC spokesman, the trial will be first conducted at the domestic level and the results discussed by the cricket committee before recommending it to its executive board for implementation at the international level.         
	In order to spice up the one-day format, Sachin had proposed that every team play two innings of 25 overs each, and ICC cricket manager Dave Richardson said the governing body might soon conduct a trial.         
	I quite like that idea, I believe South Africa may try something along those lines, Richardson told BBC Radio.         
	This might work in day-night cricket where one team has to bat in the day and the other at night. It provides something different and reduces the effects on the team which loses the toss and has to bat first on a damp wicket, for example, he said.         
	Even though Tendulkar aired his view earlier this month, Richardson said the idea had popped up in the past as well and came up for discussion at annual meeting of the ICC cricket committee in May. One-day cricket is already facing tough challenge from Twenty20 and the England and Wales Cricket Board scrapped Friends Provident Trophy, the only 50-over domestic tournament, in favour of a Twenty20 event.         
	Richardson, however, made it clear that such an experiment has to be conducted at the domestic level before pushing it into international cricket.         
	If it has been put on trial successfully at domestic level, it may give the trial to give it the go-ahead at international level, he said.         
	The ICC has been proactive with ideas and innovations, like the powerplays. The idea of the super-sub wasnt as successful and got rid of quite quickly. One of the criticisms was that we trialled things at international as opposed to domestic level.         
	Our tactics going forward are member countries trial changes first domestically and if they are successful, then we can take them on board at the international level, Richardson said.         
	The ICC cricket committee will discuss the result of the experiment when it meets next year.         
	Richardson, however, is concerned that splitting it into two innings would mean less centuries as batsmen would have less overs to bat.         
	I dont necessarily like the idea of playing two matches of 25 overs each with the openers batting again. The charm of one-day cricket is seeing someone batting at four and scoring a good hundred, Richardson said.         
	If you bat in the middle-order of a Twenty20 or a new 25-over innings, youre not to get much of an opportunity to hit three figures, one downside of the Twenty20 game, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Three Australians set to make debut
                                                     Three Australians set to make debut
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Australia captain Ricky Ponting with the ICC Test Championship Mace                           
	Calcutta/Johannesburg: Australia, thirsting for revenge after their home defeat by South Africa, could include three debutants in the first Test starting on Thursday.         
	Opening batsman Phillip Hughes, all-rounder Marcus North and swing bowler Ben Hilfenhaus may all feature alongside pacemen Peter Siddle and Doug Bollinger, who are both on their first tours.         
	Australia have omitted specialist spinners Nathan Hauritz and Bryce McGain and will choose two from North, Hilfenhaus and all-rounder Andrew McDonald.         
	Its going to be a great challenge, in particular for the younger guys, captain Ricky Ponting told a news conference on Wednesday ahead of a three-match series that will determine which of the two teams top the world rankings.         
	We played some very good cricket at times in Australia but not enough to put a very good South African side away.         
	Pontings team have been the dominant force in world cricket for more than five years but South Africa became the first side in 16 years to win a Test series in Australia when they triumphed 2-1 last month.         
	Experienced batsman Mike Hussey said Australia must raise their game.         
	South Africa won the 50-50 moments throughout the series and we will need to play good, hard, uncompromising cricket for longer periods, said Hussey.         
	We need to bat for longer and build bowling partnerships for longer too.         
	Skipper Graeme Smith knows it will be tough for South Africa to repeat their recent victory over Australia.         
	The expectation and the hype is great, theres a terrific feeling around the country, he said.         
	Its great to see the game in such a good light and to see all the crowds giving a good vibe but we are focusing on keeping emotions out of the game and making sure we play better cricket than Australia.         
	We feel capable of doing it but it will take a lot of hard work.         
	Ponting expects a lively pitch at the Wanderers Stadium.         
	Its pretty much all for the faster bowlers here, particularly swing bowlers, given the pitch is a bit soft and the (cloudy) skies that are around, he said.         
	South Africa will field the same team that played in the three Tests in Australia, with vice-captain Ashwell Prince omitted despite having recovered from his broken hand.         
	Smith added that, if his team gained the No. 1 ranking by beating Australia again, it would be reflection of the results over the past 18 months and a reward for the hard work that had been put in.         
	It is a sign of the success we have had if we get there (to No. 1). We can basically look ourselves in the face and say we deserve to be there. We have won on every continent over the last period of time and I think it is a really satisfying feeling for any team and for any player.         
	It would be a good, satisfying feeling to be number one and it would be a sign of our success, said Smith.         
	Teams         
	South Africa: Graeme Smith (capt), Neil McKenzie, Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, A.B. de Villiers, J.P. Duminy, Mark Boucher, Morne Morkel, Paul Harris, Dale Steyn, Makhaya Ntini.         
	Australia (from): Phillip Hughes, Simon Katich, Ricky Ponting (capt), Michael Hussey, Michael Clarke, Marcus North, Brad Haddin (wk), Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle, Doug Bollinger, Ben Hilfenhaus, Andrew McDonald.

	Farmingdale: Tiger Woods swung away on the 18th tee on Friday, watched his ball fly into a bunker on the way to another bogey, and turned away in disgust. Little came easily for the worlds No. 1 player after the resumption of the rain-delayed US Open.         
	A couple of amateurs, meanwhile, had less trouble than most navigating soggy Bethpage Black.         
	Woods gave back four shots over his final four holes to finish his opening round at 4-over 74, placing him five shots behind a group that included US amateur standout and former Virginia Tech player Drew Weaver, who finished with a 1-under 69 in whats already the third major of his career.         
	I was even par with four to go, Woods said. I mean, its not like I was hitting it all over the place. I was hitting a lot of good shots. Unfortunately, I just didnt finish off the round the way I needed to.         
	So unlike what happened on his last trip to Bethpage in 2002, this US Open wont be a victory after leading from start to finish for Woods.         
	After a double-bogey and two bogeys in his final four holes, hes already got some work to do. The question is, when will he resume?         
	Woods side of the field will not start its second round until Saturday, when more rain is expected to pound the waterlogged course. The US Open hasnt had a 72-hole Monday finish since 1983, but any significant interruption in play over the coming days would likely ensure that no champion will be crowned on Sunday.         
	Bethpage was playable again Friday, with crews having drained much of the water that pounded the Black course throughout Thursday.         
	I think were all a bit shocked at how well the golf course has held up, really, said Graeme McDowell, part of the early group finishing at 69.         
	But the course doesnt seem like it could take much more rain, and with another 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) or more possible Saturday, the USGA is already bracing for a Monday finish.         
	And yes, Tuesday has even been discussed. Thats possible, USGA executive director David Fay said.         
	Theres one advantage to extra rain, Woods said. Itll keep mud off the balls, and since the USGA positively forbids the lift, clean and place policy seen at many other events, mud will be an issue as the course gets tackier and drier.         
	Its only going to get worse, unless we get more rain, said Woods, who lauded Bethpages condition for Fridays play and headed back to the driving range after finishing his round. If it dries out a little more, this is going to get interesting.         
	Weaver knows hes going to be waiting around for a while before the second round begins. He can deal with that. Weaver was just leaving a Virginia Tech classroom building on that fateful day in 2007, just as someone began a shooting rampage that left 32 people dead. The deranged student assassin then took his own life.         
	That summer, Weaver won the British Amateur, earning him a spot in the British Open. He played the Masters last year as well, and now, he found himself on the top of a leaderboard at a major championship.         
	Im very fortunate in that aspect, Weaver said. Ive gotten a good amount of experience and although I havent really made a cut, I feel like Ive played a lot of good rounds. Everythings coming together and Im off to a good start. (AP)

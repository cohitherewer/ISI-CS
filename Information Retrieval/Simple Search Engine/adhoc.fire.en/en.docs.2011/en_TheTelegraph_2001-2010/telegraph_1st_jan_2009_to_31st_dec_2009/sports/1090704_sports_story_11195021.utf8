                                                     Siblings not game for sentiment
            Alyson Rudd            Serena Williams                           
	London: You might as well try to describe the colour of infinity as analyse a Grand Slam tournament final between the Williams sisters.         
	Of all the remarkable elements connected to Saturdays showpiece, one of the most disconcerting is how Venus and Serena calmly handle the ultimate dilemma; to love and respect your sibling but want to defeat them while the world watches.         
	Would it not be all so much easier if they did not face each other? Apparently not. I definitely wanted her to win, Venus, 29, said after her younger sisters semi-final victory over Elena Dementieva, of Russia. Its like if she didnt win or if I didnt win, then the dream doesnt come true that were both playing in the final. So I definitely want to play against her.         
	Serena, 27, said: The more we play, the better it gets. This is what we dreamt of when we were growing up. I wanted her to win and she wanted me to win.         
	It has all come down to a fascinating encounter. This will be the fourth time that they have met in a Wimbledon final, but, perhaps more significantly, neither has the edge.         
	In 20 meetings, they have each won 10 times, which in Serenas words make Saturdays final super-intense. Venus said: It will be a tipping-point match. I do like to be ahead, even though shes my sister.                   Venus Williams       
	After their 6-1, 6-2 victory over Cara Black and Liezel Huber Friday to reach the womens doubles final  which they contest Saturday, a few hours after their singles final  the Williams sisters were icily dismissive of questions about how their relationship alters as they prepare for meeting in a final.         
	That might imply that they are having some difficulty coping, but in fact they are merely bored with the assumption that they struggle with the dilemma. It was patently clear that their relationship does not need to be somehow put on hold  as the questions flooded in about the craziness of facing a sibling, they would turn and grin at each other and giggle at the same moment.         
	But how does it work? How do they want the best for each other, to see the other win and then suddenly want to inflict a defeat?         
	Venus said it is real easy to separate the concepts of sister and rival when you get a serve at about 127mph and it comes back as a winner. You soon realise youre playing against an awesome player and you better really get ready. So thats exactly when you separate it.         
	The dilemma does exist, however, for Richard, their father, who will not be watching Saturday.         
	Serena didnt play well, he admitted after her three-set victory over Dementieva on Thursday.         
	Venus said of her sister: I know that shes there for me ... even if were 10,000 miles apart.         
	Saturday they will be on the same court and, albeit briefly, very apart.

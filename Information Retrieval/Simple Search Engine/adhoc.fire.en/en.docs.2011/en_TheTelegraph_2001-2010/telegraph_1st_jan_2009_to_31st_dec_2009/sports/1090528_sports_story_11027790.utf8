The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | KKR failed as a unit: Ishant
                                                     KKR failed as a unit: Ishant
                  Ishant                     
	New Delhi: Kolkata Knight Riders pacer Ishant Sharma Wednesday refused to blame captain Brendon McCullum or coach John Buchanan for their debacle in the recently concluded second edition Indian Premier League (IPL). But he said the fact was that the team failed to deliver as a unit.         
	Knight Riders suffered the humiliation of losing eight matches in a row under the leadership of McCullum, who succeeded Sourav Ganguly, and Australia coach John Buchanan but Ishant said it would have met the same fate under anyone.         
	Whoever would have been our captain and coach but the fact was that we failed to deliver as a team In the IPL. The captain is as good as his team, he said on the sidelines of a function.         
	Asked to compare Sourav and McCullum, the 20-year-old said: They are different types of captain and both have different ways of handling the pressure.         
	On the personal front, Ishant admitted the second edition IPL was the most difficult phase of his career. I have never seen my side losing so many matches at a stretch like what happened in the IPL. It was certainly the toughest phase of my cricket career so far.         
	Since the day I started playing cricket, I have never seen my side losing so many close matches for such a long period. But I think, it was a learning experience for the whole team as well, the lanky bowler said.         
	However, the Delhi-man is now ready to shrug off the IPL-hangover before going to the ICC World Twenty20 Championship in England. He went on to dismiss speculation that the 37-day cash-awash event had tired the Indian players.         
	I dont think that there will be fatigue factor during the Twenty20 World Cup. We are professional cricketers and are prepared to play that much cricket. We know how to look after ourselves, Ishant said.         
	The T20 cricket is all about momentum. If we continue with the right momentum like the team did last time, India can defend the title, he said. (PTI)

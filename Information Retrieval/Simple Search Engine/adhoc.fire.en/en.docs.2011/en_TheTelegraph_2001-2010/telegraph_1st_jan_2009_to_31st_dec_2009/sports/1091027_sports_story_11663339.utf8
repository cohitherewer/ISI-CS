                                                   Revenge on Younis mind
  - Pakistan gearing up for series vs NZ Afridi wants a break from Test cricket                             
	Karachi: Younis Khan will be seeking redemption when he leads Pakistan against New Zealand in a limited-over series, starting next week in the United Arab Emirates.         
	Pakistan went down to New Zealand in the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy, a loss which almost cost him his career.         
	New Zealand did very well in the Champions Trophy and I hope we could avenge our defeat by playing as a team against them, Younis said here Monday.         
	After the three ODIs and the Twenty20 matches in the UAE, the teams will fly to New Zealand for a Test series. Younis said New Zealands strength was teamwork, and Pakistanis need to learn that from them.         
	If you look at the New Zealand squad, it is one of the three teams along with Sri Lanka and Australia, who play well as a unit, Younis told reporters.         
	The (playing) conditions will be similar for both teams in the UAE. So there will be no advantage or disadvantage for any team. What matters is how well we play as a team, he said.         
	Chief selector Iqbal Qasim advised Younis to concentrate on his individual performance in the series as it was imperative for the captain to lead by example.         
	We dont want to put any pressure on him but now that Younis has come out of his recent problems and controversies, he should try to get back to his old batting form, Qasim said.         
	The former Test spinner also made it clear that unless a captain scored consistently, his authority diminishes.         
	No matter how good a captain any player might be, he has to supplement that with good individual performances. Younis is a senior batsman of the team, and he has led from the front in the past, he remarked.         
	Meanwhile, Shahid Afridi, a senior member of the team, has asked the selectors not to consider him for Test matches until next years World Twenty20, since he wants to concentrate on the one-day and Twenty20 formats.         
	There is a lot of international cricket being played these days, and I think it is better if I focus on these two forms of the game in the period leading up to the World Cup, Afridi said.         
	Afridi, who last played a Test in July 2006 in England, said the next two years were very important for Pakistan cricket with the Twenty20 and 50-over World Cups lined up.         
	I would love to see our team winning both competitions and I feel we have the potential to do that, the all- rounder said.         
	Afridi said not playing Test matches would help him stay fresh for the Twenty20 and ODIs. He has played 285 ODIs, compared to just 26 Tests in a career which began in 1997. Selectors have already omitted him from the Test squad announced for the tour of New Zealand.         
	Afridi dismissed reports of differences with Younis. Both of us go a long way and we respect each other. I have always supported him as player and captain and I will continue to do that in future as well, he said.         
	Former team manager Yawar Saeed, too, denied masterminding a campaign to replace Younis with Afridi.         
	Senior batsman Mohammed Yousuf, on the other hand, is keen to score big on the tour of New Zealand and Australia, reckoning this could be his last tour to those countries.         
	I am 35 and have had a long career, and this might be my last tour to New Zealand and Australia. So I am keen to make a lot of runs against them this time, Yousuf said.         
	The stylist batsman has been named in both the Test and one-day squads that would first play an ODI series in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and then tour New Zealand for three Tests. Pakistan team will then fly out to Australia from New Zealand in mid-December to play three Tests and five onedayers.         
	The squad for the tour of Australia will be announced later on.         
	Ive a challenging time ah-ead, because I know if I score lots of runs, it would have a positive effect on the team.         
	My main regret in my long career is that we have not been able to win a Test series in Australia, even though I even captained the team there in one Test when Inzamam-ul Haq was injured, Yousuf said.         
	Yousuf, who has a batting average of 33 in six Tests in Australia and a much better average of 69 in five Tests in New Zealand, is at present Pakistans senior most player with 82 Test appearances.         
	Yousuf said it was always a challenge to do well in Australia as they were the best team in the world.         
	But it is not easy even in New Zealand, where the ball seams around a lot. The cold weather is a challenge as well, he said.         
	Yousuf, who made a comeback to the team this year after joining the Indian Cricket League, said he was definitely looking to play the 2011 World Cup, but had realised long time ago that one must not look too far ahead.         
	It is all in Gods hand. One does not know where one will be the next day. So right now, Im focusing on the next series which is in New Zealand and Australia.         
	I definitely want to play in the next World Cup but that will only happen if I remain fit and keep scoring runs, Yousuf said. (AGENCIES)

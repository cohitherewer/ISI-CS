The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Amazing it came after Sachins 17,000, says Amol
                                                                                                                                   Amazing it came after Sachins 17,000, says Amol
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Guwahati: Amol Muzumdar on Friday became the highest run-getter in Ranji Trophy going past Amarjit Kaypees mark of 7623.         
	The Assam captain, however, could not stop his team from losing to Rajasthan by 95 runs in their Plate Group A campaign opener at the NF Railway Stadium.         
	Chasing 296 for victory, Assam managed just 200. Pankaj Singh took seven for 64.         
	Its amazing that I have achieved the milestone a day after Sachin Tendulkar crossed 17,000 ODI runs, Muzumdar said, referring to Sachins 175 in a losing cause in Hyderabad against Australia Thursday night.         
	Both Sachin and Muzumdar have played together for Mumbai and the man-of-the-moment is a big fan of the iconic batsman. Muzumdar shifted to Assam this season.         
	Muzumdar was also all praise for Sachin. He is a very special person in my life. I draw inspiration from him and it is great that he is scripting records at the international arena at will, he said.         
	Muzumdar felt there could not have been a better day to set the record as batting was very difficult. He became the highest Ranji run-getter after scoring 25.

                                                   Sachin credits coach Kirsten
    - The secret of success is letting players play their natural game                             
	Chennai: Sachin Tendulkar credits coach Gary Kirsten with helping the team become a force in world cricket.         
	India won their first Test series in New Zealand in four decades this week, which was also their third successive Test series victory since defeating top-ranked Australia in November.         
	The secret of this success is letting players play their natural game, Tendulkar said on Friday. That can only happen if the atmosphere is good and the mind is free of any kind of pressure. Its the case of natural instincts taking over and that can be credited to Gary (Kirsten). The team environment is allowing players to play their natural game. Thats probably the secret.         
	Tendulkar, the worlds highest run-getter in Test and one-day cricket, was the second highest scorer behind Gautam Gambhir in the Test series with 344 runs.         
	Former South African opener Kirsten took over from Greg Chappell last year and has helped the Indian team improve their performance, earning the respect of the players for his quiet approach, following a turbulent period under the Australian.         
	Meanwhile, Harbhajan Singh believes India have what it takes to beat the best anywhere in the world.         
	This team is capable of winning anywhere. If we play to our potential, stick to the basics and focus on the job, we have the team that can beat anyone anywhere, Harbhajan has said.         
	India have yet to win a Test series in Australia, although they squared a close series 1-1 in 2004 and lost a controversial Test series 1-2, before winning a tri-series there last year. India won their first Test in South Africa in 2006 and emerged as surprise winners of the inaugural World Twenty20 there two years ago.         
	The 28-year-old bowler said winning matches overseas has made a big difference.         
	The guys are confident, confident of performing in any conditions, said Harbhajan, the sides No.1 spinner since Anil Kumble retired last year. I think this team can win anywhere  South Africa, Australia  we have got the ability to exploit any conditions.         
	Zaheer has bowled beautifully to give India early breakthroughs, Harbhajan said of Zaheer Khan, the left-arm pace spearhead.         
	Ishant is still raw, and he needs to be focused. He is a talented bowler, he added about Ishant Sharma, Zaheers new-ball partner.         
	Harbhajan, who has taken 330 Test wickets and over 200 one-day wickets, avoided getting drawn into the debate of whether the team is Indias best ever yet.         
	I wont want to compare between eras, said Harbhajan. But a batting line-up of (Virender) Sehwag, Gautam (Gambhir), (Rahul) Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar, (Vangipurappu) Laxman, Yuvraj (Singh), Id say it is one of the best. Its an exciting team.

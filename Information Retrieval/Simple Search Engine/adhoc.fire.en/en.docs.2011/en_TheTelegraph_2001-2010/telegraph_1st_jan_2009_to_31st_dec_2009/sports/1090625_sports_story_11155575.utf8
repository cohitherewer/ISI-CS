	Johannesburg: South Africa have to overcome the talent of Brazil and their understandable feeling of inferiority if they are to carry the hopes of a nation and reach the Confederations Cup final.         
	Like any side going up against the record five-time World Cup winners, South Africa know they are as good as beaten if they take the field for Thursdays semi-final match star-struck by former world player of the year Kaka and striker Robinho.         
	The likes of burly central defender Matthew Booth cannot match the South Americans when it comes to skill, so Bafana Bafana is relying on raucous home support to rouse them to a performance of greater intensity than their opponents can muster.         
	We dont want to get carried away putting these guys up on a pedestal, South Africa goalkeeper Rowen Fernandez said. Yes, theyre idols to millions and we respect them all as footballers, but were going to go out there Thursday and compete on the pitch. Its 11 versus 11, obviously, and Im sure Matthew is dying to get stuck into Robinho and give Kaka a piece of his mind.         
	Fernandez and Booth are among four players in the South African squad that beat Brazil at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, but an under-23 tournament is quite another thing compared to a full international like Thursdays at Ellis Park.         
	Playing for a draw against them isnt going to do us any good, South Africa midfielder Teko Modise said. Theyre going to allow us space and time to attack them and to play and well look to utilise that. We really want to play our hearts out and attack. We need to score as many goals as we can because we all know theyre capable of scoring many.         
	Brazil have racked up 10 goals in group games against World Cup holders Italy, African champions Egypt and the United States, compared to the two South Africa managed in a significantly easier group. But by the same token, we might look on the positive side and say they also conceded goals, South Africa striker Katlego Mashego said.         
	The South Americans have scored more goals than anyone else, two more than European champion Spain.         
	With Luis Fabiano, Robinho and Kaka exchanging positions fluidly in attack, Booth and his colleagues could be in for a torrid time.         
	Even so, Brazil will be without Juan after the key defender was ruled out for the remainder of the tournament with a left thigh injury and the players were not taking anything for granted ahead of a match they are overwhelming favourites to win.         
	Tradition doesnt win or lose matches, Luis Fabiano said. In a semi-final, you have to be careful. To make the final we need to enter the match with the same concentration and motivation that we had against Italy. Its going to be a difficult match. They are playing at home and will give their lives against Brazil.         
	Meanwhile, South Africa have been hit by a knee injury to striker Bernard Parker. Parker, who scored both of the teams goals at the tournament, pulled out of Wednesdays training session at Rand Stadium and will have tests Thursday to see if he can play.

	London: The final line-up of teams for next years World Cup in South Africa was settled on Wednesday after six drama-charged playoffs on three different continents.         
	France, with a controversial extra-time goal, joined Slovenia, Greece and Portugal as the last four qualifiers from Europe. Algeria snatched the last African spot while the World Cups inaugural champions Uruguay grabbed the 32nd and final berth.         
	France squeezed into the finals after a contentious late goal from William Gallas despite failing to beat Ireland in Paris.         
	Unlike Ireland, Slovenia managed to clinch an upset by knocking out Russia who paid a heavy price for not wrapping up the first leg on Saturday when they allowed Slovenia a late goal in a 2-1 win.         
	Russias late lapse proved costly in Maribor as Zlatko Dedic scored the only goal just before the break.         
	That was enough to give Slovenia a 1-0 win and the tie on the away goals rule as they reached the World Cup finals for the second time since joining the Fifa as an independent nation in 1992.         
	Russia finished with nine men after substitute Alexander Kerzhakov and Yuri Zhirkov were sent off. The defeat also denied Russias Dutch coach Guus Hiddink a fourth appearance in the finals after coaching his native Netherlands in the 1998 World Cup, then South Korea in 2002 and Australia in 2006.         
	Greece, held to a 0-0 draw by Ukraine in Athens on Saturday, went to Donetsk as underdogs, but stunned the home team by winning 1-0 with a first-half goal from Dimitris Salpigidis.         
	Striker Giorgos Samaras supplied the pass in the 32nd minute for Salpigidis who sent Greece to the World Cup for only the second time after their debut appearance in the US in 1994.         
	Coach Otto Rehhagel, who took charge of Greece in 2001 and steered them to the 2004 European title, will be involved in the World Cup for the first time in his 50-year career.         
	Portugal clinched their place 2-0 on aggregate, following up Saturdays 1-0 home win over Bosnia with another 1-0 win thanks to midfielder Raul Meireles who silenced a raucous 15,000 home fans in a cauldron of the Bilino Polje stadium after 56 minutes.         
	Algeria booked their place after beating archrivals Egypt 1-0 in neutral Sudan to win a tense sudden-death playoff, defender Antar Yahia scoring five minutes before half-time with a stunning half-volley.         
	The match was littered with fouls, but despite the high stakes, it was completed without major incident.         
	A heavy police presence around the stadium and on the streets of Khartoum also ensured little crowd trouble afterwards. Uruguay advanced 2-1 on aggregate after their 1-1 home draw to Costa Rica in the second leg of the South American/Concacaf playoff.         
	Substitute striker Sebastian Abreu gave the South Americans the lead with 20 minutes to go at the Centenario, where they won their first World Cup in 1930, before Costa Rica captain Walter Centeno equalised three minutes later.         
	The draw was enough for Uruguay to advance. The draw for the finals takes place in Cape Town on December 4. Many of the big boys of world football would have breathed a sigh of relief at the end of the last day of qualifiers. Teams like France, and Portugal.         
	Many observers had been critical of coach Carlos Queiroz but several changed their tune after Portugal clinched their place in next years finals in South Africa. How this Portugal team has grown.         
	In a tough match, a boiling atmosphere, on a terrible pitch, they showed maturity. There was soul, concentration ... a true team, said a sports daily.         
	Queiroz said he had accomplished a lifelong dream after a journey of many years.         
	The coach, in a previous spell in charge, had failed to lead Portugal to the 1994 World Cup.         
	The centre of Ljubljana was packed on Thursday as thousands of soccer fans gathered to greet the Slovenia team which beat Russia in a playoff to qualify.           (REUTERS)

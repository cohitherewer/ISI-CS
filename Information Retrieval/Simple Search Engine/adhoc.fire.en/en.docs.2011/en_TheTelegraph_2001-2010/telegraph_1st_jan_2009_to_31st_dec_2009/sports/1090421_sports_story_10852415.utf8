                                                   Mumbai FC set to go for pay cut
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Recession has finally hit Indian football. The Mumbai Football Club team management on Monday told the footballers of the club that there could be a sharp cut in the players salary for the next season.         
	According to sources, Mumbai FC, a team launched by the Essel Group in 2007, are set to reduce the budget for the season and have asked the footballers and some members of the coaching and support staff to accept lesser salaries.         
	The footballers were called in a meeting and were categorically told by the management that the company was not in a position to continue spending the same amount of money for the team as it did last season, sources said.         
	A final decision, however, will only be taken on Thursday.         
	Mumbai FC were launched with lot of fanfare in June 2007 and were touted as Mumbais first community based football team. While British coach David Booth was made the chief coach, former India goalkeeper Henry Menezes was roped in from Mahindra United as the general manager.         
	They also recruited some big names of Indian football like Abhishek Yadav, Khalid Jamil and Kalyan Choubey to strengthen the side. The club finished a modest seventh in the just concluded 12-team I-League.         
	Mumbai FC are not the only team from the western metropolis to plan a budget cut for the next season because of the recession. Mahindra United, which spent heavily on players recruitments for the last two seasons, has already decided to cut down their budget by 15 per cent.         
	The Mahindra management has also announced that it will recruit only 27 players for the next season. Normally, all I-League clubs have a pool of 35 players for the entire season.

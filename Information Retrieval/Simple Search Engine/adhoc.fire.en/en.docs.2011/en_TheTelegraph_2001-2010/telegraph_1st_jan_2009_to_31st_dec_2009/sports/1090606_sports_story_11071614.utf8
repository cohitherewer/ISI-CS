                                                     Boys not overawed by India: Akram Khan
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Akram Khan                           
	Nottingham: Mohammed Akram Khan, under whose captaincy Bangladesh won the 1997 ICC Trophy and qualified for the 1999 World Cup, is wearing a selectors hat nowadays.         
	Its in his capacity as a selector that Akram is in England with the Mohammed Ashrafuls.         
	Im on the other side of the fence... This role too is quite challenging, Akram told The Telegraph.         
	Asked about Bangladeshs prospects in the World T20, Akram said: The team is confident... Lets see... The nature of T20 is such that one over can change everything... Fancied teams may end up losing, lesser-rated ones could win... Its so difficult to predict...         
	Akram, incidentally, is the explosive Tamim Iqbals uncle. He has so much potential, but should be consistent... The team will be relying on him for a good start.         
	What about Team India?         
	Its strong, but I dont think our boys are overawed... Theyre determined to give the World T20 their best shot, was Akrams reply.         
	Back home, Akram (now 40) has a flourishing family business  a bus service between Dhaka and Chittagong and gas stations.

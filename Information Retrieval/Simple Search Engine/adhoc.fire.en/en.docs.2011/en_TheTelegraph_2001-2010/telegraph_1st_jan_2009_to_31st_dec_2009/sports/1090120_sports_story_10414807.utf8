                                                   Helpless Seppi becomes Federers first victim
    - Australian Open 
  -   Jankovic, Ivanovic enter Second Round                             
	Melbourne: Roger Federer took the first step towards his record-tying 14th Grand Slam title with a 6-1, 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 victory Monday over Andreas Seppi at the Australian Open.         
	Federer, seeking to match Pete Samprass mark, was at his best on the big points on the opening day when most favourites avoided upsets. However, it wasnt easy for even the top players.         
	He is a very tough customer, he played really well, Federer said of the 35th-ranked Seppi. I think I played well, too. I had to.         
	Serbias Ana Ivanovic, the womens runner-up last year, had 10 mistakes in the first five games but managed to advance with a 7-5, 6-3 victory over 107th-ranked Julia Goerges, who was even more erratic.         
	Top-seed Jelena Jankovic, short on practice after illness hampered preparations for her pursuit of a first Grand Slam title, had 27 winners to four in her 6-1, 6-3 win over No. 104 Yvonne Meusburger.         
	The other Serbian star, defending mens champion Novak Djokovic, started strong but had to rally from service breaks in the last two sets  he was down 4-0 in the third  to oust Andrea Stoppini 6-2, 6-3, 7-5.         
	Seventh-seed Andy Roddick opened with a straight sets win over Bjorn Rehnquist, with fellow American Mardy Fish also winning against Samuel Gorth. Six other Americans made first-round exits: Robby Ginepri, John Isner, Robert Kendrick, Bobby Reynolds, Taylor Dent and Sam Querry.         
	Top-ranked Rafael Nadal has his first match Tuesday, which will also see both Serena and Venus Williams in action.         
	Second-ranked Federer is a huge fan favourite here, and the Rod Laver Arena was still packed when he went on court at 10 pm under perfect conditions. Camera flashes went off every time he hit a shot.         
	Whose house? Rogers house! one fan roared.         
	Federer, who has won three titles here, was clearly focused on proving that fan right, and he said hes feeling more confident now than he was before the US Open last year, when he claimed his 13th Grand Slam trophy.         
	The Swiss star fended off all 10 of Seppis break points. He had one stretch in the first set that had the fans gasping and left Seppi with a look that said: What can I do?         
	Federer ran off the last five games of the set, dropping only six points, and the ones that Seppi did win usually took at least two good shots. Twice on one point, Seppi sent up lobs that landed on the line. Federer backtracked to get the first back with a quick flick of the wrist, then got to the second, spun around and whipped a wicked forehand winner.         
	Things got tighter the rest of the match.         
	Seppi had a set point as Federer served at 5-6, 30-40 but missed the sideline with a backhand that the replay system showed was maybe a millimetre out. Federer went on to hold, then ran away from a 3-3 tie in the tiebreaker.         
	Another tiebreaker appeared to be looming in the final set.         
	Seppi fended off three match points while serving at 5-6. Federer set up another with a backhand volley winner, and Seppi sent a forehand long to end the match in 2 hours, 21 minutes.         
	Ivanovic lost the 2008 Australian final to Maria Sharapova, who is out with an injured shoulder, then won the French Open to take the top ranking midway through the year.         
	She had her share of glitches while facing Goerges for the first time, with the midday sun playing havoc with every serve toss at one end of the court. It didnt help that the German player was going for winners.         
	Jankovic had more trouble with the broiling daytime sun  temperatures reached 97 degrees  than Meusburger. The surface was so hot that Jankovic iced the soles of her shoes during changeovers.         
	Roddick was happy to be first up in Rod Laver Arena. He sped off in less than two hours, taking advantage of 31-year-old Swedish qualifier Rehnquist, whose style played right into Roddicks strengths. Roddick, looking sharp and trim, committed just 10 unforced errors in the 6-0, 6-2, 6-2 win.         
	Gilles Muller of Luxembourg overcame No. 27 Feliciano Lopez of Spain 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 4-6, 16-14 in a 4-hour, 23-minute match. (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies have a lot at stake
                                                   Aussies have a lot at stake
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A drawn series will be enough for Australia to retain the Ashes but there is more at stake for Ricky Pontings men when they take on England in one of Test crickets most famous, and enduring, rivalries  the No.1 position in the ICC Test rankings.         
	Only a series victory will ensure Australia hold on to the No.1 positon. A drawn series would see the Aussies drop to second place for the first time since the current rankings system was introduced in 2003.         
	Hosts England, currently with 101 ratings points, will slip to 99 ratings points. However, Andrew Strausss men could overtake Australia at the end of this series. But for that they will have to create history and win every Test, something which no English side have done in a series of five or more Tests since the start of the Ashes over a century ago.         
	On the present table, at third, behind Australia and South Africa, are India who last featured in Tests on their tour of New Zealand early this year.         
	In the Test rankings for batsmen and bowlers, India have four and three names, respectively, in the top-20.         
	Among batsmen, Gautam Gambhir continues to be the highest-ranked Indian at No.3.         
	Harbhajan Singh at No.6 leads the Indian presence on the bowlers list. Muttiah Muralidharan was the highest-ranked bowler.

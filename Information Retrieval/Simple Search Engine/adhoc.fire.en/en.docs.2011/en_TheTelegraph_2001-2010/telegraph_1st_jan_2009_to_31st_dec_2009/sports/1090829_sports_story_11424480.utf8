The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wenger slams Uefa decision
                                                   Wenger slams Uefa decision
            THE TIMES, LONDON                      
	Arsene Wenger launched a fierce attack Friday on Uefas decision to charge Eduardo da Silva with misconduct after his apparent dive in Arsenals win over Celtic in the Champions League play-off round.         
	The Croatia striker stands accused of deliberately seeking to deceive the referee in the second leg at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday and could be given a two-match ban when Uefas disciplinary committee meets to consider a verdict on Tuesday.         
	Wenger branded Uefas actions a complete disgrace and accused European footballs governing body of conducting a witch-hunt against Eduardo. While accepting that Arsenal should not have been given a penalty, the Frenchman remains adamant that Eduardo did not deliberately dive and believes he has been unfairly singled out for punishment because of the high-profile nature of the incident.         
	I find it a complete disgrace and unacceptable, and we will not accept the way Uefa treated this case for two reasons, he said. I believe that you can debate, was it a penalty or not? This charge implies that with intent and with a desire to cheat the referee, Eduardo did act. And it singles out a player in Europe to be a cheat, and that is not acceptable.

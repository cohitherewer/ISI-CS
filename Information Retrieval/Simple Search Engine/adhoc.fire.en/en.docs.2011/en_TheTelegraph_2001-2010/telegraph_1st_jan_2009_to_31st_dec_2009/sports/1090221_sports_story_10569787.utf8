The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Villa test for Chelsea today
                                                   Villa test for Chelsea today
                      
	London: Chelseas stuttering season starts afresh on Saturday when Guus Hiddink takes them to Aston Villa, with the improving Midlanders looking down from third spot in the Premier League at the fourth-placed Londoners.         
	That is not a situation owner Roman Abramovich envisaged when he recruited Luiz Felipe Scolari as manager before the start of the season.         
	Abramovich would hardly have considered the prospect of trailing leaders Manchester United by 10 points with 13 games remaining but that is the situation Chelsea are in after sacking Scolari last week.         
	New manager Hiddink, who took his first training session on Monday, will be expected to turn things round quickly, having been encouraged by the display in last weekends 3-1 FA Cup win at Watford.         
	Nicolas Anelka scored a hattrick to take his seasons tally to 20 but it was the contribution and demeanour of Didier Drogba that might turn out to be the most important development.         
	Drogba has been a peripheral figure for most of an injury-hit season, with Scolari saying he could not adjust his preferred 4-3-3 system in order to play him and Anelka as a twin strikeforce. When stand-in manager Ray Wilkins put the two together in the middle of the attack for the last 20 minutes at Watford, Chelsea took total control and both forwards were quick to talk up their fledgling partnership.         
	Chelsea certainly needed something to galvanise a team that appeared to be drifting in Scolaris last few weeks in charge.         
	Hiddinks first job is a tough one, though. Villas 3-1 FA Cup defeat at Everton last week was their first domestic loss in 16 matches and their only home defeat in the league came against Middlesbrough in November.         
	Defeat for Chelsea would open the door still further for United when they entertain Blackburn Rovers at Old Trafford in the evening game.         
	Arsenal host Sunderland .         
	Steven Gerrards hamstring is also likely to keep him out of Liverpools home game with Manchester City on Sunday when victory is essential if Rafa Benitezs second-placed side are to maintain their challenge for a first league title in 19 years.

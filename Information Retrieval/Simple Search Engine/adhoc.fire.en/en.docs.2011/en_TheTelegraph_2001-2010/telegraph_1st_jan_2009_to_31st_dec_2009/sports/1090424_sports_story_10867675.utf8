                                                     Whatever you do in life, youve got to go at it whole-heartedly: Adam
    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  Australian great says he hasnt missed playing for his country             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                    
	Cape Town: That age isnt a factor was proved once again, at Newlands on Wednesday, when 37-year-old Adam Gilchrist blasted an impact-creating 71 (off just 45 balls) against the Royal Challengers Bangalore.         
	Gilchrist, a one-time world record-holder for the maximum dismissals in Tests (he finished on 416) and still the most successful in ODIs (472), spoke to The Telegraph for half-an-hour at The Cullinan hotel on Thursday morning.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q Youre through with all forms of cricket, except the T20-driven IPL. How, then, were you able to play so superbly last evening?         
	A (Grins) Ive kept up my general fitness, purely as a lifestyle thing, not related to the IPL or anything... Having been a professional sportsman all my life, Id definitely like to maintain a certain level of fitness... As for cricket, except a one-off T20 game at the start of the season in Australia, I hadnt played any competitive match from the time I retired (March 2008) till coming to South Africa... Of course, like the rest, I worked hard at the Deccan Chargers camp in Centurion... The facilities were great and we had three warm-up games.         
	But you must have trained in Perth, before setting out for the IPL...         
	I did, yes... I did have sessions for batting and keeping. (After a pause) I felt a bit scratchy in our IPL opener, against the (Kolkata) Knight Riders, but felt great against the Royal Challengers.         
	Whats the motivation behind playing in the IPL?         
	Like a lot of people, I realise how big the IPL is... How big the T20 format is... T20 has made such an impact on the sport and the IPL has caught the imagination of the world... Ive always believed that, whatever you do in life, youve got to go at it whole-heartedly... Thats my approach to the IPL too... We, at the Chargers, were quite frustrated last year... Im not saying there wasnt enough commitment, but frustration did set in and we finished right at the bottom...         
	Was anything learnt from the IPLs inaugural edition?         
	The whole group has tried to learn... There have been changes... As a group, weve tried to improve... Im not making big predictions, but were determined to do well and, as important, have a good bond within the franchise. Nobody is short on motivation.         
	How many years more are you looking at?         
	Dont know, mate... Im contracted till next year... After that, lets see... Ill be looking at the enjoyment factor, Ill look at whether I warrant a place in the team and balance that up with non-cricket activities. At the moment, the IPL fits well into my life with regard to off-field activities and, second, my family.         
	Two wins in two matches... Surely, you couldnt have asked for a better start as the Chargers captain...         
	Yeah... Its the ideal beginning, but this is only the start and there are many dangerous teams in the competition. Weve set a high standard and the challenge is to maintain that for the next month.         
	Your Australia career ended 13 months ago. How has this period gone?         
	Ive been busy... Busier than Id ever thought I would be... Its nice that Im now able to organise my own schedule, instead of following the one dictated by cricket... Ive been able to spend quality time with the family (wife Mel and the kids).         
	What has kept you busier than youd ever thought you would be?         
	Ive been working with things around cricket... Worked with corporates... Have gone into small business ventures... Done some work for Channel Nine... Because of my love for cricket, Ill always be associated with it in one form or the other... I didnt walk away disappointed or something... I didnt leave all forms, except T20 at the franchise-level, with bitterness...         
	Have you missed playing for Australia?         
	Not for a moment... And, its not that an innings like yesterday would make me regret having chosen to retire when I did.         
	But the Australian team has been missing you...         
	(Grins) The Australian team is missing a number of great players whove quit in the past two years or so... However, my view is that the Australian team played well this season... There were times when they let go opportunities, but there were occasions when they fought back and won... That Australia won the recent Test series in South Africa showed theres no cause for concern... The retirements have brought Australia back to the field a little bit, but I have faith in our development programmes and the talent weve got.         
	Fair enough, but when could Australias domination resume, if at all?         
	Difficult to say... Not sure, dont have a crystal ball... What I do know is that the players are working their hardest under the leadership of (captain) Ricky Ponting and (coach) Tim Nielsen... Rickys approach is to improve in every training session... Thats the work ethic he follows and is getting others to follow. Irrespective of who plays, Im confident the Australians will always be competitive.         
	Didnt you quit somewhat prematurely?         
	No... Physically, I was fine then, but Id realised I was mentally falling a fraction of a second behind where I needed to be, both at nets and in the middle... Towards the end of your career, especially, the game is as much in the mind as it is physically. I was comfortable taking the decision I did... I did so after an honest, solid appraisal... Where I wanted to be, the time I needed to spend with the family and so on.         
	It seemed youd become touchy about criticism of your keeping...         
	On reflection, I may have been a little bit sensitive throughout my career... That couldve been because the batting took up so much of my focus... But, then, I dont hold grudges against anybody.         
	Today, how do you look back on your awesome career?         
	I consider myself fortunate that I played in an era when there were such great players like Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara and, within the Australian team, legends like Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath... It was exciting, good fun... Indeed, Ive got great memories.         
	Some words on your successor, Brad Haddin...         
	A very, very good cricketer... Hes going to serve Australia very well... The transition has been seamless, thanks to his enormous first-class experience.         
	Youve been an inspiration for the Mahendra Singh Dhonis and the Brendon McCullums... What would you say?         
	A wonderful compliment, really... Its a nice thought that my legacy is that Ive inspired cricketers... Actually, because of one-day cricket, my player-type had already been developing and I and some like me just gave it the push... Today, there are teams having batsmen who keep... Depends on the balance they want and the formula they wish to follow.         
	Are you disappointed that dropped catches or missed stumpings get noticed more than the actual dismissals?         
	(Grins) Thats the reality... You could have a great day behind the stumps, but nobody may notice... On other days, you could get five catches without really having kept well, but that day gets noticed... You need to be mentally strong.         
	John Buchanan has been much in the news of late. How was he in the Australia dressing room?         
	I loved him... John had such a big influence on my career... Hes a great thinker, but can often be misunderstood... I havent spoken to him about the multiple leaders bit, but you do have multiple leaders in any set-up... Theres somebody at the top, but that person has leadership groups around him... Knowing John, hed be the first to admit that something planned by him hasnt worked... From my experience, I know there used to be good reasons behind any idea coming from John.         
	The last one: Your sixes in the IPL are going to help mentally and physically challenged children...         
	Yes, the proposal came from one of the brands in Australia... Each six will benefit one child, wholl get a modified bike... The bikes, I think, would each cost $ (Aus.) 1,000... Theyll be given to an organisation called Freedom Wheels... Im happy doing charity, its a way of giving something back to society.

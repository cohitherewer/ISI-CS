The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Board to pray for a poor rating!
                                                                                                                       7                                      Board to pray for a poor rating!
    - Unfit report from Match Referee will pose major problems for delhi           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) must be praying that Match Referee Alan Hurst, a former quick who did duty for Australia, would rate the disgraceful Kotla pitch as poor and not unfit.         
	Should that be so, then Delhi would escape suspension. If Hursts verdict is unfit and the International Cricket Council (ICC)s cricket committee chairman Clive Lloyd concurs, then a ban of between 12 and 24 months will be slapped.         
	That would have massive repercussions as the Kotla is to host four matches in the 2011 World Cup, the first of which (South Africa versus the West Indies) is scheduled for February 24. The last, India against The Netherlands, is on March 9.         
	Clearly, the BCCI has no choice but to hope that the Match Referees report says the pitch was poor... If the word unfit is used, then theres a major problem for the BCCI and Delhi, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Sunday evening, the source added: Lloyd apart, the ICCs general manager (cricket), Dave Richardson, and Chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle would come into the picture if Hurst gives the pitch an unfit label...         
	If it comes to that, the BCCI is bound to use its financial clout to try and limit the damage. That, of course, would place ICC vice-president Sharad Pawar in an awkward position.         
	Incidentally, neither poor nor unfit were mentioned in Hursts statement to the media. His report to the ICC, supposed to be confidential, will follow.         
	The BCCI prides itself on selling rights for millions of dollars, at the drop of a hat, but hardly pays enough attention to matters that ought to be given priority.         
	Given the unprofessionalism that exists, its perhaps a miracle that only two ODIs, hosted by the BCCI, have had to be abandoned. The first was in Indore, 12 years ago, involving the same teams.         
	Disbanding the grounds and pitches committee with immediate effect is nothing more than a way of deflecting some of the heat. Nobody sees it as a concrete step forward.         
	Shashank Manohar, the BCCI president, and secretary N.Srinivasan wont be sleeping well for the next few days, at least.         
	Footnote: Its ironical that the Daljits got the boot less than a fortnight after the Board doubled their monthly salaries, to Rs 40,000.  
	PENALTIES FOR POOR   OR UNFIT PITCHES  The penalties for pitches or outfields rated as ldquo;poor rdquo; or ldquo;unfit rdquo;, as approved by the International Cricket Council Board on the recommendation of the Chief Executives rsquo; Committee, are as follows:  a) In respect of pitches or outfields rated as ldquo;poor rdquo;:     First occasion mdash; A warning and/or a fine not exceeding $15,000 together with appropriate remedial action. 
      Second or further occasions within a period of 5 years of the previous finding mdash; A fine not exceeding $30,000.     b) In respect of pitches and outfields rated as ldquo;unfit rdquo;:     First occasion mdash; A suspension of the venue rsquo;s international status for a period of between 12 and 24 months together with a directive for appropriate remedial action and the need for prior ICC re-accreditation as an international venue.       Second or further occasion within a period of 5 years of the previous finding of ldquo;substandard rdquo; i.e. ldquo;poor or unfit rdquo; mdash; A suspension of the venue rsquo;s international status for a period of between 24 and 36 months together with a directive for appropriate remedial action and the need for prior ICC re-accreditation as an international venue.     Note: Guidelines for rating of Test pitches:   The categories for the rating of pitches and outfields should be reduced to four: Good, Average, Poor and Unfit   A pitch for Test matches that does not allow any form of assistance to the bowler should be categorized as ldquo;poor rdquo;.

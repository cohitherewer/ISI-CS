The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Eden to host four matches
                                                   Eden to host four matches
    - Dalmiya and Co. play it safe by opting for one India plus three option           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	Calcutta: Eden Gardens, which hosted the 1987 World Cup final and a semi-final in 1996, will stage one India match and three other games during the 2011 World Cup.         
	The matches will be determined by a lottery, in Mumbai, on November 9.         
	We opted for the one plus three option, instead of bidding for either a semi-final or a quarter final and two other games, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president, Jagmohan Dalmiya, explained.         
	One could argue that the CAB, which was represented by Chitrak Mitra at Wednesdays meeting in Mumbai, should have gone for the other option, but there would then have been no guarantee that India would play at the Eden.         
	Clearly, Dalmiya and Co. have played it safe.         
	In fact, Calcuttans will get to see four matches, one more than if the Eden would have got the semi-final or quarter final in Indias quota of big-ticket games.         
	Back in 1987, the Eden had hosted two matches. In 1996, it was just one game  the India-Sri Lanka semi-final, which ended in a humiliating defeat for the home team led by Mohammed Azharuddin.         
	Of the eight centres staging World Cup matches in India, Mumbai didnt qualify for a home game as its hosting the final. Ahmedabad and Mohali went for the one semi-final or quarter final plus two option.         
	Lots were drawn and Mohali got the semi-final allotted to India. Ahmedabad will stage the quarter final in Indias quota of matches.         
	The remaining five centres will get to host five of Indias six group B games. They will be against one of the following (in alphabetical order): England, Ireland, The Netherlands, South Africa and the West Indies.         
	One understands that the remaining group match, against Bangladesh, will be played in that country.         
	Incidentally, Delhi went unrepresented at the meeting, but was put in the one India game plus three bracket.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, the Delhi brass claimed that no intimation had been received. Quite unbelievable that.         
	Bangalore, Chennai and Nagpur are the other centres staging one India match each.         
	All eight venues will also get to host a practice game each.         
	With Pakistan taken off the roster, India will be staging 29 of the 49 matches. Twelve (including one semi-final and one quarter final) have gone to Sri Lanka and 8 (inclusive of two quarter finals) to Bangladesh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Assault blame on Mourinho
                                                   Assault blame on Mourinho
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AND AGENCIES                      
	Greater Manchester Police (GMP) are investigating an allegation of common assault against the Inter Milan manager following Uniteds Champions League victory. It has been alleged Mourinho struck a supporter close to the Inter team bus as he left the stadium following his sides 0-2 defeat.         
	But an Inter spokesman said that the claims are baseless, and denied any wrongdoing on the part of Mourinho.         
	The GMP have contacted United to request CCTV footage of the area and have confirmed a complaint has been made.         
	Shortly before midnight on Wednesday night a man reported that he had been punched in the face outside Old Trafford. We are investigating an allegation of common assault.         
	United would only confirm they are aware of the allegation and are making no further comment.         
	Mourinho was jeered throughout the match by United fans, who sang Youre not special anymore.         
	Mourinho famously announced his arrival on the English stage with an ostentatious sprint down the Old Trafford touchline in 2004 after his unfancied Porto side eliminated United from the Champions League.         
	Since then, his relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson has developed into mutual respect, and last night Mourinho admitted the best team won.         
	Im not angry, said Mourinho.         
	Youre angry and frustrated when your team doesnt play, when it doesnt express its qualities, or when its afraid of playing.         
	This is the kind of match after which, if anyone has anything to criticise my team about, they would have to kill me first because Inter were fantastic tonight, but its not easy to play at Old Trafford and unfortunately luck wasnt on our side, said Mourinho.

                                                   Lajong banking on home support
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: For Shillong, Diwali will be on Sunday when Lajong FC play their first home match of the I-League against Air India. The hill city was buzzing with expectations and excitement on the eve of the match since it will be the first time that an I-League match will be held in the Northeastern region of the country.         
	As coach Stanley Rozario put it from Shillong on Saturday: Its festival time here  We are expecting full house tomorrow (Sunday) as the tickets have already been sold out. There should be around 25,000 fans to cheer the home team.         
	Coming back to football, Air India will no doubt start favourites against Lajong, but the sheer intensity of home support may ultimately prove to be a big boost for Rozarios wards.         
	Speaking on the journey so far, Rozario said: It has been quite tough for us so far. Being a newly promoted side and playing three away matches against top teams first up is not easy at all.         
	Meanwhile, in Margao Pune Football Club (PFC) hold Sporting Cludbe de Goa 2-2.         
	L Jeje and Asim Hassan scored for PFC, while Elizah Junior and Bibiano Fernandez netted for SPorting Clube.

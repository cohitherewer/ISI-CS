                                                   Limba eye on Delhi
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: New national archery coach Limba Ram has his eyes firmly set on winning medals at the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi.         
	I take Delhi Games as a challenge. We will have to focus on excelling in these Games instead of thinking about the next Olympics or Asian Games. I firmly believe that Indian archers are good enough to win medals, especially in recurve division, Limba said.         
	Limba believes the likes of Jayanta Talukdar, Mangal Singh Champia, Rahul Banerjee, Bombayla Devi and Dola Banerjee have it in them to excel at the top level. Limba said he would introduce yoga and meditation, apart from physical training, during the training camp.

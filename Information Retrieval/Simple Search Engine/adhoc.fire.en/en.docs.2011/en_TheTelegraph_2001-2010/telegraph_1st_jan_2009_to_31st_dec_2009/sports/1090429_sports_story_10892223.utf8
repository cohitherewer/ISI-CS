The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Moles backs Knights captain to come good
                                                     Moles backs Knights captain to come good
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Brendon McCullum                           
	Durban: Andy Moles, the New Zealand coach, believes that Brendon McCullum is just one match away from making an impact in the current edition of the IPL.         
	McCullum, the Kolkata Knight Riders captain, is the Black Caps No.2. His scores so far have been: 1 (3 balls), 21 (16 balls), 3 (9 balls) and 1 (6 balls).         
	Moles, who is travelling with the Knights as an observer, said: Brendon hasnt been able to settle down and has been getting out very early... The day hes able to settle down, hell make an impact... Im confident of that.                   Andy Moles      
	Speaking to The Telegraph on board a South African Express CRJ-200 flight from Port Elizabeth on Tuesday morning, Moles added: I dont think the Knights captaincy is weighing him down... From the conversations Ive had with him, Brendons quite liking the role... He loves challenges and this is one...         
	According to Moles, McCullum has the qualities of a leader, which is why hes Daniel Vettoris deputy.         
	The Knights poor show, though, has prompted McCullum to say that hed be prepared to step aside if the team didnt make the semi-finals. Indeed, hes comfortable with accountability.         
	Thats a plus.

	Nice: World champion Viswanathan Anand played out draws with Levon Aronian of Armenia in the fourth round of Amber Blindfold and Rapid Chess tournament here on Wednesday.         
	Anand could not do much against some solid play by Aronian in both blindfold and rapid games. The Indian ace didnt get any real chances to look for victory.         
	The Indian stands joint seventh in blindfold and joint fifth in rapid.         
	Vladimir Kramnik of Russia dealt a double blow to the aspirations of debutant Wang Yue of China winning both the games with consummate ease. Kramnik was in devastating form in both versions of the game. In the first blindfold game Wang Yue struggled while in the second he mixed up moves, lost a pawn and never recovered.         
	The Russian, on 5.5 points out of a possible eight, emerged as the sole leader in the combined standings and is half a point clear of Aronian and Alexander Morozevich of Russia. Morozevich played out a 1-1 draw with Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria.         
	With seven rounds or 14 games still remaining, Teimour Radjabov, after a 2-0 triumph over Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine, jumped to joint fourth spot along with Topalov and Magnus Carlsen of Norway.

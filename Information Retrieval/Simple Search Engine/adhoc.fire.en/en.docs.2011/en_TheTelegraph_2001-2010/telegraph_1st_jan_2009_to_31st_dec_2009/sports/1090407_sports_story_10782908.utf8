The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United have a score to settle
                                                   United have a score to settle
  - CHAMPIONS LEAGUE QUARTERS                       
	London: Manchester United welcome back Wayne Rooney, Nemanja Vidic and Paul Scholes to their Champions League squad for Tuesdays match against Porto at Old Trafford after they were suspended from domestic action at the weekend.         
	Manager Alex Fergusons prospects of establishing a healthy quarter-final first leg lead over Porto would be enhanced further if centre-back Rio Ferdinand shakes off a back injury to play.         
	However, Ferguson will definitely be without striker Dimitar Berbatov who has an ankle injury and will be sidelined for the next two weeks. Holders United, looking to extend their record unbeaten run in the Champions League to 22 matches, go into the game in a far better frame of mind than looked likely after 80 minutes of Sundays Premier League match against Aston Villa.         
	They trailed 2-1 and appeared to be heading for a third league defeat in a row before late goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and teenage substitute Federico Macheda gave them a 3-2 win.         
	The result transformed the mood at Old Trafford with United going back on top of the Premier League and keeping alive their hopes of winning five trophies this season. United will start favourites although, five years ago, Porto knocked United out 3-2 on aggregate in the last 16 on their way to winning the trophy. Coach Jose Mourinho performed a touchline jig that is still a bad memory for many Red Devils fans.         
	Jesualdo Ferreiras Porto team are not as organised nor as tactically disciplined as the one Mourinho built, but they have plenty of attacking threat and go into the match in top form.         
	However, their record in England is poor, losing 11 of the 12 matches they have played. The only exception was the 1-1 draw at Old Trafford against United in 2004.

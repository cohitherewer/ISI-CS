The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Asif recalled, no Razzaq in Champions Trophy squad
                                                     Asif recalled, no Razzaq in Champions Trophy squad
                  Mohammed Asif                     
	Karachi: Pacer Mohammed Asif was recalled while seasoned all-rounder Abdul Razzaq, who quit the ICL to play for the country, was left out as Pakistan Friday announced its 15-member squad for the Champions Trophy in South Africa.         
	Asif, who was suspended for testing positive in the Indian Premier League last year, will complete a 12-month ban on September 22, the day the tournament begins in South Africa. He was even banned by the Pakistan Cricket Board in July, 2008 for the same offence and also for his 19-day ordeal in Dubai in June last year.         
	All-rounder Shahid Afridi was rewarded for his recent match-winning performances by being named the vice-captain. Afridi replaces senior batsman Misbah-ul Haq as Younis Khans deputy.         
	Pakistan chief selector Iqbal Qasim said Asif, who last played an ODI in April 2008 against Bangladesh, was drafted into the team after carefully assessing his form and fitness.         
	Asif has been picked after a careful assessment of his fitness and form by the selectors Former captain Rashid Latif also supervised his training in the emerging players camp here, Qasim said.         
	Qasim said Asif was considered for the team as the Champions Trophy does not start until September 22 and there is ample time for him to train hard and attain peak fitness.         
	The report we have got is he will be 100 per cent match fit and is bowling well.         
	Qasim said the selectors had tried to pick a balanced squad for the eight-nation tournament and were forced to drop Razzaq.         
	We would have liked to have him in the team but unfortunately we can only pick 15 players and he has struggled for fitness in Sri Lanka, the former Test spinner said.         
	Senior batsman Mohammed Yousuf, however, has retained his place.         
	The selectors also debated on the inclusion of experienced opener Salman Butt, but the chief selector said it was decided to go with just one opener Imran Nazir since Pakistan had the option of makeshift openers in Kamran Akmal, Shahid Afridi and even Fawad Alam and Shoaib Malik.         
	Mohtashim Rasheed will replace Aaqib Javed as assistant coach for the Champions Trophy. Official sources said the board has also replaced assistant manager Mohammed Ahmed with Shafqat Rana.         
	The contracts of coach Intikhab Alam and manager Yawar Saeed were also being reviewed, it was learnt.

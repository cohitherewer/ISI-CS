	London: Holders Manchester United, featuring an on-target Michael Owen among their second string, reached the League Cup quarter finals with a 2-0 victory at Championship (second division) side Barnsley on Tuesday.         
	Tottenham Hotspur, beaten by United on penalties in last seasons final and winners in 2008, were eyeing a hattrick of finals after they beat Everton 2-0.         
	Blackburn Rovers beat Championship strugglers Peterborough 5-2, Portsmouth enjoyed a rare win with a 4-0 home success over Stoke City and Aston Villa beat Sunderland on penalties after a 0-0 draw.         
	United, whose first team were beaten 2-0 by Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday, settled early nerves by taking a sixth-minute lead when Danny Welbeck, who scored the winner against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the last round, headed in from a corner.         
	Two seasons ago Barnsley beat Liverpool and Chelsea en route to the FA Cup semi-finals and the Yorkshire side, struggling at the wrong end of the second division table, went close to an equaliser when Daniel Bogdanovic headed against a post midway through the first half.         
	But Owen, enjoying a rare start for United, showed his predators instinct to settle it after an hour with a sharp turn on the edge of the box to wrong-foot two defenders followed by a precise finish into the corner.         
	United then had experienced fullback Gary Neville sent off for a high tackle on Adam Hammill and they had to work hard in the latter stages as Barnsley made, and wasted, several decent chances.         
	Picking out Owens contribution Ferguson said: It was a fantastic goal, good feet, quick and a marvellous finish, Id say it was a great goal.         
	Stand-in goalkeeper Brad Guzan was Villas hero at the Stadium of Light as he saved a penalty from Kenwyne Jones to force extra time before keeping out three Sunderland efforts in the shootout to help his side to a 3-1 penalties success.         
	Meanwhile, the violent incidents surrounding the clash between Barnsley and Manchester United, when eight arrests were made, will be investigated by the FA, the governing body said on Wednesday.         
	In one incident, a group of United fans broke into a food kiosk at the Oakwell stadium trapping eight staff, while they stole cash from the till and took all the stock, a South Yorkshire police spokesman said.

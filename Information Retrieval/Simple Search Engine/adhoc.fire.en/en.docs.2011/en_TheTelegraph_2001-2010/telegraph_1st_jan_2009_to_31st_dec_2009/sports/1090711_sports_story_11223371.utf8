	Cardiff: Australia strengthened their grip on the opening Ashes Test, building a 44-run first innings lead before the weather curtailed the third day in Cardiff.         
	Marcus North was unbeaten on 54 but Michael Clarke fell on 83 after the players returned from a lengthy stoppage to play under floodlights. It was the first time lights have been used at a Test match in this country.         
	With more rain forecast on Saturday, a draw is looming as the most likely scenario with Australia on 479 for five in reply to Englands 435.         
	James Anderson has taken two for 80 but Andrew Flintoff has consistently been the most dangerous England bowler even though his figures, of one for 104, do not reflect that fact.         
	England had enjoyed a good morning session, taking three Australian wickets with the second new ball to suggest they could forge a way back into the match.         
	Anderson and Flintoff bowled in tandem with the second new ball and managed to break the union between Ricky Ponting and Simon Katich that had taken Australia to a commanding 299 for one.         
	Katich had started the day on 104 and added 18 runs to his overnight score before being beaten by an inswinging full toss from Anderson.         
	Flintoff roughed up Mike Hussey with a couple of short balls, one deflected of his helmet for four leg byes, but it was Andersons fuller length which brought the third wicket of the innings.         
	Hussey had seen Anderson nip the ball into fellow left-hander Katich and was deceived when he slanted one across and drove at the wider delivery only to snick a catch to Matt Prior.         
	Ponting continued his dominance, moving to 150 off 221 balls with 14 fours and a six and had seemingly fought his way through the danger when Panesar replaced Anderson.         
	But Panesar seemed re-energised by Englands wickets and drew the first mistake out of Australias captain when he drove hard but got an inside edge onto his stumps.         
	But the afternoon session fell flat for England as Clarke showed why he is one of the best players of spin bowling, using his feet to dominate Panesar and the struggling Graeme Swann.         
	North looked nervy on his Ashes debut and gave a couple of half chances of top edged sweeps, but once he settled the runs started to flow for the man who has played for five county sides.         
	Clarke played the shot of the day when he straight drove Panesar for six and then showed his quick feet to rock back and pull the England left-armer through mid-wicket for four. Clarke reached his fifty off 100 balls with six fours and a six and North joined him on that landmark in the final over before tea as Australia started to build a first innings lead.         
	Flintoff resumed after tea but the players were forced off the field three overs after the interval when heavy rain arrived.         
	They returned two hours later to bowl 12 overs with the Swalec Stadium floodlights turned on. Clarke seemed poised to reach his century but fell hooking Stuart Broad, Englands poorest bowler, before the rain returned.         
	I would have liked to have been there at the end of the day, Clarke said.         
	You would love a hundred especially when you get to 80 runs. Im disappointed with my shot.         
	I should probably have ducked it and let it go. Ive just been told that its the first time that lights have been used in England, so lock me down for the first wicket.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting still best to lead, says Ian
                                                   Ponting still best to lead, says Ian
                      
	London: Australia have lost the Ashes to England but Ricky Ponting, a superior captain than his predecessor Steve Waugh, is still the best man to lead in Tests, according to former captain Ian Chappell.         
	Chappell felt the selectors sold Ponting down the river, picking an all-pace attack for the unresponsive pitch at the Oval.         
	Not only did they (selectors) handcuff Ponting at the Oval with four pacemen on a palpably dry pitch, but they also, once again, resorted to the failed ploy of expecting part-time spinners to do a specialist task. This is a crime punishable by demotion, he wrote in his The Daily Telegraph column.         
	Good selectors protect the captain from himself on the occasions when he requires that insulation. If Ponting clamoured for an all-seam attack at the Oval, the selectors should have been strong enough and wise enough to advise otherwise, he explained.

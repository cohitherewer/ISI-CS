                                                     Bhaichung on warpath
            A STAFF REPORTER            Bhaichung                           
	Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutia Tuesday alleged that the six-month suspension slapped on him by Mohun Bagan is nothing but a pre-determined motive to finish his career.         
	Lawyer Usha Nath Banerjee, whom Bhaichung has appointed as his legal counsel to challenge Bagans decision, was talking to journalists on behalf of the Indian captain.         
	Bhaichung has personally requested me to represent him. So Im here for my client. Bhaichung feels the suspension is nothing but a pre-determined motive to finish off his career. They want to prevent him from playing anywhere, Banerjee said.         
	Referring to IFAs rule 22A (a) regarding the suspension of a player, Banerjee said: According to IFAs rule there should be a disciplinary proceeding initiated before a player is suspended. Bhaichung was not heard.         
	According to Banerjee, Bhaichung at present is a free player and his contract with Bagan does not stand.         
	Bhaichung has completed his term with Bagan for the 2008-09 season. He is a free player now. He has a contract with Bagan till 2010 but his contract does not become operative until he registers himself with the IFA. He is out of the contract till he registers again for 2009-10, Banerjee elaborated.         
	Banerjee, however, did not want to disclose Bhaichungs course of action. Look, obviously he will take action. I cant disclose what that would be This is our personal matter. But I can assure you that we will definitely place this before the appropriate forum It may be the IFA or the AIFF or Fifa or the court, Banerjee said.         
	Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra, when contacted, however, rubbished Bhaichungs allegation and said: Nobody wants to spoil his career. His lawyer is creating unwanted confusion and giving wrong advice. Our decision is entirely according to IFAs rule.         
	There is no problem with it. Ask his lawyer to get his facts right. The football season is not over but it will be over on June 25 Bhaichung is our contracted player and will remain our player till 2010. He is not a free player.

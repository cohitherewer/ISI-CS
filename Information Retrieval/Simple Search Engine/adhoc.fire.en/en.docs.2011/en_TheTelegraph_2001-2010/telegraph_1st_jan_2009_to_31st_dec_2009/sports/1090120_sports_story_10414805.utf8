            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT             Security personnel try to chase out spectators from the ground during a Twenty20 match in Patna on Monday. (PTI)                           
	Patna: Team India openers Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir escaped unhurt as crazy fans clashed with the police, hurling water bottles and stones, during the prize distribution of a Twenty20 cricket tournament at the Moin-ul Haq Stadium on Monday.         
	None of the players were hurt. The police used batons to control the unruly crowd, superintendent of police (city) Anwar Hussein said.         
	Praveen Kumar, Piyush Chawla and former allrounder Ajay Jadeja were also present.         
	Chaos ruled once fans scaled the fence and invaded the ground during the function. As the fans rushed towards the players, the securitymen overpowered a few of them and rained baton blows.         
	Angry at the police action, the spectators in the stands began throwing stones at the police. Amid the chaos, many others barged into the ground through a portion of the fence that gave away.         
	Soon more policemen were called in and a security cordon was thrown around the players and the VIPs, including Bihar governor R.L. Bhatia.         
	Former India cricketer-turned BJP politician Kirti Azad, who is also the president of Association of Bihar Cricket (ABC), had organised the Twenty20 tournament to raise funds for the states flood victims.         
	Earlier, Sehwag led ITC XI to a 34-run victory over rivals Frontline XI led by Jadeja. Batting first, ITC XI made an impressive 201/5. Jadejas unbeaten century went in vain as his team managed to score only 167 for 5.

	Calcutta: She is a grandma with a difference. When women of her age are busy watching their grandchildren grow up, 65-year-old Rani Hamid loves to challenge youngsters on a chequered board. The Bangaldeshi Women International Master is the oldest participant at the ongoing Asian Team Chess Championship at Town Hall.         
	Ranis first inspiration was her father who used to regularly play the game with his friends.         
	As girls, we were not allowed to play a game which was considered to be a pre-occupation of older men she recalled as she spoke to The Telegraph.         
	Born in 1944, in Sylhet, she took up competitive chess at the age of 34 after her late husband Col. M.A Hamid encouraged her to take up the game seriously.         
	Bangladeshs best-known Grandmaster Niaz Murshed praised the veteran for her grit and determination. She started playing chess at an age when most people leave chess.         
	She is very resilient and am example to emulate for young children said Murshed.         
	Hamid won the inaugural Womens National Championship that was held in Dhaka in 1977 and went on to win it a record 21-times.         
	However the first three times that she won it was not recorded by Fide as it didnt recognise Bangladesh Chess Federation.         
	She has also won the British Chess Championship thrice in 1983, 1985 and 1989. She won the WIM norm in 1985.         
	Her son, Kaiser Hamid was the captain of senior national football team and a respected footballer of 1980s.         
	Her grandchildren havent taken up the sport although she tried to woo one of her grandsons taking her to some competitions.         
	One of the competition was tough and after losing a few rounds, he lost interest in the game, she signed off with a smile.

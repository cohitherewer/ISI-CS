            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Charlotte Edwards England will take on Haidee Tiffens New Zealand in the final of the ICC Womens World Cup at North Sydney Oval on Sunday.         
	England have won the World Cup twice  the inaugural edition in 1973 on its home turf and then in 1993 when it defeated New Zealand by 67 runs  while New Zealands only success has come in 2000 in their backyard when they beat Australia. Both the teams look well balanced and theres not much difference between the two sides. They have previously met 49 times with New Zealand winning 29 matches and England 18.

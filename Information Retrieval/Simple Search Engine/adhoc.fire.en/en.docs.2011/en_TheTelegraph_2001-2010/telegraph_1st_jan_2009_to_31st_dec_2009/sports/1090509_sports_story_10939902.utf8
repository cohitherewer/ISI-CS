The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chelsea brace for heavy penalty
                                                   Chelsea brace for heavy penalty
            [+uc('Matt Hughes   The Times, London')+]                      
	Didier Drogba apologised on Thursday for abusing Tom Henning Ovrebo, the referee, in the aftermath of Chelseas bitter Champions League exit as the club braced themselves to be served a series of misconduct charges.         
	Uefa is preparing to launch an investigation into the ugly scenes that marred Chelseas semi-final, second leg at home to Barcelona on Wednesday, which could lead to as many as five charges being brought against the club and their players.         
	A high-ranking source close to Uefa warned: Watch for the fallout  it could be tough. He said that a hefty fine was the likely punishment, but added that forcing Chelsea to play their opening home group-stage match next season behind closed doors, or at a neutral venue, could not be discounted.         
	Drogba is facing the stiffest individual sanction after repeatedly abusing Ovrebo in a lengthy confrontation on the pitch that continued in the tunnel, although his public apology may lessen any punishment.         
	The Ivory Coast striker is unlikely to be the only player singled out. Michael Ballack could be charged for confronting Ovrebo after a fourth penalty appeal was rejected in the final seconds as Barcelona went through on the away goals rule, Jose Bosingwa faces sanctions for describing the Norwegian official as a thief and claiming that he was bought, while Uefa has also taken a dim view of John Terrys criticism of Ovrebo. Chelsea are also likely to be charged with failing to control their players.         
	Chelsea initially stood by the criticisms of the referee, but changed tack late on Thursday and issued their own statement in which they described the post-match confrontations as regrettable.         
	Drogba also performed a U-turn after earlier insisting that he had done nothing wrong and had no reason to apologise. The strikers behaviour could still return to haunt him, however, as it is understood that senior figures at the club are against giving him the new four-year contract that he is demanding.         
	Instead, Chelsea are preparing a compromise package of a one-year extension to his present deal, which expires next summer, although he is unlikely to accept it.         
	I was very upset at what happened during the game, but, having seen the pictures on TV I accept that I overreacted, Drogba said. I also fully accept that the language I used did not set a good example for those watching at home, especially children. I regret that in the heat of the moment I let out my incredible frustration and disappointment in this way, and for that I apologise. While Drogbas apology came of his own volition, Chelsea forced Bosingwa to issue a retraction.         
	Uefa will decide next week whether to take action against Chelsea players. Uefa said Friday it has received both the referees and delegates report from the game and will review the Chelsea players actions both during and after the final whistle at Stamford Bridge.         
	Meanwhile, Michael Ballack, a protagonist in the ugly scenes that marred Chelseas Champions League exit, has been rewarded with an extended contract while the club await Uefa sanctions over the affair, this newspaper can reveal.         
	Ballack, 32, the Germany captain, who is likely to be among the players cited by Uefa next week for haranguing Ovrebo, has agreed terms on a one-year extension to a deal that includes wages of 121,000 a week and will keep him at Stamford Bridge until the end of next season.

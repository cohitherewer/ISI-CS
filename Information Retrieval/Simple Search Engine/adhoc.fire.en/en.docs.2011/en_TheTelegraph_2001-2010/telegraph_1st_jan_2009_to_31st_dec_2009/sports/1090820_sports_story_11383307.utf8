The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Andrew Flintoff can secure his legend
                                                     Andrew Flintoff can secure his legend

	Andrew Flintoff was excused from the team warm-ups at the Oval on Tuesday, which will have suited his preferred philosophy of simply turning up to play. But if that was a rare concession to his true self two days before his grand finale, Flintoff will leave the Test arena much as he entered it  a man with an identity crisis.         
	Freddie has always regarded himself as a batsman who bowls, often to the point of myopia. Everyone else, and this is something borne out by his Test record too, feels his strength lies as a fast bowler who managed the odd valuable innings, such as the brilliant hundred he made against Australia at Trent Bridge in 2005.         
	He could prove us all wrong during the Ashes decider that starts at the Oval on Thursday but it would be the exception rather than the rule. If you asked his captain, Andrew Strauss, whether he would prefer his retiring asset to sign off against Australia with a hundred or five wickets, he would plump for the latter without hesitation.         
	Discovering you are not who you think you are cannot be easy for any player, let alone one of Flintoffs public standing. Fortunately, any frustration is likely to have been tempered by his recovery from a succession of career-threatening injuries.         
	Overcoming them has been a major achievement in itself and worthy of celebration, as would a second Ashes victory for his team should one come to pass over the next few days.         
	Not that his adoring public ever seemed to notice that his legend mostly exceeded his deeds. Five Test hundreds and three five-wicket hauls in 78 Tests is decent but not devastatingly good.         
	If he had a peak it came between 2003 and 2006, when in more than 41 Tests he averaged 40 with the bat and 27.9 with the ball.         
	Impressive though that was, it is not Ian Botham-esque, the all-rounder all subsequent pretenders have been compared to.         
	In 102 Tests, Botham made 14 hundreds and took 27 five-wicket and four 10-wicket hauls, the majority of them match-turning efforts.         
	Flintoff has contributed his own match-altering performances, but like Mike Gatting, who will forever dine out on his two victories as England captain because they won the Ashes, they have added cachet for mostly being against Australia.         
	Unfortunately, his bowling never quite reached those heights of skill again, though his powers as a battering ram, his general modus operandi when the ball is not swinging, was vital at Lords three weeks ago, where his five for 92 gave England victory.         
	His many injuries may have prevented him from raising his skill levels over the years, but the rehabilitation required ensured he was always strong and fit enough to bowl fast, even if it was without frills.         
	Flintoffs main asset is that he provided certainty, especially with the ball, something every captain craves. He was not quite so accommodating towards the team effort off the field but then discipline has never been his middle name.         
	Many feel he has changed of late, from a happy-go-lucky Preston lad to calculating cash cow, gratuitously flashing tins of Red Bull and his Puma kit to the nearest camera. What is plain is that he does not see his duties as a team man extending beyond the cricket pitch.         
	All will be forgiven and his legend secured should he repeat his Lords performance here at the Oval. Analysing the Flintoff phenomenon, Nasser Hussain once said that, He has something of the village green to which people can relate. Let us hope that something ends with him getting a jug or two in here over the next few days.

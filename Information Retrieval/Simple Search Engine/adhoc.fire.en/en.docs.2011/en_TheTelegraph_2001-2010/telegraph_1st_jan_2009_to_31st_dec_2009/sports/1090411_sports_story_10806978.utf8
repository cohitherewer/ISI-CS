The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gayle will join camp tomorrow
                                                   Gayle will join camp tomorrow
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The West Indies captain Chris Gayle will join the Kolkata Knight Riders at their base in Bloemfontein on Sunday. The belligerent left-hander had missed the first edition of the Indian Premier League last year.         
	Fast bowler Ishant Sharmas position will be known on Tuesday when he submits his visa application for South Africa in New Delhi. The lanky pacer was unable to submit the paperwork earlier due to the long weekend.         
	Therefore, post Sunday, the Knight Riders will have all their players at the camp with the exception of Ishant.         
	New Zealand vice-captain Brendon McCullum and the Sri Lanka duo of spinner Ajantha Mendis and all-rounder Angelo Mathews joined the camp on Thursday evening.         
	Knight Riders next warm-up match is on Saturday when they are to play amongst themselves. Friday was devoted to practice.

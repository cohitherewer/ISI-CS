The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI doctor kept in dark 
                                                     BCCI doctor kept in dark 
                  Zaheer Khan                     
	Mumbai: Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) sports medicine consultant, Dr Anant Joshi Saturday said that he was not consulted by the board about the shoulder injury sustained by Zaheer Khan.         
	In Zaheers case I was not consulted (by the BCCI), Dr Joshi said.         
	According to Joshi, Zaheers injury and its treatment very clearly shows there needs to be better co-ordination between the physio and the surgeon in treating injuries.         
	One has to have a balance while taking decisions as far as surgery or rehab is concerned. It should be a joint decision between a physio and a surgeon. One should neither rush into a surgical treatment nor drag the physiotherapy treatment too long. Both should strike a fine balance together, Dr Joshi added.         
	Zaheer sustained the injury in mid-May while playing for Mumbai Indians in the second edition Indian Premier League (IPL). But he waited till July 13 for the surgery in South Africa.         
	Expecting Zaheers recovery time to last from four to six months, Dr Joshi feels a nodal sports medicine centre with several branches is the ideal way to treat injuries to cricketers in India.

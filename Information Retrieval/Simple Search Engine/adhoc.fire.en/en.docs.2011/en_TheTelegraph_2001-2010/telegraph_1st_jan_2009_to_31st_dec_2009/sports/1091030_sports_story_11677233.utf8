	Casares (Spain): Indias Jeev Milka Singh and Americas Anthony Kim laid down early markers with emphatic victories as the top seeds toiled on the first day of the World Matchplay Championship here on Thursday.         
	Kim stormed to the top of Group A by defeating two-time US Open champion Retief Goosen of South Africa and English top seed Paul Casey, while Jeev thrashed world number five Lee Westwood to take command of Group D.         
	Englands Oliver Wilson tops Group B after defeating both Spanish 10th seed Sergio Garcia and Germanys Martin Kaymer by one hole, with Australias Robert Allenby second thanks to a win over Kaymer and a half with Garcia.         
	Argentinas Angel Cabrera shares the lead in Group C with Englands Simon Dyson after they both won their opening matches, while Dysons compatriot Ross Fisher is level with Singh in Group D after beating Argentine Camilo Villegas.         
	In a break from the tournaments traditional format, players in each four-man group play in a round-robin format with the top player from each of the four groups progressing to the semi-finals on Saturday.         
	Jeev was five up on second seed Westwood after just seven holes and went on to secure a resounding six-up victory with a birdie on the last.         
	Casey, the world number four, was returning to action after an 11-week absence due to injury but lost his opening match against Strange when he missed a seven-foot birdie putt to tie the match on the 18th hole.         
	Meanwhile in Sentosa, Jyoti Randhawa brought home a two-under 69 to lie tied seventh as inclement weather forced an early close in the opening round of the Singapore Open golf tournament Thursday.

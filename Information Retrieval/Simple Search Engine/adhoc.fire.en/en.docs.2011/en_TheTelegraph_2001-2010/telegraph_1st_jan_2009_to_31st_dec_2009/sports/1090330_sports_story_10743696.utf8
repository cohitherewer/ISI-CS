	Hyderabad: The big holiday crowd that gathered at the Gachibowli Indoor Stadium here Sunday returned home a disappointed lot as the Indian pair of Diju Valiyaveetil and Jwala Gutta went down in the mixed doubles final of the Sunrise Yonex Indian Open badminton.         
	While the vociferous crowd cheered the Indian duo relentlessly throughout the 33-minute encounter, Jwala and Diju surrendered tamely to the Indonesian pair of Flandy Limpele and Vita Marissa 14-21, 17-21.         
	Except for a brief period in the second game, the Indians were at the receiving end throughout the tie and had no answer to the aggressive attitude of the Indonesian duo.         
	We ran out of patience when we needed to grab the initiative, Jwala said about the second game. We were catching up, had some big rallies but couldnt maintain it in the end. Still, I would say it was a satisfactory show. After all, it was our first tournament of the year.         
	The fact, however, remained that the Indonesians were a cut above their opponents. Left-hander Limpele was the architect of the victory with his deceptive service and equally good returns.         
	Limpele was really good, we had problems with his service, admitted Diju later. He is a fluent player with both backhand and forehand.         
	The sudden dip in Jwalas form was also one of the prime factors for the defeat.         
	The Hyderabad-based left-hander is considered the glamour girl of Indian badminton because of her looks, physical fitness and graceful movement on court. On Sunday, when all eyes were on her, she faltered time and again to give away easy points.         
	The first game ended in a jiffy as the Indonesians smashed their way to a big lead. Their attack was powerful and effective and it had their opponents in all sorts of problems. The cheering for the Indians grew louder when Jwala and Diju revived hopes of a turnaround in the second game. Sensing trouble, the Indonesians switched to attack mode and quickly restored parity. Once they came back to make it 14-all, things looked bleak for the hosts.         
	In the womens singles final, Malaysian Julia Peng Xian Wong raised hopes of yet another upset before losing to Pi Hongyan of France.         
	The top-seed Pi took time to settle down and finally found her rhythm midway through the second game. The world No.4 won 17-21, 21-15, 21-14 in 54 minutes, the longest final of the championship.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Revised ICC Code in place
                                                                                                                                   Revised ICC Code in place
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) Thursday introduced anti-racism and anti-corruption codes in its revised Code of Conduct to maintain and promote fair play and multiculturalism.         
	The three new codes were put in place after a comprehensive consultation and review process with all stakeholders, the ICC said in a statement.         
	The ICC said the stand-alone code has been put in place to prevent any racial spats arising out of language or cultural differences.         
	The anti-corruption code seeks to further empower the ICCs Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU).         
	Players who are found guilty of such offences can expect to serve long suspension periods and face hefty fines under this code.

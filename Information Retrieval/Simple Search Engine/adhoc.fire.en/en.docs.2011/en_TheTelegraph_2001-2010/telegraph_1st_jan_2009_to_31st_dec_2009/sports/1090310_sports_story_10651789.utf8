The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Advantage Dempo
                                                   Advantage Dempo
                      
	Margao: Dempo Sports Club hold psychological advantage when they take on Syrias Al Majd in their lung opener of the AFC Cup on Tuesday at Nehru Stadium here. The Goa outfit are happy they are playing some of their 2009 AFC Cup matches at home.         
	Playing in front of the home crowd is a different experience, said coach Armando Colaco. Therefore, this is the best chance to get off to a winning start and travel to Jordan for the next match on March 7, he said. The hot and humid condition (in Goa) will also work in our favour.

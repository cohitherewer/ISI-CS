The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Schumi to the rescue 
                                                   Schumi to the rescue 
    - Seven-time champion will come out of retirement to replace Massa           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                            
	Seven-time Formula One champion Michael Schumacher will replace injured Ferrari driver Felipe Massa for the rest of the season. Earlier on Wednesday, a German daily had reported that Schumacher would come out of retirement and drive for his former team, for whom he currently works in advisory capacity.         
	Ferrari confirmed the move on Wednesday afternoon, saying the German would replace the injured Brazilian driver Felipe Massa until the end of the season.         
	Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro intends to put Michael Schumacher in Felipe Massas car until the Brazilian driver will be able to race again, Ferrari confirmed in a statement.         
	Michael Schumacher said he is ready and, over the next few days, will undertake a specific training programme at the end of which confirmation will be given of his participation in the championship with effect from the European Grand Prix on the 23rd of August.         
	Schumacher said on his own website: The most important thing first: thank God, all news concerning Felipe are positive. I wish him all the best again.         
	I was meeting this afternoon with Stefano Domenicali and Luca di Montezemolo and together we decided that I will prepare myself to take the place of Felipe.         
	Though it is true that the chapter Formula 1 has been closed for me since long and completely, it is also true that for loyalty reasons to the team I cannot ignore that unfortunate situation. But as the competitor I am I also very much look forward to facing this challenge.         
	Schumacher, though, will first have to undergo a rigorous training programme as he is understood to still be recovering from neck and back injuries sustained in a motorbike test in Spain in February.         
	Massa, who suffered horrific head injuries in the Hungarian Grand Prix at the weekend, is still in intensive care following his crash which was caused when a metal spring from a Brawn GP car, driven by compatriot Rubens Barrichello, hit him as he was travelling at 170mph during qualifying on Saturday.         
	Massa was airlifted to the AEK military hospital in Budapest where emergency surgery was performed immediately before the Ferrari driver was induced into a coma.         
	Schumacher, who won 91 Formula One races in a sixteen-year career with Jordan, Benetton and Ferrari, retired from the sport in 2006, two years after he won his fifth consecutive world championship drivers title with the Italian manufacturer who had not won the title since Jody Scheckters success in 1979.         
	The Germans spokeswoman, Sabine Kehm, had said on Tuesday: Usually, I would say hes not interested because hes fine with his life and he doesnt miss anything, but now the situation is so different  its very hypothetical.         
	The whole thing will be considered by Ferrari. If they approach Michael, then he will consider it. quot;         
	Ferrari have done their part and Schumacher will return to an F1 cockpit for the final seven races of the season.  
	life in the fast lane  
	career in GRAND PRIX  Schumacher rsquo;s first Grand Prix was with Jordan in Belgium in 1991, as a stand-in for jailed Belgian driver Bertrand Gachot. Despite completing only 500 metres in the race, he made an immediate impression.
  Snapped up by Benetton after that debut, a move that provoked a bitter legal tussle, and scored points in only his second appearance with fifth place in Italy.
  Mexico provided the first podium of Schumacher rsquo;s career in 1992, and his first win followed later that year in Belgium. Yet he had to wait until Monaco in 1994 for his first pole position.
  Won his first of seven titles later that year, going on to triumph in 1995 (also with Benetton), and 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 (with Ferrari).
  He retired at the end of the 2006 season.  
	RECORDS GALORE  Schumacher is the only driver to win seven championships in Formula One and he owns most of the sport rsquo;s meaningful records.
  In 2002 he finished every race on the podium, winning the title with six races to spare mdash; the fastest championship in Formula One.
  In 2004, when Ferrari were dominant, he won a record 13 races in a single season and finished first in seven successive races, also a record.
  Schumacher won an unprecedented 91 times, one fewer than the combined tally of the next two most successful drivers Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Intikhab Alam: A captain has to take his own decisions
                                                     Intikhab Alam: A captain has to take his own decisions
    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  PAKISTANS FORMER CAPTAIN AND CURRENT COACH ON CAPTAINCY             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                    
	Johannesburg: Former Pakistan captain Intikhab Alam, who is again wearing the coachs hat, spoke to The Telegraph on captaincy.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Who qualifies to be a good captain         
	Somebody who consults others, but eventually takes his own decisions... And, having taken a decision, goes through with it. While communicating with the players and having a clear mind is one aspect, trying to lead from the front definitely is another.         
	His role model captain         
	Abdul Hafeez Kardar... Id say he was my mentor... I learnt decision making from him, learnt the importance of discipline... The need to look after the youngsters and the importance of carrying the team along.         
	Pakistans finest captain         
	Kardar... For me, he was a complete captain. Id put Imran Khan after him.         
	Imrans qualities         
	Imran was a little different from Kardar, who was a strict disciplinarian... Imran communicated well with the players and was happy setting an example... He encouraged youngsters and would identify their mistakes instead of giving them a piece of his mind... The quality I liked most in Imran was his always being positive.         
	[Intikhab, incidentally, was the cricket manager/coach when Pakistan won the 1992 World Cup under Imrans captaincy.]         
	On Younis Khan, Pakistans Test and ODI captain, and T20 captain Shahid Afridi         
	Both are fairly new to the job, but have the qualities to serve the country well.         
	The finest Indian captain         
	(Grins) Id pick Tiger Pataudi. After him, it would be Rahul Dravid and Ajit Wadekar. I found Dravid to be a good thinker and somebody who liked the game to be clean.         
	Leading captains today (alphabetically):         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni: I like his body language and I find him to be brave... Theres a lot of pressure on an Indian captain, but he seems to handle it well.         
	Ricky Ponting: He has lost some quality players in recent times, but that hasnt made him a bad captain. Indeed, I regard him very highly.         
	Kumar Sangakkara: I watched him from close on our recent tour of Sri Lanka and saw that he read situations very well... He keeps the team together.         
	Finally, his message to rookie captains         
	Communicate with the players and see how to get the best out of each one of them... Obviously, because people are different by nature, you cant treat all the same way.

                                                   Bhupathi-Knowles reach last four
                      
	Cincinnati: The worlds top four players will face off at the Cincinnati Masters as Roger Federer, Andy Murray, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic go head-to-head in two mouth watering semi-finals.         
	In the doubles, Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles inched closer to their second successive ATP Masters title by reaching the semifinals with a straight set win over Michael Llodra and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.         
	Winners of last weeks Montreal Masters, the fourth-seeded Indo-Bahamian pair edged past the unseeded French pair 7-6 (6), 6-3 in the quarter finals. Bhupathi and Knowles saved four of the five break points while converting two of three opportunities to seal victory in 83 minutes.         
	In the semis, they will face Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjic.         
	Federer and Murray will meet for the ninth time while Nadal and Djokovic will face each other for the 19th time in all and the fifth this year.         
	It is the first time since the Monte Carlo Open in 2008 and only the 13th time in the past 25 years that the top four-ranked players have made it to the semi-finals of a Tour event.         
	Top seed Federer cruised past former world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt 6-3, 6-4, while holder Murray had to battle back to beat Frenchman Julien Benneteau 4-6, 6-3, 6-1.

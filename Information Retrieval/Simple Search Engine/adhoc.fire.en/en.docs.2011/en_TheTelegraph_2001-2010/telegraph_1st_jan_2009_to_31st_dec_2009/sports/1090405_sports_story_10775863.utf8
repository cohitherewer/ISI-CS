The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Freddie hattrick in England win
                                                     Freddie hattrick in England win
                  Flintoff in Gros Islet on Friday                     
	Gros Islet (St Lucia): England ended their ragged tour of the West Indies on a high on Friday when an Andrew Flintoff hattrick helped them beat the hosts by 26 runs in a rain-shortened match to win the one-day series 3-2.         
	Flintoff took five for 19 in his five overs, including the hattrick in his final over, as England claimed their first one-day series victory in the Caribbean.         
	England bowled with accuracy and discipline after an earlier batting collapse meant they managed only 172 for five from their allotted 29 overs.         
	Put in to bat, England started well as they overcame the early loss of Andrew Strauss to reach 88 for two after 15 overs on a difficult pitch.         
	Kevin Pietersen was looking good on 48 when recalled spinner Sulieman Benn had him controversially caught by Darren Sammy, with television pictures suggesting he grounded the ball.         
	The West Indies chase got off to the worst possible start when captain Chris Gayle was caught in the slips off Jimmy Anderson off the third ball of the innings.         
	Shivnarine Chanderpaul (13) and Ramnaresh Sarwan (23), who have troubled England throughout the tour, both settled in but failed to build on their starts as England took wickets at regular intervals.

                                                     South Africans look to seal ODI series
            A STAFF REPORTER            De Villiers                           
	Calcutta: The South Africans can seal the one-day series against Australia, and with it, confirm their status as the No.1 side in the International Cricket Council ODI rankings, if they win the fourth tie of the five-match series at the Sahara Oval St Georges in Port Elizabeth on Monday.         
	South Africa with, 126 ratings points, have four points more than Australia who follow second with 122 ratings points.         
	The Proteas recovered well from the loss by a margin of 141 runs in the first ODI at Durban to register clinical victories in the second and third ODIs at Centurion and Cape Town respectively.         
	Confident after smashing an 87-ball 80 in the Cape Town ODI, Proteas batsman AB de Villiers said there would be nothing like finishing off the series in Port Elizabeth itself.         
	It would be great to finish the series (off) here, commented AB de Villiers who has an average of 59 and a strike rate of 87 after the first three matches.         
	Our batters set it up very nicely for us on Thursday night. I think 230 odd was the previous highest successful night runs chase at Sahara Park Newlands, so to set them 290 to win was always going to be a very tough task. It was a very good win for us.         
	The final match of the series is at the New Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg on Friday.         
	De Villiers, however, did not make much of the chance to consolidate their presence at the top of the table saying that more important to the team was the standard they set for themselves and the goals they want to achieve. According to the stylish right-hand bat, the No.1 place was incidental in so far as it depended on the results going their way.         
	We are not really focused on that (the No. 1 ranking). We have got our own standards that we like to set and the goals that we want to achieve. Obviously, if we win this game  which is one of our goals  we will maintain the No. 1 spot.         
	Australia lost their top spot to the Proteas when they lost the previous ODI series between the two countries at home.

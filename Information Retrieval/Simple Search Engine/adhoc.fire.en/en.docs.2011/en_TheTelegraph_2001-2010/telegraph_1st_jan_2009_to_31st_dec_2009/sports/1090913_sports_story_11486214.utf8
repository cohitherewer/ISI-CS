The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | McEnroe: Roof is a must 
                                                   McEnroe: Roof is a must 
                      
	New York: John McEnroe said the USTA cant be serious about going much longer without a roof over Arthur Ashe Stadium.         
	Fridays unrelenting rain drowned any hope of seeing a racket raised in competition on the twelfth day at the National Tennis Center, sending the final weekend of the hardcourt major into chaos for a second year in a row.         
	Certainly today (Friday) is a damn shame, four-time champion and TV commentator John McEnroe said as he was leaving the complex after the lost day at Flushing Meadows.         
	The resumption of Rafael Nadals quarter final against Fernando Gonzalez was washed away as were both of the womens semi-finals and mens doubles final.         
	Foul weather and the Opens unique scheduling for the final weekend leave no margin for error, and forced a Monday mens title tilt for the second year running.         
	On Saturday, when the match resumed, Nadal took advantage of an embarrassing collapse by the world No. 11 to win 7-6, 7-6, 6-0.         
	McEnroe, 50, said he had lobbied US Tennis Association officials from the start to put a roof over massive Arthur Ashe Stadium when it was built to replace Louis Armstrong Stadium in 1997 as the tournaments main stage.         
	It seemed like a no-brainer but people at the USTA (US Tennis Association) decided they wanted to build the biggest (stadium), McEnroe said about the 23,000-seat Ashe building.         
	But at the same price they couldve had a slightly smaller stadium and had a roof.         
	Officials spoke last year about studies it had done to add a $100 million retractable roof but no plan to move forward have been announced. The Australian Open and Wimbledon employ roofs, and the French Open has plans for one in the near future.         
	My idea was for utilising it not only when it rains but to allow for stadium use year round, and for other things, like have some kind of tennis academy and have kids stay there. You could have people living in those (corporate) boxes, for example. Seemed like a great thing.         
	Or have rock concerts and other things there to get more income generated for the kids.         
	McEnroe knew the arguments against but was not swayed. I know they say it doesnt rain as much here in New York as it does in London, for example, he said. But now theyre in a big hole, because they have the biggest (tennis) stadium in the world and the expense to build it (roof) is so big that they dont want to lay it out.         
	Weather has fouled up recent match scheduling.         
	In 2006, a total of six sessions were washed out including two full days of play. Last year, Roger Federer waited until Monday to claim his fifth successive Open crown and the women played their final on Sunday.

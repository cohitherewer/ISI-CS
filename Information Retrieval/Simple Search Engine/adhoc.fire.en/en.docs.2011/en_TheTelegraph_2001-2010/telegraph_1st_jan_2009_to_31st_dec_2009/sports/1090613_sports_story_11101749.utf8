The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warne: Johns England stint good for Aussies
                                                   Warne: Johns England stint good for Aussies
                      
	Melbourne: Australian legend Shane Warne has taken a dig at John Buchanan after he took up a coaching role with England, saying his overcomplicated methods would only boost Australias chances of retaining the Ashes starting next month.         
	Buchanan has taken up a short-term coaching assignment with England just before the high-profile five-Test series, but Warne, who has been a stern critic of the former Australia coach since his playing days, feels the move will make the Aussies more hungry for win.         
	[The formal announcement on Buchanan though hasnt been made as yet.]         
	I think thats a great move because that means weve got more of a chance. Hopefully, Buck (Buchanan) will be doing his stuff and hell be working and doing all his things and hopefully overcomplicating things, he said.         
	I reckon it gives our chances a big boost and makes our blokes more hungry. Hopefully, he gets all of them in a boot camp and Freddy (Andrew) Flintoff and (Kevin) Pietersen hurt their knees, that would be great, he was quoted as saying by a local daily.         
	Warnes criticism came close on the heels of fellow leg-spinner Stuart MacGills condemnation of Buchanans appointment. MacGill was far more vocal in his criticism, saying Buchanans coaching had cost Australia the 2005 Ashes in England.         
	That was the first time he was in a situation where we werent playing as well as we would have liked, and we were getting outplayed, MacGill said.         
	Warne believes Aussies start as favourites to win the Ashes, which starts in Cardiff on July 8.

	Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar has run into more trouble with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) issuing him a showcause notice for violating the terms of his central contract with them.         
	Sources in the board confirmed that the showcause notice signed by director of cricket operations Zakir Khan was sent to Shoaib two days back charging him with violating three clauses of his central contract with the PCB.         
	Shoaib has been asked to submit his reply by Friday and if the board is not satisfied with his reply it reserves the right to penalise him.         
	Shoaib told a television channel that he would give an answer after consulting his lawyers. (PTI)

	St Georges (Grenada): The West Indies opener Dale Richards hit 11 boundaries and two sixes to score 69 and lead his team to 107 for three at lunch Friday on the opening day of the second Test against Bangladesh.               
	At midnight, the West Indies were 149 for four. Travis Dowlin (41) and David Bernard (12) were at the crease               
	But Mahmudullahs two wickets in his only over  the penultimate of the session  gave Bangladesh the momentum after they had won the toss and sent the hosts in to bat at the National Cricket Stadium here.         
	Mahmudullah, who took five for 51 in the second innings of the first Test that Bangladesh won, had figures of two for 9.         
	Travis Dowlin was unbeaten on 12 with captain Floyd Reifer yet to score at the interval.         
	Richards and Omar Phillips gave the West Indies a bright start with a stand of 60 inside the first hour.         
	Phillips never looked assured in compiling 23 off 29 balls with three fours. After surviving a chance to mid-on, Phillips was out in the same over to left-arm spinner Shakib-al Hasan, holing out to Tamim Iqbals brilliant, low running catch at deep midwicket.         
	Shakib, captaining Bangladesh due to the injury to Mashrafe Mortaza, had figures of one for 29.         
	Richards, who celebrated his 33rd birthday on Thursday, played some majestic strokes and arrived at his maiden Test 50 off 64 balls with his 10th four. He hit a lofted six and a pulled four in the same over from Shakib.

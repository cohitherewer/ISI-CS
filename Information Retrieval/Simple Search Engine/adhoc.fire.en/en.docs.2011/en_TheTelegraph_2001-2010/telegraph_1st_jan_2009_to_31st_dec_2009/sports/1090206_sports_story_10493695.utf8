The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | English tail wags on Day II
                                                   English tail wags on Day II
                      
	Kingston: England lost Andrew Flintoff in the third over of the morning but moved to 311 for eight at lunch on the second day of the first Test against the West Indies at Sabina Park on Thursday.         
	The tourists resumed on 236 for five and the West Indians made an early breakthrough when Flintoff was caught at backward point by Brendan Nash off Daren Powell. The allrounder did not add to his overnight 43.         
	The short delivery from Powell failed to rise as much as Flintoff, who found himself cramped on the shot, had anticipated and Australian-born Nash, a nimble fielder, comfortably pocketed the catch.         
	Jerome Taylor then removed Stuart Broad, the England number seven edging a full-length delivery to Sulieman Benn at gully.         
	Wicketkeeper Matt Prior was a tougher proposition for the home side though, and having started the day on 27 he moved on to 64, playing some smart shots, before he was dismissed caught and bowled by spinner Benn.         
	Prior, keen to take the initiative, moved down the track to Benn but his drive was too close to the lanky slow left-armer who took a smart catch off his own bowling.

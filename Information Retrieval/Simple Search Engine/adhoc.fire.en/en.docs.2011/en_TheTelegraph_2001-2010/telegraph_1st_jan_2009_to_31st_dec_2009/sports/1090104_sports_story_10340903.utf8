	Chennai/Nagpur: Bolstered by the return of Sachin Tendulkar and Zaheer Khan, Mumbai will start favourites against Saurashtra in the Ranji Trophy semi-final starting Sunday. Tamil Nadu will take on Uttar Pradesh in the other semi-final.         
	Mumbai, the best performers in the Super League so far, will be on a high, having registered more wins than any other team. Moreover, the presence of Tendulkar and Zaheer, who have not played Ranji Trophy since their title win in 2006-07, will undoubtedly inspire youngsters like Ajinkya Rahane and Dhawal Kulkarni.         
	Mumbai coach Pravin Amre said as much: It will be a boost for our youngsters, who have already done well. The presence of Sachin and Zaheer will be highly motivating as the players will be wanting to do well along with them.         
	On the batting front, Mumbai have a solid opening duo in Rahane and captain Wasim Jaffer, who so far are the highest run-getters in the tournament with 976 and 873 runs respectively, from eight matches. Rahane, who has been in sensational form, has scored four centuries while experienced Jaffer has scored three hundreds.         
	The middle order, too, looks rock solid with the likes of Rohit Sharma, Sahil Kukreja, Amol Muzumdar and Abhishek Nayar. Tendulkars return will only make it stronger.         
	Meanwhile, Zaheer, who picked up nine wickets in the 2006-07 Ranji final against Bengal, will add impetus to the Mumbai pace battery which has seen the emergence of Kulkarni. Kulkarni, who hogged the limelight during the inaugural Indian Premier League, has claimed 34 wickets from seven of the eight matches so far, including two five-wicket hauls in the last four innings. Apart from Zaheers experience, veteran Ajit Agarkar will also play an important role. The spin department, too, has teeth in experienced Sairaj Bahatule and offie Ramesh Powar.         
	However, the only thing that might worry Jaffer and Co is their poor showing against Saurashtra during the league stages where they had to play out of their skin to save the match after following on.         
	Meanwhile, Saurashtra, who have made it to the Ranji semi-finals for the second year in a row, are pumped up after their stirring fightback against Karnataka in the quarter finals.         
	Young Cheteshwar Pujara, who has drawn comparisons with Rahul Dravid for his ability to play long innings, starred in the victory with a patient 112 to see his side through. Pujara has accumulated 867 runs with four centuries and an unbeaten 302, to be placed third in the list of most run-getters in the tournament, and Saurashtra will be relying heavily on him to deliver the goods once again.         
	Apart from Pujara, all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja has been another stand-out performer for Saurashtra this season. He has chipped in with both bat and ball at crucial junctures to help his teams cause.         
	In the second semi-final, it is basically Tamil Nadus batsmen against Uttar Pradeshs bowlers. UP will be missing R.P. Singh, who is out with an injured shoulder, but Praveen Kumar and Bhuvneshwar Kumar will test the batting line-up consisting of Abhinav Mukund, Murali Vijay, S. Badrinath, Dinesh Karthik and S. Suresh Kumar. (PTI)

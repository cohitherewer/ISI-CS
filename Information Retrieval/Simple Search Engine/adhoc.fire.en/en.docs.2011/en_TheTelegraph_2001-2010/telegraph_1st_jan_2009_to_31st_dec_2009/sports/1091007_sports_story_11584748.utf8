            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Penn Orji during practice at Makardah in Howrah on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Mumbai: East Bengal have been hampered by a lack of practice in the lead up to their I-League clash against Mahindra United but the second round fixture was facing the prospect of being rescheduled with more rain forecast for Wednesday.         
	The Calcutta giants have not had a single training session since arriving in the city on Sunday as incessant showers have left the Cooperage ground soggy. And, with no separate facility for training, the teams preparation has been reduced to warm-ups on a narrow grassless patch in front of the dressing room on Monday and Tuesday.         
	The team management has written to the All India Football Federation through the host association, Western India Football Association, requesting that the game be postponed but that might be to no avail.         
	We have had absolutely no preparation. Since reaching here, we have gone three days without practice, and when you are taking on a team like Mahindra (United), it is an injustice, coach Subhas Bhowmick said on the eve of the match.         
	I am feeling helpless and frustrated. It is a crucial match  In any other part of the world the match would be postponed. It should be.         
	There should have been a second (alternative) ground, at least a half-pitch. Now, we have not had any tactical training, he added. Lack of practice might not be enough reason to postpone the match although inclement weather could accomplish that task.         
	However, Bhowmick, who has happy memories of the Cooperage where he won the Rovers Cup many times as a player, acknowledged that the pitch was in excellent condition and said hed have no hesitation in playing if the conditions were fit.         
	East Bengals Rennedy Singh, too, agreed. If we have this ground (ready), we should play. Hopefully it doesnt rain tomorrow (Wednesday), he said.         
	The one good news for East Bengal is that Yusif Yakubu has arrived to boost their team. The Ghanaian might be off the boil, having joined the team here only Monday night after a long journey, but Bhowmick might have little option but play him.         
	How could I judge him without seeing him at practice, the coach wondered. But he is honest and trustworthy. I will go by what he tells me tomorrow.         
	On the other hand, the hosts would be in high spirits following their 1-1 draw against Churchill Brothers in the first round. Mahindra coach David Booth stressed on the importance of consistency.         
	We dont want to be an up and down team, we want to be a consistent team. So the attitude going into every game has to remain at a high level, he said.

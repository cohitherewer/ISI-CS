The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 1st Twenty20 abandoned
                                                   1st Twenty20 abandoned
                      
	Manchester: Englands first meeting with Australia since regaining the Ashes was abandoned Sunday after persistent rain wiped out the first of two Twenty20 Internationals.         
	England had been reduced to four for two in just 1.1 overs in reply to Australias 145 for four before rain stopped play.         
	After Old Trafford missed out on hosting an Ashes match, Manchesters cricket fans will hope Tuesdays second Twenty20 match at the same venue is not a washout as well.         
	Earlier, Cameron White had top-scored for Australia, making 55 off 36 balls after having been dropped when on 12 by Joe Denly, who was making his Twenty20 debut for England.         
	Having lost the toss and being sent in to bat, Australias Shane Watson was first out for 10, lofting a short, sharp delivery from Stuart Broad to Ravi Bopara at mid-wicket.         
	Captain Paul Collingwood next removed David Warner for 33, trapping him leg before.         
	He claimed a second wicket in three balls when David Hussey went for a two-ball duck as Matt Prior stumped him charging down the wicket.         
	White, who hit the first six of the match in the 16th over, was removed in the penultimate over when he was caught by Collingwood off Broad.         
	Collingwood finished with figures of two for 20 off four overs and Broad two for 33 off his four.           (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Curator: Kotla pitch sporting

	New Delhi: The sporting Kotla wicket is likely to assist both the batsmen and the bowlers in the fifth one-day International between India and Sri Lanka on Sunday, according to curator Vijay Bahadur Mishra.         
	Unlike the Champions League, the pitch this time is not going to be a nightmare for the batsmen, said Mishra. My personal assessment is the team that bats first should be able amass around 300 runs. But then, it all depends on how the batsmen use their batting technique.         
	The curator felt the wicket should remain fair to the bowlers as well. In the first hour, it is likely to help the bowlers. Though the wicket may keep improving, there is a chance it may play slow in the end, said the Delhi and Districts Cricket Association (DDCA) curator. The same pitch was used during the India-Australia match but this time the ground staff decided to leave some grass on it.         
	Initially, Mishra and his staff had a plan to use the pitch that was used for the Champions League matches. The curator was sure it wouldnt be as low and slow as it was during the T20 international meet.         
	However, the DDCA grounds and pitch committee chairman Chetan Chauhan did not like the idea and instructed the curator on Thursday to use the pitch that had hosted the India-Australia tie.

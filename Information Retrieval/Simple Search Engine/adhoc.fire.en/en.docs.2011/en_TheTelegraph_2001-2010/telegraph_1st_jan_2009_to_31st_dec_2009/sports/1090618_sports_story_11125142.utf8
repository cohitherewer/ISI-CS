The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Unbeaten SA vs resurgent Pak 
                                                     Unbeaten SA vs resurgent Pak 
            Our Bureau                Graeme Smith and Younis Khan                             
	An immensely confident South Africa will look to continue their unbeaten run against an unpredictable but resurgent Pakistan in the first semi-final of the ICC World Twenty20 at Trent Bridge Thursday. South Africa have been on the roll with their five-match unbeaten streak in the tournament, and they are the favourites to win the title after emphatic wins against the West Indies, England and holders India in the Super Eight stage.         
	But Graeme Smiths men, known for faltering in crucial matches, will also try their best not to choke again in their bid to reach any World Cup final.         
	The Pakistanis, mercurial as the unpredictable nature of a Twenty20 game, would look to rely on their bowling strength to beat the Proteas. South Africa have been the most balanced side in the tournament. Their batting has failed to fire twice  against New Zealand and India  but on both occasions, their bowlers rescued them with clinical performances.         
	Smith and Co. clearly have the upper hand in batting as the Pakistanis have failed to click as a unit in that department so far in the tournament. South Africa boast of A.B. de Villiers (185) and Jacques Kallis (174) as the second and third highest run-getters in the tournament while the Pakistani top-order has been ordinary with captain Younis Khan (148) not getting support from Shoaib Malik, Shahid Afridi and Misbah-ul Haq.         
	But it will be an intriguing battle for bowling supremacy with both sides having match-winners in their ranks. Pakistan will hope Umar Gul can repeat his record-making performance (five for six against the Black Caps). Gul will fancy his chances against Smith and De Villiers. Gul, the leading wicket-taker of the inaugural World Twenty20 in South Africa, is at the top of the bowling charts this time, too, with 12 wickets. His fellow right-arm spinner Saeed Ajmal (11) follows him at the second spot.         
	Gul and Ajmal have been ably supported so far by 19-year-old Mohammed Aamer, who have been bowling fast and accurate and it would be a test of character for the talented youngsters against the best batsmen of the world in the shortest version of cricket.         
	Pakistans fate, however, will depend on how their batsmen play the South African trio of Roelof van der Merwe (9), Wayne Parnell (8) and Dale Steyn (8), who have been doing an excellent job collectively. With seven successive Twenty20 International victories under their belt  a world record  Mark Boucher, a veteran, was justified in looking forward to the semi-final with confidence.         
	We have been in a couple of semis before, but there is a different feel about this team, he said. The management is different, there are new players and we have been through some huge tests in the last 18 months and we have come through with flying colours. We have handled pressure pretty well. Hopefully, that is a sign of things to come in the later stages of this tournament. It is great to be in the semi-final of an ICC event again and hopefully, this time we can go all the way.         
	Boucher made a particular reference to the victory against India in the Super Eights.         
	We have been in some tricky situations. Yesterday (Tuesday) was a tricky situation for us as well, playing on a wicket that probably wasnt the best but we managed to come through it. We do back ourselves. We have the players and the experience to do the right things at the right time. If the ball is going to move or spin for them, it is going to do the same for us, he said.         
	Pakistan, on the other hand, also do not lack reasons to motivate themselves. A World Cup triumph will certainly boost Pak cricket with most countries refusing to play in the trouble-torn country because of security concerns.

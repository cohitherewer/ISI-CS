The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mortaza eager for a chance
                                                   Mortaza eager for a chance
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: He has been flooded with calls, but Mashrafe Mortaza, Kolkata Knight Riders prized scalp at this years auction, does not know what to say to his impatient fans back home who want to know when he would get to play his first IPL match.         
	The Bangladesh pacer was the star of the February 6 auction in which Knight Riders won a tug-of-war with Kings XI Punjab to bag the pacer, shelling out a whopping $650,000.         
	The pacer has been travelling and practising with the team but is yet to play a match. It has been difficult, conceded the Bangla pacer, who keeps getting calls from fans back home, all asking when he would play his first match.         
	When I was signed up, I just wanted to bowl well and play well. I will keep working hard, the pacer told the IPL website.         
	But I am looking forward to getting chances and doing well, Mortaza said, hoping against hope. There are other guys also who are not playing. I am not worried about that. I am not thinking about it. I have to show what I can do and I will do that, said the pacer.

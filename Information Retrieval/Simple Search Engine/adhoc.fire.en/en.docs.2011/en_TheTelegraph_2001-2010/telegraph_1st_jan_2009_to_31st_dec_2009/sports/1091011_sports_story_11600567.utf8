The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wake-up time for the Delhi DareDevils
                                                     Wake-up time for the Delhi DareDevils
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            McGrath is likely to play Sundays match                           
	New Delhi: Faced with a must win situation to stay in contention, the Delhi DareDevils may turn towards veteran Australian pacer Glenn McGrath to deliver the goods in the Champions League Twenty20 match against the Wayamba Elevens of Sri Lanka at the Kotla on Sunday.         
	McGrath, a last minute inclusion in the squad in place of Paul Collingwood, was an enthusiastic figure at the practice session on Saturday and may replace a struggling Pradeep Sangwan in the do-or-die battle against the Sri Lankan side. The home team, hammered by Australias Victoria Bushrangers by seven wickets in the first match on Friday, need to win against Wayamba to keep alive their chances of moving to the next round from group D.         
	But then, bowling is not the only department where the DareDevils need to improve drastically. Against Victoria, the star-studded batting line up of the Delhi side, that includes Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Tillekaratne Dilshan and Owais Shah, performed miserably to be bundled out for a paltry 98. On Sunday, all these batsmen will have to come good with the bat to avoid bowing out of the meet.         
	Skipper Gambhir assured the fans that things would be different on Sunday against the Sri Lankans.         
	There is huge responsibility on me and Sehwag. From here, we have to win every game if we want to stay in the competition. We have nothing to lose and I am sure we will put up a much better performance in the next match, Gambhir said. He, however, was upset with the slow and low nature of the Kotla pitch and said it was not fit for T20 matches.         
	Wayamba Elevens are a formidable side, at least on paper. Led by the US-born Jehan Mubarak, a pleasant personality, Wayabma have some big names like former Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene, Farvez Mahroof, Ajantha Mendis and Isuru Udana, who have been playing together for two years now.         
	We know each other well. Our big advantage is that we have played together for the last two seasons. We are aware of each others strength and weaknesses, Mubarak said.

	Centurion: Left-arm spinner Wayne Parnell claimed his maiden five-for to help South Africa record a comfortable five-wicket win over New Zealand and bring back their Champions Trophy campaign on track Thursday.         
	Parnell wreaked havoc with his five for 57 as New Zealand were shot out for a modest 214 after being inserted by South African captain Graeme Smith in a Group B match at a SuperSport Park pitch which assisted the spinners.         
	The hosts then knocked down the required runs with an unbeaten 71 of AB de Villiers which ensured that they are back in contention for a semi-final berth after their 55-run loss to Sri Lanka two days back at the same venue.         
	De Villiers, who played a solid 76-ball innings, including nine fours, for his 19 one-day half century was hardly troubled by the Black Caps bowlers. He hit the winning runs  a boundary  as the home team reached 217 for five in 41.1 overs.         
	New Zealand bowlers, except for Daniel Vettori (1/34), struggled on an early season pitch that does not assist pace bowlers much. Shane Bond, who returned to International cricket recently, Daryl Tuffey and Kyle Mills claimed a wicket apiece.         
	South Africa made a sedate start but soon lost captain Graeme Smith for seven at team score of 22 in the sixth over. Smith, who made a half-century for a lost cause against Sri Lanka, fell to Tuffey.         
	One down Jaques Kallis batted with authority and shared a 52-run stand for the second wicket with the other opener Hashim Amla to ensure that the Proteas do not lose wickets at the initial overs.         
	Kallis, who made some elegant shots for fours off Bond and Tuffey, fell for 39 while Amla, who held the other end together for almost half the South African innings, was out for a 65-ball 38 to become Kiwi skipper Vettoris only victim.         
	Duminy, who came in for Amla, did not last long as he fell for 11 to a great catch from McCullum who held on to a bottom edge off a Mills delivery in the 27th over. Duminy, who scored a duck in the last match, could score just 11 off 13 balls including two fours.         
	De Villers, who walked in at the fall of Kallis in the 17th over, and Mark Boucher (28) shared 42 runs for the fifth wicket to take South Africa closer to the target.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Need to infuse young blood 
                                                   Need to infuse young blood 
                                  
	Our showing in the Asia Cup was nothing less than catastrophic. For the first time we didnt qualify for the semi-finals. That too right after the Azlan Shah triumph but then I had said that the competition in the Asia Cup would be much tougher.         
	In the last two years the performance of the team has gone down. Not qualifying for the Beijing Olympics, and now, finishing fifth in the Asia Cup.         
	This particular event may not have been a very happy introduction to Indian hockey for Jose Brasa, the new coach, but I am sure once he takes up the job in right earnest, he can devise some ways for the team to return to winning ways.         
	For me it has been a big disappointment in the sense I have been advocating that more youngsters should be included in the squad in 2009-10 because it will serve no purpose in continuing with the players who are past their prime.         
	Without mentioning names, I think there are at least four to five players who should have been sidelined with a view to building a team for our engagements in the next two years. There are major events like the Commonwealth Games, the World Cup and the Asian Games and we need the best possible squad at our disposal.         
	The IOA ad hoc committee is going gaga claiming that after they came at the helm the team has started doing well. What I have to say to this is that let us first understand that it is the Indian team and whoever is running the show is immaterial.         
	Unfortunately for India, we have always thought of the immediate task at hand much like Pakistan who seem to have had fallen in the same trap, as is suggested by the recall of senior players like Sohail Abbas and Wasim.         
	The next big event is the Junior World Cup in Malaysia and Singapore in June and if some colts are added to the senior side then we would have taken the first step towards striking the right balance in the mens team. The juniors have been drawn in pool D with Holland, New Zealand, Poland and Singapore and open their campaign against Singapore on June 8.         
	M.S. Gill has been retained as the minister of sports in the new cabinet. Gill had been doing a good job and was trying to do his best for Olympic sports. He had also promised 25 astroturf surfaces for the country and I hope he keeps up the good work and continues paying attention to the development of sports infrastructure.

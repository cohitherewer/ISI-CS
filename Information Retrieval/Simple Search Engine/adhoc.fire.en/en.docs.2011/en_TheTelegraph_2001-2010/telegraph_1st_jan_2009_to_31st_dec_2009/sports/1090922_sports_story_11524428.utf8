The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Grass passe, says Mahesh
                                                   Grass passe, says Mahesh
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mahesh Bhupathi believes hard courts should be the preferred surface for the Indian Davis Cup team and Chennai would be the ideal venue if India gets a home tie in the first round of the World Group next year.         
	I think so. The days of grass are over for us. Somdev (Dev Varman) has a game best suited for hard courts and Rohan (Bopanna) can play on any surface. Even Yuki (Bhambri) finds hard courts his favourite. If we get a home tie, Chennai would be a great venue for us, Bhupathi told The Telegraph on Monday.         
	India returned to the elite level of the 16-team mens team tennis competition after a gap of 11 years by vanquishing South Africa 4-1 in the World group playoff in Johannesburg last weekend.         
	The All India Tennis Association (AITA) maintained that the players would be consulted when a decision on the venue was to be made. First we have to see who are our opponents and the players views will be taken into account. The chances are that sixty percent it is going to be an away tie, so lets wait and see, AITA executive president Anil Khanna said.         
	The draw for the 2010 World Group is to be made on September 23 with Spain, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Israel, Belgium, France, Sweden, Serbia, Switzerland, Argentina, USA, Russia, Germany, Chile and Ecuador being the other teams in the fray.         
	It was a rare win for India in which neither Leander Paes nor Bhupathi had any role to play, and it proved only what the 35-year-old Bangalorean had said a couple of years ago, that the team had the talent to win at the zonal level without the two of them.         
	 I have always maintained that. I genuinely feel that we have the talent to win a match in the World Group  But lets take one step at a time. It would be great if we get a home tie, because we have been playing away for a while now, he said.         
	Interestingly, Bhupathi said that Rajeev Ram, an Indian-origin US player, would strengthen the team.         
	He is open to play for India, only that there are issues like the passport rule that has kept even Prakash (Amritraj) out. Both (Ram and Amritraj) feel rooted in India  if we manage to get Prakash and Rajeev to play for us, we have a great five of them, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni expects better pitch than Motera

  - SECOND TEST 
  -  Sri Lanka captain mulls going in with three spinners         OUR CORRESPONDENT            Kumar Sangakkara in Kanpur on Monday. (AFP)                                 
	Kanpur: Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni declined to make any premature assessment of the Green Park track, Monday, the eve of the second Test match against Sri Lanka, during his interaction with the media, but said it is completely different from the one in Motera.               
	The following are excerpts               
	The pitch         
	This is a completely different pitch from the one we played on in Motera. It looks a lot more grassy, although the base looks drier. I feel it will be a good wicket. But its difficult to predict how it will behave during the course of the match. The fast bowlers are likely to get more assistance. It is much cooler than Ahmedabad, and that may help the wicket to retain the moisture for longer. The outfield is not lush green, which means the ball will lose its shine quickly and there may be some reverse swing. Also, a dry base means itll show cracks and spinners would get assistance.         
	Lifeless Motera track         
	True, the Motera track was a flat one. We have aggressive wicket-taking bowlers who were certainly disheartened after bowling on a track as placid as the one in Motera. Having said that, I must admit that I have played on flatter tracks than that one.         
	The top-order collapse in the first Test         
	I believe each and every batsman has an individual approach of looking at things. I would really not like to get into that.         
	Ishant Sharmas form         
	Ishant is slowly getting back into the rhythm. He is showing signs of improvement, and bowled a few good spells during the first Test.         
	Sreesanths chances         
	He has been impressive at the nets. He got the ball to swing at a decent pace. However, I wouldnt like to comment on the team composition right now.         
	Playing on a newly-laid pitch         
	I have heard that no international match has been played on this particular strip since 2002. But there has been lot of first-class matches on it. Also, I am somebody who believes in speaking to the groundsman in order to get information.         
	Gautam Gambhir...         
	He has shown tremendous maturity in the last one-and-a-half years. He is one of our key players. He has the ability to shift gears according to match situation. He is equally good against the spinners as he knows how to use the depth of the crease.         
	Harbhajans absence at the nets         
	Harbhajan decided to take rest as it was an optional session. Hes fine.         
	Virender Sehwag not being able to convert starts         
	You dont need to say anything to Sehwag. He has his own style of batting. He is a match-winner. He is one player, if he sticks around for a day, can score a double hundred. Hes not one who will just hang around.         
	Whether he would like to bowl first if he won the toss         
	Just because we lost four wickets in an hour doesnt mean opting to field is a wise option. You have to judge what is right, giving the first hour to the bowlers or taking the risk of chasing a total on a fifth day pitch, which offers turn.

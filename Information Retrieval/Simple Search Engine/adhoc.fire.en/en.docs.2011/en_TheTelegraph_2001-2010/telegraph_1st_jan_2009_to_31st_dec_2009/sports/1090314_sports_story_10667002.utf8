The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | West do it in style
                                                   West do it in style
                      
	Cuttack: A pathetic batting display by South Zone enabled West register a 71-run victory in their group B opener of the Deodhar Trophy at the Barabati Stadium Friday.         
	Though shoddy batting appeared to be the order of the day, West captain Wasim Jaffer came up with a responsible knock of 81 to help his team post a respectable 223 in 49.2 overs after electing to bat.         
	In reply, South never had any partnership going as wickets fell at regular intervals. They were skittled out for 152 in 42.2 overs.         
	Five points, including a bonus mark, mean that the West have virtually sealed their place in the summit clash to be held on Wednesday.         
	West coach Debu Mitra said though the Barabati pitch was not best suited for a one-day game, his teams skills helped them win with a bonus point.         
	The wicket was not best suited for one-day cricket. However, its been a good performance... All of our players performed well. Even the bowlers did well and stuck to a line and length, Mitra said.         
	For South, Robin Uthappa scored a breezy 20 from 11 balls, including three boundaries.         
	Jaffer took his time to pace his innings. The captains patient 81 came from 110 balls and had three boundaries in it. The Jaffer-Ravindra Jadeja duo stiched 52 runs together.         
	Jaffer completed his 21st List A half-century from 75 balls. But when the duo were looking good, a smart change by South skipper S. Badrinath, bringing in Uthappa, fetched another wicket.         
	After Jaffer got out, Jadeja (39) too followed suit. He fell off a Ravichandran Ashwin delivery. The Saurashtra all-rounder hit three fours in his 44-ball knock.         
	Brief scores         
	West Zone 223 in 49.2 ovs (W. Jaffer 81; A. Sreesanth 4/41). South Zone 152 in 42.2 ovs (M. Sai 47; K. Makwana 2/17). West Zone won by 71 runs.           (PTI)

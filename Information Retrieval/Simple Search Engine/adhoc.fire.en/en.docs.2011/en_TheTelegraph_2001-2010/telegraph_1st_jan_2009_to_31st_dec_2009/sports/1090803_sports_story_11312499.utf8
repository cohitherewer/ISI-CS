The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pathan will bounce back: Akram
                                                   Pathan will bounce back: Akram
                      
	New Delhi: Legendary Pakistan cricketer Wasim Akram said he was surprised by left-arm pacer Irfan Pathans omission from Indias 30-member probables list for the Champions Trophy.         
	I have no doubt that Irfan is a quality bowler and will comeback to the India team soon. He should not have been dropped from the (Champions Trophy) probables list, Akram said.         
	Had I been a selector, I would have included Irfan in the team. But he is young, just 24-years-old, and has a lot of time to play for his country, said the fast bowling legend, who has 414 wickets from 104 Tests.         
	The BCCI selection committee, headed by Krishnamachari Srikkanth, last month left Irfan, who has 100 Test and 152 ODI wickets, out of the probables list due to his scratchy form.         
	Akram also advised the Baroda pacer to cut down on his pace and instead concentrate on swing.         
	He should not try to bowl faster, rather he should remember that he is an effective swing bowler. Irfan needs proper guidance at this point in his career because that will help him to get the required confidence, said Akram.         
	Akram is of the view that the present Indian pace attack is fast becoming a potent force in world cricket.         
	I think, India has a good pace bowling attack now. The team has Zaheer (Khan), who is a quality pacer and doing a good job, Akram said.         
	Ishant (Sharma) is a bit down but will hopefully find his rhythm soon. And there are also bowlers like R.P. Singh who can bring balance to the teams attack, he added. (PTI)

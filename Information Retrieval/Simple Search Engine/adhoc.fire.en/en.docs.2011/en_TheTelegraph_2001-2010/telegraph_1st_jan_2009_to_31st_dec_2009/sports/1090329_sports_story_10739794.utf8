    - team indias senior pro gives credit to new zealand spinners           A CORRESPONDENT                            
	Napier: Team Indias stylish middle-order batsman V.V.S. Laxman believes India might still do something special to save the Test match but stressed that the batsmen need to spend a lot of time at the crease in doing so.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Were India wrong in coming to Napier late?         
	I dont think so. We had good practice even in Auckland, in fact the practice facilities in Auckland were much better than the facilities in Napier. I think we should not relate the bad days we had on the field with what we did in Hamilton.         
	The partnership with Dravid         
	Both of us were looking to bat the entire day. It was unfortunate that Rahul (Dravid) fell just when the second new ball was due. It was disappointing that we were not able to continue because the way both of us were batting, we were confident that we could bat the whole day and set the team for a good total.         
	Can India save the Test now?         
	Yeah, definitely. We are quite positive. Weve done some amazing things in the past. We take a lot of confidence from what we have achieved in the past Its one more opportunity to do something special. We have done that in the past where we have come out of some tough situations as recent as in December when we won chasing a Test match getting almost 300 to 400 runs against England on the final day. So the team has the opportunity to do something special.         
	The wicket         
	Its a very good batting strip, and I feel it will remain the same.         
	What will be Indias approach?         
	I think its very important to play your natural game. You cant think the opposition has scored 600-odd runs. If you play too defensively, the bowlers will get on top of you. So its important that each one play their game. Everyone has got a different style of playing. Yes, its important to spend as much time in the middle. What is important is not only getting runs but spending a lot of time. You have to play your natural game and not play too defensively. You have to have short-term goals. It will be difficult to think you have to bat for two days. That will be a long-term vision but you have to set small targets. You go out and achieve those small targets.         
	Where did NZ score over India?         
	I think NZ batted really well. If you see, (Jesse) Ryder and Ross (Taylor) took the game away from us after we started well with the ball. 600 definitely is a huge score We should have been looking to contain them to 400-450. The wicket was really flat and our bowlers bowled well. The partnership between Ryder and Ross took the game away from us on the first day.         
	Were the Indians complacent against spin?         
	No not necessarily. Both of them are quality spinners. When you are playing international cricket and youre playing for your country, you are definitely not complacent. I think both of them bowled really well. Instead of thinking we were complacent, you should give credit to them for the way they bowled. I think they bowled really disciplined lines and lengths. See we all played our natural games, and sometimes while playing your natural games you can fall and get out. You should give credit to how the New Zealand bowlers stuck to the task,         
	Indias batting debacle         
	Even if you see their innings, it was two big partnerships that took the game away from us. It was unfortunate we were not able to carry on with our partnerships. Rahul and Sachin (Tendulkar) had a good partnership then Rahul and myself had a good partnership, but we werent able to make it a big one. That was the only difference between our innings and the New Zealand innings that we were not able to continue and get a big partnership going.         
	Pressure on Yuvraj Singh         
	Hes getting ready for the opportunity thats given to him. Its so unfortunate that in one innings someone fails, you put pressure on him. He has done tremendously well in both forms of the game. He has won us a Test match in England and played really well in the second Test in Mohali and recently had a wonderful one-day series. Hes an amazing talent who is potentially a match-winner and one of the best talents India has produced.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Red Bulls Webber takes pole

	Nuerburgring: Australian Mark Webber set his sights on a breakthrough first Formula One victory in Germany on Sunday after finally securing pole position on his 130th attempt.         
	The Red Bull driver made the most of Saturdays qualifying, with rain and shine producing tricky conditions, to keep the championship-leading Brawns and German teammate Sebastian Vettel behind him.         
	Force India too registered a first when Germanys Adrian Sutil, who has a reputation for going well in the wet, secured the Mercedes-powered team their first top 10 starting place with a surprise seventh in front of his home crowd.         
	His partner Giancarlo Fisichella, however, wasnt as lucky and posted a timing of 1:32:402 in Q1 and will start 18th Sunday.         
	Im really happy, for sure one of F1s happiest guys today. Its my home race and my best qualifying position so far in F1. Seventh position is just really, really good. Everything went perfectly. Our decisions were very good and on time, Sutil said.         
	Weve worked really hard in the last months. The car worked well. It was very tricky in the second session with the rain and we had to try on the dry tyres which was a great move from us, the German added.         
	Brazilian Rubens Barrichello, in a Brawn, will start alongside 32-year-old Webber on the front row with teammate and overall leader Jenson Button behind with Red Bulls German Sebastian Vettel.         
	McLarens world champion Lewis Hamilton qualified fifth, equalling his highest grid position of the season in a home race for engine provider Mercedes.         
	Toyotas Timo Glock was reprimanded and sent to the back of the starting grid for his home Grand Prix after stewards ruled he had impeded Renaults Fernando Alonso in qualifying. Glock qualified 19th, the penultimate slot, but Formula One stewards demoted him further for slowing down in front of the Spaniard during the first session in what they called a potentially dangerous action.         
	Alonso went on to qualify in 12th place. The penalty lifted Toro Rossos struggling French driver Sebastien Bourdais from last place to 19th.         
	Button (with 64 points) has a 23-point lead over Barrichello after eight races, with Vettel a further two behind. Webber is fourth overall with 35.5 points.         
	Webber, the first Australian to start on pole since 1980 world champion Alan Jones did so for Williams at that years German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, hailed his very special day after being so close in the past.         
	Were here, the team have done a great job and weve been quick all weekend, he said, appearing in a news conference with the Brawn drivers.         
	I am in a fantastic position to do it (take a first win), added the Australian.         
	Cars queued up to exit the pitlane at the start of the second session  and then all came streaming back in again to change tyres as sudden rain made conditions treacherous. Brazilian Felipe Massa went dirt-tracking in his Ferrari while Japans Williams driver Kazuki Nakajima also skidded off harmlessly.         
	That session was madness, said Button, winner of six of the first seven races. But it was good fun. We are struggling with tyre warm-up anyway but when you chuck a bit of water in there as well its quite difficult.         
	Further back, Brazilian Nelson Piquet  his future at Renault the subject of constant speculation  out-qualified double world champion teammate Fernando Alonso for the first time in his career and will start 10th.

	Ipoh: Captain Sandeep Singh continued his goal-scoring spree as India beat Pakistan 2-1 to reach the final of the five-nation Azlan Shah hockey tournament here Saturday.         
	Sandeep, the leading goal-scorer for his side in the tournament, struck twice, in the 28th and 60th minutes, to settle the issue in the do-or-die tie at the Azlan Shah Stadium.         
	For Pakistan, Mohamed Saqlain scored the lone goal in the 50th minute.         
	With this win, India, with eight points in their kitty, booked a place in Sundays final where they take on Malaysia.         
	Sandeep led from the front in the crucial encounter against the traditional rivals. The penalty-corner specialist scored on either side of the break and then ensured that India did not succumb to their perennial malady of conceding late goals.         
	The first goal came after 28 minutes of mid-field scramble when India took the lead to go into the breather leading 1-0.         
	Trailing by a goal, Pakistan came out all guns blazing in the second half and made repeated forays into the Indian penalty area before Saqlain equalised in the 50th minute.         
	Stung by the goal, India, who needed a victory to ensure their place in the final, attacked with purpose and regained the lead 10 minutes later with Sandeep again sounding the board.         
	Although Pakistan tried hard for the equaliser in the dying stages of the match, the Indian defence stood firm and ensured that there were no last moments hiccups.         
	Indias coach Harendra Singh credited the victory to a collective effort of the team.         
	As any India-Pakistan match, it was a tough game and the feeling was totally different among the boys. Win was important for us.         
	And the boys showed great grit and determination. They worked hard for the victory. The credit must go to them, Harendra said after match.         
	Although, India, who defeated Malaysia 3-0 in the group stage, enjoy an edge over their rivals in Sundays final, Harendra sounded caution and said there is no room for complacency.         
	Final is a totally different ball game. Malaysia will be a charged unit and will have the home crowd behind them.         
	So, we will continue to play attacking hockey and prepare tactics to counter Malaysias plans as we did in the earlier match, the India coach said.           (PTI)

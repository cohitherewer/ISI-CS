The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Imran: One-dayers need no changes
                                                   Imran: One-dayers need no changes
                      
	Karachi: Sachin Tendulkars idea of rejigging the ODI format doesnt impress former Pakistan captain Imran Khan, who believes the 50-over game has its own charm and there is no need to tinker with it.         
	Every format of the sport has its own utility and charm and it is better not to try to change these formats, said Imran, who is here on a two-day fund-raising campaign for his Shaukat Khanum Cancer Research Hospital along with fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar.         
	I dont think the growing popularity of Twenty20 cricket poses any threat to Test or 50-over matches if the international calendar is balanced properly, said the cricketer-turned-politician. Tendulkar had recently suggested splitting the 50-over matches into two innings of 25-overs each.         
	Imran said after Test matches, ODIs provided the toughest challenge to a player and the International Cricket Council or its member boards should not try to reduce the number of overs to 40 or less.         
	That will rob one-day matches of its real charm. Then it is better the ICC just focus on further popularising Twenty20 cricket, Imran said.         
	He, however, did not see any harm in the growing popularity of Twenty20 cricket since it filled the coffers and was good value for money for the spectators. But at the same time no one should try to change the format of Test or one-day matches. Let them co-exist, he said.

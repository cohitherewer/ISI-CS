The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Coventry dream over for Chetri
                                                   Coventry dream over for Chetri
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: East Bengal forward Sunil Chetris attempt to play in England ended in disappointment on Thursday when League Championship club Coventry City said they would not be pursuing their interest in the Indian striker.         
	According to reports reaching here, the Coventry City manager Chris Coleman, who watched Chetri at the trials for three days, decided that the Indian was not an option that they wanted to pursue.         
	A lot was made of him coming over and I think he is going to go around a few clubs. He has had a few days with us but that is it, Coleman has been as quoted saying.         
	I understand he has a big reputation in India and he is a very nice young man but we wont be following up our initial interest, the manager added.         
	The 24-year-old Indian striker, who has scored 15 goals in 34 appearances for the country, began his trials with Coventry City on Monday.

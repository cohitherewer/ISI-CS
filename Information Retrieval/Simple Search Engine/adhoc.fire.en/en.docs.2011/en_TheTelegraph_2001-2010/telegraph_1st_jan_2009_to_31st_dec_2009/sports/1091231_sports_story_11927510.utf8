The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB to change lights after IPL
                                                                                                                       7                                        CAB to change lights after IPL
            A STAFF REPORTER          Jagmohan Dalmiya                           
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) authorities have decided to use generators, relegating the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation (CESC) to being a back-up option, for the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) matches during the next edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	It was also announced that the association would go for an overhauling of the lighting system after the conclusion of the IPL.         
	Jagmohan Dalmiya, the CAB president, informed Wednesday that till they receive the report from the seven-member committee along with its recommendations, floodlights at the Eden would be operated on generators.         
	We havent decided whether we will hire or purchase the generators that will supply power to the floodlights. We have had a very long and fruitful association with the CESC. As of now, they will be used as back-up option. We would also be using generators of 1.5 MW capacity for the lighting of other areas, Dalmiya told the reporters at a media conference.         
	Time is very short and we cant change the lighting system in such a short time span. But once the IPL is over, we will overhaul the system. During the 2011 World Cup matches, there will be a new set-up in place. We will have lesser number of bulbs with higher power, said senior official Chitrak Mitra, who was also present at the press conference. Dalmiya also added that the committee, which was formed after the power failure during first edition of the IPL (in the KKR vs the Deccan Chargers match), had given seven recommendations, out of which six were complied with.         
	The president also cited examples of other venues like Mohali, Chennai, Jaipur and Hyderabad where the matches had been temporarily halted due to power failure.         
	There have been 14 instances when, according to the ICC guidelines, the Duckworth-Lewis method came into play due to a power failure of more than 35 minutes. But on last Thursday, at the Eden, the lights went off for less than 35 minutes, he said.         
	The president and Mitra spoke in the same vein about the fact that no system can be fool proof where the chance of power failure is nil.         
	If anyone can suggest us any such procedure, we are ready to pay professional fees for that, Dalmiya said.         
	Mitra, on his part, said that the CAB will not compromise on the cost as long as they can install the best set-up. We are not bothered about the cost. It can be Rs 10 to 15 crores But that is immaterial. We are aiming to have the best set-up, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India out of semis race 
                                                   India out of semis race 
                      
	Kuantan (Malaysia): Needing an outright win to book a place in the semi-finals, India squandered a two-goal lead to settle for a 2-2 draw against China and see their title defence go up in smoke in the Asia Cup on Tuesday.         
	Captain Sandeep Singh (31st, 34th minutes) converted two of Indias four penalty corners to put the side ahead but the Indian defence crumbled at crucial junctures to allow the Chinese to escape with a draw.         
	For China, Lu Feng Hui (45th minute) and Yu Yang (59th minute) sounded the boards.         
	India had lost 2-3 to Pakistan in their tournament opener.         
	Chinas tenacity and their ability to slow the pace of the game won the day for them against an inconsistent Indian side that played well in patches.         
	The Indians wingers, especially Arjun Halappa, was impeccable with his crosses but the forward line, comprising Rajpal Singh and Prabhjot Singh, was guilty of fumbling and mis-trapping the ball on a number of occasions.         
	However, Sandeep, who was off-colour in the first match against Pakistan, answered his critics in style, converting two short corners in a span of three minutes to see the defending champions go into the breather with a comfortable 2-0 lead.         
	Sandeep opened the scoring in the 31st minute with a fierce drag-flick that beat the Chinese custodian hands down after Tushar Khandekar had earned Indias first penalty corner.         
	Three minutes later, he doubled the lead with another immaculate short corner conversion. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pato brings smiles to Milan
                                                     Pato brings smiles to Milan
                  AC Milans Pato (right) celebrates with teammate Ronaldinho on Sunday                     
	Milan: Striker Alexandre Pato earned AC Milan a 2-1 comeback win over AS Roma Sunday to slightly lift the air of gloom hanging over the San Siro.         
	Roma winger Jeremy Menez, deputising up front for the injured Francesco Totti, ran on to Thiago Silvas mis-hit backpass to slot in the opener on three minutes.         
	Ronaldinho again offered little in open play but levelled from the penalty spot on 56 minutes after Nicolas Burdisso was adjudged to have fouled Alessandro Nesta despite Roma protests.         
	Brazilian Pato soon chested down a long ball and finished calmly to give Milan only their third Serie A win of the campaign before Wednesdays Champions League trip to Real Madrid, lifting them to eighth in the standings.         
	Milans Massimo Ambrosini was harshly dismissed late on.         
	Of course we wanted to do better than before, Pato said. We had a good week, Im pleased to have scored and Im pleased by the way Ronaldinho played.         
	Our training went much better and everything we did seemed to go better. We were together for the whole week with only one or two people coming back later (from international matches).         
	Earlier, surprise pacesetters Sampdoria failed to rejoin Inter Milan at the top after being denied a strong late penalty shout in a 1-1 draw at Lazio.         
	Luigi Del Neris side took the lead in an open game thanks to Giampaolo Pazzinis powerful header on 40 minutes following a cute cross from Marco Padalino.         
	However, Lazio hit back quickly when Matuzalem burst into the box to score and the second half seemed to be fizzling out once Padalino and Lazios Roberto Baronio were sent off.         
	Sampdorias Antonio Cassano then sparked the game back into life by striking the bar before the referee was unmoved by Pazzini being pole-axed in the area by Lazio goalkeeper Fernando Muslera.         
	I dont think he was even-handed with his refereeing, Del Neri said. Weve been punished like this throughout the championship.         
	The only person not to see the penalty for Pazzini was the referee. Whats serious is that he didnt even give a corner, confirming that the ball touched Pazzini and not Muslera, an angry Del Neri told reporters.         
	But Lazio coach Davide Ballardini insisted his team should have also been awarded a penalty.         
	There are a lot of things we could talk about, Ballardini said. There should have been a penalty for a foul on (Mauro) Zarate and (Sebastiano) Siviglia was fouled before the goal.         
	Ballardini praised his sides performance.         
	We had six or seven chances and its great that we can create so many chances against a team that is in form and as well-organised as Sampdoria are, he said.         
	Inter, who crushed Genoa 5-0 on Saturday, hold a two-point lead over Sampdoria with Juventus and Fiorentina four points behind the champions in joint-third after Saturdays 1-1 draw. Christian Maggios late goal gave Napoli a 2-1 win over Bologna on Sunday in Walter Mazzarris first game in charge.         
	Maggio converted a cross from Argentina striker Ezequiel Lavezzi, who angered Mazzarri by only arriving back from international duty on Saturday.         
	Colombian centre back Nelson Rivas hit his head after falling awkwardly in bottom side Livornos 2-1 home defeat by Palermo. After being rushed to hospital, officials said he had recovered consciousness and was not in danger. Udinese, who had to start with Serie A top scorer Antonio Di Natale on the bench because of a knock, lost 3-1 at home as Antonio Contes Atalanta won their first game of the season.         
	In other results, Catania beat Cagliari 2-1, Bari won 2-1 at Chievo and high-flying Parma overcame Siena 1-0.           (REUTERS)

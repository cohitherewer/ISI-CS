The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Our players can succeed overseas
                                                                                                                   Our players can succeed overseas

      P.K. Banerjee                
	The other day, I was pleasantly surprised to read newspaper reports that Sunil Chetri was going to England to appear in trials for Coventry City. In the hundred-year history of Indian football, only a handful of players have ever made an attempt to play professional football in England.        
	Sometimes I feel that many past and present Indian footballers should have tried their luck in England. Calcutta had a strong link with English football till the time of independence. It started in the last decade of the 19th century when Indian clubs like Mohun Bagan, Sovabazar and Aryans were exposed to competition against British teams in different tournaments.        
	Surprisingly, no Indian player from that period ever thought of using his experience and play in the highly popular English professional league football. I am confident that some of the Indian players of that era would have easily made a mark in England.        
	A look at the records would reveal that in those days Indian clubs had regularly registered many convincing victories against their English counterparts in Calcutta football.        
	The names that come readily to mind are of Gostho Pal, and Jumma Khan. Apart from being highly skilful, they were extremely tough players, perfectly capable of adjusting to the rough and demanding atmosphere of English football.        
	But then, there is no point in accusing our seniors. I think that some of the players of my time, including yours truly, had the requisite talent to play overseas but did not possess enough courage to venture into the unknown territory.        
	Quite a few of my contemporaries like Chuni Goswami, Jarnail Singh, Peter Thangaraj and Yousuf Khan received offers from clubs in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Formosa (Now Chinese Taipei). I too once had an offer from Yugoslavia. But I am sorry to say that none of us could make up our minds and grab those offers from foreign clubs.        
	I am not one of those who believe that Indian footballers do not have the ability to succeed in England. I know that football in England is more of a physical game than what we can imagine here. But I consider that a player having the right skills can always overcome all other difficulties.        
	Although Chetri has failed to make the cut at Coventry City, I still consider his visit to England was a success. After all, like Bhaichung Bhutia, Chetri too has shown the courage to take up the challenge on the bigger stage. His spirit of adventure will encourage a lot of other players in India to follow in his footsteps. He has done a great service to Indian football.        
	Chetri is a player with good and quick footwork. He also possesses considerable skills. The only thing that may have gone against him is his height.        
	Dear readers, please dont judge the ability of our players by the national teams Fifa ranking. Indias ranking may be low but we have enough players to pose a challenge in the highly competitive football market. Indian footballers should be encouraged to play abroad, especially in places like Malaysia and Singapore. Overall, it will help the game to grow in India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ferguson is all praise for Valencia
                                                     Ferguson is all praise for Valencia
            [+uc('Mark Ogden   The Daily Telegraph')+]              Alex Ferguson                      
	Moscow: Sir Alex Ferguson claimed Antonio Valencia was adjusting quickly to life as a Manchester United player after his first Champions League goal clinched victory against CSKA Moscow.         
	The 24-year-old winger, a 17m summer replacement for Cristiano Ronaldo, took his tally to two goals in as many games with the winner against Juande Ramoss team.         
	And United manager Ferguson believes that the Ecuadorean is grasping the challenge of playing for United following his arrival from Wigan.         
	Ferguson said: Valencia has been a plus point for the last few weeks. He is emerging very well, settling into the club, and his confidence is getting stronger.         
	He has tremendous assets for a wide player, but the assets he didnt show at Wigan were his goals, where he would maybe only get three or four a season.         
	This was his challenge when he signed for us. Two in two games will help him.         
	Victory enabled United to equal the record set by Ajax of 14 games unbeaten away from home in the Champions League.         
	Ferguson said: I think we should be proud of that because its not easy away from home in Europe. We have been to some fantastic places over the years, but theres a way of playing in Europe away from home, with maturity. You saw it tonight. We showed good patience and kept good possession.         
	Ferguson added: We took Rio Ferdinand off as a precaution for Liverpool on Sunday, as was the case with Scholes.         
	Ferguson said the pitch surface had not been a significant factor in the match.         
	As I expected, the artificial turf was not a problem for us, he said. We adapted quickly to it. I said before the game that if youre a good footballer you concentrate on the ball.         
	CSKA coach Juande Ramos said they were still confident of reaching the knockout stages.         
	Obviously, Manchester are the big favourites in our group but the other three teams are pretty even, Ramos said. I think we can fight with (Wolfsburg and Besiktas) for the other remaining spot.

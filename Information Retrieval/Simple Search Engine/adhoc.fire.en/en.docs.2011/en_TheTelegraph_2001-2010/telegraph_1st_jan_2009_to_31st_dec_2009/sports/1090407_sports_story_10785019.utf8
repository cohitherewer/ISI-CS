The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Adriano is in Rio: Agent
                                                   Adriano is in Rio: Agent
                      
	Sao Paulo: The agent of missing Brazil striker Adriano says the player is staying with relatives in Rio de Janeiro and its unclear whether he will return to Inter Milan. Adrianos whereabouts had not been known since he failed to fly back to Italy after Brazils World Cup qualifier against Peru last Wednesday.         
	The Brazilian football confederation confirmed in a statement Sunday that Adriano is in Rio and in close contact with national team coach Dunga. Agent Gilmar Rinaldi told local media on Sunday that the player was with his relatives in Rio and dismissed rumours he had problems with the police or was involved in an accident.         
	Rinaldi was quoted as saying that Adriano is facing serious personal problems and is home taking care of his relatives. The agent did not elaborate. Adrianos absence had prompted Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho and Brazil coach Dunga to express their concern at what might have happened to the striker, a member of Brazils 2006 World Cup team and a constant name on Dungas squad recently.         
	Gilmar told the GloboEsporte.com that Adriano wont return to Italy on Monday, and that he wasnt sure if that would happen at all.         
	We still have to decide a few things, Rinaldi said, without elaborating.         
	Adriano did not play in Brazils 3-0 win over Peru in the southern Brazilian city of Porto Alegre. (AP)

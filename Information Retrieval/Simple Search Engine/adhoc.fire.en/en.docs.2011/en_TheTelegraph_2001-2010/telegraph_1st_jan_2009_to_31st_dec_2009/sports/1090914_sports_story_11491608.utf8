                                                   Sutil: A great race
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A pit-stop fumble cost Force India their second successive podium finish but Adrian Sutil took the chequered flag fourth to win five points in the Italian Grand Prix in Monza on Sunday.         
	It was a great race and the car was performing really well. At the start we knew it would be really difficult to defend our position against Kimi (Raikkonen) and his Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) button, and then I was stuck behind him the whole race.         
	I was really quick but I just couldnt find a way past him as the KERS had such a big effect on the circuit, Sutil was quoted as saying in a release.         
	Starting second on the grid, Sutil could have done an encore of Force Indias podium finish in Belgium but the German fumbled in his second pit stop, missing the mark and nearly knocking out two pit crew.         
	Going into my second stop we had a chance to overtake him in the pit lane and I was pushing really hard but I was a bit late on the brakes into the box. I think I have to say sorry to the mechanics for going a bit wide. But still they did a great job there.

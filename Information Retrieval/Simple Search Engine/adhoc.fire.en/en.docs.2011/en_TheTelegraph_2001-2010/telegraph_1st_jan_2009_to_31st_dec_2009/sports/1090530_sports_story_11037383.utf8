The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zaheer still not fully fit
                                                   Zaheer still not fully fit
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Friday confirmed that Zaheer Khan was not fully fit and remained doubtful for the opening game of the ICC T20 World Championship to be played in England from June 5.         
	Zaheer is not fully fit ... he is likely to be fit by June 2 or 3, but I am not sure about that  I hope he is fit for the opening game, Dhoni said, before the teams departure to England from here.         
	Zaheer injured his bowling shoulder while playing for the Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and arrived in Mumbai only on Wednesday, after staying back in South Africa for further medical attention. Dhoni was also subtle in his reply to a question on the squad having no reserve wicketkeeper and the problems the team could have in the event of an injury to him during the tournament.         
	Hopefully, I wont get injured. Thats the only thing I am thinking about at the moment, the skipper said.         
	When pressed for a comment on not having a reserve keeper, Dhoni said, I dont want to talk about selection matters. You can ask the selectors.         
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary N. Srinivasan defended the decision to retain Zaheer in the World T20 squad.         
	I am fully aware of the rule that we should not send unfit players (for tours). I am aware of all the facts  the fact that he is going with the team means he is okay, Srinivasan told The Telegraph over phone. But Srinivasan refused to divulge the details of Zaheers injury and rehabilitation. I am not going to discuss the specifics, he said.         
	India start their tour with two warm-up matches, against New Zealand (June 1) and Pakistan (June 3). They play Bangladesh in their first match of the tournament on June 6 in Nottingham.

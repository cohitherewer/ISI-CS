            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Star India striker Sunil Chetri will play for Dempo Sports Club in the next season. The Goan club struck a deal with the Delhi boy on Wednesday.         
	Chetri, one of the most sought-after footballers in the country, had offers from a couple of other clubs but in the end decided in favour of Dempo, coached by Armando Colaco.         
	Colaco said the club would now approach India captain Bhaichung Bhutia to join their ranks. If we get Bhaichung, well have a dream pair up-front, Colaco said.         
	Meanwhile, Mohun Bagan decided to release Rahul Kumar and Henry Langte. It was also learnt that S. Malsawmtluanga may sign for Chirag United for the next season.

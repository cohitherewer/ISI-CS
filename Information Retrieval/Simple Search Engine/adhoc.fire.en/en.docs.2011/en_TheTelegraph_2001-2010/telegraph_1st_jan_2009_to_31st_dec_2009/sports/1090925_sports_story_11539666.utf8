                                                     Lenient ICC lets Nazir take field
                  Imran Nazir                     
	Karachi: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has allowed flamboyant Pakistan opener Imran Nazir to play in the Champions Trophy despite using a banned substance to cure his breathing problems.         
	A senior official in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed that there were some issues prior to the match on Wednesday, because the medication Nazir had taken for a chronic asthmatic problem is on ICCs anti-doping list.         
	The matter is now cleared because we had already informed the ICC medical commission about the medication being used by Nazir three years back when we faced the same problem before the 2006 Champions Trophy, the PCB official said.         
	Nazir had fallen ill after nets on Tuesday and was suffering from breathing problems after which the team doctor gave him the prescribed medication.         
	Unfortunately, when the ICC was informed about this development initially they showed reservations on allowing Nazir to play the match as the prescribed medication contained some banned substance, another PCB source said. (PTI)

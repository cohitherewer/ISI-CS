                                                   Ive no problem with Shukla, says Tiwary
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Manoj Tiwary denied he had a spat with Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla during the East Zone T20 tournament which concluded in Dhanbad recently.         
	I admit that our results in Dhanbad were poor. But it is not true to say that I had a spat with Shukla, Tiwary said on Monday.         
	In fact we are playing in the same team (Kalighat) in local cricket too. And I hope to play together for long in future. I have absolutely no problems with him. I regard him as an elder brother and have always been guided by his advice.         
	Tiwary said that the team, after their recent dismal performance, have marked out the areas they need to work on and are applying them at practice. He hoped that Bengal will be back on track shortly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sambaran told to stay away
                                                                                                                                   Sambaran told to stay away
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal has asked the state selectors to stay away from future team meetings.         
	Senior selection committee chairman Sambaran Banerjees presence at the team meeting Monday, the eve of the match against Baroda, had created a stir. It wasnt well received by the team management and some of the players, too, were unhappy.         
	From now on, the coach, assistant coach and the captain will decide on the playing XI. Obviously, the chairman of selectors will provide his suggestions, but the selectors will henceforth not be present at team meetings. Even the support staff (physio, trainer, video analyst) will not be allowed at team meetings.         
	None of the selectors can sit in the dressing room during matches. Apart from the players and support staff, only the president and the joint secretaries are allowed to enter the dressing room, assistant secretary Naresh Ojha said on Tuesday, after a meeting with coach Roger Binny and Banerjee.         
	Both Ojha and Banerjee, however, scotched rumours that the latter had threatened to resign, feeling insulted by the CAB move.         
	Nothing like that happened... Whatever I have done till now has been for the good of Bengal cricket. I will give my inputs over the telephone when the captain and coach select the XI, Banerjee said.

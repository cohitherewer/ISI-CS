The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB to take up players cause
                                                   PCB to take up players cause
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has said it would contact its Indian counterpart and also seek advice from its government on the national players chances of playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL) now that the tournament will be staged in England or South Africa.         
	The Telegraph had reported on Monday that the PCB chairman Ejaz Butt could request the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to be flexible under the changed circumstances.         
	Butt said there were a lot of issues to be cleared regarding the participation of the Pakistani players in the IPL.         
	I will be talking to the Indian board president and also our government. I am sure some of the players would now like to play in the IPL if possible, Butt said.         
	The decision, taken by Islamabad on February 2, had been driven by the awesome heat generated after 26/11.         
	Much water has flown down the Indus since and, while the IPL chairman, Lalit Modi, has stated that the squads cant be changed now, some of the Pakistani players could still appeal for a review.         
	Butt said he was not in a position to comment on whether the government would reconsider its stance on allowing players to appear in the IPL now.         
	The former Test player described the shifting of the IPL from India as unfortunate and said security issues and fears were playing havoc with cricket in the region.         
	Butt said Asian countries needed to stick together to ensure security issues didnt hamper the organisation of international matches and the progress of the sport.         
	Former captain Zaheer Abbas said he was disappointed by the decision to shift the IPL from India. Abbas said the shifting of the IPL would send wrong signals to the rest of the world.         
	Meanwhile, the Pakistani players who were not given permission by the government to play in the IPL, said they would be contacting their franchises and IPL officials to find out what their status was as far as playing in the league again was concerned.         
	We have to follow government instructions. We were told we couldnt travel to India, so we didnt go. But now if the IPL is being held in South Africa or England we dont think the government should have any objections in us going there and playing in the league, said a senior cricketer.         
	We will wait and see what happens because if possible we would like to play in the IPL after the series against Australia, another player said. Pakistans Younis Khan, Shoaib Malik, Shoaib Akhtar, Shahid Afridi, Salman Butt, Umar Gul, Mohammed Hafeez, Misbah-ul Haq, Kamran Akmal and Sohail Tanvir played in the inaugural edition of the IPL last year.

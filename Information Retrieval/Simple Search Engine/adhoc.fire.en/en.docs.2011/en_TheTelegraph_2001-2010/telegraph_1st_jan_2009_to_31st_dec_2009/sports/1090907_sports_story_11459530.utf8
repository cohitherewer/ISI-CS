The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Windies World T20 bungling revealed
                                                   Windies World T20 bungling revealed
                      
	Port of Spain: A former official of the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) has revealed that their national players appeared in the World T20 without signing the ICC squad terms contract till the quarter final, and were almost disqualified from the event due to the goof-up.         
	Conde Riley, who resigned as the WICB director Saturday, said West Indies came close to being disqualified from the event in England hours before their semi-final clash with Sri Lanka at The Oval on June 19.         
	When we went to England, we were required to submit (to the ICC) what is called a squad terms contract where each player taking part signs. On the morning before the match against Sri Lanka, Chris Tetley of the ICC informed the WICB secretariat that our team would be disqualified for the non-signing of these contracts by the players, Riley was quoted as saying by a news agency here.         
	On that morning, contact was made by Roland Holder (WICBs cricket operations officer) after Chris Tetley got in touch with him. Holder contacted then manager Omar Khan who then had to try and get these contracts signed to avoid our team being disqualified at the semi-final stage.         
	After much to and fro and with the approval of (WIPA president Dinanath) Ramnarine and the WIPA, the players signed the contract, said Riley, whose resignation came in the aftermath of the failed negotiations between the WICB and the WIPA on the players pay dispute.         
	Defending the WICB for not selecting the top players for the Champions Trophy, later this month, in South Africa, Riley said they were handed a similar contract but refused to sign on the dotted line.         
	This is a similar contract that was sent to the WIPA to have these players complete these contracts for formal transmission to the ICC (for the Champions Trophy), Riley explained.         
	Not a single contract has been returned to the WICB by the WIPA which would then have made these players eligible. We took the decision that, after not receiving the contracts from those who said they were available, these players had now made themselves ineligible. A deadline had to be met.         
	Therefore, as (WICB) vice-president Dave Cameron said the other day, we then selected the team from among those who had made themselves eligible by signing the contracts. I hope that puts that to rest.         
	Rileys resignation came in the aftermath of the failed negotiations between the WICB and the WIPA.         
	The WICB, on September 4, denied claims by the mediator in the dispute  former Commonwealth secretary-general Shridath Ramphal  who said the late addition of a new set of requirements from the board had derailed the talks.         
	The unfancied West Indies reached the World Twenty20 semi-final whereas much-hyped teams like India made early exit.         
	Pakistan finally won the tournament in England defeating Sri Lanka in the final. Shahid Afridi came up with a superb performance in Pakistans title-win at Lords in June.         
	India failed to progress beyond the group stage losing to England and West Indies. Their sole victory came against lowly-placed Bangladesh.           (AGENCIES)

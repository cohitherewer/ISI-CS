The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Buchanan calls for overhaul
                                                   Buchanan calls for overhaul
                          Buchanan      
	Melbourne: Former coach John Buchanan refused to buy the simplistic argument of Australia passing through a transition phase for the teams ongoing woes and said the tumble from the perch was due to systemic failure.         
	Buchanan said serious problems had been ignored by the cricket authorities in the country and the series losses to India and South Africa had delivered a fantastic opportunity for a complete system overhaul that is long overdue.         
	The man who twice took Australia to record Test match-winning streaks said it was simplistic to blame the debacle to a transition period following the retirements of the likes of Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Adam Gilchrist, Justin Langer and Damien Martyn.         
	There are broader issues there. Theyve been overlooked for a long period of time and now were starting to see the outcomes of those. Its systemic and thats been the case for some period of time but while things were going well people chose to ignore them, Buchanan told an Australian daily.         
	After the 2-0 defeat in India, Australia lost their first home series in 16 years when South Africa took an unassailable 2-0 lead in the ongoing three-match series.         
	Buchanan said he tried to have several issues addressed while he was in charge from 1999 to 2007, such as development, coaching and talent spotting.         
	He, however, sees an opportunity in the side to go for an overhaul.         
	I think the real upside here, the real upside for everybody, is that its a fantastic opportunity for administrators, coaches, players to stop and look at whats actually happening, and not just the immediacy of the results, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rehab has been fine, but match fitness is the issue
                                                     Rehab has been fine, but match fitness is the issue
    - Sehwag will need captain Dhonis backing to make trophy squad           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Virender Sehwag                                 
	Calcutta: With spearhead Zaheer Khan rendered hors de combat till the end of the year, at least, the concern now is over the second Indian victim of IPL 2009, Virender Sehwag.         
	Indications are that Sehwag, reinstated as the Team India vice-captain last November, will miss the September 8-14 tri-series in Sri Lanka. He may make the September 22-October 5 Champions Trophy XV, though.         
	Delayed by a year, owing to problems in Pakistan, the Champions Trophy is being hosted by South Africa.         
	Much, of course, could depend on the stand taken by captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni during the August 16 selection committee meeting in Chennai.         
	Sehwag, it may be recalled, was withdrawn from the World T20 (in England) and, then, underwent surgery on his right shoulder. The ICC-run tournament had begun just days after the IPL.         
	That Sehwag accompanied Team India to England despite carrying an injury had, according to The Telegraphs sources, left Dhoni annoyed.         
	Even frustrated, perhaps.         
	With good reasons, as Dhoni had one key player less to choose from. Initially, there had been some doubt over Zaheers availability as well.         
	Sehwag, one learns, has been coming through the Board-monitored rehab programme rather well. However, he wont be able to prove his match fitness before the selectors pick the squads for the tri-series and the Champions Trophy.         
	Ideally, nobody should be selected unless hes able to confirm his fitness out in the middle... Its going to be a tricky call and a lot could hinge on what Dhoni says at the meeting... He wouldnt like to end up in the World T20 type of a situation, a top Board source said on Friday afternoon.         
	Under the circumstances, Krishnamachari Srikkanth and his colleagues may overlook Sehwag for Sri Lanka, but pick him for the biggest 50-over tournament before the 2011 World Cup.         
	It would, as of now, be somewhat of a gamble, though.         
	As part of his rehab, Sehwag has been regularly visiting the NCA in Bangalore, but the match fitness bit needs to be settled.         
	Actually, Sehwags last appearance in any form was in the Delhi DareDevils versus the Deccan Chargers IPL semi-final, on May 22. Delhi lost to the eventual champions and Sehwag, the captain, got injured fielding.         
	Significantly, till late on Friday, the selectors were awaiting an update on Sehwags fitness.         
	Where the injury-prone Zaheer is concerned, the Board issued a statement saying: Zaheer is undergoing rehabilitation in South Africa (after surgery on his left shoulder) and is recovering very well... He is expected to return to international cricket by the end of the year...         
	The statement also mentioned that Zaheer would be back in India for 10 days, on Sunday, before returning to Johannesburg for the next phase of his rehab.         
	Ironically, Zaheer suffered the injury while fielding for the Mumbai Indians in the franchises match against the Royal Challengers Bangalore. He did feature in the World T20, but never quite came across as 100 per cent fit.         
	Meanwhile, Team Indias pre-season conditioning camp, towards the end of this month in Bangalore, wont be for more than a few days. Thats because of the Board-organised meet for corporates from September 1-8.

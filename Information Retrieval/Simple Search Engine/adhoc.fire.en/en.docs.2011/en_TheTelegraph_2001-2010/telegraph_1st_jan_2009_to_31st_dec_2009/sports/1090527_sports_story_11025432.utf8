                                                   Zaheer fitness issue
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The national selectors havent been told by the BCCI to pick a replacement for Zaheer Khan. Till late on Tuesday, it is therefore assumed that the pacer is fit for the World T20 in England.         
	Zaheer didnt play for the Mumbai Indians in the IPL after May 3. A shoulder injury suffered during one of the matches in the tournament kept him on the sidelines.         
	Zaheer apart, the Team India XV has four new-ball bowlers  Irfan Pathan, Rudra Pratap Singh, Ishant Sharma and Praveen Kumar.         
	The Indian squad, led by Mahendra Singh Dhoni, is set to depart for England on Friday to defend their title in the World T20 Championship commencing on June 5.         
	However, if Zaheer has to be replaced, it will be a toss-up between Laxmipathy Balaji and Munaf Patel.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Houghton comes out in Bhutias support
                                                     Houghton comes out in Bhutias support
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                    Bob Houghton (top), Bhaichung Bhutia                             
	New Delhi: The tussle between Bhaichung Bhutia and Mohun Bagan took a new turn Wednesday when national coach Bob Houghton came out in support of Indias most celebrated footballer.         
	Houghton, who arrived in the capital on Tuesday night, issued a statement on the All India Football Federation (AIFF) website saying he was surprised to find Bhaichungs commitment questioned, that too after the strikers 16 years with the national team.         
	Without naming the Bagan management, Houghton said it was truly inane to question Bhaichungs commitment as the Sikkimese player was one of the most dedicated footballers he had seen in his long coaching career.         
	Expectedly, the Bagan general secretary Anjan Mitra reacted sharply and demanded disciplinary action against the national coach for unauthorised use of the AIFF website to defame one of Indias most famous clubs.         
	I have already written to the IFA asking them to investigate how the federation website could be used as a tool against Bagan, Mitra said. Houghton has no authority to interfere in our club matters.         
	In a carefully worded statement, Houghton, who has so far refused to be drawn into any controversy during his three-year stay in India, said: I was astonished to see the commitment and dedication of our Indian team captain questioned. I have coached international players of more than 30 countries and I have never found a more committed and dedicated player.         
	To question the commitment of any player who has played at the very top level in his country for 16 years and has achieved what Bhaichung has achieved internationally is truly inane, said Houghton.         
	Though there is a strong feeling that to post the national coachs statement on the official website is a tactical move on the part of the federation to corner Bagan in the clubs versus national team issue, the AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco flatly dismissed any such notion.         
	We posted it on our website because Bob wanted to issue the statement. There is no point calling it our official view, Colaco said.         
	Bob too hasnt got into the controversy, Colaco added. He only chose to point out Bhaichungs high level of commitment as a footballer.         
	Bagan have recently raised the banner of rebellion against the AIFF by asking their players not to report for the national camp beginning next month. The Football Players Association of India (FPAI), of which Bhaichung is a director, has asked the AIFF to resolve the issue as soon as possible.

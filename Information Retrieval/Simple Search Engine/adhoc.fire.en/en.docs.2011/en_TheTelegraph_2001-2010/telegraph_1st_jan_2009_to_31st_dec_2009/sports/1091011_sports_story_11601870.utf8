The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Easy victory for India 
                                                   Easy victory for India 
                      
	Victoria: A dominant India scored in each half to blank Canada 2-0 in the opening game of their seven-match hockey Test series at the University of Victoria Ground here.         
	Tushar Khandeker struck in the 27th minute while Sandeep Singh sank home a penalty corner in the 66th minute to give India the opening win Friday.         
	India took time settling down in cold conditions under lights and were distinctly fortunate in not conceding the lead to Canada in the opening minutes.         
	India took the lead in the 27th minute when Rajpal Singh put through diminutive Bharat Chikara whose clever run down and pass atop the striking circle to the unmarked Tushar Khandeker had no answer from Canadian goalkeeper David Carter.         
	India dominated most of the second half and should have increased their tally soon but Chandi sent a back-hander over the crosspiece and Rajpal failed to connect a Vikram Pillay cross immediately thereafter.         
	Canada came close to scoring an equaliser on a couple of occasions but their attempts from Connor Meakin and Gabbar were foiled by an alert Indian defence. They also earned two penalty corners, one of which was saved by DSouza, while the other was flicked over.         
	Sandeep settled the issue for India after he fired home from their only penalty corner in the 66th minute to give the visitors victory.         
	The second Test between the two sides would be played here on Sunday.           (PTI)

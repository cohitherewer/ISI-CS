                                                   EB accused of foul play
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Snehashish Chakraborty, who led Bengal in the Santosh Trophy final against Goa, has accused East Bengal of forging his signature in a false contract paper and trying to ruin his chances of playing for Mohun Bagan.         
	Chakraborty, who played for Chirag United last year, is now awaiting the Indian Football Association governing body meeting on July 9 where his case, along with the Bhaichung Bhutia issue, will come up for discussion.         
	Last year, before joining Chirag and after serving out his two-year contract with red and gold brigade Chakraborty had to sign a declaration that if East Bengal wanted his services for the 2009-10 season, he would return.         
	At that time I had no choice because neither were they keen to retain me nor were they letting me go. But now when Bagan have shown interest after my great performance for Chirag, East Bengal have produced an agreement which, they claim, I have signed for an advance. I have told them to produce the voucher or the cheque number but till date they havent been able to do so.         
	Chakraborty said he was game for playing for any other club other than Bagan if the governing body decided he was free.         
	I dont want to sit idle and ruin my career. If it comes to that, I am ready to go to any club, he said.

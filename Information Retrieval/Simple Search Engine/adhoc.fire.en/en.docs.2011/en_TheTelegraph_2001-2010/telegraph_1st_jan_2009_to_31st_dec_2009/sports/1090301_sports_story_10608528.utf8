	London: Liverpool missed the chance to cut Manchester Uniteds lead at the top of the Premier League when they lost at Middlesbrough 2-0 Saturday.         
	Middlesbrough had not won a league match since November and had not even scored in five games, but Tuncay Sanli added to Xabi Alonsos first-half own-goal to push Liverpool down to third place and seriously dent their chances of a first league title since 1990.         
	The result left Liverpool with 55 points, still seven points behind the defending champions, who are not in Premier League action this weekend because they face Tottenham in Sundays League Cup final.         
	Chelsea overtook Liverpool on goal difference after a 2-1 win over Wigan, while Arsenal drew 0-0 with visiting Fulham for a fourth straight scoreless draw.         
	With Fernando Torres injured after limping out of Wednesdays 1-0 Champions League win at Real Madrid, Liverpool rarely threatened Middlesbroughs defence and were disjointed throughout.         
	In the first 30 minutes we had five chances and we didnt take them, Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez said. Its clearly been a problem this season and today was the same.         
	Middlesbrough had not scored in 527 minutes of Premier League football until Alonso put the home side ahead with a 32nd-minute own-goal. Stewart Downing hit a corner from the right that eluded a bunch of players before hitting the Spain midfielder and bouncing past goalkeeper Pepe Reina.         
	Tuncay made it 2-0 in the 63rd with a shot into the bottom corner from Jeremie Aliadieres cross and it could have been 3-0 but Reina got down low to save Gary Neils volley.         
	We knew wed have to be at our best and we were a threat going forward, Middlesbrough manager Gareth Southgate said. It was an important win for us. Were starting to score again and you can see the confidence coming back into the side.         
	Benitez took off Jamie Carragher and the injured Steven Gerrard but used his three substitutes without effect against a side whose 20 goals from 27 league matches make them the lowest scorers in the Premier League.         
	Chelsea had looked set to stay in third place after Wigans Olivier Kapo headed in Maynor Figueroas cross to equalise with eight minutes left. But Frank Lampard headed in Michael Ballacks last-minute cross to add to John Terrys 25th-minute volley.         
	The Blues have four points more than fourth-place Aston Villa and 10 more than Arsenal.         
	Villa host Stoke in one of four games Sunday, when Newcastle are at Bolton, Blackburn at Hull, and Manchester City at West Ham.         
	Robin van Persie came closest to scoring for Arsenal in the 58th at Emirates Stadium when he headed Bacary Sagnas right-wing cross onto the far post. Arsenal have now failed to score in four straight league games for the first time in 15 years and are just two points ahead of Everton.         
	Everton scored a goal in each half to beat West Bromwich Albion 2-0 and keep up their efforts to qualify for European competition.         
	Australia midfielder Tim Cahill put Everton ahead in the 36th minute and substitute Louis Saha rounded off the scoring 20 minutes from time with his first goal since November 8.         
	The win moved sixth-place Everton to 44 points from 27 matches and kept West Brom at the bottom of the standings with 22. Middlesbrough climbed out of the relegation zone, which now includes Blackburn and Stoke with the Baggies.         
	Cahill had already had a goal ruled out because of a handball when he headed in a cross from about eight metres, with goalkeeper Scott Carson missing the ball with his attempted punch.         
	Saha, who had been on the field for nine minutes, then turned on the edge of the area and put a low shot into the bottom corner.           (AP)

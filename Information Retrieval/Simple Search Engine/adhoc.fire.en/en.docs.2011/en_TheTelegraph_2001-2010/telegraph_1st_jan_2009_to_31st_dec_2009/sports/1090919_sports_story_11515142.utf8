                                                   Miandad satisfied
                      
	Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Javed Miandad believes the national players will benefit from the five-day coaching stint under him in the lead up to the Champions Trophy.         
	I worked very hard with all the players, especially the youngsters, and I passed on a lot of my experience and knowledge to them. I am confident you will see an improved and more confident Pakistan batting performance in the Champions Trophy, said Miandad.         
	Miandad, who is the PCB director-general, was appointed batting consultant by the governing council to work with the national senior and junior teams.         
	I laid a lot of emphasis on telling the players to be prepared to play long innings because the Champions Trophy is not T20 cricket. You need to bat sensibly and patiently in the 50-over mode, he said. Miandad said he had some reservations over the method of training of the players at the national camp.         
	I was a bit surprised to see so much emphasis on gym training. I felt that some of the batsmen have developed muscles that are too strong and tight. I have always believed batting is about pure timing The more flexible your arm and shoulder muscles and your wrist are the better you can play.

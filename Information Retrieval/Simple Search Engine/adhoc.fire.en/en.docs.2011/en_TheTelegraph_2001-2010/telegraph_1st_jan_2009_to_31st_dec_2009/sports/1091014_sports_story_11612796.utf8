The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Andy Roddick retires injured
                                                   Andy Roddick retires injured
                      
	Shanghai: Andy Roddicks body finally gave up on him when he limped out of the Shanghai Masters in the first set of his second-round match against Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka on Tuesday.         
	The fourth seed, who launched a scathing attack on the gruelling Tour schedule on Monday, was 4-3 up and looking to convert a break point when he pulled up short chasing a Wawrinka backhand and had to retire.         
	Lleyton Hewitt cut big-serving John Isner down to size with a 6-2, 6-4 victory in the first round.         
	Hewitt next plays Gael Monfils after the 11th seed crushed fellow Frenchman Paul-Henri Mathieu 6-2 6-2.         
	Sixth seed Nikolay Davydenko was the first man to reach the third round when he comfortably beat fellow Russian Igor Kunitsyn 6-4 6-2.         
	Chiles Fernando Gonzalez will play Davydenko in the last 16 after beating Brazilian qualifier Thomaz Bellucci 6-3 6-4.         
	Swede Robin Soderling is another in the hunt for a place in London and the ninth seed helped his cause with a 6-3 6-4 first-round win over Romanian Victor Hanescu.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Out of favour India bowler Irfan Pathan, who will be playing his first match after a two-month injury lay-off, felt playing against former India captain Sourav Ganguly would be a pleasure. Baroda play Bengal in a Ranji Trophy Super League tie at the Eden from Tuesday.         
	Weve played together mostly So it will be a different experience to play against him. But its always a pleasure to play with or against Sourav, said the left-arm medium pacer Sunday.         
	It will be a challenge for us to get wickets against Bengal, he added.         
	When asked who would be their main target in the match, Sourav, was the 25-year-olds prompt reply. However, on a more serious note, Irfan said that they aim to take a first innings lead. We would try to get a first innings lead, he said.         
	Irfan also felt that their coach Paras Mhambrey, who had trained Bengal in the past, would provide vital inputs about their opponents. His experience with the team would definitely help, he said. But he was quick to add: Ultimately its up to the players. We need to implement the strategies and adapt to the conditions.         
	Irfan had last played for India in June in a World T20 match against the West. A knee injury had forced him to skip the Irani Trophy.         
	On his comeback, the left hander believed it would be a gradual process. A professional cricketer has a short career span. Ill try my level best but then again, will take it slowly, he said.         
	Speaking about brother Yusuf, he said: Though his (Yusuf) reach as a batsman is more, I am a better bowler! Theres no additional pressure on us both.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhutia divides Bagan brass
                                                     Bhutia divides Bagan brass
    - Nobody is above the institution, says secretary 
	   - Club awaiting India captains reply             OUR BUREAU            Bhaichung Bhutia                                 
	Bhaichung Bhutia is unlikely to reply to Mohun Bagans showcause notice for allegedly neglecting club duties throughout the season and not accompanying the team for an exhibition tie in Jalpaiguri.         
	While Bhaichung is away in Mumbai for a television show, the decision has not gone down well with the clubs brass. Secretary Anjan Mitra signed the letter sent to Bhaichung on Thursday, and several members of the executive committee are upset with the way the issue has been blown out of proportion.         
	Bhaichung will return to the city on Sunday.         
	The India captain remained unavailable for comment, but a source close to him claimed that he was extremely upset with the attitude of some of the officials.         
	Bhaichung has been asked to explain his casual conduct within 48 hours, and advised not to join team practice till then.         
	He had taken prior permission from the coach every time he missed practice. How come questions are being raised now? Bagans decision to question his commitment has hurt him the most. Is this the reward for putting in so much effort for so many years, a Bhaichung confidant said.         
	Coach Karim Bencharifa termed the incident unfortunate. Its a matter entirely between the club and the captain I dont want to make any further comment.         
	Mitra said on Thursday that he held no grudge against Bhutia. I have very good relations with him and have no ill-feelings. I had to take this step as an administrator of the club, and Bhaichung too would have done the same had he been in my position. Personally, it was a tough decision and my hands shook while signing the notice, Mitra said.         
	Being a senior member and the captain of the side, he has been getting a lot of advantage. But it was high time we took a decision. Nobody is above the institution. Being a captain, he has to lead by example, Mitra added.         
	The club has fulfilled all its commitments and expects the same from its players. Ive just sought a clarification and will place his reply before the executive committee.         
	The club secretary also clarified that permission to skip practice sessions had been given only for a limited time but Bhaichung chose to extend the deadline according to his whims.         
	Bagan had promised the organisers of the Jalapaiguri exhibition match that both Jose Ramirez Barreto and Bhaichung would be available. While Barreto was excused because of family commitments, Bhaichung chose not to turn up.         
	This has caused the club secretary a loss of face The club has also incurred financial losses, a source said.         
	Bhaichung knew about the match well in advance and that has irked a section of the club administration.         
	What happens if Bhaichung decides not to honour his contract and leave the club? We will cross the bridge when we come to that Mitra replied.         
	Meanwhile, the AIFF executive committee will discuss the Football Players Association of India letter on the club versus country issue on May 22.

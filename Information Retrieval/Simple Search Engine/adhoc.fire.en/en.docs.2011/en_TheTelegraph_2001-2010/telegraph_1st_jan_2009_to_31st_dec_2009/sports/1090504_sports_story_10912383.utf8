The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fielding let us down: Brendon
                                                   Fielding let us down: Brendon
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	The Kolkata Knight Riders captain Brendon McCullum felt a score of 153 against the Kings XI Punjab was defendable but the fielding let them down on Sunday.         
	The pitch was on the slower side. It was a fine total. (Brad) Hodge batted brilliantly and his innings gave us a chance. We were accurate while bowling and had we fielded well it could have been different. The score was enough and defendable. Unfortunately, we put down some chances, he said.         
	The Kings XI Punjab captain Yuvraj Singh reckons that getting 50-odd runs in the first six overs played a significant role in his sides victory on Sunday.         
	We needed a good start. We got 50-60 in the first six overs. That was important. Sunny (Sohal) was hitting the ball really well and he did a good job.         
	Then Mahela (Jayawardene) was outstanding and shared a crucial partnership with Irfan (Pathan), Yuvraj said. It was a good toss to lose as I would have batted too. But it was better batting second. Our fielding was good in the first 10 overs. We got McCullum and (Chris) Gayle but after that Hodge played well, he said.         
	Man of the Match Jayawardene said that he was happy that he managed to stay on till the end.         
	I like to bat up the order. I wanted to see the pace of the wicket first, settle down and then bat till the end.         
	We kept the required run-rate under control despite losing a few wickets, and so there was no need to panic. Irfan batted really well, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spurs face Gunners
                                                   Spurs face Gunners
                      
	London: Arsenal may revive their Premier League title push with their new creative weapon Andrei Arshavin in Sundays north London derby while archrivals Tottenham Hotspur will turn to a more familiar form of attack.         
	With Jermain Defoe injured, Robbie Keane is likely to spearhead the Spurs strikeforce, making his first appearance since re-signing for the club from Liverpool this week and also wearing the captains armband at White Hart Lane.         
	Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger must weigh up Arshavins match fitness, with the 27-year-old playmaker having joined on Tuesday from Zenit St Petersburg during the Russian close season.         
	Having bemoaned his teams lack of creativity earlier this week, Wenger could be tempted to give the imaginative Russian a debut as the fifth-placed side bid to close the 10-point gap on leaders Manchester United.         
	With Manchester United not playing until Sunday, Liverpool can snatch back top spot on Saturday if they beat a free-falling Portsmouth who have yet to win in the league this year.         
	Rafael Benitez has told his players they need to tighten up defensively in the dying minutes of matches, although his side once again conceded late on in losing to city rivals Everton in their FA Cup fourth-round replay on Wednesday.         
	Liverpool could be without captain Steven Gerrard who limped off injured early in the first half against Everton.         
	Champions United, who have a game in hand on their rivals, visit West Ham United on Sunday knowing that their previous two trips to Upton Park have ended in defeat.         
	Local media have reported United striker Wayne Rooney could be fit for the match having been out of action since the middle of last month. (REUTERS)

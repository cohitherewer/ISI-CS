The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sreesanth is over-rated, says Hayden
                                                   Sreesanth is over-rated, says Hayden
                      
	Centurion: Former Australian opener Matthew Hayden has hit back at Sreesanth by describing the Kings XI Punjab pacer as an over-rated bowler who always loses cool under pressure following their face-off in their Indian Premier League (IPL) match here on Thursday.         
	Yeah, I think he is a particularly over-rated bowler. And so he was a great target for us to go at. He always loses his cool under pressure and I think it was a good example of that (in the match), he said.         
	Hayden hit Sreesanth for three sixes in the 17th over before falling to the same bowler. A furious Sreesanth gave a mouthful to the Australian when he was heading towards the dressing room.         
	Hayden, however, refused to reveal what words Sreesanth had hurled at him.         
	You dont want to know. Its just so meaningless. Mate... I am a Test veteran and a one-day International veteran, I have got nothing to answer to him thats for certain, said Hayden who holds the Orange Cap with 378 runs.         
	Many of his shots were definitely worth repeating. He was brutal against Sreesanth and dismissive against the spinners during his 89 off 58 balls.         
	During his international career, he was probably the batsman who practised the most before a game. He would hit a huge number of balls at nets. The rest of the Australians and the opposition would pack up and go but Hayden would still be hitting the balls. Its been no different in the IPL.         
	When asked how he was enjoying the IPL he said: Great fun to be back. Just going tuk tuk (he gestures his swipes over mid-wicket) and they are all connecting well.

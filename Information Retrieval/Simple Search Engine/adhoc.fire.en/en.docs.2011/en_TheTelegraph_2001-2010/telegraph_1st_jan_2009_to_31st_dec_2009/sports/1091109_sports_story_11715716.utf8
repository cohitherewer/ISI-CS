The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Injured Rohan out 
                                                                                                                                   Injured Rohan out 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Rohan Gavaskar has been ruled out of Bengals Ranji Trophy Super League tie against Baroda that gets underway at the Eden from Tuesday.         
	Rohan is suffering from a groin injury, which he picked up during Bengals opener against Maharashtra in Pune, and will be out for the next 10 days. Anustup Majumdar has replaced him in the squad.         
	Bengal are already without Manoj Tiwary, Ashok Dinda and Wriddhiman Saha, who have been selected in the Board Presidents XI side to play against Sri Lanka in Mumbai from Wednesday.         
	Anustup, however, has played against Baroda earlier. In the 2007-08 season, when Baroda thrashed Bengal by an innings and 59 runs, Anustup scored 103 in the first innings.         
	Arindam Ghosh is also in the running to take Rohans place in the XI.         
	Coach Roger Binny, who wasnt there in Pune because of personal reasons, joined the side on Sunday.         
	Pacer Ranadeb Bose, who took 10 wickets against Maharashtra, said: Each session will be tough with our batting and bowling line-up weakened. However, Sourav Gangulys presence will inspire us, he said.         
	The Baroda team, too, seems to be in some trouble. Choosing not to bring the three bowlers who were hauled up for suspect action in their last tie against Delhi, including seasoned left-arm spinner Rajesh Pawar, coach Paras Mhambrey tried looking at the positives.         
	Its unfortunate for Pawar, Mhambrey said after practice.         
	But we are very happy to have Irfan Pathan joining us besides having his brother Yusuf in the team, the former Bengal coach added.

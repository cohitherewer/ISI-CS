The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Grim Gay ready to take on Bolt
                                                     Grim Gay ready to take on Bolt
            Ian Chadband    
	Berlin: One sat polo-shirted on a stool in a sophisticated hotel answering questions quietly and soberly; the other paraded on stage in a tropical-themed nightclub wearing a ludicrous pair of foam arms and brandishing a pair of shiny orange shoes he called Yams.         
	One was attending a press conference, the other looked to be the star attraction at a circus. One was all business, the other all showbusiness. One called it a battle the other shrugged it was just a race.         
	And after all the silly prelims to what appears to be the only story in town at these World Championships which begin here on Saturday, Tyson Gay and Usain Bolt, in their very different ways, made it clear they believe the winner of their 100m duel on Sunday night here, with Bolts world record of 9.69sec under distinct threat, will have the right to be called the best sprinter of all time.         
	If that is athletics hyping it up, then, goodness knows, a down-at-heel sport could do with a bit of over-selling. The track has not had a 100m showdown like this to savour since Carl Lewis and Ben Johnson went head-to-head before the latter even knew how to stutter stanozolol.         
	And dont the organisers know it. On giant billboards around the city, you see the legend Grossen duell painted high. The whole championship is built around the race between the rejuvenated double world champion from America and the freakish double Olympic champion from Jamaica.         
	That Bolt should represent one German shoe giant, Puma, and Gay another, Adidas, is all grist to the money mill here, too. Then stage it in the 1936 Olympics arena, mix some wistful talk about the spirit of Jesse Owens, throw in Asafa Powell and you have yourself a marketing mans dream.         
	But let there be no argument about the premier attraction.         
	So how was Bolts fitness following his car crash this spring? Im ready, he said. What, 80 per cent, 90 per cent? Im ready, he repeated. The man did not look unduly worried. As usual, he was so laid back as to be almost comatose.         
	At the African dance club which his shoe sponsors had turned into a Jamaican village for an afternoon, he sauntered on stage, watched by his nations admiring sports minister, wearing a pair of daft foam, pointing Bolt Arms.         
	What was that all about? Well, the said appendages enable him to do his now-fabled pantomime celebration of an archer drawing his bow without actually having to move his real arms. Energy-saving, explains Bolt. Naturally, we were allowed to ask him about foam arms but not the alleged Jamaican drugs scandal.         
	So back to his new spikes then. The gold ones are gone; his new ones are called Yams. When I was small I ate a lot of yam. My dad farmed them, he explained. How his opponents might wish he really was weighed down by a pair of root vegetables; it could be the only way to beat him.         
	Gay is convinced otherwise. Sometimes we forget how good the 27 year-old is but he hasnt. That he is the fastest in the world this season 9.77sec in Rome last month, while Bolt has clocked 9.79sec  has reminded the sport of why he won the 100m, 200m and sprint relay gold at the Osaka World Championships two years ago before injury and the full flowering of the Bolt phenomenon checked him last year.         
	Now, asked if this race will decide the best of all time, Gay said: I believe so. I believe Usain is going to try to break the world record, why wouldnt he? If hes going to do 9.6 thats what Im going to do as well.         
	The world record is the number I have in my mind. I believe 9.60 is attainable, hopefully anything under 9.69.         
	Had Bolt been following Gays impressive progress? I wouldnt say that but its hard not to because he keeps telling me what times hes run, said the Jamaican with a smile.         
	He sounded about as worried as Ricky Ponting preparing to face an England attack armed with new yams.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

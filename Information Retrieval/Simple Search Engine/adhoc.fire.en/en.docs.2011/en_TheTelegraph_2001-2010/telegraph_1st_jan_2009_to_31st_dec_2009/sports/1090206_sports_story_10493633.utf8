                                                     Becks wants to stay at AC Milan
          
	Glasgow: David Beckham wants to make his stay at AC Milan permanent and leave the Los Angeles Galaxy.         
	The England midfielders three-month stint in Italy is due to end on March 8, but after impressing in Serie A he wants to cut short his five-year contract with Major League Soccer.         
	Beckham made the announcement Wednesday after playing the first half of Milans 2-2 friendly draw at Glasgow Rangers.         
	At the moment my lawyers are not talking to the Galaxy but I have expressed my desire to stay at AC Milan now and its just down to Milan and Galaxy to come to an agreement, Beckham said. I have enjoyed my time here. I knew I would enjoy it but I didnt expect to enjoy it as much as I have and do as well as I have.         
	Since arriving, Beckham has scored twice and helped lift Milan up to second in Serie A standings.         
	Ive expressed my desire to stay here for a while but at the moment Im still a Galaxy player, Beckham said. I respect the Galaxy and everything they have done for me. They have always been great to me.         
	But I hope they can come to an agreement and its down to the clubs now. At this point its out of my hands. Ive said what my feelings are to both clubs.           (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zimbabwe win
                                                   Zimbabwe win
                      
	Dhaka: Left-arm spinner Raymond Price returned career best figures with bat and ball to guide Zimbabwe to a two-wicket win over Bangladesh in the first one-day International on Monday.         
	Price took four for 22 as Bangladesh were bowled out for 124, then hit an unbeaten 23 from 52 balls as Zimbabwe passed their target with four balls to spare. Prices bowling figures and his knock of 23 are his best in one-dayers.         
	The hosts had Zimbabwe in deep trouble at 44 for six with Mashrafe Mortaza and left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan claiming three wickets apiece.         
	But debutant Malcolm Waller and skipper Prosper Utseya steadied the innings with 24 and 21 runs respectively before a 35-run stand between Price and Tawanda Mupariwa (10 not out) proved decisive.         
	Price and Keith Dabengwa (three for 15) had earlier helped restrict Bangladesh to 124. Roqibul Hassan top-scored with 28.           (REUTERS)

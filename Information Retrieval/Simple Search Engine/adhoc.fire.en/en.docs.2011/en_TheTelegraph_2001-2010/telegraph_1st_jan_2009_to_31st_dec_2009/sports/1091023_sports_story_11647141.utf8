            A STAFF REPORTER            Eduardo at the Mohammedan Sporting ground on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Eduardo scored a brace as Mohammedan Sporting made a winning start to their 2009 Calcutta Football League campaign, defeating Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) 2-0 at the club ground on Thursday.         
	After a barren first half, Eduardo drew first blood in the 51st minute with a 23-yard free kick that took a wicked deflection off CPTs Rajiv Ekka and hit the back of the net. Then, five minutes before close, a lob from substitute Sashti Duley saw the Brazilian beating the off-side trap to hit a rasping volley which crashed into the far corner giving rival goalkeeper Arindam Ghosh hardly a chance to move.         
	CPT got a chance to equalise minutes after the first goal when Sporting goalkeeper Naseem Akhtar brought frontliner Henry down inside the box. Naseem, however, made amends as he anticipated well to dive to his right and save Ekkas penalty. Had CPT got the goal then it could have been a different story.         
	Sporting could have won by a bigger margin had Theodore Sunday, Bapi Choudhury and Jyothi Kumar shown a little more enterprise in front of goal. Sunday, who played his first match after an eight-month injury layoff, missed two sitters and was denied by a smart Arindam Ghosh save on one occasion.         
	Despite the misses, Sunday was very impressive playing a full match and moved well in front of the CPT defence, allowing Eduardo and Choudhury to take advantage of the free space. Gradually, when Sunday gets back to his usual self, he and Eduardo will prove quite a handful for rival defences. Under-19 player Choudhury also caught the eye with his smart runs down the left.         
	CPT did not look like having the wherewithal to trouble Sporting and unless coach Biswajit Bhattacharya finds the right combination fast, they will have a mountain to climb in the CFL this year.         
	If there was a complete communication breakdown amongst the back four, the midfield did not at all function like a cohesive unit. And that reduced frontliners Henry and Ekka to mere bystanders.         
	Barring the move which earned the penalty, not for once did CPT manage to put together a decent attack. They were that bad on Thursday.         
	But the Sporting fans did not complain much as Eduardo was in full flow. He literally toyed with the CPT players and had luck favoured him, the Brazilian could have got a hattrick, that too in style.         
	In the 76th minute his corner from the left dipped and hit the base of the far post. It was an amazing attempt, one hardly seen on the Maidan these days. Had an unmarked Duley followed the ball even he could have got his name in the scoresheet!         
	Eduardo seems to have hit it off well with the fans too. If his first goal saw him do a series of somersaults before he climbed the fence to pep up the delirious fans, the second saw an even more boisterous celebration. But referee Rathin Mukherjee was not amused and rightly booked the euphoric Brazilian.         
	Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali was happy with the result. It was nice to start with a win. These three points was very vital for us, he said.         
	Shabbir said Naseems penalty save immediately after Mohammedan Sportings first goal was the turning point of the match. That equaliser would have made things difficult for us, Shabbir said.         
	About Theodore Sunday, Shabbir said the Liberian was impressive. He will take some time since he is playing for the first time after eight months. But he was good on the day. He made a lot of movement, which kept their defenders on tenterhooks.         
	Shabbir said that Eduardo and Sunday will be a quite a handful in the future. They have started well and I hope they will continue to shine. We also have Dipendu Biswas and Nilendra Dewan on the bench so goal scoring wont be a problem for us.         
	Calcutta Port Trust coach Biswajit Bhattacharya said that inexperience did his team in. We have too many youngsters. They will take time to settle down. But I must admit Mohammedan Sporting was the better team on the day, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Daunting task ahead of England
                                                   Daunting task ahead of England
                      
	Johannesburg: Still licking the wounds of their recent thrashing at the hands of Australia, a jittery England have a daunting task to stop a confident Sri Lanka, when they open their ICC Champions Trophy campaign at the New Wanderers here Friday.         
	After the Ashes euphoria, England were drubbed by Australia in the one-day series that followed, and will have to pull up their socks.         
	Sri Lanka, on the other hand, have already beaten hosts and favourite South Africa in their opening match, and will be keen to keep the momentum going.         
	England must find a way to get rid of Tillekaratne Dilshan, who is in red-hot form these days, early. If he gets his way along with the equally explosive Sanath Jayasuriya, England bowlers will be in for severe punishment.         
	Dealing with Ajantha Mendis and Muttiah Muralidharan, plus unorthodox Lasith Malinga, is another stiff challenge awaiting England. Strauss himself admitted that tackling Mendis would be a tough task.         
	We have not played Mendis, and some of their seam bowlers before. You can have a look at a footage of him, but it is only in the middle that you can be really sure of how he bowls and what his variations are, he said.         
	It requires us to think pretty quick on our feet. There are some fundamentals you have to keep in mind against someone like him, but it is a new challenge. We have played against Murali and Malinga, but Mendis is new, Strauss said.

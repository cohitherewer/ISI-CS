	Indian Wells: Indias Leander Paes advanced in the doubles, but Sania Mirzas campaign at the BNP Paribas Open came to an end after a straight-set loss to Italian Flavia Pennetta in the second round of the womens singles event, here on Sunday.         
	Sania lost 3-6, 4-6 after battling it out for over an hour against the Italian, who now leads the head-to-head record 3-2.         
	The fourth-seeded pair of Paes and Lukas Dlouhy of Czech fought hard 6-4, 3-6, 10-8 to beat unseeded Austrians Julian Knowle and Jurgen Melzer in the opening round.         
	Paes and Dlouhy will now face Argentines Juan Martin Del Potro and David Nalbandian.         
	Meanwhile, second seed Roger Federer beat Frenchman Marc Gicquel 7-6 (4), 6-4 in the second round. Federers possible semi-final rival, No. 4 seed Andy Murray of Britain, wasnt at his best but still defeated Spaniard Albert Montanes 7-5, 6-3.         
	American James Blake, the No. 13 seed, beat Jarkko Nieminen of Finland, 6-3, 6-7 (6), 6-3, while 17th-seeded Fernando Gonzalez of Chile got past Australias Lleyton Hewitt, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, reprising his win at the Australian Open.         
	Federer said he felt fit. A bit rusty maybe. Im happy Ive won. Thats always most important.         
	Murray said essentially the same thing after his win while complaining of being tired due to a heavy early season schedule.         
	In the womens, No. 2 seed Jelena Jankovic of Serbia was upset by 17-year-old Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-4, 6-4.         
	The loss continued an early season slump by Jankovic, who finished last year ranked No. 1, but changed her training routine during the off-season and said she lost mobility in the process.         
	Reigning champion and No. 5 seed Ana Ivanovic of Serbia began her quest for a second straight title with a 6-4, 6-3 win over Anastasiya Yakimova of Belarus and mens No. 11 seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France beat Teimuraz Gabashvili of Russia, 7-5, 6-3.         
	Number seven seed Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland beat Samantha Stosur of Australia, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5, to join younger sister Urszula Radwanka in the third round. Urszula Radwanka, ranked No. 107 to her sisters No. 10, provided an upset the previous day by beating No. 6 seed Svetlana Kuznetsova.

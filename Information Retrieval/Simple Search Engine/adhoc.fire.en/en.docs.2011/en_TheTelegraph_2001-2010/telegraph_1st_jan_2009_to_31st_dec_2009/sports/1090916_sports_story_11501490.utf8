The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhutia, Bagan face-off today
                                                   Bhutia, Bagan face-off today
            OUR BUREAU                      
	Calcutta/ New Delhi: Bhaichung Bhutia will come face-to-face with Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra when they meet the All India Football Federation (AIFF)-appointed arbitrator, Amarendra Sharan at his residence in New Delhi on Wednesday. Mohun Bagan finance secretary Debasish Dutta will be accompanying Mitra.         
	After months of quibbling, this will be the first time the warring parties come face to face. Sharan is likely to give a ruling on the Bhutia transfer imbroglio at the meeting.         
	However, even if the ruling goes in Bhutias favour the Durand Cup committee has put paid to the strikers hopes of playing in the tournament.         
	Both Bagan and East Bengal, who were hoping to get the services of the India captain and had even left a slot open in their respective registration forms, were told by the tournament committee they would have to fill up the same at least two hours before their opening encounter.         
	As per the Durand Cup rules, all the teams have to complete their registrations two hours before their first match. No fresh registration would be allowed after that, said a tournament official.         
	While Bhutia and the Mohun Bagan officials are set to meet Sharan at 5pm, Mohun Bagans match against ONGC is scheduled at 4.30pm, followed by the East Bengal-Lajong match at 6.30pm.         
	Meanwhile, Mohun Bagan, who had an emergent executive committee metting on Tuesday, decided to send a letter to the AIFF asking why Bhaichung was getting special treatment.

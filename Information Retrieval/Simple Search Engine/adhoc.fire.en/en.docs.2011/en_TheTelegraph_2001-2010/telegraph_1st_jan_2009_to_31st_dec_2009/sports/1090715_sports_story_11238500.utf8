                                                     Lloyd: Cup is No.1 event
            A STAFF REPORTER            Two-time World Cup-winning captain Clive Lloyd of the West Indies (from left), Aravinda de Silva, vice-captain of the Cup-winning Sri Lankan side of 1996, Michael Bevan, a member of the Australian teams which won the 1999 and 2003 titles, Dilip Vengsarkar and Balwinder Singh Sandhu, who were part of Indias Cup-winning squad in 1983, with the World Cup in Mumbai on Tuesday                           
	Calcutta: Cricketing legend Clive Lloyd, who had the opportunity to lay his hands on the World Cup twice, in 1975 and 1979, as the captain of the West Indies, said the competition was still the premier event of the sport.         
	The World Cup is the premier competition. It is a great spectacle and it is a great place for players to showcase their talent, as well as for Associate players and teams to make a name for themselves, Lloyd was quoted as saying in an International Cricket Council (ICC) release.         
	The logo for the 2011 World Cup was unveiled Tuesday in Mumbai by the ICC and was attended by Lloyd, former India cricketers Balwinder Singh Sandhu and Dilip Vengsarkar, ex-Sri Lanka batsman Aravinda de Silva and Australias Michael Bevan among others.         
	Lloyd said: It was wonderful to play in it and, now, I love watching it. It is evolving all the time and 2011 should be a superb occasion.         
	Kapil Devs India dethroned Lloyds side in the 1983 final.         
	When we arrived in England for the World Cup, making it to the semi-final was a distant dream. So much so that some of the players had already booked flights from London to go to the US to play a few exhibition games. So you can imagine what must have happened when we started winning, Kapil said in the statement.         
	I slept well the night before the final as there was no pressure on us. But when we did win eventually, I had to pinch myself to see if it was still a dream.         
	For a moment I went blank standing on the Lords balcony, with the World Cup in my hands, the all-rounder said.

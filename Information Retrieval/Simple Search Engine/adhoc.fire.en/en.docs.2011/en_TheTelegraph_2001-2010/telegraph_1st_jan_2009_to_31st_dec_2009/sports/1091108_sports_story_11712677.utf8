The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Somdev in semis 
                                                                                                                                   Somdev in semis 
                      
	New Delhi: Somdev Dev Varman extended his brilliant run at the ATP Challenger event in Charlottesville, in USA, to the semi-finals, but it was curtains for compatriot Sanam Singh, who lost a hard fought quarter final match.         
	Third seed Somdev hardly had any trouble to see off the challenge of Dutch Matwe Middelkoop as he scored a 6-3, 6-4 win in the quarters of the $50,000 hard court event.         
	He will now fight it out with American fifth seed and wild card Ryan Sweeting for a place in the final. Sweeting shocked top seed Michael Russell 6-2, 3-6, 7-6(1).         
	Sanam, who returned to professional circuit after a long period, lost the quarter-final 5-7, 7-6(3), 6-7(5) to world No. 87 American Kevin Kim.

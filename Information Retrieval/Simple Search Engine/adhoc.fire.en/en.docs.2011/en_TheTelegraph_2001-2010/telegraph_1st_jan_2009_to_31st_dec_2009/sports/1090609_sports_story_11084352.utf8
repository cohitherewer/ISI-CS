  -  Former India captain speaks on his new innings                 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL                             
	Nottingham: Former India captain Anil Kumble made his debut as a full-fledged TV commentator here on Saturday. On Sunday, over coffee at the Crowne Plaza, he spoke to The Telegraph on his new innings.               
	The following are excerpts               
	First day on television         
	(Smiles) Went off well... Initially, I was a bit nervous, but I gradually slipped into the role and enjoyed it...         
	Support from co-commentator         
	Harsha (Bhogle) was on with me and I found it comfortable... Hed been interviewing me over the years and Id be comfortable with him.         
	Thoughts on entering the commentators box         
	That the ground looked different from the other end... For years, Id only been looking at Trent Bridge from the pavilion side.         
	Beginning his innings in the second session         
	Id been slotted in the first (Indian) innings, but I requested a change so that I could watch the other commentators go about their job before I got started... I used the time to prepare and, of course, enjoy the Indian batting.         
	The homework done         
	Id like to bring a different perspective, dwell on what goes through a bowlers mind... What are the things a bowler looks for... Also, try and give an insight into modern-day preparations by cricketers... So, I did some homework on that.         
	Whether he was critical during his five-over stint         
	Dont think you need to be critical... Dont think youve got to pass judgement while sitting in a commentators chair... After all, having gone through everything myself, I know players can make mistakes... But, yes, you give your views... Offer your take.         
	If hed call a spade exactly that         
	Oh, yes... Its not in my nature to hold back... Ill always be myself, with the mike, not attempt to be somebody else.         
	No.1 challenge for a commentator         
	To be dispassionate and try and bring something new for the viewer.         
	Sunil Gavaskars comment that hell be bringing freshness and should speak his mind         
	Its nice of Sunny to have said that...         
	Tips from veterans         
	I did speak to Sanjay (Manjrekar) and Harsha.         
	Having once been a guest commentator in Sharjah         
	That was for half-an-hour in a match I wasnt playing... In 1995, I think... Tony Greig was my co-commentator.         
	Contract being limited to 10 days of commentary         
	Thats because Id like to see how it goes... One of the reasons for retiring from international cricket was to spend time with the family. Now, if I do this full-time, then Ill be back to travelling all the time... Id like to review things once my 10 days are over.         
	Finally, plans after returning home         
	A couple of business proposals came up just before the IPL, but I havent had the time to study them... Ill be doing so now... Then, Im looking at setting up a foundation for wildlife conservation and, perhaps, encouraging research too... Also on the cards is publishing a coffee table book of photographs taken by me... So, there are things to do.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Argentina fate on the line
                                                   Argentina fate on the line
                      
	Buenos Aires: Diego Maradona fights for his future as Argentinas World Cup coach when he sends his team out against Peru on Saturday.         
	Maradona, whose side are flirting with elimination in a playoff berth, believes his players will get the victories they need to remain on course for the 2010 finals in South Africa.         
	Failure to beat the already eliminated Peru at home would put Maradonas team in serious danger of missing the finals for the first time since 1970. They play Uruguay away in their last qualifier on October 14.         
	I didnt expect to get to a situation like this. We have to beat Peru and then win in Uruguay, Maradona told a news conference on Thursday.         
	The top four in the 10-nation South American group qualify while the team in fifth place, at present Argentina, go into a playoff against the team finishing fourth in the Concacaf region.         
	Maradona, set to make a raft of changes, is putting his faith in two players who have not previously been in Argentinas plans since the qualifying series kicked off two years ago. Benfica midfielder Pablo Aimar, who played at the 2002 World Cup, and Real Madrid striker Gonzalo Higuain look set to start in a revamped attack.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Didnt say no to captaincy 
                                                   Didnt say no to captaincy 
                      
	New Delhi: Virender Sehwag, who had recently said the Board should pick a youngster for the vice-captaincy the better to groom him for the skippers job, has denied saying no to Indian captaincy, insisting that he is open to taking up the job as and when required.         
	All I had said was that I didnt want to be vice-captain and that it should go to a younger player who can be groomed as captain. But if an opportunity arises and the team needs it, I can lead the side, he said.         
	However, Sehwag doesnt want to step into Mahendra Singh Dhonis shoes.         
	Right now, I dont think Dhoni should be replaced as captain but at some stage if he is injured and if I am offered the captaincy, I will take it, he said.         
	Sehwag picked fellow opener Gautam Gambhir, who replaced him as captain of the Delhi DareDevils team, as a future captain of the national side.         
	Gautam has the talent and I have seen and observed him from close quarters. His thinking towards the game is very positive and he has leadership skills too, he said.         
	I have led the team for two years and we reached the semi-finals.         
	I feel Gautam should be given a chance to make the team do better, as technically, the teams only have a year left with the existing three-year contract, he added.

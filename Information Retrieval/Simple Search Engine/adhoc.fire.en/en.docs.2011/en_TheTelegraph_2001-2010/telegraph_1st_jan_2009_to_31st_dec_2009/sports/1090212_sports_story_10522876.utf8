The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Son could make Woods   even better 
                                                     Son could make Woods   even better 
            Mark Reason            Tiger Woods                                 
	Tiger has proved his supernatural abilities to the world. He has very nearly proved them to himself. But Woods hasnt yet proved anything to little Charlie Axel. Do you think Tiger Woods needs more motivation? Well, he now has the biggest inspiration a professional sportsman can get. A son.         
	You may think that is all psychological mumbo jumbo, but consider for a moment some facts. The last three first-time winners of the Masters had all just become fathers of a son for the first time. Phil Mickelson won his first major in 2003 a year after the birth of Evan. Zach Johnson won in 2007, three months after the birth of Will. Trevor Immelman won in 2008, a year after the birth of Jacob.         
	There is a name for this phenomenon. It is called the nappy factor and was first identified by the betting guru Keith Elliott more than 10 years ago. To begin with it was nothing more than a hunch.         
	Then in 2000 the European Association of Labour Economists published statistics showing that fathers salaries rise nearly five per cent every time they have a child and that the premium was far greater for a son than a daughter. Im sure a son will have an amazing effect even on someone as driven as Tiger, Elliott said.         
	Woods has already said he became a better golfer since the birth of his daughter, Sam. But what effect will a son have? Padraig Harrington won in America for the first time 18 months after the birth of Patrick. Ernie Els won his first major for five years a month after the birth of his son, Ben, and then finished in the top 10 in seven of his next nine majors.         
	The way that Woods has always spoken about his own father makes you wonder if the effect could be even more dramatic. Just last month Woods was riffing in Golf Digest about pops.         
	He said: Even to this day when Im out there struggling and I dont have my best stuff Ill go back to: You know what, Daddy, Im going to put the ball right there. Right there. Im going to put that little two-iron right there, Daddy. No problem. I got it. Boom, I put it right there. (Pause in silent reverie). Thanks pops.         
	Tiger, more than any sportsman you can think of, knows the value of fatherhood. He may even take paternity leave and not return to competitive golf until next month. We dont know for sure yet. But the defending Masters champion Immelman knows what to expect when Tiger does return. He said: I think hell be better. I know him well and thats his personality.         
	And had Immelman heard the one about Tiger holing one shot in 10 from 40 yards in practice recently? The South African smiled and said: Thats his myth. The myth is about to become reality again.         
	Please welcome onto the first tee, Mr Tiger Woods, 14 times a major champion and the daddy of them all.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

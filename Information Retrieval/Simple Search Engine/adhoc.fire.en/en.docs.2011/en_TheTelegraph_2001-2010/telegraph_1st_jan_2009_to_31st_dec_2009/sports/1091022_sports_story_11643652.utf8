The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ankle injury forces Jeev to skip meet
                                                     Ankle injury forces Jeev to skip meet
                Jeev Milkha Singh                     
	New York: Ace Indian golfer Jeev Milkha Singh Wednesday withdrew from next weeks Frys.com Open to give himself more time to recover from an ankle injury.         
	Having secured his PGA Tour card for the next year, Jeev, who has had two top 10 finishes in the US this year, was looking forward to another good finish to round off his season before injuring his right ankle.         
	Jeev said the risk was not worth since he was set to play in some other big events in Asia and Europe. I was really looking forward to playing the Frys.com Open, but unfortunately, I had to pull out of the event with an injured right ankle, said Jeev.         
	It is the same injury that bothered me last year around the PGA Championship. I thought I had got over it, but thats apparently not the case, he said, promising to return next year.         
	Jeev reckoned wearing wrong shoes at the Justin Timberlakes PGA Tour event last week led to his injury since he was used to wearing special footwear. The ankle started feeling funny during Fridays second round, and by the time I started warming up for Saturdays third round, I had intense pain. I somehow finished the final two rounds with the help of painkillers, but after I arrived for Frys.com Open, I could barely walk, he said.         
	Meanwhile, in Johor Bahru, Rahil Gangjee booked a berth in next months Hong Kong Open securing a top-three finish with a five-under 67 in the international qualifying meet Wednesday.

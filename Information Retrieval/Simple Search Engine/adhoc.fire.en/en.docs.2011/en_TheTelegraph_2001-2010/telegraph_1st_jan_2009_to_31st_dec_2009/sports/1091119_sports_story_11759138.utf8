The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Manager with a difference
                                                                                                                                   Manager with a difference
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                      
	Ahmedabad: Its nothing unusual for a former Test cricketer to be the manager of the national side, but Brendon Kuruppu, who is a reputed and successful coach in Sri Lankas domestic championship, took up to the job because of his love for the game.         
	Im a qualified coach and when the opportunity came, I took it since Im ready to serve the game in any capacity Its always good to have a former player as manager because its easier for him to understand the needs and demands of the players. It helps if you are capable of handling the administration part as well, Kuruppu, who played four Tests and 54 ODIs, told The Telegraph.         
	As coach of Bloomfield Cricket Club in Colombo, Ive won premier championships for several years. Roshan Mahanama, Kumar Dharmasena and Sanath Jayasuriya have all played under my coaching, he said.         
	For the record, Kuruppu is only the third batsman to score a double century on his Test debut against a Richard Hadlee-led New Zealand attack in Colombo in 1987.         
	Given his background, does he contribute at team meetings? Weve a solid support staff led by coach Trevor Bayliss. If there is too much advice, it will only confuse the players I usually come into the picture only when it is absolutely necessary., he explained.         
	So how does he view his role in the side? Its basically a management team of which Im the head. Each member has an individual role to play, and my task is to co-ordinate with the players, and if there are any shortcomings, take corrective measures, he said.         
	Kuruppu has worked with the national team as manager in 2004 and 2005, and is now on a tour by tour contract. His experience with the national side suggests the necessity of having a fixed manager for a fixed tenure. The manager has to win the confidence of the players, and you cant win that on one tour, says Kuruppu.         
	Remember, a cricketer lives on a suitcase for at least 300 days a year So when manager changes on every tour, it doesnt help the bonding. It takes a long time to win the confidence of the players.         
	Is the Indian board listening?

	Calcutta: Overnight leader, Grandmaster Sandipan Chanda continued to sit pretty after the end of 5th round of the Kolkata Open Chess Tournament here on Saturday.         
	Playing against GM Le Quang Liem of Vietnam, Sandipan held the advantage for most part of the game and would have extended his lead to a full point but he missed a tactical shot which changed the complexion of the game. He still managed to draw the game with accurate play in the end game.         
	Despite his draw, Sandipan continues to be the sole leader with 4.5 points. A cluster of ten players  including Nigel Short  huddle together, half a point behind on 4 points.         
	I had played against Le Quang Liem twice earlier with a win and a draw against him. I had an excellent position today, but I missed a move and found myself in a tight spot trying to save the game. Sandipan told The Telegraph after his game.         
	Sandipan meets Short on the top board in a crucial 6th round encounter Sunday. I have met Short twice in Mumbai at the Commonwealth and in Gibraltar in 2006 and drawn both the times, he disclosed.         
	On the 2nd board GM Enamul Hossain of Bangladesh drew a rook end game against GM Eltaj Safarli of Azerbaijan. Second-seeded Short had to be content with a draw against sixth seed GM Evgeny Postny of Israel when all his attempts to elicit an advantage came to a naught in a minor piece ending.         
	P. Magesh Chandran of India outwitted fifth seed GM Gadir Guseinov of Azerbaijan in the Marozy bind of Sicilian defence where he held the advantage right from the opening. Magesh Chandran won a rook for bishop and then effectively utilised his passed pawn to win another rook and the game.         
	B. Adhiban, the U-16 National Challenger champion, upset GM Vadim Malakhato of Belarus to catapult himself to the joint second spot on 4 points. Adhiban won a piece for two pawns on the 39th move in a French defence and made no mistake thereafter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev Milkha rises to tied 21st position
                                                   Jeev Milkha rises to tied 21st position
                      
	South Carolina: Jeev Milkha Singh recovered from a slow start to card a two-under 69 and jump 20 places to tied 21st after the second round of the Verizon Heritage golf tournament.         
	The Indian has a total of two-under 140 after the halfway stage of the $5.7 million event at Harbour Town Golf Links. A 10th tee starter, Jeev was off to a poor start, stumbling to a bogey on the 11th hole and parred the remaining seven holes to make the turn one-over.         
	Jeevs fortunes changed for the good in the front nine as he picked up three birdies on the second, fifth and ninth holes to round off the day on a positive note.         
	Brian Gay used a run of five straight birdies to push past Todd Hamilton and take a one-stroke lead.         
	Gay, whose best season came in 2008 with his first victory and more than $2.2 million in earnings, had six birdies on his front nine on his way to a 66. He stood 9-under after two rounds at Harbour Town Golf Links.         
	Hamilton, the 2004 British Open champion, also shot a 66. He kept up his stellar play from a week ago when he tied for 15th at the Masters.         
	First-round leader Alex Cejka shot a 71 after an opening 64 and was two shots behind along with two-time US Open champion Lee Janzen.         
	Janzens round of 70 included a hole-in-one on the breezy 17th hole.         
	Green jacket winner Angel Cabrera took a break as did Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson. In all, just six of the top 20 ranked golfers teed it up here.         
	Gays streak began when he rolled in an 18-footer for birdie on the par-3 4th hole, then picked up steam with a 25-foot putt a hole later. His approach from a fairway bunker landed inside 5 feet for a third straight birdie.         
	After a birdie putt inside 10 feet on the seventh, Gay closed the stretch with another sizeable putt of 20 feet to get reach 10 under. Gay had a chance from 15 feet away on the ninth hole to keep things going, but settled for par.

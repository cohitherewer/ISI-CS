	Calcutta: The reigns of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) will once again be in Jagmohan Dalmiyas hands as he retained his post, unopposed, as the president of the state association in the 78th Annual General Meeting on Friday.         
	The ruling faction also had a landslide victory in the elections for the four vice-presidents posts, the only ones to be contested this year. Abhijit Dutta, who was the only candidate from the opposition camp, managed just 24 votes, which was 68 less than Timir Ghosh, who garnered 92  the least number of votes received by a Dalmiya-camp candidate.         
	However, the AGM was in no way a placid affair. With Sourav Ganguly, representing Mohammedan Sporting, debuting in the administrative affairs of the CAB, Fridays evening turned out to be quite an eventful one.         
	Among those present in the AGM were national selector Raja Venkat and union minister Sultan Ahmed.         
	According to sources, Dalmiya had to intervene at one point to restore sanity as the members got involved in heated altercations. The chairman went to the extent of saying that he would have to adjourn the meeting if everybody didnt calm down, said the source.         
	According to Dalmiya, this years AGM was fruitful.         
	Apart from the general agenda, cricket as a whole was discussed in a positive light in todays meeting. A lot of points concerning the betterment of Bengal cricket were raised today, he said.         
	Commenting on Sourav, Dalmiya said: I have maintained from the very beginning that he was always welcome in the CAB. I hope all the apprehensions were cleared today. I have asked him to draw a master plan for the development of the game and I will definitely fix-up a date to sit with him.         
	In fact, not only Sourav, all the former cricketers are welcome, he elaborated.         
	He also accepted the fact that former Bengal coach Utpal Chatterjees removal was not handled in an ideal manner and hinted that the CAB might write a letter of thanks to him.         
	Speaking on Souravs question on national selector Raja Venkats absence from the states selection committee, he said: When Raja Venkat became a national selector, we already had four selectors for the state. So, to include him we had to drop someone.         
	Before signing off, Dalmiya informed that he would be representing the CAB in the BCCIs working committee meeting on Sunday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni not sure of Viru for tri-series
                                                     Dhoni not sure of Viru for tri-series
            A STAFF REPORTER    
	Calcutta: Virender Sehwag, who is undergoing rehabilitation following a shoulder surgery, may be left out of the squad for the triangular series in Sri Lanka, Mahendra Singh Dhoni hinted on Thursday.         
	The national selection committee meets on Sunday to pick the squad for the tri-series  where the Indians will play hosts Sri Lanka and New Zealand  and the Team India captain could not confirm Sehwags availability.         
	Dhoni, who was in the city for a promotional, said that the right-handed India opener is regaining fitness with every passing day and is shaping up well for the Champions Trophy in South Africa from September 22.         
	He (Sehwag) is improving everyday. He is putting in a lot of effort to get ready for the Champions Trophy, Dhoni said.         
	Asked whether Sehwag would be available for the tri-series, Dhoni said:  Whether Sehwag will be available for the Sri Lanka tour, its too soon right now just a few days to go.         
	Sehwag, who plays for the Delhi DareDevils, injured his shoulder during the second edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in South Africa.         
	Incidentally, fast bowler Zaheer Khan has already been ruled out of action for the rest of the year. Zaheer, who underwent a shoulder surgery last month, also injured himself during the IPL in April.         
	Though the left-arm pacer played the World Twenty20 Cup in England, he clearly struggled with his injured shoulder. It was learnt that Zaheer has been advised a minimum rest of three months by Dr Mark Ferguson, who has successfully treated Sachin Tendulkar in the past.         
	Talking about the teams fitness, Dhoni however, rubbished any other injury problem.         
	We just had a mid-term fitness test and well have a camp before the triangular series to get back into the groove. We are trying to get ready for the long season ahead, Dhoni stated.

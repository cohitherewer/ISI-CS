The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | McEnroe offer for Federer
                                                   McEnroe offer for Federer
                      
	Paris: John McEnroe has offered to help Roger Federer rediscover his form after the Swiss suffered a series of uncharacteristic defeats this year.         
	Since the start of the season, Federer has failed to win a tournament or beat any of his rivals ranked in the worlds top four.         
	After his latest loss to Serbias Novak Djokovic on Friday, McEnroe said he was willing to lend a helping hand.         
	I would really like to help Roger. Especially as he needs to change his strategy if he wants to beat Nadal.         
	And I have an idea about that, the American was quoted as saying in a French weekly on Saturday.         
	I cant see myself accompanying a player all year long but it could be really interesting to help out from time to time.         
	Federer has failed to beat his greatest rival Rafael Nadal for almost 18 months and has emerged second best in their last five meetings, including five-set final thrillers at last Julys Wimbledon and at the Australian Open in February.         
	McEnroe said the Spaniard could cause Federer, who is one shy of Pete Samprass all time Grand Slam title record of 14, even more problems in the future.         
	I think (Federer) will beat Samprass record of 14 Grand Slam wins. But it will not be easy at all for him to become world No. 1 again, McEnroe, a former world No. 1 himself, said.

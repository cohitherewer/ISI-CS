The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India take 5-0 lead
                                                   India take 5-0 lead
                      
	Surrey: Shivendra Singh scored twice as India defeated Canada 3-1 to extend their lead to 5-0 in the seven-match hockey Test series at Tamanawis Park here Friday.         
	Shivendra found the net in the 20th and 65th minutes of the match, while in between Sarwanjit Singh scored in the 54th minute to help Indias cause.         
	Gabbar Singh pulled one back for the Canada, converting a penalty stroke in the 47th minute.         
	The visitors have already taken an unassailable 5-0 lead in the series with one match drawn and will sign off their tour with the seventh and last Test here Saturday.         
	The Indians could have registered the victory by a bigger margin had they not missed as many as six penalty corners and an equal number of open field chances.         
	Canada, on the other hand, were denied any short corner because of an alert and agile Indian defence, which made clean clearances from their danger zone.         
	 India went into the offensive as early as in the opening minute of the match, winning a penalty corner when striker Gurvinder Chandi struck the foot of Wayne Fernandes but the pullout could not be stopped.         
	Short after, two more scoring chances went abegging as Roshan Minz and Danish Mujtaba failed to beat Canada goalkeeper Matt Peck.         
	The Indian midfield consisting of Gurbaj Singh, Sardar Singh and Raghunath constantly created space for the forwards but Canadian defenders Fernandes, Adam Froese and Scott Sandison put up a resolute resistance of the visitors.         
	India, however, took the lead in the 20th minute when Shivendra struck home from captain Sandeep Singhs slapshot. The visitors won two more penalty corners in the opening session but failed to find the net on both the occasion.

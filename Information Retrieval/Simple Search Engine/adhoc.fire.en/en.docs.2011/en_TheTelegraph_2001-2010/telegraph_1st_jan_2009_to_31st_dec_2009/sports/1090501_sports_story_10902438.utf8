                  Dirk Nannes (right) celebrates with Amit Mishra after dismissing Adam Gilchrist in Pretoria on Thursday                     
	Centurion: Virender Sehwag, captain of the Delhi DareDevils, said that he was happy with his teams effort against the rampaging Deccan Chargers, on Thursday. The DareDevils won the match by six wickets.         
	I think I am pretty happy with the performance. The pitch was good to bat on and we did a good job. Its hard to defend on this ground. Thats why I chose to bowl first, he said.         
	Sehwag played down a finger injury, which he picked up during the match. Its okay, just a few stitches. I will be fine for the next game, he said.         
	Sehwag also lavished praise on Man of the Match Dirk Nannes, who picked up two wickets for 16 runs.         
	He is the fastest bowler I have played against. He is a very difficult left-armer to face, he said.         
	Nannes, on his part, said that he had been worried about his place in the side after failing to make any major contribution in the previous matches.         
	I was actually a bit worried about myself and was looking over my shoulder because I had not taken too many wickets. Im just happy with my performance today (Thursday).         
	I am not trying too much and I was pretty happy to get Gillys wicket, he said.         
	The Deccan Chargers captain Adam Gilchrist said that he was prepared for an end to the teams winning spree.         
	I have played for Australia in World Cups where we have won matches on the trot. It had to happen and it has happened today and thats the reality, Gilchrist said.         
	We didnt post enough on the board. Kept fighting till the end but didnt have enough runs, he added.         
	Gilchrist said the loss of early wickets put his side on the back foot and they could never really recover from that.         
	 Losing wickets early on puts the team on the back foot. They did well to restrict us. We were 20 runs short. What we managed was definitely not enough, he said.           (PTI)

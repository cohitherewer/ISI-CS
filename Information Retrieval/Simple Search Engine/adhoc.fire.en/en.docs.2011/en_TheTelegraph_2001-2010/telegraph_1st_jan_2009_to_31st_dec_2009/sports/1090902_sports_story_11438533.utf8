The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Things looking up now: Sania
                                                   Things looking up now: Sania
                      
	New York: Somdev Dev Varman and Sania Mirza posted first round victories on the opening day of the US Open to become the first man and woman from India to reach the second round of the same Grand Slam event.         
	Sania defeated Olga Govortsova of Belarus 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, and qualifier Somdev beat Portugals Frederico Gil 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 (as reported in Mondays late City edition).         
	For a long time... I was the only one (from India) playing singles in the main draw of the Grand Slams, said 22-year-old Sania, playing in her fourth US Open. Its great that Somdev is playing so well since the beginning of the year and getting better.         
	Im really happy that we have two Indians in the second round of a Slam. I dont know if its ever happened before.         
	In 1998, Leander Paes and Nirupama Sanjeev were in their respective main draws of the Australian Open as wildcards, and Paes went on to lose in straight sets to Mikael Tillstrom of Sweden.         
	Sania said it has been a wonderful few days for Indian sport as the milestone in New York followed the success of the Force India Formula One team, whose Giancarlo Fisichella secured pole for last weekends Belgian Grand Prix before finishing second in the race.         
	Its great, she said. Things are looking up. They have been for a while now, but I guess theyre looking further up.         
	Somdev said the scoreline might show a straight sets victory but he had to toil hard for it. I really dug in there, didnt get tight. I competed well. Thats what gets you through those tough ones  the way you compete, he said.         
	Somdev played a solid service game in the contest, which lasted more than two hours, breaking his rival seven times. I dont want to jinx myself but I feel good about where I am. Ive had a couple of quality wins. It gives me a lot of confidence and belief that I can come out and compete with anyone. My game is up there with the rest, he said.         
	According to Sania, the mere act of competing at Flushing Meadows was an achievement after a 2008 season in which she was sidelined by a career- threatening wrist injury.         
	Physically I think Ive never been fitter, in terms of how I move around the court and hitting the ball but Im a little rusty, said Sania.         
	Sania said being sidelined for so long made her appreciate what she had taken for granted. One day youre on the court, you feel, Oh, Im the fittest person, Im an athlete. And the next day... I could not even pick up a fork to eat, it was so painful.         
	Sania, who reached the fourth round of the Open in 2005, said she had been playing some Challenger tournaments, winning one and reaching the final of another before returning home for more treatment on her wrist.         
	I know I have the weapons and I know I can do it. Now I play a seed, and really, I have no pressure, she said about her second round match against 10th seed Flavia Pennetta of Italy.                 (AGENCIES)

	Pretoria: Rohit Sharma scored a breezy 38 and then followed it up with four wickets, that included a hattrick to guide the Deccan Chargers to a convincing 19-run victory over the Mumbai Indians in their Indian Premier League match here Wednesday.         
	Sharma shone with both bat and ball, making a crucial 38 off 36 deliveries and then scalping four. Sharma gave away six runs in his two overs to bring the Hyderabad outfits campaign back on track after three successive defeats.         
	With this victory, the Chargers have moved to second on the table with nine points.         
	Chasing a modest 146, JP Duminy fought a lone battle and made a fighting 52 off 48 balls but that was not enough to see his side home as the Mumbai Indians could manage only 126 for eight wickets in their 20 overs.         
	Earlier Sharma struck a sensible 38, while Venugopal Rao chipped in with with a quickfire 28 to guide the Chargers to a modest 145 for six.         
	The Mumbai Indians were dealt two early blows by the Chargers left-arm pacer R.P. Singh (2/19), who claimed the crucial wickets of Sanath Jaysuriya and Sachin Tendulkar in his first over.         
	Jayasuriya was the first to depart, brilliantly caught at third man by Ryan Harris. If that was not enough, RP removed Tendulkar with his next ball, a delivery that came in after pitching, to see the Mumbai outfit struggling at seven for two.         
	But South African batting sensation Duminy and wicket-keeper batsman Pinal Shah were in no mood to be bogged down by the early dismissals as the duo launched a belligerent counter attack to take their side out of trouble.         
	Duminy was the initiator with two fours of RPs second over and then Shah sent Dwayne Smith twice over the fence to take the Mumbai Indians score to 50 for two after seven overs.         
	But Shahs 19-ball 29-run cameo was finally ended by off-spinner T. Suman (2/14) when he was caught by Smith at long-on, thereby ending his 42-ball 53-run fourth wicket stand with Duminy.         
	From there on, Duminy took up the responsibility and played cautiously with occasional hits to the fence.         
	The left-hander stitched another run-a-ball 37-run partnership with Dwayne Bravo (13) to bring the Mumbai Indians closer to victory.         
	But some insensible batting from the Mumbai Indians and Sharmas sensational two-over spell turned the game in the Chargers favour.         
	Needing 49 off 36 balls, Bravo went for a big hit off Suman only to find Harris, who took a well judged catch.         
	Then came Sharma, who single-handedly changed the fate of the match with his first hattrick to seal the match.         
	Sharma clean bowled Abhishek Nayar and Harbhajan Singh on the last two balls of the 16th over and then completed his hattrick, picking up the prized wicket of Duminy, caught by Adam Gilchrist off the first ball of the 18th over. Sharma added another to his tally when Saurabh Tiwary was stumped by Gilchrist.

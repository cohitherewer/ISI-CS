The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev Milkha drops to tied 35th 
                                                     Jeev Milkha drops to tied 35th

	Ponte Vedra Beach (US): Jeev Milkha Singh turned in a roller-coaster two-over 74 to slip to the tied 35th spot after the second round of The Players Championship golf tournament here.         
	The Indian has a total of two-under 142 after the halfway stage of the $9.5m event.         
	A birdie on the second hole gave him a perfect start but it all went downhill thereafter as Jeev stumbled to four bogeys in the space of five holes. He picked up a birdie on the ninth but that hardly made a difference as Jeev made the turn two-over.         
	The back-nine was equally wobbly as Jeev shot in a couple of birdies against an equal number of bogeys to complete a rather disappointing day.         
	Daniel Chopra, meanwhile, improved by a massive 10 shots from his first round 75 to bolt into tied 22nd place with a total of seven-under 140. Germanys Alex Cejka fired a five-under-par 67 to lead by two shots from Britains Ian Poulter.         
	World No. 1 Tiger Woods was seven shots off the lead after producing a three-under 69.         
	The 38-year-old Cejka posted 13 birdies in his two rounds and is halfway toward the tournament record of 26 set by Fuzzy Zoeller in 1994.         
	Cejka has yet to win on the PGA Tour but was in contention at the Players four years ago when he was one stroke off the lead with four holes to go before fading to finish 12th.         
	Poulters four-under 68, to follow his 67 from the first round, leaves him in a strong position for the weekend, two strokes clear of six players four shots off the lead.         
	Swede Henrik Stenson and US Masters champion Angel Cabrera (65) were among those sharing third place. Argentine Cabrera, who started the tournament with a triple-bogey seven at his first hole on the way to a 72, hit nine birdies and two bogeys. Woods, still far from his best after his eight month lay-off following a knee operation, was again inconsistent with three bogeys among his six birdies.         
	I just kind of plodded my way along today. I mWorld No. 2 Phil Mickelson shot 71 for 144  level par  to just avoid the cut.           (AGENCIES)

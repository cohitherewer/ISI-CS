	The Indian Cricket League (ICL) is set to hold a meeting on May 16 to decide on its players request to relieve them of their contracts and be allowed to go back to the BCCI fold.         
	A lot of cricketers have expressed their desire to snap ties with ICL and they will need to get a no objection certificate from the ICL authorities.         
	We have still one more year left in our contracts with the ICL, so we need to get an NOC from them.         
	 The ICL is holding a meeting on May 16 to decide on our request.         
	Things will become clear a day after that, Stuart Binny, who used to play for Karnataka until he joined the ICL two years ago, told The Telegraph on Saturday.         
	Bengals Subhamoy Das and Avishek Jhunjhunwala have already expressed their desire to return to the BCCI fold and a few others are expected to join them.         
	Seven Bengal cricketers had joined the ICL.         
	Binny and others said they had no regrets about joining the rebel league.         
	The quality of cricket was good, no doubt about that. It is just that the last few months they had been having problems on the financial front and the 26/11 attacks have made it worse, Hemang Badani of Tamil Nadu said.

                                                   Ponting gets CA support
                      
	Melbourne: Cricket Australia (CA) Monday threw its weight behind captain Ricky Ponting and the national selection panel while at the same time promising to review the humiliating away Ashes loss.         
	The 1-2 series loss also saw Australia lose their No.1 status in Test rankings and drop to fourth, one spot above England and opinion polls in Australian dailies showed that a majority wants Ponting sacked.         
	Rickys had a very, very good series. Hes been under incredible pressure. I thought the dignity and poise that he showed in defeat was something that all Australians should be very proud of, CA chief executive James Sutherland said.         
	Australian selectors, headed by chairman Andrew Hilditch, have also drawn flak for leaving spinner Nathan Hauritz out of the team for the final Test. I dont think we can hold the selectors accountable in any way (for the loss). At the end of the day the players go out and do the business on the field, he said.         
	It was only a few months ago that we had a fantastic series in South Africa and the selectors were hailed for their job and in some way the perceived risks that they took in backing young talent. It would be jumping to conclusions too quickly to blame the selectors, Sutherland said.         
	The (CA) Board is comfortable with the role theyve (the selectors) played over time. In the cold hard light of day well review the series and get a better understanding of what went right and wrong, he added.         
	Sutherland was of the view that lack of experience in the team, after the retirements of Glenn McGrath, Shane Warne, Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden, was among the reasons.         
	I dont think were under any illusions as to where this teams at, were definitely in a rebuilding phase after losing some of the best players to ever play cricket for Australia.         
	What you get with a young and relatively inexperienced team is some ebbs and flows in performance.         
	With CA planning to make at least one of the three-man selection panel full-time, Sutherland said there would be no increased role for the captain and coach in selection matters.

	Kingstown: Mahmudullah completed a memorable Test debut as he cruelly exposed the West Indies frailties to bowl Bangladesh to a historic 95-run victory in the opening Test here Monday, as reported in Tuesdays Late City edition.         
	The 23-year-old off-spinner captured five wickets for 51 runs from 15 overs, as the hosts, chasing 277 for victory, were dismissed for 181 in their second innings about 20 minutes before the scheduled close on the fifth and final day at the Arnos Vale Sports Complex.         
	Shakib-al Hasan formalised Bangladeshs second Test victory ever, when he trapped Tino Best leg before for nine with a dipping full toss, and ended with three wickets for 39 runs from 28.1 overs.         
	The result means that Bangladesh lead the two-Test series 1-0 with the final match set to start on Friday at Grenadas Queens Park Stadium Complex.         
	Bangladeshs victory which came about four and a half years after their solitary Test win against Zimbabwe on home soil in Chittagong was made more remarkable because their new captain and primary fast bowler Mashrafe Mortaza spent the entire Windies innings off the field nursing a knee injury aggravated earlier in the match.         
	I feel much better now following this victory, said Mortaza. Special thanks to Shakib for deputising for me, and the way he handled the side.         
	It was probably a blessing in disguise when we got bowled out (on Monday morning) which gave us more time. We were looking to bat until lunch and get a lead of about 300 or more, but we lost our last five wickets quickly.

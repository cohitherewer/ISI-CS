      Dont expose stumps while sweeping      Roll your fingers across the seam to bowl cutters                                                              
	I am a righthander and cannot play inswinging deliveries. As a result I always get bowled or am dismissed leg before. Please help.              
	(Samrat Das, 14, Calcutta-14)              
	Work on your footwork. You are anchored to the crease. Its important you go forward or back according to the length of the delivery.              
	I am a right-arm mediumpacer. How does one bowl the off and leg cutters?              
	(Ayan Mukherjee, 16, Calcutta-40)              
	Its a case of rolling your fingers across the seam.              
	What is the difference between sweep and paddle sweep?              
	(Ankit Pattnaik, 17, Rourkela)              
	Paddle sweep is played where you use the pace of the bowler in getting the ball fine. A proper sweep is where you come down on the ball a lot harder to get it away square.              
	I am a righthanded batsman and always get out to a yorker. Please help.              
	(Rohit Sanyal, 17, Calcutta-42)              
	Watch the ball and check your backlift.              
	I am a leg-spinner. Whenever I try bowling a faster delivery, I end up bowling wide or full toss. Why does this happen?              
	(Samit Dutta, 21, Calcutta)              
	Keep watching the spot you want the ball to land and ensure the head doesnt fall away.              
	I often get bowled when attempting the sweep against a leg-spinner?              
	(Ramen Dhar, 19, Jamshedpur)              
	Make sure you dont go too far across with your front foot hence exposing the stumps when attempting to play the shot.              
	I often misjudge balls that are to be left outside the off-stump. What rule should I follow for judging such balls?              
	(Lalit Verma, 17, Bardhaman)              
	Check your guard. And when you move your feet either forward or back you got to know where your off stump is.              
	How can I improve concentration while batting?              
	(Prabal Sardar, 21, Calcutta)              
	Playing to your strengths. Being selective in your shot making and talking to yourself all the time. These things will help.              
	I am a righthanded batsman. I often get bowled by the pace. Please help.              
	(Roktim Dhar, 20, Calcutta)              
	Watch the ball. Check your back lift and move early so that you have extra time to adjust.              
	How can one be strong in the mind? Is it inborn?              
	(Sudipto Mohanty, 19, Calcutta-68)              
	It comes with confidence and a lot a self-belief in ones own ability. It only improves with success and experience.

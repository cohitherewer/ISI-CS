The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Schumi return unlikely
                                                                                                                       7                                      Schumi return unlikely
                      
	Frankfurt: A Formula One comeback by seven-time champion Michael Schumacher is highly unlikely, the German drivers spokesman said Friday.         
	An article Friday in a London daily speculated the 40-year-old could be tempted to come out of retirement to drive for Mercedes GP, the new team formed by Mercedes-Benz after it bought a majority stake in Brawn GP, last seasons F1 champion team.         
	You can never say never in this sport, but to me, (a comeback) is highly unlikely at the moment, Schumachers spokeswoman Sabine Kehm said.         
	Schumacher, who retired in 2006, called off a temporary comeback earlier this year for Ferrari because of a persistent neck injury.           (AP)

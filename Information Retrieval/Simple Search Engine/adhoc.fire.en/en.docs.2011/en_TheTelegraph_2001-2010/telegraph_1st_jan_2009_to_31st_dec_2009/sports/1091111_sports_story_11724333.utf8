                                                                                                                                     Ricky: Wish to finish on a winning note too
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Ricky Ponting in Mumbai on Tuesday                           
	Mumbai: Australia captain Ricky Ponting on Tuesday said his team had a superior bowling attack compared to that of India and that proved to be crucial for the visitors in the seven-match series.         
	Ponting also said at a press conference on the eve of the final one-day International that his team would like to finish the series on a positive note. Australia, who lead 4-2, have already pocketed the series.               
	The following are excerpts               
	His thoughts on the inconsequential match         
	We want to finish the tour on a very positive note. As far I can see 5-2 looks better than 4-3. The series has been decided but not over as far as we are concerned. We are obviously going full steam ahead to try and win the game.         
	On clinching the series with a young team         
	It says all about the individual players. Its tough to get picked for Australia and then get a game So, whenever the opportunity comes around, the guys want to grab it with both hands. I said before the start of the tour that if all the 11 players contribute each time we play, then we knew we would be very hard to beat.         
	Bouncing back after the Ashes loss         
	Over the last month, we had some great highlights. If we look at the Champions Trophy it was a terrific win for us and probably we had a few injuries going into that. That led many people to think that we could not win over here. We showed them we are still a capable side.         
	His leadership         
	People may consider whatever about my leadership. I always feel I always give the best I can do and lead the side in the best possible way. I think there is always a different opinion about me as a player and captain. All the players have responded very, very well. Our cricket in general is set in the right direction. We will obviously be ranked No. 1 (ODI team) in the world. And we want to get our Test ranking back again as well.         
	The success of youngsters in this team         
	It is a great sign. All of a sudden we had inexperience in our team. There were negatives arising out of injuries, but at the same time, it also created positives. It is positive to get younger guys and give them exposure at the international level. We felt a lot of guys have got the experience now.

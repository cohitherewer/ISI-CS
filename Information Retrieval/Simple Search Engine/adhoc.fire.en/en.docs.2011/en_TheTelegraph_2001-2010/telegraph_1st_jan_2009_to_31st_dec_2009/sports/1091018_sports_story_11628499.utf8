	New Delhi: Andhra Pradesh weightlifter Seepana Yamini became the latest dope offender as she failed a National Anti-Doping Agency (Nada) test conducted in August.    
	Yamini (58 kg), who was in the original 30-member Indian squad for the Commonwealth Senior and Junior Weightlifting Championships to be held in Penang, Malaysia, from October 19 to 23, failed the NADA out-of-competition test in Bangalore.     
	She is the seventh dope offender in the past few days which added to the discomfiture of the Indian Weightlifting Federation which is facing the prospect of being banned upto two years besides a fine of at least $50,000.        
	Vilamoura: Shiv Kapur slumped to tied 46th with a two-under 70 but a final hole bogey sent Jyoti Randhawa crashing out from the Portugal Masters golf tournament here.

	Fifa plan  
	Zurich: Fifa is preparing to reintroduce a ban on playing international football matches at high altitude, which is likely to spark off a fresh dispute with South American countries. Fifa said last year that teams must acclimatise for two weeks before playing at ab-ove 3,000 metres. Bolivia threatened legal action because they play in La Paz at 3,640 meters (11,900 feet).       
	Cairo: Ghana beat Brazil in a penalty shootout to become the first African team to win the under-20 World Cup on Friday. The final finished 0-0 after extra time at the Cairo International Stadium, and Ghanas Emmanuel Agyemang-Badu scored the winning penalty to make it 4-3 after Brazils Maicon missed a chance to win it at 3-2.        
	Calcutta: Australia continued their domination of the Indoor Cricket World Cup, with both the mens and womens sides claiming hard-fought wins in their respective grand finals in Brisbane on Saturday.

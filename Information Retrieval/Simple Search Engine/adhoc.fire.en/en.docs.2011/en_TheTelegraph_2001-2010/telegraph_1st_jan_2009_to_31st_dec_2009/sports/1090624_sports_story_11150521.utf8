                                                   Players leave for camp
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A temporary solution to the impasse, over the release of players by Mohun Bagan and East Bengal for the national camp, was found Tuesday with mediation by the Indian Football Association (IFA) secretary Utpal Ganguli. Following the meeting the two clubs allowed their players to report for the camp.         
	For its part, the AIFF, in an act of good faith, replied with a letter assuring the clubs that it would convene a meeting by July 10 to discuss the issues raised by them.         
	They have also agreed to bear the medical expenses in case of an injury to a player during practice with the national team.         
	The national body also said that they would do whatever was necessary to see that the players and the clubs are not inconvenienced in any way.

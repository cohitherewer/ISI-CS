The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Will start from scratch: Dhoni
                                                                                                                                   Will start from scratch: Dhoni
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Guwahati: Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was his usual positive self Saturday morning.         
	But he, too, admitted at the media conference that the Hyderabad loss was disappointing and still hurt the players. However, the team has moved on and Sunday will be a new day.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On Sundays pressure game         
	Every game is a pressure game. We have two games in hand and need to stay fresh mentally and look at what lies ahead. Our priority is to stay in the series. We are not looking too far ahead. One has to cope with pressure as an international player.         
	The mood in the team after Hyderabad         
	It did hurt and was disappointing. Such things happen But we have left behind everything in the dressing room. And that is what is important. We cant do much about it. What counts is not to make the same mistakes and concentrate on the next match. It is a fresh start. We need to do everything right from now on When we turned on the field today I told them we dont have to keep in mind what happened. We need to do what we have to do well because it is a fresh start. We will start from scratch. The mood is positive. We are doing well as a team. The dressing room atmosphere is good.         
	On what went wrong there         
	We should have calculated a little better. We had five overs of power play and five wickets. We are learning and hope not to make the same mistakes again.         
	Strategy for Sunday         
	Get off to a good start and dictate terms to the opposition. Not to go into the match with any fixed score in mind. You can always reschedule if you dont lose wicket. You can keep or change the target, depending on the type of partnership we have in the middle.         
	The pitch         
	Its appears to be a classic Indian pitch.         
	On the middle-orders performance         
	It is not a worry for us. We rely on good start and when our openers dont score now and then theres pressure on the middle order. If we get good starts, it is ideal for No. 4 Yuvraj Singh to come and play his shots. This is a series where our middle-order has not been consistent. We have done well in patches. Weve got to improve.         
	Virender Sehwag not turning up for practice         
	It was a light session for us. We wanted to give the guys rest. That is why we had a long warmup session. Sehwag did not turn up because practice was optional. That is why Harbhajan Singh got some batting practice.         
	On persisting with Ravindra Jadeja         
	We are not supposed to speak on selection issues. Those doing well deserve a chance. Jadeja is improving. He is bowling well and by the end of series will also deliver with the bat.         
	Role of seniors in the team         
	They are constantly in touch with the youngsters.

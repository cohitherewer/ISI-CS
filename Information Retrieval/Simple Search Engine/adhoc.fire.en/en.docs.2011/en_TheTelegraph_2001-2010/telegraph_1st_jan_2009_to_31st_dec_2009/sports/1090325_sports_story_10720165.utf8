The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kim set for comeback
                                                     Kim set for comeback
                  Kim Clijsters with the US Open trophy in 2005                     
	Brussels: Former world No.1 Kim Clijsters will hold a news conference Thursday amid reports she is planning a full-time return to tennis.         
	The 25-year-old Belgian, who retired two years ago, will unveil her plans for 2009 at the tennis centre where she has been training recently. Recent photos have showed Clijsters looking close to competition fitness.         
	A local newspaper said she was set to enter top-level tournaments again. There have also been reports saying she is targeting the US Open, which she won in 2005 for her only Grand Slam title.         
	A spokeswoman for Clijsters did not return repeated phone calls. Even though she no longer has a WTA ranking, Clijsters could quickly be reintegrated by awarding her wild cards for any tournament she wants to enter.         
	Clijsters retired from the WTA Tour in May 2007. She married basketball player Brian Lynch and gave birth to a daughter, Jada, in February 2008. Fellow Belgian star Justine Henin retired last year while she was still ranked No. 1.         
	In her last competitive match two years ago, Clijsters lost in the Antwerp Diamond Games final to Frances Amelie Mauresmo before a capacity 14,500 crowd at the citys Sport Palace.         
	Clijsters has already announced she would play several exhibition and lower-level matches.         
	She is scheduled to play Steffi Graf on May 17 as part of a series of exhibition matches at the Wimbledon to test the conditions under the new retractable roof over Centre Court.         
	She is also scheduled to play a June 14 exhibition match at the Ordina Open in Rosmalen against Michaella Krajicek, as well as two matches for the St. Louis Aces in the World Team Tennis league during the summer.         
	Apart from winning the US Open, Clijsters reached four Grand Slam finals and won 34 singles titles overall. She won two Grand Slam doubles titles and held the No. 1 ranking for 19 weeks.         
	Womens tennis has seen a successful mother in Lindsay Davenport turn a champion. It would be interesting to see if Clijsters can emulate the American.         
	The glamorous world of womens tennis has also seen quite a few teenagers make it big and then fizzle out. Jennifer Capriati and Martina Hingis of the USA and Russian Anna Kournikova are three famous names in that category.         
	There have been regular incidents of early retirements in recent years.           (AP)

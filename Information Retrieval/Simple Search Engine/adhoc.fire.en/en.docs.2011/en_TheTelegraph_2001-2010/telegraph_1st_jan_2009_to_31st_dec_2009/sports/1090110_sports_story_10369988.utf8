The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saina loses in quarters 
                                                   Saina loses in quarters 
                      
	Kuala Lumpur: Ace Indian shuttler Saina Nehwal played her heart out but eventually ran out of steam as French Hongyan Pi beat her in a gruelling quarter final encounter of the Malaysian Super Series here Friday.         
	The world No. 10 Indian went down 17-21, 26-24, 16-21 to Pi, whom she had beaten in the World Super Series last month, after a nerve-wracking 56-minute battle.         
	World No. 8 Pi made her intentions clear right from the start and opened a 9-6 lead before stretching it to 15-9. But Saina soon narrowed the gap to 13-15 claiming four straight points. However, the Indian could not keep up the pace and the first game slipped out of her hands 17-21.

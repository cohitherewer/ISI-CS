The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Askarel may strike again
                                                                                                               Askarel may strike again 
            STAR RACER                                    
	Calcutta: Jockey C. Alford is out to boost his winning tally on Thursday, the penultimate fixture in the truncated winter season. With just two meetings to go, Alford is already sitting pretty at the championship table with an unassailable 30-point lead over Neeraj Rawal.           
	The trainers championship, too, is in the safe-keeping of Vijay Singh who, with a score of 42, leads over Daniel David by 21 points. In fact, the contest in this department is going to be for the second slot between Daniel and Harvinder Singh Bath who are separated by barely two points.          
	The afternoons eight-event card, however, appears to be a tricky one but Vijays ward Askarel, in the 1,400m Executive Force Cup, may carry his top weight to another victory. The horse is already a winner of two easy races this season and Alford may be trusted to steer the Local Talent son to another victory.

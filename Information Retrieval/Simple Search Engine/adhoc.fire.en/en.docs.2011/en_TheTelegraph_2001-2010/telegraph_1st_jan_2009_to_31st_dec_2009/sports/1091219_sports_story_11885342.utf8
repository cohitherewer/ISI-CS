The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods has Phelps sympathy 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Woods has Phelps sympathy 
                  Michael Phelps                     
	Manchester: Michael Phelps expressed sympathy for Tiger Woods and his family on Thursday because of the scrutiny they are under after the golfers infidelities came to light.         
	Speaking ahead of the Duel in the Pool swim meet, Phelps said that he wished Woods and his family well.         
	Hes going through a hard time right now I assume  Ive no idea what he is going through  but it cant be easy, I just wish him the best for himself and his family, Phelps said at the Manchester Aquatics Centre. Id be the first to admit Ive made a lot of mistakes both in and out of the pool.         
	Phelps, who won a record eight Olympic gold medals in Beijing, was photographed with his mouth to a marijuana pipe last year.         
	The mistakes Ive made, Ive never repeated. Ive become a much stronger person and Ive helped other people not make the same mistakes.         
	Phelps was in the running for the Athlete of the Decade award, but finished fourth behind Woods, Lance Armstrong and Roger Federer.         
	Woods, who is taking an indefinite leave from golf, has not spoken publicly since crashing his SUV outside his home three weeks ago. Since then, several women have said that they have had affairs with the world No.1 golfer.         
	After the photograph of Phelps was published in a British tabloid, USA Swimming suspended him for three months.         
	Phelps has definitely learnt his lesson, as Woods surely has now.         
	Although he rebounded in July and won five golds and a silver at the world championships in Rome, Phelps lost his reputation, his aura and, possibly, tens of millions of dollars in earnings from sponsors after the damaging photos were published.         
	Kelloggs, which had put Phelpss beaming smile on its cereal packets, was the first to throw him over the side. Michaels most recent behaviour is not consistent with the image of Kellogg, the company had tersely said after not renewing his $1million contract.         
	Woods knows how that feels. Swiss watch maker Tag Heuer said it would be considering its relationship with Woods while technology outsourcing and consulting firm Accenture has said it was ending its six-year sponsorship deal with Woods.         
	Shaving products maker Gillette, too, has pulled away but did not sever ties completely.         
	Experts had said that the pressure had got to Americas Olympics hero.         
	The negative publicity generated by Phelpss moment of madness  photographers parked themselves outside the swimmers home, shouting through megaphones to get his attention  led him to tell his local newspaper that the thought of quitting had entered his mind for the first time.         
	What I have gone through in the past week, no one wants to go through. If I decide to walk away, I will decide to walk away on my own terms, Phelps had said.         
	Phelps is in Manchester to lead an American team against the best swimmers from Britain, Italy and Germany. I absolutely hate to lose and I know that I can swim a lot faster than I swam at the World Cup, Phelps said.

                                                     Dont tinker with ODI format
                  Bob Simpson                     
	Mumbai: Former Australia captain and World Cup-winning coach Bob Simpson feels there is no need to tamper with the structure of one-day cricket which has come under scanner due to the growing popularity of Twenty20 format.         
	The mantra of the former Test opener to rejuvenate the 50-over game is to make the teams strive for wickets and win matches, make pitches livelier as well as lengthen the boundaries as was the case when one-day cricket began.         
	Simpson, on a brief stop-over with his wife in Mumbai which was one of the 45 ports his cruise was touching, was responding to champion batsman Sachin Tendulkars suggestion to split the ODIs into four innings of 25 overs each.         
	I dont think we have to fiddle too much with it. We need to get the players and the administrators believe that you win matches by bowling teams out, he said in a brief chat at the Cricket Club of India before rejoining his cruise.         
	Simpson, one of the finest slip fielders and the first foreign coaching consultant of the Indian team during the 1999 World Cup, said the tactics being adopted in 50-over game by teams has become boring.         
	When one-day cricket was introduced, everybody said this will save the game. The public has got tired of one-day cricket because tactics were boring. It just got to a stage where there was so much over emphasis on batting and so-called all-rounders that the overall standard of bowling dropped dramatically, he said.         
	The 62-Test veteran, pointing out to the declining standard of bowling attacks, emphasised that to make a game interesting for the crowds not only runs need to be scored, but wickets, too, should tumble regularly.         
	There are not many good bowling attacks now. You need wickets to be falling and runs to be scored. They have also shortened the boundary, which immensely helps the batsmen, said the former player who revived Australian cricket and guided it to the 1987 World Cup crown in the Indian sub-continent as coach.         
	Simpson, who used to conduct cricket clinics at the CCI for many years when late Raj Singh Dungarpur headed the club, recalled the role played by ODIs in developing the Australian Test side when he was its coach.         
	When I was the Australia coach, we used one-day cricket to develop the Test side. What we always strove was for results. A lot of matches, 90 per cent I think, were won by one team bowling the other out, he said.         
	Simpson indicated he was not a big fan of Twenty20 format which, he felt, was another form of the ODIs and said his worry was that the players would start to develop skills from T20 and go on to play Tests and not the other way.         
	The worrying aspect is if we go so mad on Twenty20, everyone learns cricket via Twenty20. I dont think they will have the technique and the mental capacity to play all forms of the game, he said.         
	Presently most of the players have come through Test, one-day and Twenty20 (in that order) and have developed the skills for all forms. But there is a major problem (in our hands) if we go the other way, he said.

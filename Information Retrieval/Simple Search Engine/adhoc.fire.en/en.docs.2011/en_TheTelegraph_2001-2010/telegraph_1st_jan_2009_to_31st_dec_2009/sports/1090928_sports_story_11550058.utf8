The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India slide to No.3
                                                   India slide to No.3
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Johannesburg: The ranking roulette in the ICC ODI chart continued with Indias 54-run defeat to Pakistan that saw Mahendra Singh Dhonis men, who went into Saturdays match ranked No.1 in the world, slip to No.3 behind Australia, and South Africa.         
	After Sundays update, Ricky Ponting amp; Co. are on 125 ratings points, the same as Graeme Smiths South Africa, but the Australians take the top spot on the virtue of having accumulated more points.         
	India have 124, and depending on the result of Mondays all-important clash against Australia, there might be further changes in the top three.         
	Sitting off the top three, but across a sizeable gap are Pakistan, with 113 ratings points.         
	Rarely has so little separated the top three teams ever since the rankings were introduced in 2002 and, delicious as the Champions Trophy spread looks, the battle royale for the top spot has served to open an intriguing sub-plot.         
	Because even if none among the top three manage to win the Trophy, the No.1 spot, at least, can secure bragging rights to the team that ends No.1 after the tourney in South Africa.         
	In the ongoing assault at the summit, India first became No.1 on September 11, when they registered a 46-run victory over New Zealand in the tri-series in Sri Lanka.         
	But that joy was short-lived as within 24 hours, Dhoni amp; Co. had slumped to a 139-run defeat to Lanka to slide to No.3. The Proteas became No.1 then and the Aussies were in the second position. Triumph in the tri-series final meant India regained the No.2 spot.         
	With any reversal certain to cause a slide, the Dhonis have the added incentive of bolstering their claim to the top spot when they take on the Aussies Monday.         
	Teams         
	1. Australia 125; 2. South Africa 125; 3. India 124; 4. Pakistan 113; 5. England 107; 6. Sri Lanka 106; 7. New Zealand 106; 8. West Indies 76; 9. Bangladesh 55; 10. Zimbabwe 26; 11. Ireland 25; 12. Kenya.

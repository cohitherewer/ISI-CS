The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sri Lanka run over Bangla
                                                   Sri Lanka run over Bangla
                      
	Chittagong: Sri Lanka crushed Bangladesh by 465 runs in the second Test on Tuesday, recording the fifth highest run margin to sweep the series 2-0.         
	Tillekeratne Dilshan emerged the unlikely bowling hero to rout Bangladesh for 158 after tea on the fourth day after helping Sri Lanka set an improbable victory target of 624.         
	Dilshan, 32, also followed his first innings 162 with 143 to become the fourth Sri Lankan to score a century in both innings as the visitors declared on 447 for six at lunch. He also grabbed four for 10 as Sri Lanka wrapped up their biggest victory in terms of runs.

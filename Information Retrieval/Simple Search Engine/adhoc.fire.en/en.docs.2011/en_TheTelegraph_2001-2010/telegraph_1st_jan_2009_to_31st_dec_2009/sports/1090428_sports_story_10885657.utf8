                                                   Giggs wins PFA award
                      
	London: Manchester Uniteds Ryan Giggs was voted Player of the Year for the first time by the Professional Footballers Association (PFA) on Sunday.         
	Despite making only 12 Premier League starts and scoring a single goal, the evergreen Welshman finally took the prize after 18 years as a professional with United and just short of 800 appearances for the club.         
	He edged out United teammates Cristiano Ronaldo, Nemanja Vidic, Edwin van der Sar and Rio Ferdinand as well as Liverpools Steven Gerrard.         
	Its right up there with personal accolades  its the best to have as its voted by your fellow players, Giggs was quoted as saying on the BBC. Ive been fortunate to win a lot of trophies, I won the young player award twice, but this is the big one.         
	Its an exciting season. I think it is going to go right to the wire, theres big game after big game now. That is what you want and need at a club like Manchester United.

                                                     Knight Riders rope in Parmar, Rana
            A STAFF REPORTER              Mohnish Parmar                      
	Calcutta: Kolkata Knight Riders added Gujarat off-spinner Mohnish Parmar and Haryana bowling allrounder Sachin Rana to their squad for the second edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	The 20-year-old Parmars name had been doing the rounds for quite some time while Ranas signing was confirmed by Knight Riders officials at the end of their three-day training-cum-selection camp on Wednesday.         
	Parmar has been quite a revelation for the Gujarat Ranji Trophy team. The off-spinner has been a match winner this season, scalping 34 wickets at a meagre 18.05.         
	Rana bowls medium pace and is learnt to be quite handy with the bat.         
	The franchise has quite a few players on their radar and the list of signings will be finalised after a teleconference between captain Sourav Ganguly, advisor-in-chief John Buchanan and the other coaches, Joy Bhattacharya, chief executive officer of the franchise said.         
	However, according to sources, Nataraj Behera, Rajesh Verma, Sunny Singh, Shoaib Sheikh and Shatrunjay Gaekwad have impressed the spotters.         
	Sourav missed the final days camp owing to his fathers illness.         
	The selected players will reassemble in February for a skill-enhancement camp.         
	On the final day of the camp at the Eden, the players were put under match situation to see how they respond. The batsmen were given mock targets and the bowlers were asked to defend them.         
	It is learnt that if Australia eventually play Pakistan in April for the five ODIs and a Twenty20 match, it might be a cause of concern for the Knight Riders.         
	The city-based franchise has Australians Ricky Ponting and David Hussey in their ranks.         
	Both players are likely to make the cut for their national squad and will, in that case, be ruled out for the IPL.         
	According to sources, the franchise has 35-year old Australian Brad Hodge in their sights for the second season. Of late, the Australian has not featured in the national squad and therefore will be available if Australia go ahead with their Pakistan tour.         
	Meanwhile, former CEO of Baroda Cricket Association Makrand Waingankar has been appointed head of Kolkata Knight Riders newly-formed Talent Research Development Wing (TRDW) which will help spot talent across the country.

                                                   ICC: No neutral venues for Cup
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has ruled out shifting Pakistans share of the 2011 World Cup matches to a neutral venue, reaffirming that the games taken away from the troubled nation on security grounds will be held in the other three co-host countries.         
	At the board meeting in London, the ICC refused to give back Pakistan its share of 14 matches, besides ruling out the possibility of involving any other country.         
	One learns there was considerable arm twisting by the BCCI to ensure that Pakistan did not get back its matches and Sri Lanka and Bangladesh fell in line. Some of the other boards also supported the BCCI.         
	The ICC World Cup 2011 Central Organising Committee has been asked to meet as soon as possible and recommend to the ICC board, venues within the other three host countries for the 14 matches originally set for Pakistan, the ICC said in a statement.         
	ICC president David Morgan said the neutral venue option, floated by the Pakistan Cricket Board itself, was discussed at the meeting but was eventually ruled out.         
	A fifth country? The board considered that but it has decided the 14 matches originally allocated to Pakistan should take place in the three other Indian subcontinent countries of the full members, Morgan said.         
	We need a recommendation from those four host nations, including Pakistan. They will come forward with the location of those matches to the commercial board of the ICC, he added.         
	The ICCs commercial board also reiterated that Lahore would no longer be the World Cup administrative headquarters, which has been shifted to Mumbai.         
	Meanwhile, the PCB accepted the ICC boards offer of a task team to help ensure Pakistan retains its position in international cricket. No country is willing to tour the strife-torn nation.         
	In another decision, the ICC has shifted the under-19 World Cup from Kenya to New Zealand after the African nation was found to be underprepared for hosting the event in February.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India face a tough task
                                                   India face a tough task
                      
	Gros Islet: A jittery India go into the crucial third ODI against the West Indies here on Friday with the form of their top-order batsmen being a worrying factor.         
	Barring a couple of individual performances, the Indians have generally been a pale shadow of themselves in the first two matches of the four-match series and Mahendra Singh Dhonis team have a daunting task to put it across the hosts.         
	With the series locked 1-1, both the teams will go all out for a victory to ensure that they cannot lose the series.         
	While the visitors snatched a narrow 20-run victory in the first game at the Sabina Park in Kingston, they suffered an embarrassing eight-wicket drubbing in the second match which will no doubt serve as a morale-booster for the Caribbean team.         
	The huge defeat will act as a wake-up call for Dhonis bravehearts who had a string of victories to their credit till only a couple of months back. Suddenly, the team find itself under tremendous pressure.         
	In the absence of Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, the top order has lacked the firepower and the poor form of Gautam Gambhir has only compounded Indias misery.         
	Wicketkeeper-batsman Dinesh Karthik has been tried out as Gambhirs opening partner in this series with mixed results. The failure of Rohit Sharma has been a cause of concern for the Indians.         
	The Indian bowling has also lacked the sting and much will depend on Harbhajan Singh to stem the Caribbean run flow. The pacers will also have to bowl in the right areas to be able to put pressure on the West Indian batsmen.         
	While the emphatic win in the last match will certainly boost their confidence, the home team also have to plug a few loopholes if they hope to take a 2-1 lead in the series.         
	West Indies captain Chris Gayle was happy with the way his wards responded in the last game in Kingston but is also aware that a lot of work still remained to be done.         
	Match starts: 7 pm (IST)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arsenal just hitting top gear: Wenger
                                                   Arsenal just hitting top gear: Wenger
                      
	Madrid: Arsene Wenger has all but conceded any possibility of the Premier League title but still believes the team have a realistic chance of silverware in the Champions League and FA Cup.         
	As a rejuvenated Arsenal headed for Villarreal and Tuesdays Champions League quarter final first leg, Wenger was in buoyant mood following Saturdays demolition of Manchester City.         
	You cannot win the championship if you lose five of your first 14 games, he said after Arsenals 2-0 victory.         
	But the team is young and we have come through it, and we are not the same team now as we were in August and September. Theres a lightness back in the team, we are playing without the handbrake and we go into this Champions League game in a good state of mind, very focused, full of belief and commitment. I still believe this season can be a very successful one for us.         
	Arsenals win consolidated fourth place in the race for next seasons Champions League spots, but as important as the three points was the return from long-term injuries of midfielder Cesc Fabregas and striker Emmanuel Adebayor.         
	Fabregas, back in the side for the first time since December after recovering from a knee injury, ran the match in midfield and made both goals for Adebayor, returning after 10 games out with a hamstring injury.         
	Villarreal are still reeling from their miserable 3-0 league defeat at Almeria on Saturday, that was made all the worse by the injury to winger Santi Cazorla.         
	A fractured shin bone has put the Spain international out for the rest of the season.           (REUTERS)

    - Italian leaves Force India for Ferrari; Liuzzi tipped to fill vacant spot           A STAFF REPORTER            Giancarlo Fisichella                                 
	Calcutta: Giancarlo Fisichella is finally joining Ferrari. After days of denial, Force India Thursday announced that the Italian driver is moving to the Italian Formula One team with immediate effect, insisting that no financial considerations were involved.         
	Force India chairman and team principal, Vijay Mallya said that following extensive discussions over the past 24 hours, the outfit agreed to release Fisichella from his contract with immediate effect to join Ferrari for the remainder of the 2009 season.         
	Fisichella, 36, had been the overwhelming favourite to replace the hapless Luca Badoer, Ferraris veteran test driver, who has struggled badly in his two races last month since being brought in as the injured Felipe Massaa replacement.         
	Giancarlo and his management team approached me yesterday (Wednesday) with a proposal from Ferrari. For any Italian driver, a Ferrari race seat is a long-held dream and it was no different for Giancarlo. No one should stand in his way, Mallya said in a release.         
	Furthermore, the agreement will secure Giancarlos long-term future with Ferrari and it would be incorrect to jeopardise this, particularly when Giancarlo has made such a vital contribution to Force India, he said.         
	He said the team would soon name Fisichellas replacement. Force India test driver Vitantonio Liuzzi is tipped to fill the vacant slot.         
	Since Fisichellas second-placed finish in the Belgian Grand Prix, the Formula One paddock was abuzz with reports of his move to Ferrari but both the driver and Mallya himself had denied the reports, dismissing them as mere speculation and rumours.         
	Ferrari were enthusiastic about Fisichellas move. We have chosen Fisichella because we can expect him to make a valuable contribution in this final part of the season, Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicali said.         
	Fisichella, on his part, said he just couldnt believe it. Im in seventh heaven, he was quoted as saying on the Ferrari website.         
	I still cant believe that the dream of my life has come true and I want to thank Ferrari and chairman Luca di Montezemolo. Over the last week some really incredible things have happened to me: the pole position and then the second place at Spa and now Im called by Ferrari to race the last five races of the season for them.         
	Ill give my best to recompense Ferrari for this great opportunity I know it wont be easy, but Ill give it my everything to gain the best possible results. I want to say that Im very sorry for Luca I know how much he cared to race in Monza behind the wheel of a Ferrari, because this is the best thing that can happen to an Italian driver, to drive a red car in front of our fans, Fisichella said.         
	There were also reports that Force India owed money to Ferrari for using their engine last season and the Fisichella move would wipe out the debt, but Mallya insisted no financial consideration was involved.         
	We would like to stress that we have not accepted any financial settlement from Ferrari. This agreement has been made in good faith and for the good of Giancarlo and the sport in general. A competitive Italian driver in a Ferrari for Monza is a positive story for Formula One, which can only help raise the sports profile in these difficult times, Mallya said.         
	We would like to thank Giancarlo for all his help over the past one-and-a half seasons and for delivering us our first World Championship points last weekend. He has been an integral part of the team and we owe him a great deal for his input behind the scenes and performance out on the track. We wish him all the best for the future, he added.         
	Mallya also dismissed suggestions that Fisichellas exit would weaken the outfit, which tasted its first Formula One points in Belgium courtesy Fisichellas second place finish.         
	For Force India, this sport is a team effort and removing one part, even a major one, will not significantly affect our performance. The competitiveness of the team in Belgium was a result of hard work in the factory and wind tunnel and we have further developments lined up for the final races, so we are confident this momentum can be sustained. We are now looking forward to a strong finish to the season, he said.

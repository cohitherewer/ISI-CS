The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Another defeat for India
                                                   Another defeat for India
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	The Indian spinners restricted South Africa to a paltry total on a Trent Bridge track that had lot on offer for the tweakers in their last Super Eight match on Tuesday.                     
	South Africa defeated India by 12 runs to maintain an all-win record in the ICC World T20. Set a target of 131, the defending champions could manage only 118 for the loss of eight wickets. In the semi-finals, Pakistan play South Africa in Nottingham on Thursday while Sri Lanka take on the West Indies at the Oval the following day                     
	South Africa huffed and puffed to reach 130 for five after they won the toss and chose to bat. India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni used as many as eight bowlers, including five spinners, as Harbhajan Singh and Indias other part-time spinners got plenty off spin and bounce from the Trent Bridge track.         
	It was AB de Villierss quality 63 from 51 balls that gave the South Africa innings a semblance of respectability.         
	De Villiers, who walked in at No. 3, got off to a brilliant start after Herschelle Gibbss early dismissal. He played the Indian pacers with lot of authority and drove and cut with elan. But he was forced to consolidate and look for singles as the spinners came on. Dhoni introduced spin, in the form of Ravindra Jadeja, in the sixth over. The Proteas were going well with 44 for one on the board but the run-rate completely nose-dived from there on.         
	So complete was the domination of the Indian spinners that the pacers got only six overs to bowl out of 20  the first five and the last over of the innings.         
	Dhoni rotated Jadeja, Rohit Sharma, Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan and Suresh Raina one after the other and none of the spinners disappointed him. For eight overs during the middle of the innings, the South Africans didnt manage to hit a single boundary.         
	De Villiers, who hit seven boundaries during his knock, had to be content with ones and twos against the spinners till he broke free with two consecutive boundaries off Yuvraj.         
	Jadeja was the most economical with his left-arm spin as he gave away nine runs off three overs picking up the prized scalp of De Villiers. The South African came down the track, was beaten in flight, and went for a slog sweep. The ball went up straight in the air and the bowler accepted it gleefully.         
	Harbhajan also bowled well and extracted vicious turn off the pitch. He picked up South African captain Graeme Smith and bowled his four overs for 20.         
	Gibbs (5), who opened the innings with Smith in the absence of Jacques Kallis, didnt last long. He hit his Deccan Chargers teammate RP Singh for an exquisite cover drive. But on the very next ball, Gibbs played the left-arm pacer onto his stumps, trying a pull off one that was not short enough.         
	Graeme Smith (26) made a useful contribution with his run-a-ball knock. He combined for a 46-run partnership with De Villiers for the second wicket.         
	But the South Africa captain looked more comfortable against the pacers during his stay. He played some delightful cuts and drives against the pacers including his trademark on-drive. But once spin was introduced, Smith started struggling.         
	He tried to make room for himself and play shots but failed to do so against some intelligent spin bowling by the Indians.         
	His ordeal ended once he tried a slog sweep against Harbhajans off-spin. The shrewd off-spinner beat him in the air and the southpaw holed out at mid-wicket where Jadeja kept a cool head to take a skier.         
	JP Duminy (10) and Mark Boucher (11) both failed to up the tempo in the face of Indias disciplined bowling performance.         
	Duminy looked shaky from the start against the spinners and failed to rotate strike. He was out stumped as he went down the wicket to Raina. The ball spun across the face of the bat and Dhoni made no mistake behind the stumps.         
	Zaheer sent back Boucher in an 11-run final over. The South Africa wicketkeeper hit it hard and straight but RP ran across from long-off to take a well-judged catch just off the ropes.

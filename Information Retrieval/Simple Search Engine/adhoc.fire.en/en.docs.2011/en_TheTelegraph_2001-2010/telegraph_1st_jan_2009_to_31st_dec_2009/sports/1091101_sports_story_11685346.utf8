	Ludhiana/ Mumbai: Mahindra United were forced to split points with JCT after their I-League match ended in a goalless draw at Guru Nanak Stadium here Saturday.         
	Now Mahindra have 10 points from six matches, while JCT nine from as many outings.         
	Meanwhile, Churchill Brothers take on Air India in an I-League match at the Cooperage, here on Sunday. The defending champions have only one win and four draw after five matches.         
	The prime reason for the teams floundering start has been up front. Prolific scorer Okolie Odafe has been closely marked by the rival defenders and Churchill just do not have the Plan B.         
	The 24-year-old Nigerian has scored just two goals so far in the I-League.

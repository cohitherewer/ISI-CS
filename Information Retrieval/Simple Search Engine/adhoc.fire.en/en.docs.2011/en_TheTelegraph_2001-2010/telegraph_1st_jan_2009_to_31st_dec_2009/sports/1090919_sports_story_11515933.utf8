The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spain lead 2-0
                                                   Spain lead 2-0
                      
	Murcia: Juan Carlos Ferrero and David Ferrer gave champions Spain a 2-0 lead over Israel with crushing singles victories on the opening day of their Davis Cup World Group semi-final on Friday.         
	Roared on by the boisterous home support in Murcia, former world No. 1 Ferrero thumped Dudi Sela 6-4, 6-2, 6-0 after Ferrer had earlier thrashed Harel Levy 6-1, 6-4, 6-3.         
	Israel are through to the last four for the first time but must now win Saturdays doubles and the two reverse singles on Sunday if they are to upset the home side on their favoured clay surface.         
	In Rome, world No. 1 Roger Federer cruised to a 6-3, 6-4, 6-1 win over Simone Bolelli on Friday to help Switzerland take a 2-0 lead in their Davis Cup World Group playoff against Italy in Genoa.         
	Federer said he felt tired before the match after flying back to Europe following his five-set defeat by Argentine Juan Martin Del Potro in Mondays US Open final but it rarely showed.         
	He surrendered a break advantage in the fourth game of the second set with a couple of poor forehands but he regained it in the next game and went on to wrap up the match with ease.         
	Earlier his teammate Stanislas Wawrinka pulled off a 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 win over Andreas Seppi, who took a break at the start of the third set because of stomach cramps.

	London: Abhinav Bindras joy knew no bounds after becoming the first baton-bearer of the Queens Baton Relay for next years Commonwealth Games in New Delhi.         
	Bindra, Indias only individual Olympic gold medallist, took the baton from organising committee chairman Suresh Kalmadi to mark the beginning of the 340-day relay journey from Buckingham Palace here Thursday. President Pratibha Patil, who was present, made history by becoming the first Head of a state to attend such a ceremony.         
	It is a matter of great honour to be the first runner in the historic relay. It is a dream come true. I have participated in three Olympics and it is a great honour to be part of the Delhi Commonwealth Ga-mes, Bindra said.         
	Bindra handed over the baton to legendary middle-distance runner Lord Sebastian Coe, who said: It is a fabulous opportunity to showcase Delhi.         
	Indias only cricket World Cup winning captain Kapil Dev took the baton from Coe and was happy to be part of the traditional ceremony.         
	It is fantastic to represent the country, he said.         
	Sania Mirza was all smiles at the ceremony. I am happy to be one of the few chosen for the Baton Relay. I am looking forward to represent India at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi, she said.         
	Milka Singh, 1958 Commonwealth 400m gold medal winner, popularly known as the Flying Sikh thanked the Indian organisers for inviting him to the ceremony.         
	I am grateful for the invitation. At the age of 80 nobody bothers about you, he said.         
	The Baton also passed through the hands of Vijender Singh, Sushil Kumar and Englands first Sikh cricketer Monty Panesar.         
	The torch, which will cover about two lakh kilometers across the world in its 340-day journey through air, sea and land, will remain connected with the headquarters through a GPRS system and a camera. Built with aluminium and gold, it has Queen Elizabeths message engraved on a miniature 18-carat gold leaf.         
	The Baton will enter India through the Wagah border along Pakistan, 100 days before the start of the Games.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Thilan scores a double century
                                                   Thilan scores a double century
                      
	Lahore: Thilan Samaraweera scored his second double hundred in a row and Tillekeratne Dilshan stroked a fluent century as Sri Lanka amassed 606 on the second day of the second Test against Pakistan.         
	Pakistan were 110 for one in reply at the close on Monday with Salman Butt run out in the final over of the day for 48. Fellow opener Khurrum Manzoor is unbeaten on 59. Samaraweera scored a majestic 214 and Dilshan 145, overshadowing career-best Test figures of six for 135 by Umar Gul.         
	Samaraweera, who scored 231 in the drawn first Test in Karachi, batted for almost seven hours, facing 338 balls and hitting 32 fours.         
	Samaraweera said a result was still possible in the Test if the pace bowlers bowled in the right areas. Samaraweeras long innings ended in a run out when he called for a sharp single to cover from where Shoaib Malik relayed the ball to the wicketkeeper via Danish Kaneria with both batsmen stranded in the middle.

                                                     Title for Liem
            BIPIN SHENOY                Le Quang Liem, winner of the Kolkata International Grandmaster chess tournament, flanked by runner-up Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (left) and second runner-up   Anton Filippov at Gorky Sadan on Thursday. A Telegraph picture        Calcutta: GM Le Quang Liem, needing only a draw for the title, got what he wanted in his final round game against IM S. Satyapragyan as he signed truce in 21 moves to come out on top in the 4th Peerless Kolkata International Grandmaster chess tournament, at Alekhine Chess Club, Gorky Sadan, on Thursday. 
    The Vietnamese finished the tournament on 8 points, half-a-point ahead of Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, who was second on 7.5 points. 
  The soft-spoken Liem goes home richer by Rs 3 lakh. 
    ldquo;Frankly, I was not expecting to win something as big as this... it was only after the 7th round that I felt I had a shot at the title, rdquo; Liem said. ldquo;After my win against Anton Filippov in the 9th round, I was sure I could make it. rdquo;
    The 18-year-old Liem has just completed high school and is studying for a bachelor rsquo;s degree in economics. Liem rsquo;s best result prior to this was gold in the world U-14 boys rsquo; championship in 2005.
    Top seed Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan once again showed his fighting prowess to outplay defending champion Viktor Laznikov of Czech Republic. Mamedyarov, for his efforts, got a cash award of Rs 2 lakh.
    Uzbekistan rsquo;s Filippov beat GM Ni Hua of China to take his tally to 7.5 but was placed 3rd on fewer tie-breaking points. He received the third prize of Rs 1.25 lakh. City-based GMs Sandipan Chanda and Surya Sekhar Ganguly decided to play safe and agreed to a quick draw in 21 moves to finish on 7 points each.
    Sandipan had to be content with a fourth finish and the Rs 75,000 prize that came with it while Surya was placed 8th.
    ldquo;My game against Filippov (in the 8th) was the turn-off point for me. I had a clear advantage against him. The advantage was so much that it gave rise to a false sense of security. By the time I realised I could lose it was too late, rdquo; he rued. English GM Nigel Short finished the tournament in style, taking out Georgian GM Mikheil Mchedlishvili in characteristic fashion, with sacrifices, in a mere 26 moves in a Caro- Kann defence.
  Three GM norms were made in the meet mdash; by R.R. Laxman, S. Satyapragyan and Sahaj Grover mdash; with Laxman achieving his 3rd and final norm to become India rsquo;s 20th GM.
  Abhishek Das, Anwesh Upadhyay, B.S. Shivananda, Shyam Nikhil, Akshat Khamparia, Ankit Rajpara, Vidit Santosh Gujrathi, Sayantan Das, Nisha Mohota and Shiven Khosla all made their IM norms here.  Top board results

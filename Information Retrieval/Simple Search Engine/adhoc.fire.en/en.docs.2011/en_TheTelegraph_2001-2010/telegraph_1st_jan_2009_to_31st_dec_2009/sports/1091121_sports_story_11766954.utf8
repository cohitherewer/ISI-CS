The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 1 point better than nothing, says Tiwary
                                                                                                                       7                                      1 point better than nothing, says Tiwary
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Manoj Tiwary believes it is the captains responsibility to put his hand up and be counted when the team is down in the dumps. Although entrusted with a temporary job, the 24-year-old made sure he gave his hundred per cent both as a leader and as a batsman. After his 78 in the first innings, Bengals premier batsman scored a match-saving half-century in the second.         
	No captain is happy with one point. But if you ask me, a point is always better than losing outright. We now have to go for an outright win against Saurashtra. Its our home match and we cant afford to give our opponents any room, Tiwary said from Mysore.         
	As to his own batting, Tiwary seemed quite satisfied. When I go out to bat, I try to get the captaincy part out of my system. Also, I enjoy batting in pressure situations, whether its a Ranji Trophy final against Mumbai (he scored 94) or playing to save a match. I knew that I needed to stay there till the very end.         
	The other significant contributor, Deep Dasgupta, said that the pitch had eased out considerably.         
	I should have got a hundred as there was not much in the pitch, Dasgupta said.         
	Dasgupta will be meeting CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya to discuss his unwillingness to take further part in the season, once the team returns on Saturday.         
	Banerjees ankle pain is still there and he looks doubtful for Bengals next match.

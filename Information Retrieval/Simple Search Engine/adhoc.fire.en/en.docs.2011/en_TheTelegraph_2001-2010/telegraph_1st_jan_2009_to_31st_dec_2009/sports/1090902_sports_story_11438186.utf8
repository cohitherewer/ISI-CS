The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bond raring to have a go
                                                     Bond raring to have a go
                  Shane Bond                     
	Colombo: New Zealands pace spearhead Shane Bond is set to make a comeback to official cricket after two years when he plays in a Twenty20 International against Sri Lanka here Wednesday.         
	Bond, 34, regarded as the best New Zealand fast bowler since Richard Hadlee, was delighted that he would be playing again for his country after snapping links with the unauthorised Indian Cricket League (ICL).         
	Its been a long time coming and its something I never thought would happen again, he said. It feels like I am starting all over again.         
	Bond, who last played for New Zealand in November 2007, hoped he could meet the expectations from teammates and fans alike on his highly anticipated return.         
	I think I set myself pretty high standards and it is up to me to meet those, he said. I always strive to be the best bowler in the world, nothings changed there.         
	Bonds fiery pace fetched him 79 wickets in 17 Tests, 125 from 67 one-day Internationals and 12 in nine Twenty20 matches till he was banished for his ICL connections.         
	He was not picked for the preceding Test series which Sri Lanka swept 2-0 and warmed up instead by playing for the New Zealand A team in India last month.         
	The Black Caps captain Daniel Vettori warned against expecting the premier fast bowler to deliver immediate results. I can see the pressure building from a distance, said Vettori. People are viewing him as a sort of saviour to some recent woes, but I think we need to let Shane relax and build his way back into the team.         
	Vettori was confident his team would perform better in the two Twenty20 Internationals on Wednesday and Friday, and the limited overs tri-series (also featuring India) from September 8.         
	I think the guys have a real belief in their own ability in the shorter forms of the game, he said. I hope we will see a turnaround in our performances.           (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Usain Bolt leads team to victory
                                                     Usain Bolt leads team to victory
                  Usain Bolt                     
	London: Usain Bolt and his club teammates ran the fourth-fastest 400-metre relay time in history  37.46 seconds  at the London Grand Prix meeting Saturday, shrugging off a developing doping probe involving Jamaican sprinters.         
	Bolt anchored the team that included fellow Jamaicans Yohan Blake and Mario Forsythe, plus Antiguas Daniel Bailey, representing the Kingston-based Racers Track Club.         
	It was a good race, a good team effort, the triple Olympic champion and world record-holder said. We executed it well.         
	Earlier on Friday, Bolt had easily won the 100m, running 9.91 into a strong headwind.         
	At the end of a two-day meet overshadowed by speculation surrounding the Jamaican doping investigation, even the relay triumph had a dramatic twist.         
	The Racers TC team was initially disqualified because the 19-year-old Blake broke too quickly at the start of the second leg. However, the judges changed their minds and the quartet was reinstated within 30 minutes.         
	On Friday, Jamaicas new anti-doping organisation that four male sprinters and one female tested positive for an unidentified drug at their national championships last month.         
	I dont know what is happening back home, said Bolt, who is not involved in the probe. All I know is that we have to wait for the results of the second tests.         
	None of Jamaicas Olympic medallists from Beijing are implicated.         
	However, the countrys anti-doping officials said all five were chosen in Jamaicas team for the world championships being held August 15-23 in Berlin. The woman was identified Saturday as Sheri-Ann Brooks.         
	Blake, who ran a personal best 9.93 to finish third behind Bolt in Paris last week, declined to answer questions about the probe Saturday.         
	Earlier Saturday, defending world champion Tyson Gay won the 200m after easing up to finish in 20 seconds flat, though he required pain killers to numb a groin injury and went straight to the treatment room.         
	Gay still remained confident of defending his 100m and 200m world titles against Bolt in Berlin next month, although he is taking it one day at a time.         
	My groin has been tight on me, Im trying to take a little Advil to run through the pain, Gay said. Right now Im running on faith and thats more dangerous than anything. I dont feel anything when I hear the gun. I just run and Im dangerous. Its after that I feel it.         
	Bolt set world records in the 100m and 200m at Beijing while also being part of the Jamaican team that set a world mark of 37.10 in the 400m relay. A year earlier at the 2007 worlds in Osaka, Japan, Gay swept those events.

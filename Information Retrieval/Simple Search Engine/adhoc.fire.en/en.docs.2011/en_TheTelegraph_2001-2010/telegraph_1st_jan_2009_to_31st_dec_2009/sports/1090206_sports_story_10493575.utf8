                                                   Crowd at it again
                      
	Colombo: The fourth one-dayer between India and Sri Lanka was suspended for about 27 minutes after a stone was hurled at Pragyan Ojha during the Sri Lankan innings on Thursday.         
	It happened when 17.2 overs were bowled and the hosts were 108 for 2.         
	Ojha was fielding at the deep fine-leg region when a small stone was thrown at him, prompting Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni to take his team out of the field.         
	Dhoni spoke to both the umpires  Sri Lankas Kumar Dharamsena and B.G. Gerlin of South Africa  before taking his players off the field.         
	The Indian skipper was later seen talking with match referee Chris Board near the boundary line who then had a word with the two umpires and officials of the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC).         
	Play resumed after extra police officials were deputed in the troubled area.

                                                                                                               Diabolical has last laugh 
            STAR RACER                                
	Calcutta: Diabolical outwitted the southern invader, Arabian Knight, and the rest in the field vying for the prestigious Queen Elizabeth II Cup, over an exhaustive 2,800m trip. In the process, the prized horse also paid compliment to his mentor,           
	trainer Daniel David, who nursed him to the peak form from a training setback suffered soon after winning the Indian Derby, two winters ago.          
	The 1,600m Calcutta Million was also a close affair between the Sound Of Cheers and Credit Squeeze, the winner.

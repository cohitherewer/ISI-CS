                                                   Strauss, Flintoff rise in rankings
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Andrew Strauss, who led England to their first Ashes victory at Lords in 75 years, has gained seven places to return to the top 20 at No.14, in the ICC rankings for Test batsmen released Tuesday.         
	At 14th too, on the Test bowlers table, was Andrew Flintoff who gains four places following his Man of the Match performance at Lords.         
	As England savours an historic win, Strauss too celebrates a personal milestone. The second Ashes Test, in which Strauss hit his 18th century, saw the left-hander pass the 5,000-run mark.         
	Strausss teammate Kevin Pietersen slipped out of the top 10 allowing South Africas Jacques Kallis to re-enter the top 10. Michael Clarkes heroic stand in the second innings has been rewarded with a two-place jump and the Aussie vice-captain is at No.6 after overtaking Ricky Ponting.         
	In the Caribbean, stand-in captain Shakib Al Hasans bowling performance in the second Test versus the West Indies has pushed him into the top five of the rankings for Test all-rounders.         
	The rankings for batsmen are still led by Gautam Gambhir, followed by Younis Khan in second and Sri Lankas Kumar Sangakkara in third.         
	Among the bowlers, West Indies young seamer, Kemar Roach gained 20 places to 47th after his efforts in Grenada. The 21-year-old took six for 42 in the first innings.

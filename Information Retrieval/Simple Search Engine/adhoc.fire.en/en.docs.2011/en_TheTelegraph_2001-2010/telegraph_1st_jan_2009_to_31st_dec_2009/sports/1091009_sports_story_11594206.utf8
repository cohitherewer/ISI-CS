The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lajong stun Clube 1-0
                                                   Lajong stun Clube 1-0
                      
	Margao: Lajong FC surprised Sporting Clube de Goa with a 1-0 win to register their first victory in the I-League here on Thursday.         
	Lajong scored the all important goal in the 16th minute through Boithang Hoakip from a free kick at the Tilak Ground in Vasco.         
	The visitors now have three points from a win and defeat, while Sporting, whose opening match against Air-India was washed out, were yet to open their account.         
	The hosts got off to a good start as they controlled the proceedings for a major part of the match but failed to cash on the opportunities that came their way. They had an chance to surge ahead in the sixth minute but Anthony DSouza squandered it.         
	Anthony was in the thick of the action again but this time he failed to guide the ball on target from inside the box.         
	It was a disappointing loss. We need to learn from this, Sporting Clube de Goa coach Roy Barreto said.         
	Lajong coach Stanley Rozario said: We played according to a plan. The first match was disappointing but I am happy that we bounced back.         
	In Pune, Air India defeated Pune FC 1-0. Ravinder Singh scored the match-winner in the 11th minute. (Agencies)

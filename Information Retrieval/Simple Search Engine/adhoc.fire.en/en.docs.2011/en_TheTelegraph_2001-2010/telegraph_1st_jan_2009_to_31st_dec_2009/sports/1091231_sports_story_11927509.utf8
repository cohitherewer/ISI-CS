The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pitch was unfit: Harbhajan
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pitch was unfit: Harbhajan
                      
	Jalandhar: Endorsing his India team-mate Gautam Gambhirs view that the Kotla pitch was not suitable for international matches, off-spinner Harbhajan Singh Wednesday said practice games should have been held on the wicket before the one-dayer against Sri Lanka.         
	Harbhajan said there was something wrong with the Kotla wicket and it could have been dangerous for even Indian players if the home side had batted first.         
	The pitch was behaving in a surprising manner and the Sri Lankan players got injuries due to the fault of the pitch. The decision to call off the game was right, Harbhajan, who was here to witness a cricket tournament in the name of his father Sardev Singh at Burlton Park Stadium, said.         
	It is always better to hold some practice matches on any new pitch, instead of directly going for international matches, he said.         
	Harbhajan said the youngsters in the Indian team have performed well whenever they got chances and that will serve India well in the 2011 World Cup.         
	The newcomers have performed well. By the time of the World Cup they will attain experience as well and ultimately prove to be an asset for the team, he said.         
	Asked about his desire of becoming the vice-captain of the Indian team, given that he is one of the senior-most players in the side, Harbhajan said he was ready to accept any responsibility.         
	Harbhajan said he wanted to contribute with the bat but has been lacking in consistency. For establishing myself as an all-rounder, consistency in batting is needed, which is lacking in me. But I will try my best to improve by batting also, he said.         
	On the bowlers giving away too runs in the just-concluded ODI series against Sri Lanka, Harbhajan said on batting pitches, batsmen would score quick runs even in Test matches.         
	Even in Test matches in Ahmedabad and Kanpur, almost 2000 runs were scored during the whole match and there was nothing much for bowlers to do in such conditions.         
	Harbhajan is now one of the two most experienced bowlers for India in one-day Internationals. He has been the leading spinner in one-dayers for a long time now.         
	The Punjab spinner has taken 233 wickets in 206 ODIs, with a best of five for 31 runs.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania is out of doubles
                                                   Sania is out of doubles
                      
	Dubai: Sania Mirzas campaign in the $2 million Dubai Open came to an end when she and her Italian partner Mara Santangelo lost 3-6, 3-6 to top-seeded pair of Cara Black of Zimbabwe and Liezel Huber of the US in the second round on Wednesday.         
	Sanias singles campaign ended on Tuesday after she lost her second round match to Kaia Kanepi of Estonia.         
	The Indo-Italian duo had advanced to the doubles pre-quarter finals after getting a walkover from Polands Urszula Radwanska and Stefanie Voegele of Switzerland in the first round.         
	An injury to Radwanska forced the Polish-Swiss pair to give away the match to their opponents.         
	Seven-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams breezed into the singles quarter finals with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Frenchwoman Alize Cornet on Wednesday.         
	No. 16 seed Kanepi beat No. 3 seed Jelena Jankovic of Serbia 6-2, 7-5 while Virginie Razzano of France followed up her win over second-seed Dinara Safina by beating Slovak Daniela Hantuchova 6-2, 1-6, 6-2. Holder Elena Dementieva of Russia put out Spains Anabel Medina Garrigues 6-1, 6-3.         
	Sixth seed Williams was always in control against Cornet and was especially dominant early in the second set, surrendering just two points in four games from 1-1.         
	Eighth-seeded Serb Ana Ivanovic put out Frenchwoman Camille Pin 6-2, 7-6.         
	I started really well. I was very aggressive in the first set then in the second I started pulling back a little bit on my shots, said Ivanovic.         
	Fifth-seeded Russian Vera Zvonareva advanced after Frenchwoman Marion Bartoli retired with blisters on both feet when trailing 2-5 in the first set.         
	Russian qualifier Elena Vesnina went through 4-6, 6-1, 4-0 when 12th-seeded Slovak Dominika Cibulkova retired through illness. (AGENCIES)

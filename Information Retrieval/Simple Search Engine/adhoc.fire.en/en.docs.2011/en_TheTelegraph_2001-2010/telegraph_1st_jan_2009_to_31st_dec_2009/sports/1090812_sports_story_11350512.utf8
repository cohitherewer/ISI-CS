The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav is optimistic
                                                   Sourav is optimistic
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly believes that the absence of speedster Zaheer Khan in the upcoming tri-series in Sri Lanka and the ICC Champions Trophy in South Africa would not make much difference.         
	The former India left-hander, after attending the medical and fitness test organised by the Kolkata Knight Riders at the Eden under physio Andrew Leipus, said that India won the one-day International (ODI) series in the West Indies (2-1) despite the absence of Zaheer Khan and opener Virender Sehwag.         
	I know Zaheer has been ruled out for the rest of the year but I am not sure about Sehwag. But the duo did not play in the West Indies and India still managed to win the series.         
	In fact, Zaheers absence will be a good opportunity for the reserve players to prove themselves at the big stage, the 37-year-old added.         
	Speaking on the ongoing Ashes, he said that after winning the fourth Test at Leeds, Australia are the hot favourites to win the series.         
	Going by their momentum, the Aussies have an upper hand in the final Test at the Oval, Sourav stated.         
	Earlier, Sourav had an almost one-and-a-half-hour long session with Leipus. Besides Sourav, wicket-keeper batsman Wriddhiman Saha and pacer Sourav Sarkar attended the medical and fitness camp. Bengal batsman Manoj Tiwary, off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri and ICL-return former Bengal skipper Deep Dasgupta, who all are not registered with the Kolkata Knight Riders, also had a brief session with Leipus.         
	Asked why players like Ranadeb Bose, Sourashish and Manoj, who are not in the Knight Riders squad, attended the camp, Sourav said that these players were a part of Bengals scheme of things and so it would help.         
	They are part of the Bengal squad and its a good opportunity for them to be tested by Leipus before the start of the season, he said.

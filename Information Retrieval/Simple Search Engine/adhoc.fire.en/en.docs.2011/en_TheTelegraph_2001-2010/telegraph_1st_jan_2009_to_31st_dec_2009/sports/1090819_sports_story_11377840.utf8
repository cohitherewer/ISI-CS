The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ishfaq is doubtful for Shield
                                                   Ishfaq is doubtful for Shield
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagans Ishfaq Ahmed and Sheikh Azim are doubtful for the IFA Shield, the seasons first club tournament.         
	Ishfaq Monday pulled the hamstring on his left leg and the frontliner has been advised a weeks rest.         
	Central defender Azim picked up an injury to his knee during a match in Siliguri earlier this month and should be out of action for at least 15 days.         
	With Jose Ramirez Barreto yet to get into full practice mode  he too is nursing a hamstring injury  Ishfaqs unavailability is sure to make Bagan frown. However, coach Karim Bencharfifa said it was too early to rule the duo out of the Shield, which starts September 1.         
	We still have time. No point jumping to conclusions. And we are building a team for the season, not just for the IFA Shield, he said after practice on Tuesday.         
	If both Ishfaq and Barreto fail to make the cut for the IFA Shield, then the onus for goals will be on new recruit Edeh Chidi. And the man in question said he has no problem whatsoever.         
	Yes if Barreto and Ishfaq cant make the cut its our loss. But then we have a strong enough bench to deliver.         
	We are doing well. Had a great pre-season camp at Kalimpong and here too we are continuing with the good work.         
	We should have a good season this time, he said. Chidi, who had an unforgettable Calcutta season for Mohammedan Sporting in 2003, said he has matured as a player.         
	Things have changed a lot in Calcutta and so have I. If people here have become more professional, I too have developed as a player, he said with his customary swagger.         
	Chidi said he is combining well with Brazilian Marcos Pereira, giving enough hints that it wont be a bad idea for Bencharifa to go with him and the Brazilian for the IFA Shield.         
	According to the rules, a club can register only two foreigners for tournaments other than the I-League.         
	Meanwhile Ishfaqs agent Eddie Rock, who has been scouting for clubs  with hardly any success  for players like Steven Dias, Gourmangi Singh, Subrata Paul and Lalkamal Bhowmick, said that the Kashmiri might get a chance for trials at a Canadian club.         
	Ideally it should happen in December but since the I-League will be on, he may go sometime next summer.

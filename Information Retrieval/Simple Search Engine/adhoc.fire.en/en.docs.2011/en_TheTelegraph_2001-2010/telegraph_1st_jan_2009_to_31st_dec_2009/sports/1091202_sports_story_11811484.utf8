The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger and I are not friends: Uchitel
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tiger and I are not friends: Uchitel
                            
	New York: A nightclub hostess, said by the US tabloids to have been having a fling with golf star Tiger Woods, Tuesday said that the story was no truer than aliens on Earth.         
	Its the most ridiculous story. Its like they are asking me to comment if there are aliens on Earth, Rachel Uchitel told an American daily.         
	Tabloids have reported that Woods was having an affair with Uchitel and that the dalliance prompted a violent dispute between the golfer and his wife, leading to Fridays car accident.         
	Uchitel, a statuesque brunette pictured in figure hugging trousers, shirt and waist-length leather jacket, told the newspaper she had met Woods only twice while working as a VIP nightclub hostess.         
	Tiger and I are not friends, she said.         
	That she was in Australia at the same time as Woods this month was put down to coincidence.         
	Like I could just walk up to the 35th floor and go to the Presidential Suite if Tiger Woods was staying there? Like they would hand a girl a key at the front desk and let her go to Tigers room. I didnt see him at all in Australia. I was just there with friends.         
	Uchitel said the source of the tabloid stories was someone she knew slightly and was not close to. She described the woman as a drug user and high-priced prostitute.         
	This girl was never around me for any of the time she says she was. If I were having some big, lurid affair, I would not tell this girl. Its just ridiculous.         
	Uchitel called herself a homebody who spends most evenings with her dogs and a gay friend. She was hoping to end up with a nice, normal guy and worried that her reputation had been jeopardised.         
	I look like a home wrecker...         
	My statement, she said, is I work in clubs and I am a businesswoman. I do not have sex with celebrities and I have not had an affair with Tiger Woods.         
	Woods, 33, has refused to speak to police about the accident following which he was found unconscious and with light injuries.         
	Police investigating Tiger Woods mysterious latenight car crash are believed to be applying for a search warrant to obtain his medical records.         
	Officers from the Florida Highway Patrol want to establish whether the golfers facial injuries were caused by the incident, in which he hit a fire hydrant and a tree outside his home. On Monday night two officers were seen at the Health Central Hospital in Ocoee, Florida, where Woods was treated on Friday.         
	Police are also interested to discover if the moments leading up to the crash were captured by security cameras at the golfers  1.5 million property in a gated community in Orlando.         
	Woodss only comments about his wife have been to praise her for acting courageously in coming to his aid after he hit a tree near their Florida home.         
	He also denounced unfounded and malicious rumors that hed been fleeing an assault by his wife, a Swedish model.           (AGENCIES)

                                                   AIFF to clear stand on plan
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The All-India Football Federation (AIFF) has decided to come out with a white paper on its ambitious Goal 2011 project. The AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco has also called a meeting of the I-League clubs on April 17 to discuss the issue.         
	According to sources, some of the I-League clubs, which met in the I-League committee meeting on Tuesday, told the AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco that the federation should clear its stand on the project well before the start of the transfer season.         
	As per the Goal 2011 project, the AIFF plans to name a squad of 25 players, who would be reserved exclusively for national duty and not be allowed to play for their respective club sides till the Asia Cup in Doha.         
	Sources said that the Mahindra United president Alan Durante was the most vocal in the meeting and demanded details saying that would help clubs in recruiting players.         
	With the transfer window approaching, the AIFF should tell us whether they are really recruiting the players for the national team. We cant take the players unless the federation specifies its stand, the Mahindra official said.

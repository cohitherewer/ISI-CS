                                                   Mahesh, Mark march on
  - Prakash, Aisam give veterans a scare; Tearful exit for Ana ivanovic                         
	London: Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles survived a scare before defeating Prakash Amritraj and Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi to advance to the quarter finals of the Wimbledon mens doubles event on Monday.         
	The fourth-seeded Indo-Bahamian pair overcame some nervous moments before edging past the Indo-Pak pair 6-4, 5-7, 7-6 (7-3), 6-0 in a thrilling third-round encounter which was suspended for a while due to rain intervention.         
	Bhupathi and Knowles converted five of the 12 breakpoints they earned compared to Amritraj and Qureshi, who wasted two of the four that came their way in this match lasting two hours and 50 minutes.         
	The Indo-Bahamian combine faced a tough battle from the start as their unseeded rivals were not willing to let go without a fight.         
	Despite winning the first set life was never easy for the fourth-seeds as Amritraj and Qureshi staged a spirited fightback in the second and drew parity.         
	With scores level, the third set turned out to be a roller coaster ride as both sides fought tooth and nail to take the set to tie-breaker. However, Bhupathi and Knowles used their experience to seal it 7-3 after a 55-minute battle.         
	In the fourth set, Bhupathi and Knowles never allowed their opponents much leeway and raced away to 4-0 when rain suspended play for half an hour.         
	However, the break had very little effect on the performance of the Indo-Bahamian pair and they clinched the next two games to shut the door on their rivals.         
	For Amritraj and Qureshi, the Wimbledon round had been tough. They had to qualify for the main draw. Then the Indo-Pak duo, in the first round shocked the 16th seeded Australian-German pair of Stephen Huss and Ross Hutchins in five tough sets  6-4, 7-6 (12-14), 6-4, 3-6, 6-3. After winning the first set with ease, they lost the second in a tough tie-break. After the third set again going their way but losing the fourth, in the decider, Amritraj and Qureshi held their nerves to win in a flourish.         
	Their second round encounter with the unseeded Australian-German pair of Rameez Junaid and Philipp Marx was again a five-set duel. After losing the first two sets in a close contest, 5-7, 4-6, they came back in the third and fourth very strongly winning both in tie-breaks with a similar 7-3 score. It all boiled down to the final set and after 258 minutes of play, the Indo-Pak duo triumphed 8-6.         
	On the other hand, the fourth seeded duo has had an easier time so far. In the first round Bhupathi and Knowles eliminated qualifiers Somdev Dev Varman and Kevin Anderson 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 7-5, 7-5. A highly competitive match, the Indo-South African pair gave the Indo-Bahamian duo a run for their money.         
	After 195 minutes of battle, Bhupathi and Knowles emerged as winners because the qualifying duos lack of experience got in their way. This was Dev Varmans Wimbledon debut.         
	The second round match against the German-Austrian duo of Philipp Petzschner and Alexander Peya was easier for the fourth seeds. Winning the first two sets, they lost the third in a tie-break. In the fourth, Bhupathi and Knowles blew their opponents away 6-3.         
	In the quarter final, the opponents for the fourth seeds are yet to be determined.           (AGENCIES)

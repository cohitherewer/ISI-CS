The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saina makes history on Jakarta jaunt
                                                     Saina makes history on Jakarta jaunt
                  Saina Nehwal after winning the Indonesian Open on Sunday                     
	New Delhi: Saina Nehwal scripted history Sunday, becoming the first Indian to win a Super Series tournament after she clinched the Indonesian Open with a stunning victory over higher-ranked Chinese Lin Wang in Jakarta.         
	Saina clinched her maiden Super Series title, beating Wang 12-21, 21-18, 21-9 in an edge-of-the-seat thriller that lasted 49 minutes. Her triumph is the best-ever performance by any Indian woman and on a par with the All England Championship titles won by Prakash Padukone and her current coach Pullela Gopichand.         
	In the thrilling final, world No.8 Saina came from behind to outsmart world No.3 Wang and avenge her last weeks Singapore Open Super Series loss to the same rival.         
	Saina took her time to get into the groove as she struggled to gauge the game plan of Wang in the first game. Wang opened a 4-9 lead and rode on her smashes and better net play to pocket the first game as Saina was left to do the catch-up act.         
	But the Indian ace rallied her way back in the second game. Saina levelled the score at 5-5 and then moved together with her Chinese rival till 17-17 before surging ahead to pocket the second game 21-18.         
	In the decider, Saina was at her attacking best. She also showed better nerves in crucial moments. After moving neck and neck till 7-7, Saina went berserk by engaging her rival in soft dribble and net play to widen the gap to 15-9, before reeling off six straight points to seal her place in history.         
	Hailing Sainas victory as an important milestone in Indian badminton, the Badminton Association of India announced a cash prize of Rs 2 lakh.         
	It is a big moment in Indian badminton. We are proud of her achievement. We are announcing a cash reward of Rs 2 lakhs as an acknowledgment of Sainas hard work and achievement, BAI president V.K. Verma said.         
	It is a moment to cherish for Indian sports. Saina has done a lot of hard work but I will also want to thank the sports ministry for their support and financial help, he added. (PTI)

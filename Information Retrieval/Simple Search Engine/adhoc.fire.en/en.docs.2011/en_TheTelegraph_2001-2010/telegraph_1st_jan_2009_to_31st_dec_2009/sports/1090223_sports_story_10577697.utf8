The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev Asian Player of the Year once more
                                                     Jeev Asian Player of the Year once more

	Perth: Ace Indian golfer Jeev Milkha Singh has won the Johnnie Walker Asian Player of the Year award for the second time in his career.         
	Promising Korean golfer Noh Seung-yul won the Rising Star award, while Camilo Villegas of Colombia bagged the Young Player of the Year award at a gala evening here on Saturday night.         
	Jeev had an outstanding season last year and won four titles around the world and also claimed his second Asian Tours Order of Merit award in three years. He made history by becoming the first player in Asian golf history to surpass $1 million in earnings during a single season.         
	The Indian bagged the Asian Player award over Lin Wen-tang of Chinese Taipei and the Thai duo of Prayad Marksaeng and Thongchai Jaidee.         
	The 17-year-old Noh beat compatriot Bae Sang-moon, Ryo Ishikawa of Japan and Ben Leong of Malaysia for the Asian Rising Star award after an impressive performance in the Asian Tour last year.         
	World number nine Villegas beat Rory McIlroy of Ireland, American Anthony Kim, Germanys Martin Kaymer, Australian Rick Kulacz and Pablo Larrazabal of Spain for his award.         
	Villegas won the last two events on the US PGA Tour last season to figure among the worlds top-10.         
	Meanwhile, a seemingly perfect script went awry and Jeev dropped to tied 42nd after an even-par 71 in the third round of the Northern Trust Open in Pacific Palisades, California.         
	Going steady at three-under, the Indian went on to bogey three holes on the trot to settle for a three-day aggregate of three-under 210.         
	Daniel Chopra (214) also struggled before turning in a card of three-over 74 for a share of the tied 70th spot at the Riviera Country Club.         
	Playing his back nine first, Jeev birdied the 10th and kept the stretch bogey-free to take the turn at one-under.         
	Jeev bogeyed the first and second holes as well to go three-under before approaching the sixth hole, which marked the beginning of a bogey hattrick, which undid all his good work.         
	India-born Swede Chopra had just two birdies to show against five bogeys in the $6,300,000 event.         
	American Phil Mickelson (197) blasted a nine-under 62 to open up a four-shot lead over Argentine Andres Romero who fired 65 in the penultimate round.         
	Three off the pace overnight in his title defence at the Riviera Country Club, the American left-hander fired a flawless round to break away from a congested leaderboard and regain control of the tournament.

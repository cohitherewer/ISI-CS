	Hanoi: Four-time world champion boxer, M.C. Marykom began her campaign in a dramatic fashion, getting twice penalised for foul play in her 46kg first round victory over Ting Lo Yueh of China in the third Asian Indoor Games Sunday.         
	Mary Kom won 14-9 in a tense bout to advance to the semi-finals.         
	Four other women boxers also reached the medal rounds after victories Sunday. Chhoto Loura scored an easy 10-2 victory over Sri Lankas Kumari Nilmini to move into the 51kg semis while Kavita Goyat beat local boxer Huong Nguyen Thi Thiu 3-2 to make the 64kg final.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhaichung doubtful for derby
                                                     Bhaichung doubtful for derby
  - Super Sunday Barreto boost for Bencharifa; EB to start with two foreigners       SUDIPTO GUPTA            Bhaichung Bhutia at the club tent on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: The stage is set for the mother of all battles in Indian soccer. And, a starving stomach, according to many, provides an edge to ones performance. For the big guns  Mohun Bagan and East Bengal  the season so far has been far from satisfying their appetite and hence, their I-League clash on the artificial turf of the Salt Lake Stadium Sunday is expected to be a scorcher.         
	But theres a broken chord which may ultimately dampen the super show in the offing. Bhaichung Bhutia, the cynosure of every discussion for the last six months, thanks to his much-publicised row with his former club Mohun Bagan, has been declared a doubtful starter after he aggravated his hamstring injury when he pulled a muscle during practice Saturday. While his presence would bolster East Bengals challenge, his absence would certainly ensure a sigh of relief in the Bagan camp.         
	The derby, apart from the traditional essence of rivalry that it draws with itself, was also being touted as a perfect platform for him to inflict vengeance on Bagan, who had slapped a six-month ban. The news, thus, might have dampened the spirits of the East Bengal fans, who were looking to restore some of their lost sheen with a victory over the green and maroon brigade.         
	Treatment for my injury is on. Whenever Im trying to stretch, Im feeling the pain, Bhaichung said.         
	The Indian captain underwent an MRI later in the evening though, according to club sources, a decision will only be taken on Sunday morning.         
	Speaking on the high profile match, he said: Every match is important. But I dont need to prove anything to anyone. If Im fit I would always like to score.         
	East Bengals sagging fortune this season have received a much-required facelift in the form of Abel Hammond. The Ghanaian, a utility footballer well-off in the middle as well as upfront, has impressed with his fitness and penetrating abilities. If the coach decides to play him on the right flank, which looks more likely, Hammond can prove to be a handful for the Bagan left back N Mohanraj.         
	With Rennedy Singh, in all probability, starting as a left half and Riston Rodrigues and Mehtab Hossain in the middle, captain Syed Rahim Nabi will be pushed back to the left backs position. Mehrajuddin Wadoo, Govin Singh and Nirmal Chetri are the other men who will be guarding the red and gold defence.         
	Australian Secro Mitrovich might have a role to play later in the match.         
	For Bagan, mainstay Jose Barretos comeback after injuring his quadriceps muscle on the left leg will be keenly watched. While the Brazilian looks set to start, the make-or-break factor will be his durability for 90 minutes. Coach Karim Bencharifa echoed optimism as he said: Ill have a chat with Barreto and will decide accordingly. However, things as of now, are looking quite bright and if he is fit, he will definitely play the match.         
	Bagan might also be gambling with Sagram Mandy in the central defence and Manish Mathan in midfield. The move, if applied, will definitely be a courageous one from the Moroccan as both the players, who are fresh recruits this season, are yet to have a feel of such a high voltage derby. But Bencharifa argued: When I started playing Sagram, many questioned the move. But Im training them and I know how to use my players.         
	Besides Sagram, Rakesh Masih, Surkumar Singh and N Mohanraj are likely to man the defence. Marcos Perreira will partner Manish in the midfield with Snehasish Chakraborty and James Singh taking care of the flanks. The Barreto-Edeh Chidi combo will be on duty in the rival box.         
	The seasons first derby has always been a cherished encounter for the football fraternity. And this time, the match is poised to be an even more engrossing affair as both the teams, with their injuries and worries, experiences and inexperiences, are on an even pitch. As the bubble of expectations of millions of fans grows larger, it will only be decided Sunday whether it bursts or floats.

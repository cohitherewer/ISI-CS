The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I have no issues with Miandad, says Inty
                                                   I have no issues with Miandad, says Inty
                                Intikhab Alam       
	Karachi: Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam has played down reports of differences between him and teams batting consultant Javed Miandad over the method of Champions Trophy preparation.         
	Alam denied that he had any problem with Miandad and accused a section of media for interpreting the things in a wrong way.         
	We are good friends and dont have any issue with each other. Miandad has played under my captaincy and also when I was the Pakistan coach. Some people in the media are trying to create the misunderstanding between us and doing no good to the team, Alam said.         
	The issue gained prominence when a newspaper quoted Miandad on Wednesday saying that it was very difficult for him to work with the team without knowing the schedule of conditioning camp ahead of the eight-nation tournament commencing in South Africa from September 22.         
	No one has told me about the teams training schedule as yet, Miandad was quoted as saying.         
	The conditioning camp was originally scheduled to be held from September 1-10 in Lahore, where Miandad had ordered the preparation of grassy tracks for the batsmen to practise on.         
	But Alam later got the approval from the Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ejaz Butt and changed the schedule of the camp which is now being held in two parts.         
	The first part will continue in Lahore till September 6, followed by another five-day training in Karachi before the teams departure for South Africa on September 12.         
	Miandad would be working with the players in the second part in Karachi. In Lahore, we are just concentrating on physical training and allowing the players to have counselling sessions with psychologist Maqbool Babri, Alam said.         
	Miandad, who is also the PCB director of cricket, has been given the additional responsibility by the Boards governing council to improve the batting form of the team before the Champions Trophy.         
	Miandad has also been the Pakistan coach in the past but his stints have not been very successful.         
	Pakistan are due to leave for South Africa on September 17. (PTI)

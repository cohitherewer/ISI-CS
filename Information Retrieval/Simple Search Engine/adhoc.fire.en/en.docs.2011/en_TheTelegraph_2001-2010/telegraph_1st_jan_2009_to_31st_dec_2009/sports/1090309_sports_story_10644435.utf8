	Agartala: Bengal, last years Vijay Hazare Trophy runners-up, would look to go one better this year when they take on mighty Tamil Nadu in the final at the Maharaja Bir Bikram Stadium here on Monday.         
	Bengal, however, would have to play out of their skins to avoid a repeat of last years result.         
	The journey in the national one-dayers has been a joyful ride for Bengal so far. Captain Laxmi Ratan Shuklas young guns have won all their games in the prestigious tournament. But what must be a worrying factor for them is that most of the victories have come on the back of individual performances.         
	The Zonal matches failed to present too much of a challenge for the Bengal boys and in the knockout stage, Bengals batting has looked one-dimensional with the team relying heavily on middle-order star Manoj Tiwarys heroics.         
	Tiwarys has been a dogged performance so far but the team also needs useful contributions from the likes of wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman Saha and Dibyendu Chakraborty. The batsmen have to take the cue from Tiwary in posing a serious challenge to the Tamil Nadu attack, which is full of variety.         
	The Tamil Nadu side, captained by the able all-rounder R. Ashwin, boasts of big shots like Subramaniam Badrinath, S. Suresh Kumar and Abhinav Mukund in the batting department. The team from south have great depth in their batting and the lower middle-order, time and often, has come up with useful contributions.         
	Bengals run in the Ranji Trophy this season ended at the hands of Tamil Nadu. But Lakshmipathy Balaji, whose all-round performance was responsible for Bengals defeat, is away in New Zealand this time along with Murali Vijay and Dinesh Karthik, pillars of the Tamil Nadu batting.         
	Captain Ashwin observed that the depth in batting was an advantage for Tamil Nadu.         
	The depth in batting is something which is our advantage. They dont bat as deep as we do and we need to drive home that advantage tomorrow, Mukund said after the teams practice on Sunday.         
	What has been heartening is that somebody or the other has always stood up for us.         
	The pitches, throughout the tournament, have not offered too much pace or bounce and Monday will be no different. The 22-yard strip will definitely get slower as the day progresses and the spinners will be able to extract some purchase off the turf. Batting first would therefore be the best choice for the two captains on winning the toss.         
	Bengal suffered a last-moment jolt with off-spinner Ritam Kundu being ruled out of the final due to an injury on his left wrist. An SOS was immediately sent out to the Bengal selectors by the team management and off-spinner Priyankar Mukherjee found himself boarded on the Agartala-bound flight in the afternoon.         
	Mukherjee is not learnt to have set the Hooghly river on fire with his performance in the CAB domestic league but he was probably the only available choice with some experience. Incidentally, the off-spinner was reported to the Board of Control for Cricket in India last year with a suspect action.         
	Ashok Dinda needs to fire with the new ball for Bengal on Monday. The fast bowler has been subject to a lot of controversies of late and has been criticised in various quarters. Perhaps its time for him to silence his critics with a match-winning performance. In that case, the Bengal team surely would be best served.         
	Tamil Nadu, on the other hand, will be led by captain Ashwin in the spin department They also have a bunch of utility spinners who might turn out to be useful in these conditions.         
	According to Ashwin, the wicket needs sensible batting. Its not conducive to strokeplay. You need to bat sensibly on this wicket, Ashwin said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger Woods to take indefinite break from   the game 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Tiger Woods to take indefinite break from   the game 
            LARRY DORMAN               Tiger Woods                                 
	Asking for understanding from his fans, business partners and fellow competitors on the PGA Tour, Tiger Woods announced on his website on Friday that he will take an indefinite break from professional golf to try to rebuild his personal life.         
	Woods, the top-ranked golfer in the world, has not been seen in public since crashing his SUV into a neighbours tree in an early morning accident on November 27. He has spent the last two weeks in his Orlando home, recovering from injuries and hearing a flood of reports of marital infidelities linking him to multiple women that has swamped the worldwide airwaves.         
	By abandoning the tour for an unspecified time, Woods leaves golf without its No. 1 draw, television without its No. 1 ratings driver and his sponsors without exposure from the golfer who makes more than $100 million a year selling their products and building their brands.         
	It was not clear how he arrived at this decision or whether it was made in consultation with corporate sponsors or PGA Tour officials.         
	The tours official response was swift and supportive: We fully support Tigers decision to step away from competitive golf to focus on his family. His priorities are where they need to be, and we will continue to respect and honour his familys request for privacy. We look forward to Tigers return to the PGA Tour when he determines the time is right for him.         
	In his third statement since the accident drove him into seclusion, Woods used his site to reiterate and amplify his profound apologies for the fallout from the reported multiple affairs to which he had alluded but had not admitted.         
	I am deeply aware of the disappointment and hurt that my infidelity has caused to so many people, most of all my wife and children, Woods said. I want to say again to everyone that I am profoundly sorry and that I ask forgiveness. It may not be possible to repair the damage Ive done, but I want to do my best to try.         
	I would like to ask everyone, including my fans, the good people at my foundation, business partners, the PGA Tour, and my fellow competitors, for their understanding. Whats most important now is that my family has the time, privacy, and safe haven we will need for personal healing.         
	After much soul searching, I have decided to take an indefinite break from professional golf, the statement continued. I need to focus my attention on being a better husband, father, and person.         
	Woods and his wife, Elin, have been married for five years and have a 2-year-old daughter and a 10-month-old son.         
	Woodss decision to take the break for an indeterminate period will most likely shift the focus of speculation away from the almost daily updates on his dalliances to what date he will return to the sport he has dominated since 1997.         
	His recent pattern has been to skip the season opener in Maui and the Sony Hawaiian Open and begin his United States schedule at the San Diego Open at Torrey Pines Golf Course at the end of January. That event is scheduled for January 28-31 in 2010.         
	From there, to begin his run-up to the first major championship of the season at the Masters, Woods would normally play in the WGC.-Accenture World Match Play (Feb. 18-21), the WGC-CA Championship at Doral (March 11-14) and the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill (March 25-28). His next event would be the Masters, in Augusta, April 8-11.         
	Under normal circumstances, the odds on a healthy Woods missing the years first major championship would be astronomical. But the circumstances, since the car accident, have been anything but normal.         
	He finished his message with another plea for his family to be left alone as he and his wife work to reconcile. Again, I ask for privacy for my family, he wrote, and I am especially grateful for all those who have offered compassion and concern during this difficult period.

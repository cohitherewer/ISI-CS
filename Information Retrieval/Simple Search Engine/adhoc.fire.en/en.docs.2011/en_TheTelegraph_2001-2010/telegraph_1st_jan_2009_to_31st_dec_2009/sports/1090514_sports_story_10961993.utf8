The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Moody: Shot selection was poor
                                                   Moody: Shot selection was poor
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Centurion: It was billed as one of the big matches of the tournament but in the end the Mumbai Indians scored a rather easy win over the Kings XI Punjab at SuperSport Park on Tuesday evening.         
	While the Sachin Tendulkar-led team are now better placed to make it to the semis, Yuvraj Singhs team would probably have to win three out of three to make it to the final four. The Kings XI Punjab coach Tom Moody spoke to the media at a post-match news conference.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q After such a great start you must be disappointed with the way your team batted         
	A Its very disappointing. It was great to see Sunny Sohal take off like he did. He is up front to play his natural game and thats what he did tonight (Tuesday) and its a shame that his innings finished in such a lame way. That sort of set off the remainder of our innings. We failed to really execute our batting and our shot selection was reasonably poor. Okay, they bowled reasonably well but our shot selection after the first phase was disappointing.         
	What do you think about the way Sreesanth has been bowling in the tournament?         
	I think Sree has bowled well in patches. In every game, apart from this game, his first three-over spells have been excellent but his comeback over has been disappointing. (Dwayne) Bravo was on a bit of a roll tonight (Tuesday) and batted very, very well. He took to him first over and he was out of the game basically. That can happen to any bowler.         
	There are talks of the Indian and foreign groups in certain teams not gelling well. Has there been any communication problem within your team, given that the players are from different nationalities?         
	Not at all. We have no issues with that at all. One thing which we have got going for us is a good spirit and everyones enjoying each others company. And it doesnt matter whether you are a local Punjabi boy or a Sri Lankan or an Australian or an Englishman. We have no issues there.

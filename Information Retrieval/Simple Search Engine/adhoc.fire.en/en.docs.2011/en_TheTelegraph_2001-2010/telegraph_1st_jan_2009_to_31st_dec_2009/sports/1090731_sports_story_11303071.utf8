The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Schumi will relish latest challenge
                                                     Schumi will relish latest challenge
    - Return of champion with ruthless sporting soul could not be more timely           Kevin Garside            Michael Schumacher during a test drive with a Honda race bike at the Sachsenring racetrack near Hohenstein, Germany. A file picture                                 
	London: Old green eyes is back. And boy is Formula One pleased to see him. Never mind Ferrari, Michael Schumacher is digging the sport out of a hole following BMWs withdrawal from Formula One.         
	Schumacher has three weeks to prepare. He is ready now. He was born ready. It is Kimi Raikkonen who needs to book himself into a gym for a fortnight. There were some who inferred from Schumachers retirement speech at Monza in 2006 that the impending arrival of the Finn from McLaren was the factor that ultimately saw him out of the Maranello door. At 37, he wouldnt want to go up against the Kimster.         
	Raikkonen had a lucky escape. Schumacher would have swallowed him whole in those difficult first few months when nothing went right after Raikkonens debut win in Australia. Raikkonen ultimately recovered to win the championship by a point. Had Schumacher hung around he would have been celebrating an eighth world championship.         
	On paper, Schumacher is up against it. He has not driven a Formula One car for 17 months. At 40 he retains a high level of general fitness but has probably lost the sport specific endurance in the neck and shoulders that keep a drivers head upright around corners.         
	After five years going mouldy in the pipe and slippers, Mika Hakkinen, the driver Schumacher considered his greatest adversary, tested the McLaren around Barcelona and after 80 laps finished adrift at the bottom of the time sheets. Reason points to a similar outcome for Schumacher in Valencia. At least it would be if Schumacher were a reasonable man. He was never that in an F1 car.         
	We saw how Lance Armstrongs championship pedigree held up in the Tour de France. Third place after a four-year absence was arguably the equal of any of his seven victories when he reigned in the saddle. Armstrong and Schumacher share a pathological need to win. You can throw the name of Tiger Woods into that pot, too. None is easy to love. But admiration is universal.         
	F1 commercial rights-holder Bernie Ecclestone and Schumachers manager, Willi Weber, felt pressure might mitigate against a return. What were they thinking? Six years ago after his worst start to a season at Ferrari, Schumacher pitched up in the Scuderias heartland of Imola in the midst of a family crisis. His mother, Elizabeth, was terminally ill.         
	On the morning of qualifying, Schumacher was told his mother might not last the day. He put a Ferrari that had been nowhere in the preceding three Grands Prix on pole. That afternoon he flew to Germany to see his mother for the last time, to say goodbye. He learnt of her passing on the morning of the race. A few hours later he won his first Grand Prix of the season. That is how Schumacher deals with pressure.         
	Two years later at Monaco, with hegemony beginning to pass to Renault, Schumacher was briefly back in the ranks. He began the last lap in ninth place. There was a point to be won. He shoved his brother, Ralf, to within an inch of the wall as they burned towards the chequered flag vying for seventh place. Ralf called Michael a crazy man and refused to speak to him for days.         
	Schumachers teammate, Rubens Barrichello, was similarly discomfited, losing eighth place to him through the chicane after the tunnel. Barrichello was incredulous. Brother and partner should have known better. In remonstrating they revealed something of their own natures as well as shining a torch on Schumachers ruthless sporting soul. He had to win.         
	I recall one winter morning in Madonna di Campiglio at Ferraris international press week Schumacher readying himself for the ski race on the final day, a bit of fun among friends.         
	He was intercepted by a photographer requesting a unique shot at the top of the mountain.         
	Thunder rolled across those asymmetric features. Quickly, he barked, I have to test the piste. Even downtime is taken seriously by Schumacher. He won, of course.

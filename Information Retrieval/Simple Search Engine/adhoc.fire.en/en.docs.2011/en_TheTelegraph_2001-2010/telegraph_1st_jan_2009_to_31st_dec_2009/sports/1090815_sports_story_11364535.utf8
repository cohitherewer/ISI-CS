            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Chinas Xie Xingfang celebrates her victory over Hong Kongs Mi Zhou on Friday. (AP)                           
	Hyderabad: On a day of upsets at the World Badminton Championships, the mens and womens top seeds bowed out of the competition at the quarter final stage Friday. Malaysian Lee Chong Wei lost to Indonesian sixth seed Sony Dwi Kuncoro 16-21, 21-14, 12-21 while Hong Kongs Mi Zhou was defeated 15-21,18-21 by Xie Xingfang, the Chinese fifth seed.         
	The Indian mixed doubles duo of Jwala Gutta and V. Diju too lost, and rather tamely, to Indonesian second seeds Nova Widianto and Liliyana Natsir. The scoreline: 16-21, 14-21.         
	Jwala and Diju began well, racing to a 9-6 lead in the first game but unfortunately, didnt stick to their tactics. Their experienced opponents made the Indians dance to their tune. Jwala seemed to be in a rush to finish off points and neither did Dijus unforced errors help.         
	Backhand magician, Indonesias Taufik Hidayat emerged victorious after a tremendous battle with young Danish Jan Jorgensen. The fourth seed won 21-19, 21-19 with a controversial line call on match point. The draw has begun to get tough. I hope my semi-final match against Jin goes well Saturday, Taufik said.         
	Meanwhile, as the upsets continued, Chinese seventh seed Lu Lan saw off Danish third seed, Tine Rasmussen, She will meet teammate Lin Wang in the last four. Hongyan Pi of France, seeded eighth, beat German contender and 11th seed Juliane Schenk in a very close contest and will play Xie next.         
	Chinese second seed Jin Chen defeated Simon Santoso of Indonesia in their last-eight encounter.         
	The most spectacular match of the day was that between world No.5 Lin Dan and veteran world No.3 Peter Gade of Denmark which the former won 22-20, 21-13. Dan will play Sony in the semi-finals.         
	I was mentally prepared to play Lee (Chong Wei), said Super Dan. Ill have to change tactics now as Sony (Dwi Kuncoro) is a very good contender. Dan is gunning for a record-breaking third world title in a row.         
	It wasnt the best match of my life but it was one of the better ones, said Sony, the silver medallist from the last World Championships.         
	In mixed doubles, the Danish contingent pulled off remarkable upsets. The seventh seeds Thomas Laybourn and Kamilla Rytter Juhl defeated the Chinese third seeds, while sixth seeds Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Christinna Pedersen got the better of the fourth seeds from China.         
	Its very surprising for us to have two mixed doubles teams in the semis. That means two medals for Denmark, said coach and former player Kenneth Johansson. Its after a really long time that China will not win a medal in mixed doubles.         
	Indian results         
	Saina Nehwal lost to Lin Wang (Chn) 16-21, 19-21; Jwala Gutta/ V. Diju lost to Nova Widianto/ Liliyana Natsir (Ina) 16-21, 14-21

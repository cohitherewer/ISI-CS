The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ITF should back players, feels Nadal
                                                   ITF should back players, feels Nadal
                      
	Paris: Rafael Nadal called on the International Tennis Federation (ITF) to stick up for players against the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada)s out-of-competition drug-testing rules.         
	Nadal has criticised the rule in the past, and did so again Friday at the French Open.         
	I know that drugs is not an easy matter to deal with, but weve paid the price for this, Nadal said through a tournament translator. And, in fact, the ITF should take measures. I dont have the impression that its good to put so much pressure on us. They harass us, I think.         
	A new Wada rule says athletes must say where they will be for one hour each day, so they can be found for testing. Serena Williams is among the tennis players who say thats too invasive, and Nadal complained that its tough to keep Wada updated on his whereabouts.         
	The ITF should do something about it, Nadal said.         
	Its not nice when they are at your room at eight in the morning. They call you and say, We are here, and you have two more hours for sleep, no? Nadal said. Thats not nice.         
	Nadal also backed his pal, Richard Gasquet, a promising French player who allegedly tested positive for cocaine.         
	OK, Gasquet has been tested. I support him. Im certain that hes not taking anything. Hes not taking cocaine, Nadal said. I know him. Hes a good friend of mine, and I discussed this with him last week.         
	No, no, impossible. Hes most certainly not taking cocaine... If you kiss a girl whos taken cocaine, anything can happen, and thats the truth. Thats reality, and this can destroy your life or your career, rather, and this is most unfair.

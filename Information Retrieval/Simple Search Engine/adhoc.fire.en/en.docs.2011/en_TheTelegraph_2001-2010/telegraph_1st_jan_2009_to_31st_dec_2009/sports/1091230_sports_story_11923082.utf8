The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wrong timing for Woods
                                                                                                                       7                                      Wrong timing for Woods
            NYT NEWS SERVICE                      
	Rejoice, monologue writers  motorists could soon be driving under the influence of Tiger Woods, opening another round of possibilities for late-night talk show hosts.         
	Woods has been the subject of an almost endless stream of jokes since crashing his sport utility vehicle in his driveway, leading him to acknowledge his marital infidelities and take an indefinite leave from professional golf. Among other things, his skills behind the wheel have been compared to his precision when driving a golf ball.         
	And now, in what is not a joke, but might sound like a set-up for one, an audio magazine in May will release Woodss 2001 best seller, How I Play Golf, as an audio book. According to the magazine, 53 percent of audio book customers listen to the books while driving.         
	In the audio book, Woods shares the psychological practices he uses daily to keep his game in top shape and help him transcend all the ups and downs of golf, according to a description in the magazines spring-summer 2010 catalogue, which was mailed recently to bookstores and journalists.         
	The catalogue went to bed months before the scandal unfolded, Anthony Goff, publisher and director of the magazine, wrote in an e-mail message. We had no idea hed be all over the news for anything other than his golf game.         
	Woodss rating has plummeted recently to 33 percent, from a pre-scandal 85 percent, according to a poll; advertisers including Accenture, Gillette and Tag Heuer have either dropped him or removed ads that feature him.         
	 We feel any marital infidelities wouldnt impact his solid golf advice in the least, Goff wrote. We were selling this title into stores for Fathers Day promotions not for personal relationship advice, but for tips on the game, which are still completely valuable to anyone who knows golf.

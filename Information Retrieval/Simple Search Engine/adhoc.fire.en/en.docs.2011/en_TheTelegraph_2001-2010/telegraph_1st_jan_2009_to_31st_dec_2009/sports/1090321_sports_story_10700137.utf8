The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Raghuvansh has edge in Leger
                                                                                                               Raghuvansh has edge in Leger 
            STAR RACER                                  
	Calcutta: Raghuvansh and Grand Madame are cut above the rest in the five-horse field vying for the 2,800m St Leger, which takes the centerstage in Saturdays seven-event card. In the Derby, last month, the Arti Doctor-trained Raghuvansh had met a tartar in Abs Fabs. However, the Royal Kingdom son had finished more than two lengths ahead of Grand Madame in a fast run race. A slow pace, or a crawl in the Leger, may definitely worry Raghuvanshs jockey Daniel Grant. If so happens, the Oaks winner, Grand Madame, may make Raghuvanshs task a bit difficult.

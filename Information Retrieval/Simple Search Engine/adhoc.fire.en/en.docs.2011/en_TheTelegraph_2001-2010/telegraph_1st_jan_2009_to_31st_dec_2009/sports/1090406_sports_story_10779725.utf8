The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB agreed to forego money: Audit
                                                   PCB agreed to forego money: Audit
                      
	Karachi: The audit into Pakistan Cricket Boards accounts since 2003 has revealed that the board agreed to forego a lot of money due from India for the organisation of the 1996 World Cup.         
	According to sources, former PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf apparently agreed to accept only 30 per cent of the original money due to Pakistan and also agreed to surrender the interest on the stuck-up money for the last 13 years.         
	The BCCI, which was a member of the 1996 Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka joint organising committee (PILCOM) and handled the financial affairs, had held back a big portion of the share due to Pakistan from the revenues generated by the World Cup.         
	The money was held back since 1996 as the BCCI claimed it had taxation issues with its government and a broadcast dispute. Sources in the Pakistan board said that the amount due to Pakistan was around $4 million and some partial payments were made since 1996 by the Indian board.         
	Many other anomalies have also been found in the financial affairs of the board by the auditors which would soon be made public, a source said. (PTI)

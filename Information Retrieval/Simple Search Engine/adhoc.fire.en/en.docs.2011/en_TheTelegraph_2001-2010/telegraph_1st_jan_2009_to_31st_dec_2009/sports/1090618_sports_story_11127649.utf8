The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We werent 100 per cent on the field, admits Dhoni 
                                                   We werent 100 per cent on the field, admits Dhoni 
    - If we perform badly, then we have to accept the booing, says captain           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                            
	London: Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the Team India captain, was rather sombre during his interaction with the media (at Trent Bridge) on Tuesday evening.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Having been booed during the closing stages and while speaking at the post-match presentation         
	Wasnt the first time... Wed been booed (at the Wankhede) after a Test against England... Even my last rites were performed (in Ranchi) when we crashed out of the 2007 (50-over) World Cup... If we perform badly, then we have to accept the booing... It wouldve been unusual had the fans not booed... The way to avoid that is to win 100 per cent of the matches, but thats just not possible.         
	Starting the tournament with two wins and finishing with defeats in all three Super Eight matches         
	The momentum was never with us... The wins (in the first round) shouldve been enough to give us that... Quite a few of the batsmen, including myself, were out of form... In fact, a majority didnt perform.         
	Time for soul-searching         
	Yes... Its not about what you can achieve, but what you actually do... We werent up to international standards and Im being honest about it. We didnt get it right as a unit.         
	Coach Gary Kirstens view that fatigue played a big role in the teams failure to qualify for the semi-finals         
	We werent 100 per cent there on the field... Dont know whether fatigue was the reason for others, but I didnt feel fatigued... Its not that I was in the same state like when I opted out of the Test series in Sri Lanka (last July-August)... Thats the time I didnt even want to have nets... Id been exhausted... Theres no point throwing the burden somewhere else... Were the ones to be blamed.         
	Difference of opinion with the coach on the fatigue issue         
	[The media manager, Anirudh Chowdhury, ensured that this question remained unanswered.]         
	On why other teams havent talked of fatigue         
	Fatigue cannot be the only reason.         
	Having taken to the World T20 with injuries and niggles         
	Somebody had an ankle problem, somebody had a shoulder problem... That impacted on our fielding.         
	Demands of todays cricket         
	Its coming to be more demanding mentally and players will, I think, have to take breaks to be at peak fitness... A months break could allow them to play for an extra two-three months.         
	Whether it could reach a stage where, because of the need to stay fit, some may have to choose between playing in the IPL and turning out for the country         
	Its tough to say from my side, but fitness is a factor... Cricketers are intelligent and will come up with something.         
	Being choked by the bowlers in the Super Eights         
	Batsmen have to find a way to get out of such situations... Its for the batsmen to innovate.         
	Lack of transparency over Virender Sehwags shoulder injury         
	Everything cannot be revealed... I cant open my heart out and reveal strategies... Its better for the opposition to spend half-an-hour planning for Sehwag, instead of letting them know (through the media) that hes unfit... I prefer not announcing my 11 till, say, an hour before the start... That way, I have 14-15 players whore mentally prepared instead of just 11.         
	Going through the roughest patch as captain         
	(Grins) Its tough, but its part of the game... In four-and-a-half years Ive probably seen everything in cricket... Pretty early in my career, one of the seniors told me that being praised would take me to the seventh heaven and criticism would make me fall on the floor... That would be no good for me and I should take the middle path... Ive tried doing so... In India, criticism gets more expressed in cricket, but Ive (still) chosen the right sport.         
	Learning more from failures than successes         
	You cannot always be performing at your best... The players attitude matters and, at a time like this, positive thoughts can turn to negative... We lost today, but Im happy the intensity was there.         
	Finally, what to expect from the next big tournament, the Champions Trophy in September-October         
	Well be fitter players... The World T20 has gone for us and we cant do anything about it...

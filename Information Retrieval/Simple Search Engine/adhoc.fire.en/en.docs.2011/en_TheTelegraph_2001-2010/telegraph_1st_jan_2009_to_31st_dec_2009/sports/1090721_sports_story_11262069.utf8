                                                   Golfing gala draws record entries
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Telegraph Cup presented by Senbo, in association with Ballantine, will tee-off at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) on Tuesday.         
	This year, the century-old golfing tournament has been divided into two categories: the Merchants Cup  for corporate houses with at least three executive golfers based in eastern India and The Challenge Cup  for smaller business houses.         
	A record 109 teams, including sides from Assam, Jharkhand, Jamshedpur and Jamalpur will participate in the meet.         
	The Merchants Cup will be a stroke-play competition with players from different handicap categories. Each team will consist of not less than three players and not more than four with the best three scores counting towards the team aggregate. Former Jharkhand chief minister, Arjun Munda, will represent the Tata Steel team. The Challenge Cup will see 48 teams vying for top honours. Each team will have four players with only three scores counting.         
	This is the first time that more than hundred teams are participating. I hope to see great golf in the next four days, said M.M. Singh, CEO of the RCGC. The finals in both categories will be played on Friday.

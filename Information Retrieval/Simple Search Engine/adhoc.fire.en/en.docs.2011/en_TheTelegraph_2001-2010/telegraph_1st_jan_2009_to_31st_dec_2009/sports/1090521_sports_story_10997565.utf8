                                                   Chris Lewis gets 13-year sentence
                      
	London: Former England fast bowler Chris Lewis was jailed for 13 years on Wednesday after being found guilty of smuggling cocaine into Britain in his cricket bag.         
	A jury at Croydon Crown Court near London convicted Lewis of trying to bring more than $215,000 worth of the drug into the country from St. Lucia, packed in cans of fruit and vegetable juice.         
	Lewis, 41, played 32 Tests and 53 one-dayers in the 1990s. He had claimed in his defence that he did not even know cocaine could be converted into the liquid form in which it was discovered in his luggage.

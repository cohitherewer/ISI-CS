The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Birmingham blues for Ancelottis men
                                                                                                                       7                                      Birmingham blues for Ancelottis men
                      
	London: Chelseas stuttering form continued on Saturday when the Premier League leaders kicked off a hectic holiday programme with a 0-0 draw at Birmingham City.         
	Roberto Mancini began his reign as Manchester City manager with a 2-0 home victory over Stoke City and there was good news for another of the Premier Leagues Italian coaches when Gianfranco Zolas West Ham United climbed out of the bottom three with a 2-0 home win over Portsmouth.         
	Tottenham Hotspur remained in fifth place after a 0-0 draw at Fulham and the points were also shared at Sunderland who drew 1-1 with Everton.         
	Liverpool moved up to seventh with a 2-0 win at home to 10-man Wolverhampton Wanderers, while Wigan Athletic against Blackburn Rovers ended 1-1 as did Burnleys home match with Bolton Wanderers.         
	Chelsea moved five points clear of champions Manchester United despite failing to score for the first time in 34 games. United can narrow the gap at Hull City on Sunday.         
	Its not a good result for us considering what we did on the pitch because Chelsea played well, had a lot of chances, had a lot of heart and the keeper for Birmingham made some fantastic saves, Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti said.         
	Mancini, who replaced Mark Hughes as Manchester City manager last weekend, overcame his first hurdle as goals from Martin Petrov and Carlos Tevez wrapped up the points against Stoke to keep City in sixth place, three points off the top four.         
	Rafa Benitezs Liverpool edged to a much-needed 2-0 win over Wolves in a dismal affair at Anfield with goals from captain Steven Gerrard and Yossi Benayoun.         
	Wolves were reduced to 10 men soon after the break in bizarre circumstances.         
	Defender Stephen Ward, already on a booking, needlessly fouled Brazilian midfielder Lucas only for referee Andre Mariner to book his team mate Christophe Berra before reversing his mistake and handing Ward a second yellow.

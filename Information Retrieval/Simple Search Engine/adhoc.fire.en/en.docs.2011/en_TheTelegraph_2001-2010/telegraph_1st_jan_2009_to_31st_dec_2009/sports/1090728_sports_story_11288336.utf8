The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Flintoff move worries Gary
                                                     Flintoff move worries Gary
          
	Johannesburg: India coach Gary Kirsten has warned that a lot of players could go the Andrew Flintoff way and quit Tests to prolong their one-day and Twenty20 career as it assures them of more money for less cricket.         
	Its a natural progression that the guys are then going to say Im not interested in bowling 25 overs in a day when I can bowl four overs in a six-week period and earn three times as much, Kirtsen was quoted as saying by a cricket website.         
	Flintoff will quit Test cricket after the ongoing Ashes and the 31-year-old blamed the decision on his injury-ravaged body.         
	Kirsten said Flintoffs decision could influence a lot of other players.         
	The worrying side that Im seeing is that a guy like Andrew Flintoff, a high-profile cricketer, has now made the decision to leave Test cricket, because he feels that he can get more out of his body and earn much more money by moving away from Test cricket and playing ODIs and Twenty20 cricket. Hes perfectly right in his decision. Why not? the former South Africa opener said.         
	He said ODI games should be lessened and Twenty20 games increased to strike the right balance.         
	India play six Tests this year. Is that sufficient or are there other priorities? I dont know. Its quite interesting that weve got a Twenty20 World Cup in April next year in the West Indies and Team India dont play one Twenty20 game until that tournament starts, Kirsten pointed out.         
	What should be happening is that we should be going on tour and playing six Twenty20 games and one or two 50-over games. I think thats going to happen. Its just a matter of time, he added.         
	For the record this is not the first time that Kirsten has voiced his concern. He had blamed fatigue, arising out of the Indian Premier League, for Indias disastrous performance in the ICC World Twenty20 in England in June.         
	Its not an excuse, but fatigue was a factor... The players arrived tired (after a gruelling IPL) and never got to the level of intensity which wouldve worked... It didnt help that we played two matches (against Bangladesh, Ireland) of relatively less intensity, in the first round of the World T20... Also, we had a fair number of players not in the best of form and some were carrying niggles (from the IPL).         
	Kirsten, in fact, had indirectly blamed the BCCI, too. Some of the players only had a couple of days off (before leaving for England)... Because we werent together as a unit, we came with little preparation... Wed lost the connection (during the IPL).         
	His comments stirred a hornets nest with some in the BCCI opening coming out in support of the IPL.         
	All the members of Indias World Twenty20 squad were part of the IPL and they arrived in England for the warm-up games which began on June 1, after playing a tightly scheduled five-week tournament in South Africa that ended only on May 24.         
	Virender Sehwag and Zaheer Khan picked up serious injuries during the IPL. Sehwags shoulder problem eventually ruled him out of the World Twenty20 while Zaheer, who admitted he was lucky to sit out for only four weeks, recovered just in time after missing most of Mumbai Indians campaign and the practice games in England.         
	Prior to the IPL, the BCCI had scheduled five ODIs and a Twenty20 International in Sri Lanka between January 28 and Febuary 10 to fill the gap after the two-month tour of Pakistan was cancelled in December following government advice.

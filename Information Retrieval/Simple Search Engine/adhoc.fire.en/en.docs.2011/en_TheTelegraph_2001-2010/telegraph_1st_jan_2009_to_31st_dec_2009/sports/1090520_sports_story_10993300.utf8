The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Super Kings, Kings XI in crunch tie
                                                     Super Kings, Kings XI in crunch tie
                  MS Dhoni                     
	Durban: The Chennai Super Kings, smarting from a defeat to tournament-laggards Kolkata Knight Riders, take on the Kings XI Punjab in a do-or-die encounter on Wednesday. At stake is a semi-final berth in the Indian Premier Leagues edition No.2.         
	The Super Kings are currently placed second with 15 points after winning seven of their 13 matches. Just one point behind them are the Yuvraj Singh-led Kings XI.         
	The Super Kings were on course for a semi-final spot but the Knight Riders spoiled their party Monday night with a seven-wicket victory. Mahendra Singh Dhonis men now face a do-or-die match against an equally desperate Kings XI, on a roll with two consecutive wins. Even without their run-machine Matthew Hayden, the Super Kings posted 188 against the Calcutta team but couldnt defend it, mainly due to poor bowling.         
	Skipper Dhoni would hope his side shrug off the disappointment and come out firing on all cylinders Wednesday.         
	The Kings XIs bowling looks in good shape with Irfan Pathan and Brett Lee in fine rhythm. Skipper Yuvraj has been a revelation with the ball, claiming two hattricks in the tournament, one coming against the Chargers Sunday.         
	Meanwhile, the Super Kings coach Stephen Fleming was of the view that the stunning loss to the Knight Riders will not hurt his sides semi-final chances. Fleming in fact said that the defeat has actually helped as the players are now out their comfort zones.         
	We are still in a good position. Looking at the table, there have to be a lot of things working against us for us not to go through and thats without winning the match, Fleming said.         
	We have personal pride in terms of that performance. We want to finish well with a win to get up the table. But as far as the competition goes, we are still in a healthy position, he added.

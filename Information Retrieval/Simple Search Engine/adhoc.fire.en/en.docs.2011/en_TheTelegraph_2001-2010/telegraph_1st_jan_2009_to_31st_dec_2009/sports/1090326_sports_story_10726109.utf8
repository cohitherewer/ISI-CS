The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bobs radio move
                                                   Bobs radio move

	Calcutta: Duleep Mendis would like you to believe that Sri Lanka experimented with the one-way radio during a warm-up match on the controversial tour of Australia, in 1995-96, but its the late Bob Woolmer who used it during an ODI  South Africa versus India, in the 1999 World Cup.         
	That was at Hove, where India lost by four wickets, and no sanction had been sought from the International Cricket Council.         
	Expectedly, the one-way radio created quite a flutter, with Match Referee Talat Ali quickly getting into the act and asking Woolmer to stop communicating, even before the Mohammed Azharuddin-led Indians had realised what was happening.         
	Woolmer, who loved making the most of technology, as he once told The Telegraph, had been offering suggestions to captain Hansie Cronje (who too is no more) and strike bowler Allan Donald.         
	From what one recalls, the matter ended with Woolmer apologising for violating the spirit of the game. The influential Dr Ali Bacher was then heading the South African board and, so, ensured a bigger issue wasnt created.         
	Thats the last time a cricket coach tried to be innovative in a big way. Now, the talking point could well be John Buchanans move to rotate the captaincy in edition No.2 of the IPL.         
	Woolmer died in mysterious circumstances (during the 2007 World Cup) before T20 had really taken big strides globally. He may not have done a Buchanan, but would certainly have attempted something new.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Morris to be mediator
                                                   Morris to be mediator
                      
	London: England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) managing director Hugh Morris has been entrusted with the job of brokering peace between feuding captain Kevin Pietersen and coach Peter Moores.         
	The ECB finds itself in a tricky situation with reports claiming that Pietersen has threatened to resign after Moores and other selectors ignored former captain Michael Vaughan for the West Indies tour.         
	All team matters are dealt with by Hugh Morris. There will be a full review of the tour of India, which was a difficult tour in view of what happened before it. I dont believe all this stuff Im reading about Michael Vaughan, ECB chairman Giles Clarke was quoted as saying by a newspaper.         
	Morris played a crucial role in Englands return to India after the Mumbai terror attacks for a two-match Test series and this is going to be another challenge for the respected ECB official.         
	The daily quoted an unnamed source as saying that the relationship between Pietersen and Moores is beyond repair and their difference started long before the Vaughan incident. The Vaughan issue is something of a red herring. The problem goes back further than that, the source said. (PTI)

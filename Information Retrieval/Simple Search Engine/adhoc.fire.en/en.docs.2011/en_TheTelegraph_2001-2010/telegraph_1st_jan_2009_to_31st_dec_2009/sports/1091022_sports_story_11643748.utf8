The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bari: Nobody is perfect, but Younis is a good captain
                                                     Bari: Nobody is perfect, but Younis is a good captain
  - Changes likely in Pakistans squad for ODIs against New Zealand       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Younis Khan                                 
	Calcutta: Nobody is perfect, but Younis Khan is a good captain... The chairman (Ejaz Butt) has done the right thing by retaining him till the 2011 World Cup...         
	Yet another endorsement for Younis, this time from former captain and chief selector Wasim Bari, currently the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB)s chief operating officer.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph, from Lahore, on Wednesday afternoon, Bari said: We dont believe that the other seniors in the team have reservations over Younis, but thats not to say healthy differences cant exist Fifteen individuals make up a team and, as you know, no two persons are alike.         
	According to Bari, it wasnt necessary for the PCB to call for a closed-door meeting between Younis and the other seniors (T20 captain Shahid Afridi, former captain Shoaib Malik, Mohammed Yousuf and Kamran Akmal).         
	Thats just not needed... If a revolt was brewing, would this team have won the World T20 and made the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy? As Ive pointed out, some differences are possible... Years ago, wed experienced the same thing... However, theres absolutely no need for anybody to try and make a mountain out of a molehill... The players have accepted Younis as their captain.         
	Indeed, fellow-Pathan Afridi has gone on record saying Younis was like his elder brother and that he held him in the highest regard.         
	Afridi, who is in the form of his life, timed that rather well.         
	Bari, one of the all-time great wicket-keepers, added: This business of asking for the captains head doesnt make sense... India launched their Champions Trophy campaign as the No.1 team in the world, but didnt make even the semi-final. Yet, nobody asked for (Mahendra Singh) Dhonis removal... People in all quarters should encourage our team to get better, not paint a negative picture...         
	Youniss first assignment after being retained is against New Zealand  ODIs and T20 Internationals in the UAE and the Test series in Daniel Vettoris home turf.         
	Meanwhile, one learns that the ODI squad could see as many as four changes, with Abdul Razzak, Faisal Iqbal and Sohail Tanveer possibly making a comeback and rookie opener Khalid Latif getting a call-up.         
	Veteran Salman Butts name is doing the rounds, too.         
	Mohammed Asif (for non-cricketing reasons), Misbah-ul-Haq, Imran Nazir and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan are the ones on a distinctly sticky wicket.         
	The ODI, T20 and Test squads are to be announced on Thursday.         
	Incidentally, chief selector Iqbal Qasim would be travelling with Younis and Co. and will serve on the tour selection committee.         
	Younis wants only the captain, coach (Intikhab Alam) and the chief selector to have a say in finalising the XIs. Out of the picture are the vice-captain and the manager.         
	For now, at least.

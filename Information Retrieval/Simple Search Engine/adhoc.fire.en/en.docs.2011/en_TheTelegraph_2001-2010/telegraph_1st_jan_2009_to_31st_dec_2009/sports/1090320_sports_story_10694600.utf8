The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Weve got our noses in front, says Dravid
                                                   Weve got our noses in front, says Dravid
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hamilton: Rahul Dravid said on Thursday that India had their noses in front at the end of the second day of the first Test after reaching 278 for four.         
	Dravid himself made an important contribution to that score with 66 while Sachin Tendulkar was still at the crease on 70. Gautam Gambhir scored a solid 72.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	The Indian performance         
	In terms of runs we did quite well. It was a hard-fought day. There was something in the wicket right through the day. They pitched the ball in the right areas. Pretty happy with the score since there is a lot of time left in the Test match.         
	On the batting to come         
	Four wickets down means that we have our noses slightly ahead. Sachin is still batting really well. Yuvi, Dhoni and the lower-order can bat, too. Probably we may have liked to have lost one wicket less. But we are happy with the position and hopefully if we can build on it tomorrow (Friday)... The first session is going to be critical.         
	The lead India are looking at         
	The more the merrier... I dont think there is a number in place at this stage. The wicket is going to remain the same right throughout. It is not easy to score runs against a harder and newer ball. If we can get 150 ahead it would be fantastic, an ideal scenario for us.         
	If India can win this Test         
	Let us not get ahead of ourselves. Let us take it session by session, a day at a time. We have got out noses ahead at the end of Day II. Lets win a few more sessions and then start thinking about it day by day.         
	The wicket         
	There was something in it for the bowlers right through the day. The ball kept swinging a little bit. They were bowling in areas where it was not ease to drive. Even when you are batting right, you always felt that you were never really in. We had to work hard for our runs. Gautam batted very well upfront and Sachin played really well towards the end to get us to a good position.         
	The way he expects the wicket to behave in the coming days         
	Even in 1998, I remember the wicket started off the way it did yesterday (Wednesday) but settled down to become a very good batting wicket as the Test went on. In 2003, the wicket seamed a lot when 150 was a good score. This one has been a good, even wicket, there is something in it for the bowlers. If the batsmen do well, you can still score runs.         
	The break before the Test series         
	It has been an enjoyable period for me. I have actually had the time off to go back and play some domestic cricket.         
	His innings         
	I really felt good today. My feet really moved well and I got into the right position right through the day... Was scoring at fairly decent clip. Got a pretty good one at that stage Even after the ball was sort of 60-65 overs old, it was still seaming a little bit. Overall quite satisfied. But it would have been nice to go on and get a big score         
	On what has made the difference this time         
	Just the fact that we got here early has made a difference, no doubt about that. Playing the game up at Rangiora for Canterbury was good, gave us a chance to get used to the conditions rather than coming in cold for the Test players. The fact that we got that game in and the fact that we got some good quality practice over the last week  the coaching staff put in a lot of effort to ensure that we were ready and hit the ground running hard.         
	If this idea of playing in the domestic circuit while touring helps         
	Felt really right going into this Test match. Never felt better physically and mentally than getting into this Test match. Its a good lesson for the future.         
	On what gives him the most satisfaction         
	I just love the game, truly love the game. I have always played this game since I was a young kid, I have loved batting, I have loved being part of victories and making contributions to wins. I think that sort of gives me the challenge now  its not really the number of runs and centuries I score now. Its really about if I can make a contribution to a winning team in Test matches in India and abroad I think that is what gives me most satisfaction. I love the ebb and flow of the game, I love what it has taught me over the years and love what it is teaching me even today.         
	On equalling Mark Waughs world record of 181 catches         
	Its nice, it would have been nice to have caught one more yesterday (Wednesday) and got past the record. I guess I have played a lot of Test matches and its always nice to take catches. Taking catches has sort of given me as much pleasure as scoring runs has  being part of someone elses success as a catcher. That has been a thrilling experience. To have taken so many catches is also to me a reflection of the quality of attack that I have been lucky to have played with in all these 12-13 years.         
	The best of his catches         
	Hard to take a call... You look at these catches and you think of them in terms of the context of the game and how they helped the team win. I took Damien Martyn in the Adelaide Test off Sachins bowling and we went on to win the Test match. It was a critical phase; Sachin dismissed Martyn and Steve Waugh and I caught them both. I took Martyn at slip, it was an important one, one that I valued and cherished. Another one off Mark Waugh at backward short-leg in the Chennai Test of that great series in 2001 off Harbhajans bowling. Mark Waugh was batting 50-60 and we couldnt give them a big lead. It was a sharp chance to my right. These two are the ones that will probably stand out in memory.

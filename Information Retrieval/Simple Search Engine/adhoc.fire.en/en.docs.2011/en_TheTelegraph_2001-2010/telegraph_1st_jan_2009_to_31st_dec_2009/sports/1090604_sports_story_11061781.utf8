                                                   Zaheers injury a concern: Sourav
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly may not be a part of the Indian team any longer, but that he has not lost his touch was evident from the elan with which he answered questions on Team India and cricket on Wednesday. Sourav was officially inducted into ESPN-STAR Sportss commentary team at an event in the city and the former India captain will hold the commentators microphone in the semi-finals and final of the World T20 Championship in England, which begins on Friday.         
	For those with a penchant for facts, Sourav is once again making his debut, though off the field, in England, the country where he slammed two centuries on his Test debut in 1996.         
	Sourav backed Team India to clinch the T20 title: If you ask for my favourite, its India. They are a strong side and Im hopeful that they will do well this time as well to retain the trophy. But to be honest, no one can be picked as a favourite in the T20 format Anyone can win on a given day.         
	On whether he foresees pressure derailing Team Indias campaign, the stylish southpaw said that in T20, all the teams are under pressure. Pressure is on everyone And I think this Indian team handles pressure well. One also has to remember that the last time (in 2007), when India won the World T20 Cup, they were a young side. Two years down the line, they have become more matured and experienced and that will definitely help, Ganguly asserted.         
	He was also all praise for India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni: Dhoni has been doing a fabulous job as the captain. He has been producing results for the past two years, not only in T20 but also in Tests and one-day Internationals. I have been in those shoes and I know how difficult a role that is. He is only 27 (years old) and has truly been doing a brilliant job, said the man who took India to the ODI World Cup final in 2003.         
	He also played down Indias 9-run loss to New Zealand in a warm-up tie on Monday saying that Dhonis boys have had quite a good record in T20s.         
	He voted for Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir as the ideal and best opening duo for India. But when reminded that since Sehwag was nursing an injury what if someone like Rohit Sharma is pushed up, Ganguly said: I dont really know Rohit hasnt done the job before, so I dont know how he will perform.         
	Sourav expressed concern over Zaheer Khans injury saying, He has been playing a lot of cricket His injury is definitely a concern But injury is part and parcel of the game and you will have to cope with it.         
	When asked whether T20 is more of a batsmans game, the owner of 11,363 runs in ODIs refused: T20 is not necessarily a batsmans game. In fact, theres a lot of pressure on the batsman A bowler has 24 deliveries (the 4-over limit in T20) to prove himself while for a batsman a single delivery may bring about his downfall. So the batsmen are always under pressure.         
	When asked whether his one-time teammates will take his criticisms from the commentary box sportingly, Sourav had a mischievous answer: Lets see Its just the beginning. I hope they shake my hand after the match!         
	His message for the Indian team ahead of the World T20 bore a stamp of his own inimitable style: Just win it, once again!

	The Indo-Bahamian pair had to battle for one hour and 27 minutes to dispatch a fighting South African-Austrian pair in the second round.         
	In singles action, Rafael Nadal won his first match since May when fellow Spaniard David Ferrer retired with a left knee injury in the first set of their match on Wednesday.         
	Nadal led 4-3 when Ferrer informed the chair umpire he could not continue. Afterwards, Ferrer said the injury wasnt serious and that he would likely be back on court next week for the tournament in Mason, Ohio. Nadal, who looked strong on the court as Ferrer made him run, will face German Philipp Petzschner in the third round on Thursday.

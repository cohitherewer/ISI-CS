                                                     Dont rush your return, surgeon tells Kevin
                  Pietersen                     
	London: A top consultant surgeon has advised Kevin Pietersen not to rush his return to competitive cricket as it could jeopardise his career.         
	Pietersen had to undergo an emergency surgery Wednesday to heal his ankle and was ruled out of the remaining matches of the Ashes series.         
	Jason Dr Nandlal, a consultant surgeon at the Cadogan Clinic, said Pietersen must sort out his Achilles tendon problem biomechanically as well as surgically if he wants to prolong his career.         
	It does not matter if you are Auntie Maude or one of the worlds top athletes: it takes at least six weeks for soft tissue to heal. You cannot rush a return from this type of surgery because you are likely to cause a rupture which can either mean a long time out or the end of an athletes career, Dr Nandlal said.         
	The specialist said that Pietersen must amend some of his body movements to overcome the problem completely.         
	Biomechanics looks at bowlers and changes their actions to protect their backs, it may well be that Pietersen will have someone look at the way he runs to see if they have eliminated all the problems that might have brought about this problem.         
	This happened with his England teammate Andrew Flintoff when he had a persistent heel problem. Eventually they not only sorted it out surgically, they got to the bottom of it biomechanically, Dr Nandlal told an English daily.

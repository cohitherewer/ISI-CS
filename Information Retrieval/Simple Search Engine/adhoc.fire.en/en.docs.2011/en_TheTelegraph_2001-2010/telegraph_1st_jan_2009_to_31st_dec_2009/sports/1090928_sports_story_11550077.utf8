The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Injured Ryder ruled out, fined 
                                                   Injured Ryder ruled out, fined 
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/ Johannesburg: New Zealand all-rounder Jesse Ryder has been ruled out of the rest of the Champions Trophy after tearing an abductor muscle while scoring a half century in his teams Group B match against Sri Lanka on Sunday.         
	Hes had it for a long time, this injury. It repaired itself but he did it all over again today, captain Daniel Vettori told a news conference after New Zealands 38-run win. Its very sad for him and I dont think it is a good prognosis.         
	New Zealand have asked to bring in Aaron Redmond, a top-order batsman who can bowl leg spin, and will wait for the International Cricket Council (ICC) to decide if the injury is serious enough to allow a replacement for Ryder, who was forced to bat with a runner on Sunday.         
	There were more bad news for Ryder who was fined 15 per cent of his match fee after being found guilty of breaching the ICC Code of Conduct, according to an ICC release.         
	In a hearing convened by Match Referee and former India pacer Jawagal Srinath, the player pleaded guilty to contravening Level 1.2 of the ICC Code of Conduct which relates to abuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground equipment or fixtures and fittings.         
	The incident took place when Ryder was out after scoring 74. The player walked off the pitch and as he was approaching the dressing room, he struck and broke a chair with his bat.         
	This sort of behaviour is entirely inappropriate for any player, Srinath said.         
	It is understandable that Jesse was disappointed after his dismissal, especially given the fact that he had sustained an injury during his innings and knew he would probably be out of action for a considerable time as a result.         
	But he must maintain a certain level of self-control and clearly Jesses actions went beyond what would be deemed acceptable.         
	That said, he pleaded guilty to the offence, apologised at the hearing and this was his first offence as far as the ICC Code of Conduct is concerned so the fine is at the lower end of the scale, said Srinath.         
	All Level 1 breaches carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand and a maximum penalty of 50 per cent of a players match fee. The charge was brought by the third and fourth umpires, Simon Taufel and Aleem Dar.

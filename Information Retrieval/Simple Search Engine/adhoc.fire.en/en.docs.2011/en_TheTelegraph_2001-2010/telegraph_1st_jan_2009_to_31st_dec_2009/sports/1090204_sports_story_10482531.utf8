The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AIFF mulls   3-foreigner rule change
                                                   AIFF mulls   3-foreigner rule change
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Clubs in India may soon be allowed to recruit four foreign players for the I-league and the Federation Cup. Currently, a club can employ only three foreigners for the two All India Football Federation (AIFF) tournaments.         
	However, the fourth foreigner will have to be a player of Asian origin as per the new rule of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).         
	The new law, which has been christened the three plus one rule was approved by the AFC and is already in place in countries like Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia.         
	The addition of an Asian quota, the AFC felt, would add an extra dimension to the game in the continent and help the beginning of a genuine inter-continental transfer market. The global credit crunch is another factor that gave the new rule a gentle push  both in terms of the search for cheaper talent and income from new markets.         
	Asked whether the rule would be applied in India also, the AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco said: We will have to weigh the pros and cons of the rule before implementing in India.         
	Colaco confirmed the rule will also be applicable in all AFC club tournaments, including the Asian Champions League and the AFC Cup, where two Indian clubs play every season.         
	The rule was approved in a meeting of the AFC last year, the AIFF general secretary informed. South Korea was initially hesitant to accept the rule but it was passed by the committee.         
	The three plus one rule can also open up new avenues for the Indian players. They may now get opportunities to play in other Asian countries. So far, clubs in most of the Asian countries were heavily dependent on their Brazilian and African recruits but the new rule would force them to look for players within the continent.         
	The rule is already in full force in Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia. Japanese club Gamba Osaka have paid over $3 million to bring former Shimizu S-Pulse hero Cho Jae-jin back from his K-League sojourn.         
	As per the new rule, a club can also recruit an Australian player under the Asian quota. Korean clubs have already engaged a few Aussie players. In China, too, the Australian players are in great demand.         
	Clubs in South Korea and Saudi Arabia are also trying to bring back Asian players from the European circuit. South Korean striker Seol Ki-hyeon has recently left Fulham for Riyadh powerhouse Al Hilal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shuklas fitness is a worry for Bengal
                                                                                                                                   Shuklas fitness is a worry for Bengal
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Skipper Laxmi Ratan Shuklas fitness will be a worrying factor for Bengal as they take on Karnataka in their crucial tie of the Ranji Trophy Super League starting in Mysore from Tuesday.         
	Shukla sustained a hip injury in the Baroda match         
	Its not as bad as it was last Thursday (during the third days play), but there is still some pain. Its a strain in the quadriceps. I am trying hard to get fully fit before Tuesday. This is a very crucial match for us and all I know is that I have to play, Shukla informed from Mysore.         
	Is there a chance that he might not play? I dont want to entertain any negative thoughts at this juncture. The physio (Shyam Sundar Jaypalan) is trying his best to get me fit and I hope that by tomorrow (Monday), I will be in a much better shape, said Shukla.         
	While Wriddhiman Saha and Ashok Dinda joined the team from Mumbai on Saturday evening, Manoj Tiwary and Rohan Banerjee joined their mates on Sunday. Banerjee is likely to get a look-in with Deep Dasgupta coming lower down the order.

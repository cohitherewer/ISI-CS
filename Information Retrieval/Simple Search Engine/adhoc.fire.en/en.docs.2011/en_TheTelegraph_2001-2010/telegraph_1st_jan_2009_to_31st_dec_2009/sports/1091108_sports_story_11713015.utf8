    - Sixth ODI dew could prove to be an important factor today             UMANAND JAISWAL            Sachin Tendulkar during Saturdays nets in Guwahati. (Reuters)                                 
	Guwahati: When Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Ricky Ponting take the field Sunday, they will fervently hope that Guwahati proves to be second time lucky for them in a match, the outcome of which will see either Australia take the series or India live to fight another day.         
	The last time they led their respective sides here, the rival captains finished on the winning side  Australia beat New Zealand by 44 runs on November 9, 2003, while India put it across arch rivals Pakistan by five wickets on November 5, 2007. Dhoni had even pocketed the Man of the Match for his 63 off 77 balls.         
	Acknowledged in most quarters as able leaders, both know that the past counts for nothing and every game is a fresh beginning.         
	Given the twists and turns in the seven-match ODI series for the Hero Honda Cup, which the visitors are leading 3-2, both the teams appeared focused on the eve of the sixth match.         
	We are not thinking far ahead. We are focussed on tomorrow (Sunday)s match, said Dhoni.         
	The unprecedented interest in the game has also given rise to expectations with fans hoping for a Sachin Tendulkar encore.         
	The Indian batsmen had a light session with coach Gary Kirsten.         
	Left-arm pacer Ashish Nehra, however, did not have a bowl as he appeared a bit under the weather while Virender Sehwag did not turn up for Saturdays optional warm-up.         
	The Australians, on the other hand, indulged in a bit of jogging, stretching, football and rugby. Cameron White took a close look at the pitch with Doug Bollinger.         
	East Zones representative in the BCCIs grounds and pitches committee, Ratul Das, and Assam Cricket Association (ACA) curator, Sunil Baruah, said that the wicket should produce 275-300 runs if the batsmen apply themselves in the first 10-12 overs and then go for their shots.         
	The wicket is firm. The ball should come on to the bat. If the batsmen adapt themselves to the conditions we should have a good contest. It will seam a bit in the morning, Das observed.         
	Dew and light will, however, remain big factors in the outcome of the match. But the ground staff were confident of getting the field ready for the 8.30am start. We will get the entire ground covered and start the mopping up operations from 6.30am to get the game started in time. Light is okay till 4.15pm, he said.         
	Match Referee Chris Broad, too, enquired about the dew.         
	According to a source, Match Referee Chris Broad has already spoken to the ACA on whether the floodlights at the stadium can be used, if needed. The ACA has agreed to the request.         
	However, for lights to be used in a day match, the same should be mentioned in the playing conditions. Or else, the Match Referee will need the consent of both the teams to make it functional.         
	Both teams were tight-lipped about the playing XI, but it is unlikely that Australia will field either of the replacements who arrived Friday.         
	A tight security blanket has been thrown in and around the stadium and the team hotels as well.

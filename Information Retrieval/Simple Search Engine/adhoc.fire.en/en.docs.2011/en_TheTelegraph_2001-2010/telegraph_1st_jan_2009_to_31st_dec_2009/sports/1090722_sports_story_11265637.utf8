                                                   AIFF contest hots up
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The power struggle within Indian footballs parent body may raise its ugly head when the All India Football Federation (AIFF) brass meets on Wednesday to select a new general secretary.         
	While senior officials said their task would be to pick the best man from among the 40 odd applicants, back room politics has already begun in earnest to push the favourites for the high-profile job.         
	Sources in the federation said that although the Goa Football Association (GFA) secretary, Savio Messias stands a good chance, his elevation to the top post could depend on one senior AIFF official.         
	It is no secret that the official and Messias dont see eye to eye and the former would not like the GFA secretary to occupy the chair for the next four years. In that case, this official may try to push the candidature of some relatively unknown applicant.         
	While the names of the AIFF deputy general secretary, Gautam Kar, former Vision India in-charge Shaji Prabhakaran and former Olympian S.S. Hakeem are also doing the rounds, a section within the AIFF is plotting to plant a weaker general secretary to maintain its hold on the federation.         
	That would serve their interest, said a senior AIFF office bearer. Some people close to another top official are actively involved in promoting an insignificant candidate from northern India, alleged the office bearer.         
	The selection to the post of the chief executive officer (CEO) of the I-League too is likely to be taken up. Although experienced candidates like Anil Kamath (director, AIFF competitions) and Harish Rao (former Mahindra footballer and coach) are in the fray, the federation may continue its hunt for a foreigner to head the sensitive department.         
	Thats absurd, said an AIFF official. The finances of the federation are in doldrums. In this situation, these people are trying to appoint a foreigner with a high salary, he said.

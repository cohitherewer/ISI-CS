                                                     Border: Ponting is our best after Bradman
  - Legend pays tribute to the man who broke his record               Ricky Ponting                           
	Melbourne: Paying tribute to the man who broke his record as Australias highest Test run-getter, former captain Allan Border said Ricky Ponting is his countrys greatest batsman after the incomparable Don Bradman.         
	Rickys done it all. I think hes probably our second best batsman after Bradman, said Border after Ponting went past his 11,174 runs on the second day of the third Ashes Test to become Australias most prolific batsman.         
	Border compared Ponting with another Australian great Greg Chappell but said by the time the current captain hangs up his boot he will surpass all his illustrious compatriot except Bradman.         
	Weve had players like Greg Chappell and Steve Waugh who Ive seen and other champions of the past, he said.         
	Its hard to go past Greg Chappell as No. 2 for Australia. He was a wonderful batsman, a wonderful catcher and bowled a bit. I havent seen any pre-war stuff obviously.         
	But looking at averages and reading and talking to old cricketers over the years I believe that by the time Ricky finishes he will be our next best, Border said.         
	What makes Ponting above the likes of Chappell and Waugh, according to Border, was the Tasmanians adaptability to all three formats of the game.         
	He excels at all forms of the game  Test, one-day and now Twenty20. Hes been very adaptable.         
	There is extra pressure on batsmen these days to score quickly; to come up with all the shots in one-day cricket and particularly Twenty20. Test cricket hasnt changed much but scoring rates have improved, probably due to shorter forms, Border said.         
	Its just hard to draw marks against him, on his record, number of runs and hundreds hes scored, where and how hes done it. By end of his career his figures will be incredible. I reckon hes our next best, he added.         
	Borders 11,174 runs came in 156 Tests from 1978 to 1994 at an average of 50.56 and Ponting claimed the record in his 134th Test, averaging 56.         
	Ponting is now chasing the only two other members of the 11,000-run club  Brian Lara (11,953) and world record-holder Sachin Tendulkar (12,773).         
	Border believes Ponting is a complete batsman, and the only chink in the Tasmanians armour was batting on slow and turning pitches.         
	Hes got all the shots, he pulls and cuts so well makes him very difficult to bowl to. There are guys who can pull and cut well, but arent so good when they come onto the front foot or they might prefer one side of the wicket to the other.         
	Ricky can also take on pace. Hes pretty fearless. I just reckon when youve got those sort of qualities youre a pretty complete player. The only real problem Ive seen in his game is, when the pitches are slow and the ball is turning he struggles a bit. But thats something hes worked on and got better at, he said.         
	Despite the duos 19-year age difference, Border and Ponting crossed paths on the cricket field as after quiting international cricket, the veteran played on for Queensland in pursuit of winning the once-elusive Sheffield Shield.         
	I played against him when he was a young punk. You could see the talent straight away. People had been talking about this young kid from Tasmania for years.         
	He was a precocious talent. Rod Marsh as the academy coach had been pushing his bandwagon as the best young player he had seen. So I wasnt surprised when I saw him, Border said.         
	It was also no surprise that Border was impressed. During their first encounter, at Brisbanes Gabba in October 1994, Ponting scored 119 and 33. In their second and last meeting, in November 1995 at Bellerive Oval, the present Australian skipper made a pair of unbeaten centuries.         
	He had all the right ingredients including a bit of mongrel about the way he played his cricket, said Border.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clarke rises to second spot
                                                     Clarke rises to second spot
            A STAFF REPORTER            Clarke                           
	Calcutta: The winners have taken all, it would seem, after Australias brilliant victory in the fourth Ashes Test at Headingley. The International Cricket Council Test rankings released Monday have rewarded the Australians who did their bit towards doing the hosts in.         
	Australia vice-captain Michael Clarke has achieved career-best placing of No.2 on the batsmens list while captain Ricky Pontings innings of 78 has put him back up to seventh in the rankings, an improvement of two places.         
	Clarke is now just seven ratings points behind Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara and has pushed Indias Gautam Gambhir into third place after his 93 in Leeds helped his side to an innings victory.         
	Australias Marcus North has broken into the top-30 with his second century of the Ashes series, and is now ranked 29th, making a leap of 17 places and claiming his highest ranking.         
	Englands Paul Collingwood has slipped six places to drop out of the top-20 after failing to score in the first innings at Headlingley and then departing for just four in the second.         
	Sachin Tendulkar (No.14), V.V.S. Laxman (No.17) and Virender Sehwag (No.18) are the other Team India batsmen in the top-20.         
	In the rankings for Test bowlers, Australias Peter Siddle has made it into the top-20 for the first time with a jump of eight places to 17th.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Milito scores Inter winner
                                                                                                                       7                                        Milito scores Inter winner
                  Diego Milito                     
	Milan: Diego Militos penalty five minutes from time gave Inter Milan a deserved 1-0 home win over Fiorentina on Sunday and extended their Serie A lead to seven points.         
	AC Milan rose to second after substitute Klaas Jan Huntelaar netted his first two goals for the club deep into injury time to seal a 2-0 win at Catania.         
	The Dutch striker has floundered since a close season move from Real Madrid but he finally showed his worth by powering in Filippo Inzaghis layoff and then producing a perfect chip.         
	Juventus, who host Inter next Saturday, slipped to third after losing 2-0 at Cagliari despite dominating for spells.         
	Argentina striker Milito converted Inters spot kick after being brought down, having earlier missed an easy chance.         
	Champions Inter, chasing their fifth straight scudetto, thought they had gone ahead early in the second half when Walter Samuels header was controversially ruled out for shirt tugging.         
	Alberto Gilardino hit the post in Fiorentinas only real chance and Inter forward Samuel Etos shaky form continued when he wasted a late one-on-one with goalkeeper Sebastien Frey.

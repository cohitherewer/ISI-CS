                                                   Nomination snub irks Smith, Majola
                      
	Johannesburg: South African skipper Graeme Smith says his team would look to get over the disappointment of being ignored for the ICC annual awards nominations by lifting the Champions Trophy starting September 22 here.         
	Though disappointed that none of his teammates were considered worthy of individual nominations, Smith said the Proteas strive for collective recognition.         
	It is not individual recognition that drives us. We are driven by what we want to achieve as a team and have had an amazing couple of years, Smith said in a pre-event press conference in Potchefstroom.         
	It is a little disappointing that not a single South African made the shortlist in any category, he added.         
	Smith said being left out of the nominations list would motivate the team to do better. That shows the strength of the team and perhaps the lack of the ICC award nominations could be a motivating factor, Smith said.         
	South Africa will open their Champions Trophy campaign on September 22 against Sri Lanka in Centurion.         
	Meanwhile, outraged by the exclusion of South African players from the ICC annual awards nominations, Cricket South Africa CEO Gerald Majola has questioned the credibility of the list, saying he cant figure out the selection criteria.         
	To me, it looks like the only way to get on these nomination lists is to play the Ashes, Majola fumed.         
	Unfortunately, our players dont play for England or Australia. That seems to be the criteria to select these awards. I dont know what the criteria are for these nominations but I simply cant believe that this has happened to the South African players, the CSA chief told a cricket website.         
	My personal opinion is that this doesnt lend credibility to this years awards, for sure. To rub salt to our wounds, the awards ceremony is being held in our country, he added.         
	None of the South African cricketers were picked for the final nominations, dominated by Indians, Englishmen and Sri Lankans. The awards would be given out at here on October 1.         
	Majola said the selection panel for the awards nominees seems to have completely ignored the Proteas excellent Test and one-day performance last year, during which they also became the worlds No. 1 side in both forms of the game.         
	I am totally dismayed and disappointed. The last season was one of the best ever for South Africa and there were a lot of outstanding performances by our players, Majola said.         
	Former pacer Allan Donald, who was a part of the selection panel, said he had nominated a couple of Proteas players and was surprised to see none making the final list.         
	I am surprised to see that there is no one from South Africa in the final list, he said.           (PTI)

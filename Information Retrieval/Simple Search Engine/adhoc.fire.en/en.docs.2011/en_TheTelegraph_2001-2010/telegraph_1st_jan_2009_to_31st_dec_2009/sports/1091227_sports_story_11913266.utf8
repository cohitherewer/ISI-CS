    - Captain Dhoni feels Kotla pitch will assist the spinners             JAYDEEP BASU                            
	New Delhi: Back at the helm after two matches, Mahendra Singh Dhoni is in no mood to take things lightly when India and Sri Lanka lock horns in the fifth one-day International of the Karbonn Cup at the Kotla on Sunday.         
	When asked whether India would tinker with the playing eleven, the skipper was quick to point out that he thought differently on the issue.         
	I think a margin of 4-1 win in the series is always more impressive than winning it 3-2, said Dhoni, after a long practice session at the Kotla on Saturday morning.         
	I dont think we will be going for too much experimentation. May be a change here and there. But this is the last match of the year and we want to finish it on a winning note.         
	Given Indias strength and performance in the current series, Dhoni has every right to feel confident.         
	That the Kotla match has been rendered inconsequential is mainly because of the two Delhi boys  Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli  who hit fine centuries in the fourth ODI in Calcutta to ensure India sealed the series with an unassailable 3-1 lead.         
	In the morning, if Sachin Tendulkars absence from the nets raised some eyebrows, Ashok Dindas possible inclusion in the eleven remained the point of discussion. The Bengal boy had a long bowling session at the nets and so had Sreesanth, who has made a comeback to the squad after recovering from a bout of swine flu.         
	Asked whether Dinda would get the nod on Sunday, Dhoni said he was not in a position to announce the team. Both Dinda and Sreesanth looked fit to play, he said.         
	Tendulkar had come to the Kotla with the team but did not practise. Dhoni said the maestro was fit and very much in contention to play the final one-dayer on Sunday.         
	Although India have already pocketed the series, Sundays encounter is surely to be witnessed by a capacity crowd at the Kotla.         
	With Virender Sehwag, Gambhir and Kohli playing sensational cricket, there are many reasons for the crowd to flock to the stadium to watch their favourite stars in action.         
	There is no doubt that India, in this series, owe their success to the batsmen. So dominating has been the Indian batting that they have demolished the rivals even without the presence of star players like Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh.         
	The crowd would definitely like an encore on Sunday but it remains to be seen how the batsmen of both the teams fare on the relaid turf at the Kotla.         
	Though the curator has promised lots of runs, at least for the team batting first, many feel the pitch has enough grass to make the batsmen uncomfortable.         
	Dhoni felt the pitch might have some surprises in store for both the teams.         
	Its a relaid turf and a day game. I have a feeling the scenario may change. This time the Kotla wicket will be different. The spinners will definitely come into action, commented Dhoni.         
	Sangakkara said his team were in a positive frame of mind and the margin of the series was not the true reflection of the strength of the islanders. There wasnt any huge difference between the sides. In both the sides, the batsmen dominated while the bowlers were patchy.         
	Perhaps our bowlers should have bowled better, said the Sri Lankan captain.

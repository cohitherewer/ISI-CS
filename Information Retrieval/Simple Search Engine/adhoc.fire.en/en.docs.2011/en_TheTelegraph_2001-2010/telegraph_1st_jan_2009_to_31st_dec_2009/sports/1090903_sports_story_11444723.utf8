                                                   Dravid hits half century 
                      
	Bangalore: S. Badrinath (90) and Rahul Dravid (63) hit sparkling half-centuries to guide India Cements to a 25-run victory over BSNL in a rain-delayed Group D match of the BCCI Corporate Cup here Wednesday.         
	Put into bat, the Dravid-led India Cements posted 253 for five in 47 overs before returning to restrict their opponents to 228 for nine to stay in contention for a semi-final berth. BSNL, who had lost to Air India Red Tuesday, crashed out of contention with their second successive defeat.         
	In Mohali, Avik Chowdhury made a classy 110 as Indian Revenue edged out Indian Tobacco Company (ITC) by six runs in a tense Group A match. Batting first, Indian Revenue ran into a crisis before Aviks 157-ball knock and Amitabh Velaskars run-a-ball 41 helped them reach 255 for eight from their allotted 50 overs. In reply, ITC finished at 249 for nine.         
	In Visakhapatnam, Gagan Khoda (105) and Virat Kohli (73) led the onslaught as the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) spanked Madras Rubber Factory (MRF) by 81 runs in a Group B match. Opting to bat first, ONGC scored 329 for nine in their allotted 50 overs. Chasing 330, MRF could only manage 248 for nine, riding on S. Sreerams 103-ball 108 and Y. Gnaneswara Raos 54.         
	In Dharamshala, All India Public Sector Sports Promotion Board (AIPSSPB) crashed out of the inaugural meet after heavy rain washed out their crucial Group C match against Indian Oil. AIPSSPB are out of contention for a semi-final berth as they had lost their tournament opener against Tata SC Tuesday.

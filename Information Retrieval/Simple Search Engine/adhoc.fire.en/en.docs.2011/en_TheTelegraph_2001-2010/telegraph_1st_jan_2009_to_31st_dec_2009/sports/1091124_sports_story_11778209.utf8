            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Ravindra Jadeja, the new hope for India in their search for an all-rounder, believes that the Indian Premier League provided the platform he needed to make a mark in international cricket.         
	But remind him of his early days and the 20-year-old will be humble enough to admit that he was overawed by the publicity that comes with cricket in this country.         
	I was really nervous in the beginning. I dont come from a big city and international cricket, for me, initially, was really difficult to handle. But now I have learnt how to handle all this, Jadeja, in the city for Saurashtras Ranji tie against Bengal, said.         
	Asked if he enjoyed the media glare, the Rajasthan Royals player said: Its nice to know that people and the media have interest in you. But, of course, there are some difficulties as well.         
	He also felt that Aussie great Shane Warne (the Rajasthan Royals captain) and Team India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni had, as leaders, something in common  both encouraged the youngsters.         
	They have their own style, but both support the youngsters well. However, one cant compare Dhoni and Warne, he said. He also felt that he needed to tighten his technical skills before aiming for a Test call-up.         
	I need to work harder and improve my technique. But as with cricketers, I also dream of playing Tests one day, he signed off.

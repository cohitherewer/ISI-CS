                                                     Nabi: Now we can have a good sleep
            A STAFF REPORTER              Sunil Chetri                      
	Calcutta: Syed Rahim Nabis friendly taunt at a photographer turned out to be so prophetic! On the eve of East Bengals I-League match against Mohun Bagan, Nabi riled the photographer for running after the stars. Ignore me today, but tomorrow when I score two goals there will be a rush, and people will have to plead to take my photo, Nabi had said in jest.         
	Well, it turned out to be just that. Nabi scored two goals in the first half and created one for Sunil Chetri as East Bengal finally managed to beat Mohun Bagan at the Salt Lake Stadium. The crisis man for every coach, Nabi has always revelled under pressure. His dedication, guts and determination have won him many an admirer  Subhas Bhowmick and national coach Bob Houghton, at the top of the list.         
	Finally we have won, huh? Nabi said as he swept off beads of sweat from his forehead. Nine matches we didnt win against them. For two years we had to live through this jinx. Now we all can have a good sleep, Nabi was talking fast and furious.         
	We had a plan and we all stuck to that. Our coach (Subhas Bhowmick) deserves the credit for this victory. He kept saying we can turn it around. And slowly we started believing in ourselves, Nabi said.         
	Nabi said he thrives when he has Surkumar Singh to complement him. I enjoy playing with him.         
	The days other scorer Chetri, though, was reticent. Those nine matches never had a bearing on my mind, I took every match as a fresh start, the India international said.         
	Nabis first goal pleased him the most. He came from nowhere, took their defence by surprise and finished it in style. I havent seen such a well-planned and well executed goal in this I-League, he said.         
	East Bengals win came at a price though. Mehrajuddin Wadoo, will miss the next match due to a double booking.

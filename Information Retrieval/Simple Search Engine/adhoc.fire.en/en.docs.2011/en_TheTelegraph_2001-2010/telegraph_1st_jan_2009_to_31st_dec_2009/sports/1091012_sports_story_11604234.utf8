    - India blue batting crumbles against fiery Munaf and Tyagi                   The India Red team with the NKP Salve Challenger Trophy in Nagpur on Sunday. (PTI)                           
	Nagpur: Munaf Patel and Sudeep Tyagi took seven wickets between them as India Red won the NKP Salve Challenger Trophy, steamrolling Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his India Blue teammates by seven wickets in an extremely lopsided final here Sunday.         
	Having won the toss, India Red captain Subramaniam Badrinath put the rivals in and unleashed his fiery pace attack which bundled out India Blue for a paltry 84 in 27.1 overs with Munaf (4/21), Tyagi (3/20) and Ishant Sharma (2/26) leading the rout.         
	And it took India Red just 20.3 overs to cruise to 85 for three, with Shikhar Dhawan (32) and Harshad Khadiwale (28 not out) helping them to the facile win.         
	Put into bat, Dhoni and his men could never recover from Tyagis three-wicket burst early in the innings, which set the tone of the match. The first ball of the match saw Tyagi castling Naman Ojha, and his third trapped Suresh Kumar in front as India Blue were reduced to none for two.         
	Dhoni surprisingly sent Harbhajan Singh in at No.4, only to become Tyagis third victim. India Blue had their back against the wall at 19 for three.         
	Dhoni (23) decided to counter-attack in company of Wasim Jaffer (11), and the duo had added 30 runs to raise the hope of a revival when the Team India captain fell to R. Ashwin, and another batting collapse ensued with Munaf coming up with a four-wicket burst.         
	The lanky pacer removed Jaffer and Yusuf Pathan (0) in the same over, and returned to get rid of Abhishek Nayar (7) and Sreesanth (2) in successive overs to reduce India Blue to 74 for eight.         
	Ishant then polished off the tail, claiming the last two wickets. Only three Indian Blue batsmen managed double digit figures.         
	Chasing a meagre target, India Red got off to a sound start with Shikhar Dhawan (38) and Murali Vijay (12) adding 40 runs, before losing two quick wickets without adding a single run.         
	Harbhajan trapped Vijay inf front, and then had the Sunny Sohal before removing Dhawan. But it was not enough to change the fate of the match.           (PTI)

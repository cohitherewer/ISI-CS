                                                   Will be missing Viru: Gambhir
                      
	Johannesburg: Back in the national team after missing the tri-series in Sri Lanka, Indias opener Gautam Gambhir said his partner Virender Sehwags absence will play in his mind but he would take the onus to anchor his team in the Champions Trophy.         
	He (Sehwag) is a legend of the game and surely you will miss him. We have a tremendous rapport, both on and off the field, Gambhir said about his Delhi teammate Sehwag, who is recovering from a shoulder injury.         
	It (Sehwags absence) does play on your mind. When he is around, he is so destructive that he allows you to be yourself But when he is not around, you try to take up the responsibility from both ends, he added.         
	However, statistics shows Gambhir is not his usual self when Sehwag is not at the other end.         
	In the Twenty20 World Cup this June, where Sehwag was out of fray, Gambhir could only manage 148 runs from five innings.         
	In Sehwags absence, Gambhir is expected to open the innings with batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar and the Delhi left-hander said he is excited to play along side the legend.         
	What I watched of Sachin in the triangular series final against Sri Lanka, it was nothing less than awesome, he said. (PTI)

	Doha: Defending champion Andy Murray maintained his hold over Roger Federer to move into the final of the Qatar Open with a 6-7, 6-2, 6-2 win on Friday.         
	The British third seed frustrated Federer with his tactical nous from the baseline to chalk up his fifth win in six matches against the 13-times Grand Slam champion.         
	Murray will be hoping to retain his title when he takes on American Andy Roddick in the final.The world No.4 earned the sole break point of the opening set but could only watch from the baseline as Federer conjured up a screeching forehand winner to avert the danger.         
	The Swiss, who will be seeking to win a record-equalling 14th Grand Slam crown at the Australian Open later this month, let slip a 4-1 lead in the tiebreak and had to save a set point at 5-6 with a delicate backhand volley.         
	Earlier Roddick overcame Frenchman Gael Monfils 7-6, 3-6, 6-3 to reach the final.           (REUTERS)

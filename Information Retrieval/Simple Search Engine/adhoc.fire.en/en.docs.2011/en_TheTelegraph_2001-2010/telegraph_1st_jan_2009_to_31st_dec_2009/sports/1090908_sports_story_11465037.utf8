The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan likely to skip meeting
                                                   Bagan likely to skip meeting
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The stalemate in the Bhiachung Bhutia-Mohun Bagan row is set to get dragged on as Bagan officials are unlikely to attend Tuesdays meeting with arbitrator Amarendra Sharan in the capital.         
	Sharan, a former Additional Solicitor General of India, was appointed as arbitrator by the All India Football Federation to bring an end to the row, which has kept the Indian captain out of club football.         
	Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra cited their IFA Shield semi-final engagement on Wednesday as the reason for their likely absence from the meeting. We havent decided as to whether we would attend the meeting. We have the Shield semi-final match (vs Chirag United) on Wednesday and so we are concentrating on that. Lets see We will take a decision tomorrow (Tuesday), Mitra said.         
	Bhaichung, though, will present his case before the arbitrator on Tuesday.         
	Ruing the fact that he is still out of action in club football this season, Bhaichung said: I will definitely request the authorities to find a solution to the matter as soon as possible That will be better for me as I will be able to resume my club career.         
	I have already said my side of the story and will be repeating it before the arbitrator.         
	I dont know who is coming or who is not, but I will be there to meet the arbitrator, he added.

                                                   Was my day, says a beaming Chidi
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Edeh Chidi is back to the four and how! Till the other day he was being ridiculed for his profligacy but on Sunday he was basking in glory.         
	The Salt Lake Stadium was reverberating with his name, the fans chanting Chidi Chidi. And why not? Four goals against East Bengal is no joke and the Nigerian had done just that. In the Bagan dressing room, Chidi was the cynosure. There was the usual jostling to get a vantage point but Chidi was not complaining. Questions came thick and fast and the man of the moment was answering them all.         
	This is the best match of my career. For the first time in my life I have scored four goals and that too against East Bengal in a match of this stature, Chidi said. I was never under pressure for not getting goals. I knew I will get them and I will get them today.         
	Chidi confessed he was not aware of the three-decade old five-goal humiliation and the history that surrounded it. I did not know. But now I think I have made history, he said laughing.         
	Chidi rated his first goal as the best of the four. That was the pick of the lot. That gave the confidence and, after that, I never looked back. Even at half-time when the score was 3-3 we knew we would do it. I told (Jose Ramirez) Barreto about that and he also said Bagan would win.         
	When I scored my third I knew the fourth one also was coming. Its amazing but believe me I had a feeling it was my day and nothing could go wrong.         
	Dedicating this win to his wife (Adoco) and mother (Justine)  they are in town and were watching the match on television  millions of fans, my teammates and of course coach (Karim Bencharifa).         
	Coach was very supportive. Even when I was not getting the goals he was there with me. Giving me the strength to work harder. And look, today I am the hero.         
	True, four goals in a match against East Bengal doesnt happen too often. He is the first one in fact. And surely 34 years down the line if someone comes and equals this feat, Chidi will be asked to write a looking back copy. And then if he says those were the best days of my life none will complain.

                                          Abu Dhabi willing to host Cup matches
    Islamabad: Abu Dhabi cricket authorities are willing to host Pakistan rsquo;s share of World Cup 2011 matches.
    The International Cricket Council (ICC) stripped Pakistan as a host on security grounds, forcing the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to seek an alternative venue if it wants to collect its share of the hosting rights money. ldquo;If asked (by the PCB), we are willing to organise all its international matches including the World Cup, rdquo; Abu Dhabi Cricket Council rsquo;s chief executive Dilawar Mani said Saturday.
    Incidentally, Abu Dhabi held three ODIs between Australia and Pakistan earlier this month.
    Shoaib to lead
    Islamabad: Pakistan rsquo;s speedster Shoaib Akhtar will lead the Islamabad Leopards in the domestic Twenty20 Cup, just three days after his country cut him from the World 
    Twenty20 squad due to a skin infection. 
    ldquo;He (Akhtar) has told us that he is fit so we have no reason to drop him, rdquo; Islamabad Cricket Association president Shakil Shaikh said. 
    BCCI meet
    Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) organised inaugural edition of the Inter-Zonal Academy Late Hanumant Singh Trophy will get underway on Monday in Bangalore. With seven teams participating, the objective of the meet, will be to pick the best 30 cricketers for the National Cricket Academy (NCA) under-16 camp, scheduled to be held in Bangalore in July-August. 
    CAB ground
    Calcutta: The CAB acquired their third ground on Saturday after signing a MoU with Kalyani University (KU). Besides Eden Gardens and Jadavpur University rsquo;s Salt Lake campus ground, the CAB will henceforth be using the KU ground for the state league and Ranji Trophy matches. CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya said that the association would look after the preparation and maintenance of the 8.4-acre ground at their own cost. Dalmiya also revealed that the CAB had plans of acquiring another ground at Kalyani, where they intend to build an academy.
    P. Sen plan
    Calcutta: The P. Sen Trophy will see minor changes this season. The district champions of the state will also participate from this year in the 11-team knockout tournament. The tournament, which was earlier a Twenty20 event, will be played in the 50-over format. North 24-Parganas are the district champions.

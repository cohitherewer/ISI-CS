  - 1st Asian Tour title for Indian             Gaganjeet Bhullar with the trophy in Jakarta on Sunday. (AFP)                           
	Jakarta: A flawless final round did the trick as Gaganjeet Bhullar became the latest Indian with an Asian Tour title under his belt lifting the Indonesia President Invitational title on Sunday.         
	Last weeks British Open experience seemed to have done a world of good for the 21-year-old Kapurthala golfer whose final round of five-under 67 not only earned him his maiden Asian Tour title but also made up for the heartbreak of finishing runner-up in the event two years ago.         
	Bhullars four-day total of 22-under was two shots clear of Australias Adam Blyth, who shot a 68 for the lone second place at Damai Indah Golf  Bumi Serpong Damai course.         
	Bhullar also pocketed $63,400 cheque for his exploits.         
	Ive got no words to describe how happy I am, said Bhullar, who was pipped by Filipino Juvic Pagunsans birdie-eagle finish in 2007.         
	Ive been waiting for this for the past two years and I played really well today and I had a very good finish with a good score, he added.         
	Bhullar, who dropped only one bogey all week, took a one-shot lead into the last round after the third round was completed this morning. The supremely talented golfer got out from the blocks superbly with four birdies in his opening six holes and made the turn with a healthy four-shot lead.         
	Playing in the fifth to last group after organisers maintained the third round pairings due to delays caused by inclement weather, Bhullar nailed his fifth and final birdie on the par five 13th hole before enduring an anxious wait at the clubhouse.         
	Blyth, playing in the last match, fought gallantly in his attempt for a maiden Asian Tour title but failed to catch the winner, making a two-putt birdie at the last to secure lone second place.         
	I was sitting in the clubhouse and I knew what happened to me two years back. Adam played really well but it is a relief now. Ive won three times on the Indian circuit this year and my goal a few months back was to win on the Asian Tour and this will get me into all the co-sanctioned events now and give me a lot of confidence in my coming years, Bhullar said.         
	Definitely after this victory, many things are going to change in my life. Im looking forward to it, said Bhullar, who received his trophy from Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.         
	Among other Indians in the fray, Rahul Gangjee finished tied 25th, ahead of Amandeep Johl (tied 35th) and Anirban Lahiri (tied 47th). (PTI)

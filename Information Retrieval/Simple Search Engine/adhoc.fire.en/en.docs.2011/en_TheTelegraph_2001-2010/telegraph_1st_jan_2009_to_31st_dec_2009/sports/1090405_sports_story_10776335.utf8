The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB claims tour bounty
                                                   PCB claims tour bounty
                      
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Saturday hailed New Zealands proposal to host part of the scheduled Pakistan tour but made it clear that they would like to retain all earnings from the series.         
	PCB chief operating officer Saleem Altaf said New Zealand cricket boards proposal would be discussed during the ICCs executive board meeting in Dubai on April 16.         
	But we have to be sure that New Zealand consider it as our home series where we get to keep the television rights money and sponsorship earnings, Altaf said.         
	New Zealand have virtually ruled out sending their team to Pakistan because of the security situation and instead proposed that they can host some of the matches. (PTI)

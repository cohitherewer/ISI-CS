The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I want to keep it simple: Pragyan 
                                                                                                                       7                                      I want to keep it simple: Pragyan 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Pragyan Ojha is keeping fingers crossed.         
	The reasons for Ojhas caution, who got four wickets in his debut Test in Kanpur, are not that difficult to understand. Amit Mishra, the spinner whom he replaced, had a more spectacular first Test, claiming a match haul of seven for 106 in Indias mammoth 320-run win over Australia in Mohali just over an year ago.         
	Six Tests later, Mishra is not an automatic choice in the playing XI.         
	I want to keep things simple and do whatever job the captain and the team asks me to do. I dont want to put pressure on myself by worrying about whats going to happen or what has happened, Ojha told The Telegraph, when asked what lessons he can take from Mishra, on Sunday.         
	Of course, the 23-year-old left-arm spinner is enjoying being part of Indias 100th Test win. Obviously its a great feeling. It was my debut and we recorded our 100th win. I couldnt have asked for more, he said.         
	I was a bit nervous initially  Harbhajan Singh and VVS Laxman, and everyone for that matter, spoke to me and made me feel comfortable.         
	Ojha, who has played in nine ODIs and taken 12 wickets at 28.00 so far, didnt want to get ahead of himself by thinking about his prospects of playing in the third and final Test starting on Wednesday.         
	I am just trying to keep my basics right. I want to be spot on, he said.         
	Mishra, on the other hand, tried to keep his chin up despite being omitted for the Kanpur Test and found positives from his performance in the first Test.         
	In Ahmedabad, the wicket was flat. Even Murali (Muttiah Muralitharan) bowled long spells without many wickets. I tried and bowled my best.         
	I had a good economy rate (3.50, second only to Zaheer Khans 3.02 among the Indians), he said.         
	One factor that might have hindered Mishras development as a world class spinner was the fact that India have not played many Tests in recent times and he has not been able to break into the ODI playing XI. But Mishra didnt want to give any excuse.         
	The 27-year-old has played at the Brabourne, which is hosting a Test after a gap of 36 years, at the junior level eight-nine years ago and his thoughts seemed to brighten up at the mention of the venue.         
	The pitches in Mumbai have always been good. There is help for bowlers who are prepared to put in the effort and also for the batsmen. Its an even wicket, he said.

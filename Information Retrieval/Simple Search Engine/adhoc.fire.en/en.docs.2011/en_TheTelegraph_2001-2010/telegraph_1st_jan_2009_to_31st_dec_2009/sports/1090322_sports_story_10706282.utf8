            A STAFF REPORTER              Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali and striker Suraj Mondal after a practice session at the club ground on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                            
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting will play their last home match in the I-League against fifth-placed Mumbai FC on Sunday at the Barasat Stadium, hoping to notch up full three points to allow themselves breathing space.         
	The Calcutta club is reeling at the 11th spot with 19 points from the same number of matches, one more than 10th-placed Air India. Vasco SC, with 10 points from 18 matches, are sure to be relegated.         
	The black and white brigade can take heart from the fact that they havent lost in the I-League in their last four matches. They have managed draws against East Bengal, Mahindra United and United SC and defeated Vasco 1-0, away from home.         
	Mohammedan Sportings performance in the second phase of the I-League has gone up a few notches. In fact, coach Shabbir Ali also said as much after the teams practice at the club ground on Saturday.         
	Our performance in the first phase was not good. But the boys are playing well in the second phase. They are putting in a lot of effort, Shabbir said.         
	The goals are coming lately. Thats heartening. Were also managing to hold the ball a lot more during the game. The advent of Suraj Mondal has changed a lot at the top.         
	The coach also said in unambiguous terms that it would be trouble for the club again if they lose on Sunday. Mumbai FC, coached by the British coach David Booth, had blanked Mohammedan Sporting 3-0 in the first leg.         
	We have to win to be safe. Thats what I am telling the boys. Its our last home match. We have to do something.         
	Out last two matches are against Dempo and Churchill. Its going to be difficult. If we dont win tomorrow, its going to be trouble again.         
	The home team will miss defender Gurpreet Singh, due to a double yellow.         
	The Mumbai side were unhappy with the arrangements provided to them at the Rabindra Sarobar stadium for afternoon practice on Saturday, and chose the Sports Authority of India, Salt Lake ground instead.         
	We were told late yesterday night that the Rabindra Sarobar stadium has been allotted to us and that only half of the ground is available, due to a pre-scheduled function, a Mumbai FC official said.         
	Were not a Kabbadi team that well practice in half the ground and decided against practising at the venue. We took a risk of going to SAI and thankfully that risk paid off as we managed some decent practice.         
	The Mumbai team have no injury worries or card problems in Sundays match.

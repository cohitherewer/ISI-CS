	Calcutta: Icon Imran Khan, who underwent emergency surgery for an intestinal blockage on Monday afternoon, regained consciousness late in the evening.         
	By the grace of God, Imran is on the mend He was under sedation for many hours, but came out of it without too much discomfort and is sleeping now, Imrans closest friend told The Telegraph around 10.45pm from the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital.         
	The hospital, it may be recalled, has been built by Pakistans World Cup-winning captain himself in memory of his mother.         
	If all continues to go well, then Imran should be out within a maximum of a couple of days Weve been touched by the calls made by well-wishers from across the world, the close friend added.         
	Agencies add from Lahore: A spokesman for Imrans Tehreek-e-Insaaf party said he had complained of severe stomach pain after regular exercises at his residence on Monday morning.         
	He suffered cramps in the small intestine during the exercises and was taken to the hospital where the doctors decided on immediate surgery, he said.         
	Post surgery, the 56-year-old cricketer-turned-politician was shifted to a private room and has been advised three-four days rest.         
	Imran was to have addressed a public meeting later in the day.         
	Dr Aamer did the surgery and he is satisfied that Imran is out of danger and his condition now is stable. It was a minor problem, the spokesman added.         
	Former captains Wasim Akram, Inzamam-ul Haq and leading political figures rang the hospital to inquire about Imrans health.         
	Ex-wife Jemima and his two sons, who are based in the UK, also called Imran to wish him a speedy recovery.         
	As part of a hectic schedule, Imran had addressed five public meetings in different parts of Lahore on Sunday.         
	Imran, as a mark of protest, didnt contest the last elections but he did successfully fight in the 2002 polls and was a Member of the National Assembly for five years.

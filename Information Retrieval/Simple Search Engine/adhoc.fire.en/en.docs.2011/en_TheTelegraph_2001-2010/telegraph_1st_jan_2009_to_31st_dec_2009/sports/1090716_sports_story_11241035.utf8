  - British Open - Ireland rsquo;s Padraig Harrington to go after third straight title, at Turnberry

	Turnberry (Scotland): The sea breeze in his face was not nearly as important to Tiger Woods as finding the best route around three pot bunkers on the 10th hole at Turnberry.         
	He aimed his tee shot to the right, on the high side of two bunkers, then pulled his 3-wood just enough that the ball bounded along the links until it stopped rolling just three yards short of the sand.         
	This was OK.         
	Thats the whole idea, Woods said. Some of these holes sucker you into trying to take it over the bunkers.         
	A bold tee shot would leave a shorter approach into the green, perhaps a greater chance at birdie.         
	But can you do that over four days? Woods replied. He doesnt appear willing to take that chance.         
	Woods has captured the British Open three times on two links courses.         
	He won his first claret jug at St Andrews in 2000, a victory as much famous for his career Grand Slam as his four rounds without once playing out of the bunker.         
	His most recent victory was three years ago at Hoylake, where Woods hit driver only one time in 72 holes.         
	He chose that week to play mainly long irons and the occasional 3-wood off the tee, anything to keep him short of the bunkers. I dont think Ive ever been able to reach the green from a bunker, Woods said. Its a one-shot penalty. Even if you can advance it 60 yards, you still have a 6-iron left to the green.                   
	Turnberry is a far different venue. The strategy is no different.         
	Woods makes his return to the British Open, missing golfs oldest championship last year while in the early stages of recovering from knee surgery that kept him out for eight months.         
	He had never seen Turnberry until arriving Sunday, and he played the last of his three practice rounds Tuesday morning beneath a mixture of clouds and sunshine, fickle weather that likely will continue for the week.         
	Three days should be enough time to cram for this test, just as it was for Hoylake. What he has learned, as has the rest of the players who were not at Turnberry in 1994 when it last hosted the British Open, is that it is more important that ever to keep the ball in play.         
	Beyond the fairways is grass so thick that it might be difficult to get it back into play, if it can be found.         
	Even so, the bunkers are what stand out as the threat. Masters champion Angel Cabrera is among the big hitters in golf, and he spoke of caution.         
	I think Im going to be playing short of the bunkers pretty much all week, Cabrera said. That will be my strategy.         
	They are not alone.         
	Padraig Harrington will be going after a third straight British Open  no one has done that since Peter Thomson in 1954-56  and he tuned up for Turnberry the way he did his previous two victories, by playing links golf in Ireland and winning the Irish PGA.         
	Harrington is no stranger to this brand of golf, and he says theres no secret to succeeding.         
	My whole links golfing life, Ive avoided the bunkers at all costs, he said.         
	Bunkers are like water hazards on a links course. Youre chipping out. Avoid at all costs.         
	Woods remains without a major since his return from reconstructive surgery  the first time since 2004 he doesnt have one in his possession  yet is pleased with how far he has come in the five months he has been back.         
	His victory two weeks ago at his AT amp;T National was his third this year, more than anyone else on the PGA Tour, as many as anyone in the world this year.         
	I remember looking at the year just trying to get back playing, he said.         
	Hopefully, I can play. And hopefully, I can play at a high level. And to sit here and say I was going to have three wins halfway through the year ... if anyone would have looked at my situation, they would have said, You probably might be reaching a little bit.         
	Granted, I havent won a major, he said. But Ive come close. Ive put myself in position to win the first few, I just havent done it.         
	Meanwhile, British bookmakers have listed Rory McIlroy as the third favourite, unusual for someone playing in his first British Open as a pro. Stranger still is that he doesnt seem fazed, perhaps because his age (20) matches the odds (20-1).         
	McIlroy already has shown in small doses that he is capable. He comes from Holywood  a coastal town in Northern Ireland, not to be confused with the glitz of LA  and already is easily recognised by his freckles and curly brown hair that tumbles out of his cap and over his ears.         
	On a surprisingly sun-splashed day along the Ayrshire Coast, McIlroy found a flat part of the putting green Wednesday, and his caddie marked off 8 feet with a chalk line.         
	The kid rapped three balls at a time, stopping to chat, constantly smiling, not really paying attention.         
	He made 105 putts in a row, seemed to lose interest, then moved on to another hole 30 feet away.         
	One reason he is getting so much attention, is constant search for someone to challenge Woods.         
	Even at golfs oldest championship, the focus turns to youth. (AP)               
	McIlroy will be playing the first two rounds with 24-year-old Anthony Kim, who is No. 15 in the world and an explosive talent. Martin Kaymer, the 24-year-old German, is coming off consecutive victories on the European Tour and can became the first player since Seve Ballesteros in 1986 to make it three in a row.         
	Among the quot;older set quot; are 29-year-old Sergio Garcia and Adam Scott, who turns 29 on Thursday.

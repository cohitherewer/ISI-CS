The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Getting Sachin, Sanath out early is the key
                                                   Getting Sachin, Sanath out early is the key
                      
	The rain seems to keep following the Knight Riders since the IPLs kick-off. I dont think there has been one game where we have not faced heavy showers. Its getting colder and windier in South Africa as the winter is setting in and a few more teams will face this situation as the tournament progresses.         
	We have come to Port Elizabeth which is one of the most beautiful cities in South Africa. Its bang next to the sea and it has a cricket ground which is famous for the band that plays right throughout from the stands. I have been to Port Elizabeth a number of times with the Indian team and the place seems to get better and better.         
	The wicket here is also one of the flattest in the country as the one-day series between Australia and South Africa showed. This pitch will provide some assistance to the spinners as some of the pitches in South Africa are doing now, it being the fag end of their season. This is one of the reasons why we have got Ajantha Mendis in the squad and I am sure he will have an important role to play in the matches to come.         
	We play the Mumbai Indians Monday. In the first phase of the tournament not many teams have gone ahead and the way Twenty20 cricket goes, any team could beat the other on its day. As a team, we are really disappointed with the result of the game against the Rajasthan Royals, a game we should have won easily. But we need to put this behind and focus on Mondays game. The Mumbai Indians are a pretty balanced team with their strength lying in the top order in the form of Sachin Tendulkar and Sanath Jayasuriya. If we can get them early, we would have gone a long way towards winning the game. It will not be easy for players like JP Duminy and Dwayne Bravo to play Mendis for the first time. Sachin has been in good form and I am sure the Knight Riders would love to see him make an early exit in Mondays game.         
	The Mumbai Indians have a good bowling attack in Zaheer Khan, Lasith Malinga, Bravo and Harbhajan Singh. Especially Malinga, who looks to be in good form after his comeback from a long injury break and is bowling with a lot of variation. Zaheer has had an outstanding year in Test cricket and although he might be a bit tired with the amount of cricket he has played, he will still be a major force to reckon with.         
	Port Elizabeth is a very windy city and hence there will be some swing for the seamers with the white new ball, but there will be assistance for the spinners as well. We have played well after a poor start against the Deccan Chargers and hopefully we will be able to carry our form in Mondays game as well. Our form with the bat will be the key and some of the big names we have in the squad will have to stand up in this crucial game. Two points for either team will be very handy because nobody wants to fall far behind the rest.         
	For us, the happiest bit is that we have seen some sunshine today (Sunday) and hopefully it will stay till Monday and also for the rest of the tournament.           PROFESSIONAL MANAGEMENT GROUP

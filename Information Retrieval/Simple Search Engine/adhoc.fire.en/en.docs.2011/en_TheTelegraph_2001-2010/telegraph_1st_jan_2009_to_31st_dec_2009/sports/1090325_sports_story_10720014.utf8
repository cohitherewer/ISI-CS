The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Armstrong breaks collar-bone in race
                                                   Armstrong breaks collar-bone in race
                      
	Madrid: Seven-times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong fractured his right collar-bone in a race in Spain on Monday, but Astana team manager Johan Bruyneel is confident that the broken collar-bone will not prevent him from riding in either the Giro dItalia or Tour de France, though he isnt likely to be a contender for the title in the Italian classic.         
	Armstrong fractured his collar-bone after crashing in the first stage of the Vuelta of Castilla and Leon race in northern Spain. The seven-time Tour champion stayed in Bruyneels house in Madrid on Monday night before flying out Tuesday to Austin, Texas, for possible surgery.         
	I dont think this changes anything for the Tour de France, Bruyneel said Tuesday. A broken collar-bone in the month of March does not at all compromise the start of the Tour de France or your performance in the Tour de France.         
	The Tour runs from July 4-26, but the 37-year-old American had also planned to ride in the Giro for the first time from May 9-31.         
	Bruyneel said the team was not ruling out the Giro at all. Being at the start of the Giro is no problem, Bruyneel said.         
	But he has to have at least a decent level to be in the race and to compete at a certain level. ... Now its almost clear that hes not going to be able to be a contender but we just have to change our focus and try to do the Giro, if he can get to the start, with another mentality.         
	Bruyneel said Armstrong would see a specialist in Austin as soon as possible.         
	Armstrong was riding in only his second race in Europe since returning from a retirement that lasted three and a half years. Last week, he finished 125th in the Milan-San Remo cycling classic, more than eight minutes behind winner Mark Cavendish.

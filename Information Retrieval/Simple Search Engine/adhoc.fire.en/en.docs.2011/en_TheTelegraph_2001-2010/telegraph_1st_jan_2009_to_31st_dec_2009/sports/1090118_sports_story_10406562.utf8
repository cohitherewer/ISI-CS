The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Somdev needs to put on weight

	The era of high fives and Paes-Bhupathi chest bumps at the Chennai Open is over. It left a hopeless scene of Indian success. In 2009, 23-year-old Somdev Dev Varman, ranked 202, struck like a bolt from the blue and swept aside higher-ranked players all the way to the final.         
	Among the scalps was seasoned Carlos Moya, ranked 45, a former world No. 1 and French Open Champion, and the giant 610 Croat Ivo Karlovic, ranked 25. Somdevs spectacular run came to an end in the final against the 66 Croat Cilic.         
	When the never say die Somdev, a set down and 5-2 in the second, fought back taking advantage of a nervous Cilic wobble, taking it to a tie-breaker, the ecstatic crowd went berserk.         
	But Cilic pulled up his socks and managed to come through. Had Cilic lost the second set, I would have fancied Somdevs chances in the decider. But Somdev achieved enough to have Vijay Amritraj comparing him to Michael Chang who many years ago won the French Open.         
	We all got carried away by Somdevs performance. At long last, Indian tennis, sliding into oblivion, had found a saviour. It sent the media into hyper-ventilating mode. Ramanathan Krishnan, the wise icon of Indian tennis, brought us all down to earth by saying that Somdev has had one good week, he has 51 more to go.         
	Somdevs meteoric start in 2009 has taken him from 200 to 154 in the ATP rankings. The 200 to 100 in the rankings is dog-eat-dog territory. They are all strong, talented, very hungry and ready to kill or die for a match. To measure up and get past them, Somdev needs to be fitter, stronger and mentally tougher.         
	Since when I saw him last during the Davis Cup in Delhi in March, Somdev has improved a lot. He has improved his fitness, strength and service, but still has a long way to go to reach the top-most level. However, he seems to be on the right track. His placement and variation of service has improved considerably. He served 10 aces in the match against Moya.         
	But an additional 10 kph added to service power would make things easier for him. He had to work very hard to retrieve the angles Cilic made off his short returns. In spite of Somdevs great mobility, Cilic was able to hit 26 winners.         
	If Somdev could have hit his shots a couple of yards deeper, the complexion of the match would have changed. Throughout the tournament, Somdev showed great resolve and mental toughness, qualities which will stand him in good stead in the years to come.         
	To sum up, Somdev needs to get more muscle on his body to increase the all-round power in his game and develop a winning shot. It can certainly be done. I remember Agassi who went from lean to an extra 8lbs of muscle in one year between Wimbledons. The 51 weeks ahead are fraught with unavoidable pitfalls which will be a searching tortuous test for Somdev.         
	Whether Somdev makes it or not, his contribution to Indian tennis is valuable. His behaviour was exemplary. No arguments, swear words, racket abuse, duels with the umpire but a silent searing focus could be seen in his eyes.         
	More significantly, his style of play, his willingness to fight and grind it out from the baseline will influence the style of play of our aspiring youngsters and wean them away from flashy premature slashes at the ball. The impatience, reluctance and inability to grind out the points have been the endemic weakness in the Indian style of play.         
	It is an insurmountable obstacle towards achieving higher rankings. Hopefully, our youngsters will imbibe of his sterling qualities. Somdev is a perfect role model.

                                                     Few takers for plan
            OUR BUREAU            Sukhwinder                           
	Calcutta/ New Delhi: The All India Football Federations (AIFF) proposed plan to select 25 leading players and reserve them exclusively for the national team till the Asia Cup in January 2011 evoked mixed reactions from the top clubs on Monday.         
	Mohun Bagan general secretary Anjan Mitra ridiculed the proposed plan and said such a plan could never be implemented. Its ridiculous. The AIFF cant manage five players, how are they going to handle 25? he asked.         
	Mitra said if the national players are barred from playing club football, it will have far-reaching impact. The sponsors will have a second thought and the crowd will stop flocking the stadium, he told The Telegraph.         
	East Bengals UB representative Amit Sen said that the plan was not financially feasible. I have my doubts on their fund-raising abilities, Sen did not mince any words. Meanwhile, JCT coach Sukhwinder Singh felt that the federation should have consulted the clubs before taking such an important decision but his Mahindra United counterpart, Derek Pereira said he was ready to release his players.         
	As a former national coach, I am aware how important it is to get the players together for a longer period for the success of the national team, Sukhwinder said.         
	Dempo coach Armando Colaco was doubtful whether the plan would do any good to Indian football. My team will be badly affected, said a worried Armando.         
	Mahindra coach Derek Pereira was the only one who supported the move. I know my team will be badly affected. But I am ready to sacrifice it for the sake of Indian football.

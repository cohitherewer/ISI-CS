The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SSP makes cut; Jeev, Jyoti miss
                                                   SSP makes cut; Jeev, Jyoti miss
                      
	Glasgow: A late slump notwithstanding, SSP Chowrasia managed to make the cut for the weekend action but it was curtains for other three Indians in fray after the second round of the Barclays Scottish Open golf meet.         
	While Jeev Milkha Singh (75) and Jyoti Randhawa (70) failed to be inside the cutline that was set at three-over, Shiv Kapur retired after nine holes.         
	Chowrasia was third from bottom at 75th, on the leaderboard with a total of two-over 142. He picked up birdies on the third, seventh and the ninth holes to complete a blemish-free front-nine at three-under.         
	In the backward journey, however, he dropped three bogeys against an equal number of birdies to round off a mixed day. (PTI)

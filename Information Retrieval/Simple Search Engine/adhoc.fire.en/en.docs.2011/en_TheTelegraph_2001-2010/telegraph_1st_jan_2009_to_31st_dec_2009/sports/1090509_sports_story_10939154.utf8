The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Captain the boss on field: Steve
                                                   Captain the boss on field: Steve
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former Australia captain Steve Waugh feels that coaches should follow the example of Team India coach Gary Kirsten who produces results and yet keeps out of the limelight.         
	According to the 43-year old Waugh, a captain is definitely the overall boss on the field and therefore a coach should render him all the support without coming to the forefront.         
	On the field, it is definitely the captain who is the boss. Thats the way it has been all these years. A coach too has a definite role but it ought to be probably played out the way (Gary) Kirsten is doing for the Indian side. He is never too much in the forefront and yet he is getting the job done, Waugh said on the sidelines of a cricket clinic in the city on Friday.         
	Backing India to defend their title in the ensuing International Cricket Council (ICC) World T20 in England in June, Waugh said: Indians have a very good side... The youngsters are really impressive and the IPL has done a world of good to them. They have a good chance this time too But the Australians too have a strong chance.         
	Talking about the secret of Australias success during his era, Waugh said: Even when you are at the top you should not be complacent You should remember that one could easily slip from the top spot. One has to take pride in performing for the country and egg each other on to sustain that performance.         
	Asked how long he felt Sachin Tendulkar would continue playing the game, Waugh said: Oh, I suppose, he could go on till 50 the way he is going (laughs). But seriously, its up to him really to decide how long he would continue. One can only say that he is getting better all the time.

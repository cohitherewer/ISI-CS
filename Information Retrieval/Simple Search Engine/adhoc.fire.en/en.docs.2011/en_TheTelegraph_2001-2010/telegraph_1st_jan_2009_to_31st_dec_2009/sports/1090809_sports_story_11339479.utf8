The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England stare at a huge loss
                                                   England stare at a huge loss
  - Hosts trail by 261 with 5 wkts in hand                             
	Leeds: Australia inflicted a dramatic England collapse for the second time in the match as they eyed a victory in the fourth Ashes Test at Headingley.         
	England collapsed to 82 for five in their second innings on Saturday. Australia may win the Test well inside three days which would help them draw level at 1-1 in the five-match series.         
	Marcus Norths patient century guided Australia to a commanding total of 445 on the second day and Ben Hilfenhaus and Mitchell Johnson claimed five wickets in 44 balls to leave Englands hopes in tatters.         
	England trail by 261 runs and Australia should wrap up victory and level the series with ease on Sunday.         
	Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook shared an opening stand of 58 for England but the former was leg before to Hilfenhaus for 32, Ravi Bopara fell first ball and Johnson removed Ian Bell, Paul Collingwood and Cook.         
	Nightwatchman James Anderson was unbeaten on nought at the close with Matt Prior, dropped off the last ball of the day, on 4.         
	Resuming on 196 for four, Australias middle- and lower-order had all the time in the world to accentuate Englands humiliation.         
	North and Michael Clarke compiled a fifth-wicket partnership of 152 in the morning session to turn the screw on England who were bowled out for 102 on Friday and again looked laboured in the field.         
	Clarkes fourth half-century of the series was brought up from 78 balls with a tuck off the hips from Harmison, and thereafter he went into overdrive, particularly against the labouring Anderson, whom he belted on the up, through the covers, twice in four balls, before working him sublimely through the leg-side from consecutive deliveries.         
	North greeted Broad by clipping a first-ball half-volley through mid-wicket for four, as the pair brought up their hundred partnership from 152 balls  their third in six innings this series.         
	Graham Onions trapped Clarke in front for 93 just before the interval but the batsmen had picked off boundaries at will and experienced few problems against such a lacklustre attack.         
	North received useful support from the lower order and he reached his third century in six Tests with a huge slog sweep for six off spinner Graeme Swann before raising his bat to the balcony and kissing his helmet.         
	Brad Haddin fell to the second new ball for 14 but Johnson struck a few lusty blows in his 27 and Stuart Clark launched a blistering attack with three sixes in a rapid 32.         
	He became Stuart Broads fifth victim, however, and the England seamer had North caught on the mid-wicket boundary by Anderson to complete Test-best figures of six for 91.         
	North batted 326 minutes and hit a six and 13 fours in his second century of the series.         
	Strauss and Cook started confidently and played some nicely-timed strokes with no hint of the drama to come.         
	But Hilfenhaus was recalled for his second spell and he trapped Strauss and Bopara leg before with successive balls.         
	Bell just survived the hattrick but he soon nicked a Johnson outswinger to Ricky Ponting at second slip and the left-arm seamer snared Collingwood in front of the stumps.         
	Cook edged Johnson to wicketkeeper Haddin for 30 and England had lost five wickets for the addition of just 20 runs.(Reuters)

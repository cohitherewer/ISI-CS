The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wrong to use fatigue as an excuse: Smith
                                                   Wrong to use fatigue as an excuse: Smith
                      
	Graeme Smith, the South Africa captain, also spoke to the media at Trent Bridge. Later, he briefly talked to The Telegraph separately.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Having successfully defended a moderate total (130 for five)         
	Cant say its our best win in the tournament as weve had different challenges, but its good to beat India.         
	The team hed probably been apprehensive about on the eve of the World T20         
	In terms of talent, India was right at the top...         
	Fatigue being cited as a top reason for Indias debacle         
	As professional sportsmen, it would be wrong to use fatigue as an excuse... Our team, for example, arrived knowing what to expect and weve given ourselves one last push, knowing there will be a break after this tournament. Weve been playing a lot of cricket for the past two years or so and players have to be managed.         
	Wicket having been on the slower side         
	It was a subcontinental type...         
	The possibility of a dream final  clinical South Africa versus flamboyant Sri Lanka         
	That could happen, though its not that my team doesnt have flair... We have that and the players innovate.         
	What has made the difference for South Africa         
	The players ability and the roles theyve been playing.         
	Role played by him         
	My style is to open the minds of the players and to move towards the next level...         
	Challenge faced by him in the World T20         
	To adapt tactically to the different teams.         
	If hes worried that the Trent Bridge wicket could again be slow on Thursday, in the semi-finals versus Pakistan         
	Not really... Pakistans a good team and theyll turn up believing they can beat us... Wed played them in a warm-up game, at Trent Bridge itself, and won... Well make sure that we turn up having that competitive edge... Well be looking to play to potential and, so far, the pressure has been handled well.         
	Whether the team has been conscious of being labelled favourites         
	We keep getting asked about it... The players have been aware of that, but theyve been doing the job expected of them... Youve got to treat every match as a new game.         
	Finally, if his sights already are set on Sundays final         
	(Laughs) Id love to say yes, but Thursday comes first!           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT IN LONDON

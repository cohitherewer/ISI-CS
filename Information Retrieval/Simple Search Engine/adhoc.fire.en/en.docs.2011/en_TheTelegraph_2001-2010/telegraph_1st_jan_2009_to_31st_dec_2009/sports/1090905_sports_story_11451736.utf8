The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Somdev is upbeat despite loss
                                                   Somdev is upbeat despite loss
                      
	New York: Somdev Dev Varman squandered chances galore to crash out of US Open singles even as Sania Mirza advanced in the womens doubles and mixed doubles events here on Thursday.         
	Somdev, who was trailing by two sets, staged a dramatic comeback by blanking 23rd seed German Philipp Kohlschreiber in the third set but eventually lost his second round encounter 3-6, 4-6, 6-0, 2-6 after almost a three-hour battle.         
	However in all other matches of the day, Indians came out triumphant.         
	Sania and her Italian partner Francesca Schiavone, seeded 14th, survived a scare from unseeded Ekaterina Dzehalevich of Belarus and Czech Renata Voracova before recording a 5-7, 7-5, 6-1 win to advance to the womens doubles second round (as reported in Fridays Late City edition).         
	Later Sania, teaming up with Candian Daniel Nestor, outplayed Akgul Amanmuradova of Uzbekistan and Ashley Fisher of Australia 6-3, 6-1 in the first round of the mixed doubles.         
	Defending champions Leander Paes and Cara Black of Zimbabwe overcame a unseeded pair of Swiss Patty Schnyder and South Africas Wesley Moodie 6-4, 3-6, 11-9 in the first round of mixed doubles.         
	Third seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles cruised to the mens doubles second round after scoring a comfortable 6-3, 6-4 win over American James Cerretani and Lovro Zovko of Croatia.         
	With Somdevs defeat, Indian challenge ended in the singles events. Sania is already out of singles after suffering one of the worst defeats of her career in the second round against Italian friend Flavia Pennetta.         
	Somdev, who won three qualifying matches to make it to the main draw, could convert only four of the 20 breakpoints against the experienced Kohlschreiber, who had defeated Novak Djokovic in the French Open.         
	Although he blanked Kohlschreiber in the third set to raise hopes of a great comeback, breaking him thrice, but at the same time he squandered six chances.         
	Qualifying for the US Open was a great breakthrough for me and then to win a match and take a set off Philipp and have some chances against him will give me great confidence for the future, he said after the match.         
	It was my fourth slam attempt, and the first one that I actually qualified for and thats a breakthrough in some ways, Somdev said.         
	I had chances, continued Somdev. He played better and came out and won today but I still know that I had chances and that is good.         
	It has been a great experience for me. I think I played well this last week and half. I am taking a lot of positives from the tournament.         
	More belief that I belong with the big boys and that I am on the right path. Just need to keep working hard on my game, he said.         
	The 24-year-old Somdev hopes he can be part of a resurgence in Indian tennis. Its very important to me, he said. I feel that I have a great opportunity right now coming from such a great country and such great sport traditions.         
	There are a lot of sports enthusiasts and they want you to do well. Hopefully I can take all of that energy and try and make the best of it.         
	Somdev, ranked 162, knows he has a long way to go.         
	Im trying to get better, trying to learn. Its my first season on the tour. Its a new place, its different from college. Im working hard and taking the right steps.         
	You want to improve every single thing you do. Overall Id like to get stronger, faster, hit the ball harder, serve bigger. Hopefully Ill be able to do all those things.         
	Somdev has already started thinking about the next assignment  Indias away play-off Davis Cup tie against South Africa.         
	A victory would mean that India enter the World Group after a gap of 11 long years.         
	Davis Cup is the next target. Its a big tie and I would like to win it for India, Somdev said. Sania also lost her second-round match on Wednesday but Somdev has a lot of faith in her tennis future.         
	Shes awesome, he said. Weve been friends since juniors. Shes recovering from injury, but shes a great player.                   (AGENCIES)

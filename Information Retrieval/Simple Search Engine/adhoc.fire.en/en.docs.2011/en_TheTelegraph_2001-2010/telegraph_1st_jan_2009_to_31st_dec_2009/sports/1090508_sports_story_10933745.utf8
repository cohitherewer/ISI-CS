	London: Graham Onions took five wickets on his debut Thursday as England bowled out the West Indies for 152, then reduced them to 32 for two in their second innings on the second day of the first Test.      
	The West Indies remained 186 runs behind after following 25 short of the target for avoiding the follow on, with play cut short because of bad light.      
	Onions took five for 38 in the visitors first innings, including three wickets in one over. The West Indies collapsed from 70 for one, losing their final six wickets for just 35 runs off 52 balls.      
	Spinner Graeme Swann had Brendan Nash caught by Paul Collingwood at second slip, before Onions claimed three wickets in an over.      
	After beginning his Test bowling career with a delivery that was smacked to the boundary for four by Devon Smith, Onions responded by having Lendl Simmons caught at first slip by Andrew Strauss in the sixth over. Two deliveries later, Taylor nicked a ball to wicketkeeper Matt Prior before Onions had Sulieman Benn caught by Graeme Swann on the final ball of the over.      
	The first ball of Onions seventh over then trapped Denesh Ramdin leg before wicket and Collingwood then dropped Lionel Baker in the slips.      
	The innings should have ended on 139 when both Fidel Edwards and Baker found themselves at the same end. But instead of walking to the stumps to run either man out, Swann hurled the ball at Broad, who mis-fielded, resulting in overthrows.      
	Onions joined a select group of bowlers to record a five-wicket haul on his debut when Baker was given out lbw.      
	The visitors second innings got off to a miserable start when captain Chris Gayle was dismissed without scoring. (AP)

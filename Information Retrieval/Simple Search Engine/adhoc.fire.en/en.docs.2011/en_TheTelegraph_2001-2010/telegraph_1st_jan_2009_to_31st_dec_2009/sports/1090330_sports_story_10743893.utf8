The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hidayat loses his cool
                                                   Hidayat loses his cool
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hyderabad: If Taufik Hidayat is to be believed, modern technology hampers natural game.         
	The former world and Olympic champion, who won the Yonex Sunrise Indian Open mens singles title here with a scintillating display, said after the final that the air-conditioning system in the playing hall forced him to change his style of play against the Malaysian opponent.         
	Hidayat, who defeated Muhammad Hafiz Hashim of Malaysia 21-18, 21-19 in front of a highly supportive crowd, said that the drift in the air because of the air-conditioning was disturbing.         
	The wind was a big factor, Hidayat said. The drift in the air was disturbing at times. So much so, that my smashes were going out. I couldnt control them properly, said the Indonesian, arguably the worlds best smasher of the shuttle.         
	The spectators, who were hoping to watch some of Hidayats lightning backhand smashes, were a disappointed lot as he mainly depended on his deceptive net play to tame the Malaysian.         
	Because of the drift, my smashes were travelling far, so I relied on my net game. After the first game, I even spoke to Hashim about it.         
	Hidayat said that he was surprised to see such a big crowd at the stadium.         
	It was nice. I am thankful to them for supporting me during my matches.         
	Meanwhile, the president of the Badminton Association of India (BAI), V.K. Verma, said that Jwala Gutta and Shruti Kurian would continue to play as a doubles pair for India till May.         
	After May, Jwala is likely to pair up with Ashwani Poonappa while Shruti Kurian will partner Aparna Balan.

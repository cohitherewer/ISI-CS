                                                     Vijender No. 2 in rankings
    - Akhil, Nanao Singh and Dinesh are the other Indians in top 10           A STAFF REPORTER            Vijender Kumar                                 
	Calcutta: Boxer Vijender Kumar was placed second in the 75kg category list of the International Boxing Association (AIBA)s first-ever official rankings that were announced Thursday. Apart from the Olympic bronze medallist three other Indians made the top 10 in their respective categories.         
	Vijender won bronze medals at this years European Grand Prix in Czech Republic and the Asian Championships in China and sits behind Olympic silver medallist Emilio Correa Bayeux of Cuba with 1700 points.         
	The Khel Ratna awardee had lost to Bayeux (2500 points) in the Beijing Olympics semi-finals. Vijender, however, is unlikely to collect the Khel Ratna award in person as the boxer would be leaving for Italy to participate in the World Championships, a couple of days before the high-profile function at the Rashtrapati Bhawan on August 29.         
	However, Olympic gold medallist James de Gale of England was not rated as he has turned professional.         
	All good things have happened to me over this past one year. It feels fantastic to be rated so high, Vijender said.         
	Among other Indians, Beijing Olympics quarter finalist Akhil Kumar has been placed ninth in the featherweight (57kg) rankings with 1050 points.         
	Akhil had competed in the bantamweight (54kg) division in Beijing and shifted to featherweight only this year. The Haryana boxer is yet to compete in any major international tournament since changing his division and will make his featherweight debut at the World Championships next month.         
	According to the AIBA rules, any boxer who changes weight categories will be awarded 75 per cent of all points accumulated in his previous weight category.         
	In the 48kg category, world youth champion Thokchom Nanao Singh has been ranked fifth with a tally of 1400 points.         
	In 51kg, national champion Suranjoy Singh has been ranked 14th with 800 points, while Beijing Olympics quarter finalist Jitender Kumar has been ranked 13th on the bantamweight list with a total 837.5 points.         
	Jitender competed in Beijing as a flyweight boxer but changed his division this year. He won a bronze in the Asian Championships earlier this year in the bantamweight division.         
	Olympian and Asian Championships bronze medallist Dinesh Kumar is ranked joint sixth in the 81kg category with 1050 points. The rankings were developed on the basis of the performance of the boxers in various world and continental championships over the past one year.         
	These include the 2007 AIBA World Boxing Championships, Olympic qualifying tournaments, Beijing Olympics, Youth World Championships, Pan American Championships, European Elite Championships, Asian Elite Championships, African Elite Championships.

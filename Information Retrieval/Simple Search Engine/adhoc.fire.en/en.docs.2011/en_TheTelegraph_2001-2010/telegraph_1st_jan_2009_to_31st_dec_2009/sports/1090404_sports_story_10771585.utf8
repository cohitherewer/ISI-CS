            OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT                            
	Calcutta: Apprentice jockey B. Srinivas Rao, who had a nasty fall from Glory Of North in the concluding event on Friday, the Senor Pele Handicap, had a miraculous escape. Glory Of North, apparently, clipped the heels of Big Thrillz soon after the start and was unseated. Sea Legend won the race from Big Thrillz.          
	There was a stewards enquiry into the running of the race but the fall being purely accidental, the placings were allowed to stand. The TV replays also confirmed the stewards stand. The apprentice is under observation but out of danger; said Boman Parakh, secretary RCTC, late in the evening.

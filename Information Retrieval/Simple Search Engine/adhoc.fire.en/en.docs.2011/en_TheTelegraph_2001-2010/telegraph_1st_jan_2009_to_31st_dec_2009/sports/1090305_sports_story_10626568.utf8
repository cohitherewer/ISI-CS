                                                   Unfit Patel axed
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Samit Patel was Wednesday axed from the England one-day and Twenty20 International squad for the West Indies tour.         
	Patel, 24, was informed of the decision Tuesday by performance director David Parsons.         
	Adil Rashid of Yorkshire, who has been a part of the England Test squad, will now remain with the England squad in Port of Spain for the Twenty20 against West Indies and the subsequent five one-day Internationals.         
	The decision follows Patels failure, despite repeated warnings, to reach an acceptable standard of fitness for international cricket. He will now remain with the England Lions for the concluding part of their tour of New Zealand.         
	Hugh Morris, the ECB managing director, said in a statement: Samit Patel is a talented cricketer but he, like every other player who joins the senior England team, must be aware of the strict fitness criteria that will be set.         
	Patels fitness has been monitored since he returned from India in November.

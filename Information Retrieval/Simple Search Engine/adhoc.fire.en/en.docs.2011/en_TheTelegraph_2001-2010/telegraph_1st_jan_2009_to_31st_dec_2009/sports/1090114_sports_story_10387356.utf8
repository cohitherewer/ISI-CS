                                                   Three greats to come together
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Indias only Olympic gold medallist Abhinav Bindra, world chess champion Viswanathan Anand and the countrys most successful cricket captain Sourav Ganguly will come together to felicitate the winners of the NIIT inter-college chess competition on Thursday.         
	It will be Bindras first visit to the city after his gold medal winning effort at the Beijing Olympics.         
	Anand will also be in the city for the first time after retaining his world championship title.         
	The champion defended his title against Vladimir Kramnik.         
	Anand will felicitate the winners of the chess competition in the presence of Sourav and Bindra.         
	The occasion would be a great opportunity for the citys youngsters to catch a glimpse of the three all-time greats of Indian sport together.         
	While Sourav is the son of the soil, Bindra and Anand have thousands of fans in the city. City boy Surya Sekhar Ganguly was one of the seconds who accompanied Anand when he defeated Kramnik to retain his world title in 2008.         
	Although shooting is not among the most popular sports of the city, Bindras Olympic gold was cheered by all kinds of people of the city and this visit should be a memorable one for the Chandigarh man as well.

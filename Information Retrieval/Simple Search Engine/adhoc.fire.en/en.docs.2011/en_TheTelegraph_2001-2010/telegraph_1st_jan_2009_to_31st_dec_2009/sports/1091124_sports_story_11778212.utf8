	Calcutta: Representatives of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) and the Indian Football Association (IFA) met the city police brass, including commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, Monday to discuss the row between the two associations over grounds.         
	It was decided at the meeting that the CAB will hand over the local fixture to the IFA and the latter will then have to fix the Calcutta Football League matches so that the matches didnt clash. The CABs matches are set to start from December 6.

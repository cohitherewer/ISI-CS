                                                   England steamroll India by 9 wkts
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India were let down by their batsmen as the Jhulan Goswami led team was spanked by England by nine wickets in a group league match of the ICC Womens World Cup at the North Sydney Oval on Tuesday.         
	Put into bat, India managed just 169 in 48.4 overs, a score they largely owe to Mithali Raj (59), Amita Sharma (33) and Anagha Deshpande (32).         
	Caroline Atkins (69) and Claire Taylor (69) shared an unbroken 125-run second wicket stand to take England to victory with 11.3 overs to spare.         
	Englands second successive victory puts them on top of Group B, assuring them a place in the Super Six, while India is second with one win and one defeat.         
	India next face Sri Lanka at Bankstown on Thursday, while England meet third-placed Pakistan at the North Sydney Oval.         
	Earlier, India slipped from 92 for three to 126 for nine in just 14 overs before a late onslaught by Amita Sharma lifted them to their eventual total. Amita hit five fours and a six in a 24-ball 33.         
	Left-arm spinner Holly Colvin was the star of Englands bowling attack, picking up three for 22. Fast bowler Jenny Gunn also bagged three while new-ball bowler Isa Guha finished with two for 16 after claiming the wickets of both the openers.         
	In Group A, defending champion Australia had a comfortable 61-run victory over South Africa while New Zealand put in another tidy bowling performance to defeat the West Indies by 56 runs, to join England in the Super Six.         
	SUMMARISED SCORES         
	Australia 258/4 (K. Rolton 96 .., S. Nitschke 87). SA 197 (S. Nitschke 3/43). Australia won by 61 runs New Zealand 192/8. (S. Tsukigawa 41 .., S. Taylor 2/33). WI 136/8 (P. Lavine 40, L.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United win 2-1
                                                   United win 2-1
                      
	London: Edwin van der Sar lost his record-breaking run without conceding but Manchester United won 2-1 at Newcastle to move seven points clear at the top of the English Premier League with a game in hand on Wednesday.         
	After stretching his record to 1,311 minutes without conceding a goal since November 8, Dutch goalkeeper Van der Sar handed Newcastle a ninth-minute lead at St James Park by failing to hold a shot, only for Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov to make up for the mistake.         
	The result means Alex Fergusons team has 65 points from 27 games. Chelsea, who won 1-0 at Portsmouth on Tuesday and Liverpool, who beat Sunderland 2-0, have 58 from 28.         
	Fourth-placed Aston Villa lost further ground with a 2-0 loss at Manchester City and lead Arsenal by only three points in the race for the fourth Champions League spot.         
	Everton and Blackburn drew 0-0 and West Ham won 1-0 at Wigan thanks to a goal by Carlton Cole although the striker was then sent off for his second yellow card.         
	Stoke eased their relegation worries with a 2-0 victory over Bolton, Tottenham did the same by outplaying struggling Middlesbrough 4-0, and Hull won 1-0 at Fulham.

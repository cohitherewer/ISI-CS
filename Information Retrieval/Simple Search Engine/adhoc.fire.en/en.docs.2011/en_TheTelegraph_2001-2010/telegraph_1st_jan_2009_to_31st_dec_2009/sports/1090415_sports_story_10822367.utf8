                                                   Defence worries United
  - CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 
  -   Fergusons men face an uphill task at Porto; Arsenal meet Villarreal                         
	Lisbon: European champions Manchester United will probably have to rely on more than another winning goal from teenager Federico Macheda to eliminate Porto from the Champions League on Wednesday.         
	Macheda, 17, came on as a substitute in the last two Premier League matches to score crucial winners against Aston Villa and Sunderland.         
	But United will have to tighten up their defence, be more creative in midfield and overcome mental fatigue to eliminate Porto, who surprised many people with their pace and fighting spirit in last weeks 2-2 draw at Old Trafford.         
	United recovered from a goal down after an early Cristian Rodriguez strike and led 2-1 with five minutes left following goals by Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez.         
	But a lack of defensive concentration allowed Mariano to equalise in the dying minutes.         
	We only have ourselves to blame. It just exemplified the fragile nature of our defending at the moment, United manager Alex Ferguson said.         
	Fergusons main concern is the sudden fragility of his defence, which looked all but impregnable this season until Liverpool thrashed them 4-1 at Old Trafford a month ago.         
	United have since conceded seven goals in four matches and Ferguson will hope England defender Rio Ferdinand recovers from a groin injury.         
	Ferguson should be able to field striker Dimitar Berbatov who has recovered from an ankle injury which ruled him out of the first leg.         
	Its a difficult job now, Ferguson said of his teams bid to become the first English side to win at Portos Dragao Stadium.         
	United have not won in three visits to Porto. The Portuguese club eliminated United in the 2004 quarter finals after winning the first leg 2-1 at home under coach Jose Mourinho, going on to win the title.         
	In 11 home games against English opposition, Porto have won five and drawn six. United would also advance by scoring more than two goals in a draw.         
	Porto coach Jesualdo Ferreira said the quality of his sides display at Old Trafford was even more important than the two away goals.         
	It highlights the performance which gives us confidence and optimism. There were periods in which we were brilliant, he said.         
	Brazilian striker Givanildo Hulk Vieira is still looking for his first goal in European play but is undeterred by Manchester Uniteds reputation.         
	All I know is that we have quality players in our team and we can stand up to them, he said.         
	Plaudits for the teams fearless show have left them brimming with confidence that they can eliminate United again, just as they did under Mourinho in 2004 but no one is getting too carried away.         
	The 2-2 result is very positive but there are still 90 minutes left. If we want to reach the semi-finals, we have to be humble as Manchester United have a lot of quality, captain Lucho Gonzalez said.         
	Meanwhile, Porto coach Jesualdo Ferreira has been banned from the touchline for Wednesdays match against United. (AGENCIES)

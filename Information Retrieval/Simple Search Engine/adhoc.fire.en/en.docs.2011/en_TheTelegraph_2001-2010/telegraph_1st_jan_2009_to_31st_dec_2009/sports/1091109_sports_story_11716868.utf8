                                                                                                                                     Ricky Ponting: Couldnt have asked for more
  - I would also have opted to bat first, says the Australian captain       OUR CORRESPONDENT             Australia captain Ricky Ponting with Yuvraj Singh after the match in Guwahati on Sunday. (AFP)                                 
	Guwahati: Ricky Pontings dislike for seven-match ODI series is well known. Seven games is just too much, he had said after the series against England which Australia won 6-1.         
	But Sunday the Australia captain didnt have anything negative to say about the ongoing seven-match series against India. Even if he had, he left it for some other day.         
	How much the series victory means to him and his team became clear when he described it as his most satisfying, achieved as it was by an inexperienced side.                 
	The following are excerpts         
	The series win         
	It is very satisfying after all we have been through like the injuries to our key players. It is remarkable to play as a team and win in difficult conditions with a bunch of youngsters. It is up there with the specials I have been involved in like the World Cup and the Champions Trophy wins. India is hard place to tour. This victory means a lot to me. Couldnt have asked for more.         
	On the turning point in the match         
	The couple of early wickets. We made the most of the conditions and made an impact with the new ball. The bowlers should get the credit 27 for five is just too much.         
	Bollingers five-wicket haul         
	He bowled brilliantly on a pitch that offered little assistance. He has been improving since the Delhi game. Once we got the early wickets we were in control of the game.         
	On Dhonis decision to bat first         
	I would also have opted to bat. India must be thinking of seeing the new ball off as the wicket got better from there. I dont think it was a 27 for 5 wicket. Our bowlers did a great job. The way they started after second ball of the day went for six was really remarkable. We used the new ball very well.         
	Problem of plenty with the youngsters coming good         
	It is always a nice problem to have. We now have a new crop of bowlers. It has been a remarkable effort. The players have responded well to the trying conditions. Nobody is whining and shirking Everybody is trying to do what is best for the team. We have got better with each game. It is a good building experience for the 2011 World Cup.         
	The injuries         
	We knew it would be hard but we also knew that if we played as a unit we would get close to winning. We played as a unit, stuck together in the last few games in trying conditions.         
	The gains from the series         
	More than playing and winning we have been able to provide exposure to the youngsters before the World Cup... That is important.

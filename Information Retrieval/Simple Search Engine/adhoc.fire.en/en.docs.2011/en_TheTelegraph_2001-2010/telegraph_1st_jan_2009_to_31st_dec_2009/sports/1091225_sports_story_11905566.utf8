            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Local girl Shivika Burman reached the semi-finals of the Vishwarupa Tubes National Grasscourt Tennis Championship on Thursday. The second seed outclassed Air Indias Geeta Manohar 6-1, 6-3 in 71 minutes.         
	However, it was the end of the road for fifth seed Treta Bhattacharyya after she lost 6-1, 2-6, 4-6 to defending champion Rushmi Chakravarthi. Despite winning the first set, Treta lost out in a 115-minute encounter.         
	On the mens side, top seed V.M. Ranjeet of Tamil Nadu went down 4-6, 7-6(10-8), 3-6 to P.C. Vignesh, the fifth seed from Andhra Pradesh, after a see-saw battle. Vignesh could have won in straight sets but lost a match-deciding point in the second set tiebreak.         
	Also bidding goodbye was third seed Yannick Nelord. Qualifier Vivek Shokeen defeated him 7-6(7-5), 7-6(7-5) to reach the last-four stage.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India are not among favourites for World T20, say Pak greats
                                                   India are not among favourites for World T20, say Pak greats
                      
	Karachi: Former Pakistan captains Zaheer Abbas and Wasim Akram Sunday refused to count defending champions India as favourites to retain the World Twenty20 title, saying the Indian players would be too tired to go for a kill after a hectic last season, coupled with the Indian Premier League (IPL) grind.         
	I think there are no favourites in such a tournament. Anyone among Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa can win the World Cup, he said.         
	If the IPL is good practice for the players ahead of the World Cup, the Indians have been playing too much cricket and would be tired by the time the tournament is held, Abbas said.         
	Akram also agreed that India could face problems this time because their players would be tired after a long and tough season. In such a tournament, it is very difficult to maintain a long winning streak and you need to be fresh for the challenge, he added.         
	The two, however, had different opinions about runners-up Pakistans chances in the upcoming tournament. Abbas felt Pakistan had only a distant chance to claim the coveted trophy.         
	I would love to see Pakistan win but the fact is that the World Cup is being held in different conditions and it will be very tough, said Abbas, known as the black Bradman.         
	However, Akram tipped Pakistan as favourites to win the tournament because he felt their bowling is suitable for the English conditions.         
	And they have a very good track record in T20 cricket. But more then anything, I believe our bowling is strong and ideal for the English conditions and pitches, the former fast bowler said.         
	I dont think any other team has so much variety and experience in their bowling line-up, he added.         
	Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam also said that Pakistan were among favourites to win the title. We will be relying a lot on our spinners. Because in T20 cricket, I believe more than the fast bowlers, the bowlers who can vary the pace are more successful. And we have some very good spinners, too, he said.

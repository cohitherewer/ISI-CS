                                                     Azhar: Happy somebody outstanding broke it
    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL     -  FORMER INDIA CAPTAIN ON HIS RECORD BEING ECLIPSED             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mohammed Azharuddin                                       
	Calcutta: Mohammed Azharuddins 62-ball hundred against New Zealand in Vadodaras Moti Bagh Stadium (December 1988) wasnt only an India, but a world record, till Sanath Jayasuriya smashed it in April 1996.         
	The former captains India-specific record, though, lasted till as recently as Wednesday  when Virender Blaster Sehwag lashed a 60-ball hundred in Hamilton.         
	While Azhar had finished on an unbeaten 108 (65 balls), vice-captain Sehwag remained not out on 125 (74 balls) at the Seddon Park.         
	Azhar, who has just taken guard in politics, spoke to The Telegraph on Thursday morning. He praised Sehwag and Team India.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q When did you get to know that Sehwag had broken your record?         
	A I was in Jaipur for a meeting... Thats where somebody mentioned it... Later, when I had the time, I watched the highlights of the India innings.         
	Disappointed that your record has gone...         
	As they say, records are meant to be broken... Im happy that somebody as outstanding as Sehwag is the new record-holder... Theres no regret.         
	Are you surprised that your record survived for over 20 years?         
	Indeed, yes... I say that because the game has changed You have the power-plays and so on... Also, bowling standards, across the world, have fallen. There are more opportunities too, to have a go at any record.         
	What are your memories of your own record?         
	I dont think anybody mentioned the world record bit at the ground From what I remember, wed all been delighted that we could chase 279 (India, under Dilip Vengsarkar, finished on 282 for eight)... Back then, chasing that many was considered a big achievement, somewhat like chasing 350-360 in the present times.         
	So, when did you get to know that youd created history?         
	When we returned to the hotel... Teammate Rashid Patel gave me the news, Azharbhai, aap ne to world record kar diya... I recall having had a big partnership with Ajay Sharma, who scored 50.         
	Your record was also against New Zealand...         
	(Laughs) Just a coincidence, you cant explain such happenings.         
	Whats your take on Sehwag?         
	As Ive said, hes outstanding... Hes very positive and doesnt care about anything, neither the bowling nor the conditions... He should be allowed to play the way he does... Hes had his share of slumps, but has emerged as a pillar of strength for the team.         
	Sehwags USP would be...         
	His attitude, he brings a lot of positivity to the team.         
	Actually, Sehwags ODI debut (against Pakistan in Mohali, March 1999) was in the period when you were the regular India captain. What did you make of him then?         
	I didnt play in his debut match... Obviously, he was talented... Im happy that, like me, he scored a hundred on his Test debut (Bloemfontein, November 2001)... Its remarkable that somebody who started as a middle-order batsman is making such an impact as an opener... Provided Sehwag stays fit, he could play for another six-seven years and script the future he wants.         
	Team Indias in the middle of a dream run...         
	Its such a balanced team... Very good batting unit, a couple of very good new-ball bowlers (Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma) and a very good spinner in Harbhajan Singh... Balance is critical and this team has it.         
	Your thoughts on the captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni?         
	Hes good... He trusts his players, which is important He has confidence in them Then, because he himself delivers, theres no pressure of personal-performance. Clearly, the players rally around him.         
	As a batting unit, where would you place this bunch vis-a-vis the outstanding line-ups of the past?         
	I dont like comparing and, really, one shouldnt set out to do that... Bowling standards arent the same, the game has seen changes... Times have changed I wouldnt like to comment.         
	Barring the occasional injury, Sachin Tendulkar is still going great guns. Like a Sourav Ganguly, would you too like to see him around till the 2011 World Cup?         
	Look, its going to be a personal call... He has to decide Of course, Ill be very happy if Sachins available till then, but he has to preserve himself. Thats important.         
	A couple of personal questions... What did you and Pervez Musharraf tell each other in New Delhi the other day?         
	He said he used to follow my career and wanted to know how I was keeping myself busy nowadays He responded by saying good, when I informed him that Id joined the Congress...         
	The final one: Are you standing in the elections?         
	It hasnt been decided... Its for the Congress to take that decision... If asked to, I will contest... Im quite enjoying this innings in politics... I get to meet a lot of people from across society... Politics, I suppose, will help me grow as an individual... Im new in it, but the experiences so far have been quite different from the ones when I used to be playing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Teammates hope Symmo will return
                                                     Teammates hope Symmo will return
                  Andrew Symonds                     
	London: Andrew Symonds, who was dropped from the Twenty20 World Cup squad at the last minute, continues to enjoy the backing of his teammates, who are convinced that the temperamental all-rounder would return to the Australian squad again.         
	Speedster Brett Lee described Symonds as worlds greatest guy and was optimistic about his return to the national team.         
	To lose a player of his calibre leaves a big hole in the team but hopefully he will be back shortly, said Lee.         
	Im disappointed hes flying home. As his teammates we will be trying our hardest to make sure he gets back in the Australian cricket team at some stage, he was quoted as saying by an Australian news agency.         
	Whats happened with Andrew is a very personal blow to him but as mates well be sticking by him and making sure we give him our best advice and the help he needs, the 32-year-old pacer added.         
	Lee conceded Symonds would be missed in the Twenty20 World Cup but he urged teammates to lift themselves and focus on the job ahead.         
	Fellow pacer Nathan Bracken said he too was sorry to see Symonds leave in such a fashion.         
	Hes a tremendous talent, he fits in and gets on well with the boys and to say it is the end of his career is a big call, said Bracken.         
	An equally sad Mike Hussey said other players need to put behind the episode and concentrate on the job at hand.         
	Weve got to concentrate on our preparations and make sure we are 100 per cent ready for the West Indies on Saturday. We cant afford to let it affect our preparations, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Cricket Australia (CA) revealed Symonds had gone missing from the team hotel, prompting the management to throw him out of the Twenty20 World Cup squad for breach of discipline.         
	Soon after the all-rounder was ordered home two days before the teams opener against the West Indies following alcohol-related incidents, CA general manger of public affairs Peter Young provided partial detail about what exactly happened. Broadly speaking, he broke team rules. He broke team rules by going out when he wasnt supposed to, by... leaving the hotel without advising where he had gone, all of that is in breach to team rules, Young told a radio channel.

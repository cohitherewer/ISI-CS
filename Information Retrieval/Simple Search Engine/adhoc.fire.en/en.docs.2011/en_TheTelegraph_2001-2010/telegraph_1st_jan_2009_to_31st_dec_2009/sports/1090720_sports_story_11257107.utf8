The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vaas to quit Test cricket
                                                     Vaas to quit Test cricket
                              
	Colombo: Within a fortnight of dismissing his retirement rumours, Sri Lankas most successful pacer Chaminda Vaas Sunday announced that he will quit Test cricket after the ongoing series against Pakistan.         
	Im officially retiring from Test cricket after the third Test against Pakistan but will continue playing one-day and Twenty20 matches till the 2011 World Cup, Vaas told reporters at the Sinhalese Sports Club.         
	Earlier this month, chief selector Asantha de Mel had revealed that Vaas had a discussion with him after the pacer had made up his mind to quit the longer version.         
	Vaas, however, went on to deny it and after being ignored for the first two Tests against Pakistan, the 35-year-old pacer was recalled in the Sri Lanka squad for the third and final match starting Monday.         
	Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara, who had earlier announced that Vaas would get a farewell game, paid rich tribute to the pacer, who is the only third Sri Lankan after Sanath Jayasuriya and Muttiah Muralidharan to play more than 100 Tests.         
	Vaasy is a true champion and probably the only Sri Lankan fast bowler who can be called a true legend of the game, he said.         
	Whoever replaces Vaasy in the bowling attack will take years and years to reach the standards he has set  and maybe they never will, Sangakkara said.         
	He has got a great part to play in our one-day set-up until the World Cup in 2011 and maybe beyond it as long as he is fit, he said.         
	Vaas took the first ODI eight-for against Zimbabwe, which included a hattrick. (PTI)  Chaminda Vaas  Tests: 110

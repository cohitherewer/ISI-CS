The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB settles for cash   in Cup row
                                                   PCB settles for cash   in Cup row
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: In losing its hosting rights for World Cup 2011, Pakistan has not settled for any monetary loss after the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) came to an agreement that the latter will retain its hosting fees and also receive an additional payment as reasonable compensation for losing out on World Cup matches.         
	The resolution, which brings to an end the hosting rights dispute, was reached during a meeting Thursday between the world governing body president David Morgan and the PCB chairman Ijaz Butt at the ICC office in Dubai and ensures the PCB withdraws legal proceedings against the ICC. A settlement to the effect was to be signed by both parties later Thursday.         
	In an agreement with the commercial arm of the ICC it was further decided that the PCB would be free of its liabilities and obligations associated with hosting matches during the tournament, including the location of the tournament secretariat, which had originally been set for Lahore.         
	The ICC board in April had decided that Pakistan could no longer host the 14 matches it was originally supposed to because of the prevailing security situation in the country.         
	Morgan said: This resolution is good for world cricket and provides an improved platform for World Cup 2011 as we now have a degree of certainty surrounding the event. I am glad we were able to come to an amicable agreement and I believe this is a fair resolution for the PCB and the ICC.         
	[The PTI adds from Karachi that the PCB is still insisting on the inclusion of a special clause in the final settlement document with the ICC that gives it some hope of hosting a few World Cup matches at home. Reliable sources in the PCB said that Butt had pushed for the inclusion of the special clause.]

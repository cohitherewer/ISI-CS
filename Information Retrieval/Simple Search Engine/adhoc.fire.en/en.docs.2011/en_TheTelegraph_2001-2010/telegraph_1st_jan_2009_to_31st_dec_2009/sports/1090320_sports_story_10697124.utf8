	Cape Town: Fast bowler Dale Steyn took four wickets to give South Africa the upper hand on the first day of the third Test as Australia were bowled out for 209 at Newlands on Thursday.         
	Australia were on 158 for five after tea and South Africa pressed home their advantage with Steyn and Paul Harris collecting two wickets each, having put the visitors under pressure in the first two sessions.         
	Left-arm spinner Harris needed just four deliveries to remove Brad Haddin (42) leg-before.         
	Mitchell Johnson struck six powerful boundaries in his 35, but was caught by Ashwell Prince running around the long-on boundary off Steyn.         
	He also added the wicket of debutant Bryce McGain (2), well taken at second slip by AB de Villiers, to finish with four for 56. 30-year-old Harris ended with three for 34 in 17 overs.         
	South Africa, who have lost the series, had made 57 without loss at the close of play. Prince, opening the batting for the first time at Test level, scored an unbeaten 37 and debutant Imraan Khan looked impressive as he reached 15 not out.         
	The opening pair took 20 runs off Johnson in the fifth over of their innings. Australian captain Ricky Ponting was sufficiently irked by the assault to immediately remove the most successful bowler of the series from the attack.         
	South Africa recovered from dropping both opening batsmen to reduce Australia to 66 for two at lunch.         
	Stand-in captain Jacques Kallis then called on Steyn to open the bowling and he produced two speedy deliveries to take Michael Hussey for 20 and Michael Clarke for a duck.         
	Australia opener Simon Katich (55) proved more difficult to dislodge, batting for 229 minutes and adding 71 for the fifth wicket with Haddin.         
	Fellow opener Phillip Hughes also received a life when JP Duminy made a hash of a catch off Harris at extra cover. The mistake did not prove costly, however, as Hughes missed a sweep at Harris two balls later and was adjudged leg-before-wicket for 33.         
	Pontingwas out for a duck as he edged a delivery which swung away late from Albie Morkel into the gloves of wicketkeeper Mark Boucher.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dissenting teams meet deadline
                                                   Dissenting teams meet deadline
            THE TIMES, LONDON AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Champions Ferrari eased fears that they would walk away from Formula One by joining the other existing teams on Friday in signing up conditionally for next season.         
	Several would-be newcomers, including former competitors Lola and a Kuwaiti-financed Prodrive entry that could ultimately appear as an Aston Martin team, also applied to race against them.         
	Friday was the deadline for entries to be submitted and all eyes were on Ferrari, the glamour team who had threatened to turn their back on the sport after an unbroken 60-year involvement unless the 2010 rules were rewritten.         
	The Formula One Teams Association (Fota), led by Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo, said in a statement, however, that all members had entered and were prepared to commit to 2012 providing certain conditions were met.         
	First, they said a new edition of the confidential Concorde Agreement governing the sport must be signed by all parties by June 12.         
	Secondly, next years regulations must be based on the 2009 rules amended in accordance with proposals that Fota has submitted to the FIA.         
	There was no immediate comment from the governing International Automobile Federation (FIA), who will publish the official entry list on June 12 and had wanted to introduce an optional 40 million ($64.14 million) budget cap in 2010.         
	Ferrari had rejected this, saying it would lead to an unacceptable two-tier series, and FIA president Max Mosley suggested last weekend that the measure could be postponed by a year to allow a glide path.         
	Fota said the teams looked forward to collaborating proactively and productively with the FIA.         
	The statement added that they hoped to establish a solid foundation on which the future of a healthy and successful Formula One can be built, providing lasting stability and sound governance.         
	Fota did not comment directly on FIAs budget cap plan. Under a reported compromise, the 2010 season could start with teams operating under a euro100 million ($140 million) cap in exchange for sharing technology with new teams. The $60 million cap would be deferred until 2011.         
	However, sources close to Mosley were sounding confident Friday that the cap would still come in, even if Mosleys target figure of 40 million may not be reached until 2011. Ecclestone was also reasonably confident about the cap. Oh yes, I am sure there will be a cap, he said. This is the beginning of something positive.         
	Former world champions Williams had already confirmed their unconditional entry on Monday and have been suspended from Fota by the other nine teams.         
	Prodrive, led by former Benetton and BAR team boss David Richards, submitted an entry earlier on Friday while a spokesman for chassis maker Lola confirmed that companys move.         
	Richards is also the chairman of Aston Martin, majority owned by Kuwaits Investment Dar.         
	Prodrive would have entered in 2008, with a plan to run customer cars provided by McLaren, but withdrew due to uncertainty over the regulations.         
	The level of next years cost cap has risen substantially since we originally considered entering, said Richards.         
	However everyone appears committed to major reductions in future years and when one takes into account the transition proposals for new teams we are confident that we now have the opportunity to be both commercially viable and competitive.         
	The FIA has said there would be room for three new teams to come into Formula One if all the existing ones stay.

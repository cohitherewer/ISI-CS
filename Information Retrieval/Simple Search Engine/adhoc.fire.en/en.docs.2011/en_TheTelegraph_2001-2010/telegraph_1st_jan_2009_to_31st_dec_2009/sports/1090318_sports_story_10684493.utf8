The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dravid still a class act: Crowe
                                                   Dravid still a class act: Crowe
                      
	Hamilton: Former New Zealand captain Martin Crowe feels beleaguered Indian batsman Rahul Dravid has regained his confidence and appeared to be in reasonable form to score a century in the first Test beginning here on Wednesday.         
	One man who will go into the Test matches with a lot of confidence from the Indian line-up would be Rahul Dravid. I worked with him closely during last years Indian Premier League (IPL). He has obviously shown that he is in reasonable form in the warm-up game for Canterbury, Crowe wrote in his column for a cricket website.         
	He is still a class act. I would imagine that if he can get in early in the first Test and feel comfortable, then the memories of batting in New Zealand where he has scored hundreds before will be there to help him to find three figures once more, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Were more ambitious now: Daniel Vettori
                                                   Were more ambitious now: Daniel Vettori
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Johannesburg: The Australia-New Zealand rivalry isnt as big as India-Pakistan or Australia-England, but its status isnt that of a footnote either. So, expect a tight Champions Trophy final, in neighbouring Centurion, on Monday.         
	The concern, though, is that theres a 30 per cent chance of rain. Given the tight schedules everywhere, theres no reserve day. The International Cricket Council brass will, therefore, be having fingers crossed.         
	For entirely different reasons, Australia captain Ricky Ponting, too. New Zealand, after all, have nothing to lose and are intent on matching their Nairobi 2000 performance.         
	New Zealand are always competitive... The team plays to its strengths and is disciplined (in its approach)... New Zealand may not have the most flamboyant players, but theyve got guys to stand up and do the job, Ponting acknowledged.         
	As for the trans-Tasman rivalry, he commented: Its a great one... Be it in cricket, rugby or netball...         
	Counterpart Daniel Vettori said: I wouldve felt better if there was a two-day break after the semi-final (against Pakistan)... However, making the final is in itself a motivation... Australias form has been very impressive... Weve probably had a reputation of giving it up against them and would like to change it...         
	Vettori and Co. have already changed the bit about losing in semi-finals, something the captain talked about on the eve of the match against Pakistan.         
	The key to doing well is worrying about our game and not the oppositions... Tactics are fine, but its the implementation which matters, Vettori pointed out.         
	He added: My mission is to lead with performances and, if I do so, then the team will follow... You could say were more ambitious now and have a greater desire as opposed to being happy just making the semi-final... Were into good space as a team.         
	Vettori (like Ponting) has definitely been leading from the front.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph before the final training session in Centurion, Vettori made the point that winning the Champions Trophy would give his small country of four million people something to talk about over an extended period.         
	Crickets the No.2 sport (behind rugby), but everybody would rejoice if we take home some silverware, he said, smiling.         
	While Ponting indicated that the XI which played in the semi-final (against England) would be retained, Vettori suggested that offie Jeetan Patel could make the cut.         
	The Centurion wickets are quite different from the ones here.         
	New Zealand have lost three players on account of injuries, but the Australians have also suffered  vice-captain Michael Clarke is back home with a back problem.         
	I cant let injuries worry me... Ive got to have faith in the guys who get the chance to perform... I have had six-seven guys stepping up and performing, Vettori maintained.         
	Meanwhile, Aleem Dar, who received the Umpire of the Year award the other night, will be officiating in the final with Ian Gould.         
	Dars award, by the way, would go some way towards correcting the decades old impression of Pakistani umpires.         
	Match starts: 6 pm (IST).

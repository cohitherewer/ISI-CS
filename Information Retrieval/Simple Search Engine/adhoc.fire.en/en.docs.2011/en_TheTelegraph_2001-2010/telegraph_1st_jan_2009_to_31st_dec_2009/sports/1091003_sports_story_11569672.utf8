The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | McCullum: Am sure relationship with Sourav will remain strong 
                                                   McCullum: Am sure relationship with Sourav will remain strong 
  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL : THE NZ VICE-CAPTAIN ON KKR AND THE 2009-10 SEASON         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                            Brendon McCullum      
	Johannesburg: Brendon McCullum, the New Zealand vice-captain, is among the most exciting of batsmen in limited overs cricket --- be it the 50-over game or in T20.         
	McCullum (28), who is on the rolls of the Kolkata Knight Riders, spoke to The Telegraph on Friday, after a truly exhausting training session at the Wanderers.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q To start with the Knights... Are you available for the 2010 IPL?         
	A (Grins) Theres still some water to go under the bridge... At this stage, because of Australias tour of New Zealand, Im definitely not available for the entire edition... Lets see what happens between now and next March... Eventually, one could be available for around 60 per cent of the 2010 IPL.         
	Five months on, how do you look back on this years IPL, where the Knights finished last?         
	We had high hopes, but the way we went was disappointing... Hopefully, well learn from our mistakes and become better and stronger... Well be drawing inspiration from the Deccan Chargers and the Royal Challengers Bangalore, who finished one and two after being at the bottom in 2008... The way I see it (in T20), if youre on a winning run, then that gets maintained... If youre on a losing streak, that stays, too... Id wanted, as always, to make an impact, but that didnt happen.         
	John Buchanan chose you to be the captain this year... Now that hes out of the franchise, do you expect uncomfortable moments in the dressing room?         
	I dont think so... I hope not... Everybody involved with the Knights is very much committed... Therell be a new coach and I do expect a different environment... Therell be different challenges and Im confident everybody will work in the best interest of the franchise.         
	Sourav Ganguly, whom you replaced at the helm, is expected to be back as the captain. How would that work out?         
	Im not sure wholl be the captain, but if its Sourav, then he and I share a good relationship... Im sure this relationship will remain strong.         
	Youre the New Zealand vice-captain and have already captained a few matches in a stand-in capacity. Did leading the Knights give you a better insight into captaincy?         
	Look, one will learn by captaining a team with such a huge following and by leading it in such a huge environment as the IPL... Down the track, Im sure the lessons Ive learnt will come in handy.         
	The captaincy, though, changed your game... We didnt see the free-flowing McCullum...         
	The way we were playing, the pressure we put ourselves under... Those things contributed... I did play a bit more aggressively later, but I did have to mould my game differently early on.         
	Has the captaincy experience, both with the Knights and in a stand-in capacity for New Zealand, whetted your appetite for the job?         
	(Grins) At the moment, my job is to score runs and take catches... Play my role as New Zealands vice-captain... I like making an impact and my job is to help the team become more consistent... Of course, if Im found worthy, it would be great to captain New Zealand.         
	Youre the aggressive type and that, surely, is your USP...         
	I like being positive, like getting on to the front foot... I enjoy playing the aggressive brand of cricket. But, then, there could be times when the teams requirement is different. I have to adjust then.         
	Your blazing 158 not out in the 2008 IPL opener, in Bangalore, caught everybodys imagination. Have you, since, grown as a cricketer?         
	Id like to think so... Every experience tends to make you a better cricketer and it would be nice to always have a performance up on the board... I took a lot of positives from that one innings.         
	Given the pressure on todays cricketers, how do you handle it?         
	I dont think there are that many jobs which could be done with as much fun... Pressure, really, is part and parcel of the game... At times, it gets tough and youve got to think beyond yourself, but one accepts it.         
	The last one: What are your thoughts on the eve of the semi-finals (against Pakistan) here and when looking to the rest of the season?         
	Oh, Im pretty excited... Ive made a few contributions in this Champions Trophy and it would be satisfying to win the tournament... Theres a lot of cricket ahead... Ill be looking to maintain the form Im in. (After a pause) Once the Champions Trophy ends, Ill be in India for the Champions League and it would be nice to do well for the Otago Volts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Governor writes to the CAB
                                                   Governor writes to the CAB
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: An official letter addressed to the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president reached the association on Tuesday from the state governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi.         
	The content of the letter was not revealed, but according to sources, it addressed issues that the governor had brought up at the CAB annual awards ceremony on Saturday.         
	The governor had urged the CAB to conserve power by refraining from the use of floodlights when not required.         
	But the letter may not come up for discussion in the CAB annual general meeting (AGM).         
	The issues which the members want to discuss should be submitted at least a couple of months prior to the AGM, CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey said. We wont, of course, ignore a letter from the governor. It can be discussed at a later date.         
	Meanwhile, Tushar Sarkar, who was supposed to represent Aryadaha in the working committee meetings, will attend the hearing on Wednesday at the CAB. Sultan Ahmed, who was also asked to attend the hearing, is likely to skip it.         
	In a separate development, sources revealed that the CAB assured Chinmoy Roy, Bengals fitness trainer, that he would be retained.

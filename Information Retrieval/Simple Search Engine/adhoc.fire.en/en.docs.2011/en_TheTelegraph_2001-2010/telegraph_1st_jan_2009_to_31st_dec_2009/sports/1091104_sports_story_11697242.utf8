The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Srikkanth amp; Co. stumped!
                                                                                                                                     Srikkanth amp; Co. stumped!
    - Selectors had been confident Team india wouldnt lose in Mohali           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            A despondent Yuvraj Singh returns to the pavilion after being run out for 12 during the fourth ODI   against Australia in Mohali. India, at that time, were on 113 and his dismissal was the turning point   of Mondays match                                             
	New Delhi: At the end of it all, no change may have been effected, but the national selectors retained the Team India XV for the last three ODIs against Australia, in Mohali on Monday, assuming that the target of 251 would be achieved at the PCA Stadium there.         
	According to The Telegraphssources, Krishnamachari Srikkanth and his colleagues (Yashpal Sharma, Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave, Raja Venkat) met informally during the break between innings and decided not to disturb a combination which was actually on course to take a 3-1 lead.         
	They got stumped, though.         
	At that stage, it was taken for granted that the target would be reached and the lead extended... Nobody expected Team India to throw it all away... In any case, the selectors had consulted the captain (Mahendra Singh Dhoni) before the match got under way, one source pointed out.         
	Not that the eventual result, a 24-run win for Australia, could really have made much of a difference.         
	Look, our bench strength is just not there... Even if the selectors had waited till the end, I dont think they would have sprung a surprise... Frankly, the cupboard is pretty bare, another source said.         
	Surely, its time for the alarm bells to ring. But, then, those in the XV shouldnt be taking their places for granted.         
	As many as three youngsters  Virat Kohli (at No.3), Suresh Raina (No.6) and Ravindra Jadeja (No.7)  had the chance to become a hero, in Mohali, but failed to make an impression.         
	Its time, perhaps, to blood a Manish Pandey. The youngster made headlines in the closing stages of this years IPL, in South Africa, and has begun the 2009-10 Ranji Trophy with a big hundred for Karnataka.         
	Getting a Pandey into the XV would, among other things, serve as a wake-up call to those whore happy contributing little or almost nothing at all.         
	The fifth ODI, meanwhile, will be played in Hyderabad on Thursday.

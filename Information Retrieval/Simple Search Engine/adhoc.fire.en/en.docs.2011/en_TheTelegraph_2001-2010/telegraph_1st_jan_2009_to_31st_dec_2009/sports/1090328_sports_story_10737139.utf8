The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Four players join camp
                                                   Four players join camp
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) preparatory camp at Eden Gardens on Friday was not as dramatic as Thursdays. There was a posse of policemen  uniformed as well as plainclothes  who, except for throwing a security ring around cricket manager John Buchanan when he arrived at the stadium, had nothing much to do.         
	Inside the ground, it was much like Thursday though. A round of baseball, innovative fielding practices, running between the wickets and match simulations at the end to round off the days work.         
	Friday saw four players joining the camp. Aakash Chopra, Mohnish Parmar, Iqbal Abdullah and Shoaib Sheikh went through the paces along with Sourav, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Sourav Sarkar and Arindam Ghosh.         
	Sourav and Shukla were seen in animated discussion with Buchanan and the Australians multi-skipper idea seemed to be in practice already. When Sourav and Chopra opened in one of the match simulations, Shukla was setting the field and when the current Bengal captain was batting, Chopra was calling the shots.         
	Sourav entertained the motley crowd that turned out to see some fireworks with some solid hitting. Two sixes and four fours were cheered lustily by his die-hard fans.For the record, Sourav will be flying to Mumbai on Saturday to meet KKR co-owner Shah Rukh Khan and will be missing the practice session.         
	Meanwhile, defending champions Rajasthan Royals will be based at Sahara Park Newlands in Cape Town.

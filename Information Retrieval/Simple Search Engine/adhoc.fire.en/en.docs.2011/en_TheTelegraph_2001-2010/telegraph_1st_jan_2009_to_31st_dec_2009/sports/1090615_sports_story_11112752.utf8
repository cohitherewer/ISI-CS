    - South Africa coach Mickey Arthur on the Indians             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mickey Arthur                                 
	London: Mickey Arthur, South Africas coach, is a big fan of Team India. However, he does feel the side needs to play as a team and not as a bunch of supremely talented individuals.         
	That, in my view, is probably the only shortcoming... Otherwise, the Indians are so naturally gifted... The talent is immense, Arthur told The Telegraph at the Royal Garden hotel.         
	Speaking on Sunday morning, before the days World T20 matches got under way, he added: Right now, we see Yuvraj (Singh) as posing the biggest threat...         
	The India-South Africa Super Eight clash is in Nottingham on Tuesday.         
	As were talking, I dont know whether that match will be of consequence to India, but if it is, wed be looking forward to doing what India did to us in 2007 (in the inaugural World T20)... Not even making the semi-finals of a world event, at home, did hurt us then, Arthur said.         
	The 37-run defeat in Durban had, indeed, proved too costly.         
	South Africas unbeaten run in this edition has, of course, made them favourites.         
	Were conscious of that label, yes, but wont allow pressure to get the better of us... Were taking each match as it comes and, for us, three (including the final) remain, Arthur maintained.         
	Praising his players, Arthur pointed out: They want to test themselves all the time... Given our standard, the opposition will have to play very well to beat us.         
	Arthur, who has completed four years, is on contract with Cricket South Africa till 2012.

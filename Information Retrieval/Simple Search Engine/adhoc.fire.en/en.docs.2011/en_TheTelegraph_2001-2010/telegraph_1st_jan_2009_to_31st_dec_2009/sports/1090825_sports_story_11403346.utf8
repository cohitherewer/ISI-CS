The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhutia issue may go back to panel
                                                     Bhutia issue may go back to panel
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bhaichung Bhutia                           
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF), which heaped praise on Bhaichung Bhutia on Sunday for playing 100 matches for the country, has so far come a cropper in solving the vexed issue of the national captains problems with Mohun Bagan.         
	So much so that 32 days after the emergency committee authorised the general secretary, Alberto Colaco, to find a solution, the AIFF is likely to refer the matter back to the Players Status Committee (PSC).         
	A meeting of the PSC has been called on September 2, said a source in the AIFF. Though no agenda has been announced so far, it is obvious that the Bhutia issue would come up for discussion in the PSC along with half a dozen other cases, the source added.         
	Federation sources further revealed that the general secretary may have very little new to say on this subject when he reports to the executive committee on August 30. He has held separate meetings with both Bhutia and Mohun Bagan, but failed to break the ice as both the parties have refused to soften their stands.         
	A section of the federation members felt that the AIFF had actually put the icon of Indian football in deeper trouble by jumping into the fray without being asked to.         
	The AIFF should have allowed the IFA to handle the matter instead of jumping the gun and referring the matter to the PSC, said a member.         
	One shouldnt be surprised if the PSC once again refers the issue back to the IFA. The entire process by the AIFF has so far produced nothing except wasting valuable time, the member added.         
	The ace striker, who struck a spectacular goal on Sunday to keep alive Indias hopes in the Nehru Cup, has been pleading for justice for more than a month now but nothing has materialised.         
	Bhutia, who is leading the national team for a hattrick of titles at the Ambedkar Stadium, even went to the extent of saying that it would be difficult for him to concentrate and give his best in the Nehru Cup unless he was cleared to get his release from Mohun Bagan. But neither the AIFF nor the IFA has come to his rescue so far.         
	Bhutia, however, was in a good mood on Monday .         
	We had a good day in office against Kyrgyzstan. I am confident we will continue our good form in the next match against Sri Lanka also. No team can take us lightly.         
	Bob Houghton also praised his team saying the boys were getting back to shape.         
	I am very pleased with their performance. But we should not take Sri Lanka lightly.

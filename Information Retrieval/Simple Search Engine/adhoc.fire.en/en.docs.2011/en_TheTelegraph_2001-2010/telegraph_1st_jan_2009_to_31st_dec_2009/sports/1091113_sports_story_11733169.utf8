The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SSP tied 7th
                                                                                                                                   SSP tied 7th
                      
	Hong Kong: SSP Chowrasias quest for his lost form seems to have ended and he lies tied seventh after a brilliant five-under 65 while Jeev Milkha Singh got off to a rather mundane start in the $2.5 million Hong Kong Open golf tournament here Thursday.         
	One shot behind at tied 16th was the duo of Jyoti Randhawa and Gaganjeet Bhullar, followed by Rahil Gangjee (67), Shiv Kapur (68), Gaurav Ghei (69). Jeev and Anirban Lahiri shared the 94th place, ahead of compatriots C. Muniyappa (73) and Digvijay Singh (76).

            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Herschelle Gibbs celebrates his century during South Africas fourth one-dayer against Australia in Port Elizabeth on Monday. (Reuters)                           
	Calcutta/Port Elizabeth: South Africa defeated Australia in the fourth one-day International to take an unassailable 3-1 lead in the series on Monday on the back of a match-winning performance from spinners Roelof van der Merwe and Johan Botha.         
	Australias openers had got off to a flying start, putting on 129 for the first wicket as they attempted to chase down South Africas imposing total of 317 for six. But South Africas spinners turned the match in the home sides favour and then fast bowler Dale Steyn finished off the tail, claiming four for 44.         
	The Proteas eventually dismissed Australia for 256 with more than four overs to spare, to win by 61 runs. The final match takes place in Johannesburg on Friday.         
	Australia started off in pursuit of their target with gusto, openers Brad Haddin (78) and Michael Clarke (50) adding 129 for the first wicket in 20.4 overs. First to go was Haddin, after hitting seven fours and four sixes in his 61-ball innings.         
	The successful bowler was Botha, who, although he took only one for 48, again slowed the Australian innings, in tandem with Van der Merwe. Botha was hit for 14 in his first over, and off his seventh ball he conceded a six to Haddin, with long-on fielder Wayne Parnell getting a hand to the ball before it hit the ropes. Three balls later Haddin hit to the same area, but this time it ended in Parnell taking the catch.         
	Van der Merwe, who took three for 37 in the previous match in Cape Town, finished with three for 46 on Monday. His first victim was Clarke, bowled after facing 68 balls, and hitting four fours.         
	The left-arm spinner then had Callum Ferguson stumped for three, and trapped Michael Hussey in front for two, to reduce Australia to 151 for four in the 28th over.         
	Captain Ricky Ponting (53) was then involved in partnerships of 37 and 38 with David Hussey (20) and James Hopes (31), but Steyn broke both stands. First he ran towards mid-wicket to catch Hussey off his own bowling, then, after being hit for four fours by Ponting, had the Aussie captain well caught at mid-wicket by Albie Morkel. Australias lower order put up little resistance as Steyn bowled Nathan Hauritz (3) and Shane Harwood (0). Others among the wickets were Wayne Parnell (1/64) and Morkel (1/25)         
	In South Africas innings, Herschelle Gibbs hit his 21st ODI century, hitting nine boundaries and two sixes in his 110. He and AB de Villiers set up the Proteas big total with a third-wicket partnership of 136, scoring at nearly seven an over at St Georges Park.         
	De Villiers smashed 84 off 74 balls with six fours and three sixes, two of which came off successive balls from off-spinner Hauritz to reach his half-century. De Villiers had a let-off when he was dropped on 57 by Ferguson in the deep.         
	The two were brought together after Graeme Smith was caught behind for 20 off a bottom edge. Jacques Kallis tried a cut shot on 17 but was caught on the third man boundary by Ferguson off debutant seamer Harwood.         
	Gibbs was the third man out, driving left-arm seamer Nathan Bracken straight to Clarke at deep mid-on. South Africa promoted big-hitter Morkel to No.5 in the order, but he was bowled for four early on in a batting Powerplay by Mitchell Johnson. De Villiers also fell to Johnson in the Powerplay, top-edging to Ferguson at mid-on.         
	Mark Boucher and JP Duminy added 65 in 7.2 overs for the sixth wicket.         
	Duminy sped to 40 off 24 balls with four boundaries, but was caught at square-leg by a diving Michael Hussey off the last ball of the innings. This gave Harwood figures of two for 57, the best of the innings. Johnson finished with two for 59.         
	Australia were below-par in the field, dropping three catches.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Roger hails wife Mirka for success
                                                   Roger hails wife Mirka for success
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                                  Roger Federer with Mirka		      
	Roger Federer, who came from two sets down to beat Tommy Haas, believes his staggering success may have eluded him if it were not for his wife Mirka. The couple, who met at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, married in April and are expecting their first child in the summer.         
	Before that, Federer could win a maiden French Open title and pull level with Pete Samprass record of winning 14 Grand Slam crowns.         
	As Mirka Vavrinec, Federers wife was a regular player on the womens tour until serious injury pushed her out of the game.         
	In the long term, thats been to his benefit. She helped me considerably, as a person. I developed faster, grew faster with her. Thanks to her I was very calm in the important moments in my career. She is always supportive. I owe her a lot, said Federer.         
	His wife is a regular spectator at matches and will be watching from the sidelines on Wednesday when he takes on Gael Monfils for a place in the semi-finals at Roland Garros.         
	She will also be there should he prevail on Sunday and become only the sixth man in history to win all four Grand Slams.         
	Many in the game believe the shock defeat of four-time champion Rafael Nadal, who had defeated Federer in the last three finals, has cleared the path for the Swiss to finally achieve his lifetime dream.         
	But his wife, plus the rest of his back-up crew, are not putting the pressure on him.         
	Mirka and the others have not come to me saying: Now you have to win this match, otherwise you will never do it, ever.         
	Federer lost to Nadal in each of the past three finals and in the 2005 semi-finals, but the Spaniards 31-match winning streak at the clay-court major tournament ended Sunday against Robin Soderling.         
	Youre aware of it, Federer said. Definitely changes it up, if I were to make the final. But were not there yet, so honestly it hasnt changed a whole lot for me.         
	Federer now tries to reach the semi-finals at a 20th Grand Slam event in a row, which would extend his own record, when he meets 11th-seeded Gael Monfils of France, a 6-4, 6-2, 6-3 winner over No. 6 Andy Roddick. Federer is 4-0 against Monfils, including a victory in the semi-final here a year ago.         
	Federer has won 13 major championships, one shy of Sampras record. With Nadal, Roddick and No. 4 Novak Djokovic all gone, Federer is the only man left with a Grand Slam title. For a lot of players, Federer said, I think it must be quite a big opportunity, and their heads must be spinning right now.         
	There are two ways to look at what Nadals loss means for Federer. A potential obstacle is out of the way. And now Federer is expected to win the title, which could be a burden.         
	Consider: Dating to 2005, Federer is 0-4 against Nadal at the French Open, 27-0 against everyone else. It kicks the door open for Roger, but suddenly: Yeah, step up. Now the pressures really on, three-time French Open champion Mats Wilander said.

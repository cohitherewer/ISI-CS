  -   Bengal beat Baroda to set up final date with Tamil Nadu

	Calcutta/Agartala: Disciplined bowling and fielding helped Bengal beat Baroda by 81 runs to move into the final of the National One-dayers for the Vijay Hazare Trophy on Friday..         
	This was Bengals second consecutive entry into the title-round. They had lost to Saurashtra last year.         
	Bengal will face Tamil Nadu in the final on Monday.         
	The batsmens performance didnt justify captain Laxmi Ratan Shuklas decision to bat first as they were bundled out for a modest 227. Wriddhiman Saha once again fell cheaply for 8. But, Sreevats Goswami (41 off 65 balls, 4x5) and Dibyendu Chakraborty (28) held fort to add 69 runs for the second wicket.         
	However, it was the efforts of Manoj Tiwary and Shukla, each scoring 49, which bolstered the Bengal card. Shukla played a restrained knock to lend stability to the batting.         
	While Tiwarys 52-ball innings was studded with six fours, Shukla took 78 deliveries and four boundaries to reach 49.         
	Bengal were well placed at 165 for three in the 37th over, but lost Tiwary and Debabrata Das in consecutive deliveries and could only manage 62 more runs from there on. Rajesh Pawar grabbed three for 59.         
	Barodas chase never really took off as the West Zone team lost four wickets for only 47 within 17 overs. Their batsmen never really settled down and they kept losing wickets at regular intervals. Ranadeb Bose struck with the first ball of the Baroda innings castling K. Devdhar. Boses second victim was Bilakhia Azharuddin in the seventh over.         
	Shukla performed brilliantly with the ball as well returning with impressive figures of three for 33. Avik Chowdhury chipped in efficiently scalping two for 34.         
	Wriddhiman also exhibited some good work behind the wickets to hasten Barodas downfall.         
	At 76 for eight, Baroda were already looking down the barrel. Spinner Iresh Saxena completed the formalities picking up the remaining two wickets of Pawar and M. Vahora as Baroda were bowled out for 146. In fact, it was Pawars 43 down the order that provided the Baroda scorecard with some semblance of respectability.

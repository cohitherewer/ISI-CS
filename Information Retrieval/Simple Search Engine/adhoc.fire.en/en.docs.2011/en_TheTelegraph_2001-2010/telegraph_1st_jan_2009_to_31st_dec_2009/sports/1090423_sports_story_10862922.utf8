The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spinners exploits   surprise Harbhajan
                                                     Spinners exploits   surprise Harbhajan
                  Harbhajan                           
	Durban: Slow bowlers success in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) in South African conditions has proved wrong the perception that Twenty20 cricket was not meant for tweakers, feels Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh.         
	When this concept (IPL) was in the pipeline the biggest threat was to the existence of the spinners as the format was not meant to be spinner supportive. To be more precise, the format was thought as the killer to the art of spin bowling. But look how it has taken a 360 degree turn for our creed. Now the spinning section of the team plays the pivotal role in Twenty20 cricket, the 28-year old Harbhajan wrote on his blog.         
	Interestingly, in the first few days of the IPL, spinners have already played a significant role for their respective teams on the fast and bouncy pitches of South Africa. Anil Kumble, Shane Warne, Daniel Vettori and Harbhajan himself  have posed serious problems for the opposition batsmen.         
	Undoubtedly Indias leading spinner at the moment, after Anil Kumbles retirement last year, the 28-year-old off-spinner is still in awe of Kumble and Shane Warnes ability of spinning a web around the best batsmen in the world.         
	Here I would surely like to mention the performance by Anil bhai (Kumble). Its nearly impossible to make out that this man hasnt bowled for a while. The last time I saw him bowling was with a broken finger in Delhi, where afterwards he proudly walked into the cricketing sunset. Though he bowled after a long break, but the bounce, the accuracy, the intensity and the zeal were the same. The five-wicket haul, shelling out just five runs is no joke in any format, forget about T20, Harbhajan said.         
	He also heaped praise on Warne and said that to see the Aussiess magic with the ball, after nearly two years of his retirement, is unbelievable.         
	And how could I proceed without appreciating the undaunting efforts of Shane Warne. You really need to pinch yourself to believe that he can still spin web around the best of the batsmen in the world.         
	He retired after the 2007 World Cup and now spends more time on Poker table than cricket pitches. But give him a ball and the magic resumes. He can still spin big and land the ball in right areas. Leg spin is a difficult art, but they make it look so easy. Thats why I call them Dada cricketers, and I have learnt a lot from them, Harbhajan added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ranatunga impressed by India
                                                   Ranatunga impressed by India
                      
	Colombo: Highly impressed with Mahendra Singh Dhonis boys and their brand of attacking cricket, former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga said India have never played better here.         
	They have never played better here, Ranatunga said paying tribute to what he termed the vision of the Indian cricket administrators.         
	Their planning is good and they have set goals in their mind, Ranatunga said.         
	India have already taken a 4-0 lead in the five-match series against Sri Lanka and the final match is scheduled here Sunday.         
	Dismissing notions that he had problems with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) during his 11-month tenure as chief of Sri Lanka Cricket, Ranatunga said, I had excellent relations with (former BCCI president) Mr (Sharad) Pawar and (current BCCI president) Mr Shashank Manohar, Ranatunga said.         
	Ranatunga said he remained unimpressed by Twenty20 and believed Indian stars like Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid struggled in Sri Lanka last year because of too much Twenty20.         
	On Sri Lankas poor form, Ranatunga said the administrators were also to blame for the debacle. Insisting that the administrators should have ensured the players maintained their focus, Ranatunga said: This is due to unwanted and unprofessional people entering cricket administration.         
	Never a fan of the Indian Premier League (IPL), Ranatunga also questioned the Sri Lankan players commitment to the nation.         
	Players must answer the question: which is greater  your country, your parents or the money? asked Ranatunga, referring to the players refusal to tour England in May in order to play in the IPL.         
	He felt Sri Lankan players were talented enough but the batting was not clicking at the moment.           (PTI)

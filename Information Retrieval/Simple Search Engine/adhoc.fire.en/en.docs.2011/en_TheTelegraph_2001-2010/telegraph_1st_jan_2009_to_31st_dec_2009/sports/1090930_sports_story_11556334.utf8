The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Smith and Arthur safe for now
                                                   Smith and Arthur safe for now
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Cricket South Africa (CSA) has no plans to fire captain Graeme Smith or coach Mickey Arthur, following their early exit from the Champions Trophy, but wants to dig deep into the debacle.         
	CSA chief executive Gerald Majola said that South Africas loss to England in their final Champions Trophy group match in Centurion on Sunday was deeply disappointing.         
	There are some hard questions to be answered, Majola told a South African daily.         
	At no stage did the team look anything like a team that is the world No.1 in both Tests and one-day Internationals.         
	They certainly were way off where they should be at this stage, and I will be speaking to Mickey and the team management to find out what went wrong.         
	But Majola made it clear that there were no plans at this stage to fire either the captain or the coach.         
	Thats not going to happen, but we definitely want answers. The teams performance was just not good enough.         
	I dont want to pick out individuals, but there were problems with the bowling and the batting, and the teams body language was not that of the worlds best team.         
	South Africa lost to Sri Lanka in the opening match of the tournament but bounced back to beat New Zealand comfortably.         
	Smith, who made a career-best 141 in a losing cause on Sunday, was visibly disappointed after the match. I dont want to make excuses, he said.

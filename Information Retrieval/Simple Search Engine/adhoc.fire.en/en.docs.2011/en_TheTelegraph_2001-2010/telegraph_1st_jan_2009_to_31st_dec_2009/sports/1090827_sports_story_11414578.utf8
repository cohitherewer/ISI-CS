                                                   Subhas: Bhutia not mature yet
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick Wednesday said it was not necessary to take India skipper Bhaichung Bhutias every word seriously. Bhowmick was reacting to Bhaichungs comments that he was surprised by Indian coaches reluctance to obtain the Asian Football Confederation (AFC)s A license.         
	In the present Indian football context, Bhaichung is an icon. Youngsters idolise him. Still, keeping all that in mind, I would say that Bhaichung is yet to mature as a person. Otherwise he would not have made such a sweeping statement. People say you mature when you are 40 thats when you gain in experience. I must say he is yet to reach that stage, Bhowmick said.         
	Incidentally, Bhaichung is one of Bhowmicks assets for the coming season.         
	It might be recalled that the AFC had asked the AIFF to make it mandatory for I-League coaches to have an AFC A licence and had set an August 31 deadline for the same.         
	Failure to meet the deadline would see the I-League being denied professional recognition, a consequence of which is that the Indian teams would not be allowed to participate in the AFC Champions League. Bhowmick has every reason to react since he is the only I-League coach without any coaching licence.         
	Meanwhile, Bhowmick said he was satisfied with the teams performance in their recently-concluded tour of Myanmar. We played four matches over eight days and the boy responded well to the challenge. We are at the peak of our fitness, he said.

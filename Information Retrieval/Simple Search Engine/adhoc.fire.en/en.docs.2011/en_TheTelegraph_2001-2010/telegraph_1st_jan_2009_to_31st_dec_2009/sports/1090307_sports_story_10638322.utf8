The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Taufel has a session with police
                                                     Taufel has a session with police
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              Simon Taufel                           
	Calcutta: Simon Taufel, the International Cricket Councils umpire of the year for the last five years, spent much of Friday being debriefed by a team of Australias Federal Police officers.         
	The session was held in Sydney, where Taufel is based.         
	Taufel had been in the match officials vehicle which too came under attack near the Gaddafi in Lahore on Tuesday morning.         
	The vehicles driver, Zaffir, got killed and fourth umpire Ahsan Raza had to be hospitalised with serious injuries.         
	Im willing to help any investigation... Cricket, which is my livelihood, has taken a big hit and Im obliged to do all I can to get it back on track Its such a great sport, Taufel told The Telegraph from his residence.         
	The 38-year-old added: If the Federal Police so wishes, Ill be available for another round of questions... I suppose fellow-Australian (umpire) Steve Davis will also have a debriefing session.         
	Both Taufel and Davis returned to Australia on Thursday, questioning (and condemning) the appalling level of security provided to them and the other match officials.         
	According to Taufel, Match Referee Chris Broad is likely to be involved in a similar exercise with the UKs Metropolitan Police.         
	Taufel, incidentally, said that he and his family (particularly wife Helen) would undergo counselling by professionals next week. The Taufels have three children  Harry, Jack and Sophie.         
	Umpire-turned-official Peter Manuel, who too was with Taufel and the rest, also intends going in for counselling.         
	Counselling for the Sri Lanka cricketers has already started.

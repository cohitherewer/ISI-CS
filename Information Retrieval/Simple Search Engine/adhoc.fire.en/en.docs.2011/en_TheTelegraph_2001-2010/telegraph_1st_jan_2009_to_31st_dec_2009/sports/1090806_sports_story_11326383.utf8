    - KNIGHTS CAPTAINCY ISSUE 
  -  SHAH RUKH KHAN IS AUTHORING THE SCRIPT             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sourav Ganguly                                 
	Calcutta: Unless theres a twist in the tale being zealously scripted by principal owner Shah Rukh Khan, Sourav Ganguly will be back as the Kolkata Knight Riders captain.         
	Theres hardly ever a 100 per cent scenario, but its 99 per cent certain that Sourav is going to get back the captaincy... The announcement, though, may not be made till a decision has also been taken on the structure of the coaching staff and the personnel coming on board, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	After two very poor years on the field, the Knights need to make an impression in 2010, the IPLs third edition (expected to be held between March 10-April 20), otherwise the sponsors, thus far charmed by Shah Rukh, could start to back out.         
	Speaking on Wednesday, a day after the Knights team director, Joy Bhattacharjya, declared Sourav will be involved in the role of a mentor, whether he is captain or not, the well-placed source added: I dont think too much should be read into the or not bit of what was said... Today, theres only a one per cent chance of Sourav not getting back the top job.         
	That Shah Rukh is moving towards reinstating Sourav, whod been sacked (at John Buchanans behest) before this years IPL, was reported in these columns on July 26. Hed been succeeded by Brendon McCullum.         
	McCullum, who seems to be in a hurry to captain the Black Caps, wont be available for much of the third edition, thanks to Australias tour of New Zealand.         
	As of now, 2010 is going to be Souravs last year with the Knights. As with the icons of the other franchises, he has a three-year contract.         
	Meanwhile, the Knights management is set to invite around 10 candidates for interviews before deciding on the structure of the coaching staff. Calls will be made to a significant number of Indians.         
	The Knights may have a director of cricket with a coach directly below him... At the same time, I feel a straight-forward coach and assistant coach scenario is possible...         
	Whatever the structure, nobody is going to come on board unless he confirms spending an adequate amount of time with the franchise... Moreover, his schedule will be dictated by the availability of the players and not his own convenience, the well-placed source pointed out.         
	Buchanan, who had a phenomenal record as Australias coach, definitely had other things on his plate. Clearly, somebody of his profile wont be wearing the Knights jersey.         
	That should please Sourav even more.         
	Dav Whatmore, incidentally, isnt really in the frame any more as hes currently employed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India and Shah Rukh doesnt wish to be accused of poaching in any manner.         
	More important, perhaps, the Knights principal owner doesnt want to antagonise the promoters of the IPL.

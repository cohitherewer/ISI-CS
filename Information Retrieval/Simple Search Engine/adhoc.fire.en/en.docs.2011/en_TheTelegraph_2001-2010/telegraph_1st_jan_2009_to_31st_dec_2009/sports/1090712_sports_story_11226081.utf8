                                                   Pak aim to level series
                      
	Colombo: Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam says his team have what it takes to bounce back from their unlikely 50-run defeat in the first Test against Sri Lanka earlier this week.         
	The way we lost the first Test match needing 97 with eight wickets in hand is due to bad batting. We have talked about it, weve got to put things right, Intikhab said on Saturday on the eve of the second Test at P. Saravanamuttu stadium, Colombo.

	Birmingham: England coach Andy Flower said a result was still possible in the third Ashes Test against Australia despite rain ensuring no play was possible on the third day Saturday after most of the opening day was also washed out.         
	England, who lead 1-0 in the five-match series, are currently 116 for two in reply to Australias first-innings total of 263 at Edgbaston.         
	With two days left and showers expected on the final two days, more dramatic cricket will be required in a game that saw Australia lose nine wickets for only 137 runs on Friday.         
	Its a shame for everyone that the rain has washed out so much play, Flower said. Looking at the (saturated) outfield, Im not too sure how much play we are going to get in Sunday, maybe 70 overs according to (groundsman) Steve Rouse.         
	But we have seen already here how quickly things can happen in a game. A result is definitely possible. How that happens we will have to see how both sides play. We will have to bat well Sunday and see how far ahead we can get. Weve got two hopefully full-ish days of cricket to come.         
	New Australian opening batsman Shane Watson, who top-scored with 62 but was dismissed on the first ball Friday morning, said his team cannot waste any wicket-taking opportunities and need to be at the top of their game.         
	I think theres a possibility (of a result) but Im not exactly sure how its going to pan out, he said. For us to win, we are going to have to bowl very well to give ourselves a chance.         
	Because we are 1-0 down we cant afford to have too many draws. (AGENCIES)

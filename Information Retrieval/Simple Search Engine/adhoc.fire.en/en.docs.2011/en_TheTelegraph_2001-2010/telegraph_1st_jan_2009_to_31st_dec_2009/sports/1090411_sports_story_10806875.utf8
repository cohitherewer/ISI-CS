                                                   Jeev: Woods made me comfortable
                      
	Augusta: Playing partner Tiger Woods comforting words calmed his nerves as Jeev Milkha Singh regained his composure to card a one-under 71 for a share of the 28th spot after the opening round of the Masters golf tournament here.         
	With large crowds following his group, Jeev conceded he was nervous playing with 14-time major winner Woods and Stewart Cink before a little help from the iconic American and Jeevs own solid play helped him settle down. It was tough when I was starting out and youre a little nervous. But after that it was fine. Tiger was very nice and made me comfortable, Jeev said.         
	Ill try to better the score tomorrow and see what comes my way, said the Indian.         
	Jeev began on a strong note, with a flawless front nine where he birdied the sixth hole from five feet.         
	Things went a little haywire on his way back but to his credit, Jeev never let things go beyond his control.         
	His back nine journey began and ended in similar fashion, with a bogey, and he found the greenside trap on the 10th hole.         
	A glorious three-iron approach set him up for eagle on the par five 13th hole but he failed to build on the momentum, dropping a shot at the next despite having only a nine iron in hand from the middle of the fairway.         
	After a second birdie on the 17th, a wayward drive left him among the pine trees at the last and Jeev failed to save par from the greenside.         
	I shouldnt have gone for the flag on 14. I made a management error there. I was looking at birdie and to move off with a bogey hurts. I got greedy and paid the price, rued Jeev.         
	Still, the Indian felt, it was not too bad to start with a 71. Im pretty happy with the way I played except for the last which left a bad taste in my mouth, Jeev said.         
	Overall, I played pretty good I made a few mistakes on the back nine but its just the first day and well take it from there, said the Asia No.1.         
	Incidentally, Jeevs round of 71 matched his last years first round and the affable Indian went on to finish a commendable tied 25th in his second Masters appearance in 2008.         
	Among Jeevs playing partners, Cink blasted a three-under 69 to lie tied 14th, one shot ahead of Woods who was sharing the 21st place with five others.         
	American Chad Campbell led by a shot after a superb 65, followed by Jim Furyk and Hunter Mahan.         
	While a record 38 players posted sub-par rounds at Augusta National Golf Club and leader Campbell flirted with the lowest round at a major, Woods plodded along in contrast, unperturbed by the results.         
	I was in position. I just didnt make any putts and got fooled a few times on the wind, he told reporters. Overall, Im pleased with the way I hit the golf ball.         
	Generous set-up of tees and pins, and lack of wind helped 38 of the 96-man field break the 1992 record of 35 sub-par scores in an opening round.         
	Woods went out in even-par 36 and appeared to hit his stride with three successive birdies from the par-five 13th. He missed an eight-footer for birdie at the par-three 16th and lipped out a five-foot birdie try on the next.         
	The world No.1, playing his first major in nearly 10 months since having knee surgery after his US Open triumph, then bogeyed the 18th, where his approach shot after a booming drive bounced over the green.         
	It was unbelievable, Woods said about his miscalculation at the last. I hit just a little eight-iron and it flew 155 (yards), uphill.         
	Thats a long way to hit. I thought it was like a little, three-quarter eight-iron. I hit a good shot and it ended up in a bad spot.         
	I let a couple of shots slip away at the end there, Woods said, adding he could have shot four or five under par.         
	Woods shrugged off the missed chances, saying there was plenty of time and opportunity to make up ground.         
	Its a long week, and the weather is going to start changing a little bit here, and youve got to keep patient, stay with it. Its not like I havent been in this position before.         
	I also won it four times.                 (AGENCIES)

	London: Sri Lanka overcame last-minute jitters to beat Bangladesh by four wickets with two balls to spare while the West Indies rode Chris Gayles hurricane unbeaten 88 to a nine-wicket win over Ireland in the warm-up matches on Tuesday.         
	Ricky Ponting struck a 40-ball 56 and Michael Clarke contributed with an unbeaten 38-ball 49 as Australia defeated New Zealand by seven wickets at Kennington Oval. Batting first, New Zealand scored 147 off 19.5 overs with Peter McGlashan (49 off 35 balls) being their highest scorer.         
	Australia reached 151 for three with four balls to spare. For the Aussies, Mitchell Johnson was the star bowler returning figures of four for 20 off his four overs.         
	At Trent Bridge, Kevin Pietersens unbeaten 39-ball 53 saw England score 141 for four with an over to spare in reply to Scotlands 136 for five. Colin Smith top-scored for the Scots with a 32-ball 45.         
	According to Cricinfo, Sri Lanka threatened to squander what appeared an easy chase against a charged-up Bangladesh attack at Trent Bridge. Mahela Jayawardene, with a classy 43, kept his cool after Sri Lankas openers failed to fire but it was left to Chamara Silva and Angelo Mathews to steady the nerves before a wide sealed the match.         
	Batting first on a good track Bangladeshs top-order failed and that put plenty of pressure on Raqib-ul Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim. Bangladesh crossed 150 thanks to their partnership but the bowlers allowed too many runs early in the piece, with Jayawardene playing a big role, and Sri Lanka overcame a few late hiccups to clinch a tense game.         
	Sri Lankas chase started eventfully. After Tillekaratne Dilshan slapped the first ball from Mashrafe Mortaza for four, Sanath Jayasuriya dumped Rubel Hossain for six over deep square leg and got four overthrows next ball. Mortaza came back well in his second over, allowing just one single, and Mahmudullah gave only two singles in his first over, the fourth. Dilshan clubbed Mortaza for two more fours but was yorked in the same over.         
	Jayawardenes controlled hitting kept Sri Lanka in the reach and then cross the asking rate. He reverse-swept, slogged and swept Mahmudullah for 15 in the eighth over even as Jayasuriya was bowled by Shakib Al Hasan for 29. Jayawardene was joined in by Kumar Sangakkara.         
	Bangladesh ensured it wasnt easy. Sangakkara fell trying to go over extra cover, and Jayawardene carelessly edged Rubel to Mushfiqur in a stellar wicket-maiden 14th over. Shakib allowed just one run in the 15th and suddenly Sri Lanka had gone backwards, losing their captain in the space of two runs. Jehan Mubarak and Silva prodded and swept uncertainly in the air and away through the covers as the run-rate inched ahead. Mubarak signalled the charge by launching Mortaza for consecutive fours. Mortaza got Mubarak and Shakib cleaned up Indika de Saram in the 19th over, but Silva and Mathews hung on.         
	At the Oval, Gayle took the opportunity to showcase his power as he led West Indies to a comfortable victory. Chasing 131, Gayle hammered an unbeaten 88 off only 56 balls and the West Indies achieved their target with nine wickets in hand and four overs to spare.         
	Gayle treated the fans to seven sixes, most of which were smashed straight down the ground or over the leg-side boundary. He didnt bother much with singles, hitting six fours to go with his sixes, and the rest of the batsmen only had to stick around while the captain got the job done.         
	Andre Fletcher was the only wicket to fall, top-edging his first ball against Kyle McCallans left-arm spin to short third man. Ramnaresh Sarwan played a steady hand, remaining unbeaten on 25 off 23 balls.

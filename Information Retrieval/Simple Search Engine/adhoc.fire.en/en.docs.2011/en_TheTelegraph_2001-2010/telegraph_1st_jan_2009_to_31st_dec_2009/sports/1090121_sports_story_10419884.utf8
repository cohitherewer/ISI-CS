The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shabbir slams attitude 
                                                   Shabbir slams attitude 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali slammed his players attitude after a humiliating 3-0 loss to Mumbai FC here on Tuesday.         
	A lot has to do with the attitude. We gave away silly goals. Unless we do something about it, it is going to be difficult for us (to stay in the I-League), Shabbir told The Telegraph after the match.         
	We did well in the local league, where again we dont have the points to show, and the Fed Cup. Nobody thought we would lose 1-0 to Churchill (Brothers) and score two goals against Mahindra United (who won 4-2). So it is not as if the talent is not there. But the attitude has to change.         
	We didnt play well at all. We had chances in the first 10 minutes. But then we conceded silly goals. I was not there for two days and we were playing after a long time, but there cannot be any excuse for non-performance.         
	Shabbir made an allowance for the absence of four key players including overseas player Theodore Sunday, whom the club has sought to replace with Eugene Gray, but still believed the team should have done better.         
	The start was good, our marking was sharp. If we had managed to score one goal, it would have been a different story. But then, it (turned out to be) the same old story, he rued.         
	Mumbai FC coach David Booth was a jubilant man after his early substitution of K. Aseem with Abhishek Yadav proved to be a masterstroke.         
	With the way things were going in the start, we decided to substitute early. We were comfortable at the back, so we wanted put some pressure upfront  and we had two goals (in the first half), the Englishman said.

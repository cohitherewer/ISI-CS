	Mumbai: A defiant unbeaten 78 by Orissas Niranjan Behera ensured that Mumbai had to be content with only one point despite a sporting declaration by skipper Wasim Jaffer on the fourth and final day of the Group A Ranji Trophy Super League match at the Brabourne Stadium here Friday.         
	Behera, who retired hurt when on 8 (with the teams score on 80 for 1) returned with the team struggling at 116 for five to deny the hosts, who had declared their first innings at 307 for four, a first innings lead.         
	The one-down batsman first added 68 runs for the sixth wicket with Pravanjan Mullick (50) and then hung on with the tail as the visitors ended at 243 for eight in 81 overs.         
	Behera faced 162 deliveries but more importantly held fort for 226 minutes of the 346 minutes Orissa batted and shielded the tail from pacer Zaheer Khan (3/100) and the impressive Iqbal Abdulla (4/52).

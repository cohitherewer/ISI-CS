	London: New Zealands World Twenty20 campaign faces a potentially make-or-break 24 hours as they wait on the fitness of several senior players.         
	Black Caps captain Daniel Vettori has yet to appear in the tournament because of an injury to the left-arm spinners bowling shoulder and opening batsman Jesse Ryder is struggling with a groin problem.         
	Ryder too didnt feature during Tuesdays last ball loss to South Africa in New Zealands final group match.         
	But middle-order batsman Ross Taylor did play only to suffer what appeared to be a hamstring strain while batting and he too is now doubtful for Thursdays Super Eight opener against Ireland at Trent Bridge.         
	Asked about the extent of Vettori, Ryder and Taylors injuries, captain Brendon McCullum said: Im not too sure, well find out in the next 24 hours whether theyll be available for remainder of the tournament, the next game or not at all.

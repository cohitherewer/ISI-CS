	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan logged full points against Viva Kerala, their first victory following the two defeats in the I-League this season, at the Salt Lake Stadium Monday.         
	Snehasish Chakraborty opened the scoring in the 52nd minute and substitute Manish Mathani rounded off the tally in the third minute of injury time.         
	While the 2-0 scoreline is sure to instil hope and confidence in the Bagan faithful, the performance hardly showcased their potential. True, they were without nine of their frontline players, including Jose Ramirez Barreto, but that could hardly have been reason enough for such an uninspiring performance against a side consisting mostly of amateurs.         
	Karim Bencharifas men should be grateful to Viva Kerala goalkeeper E.C. Sharat whose charlatan approach was responsible for both goals.         
	On the first occasion he failed to grip the ball, and, then, in the dying moments, he showed no urgency to stop Manishs nod thinking the ball would miss the target. That, though, didnt stop Bencharifa from engaging in his favourite pastime, complaining about the standard of refereeing. The coach would do well to shift his attention to minimising the teams mistakes before the Calcutta derby on October 25.         
	Edeh Chidi could have returned with a hattrick had he not squandered at least three gilt-edged opportunities in the first half. The Nigerian never got his act right in the match, and most of Snehasishs enterprising work down the left flank was wasted.         
	Bagan looked listless in the first session with a non-existent midfield and too many square passes in the defensive third. James Singh and Marcos Pereiras hard work, however, bore fruit when Snehasish struck at the start of the second session.         
	Surkumar Singhs 22-yard volley bounced off Sharats hands and Snehasish followed it well to nod it in before the goalkeeper could recover.         
	It was not the only time the visitors second-choice goalie indulged in something comical. Time and again he fisted or merely put the ball out of harms way without gripping it. That had the goalmouth exposed. Bagan introduced Ishfaq Ahmed in the second session in a bid to use his speed against a tired Viva Kerala defence. But the forwards aimless running got the team nowhere.         
	Bagans defensive woes cant be overlooked. On the few occasions the Viva Kerala forwards showed some agility, the rival defenders were caught napping. Not a good omen. Time Bencharifa put his house in order.

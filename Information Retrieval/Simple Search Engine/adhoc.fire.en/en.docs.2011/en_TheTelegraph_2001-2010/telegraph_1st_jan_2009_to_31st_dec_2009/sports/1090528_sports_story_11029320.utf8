The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brendon may choose Otago
                                                   Brendon may choose Otago
                      
	Melbourne: The Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) may have failed to qualify for the inaugural Champions League Twenty20, but skipper Brendon McCullum is in a two-way race to represent his home team Otago Volts instead of the New South Wales of Australia in the tournament scheduled to be held in India in October.         
	After playing for the New South Wales in the Australian Twenty20 final last season, McCullum is eligible to play for both the Sydney side as well as Otago in the Champions League.         
	But as per the regulations of the tournament, if a player is eligible for more than one Champions League team, his overseas side will have to pay his home side a $250,000 as transfer fee to secure his services. Otago chief executive Ross Dykes had confirmed that he had spoken to McCullum, who hinted that he would be playing for his home province.         
	You wont find anyone more passionate about Otago than Brendon, but lets wait and see what happens, there hasnt even been an official offer yet, Dykes was quoted as saying by an Australian daily.         
	New South Wales are also eager to rope in McCullums services after losing their big-hitting batsman David Warner to the Delhi DareDevils for $250,000. There is no doubt having Brendon McCullum in your team increases your chances of a win, that is an undeniable fact, New South Wales chief executive Dave Gilbert said.

                                                   Weve got the team to win: Paul
                      
	Nottingham: England captain Paul Collingwood after a disappointing seven-wicket defeat to the Proteas, has promised to regroup and come hard against India in their next Super Eight match of the ongoing ICC Twenty20 World Cup scheduled Sunday.         
	Its not going to be easy against India. We are in a very tough group but we have the guys to win the next few games and win the tournament, Collingwood said after his sides loss to South Africa Thursday night.         
	We cannot lose any more game now. We have to regroup and come back strong in the next few days, he added.         
	Asked about the disappointing batting performance by his side against the Proteas, Collingwood said: We thought we have sorted out our batting after losing to The Netherlands but it did not. But we will regroup, we have to keep going and think positive ahead of the coming matches.         
	Collingwood admitted that England were comprehensively beaten by a better team.         
	We were beaten by a side which sets standards on the field. We did not get a good start, lost early wickets inside the first six overs. We never had a partnership going. When you are chasing a small total of 110 or so everything falls in place for you (South Africa). No doubt, they batted well but the wicket was still good to bat, Collingwood pointed.         
	Meanwhile, South Africa captain Graeme Smith was delighted with the high on-field intensity maintained by his players.         
	We had a great time on the field and every bowler did their job. The intensity on the field was great, Smith said.         
	West Indies are a tough side and we play them on Saturday. So there is not much time left but we are enjoying our cricket and hopefully continue the same on Saturday also, he added.         
	Smith lavished praise on young left-arm pacer Wayne Parnells performance against England. Parnell took three wickets giving away 14 runs.         
	He is a superb prospect for us. He has just come in but has showed great composure and control in his bowling. The crowd was against us but despite that he hung on and came up with a superb performance. That is a credit to him and to the team also, Smith said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sri Lanka in box seat
                                                   Sri Lanka in box seat
                      
	Galle: Thilan Thushara and Muttiah Muralidharan shared six wickets as Sri Lanka seized control of the first Test against New Zealand on Thursday, reducing the visitors first innings to 281 for eight at stumps on Day III.         
	Resuming the day on 87 for two, the Black Caps played Muralidharan and his spin partner Ajantha Mendis creditably in the rain-shortened opening session, losing only night watchman Jeetan Patel (26) before going to lunch on 137 for three.         
	After lunch, Muralidharan got a leg before decision against opener Tim McIntosh, who had scored a painstaking 69 off 226 balls in nearly five hours at the crease.         
	Thushara provided two further wickets in the middle session to hamper the visitors effort to match Sri Lankas first innings score of 452.         
	He elicited an edge from Ross Taylor (35) to wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene and then bowled Brendon McCullum (1). When Jacob Oram went for 12, New Zealand were in some danger of following on, but Jesse Ryder made 42 and added 36 runs for the eighth wicket with his captain Daniel Vettori.         
	Vettori was batting on 33 at close with Iain Brien on 3.         
	Muralidharan returned the best figures of three for 66 while Thushara recorded three for 80.         
	Muralidharan surpassed Shane Warne by bowling the highest number of maiden overs in Tests. Muralidharan, playing in his 128th Test, overtook Warne by bowling his 1762nd maiden. Warne has bowled 1761 maidens.           (AGENCIES)

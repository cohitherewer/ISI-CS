                                                     Kumble in ICC clause panel
            A STAFF REPORTER            Kumble                           
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) Thursday formed a five-member panel to look into the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)s concerns about the whereabouts clause of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada)s code.         
	The panel includes former India Test captain Anil Kumble, BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan and ICC principal advisor I.S. Bindra. Tim Kerr, the chairman of the ICCs anti-doping panel, will head the International Registered Testing Pool (IRTP) working group that also includes ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat.         
	Lorgat formed the panel to resolve the BCCIs concerns about the implementation of the whereabouts requirements of the elite international players selected in the IRTP, so that such players are able to comply in full, the ICC said in a statement.         
	Even though nothing was finalised about the panels first meeting, the group would report back to the ICC board at the earliest possible opportunity, the statement said.         
	Incidentally, Kumble is the cricketer representative on Wadas Athlete Committee as well.         
	Kumble was happy to be part of the panel and he said he hoped to find a solution to the issue. Its good to be part of the working group and to try and understand what the issues are and resolve them and move forward, Kumble said.         
	BCCI president Shashank Manohar hailed the move and said: The BCCI is a willing partner in this process because the objectives of ICC and BCCI are identical regarding cricket as a clean and drug-free sport, and we will resolve the issues amicably.         
	I am pleased we have constituted this group as I believe it will help to resolve the practical concerns of Indian players, Lorgat said.         
	All of us  the ICC and its members including India  are committed to a zero-tolerance approach in the area of anti-doping but what we have to do is to satisfy the India players on the practical implementation of the new Wada rules on whereabouts, Lorgat said.         
	The constitution of the IRTP working group follows the BCCIs decision on Sunday that it would not force its players to file whereabouts information.         
	Manohar explained that decision on the basis that the BCCI considered the requirement to be an invasion of the players privacy, a risk to their security and a breach of their constitutional rights to privacy under the Indian Constitution.

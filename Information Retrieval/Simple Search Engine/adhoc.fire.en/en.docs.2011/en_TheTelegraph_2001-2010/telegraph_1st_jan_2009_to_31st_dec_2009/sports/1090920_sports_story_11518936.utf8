The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhupathi injury hurts India
                                                   Bhupathi injury hurts India
            OUR CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Mumbai/Johannesburg: Indias Davis Cup hopes suffered a serious setback when the visitors were forced to concede the doubles rubber in the World Group playoff against South Africa due to an injury to Mahesh Bhupathi, in Johannesburg Saturday.         
	The Indians had fought their way back into the game to win the second set after having lost the first, but the hosts had taken a 4-0 lead in the third when Bhupathi retired.         
	Bhupathi injured his right groin while attempting a high backhand volley in the second game of the third set. The 35-year-old Bangalorean, who reached the final of the US Open last week, looked in obvious discomfort as he could barely get his serve over the net and served two double faults before retiring.         
	Captain Shiv Prakash Misra was philosophical about the defeat.         
	You cant help with such injuries. Things were at par when it happened and that took the wind out of our sails, Misra told The Telegraph from Johannesburg.         
	India went into the match 2-0 up, having won singles matches on Friday. But the doubles loss has allowed the hosts to get a foot in the door.         
	Misra said Bhupathis was a recurrent injury, one that might keep the tennis ace off the courts for at least three weeks.         
	He suffered the same injury in May (earlier this year) and was out for three weeks then, Misra added. After the injury he couldnt serve or volley.         
	However, Misra said Somdev and Bopanna are raring to go for the reverse singles and book India a berth in the World Group after 11 years.         
	Misra hinted that if India wins the tie after the first match, Yuki Bhambri can make his Davis Cup debut.         
	We will see how it goes, but it could happen.         
	Coetzee and Moodie were a little surprised at Bhupathis retirement but they did suspect something was wrong in the fourth game of the third set. It was only when he (Bhupathi) started serving that I noticed something was up, Moodie was quoted as saying on the tournament website.         
	Coetzee said: I thought they were trying different tactics. I couldnt understand why he (Bhupathi) was serving and staying back.         
	The duo said this wasnt how they wanted to win the tie, but Coetzee added: A wins a win. And I am just glad we could give our singles guys another chance.         
	The twist in the tale means focus is back on Somdev Dev Varman who is scheduled to play the first reverse singles against Rik de Voest, the hosts No.1 player, on Sunday.         
	A lot will depend on Somdev. I expect him to pull us through. He is the favourite against De Voest, Misra said.         
	Bopanna was drawn to play the final rubber against Izak van der Merwe but the Indian captain predicted that the hosts could change their nomination should the tie go down to the wire.         
	I am still hoping Somdev can pull it off because they (South Africa) may replace Van der Merwe with (Wesley) Moodie. We are keeping our eyes open, Misra said.         
	Meanwhile, Somdev said it is South Africa who will be under pressure as they have to win both the matches Sunday.         
	I am ready for my match against Rik. The pressure is still on SA. I hope to finish the job off tomorrow. We know each others game well as we train together and share the same coach, Somdev said.         
	Thirty-year-old Moodie has been focusing on doubles in recent years (world ranking of nine and winner at Wimbledon in 2005) but is no chicken when it comes to singles either, having ranked as high as No. 57 four years ago.         
	On the other hand, Van der Merwe is four years younger to Bopanna and has a ranking of No.290.

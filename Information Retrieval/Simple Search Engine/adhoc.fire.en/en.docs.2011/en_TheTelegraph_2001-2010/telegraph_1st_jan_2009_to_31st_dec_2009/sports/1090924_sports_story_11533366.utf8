                                                     Tennis missed Henins grace 
            IAN CHADBAND            Justine Henin with her pet dog at Limelette in Belgium on Wednesday. (AP)                           
	This is evidently the year of sporting renaissance. Michael Schumacher, sadly, did not quite get around to completing the set but, from Lance Armstrong to Kieren Fallon to Kim Clijsters to Floyd Mayweather Jr, sports absent friends came back, saw and conquered.         
	Armstrong had three years out of the most demanding sport of the lot and still returned to finish third in the Tour de France at 37; earlier this month, Fallon was back riding a winner just a day after jumping back into the saddle following his 18-month ban.         
	Then last weekend, Mayweather offered a ring masterclass against Juan Manuel Marquez, boxing even more brilliantly than in his last bout against Ricky Hatton 21 months earlier.         
	And when, less than a couple of weeks ago, Clijsters, with baby in tow, proved herself good enough to win the US Open in her third tournament back after a two-year break, the message about the permanence of sporting class  and its potential rewards  could hardly have been spelt out more tantalisingly to her compatriot.         
	If Kim could do it, then so could her nemesis in all those old Slam finals. Henin has been away for a shorter period than any of these other comeback artists. She is rested, reignited, rejuvenated and still only 27, a leopard re-entering a field populated by far too many lambs. Of course, she will be a success again; put your money on her for the Australian Open now. The Womens Tennis Association (WTA) must hardly be able to credit its luck.         
	Looking for a way out from stagnation, running a Tour short on star quality while long on one-dimensional games and Serena Williamss faceless ovas, they wait for ages to rediscover a famous Belgian and, lo, two turn up together.         
	It is not that Clijsters and Henin were natural-born, charismatic superstar material. They never were, probably never will be. Indeed, there was much more wailing last year when Maria Sharapova disappeared from the scene for months through injury than when Henin, described by John McEnroe as one of the greatest players ever seen on a tennis court, retired.         
	But that in itself told you much about the womens game; it is still perceived to be as much about glamour as real achievement. It is why, outside the game, Henins excellence was perhaps never appreciated enough. Well now it really could be.         
	These 16 months since she quit have only shown how badly the womens game has missed a dominant champion. Henin was the games last unarguable No 1, holding the spot for 117 weeks between November 2006 and May 2008, apart from a brief interruption from Sharapova.         
	Yet in the 16 months which have followed, the honour has been passed around with such abandon, on average once every two months, that the position has almost been held up to disrepute.         
	No one can quite fathom how the latest holder, Dinara Safina, has clung on for five months, during which time she was destroyed in the French Open final, humiliated by Venus Williams in the Wimbledon semis and knocked out by a Czech teenager, Petra Kvitova, in just the third round of the US Open.         
	That is why the game needs Clijsters and Henin. In just one fortnight in New York, Clijsters, reinvented as supermum, managed to re-energise the sport.         
	Yet Henins return is even better news. As a personality she may not have been particularly missed; but the personality in her superb all-round tennis certainly has been. Amid the dreary landscape of double-fisted automatons, it is going to be a delight again to see her lovely athletic throwback of a game, that classic speed and grace, that dreamy backhand, those artful demonstrations that power does not have to be all-powerful.         
	McEnroe said of Henin after she had beaten Serena at Wimbledon two years ago: She lost her mother, was estranged from her father, her brother had a serious car accident and shes recently divorced. But she still played great. Shes the Roger Federer of the womens game.         
	Thats why, of all the sports to benefit from the return of their comeback champs, tennis may just be getting the best deal of all.

                                                     PCB brass passing the buck
    - Responsible for distribution, Manager may have to pay for shirt fiasco           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI    
	Calcutta: With unsubstantiated charges on the match-fixing issue and denials flying thick and fast across the Arabian Sea, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) brass has been caught in much turbulence.         
	Not that its hands werent full with problems related to the 2011 World Cup and the refusal of nations to play in Pakistan.         
	Just as bad has been the PCBs own bungling which resulted in the absence of premier sponsor Pepsis logo from the shirts worn in the first two ODIs of the ongoing series in Sri Lanka.         
	The cola majors association with the PCB goes back many years and it has, understandably, taken very strong exception.         
	Till Thursday evening, however, nobody in the PCB had taken responsibility for the fiasco.         
	Everybody is passing the buck, is what one source told The Telegraph from Lahore, adding that no effort was being made to hold somebody accountable.         
	The bungling started with the UK-based manufacturer which, apparently, has sub-contracted a firm in Sialkot. Then, not one person checked the consignment in Lahore, where the PCB is headquartered. Finally, manager Yawar Saeed didnt give the shirts a look in Sri Lanka either.         
	Having been last in the chain and responsible for the shirts distribution, Saeed may have to pay for this as also for his flip-flop on the bookies issue.         
	Hes 74 and, if Intikhab Alam (67) is the oldest coach around, then Saeed is No. 1 in his category.         
	Saeed, who has managed many Pakistan teams in the past, made a comeback after Ejaz Butt became the PCB chairman in the latter half of 2008.         
	Strangely, even Pepsi woke up after the second ODI.         
	The change in shirts, though, didnt bring about a change in fortunes  Younis Khan and Co. trail 0-3 in the five-match face-off, having already been defeated in the Test series.         
	Incidentally, the new shirts were readied within hours and sent to Colombo with the Pakistan A teams management. From there, the consignment was driven to Dambulla, which hosted the first three ODIs.         
	The fourth ODI is in Colombo on Friday. The series will end on Sunday.         
	Its possible that Pepsi will deduct a percentage from their sponsorship and, if that happens, the cash-strapped PCB could cut the logo money given to its players... Of course, in that eventuality, the players wont take it lying down, for its not their fault that the logo wasnt there, another source, based in Karachi, said.         
	One more controversy, then, probably isnt far away.         
	The logo money is paid annually, with a gradation system being followed by the PCB. Somebody like Younis gets around Rs 1.1 crore, with the juniors pocketing something in the region of Rs 25 lakh.

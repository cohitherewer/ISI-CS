The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bright start for Chirag United
                                                                                                                                     Bright start for Chirag United
            A STAFF REPORTER            Chirag Uniteds Soumik Chakraborty attempts to go past BNR goalkeeper Ganesh Singh, at the Barasat Stadium, on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Chirag United began their CFL Premier division campaign with a 2-0 win over BNR at the Barasat Stadium on Tuesday.         
	Lalkamal Bhowmick scored the first from the spot in the 6th minute and the second came at the very fag end when, in the 90th minute, midfielder Gouranga Duttas shot hit the post and a hapless Shyam Mondal, instead of clearing the ball, helped it on its way home.         
	Referee Minangshu Bhattacharya, however, ruled Gouranga to have scored the goal.         
	The first goal was straightforward. P.C. Lalwampuiya, Lalkamal and Parveen Kumar exchanged passes amongst themselves before the latter was fouled by BNR captain Akhil Rajbanshi inside the box.         
	Lalkamal stepped up to take the penalty and easily beat keeper Ganesh Singh.         
	After the 0-2 loss to Churchill Brothers in the last match, in the I-League, and with a few players sitting out with injuries, Chirag needed the win to boost their morales. Man of the Match Eduardo put it simply: It was really needed.         
	BNR striker Babatunde bothered the Chirag defence on numerous occasions but missed sitters meant that his team tasted defeat for the first time in the CFL.         
	Chirags new under-19 player, Ram Malik, too was guilty of profligacy, missing at least three easy attempts in the second-half.         
	Despite the victory, Chirag coach Subrata Bhattacharya was not a happy man. How will the CFL succeed if such a routine is followed, whereby both leagues are on at the same time?         
	Teams         
	Chirag United: Sandip Nandy, Kingshuk Debnath (Sukhen Dey, 39), Safar Sardar (Arnab Mondal, 45), Eduardo, Dhanarajan R, Gouranga Dutta, Lalkamal Bhowmick, Denson Devadas, Ram Malik, Lalwampuiya (Soumik Chakraborty, 67), Parveen Kumar.         
	BNR: Ganesh Singh, Rajib Ghouri (Sanat Dilali, 85), Akhil Rajbanshi, Shyam Mondal, Sukanta Banerjee, Mathan Buchi (I. Zuala 59), Mithun Naha (Pratim Sarkar, 82), Dhiman Sinha, Mohan Sarkar, Ashim Das, Babatunde         
	Referee: Minangshu Bhattacharya         
	MoM: Eduardo

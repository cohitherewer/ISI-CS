The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Avik is not yet out of danger
                                                     Avik is not yet out of danger
            OUR BUREAU            Avik Chowdhury                           
	Calcutta: Avik Chowdhurys condition has improved but the cricketer, who had been critically injured in a car crash Sunday afternoon, is not yet out of danger.         
	The internal bleeding from both sides of his chest has stopped. The blood pressure and the oxygen saturation in his blood have also become normal. These are signs that he is responding to the treatment. But he is still not out of danger, said S.B. Purakayastha, the CEO of Ruby Hospital on Monday.         
	Our first priority is to save his life. The lower part of his body is paralysed and we cannot conduct any tests or surgery until he is out of ventilation, Purakayastha added.         
	Meanwhile, in a noble gesture, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) announced Monday that they will foot Chowdhurys medical expenses. We are giving him our full support and will ensure he gets the best treatment, CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya said. From what we have come to know, there has been no further deterioration in his condition. That gives us some hope, Dalmiya added.         
	State sports minister Kanti Ganguly also promised financial help to the cricketer.         
	On Monday evening, city-based neurosurgeon Dr. L.N. Tripathi examined Chowdhury. There had been talk of flying in specialists from outside the city but hospital officials ruled that out, at least for the time being.         
	Thats because Chowdhury cannot be moved even an inch. Thats why even an MRI scan could not be done, a hospital source added. Avik has three fractured vertebrae.         
	Unconfirmed reports said that Chowdhury had been lying on the road for some time before anyone approached to provide assistance. Purakayastha said the Bengal cricketer was admitted to the hospital within an hour of the accident. If an accident victim is treated within an hour of the mishap, chances of survival are always high.         
	According to hospital sources, a team of six doctors  including two neurosurgeons, an orthopaedic surgeon, a general surgeon, a critical care medicine specialist and an anaesthetist  are handling Chowdhurys case.         
	Arindam Ghosh has replaced the 24-year-old in the Bengal squad for the East Zone T20 tournament in Dhanbad. The squad leaves Tuesday.

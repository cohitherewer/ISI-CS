                                                   Meeting ends in   23 minutes only
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The contract row between the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) and the players association continued as talks between both the parties, on Thursday, ended after just 23 minutes when the board refused to negotiate.         
	The WICBs negotiating team met the West Indies Players Association (WIPA) after the players, who have not been offered contract for four successive series, boycotted the fifth unpaid series, against Bangladesh.         
	WICB impressed upon WIPA that it was not prepared, consistent with good industrial relations practices, to negotiate under duress, and insisted that before any good faith negotiations commenced, the players strike would first have to end, said WICB in a statement.

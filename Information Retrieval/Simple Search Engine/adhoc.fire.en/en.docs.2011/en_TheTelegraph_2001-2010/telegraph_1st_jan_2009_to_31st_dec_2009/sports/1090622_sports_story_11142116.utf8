The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dj vu for Somdev on Big W debut
                                                   Dj vu for Somdev on Big W debut
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: There is a sense of dj vu for Somdev Dev Varman as he gets ready for his Grand Slam debut at Wimbledon.         
	Dev Varman and South African Kevin Anderson take on Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles in the mens doubles first round. Earlier this year, in the company of Prakash Amritraj, the Assam-born 24-year-old had lost against the same opponents at the Chennai Open.         
	I am ready and excited. We have a very tough match first up, so just preparing for it in the best possible way, Dev Varman told The Telegraph on Sunday.         
	Dev Varman is not overawed at being up against his senior compatriot and a multiple Grand Slam champion.         
	Well, I am always motivated no matter who is across the net. Playing against them in Chennai was a good learning curve. I hope we can execute our plans on the match court, he said.         
	Dev Varman and Anderson made it to the main draw after coming through two qualifying rounds but the Indian, ranked 132, lost in the first round of the singles qualifying. That 3-6, 2-6 loss to Jean-Rene Lisnard of Monaco, who hit a career high of 84 a few years back, was his third successive first-round loss on grass this season.         
	It wasnt my best match, but I must give Lisnard credit for the way he played. I just need to play more on grass to garner experience on this surface, he said.         
	Halfway through his first full season on the Tour, Dev Varmans singles results have not matched the expectations stemming from his stupendous show at the Chennai Open. Although his ranking has kept going up, he has suffered stunning reverses against lower-ranked players on the Challenger circuit.         
	Dev Varman acknowledged he had to lift his game but believed things were not all that wrong. My form hasnt been the best of late, though I feel I am still hitting the ball well and working hard. I just need a couple of wins in succession to turn it around, he said.         
	Rankings at that level can be very deceptive. You have to look at the individuals quality and not his ranking. Having said that, I feel my own game hasnt been at its sharpest best and I am working hard to get back on track.

                                                                                                                       7                                        Schumi signs for Mercedes 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Schumacher                           
	Michael Schumacher has returned to Formula One racing. The German has signed a one-year contract to drive in 2010 with Mercedes GP, ending three years in retirement. The announcement comes 11 days ahead of Schumachers 41st birthday on January 3, easily making him the oldest driver in next years championship.         
	Schumacher said: The motivation is pretty straight forward. I got a call from Ross (Brawn, team principal) at the beginning of November asking me to race again, telling me Mercedes were going to be involved.         
	Ive never left the race track, and after three years I regained the energy Im feeling now. After playing around on motorbikes, Im ready for the serious stuff.         
	Schumacher was poised to make a comeback with Ferrari in the summer to fill in for the injured Felipe Massa, but had to back out because of a neck injury which he now insists is not a problem. Before giving the final okay, I had to make sure my neck was okay, he said. It wasnt okay in the summer, but its had the time to heal completely.         
	Wednesdays news finally ends the speculation that has surrounded the German over the past few weeks since the season-ending Abu Dhabi GP in early November.         
	Schumacher was seen in talks with Daimler chief Dieter Zetsche and Brawn GP team p-rincipal Brawn in the paddock of the Yas Marina circuit.         
	Just a fortnight later, Mercedes had taken over Brawn and Jenson Button was on his way to McLaren.

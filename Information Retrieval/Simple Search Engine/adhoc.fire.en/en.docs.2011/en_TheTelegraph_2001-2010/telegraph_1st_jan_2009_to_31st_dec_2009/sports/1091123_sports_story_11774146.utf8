	 Brazilian striker Joshimar is set to return for Chirag United when they take on Tollygunge Agragami in a CFL encounter at the Mohun Bagan ground Monday.      
	However, Chirag might miss the services of the injured PC Lalwampuia, and Parveen Kumar may partner Joshimar upfront. Lalkamal Bhowmick is also carrying a niggle and may not play. Jayanta Sen, in that case, will start. Veteran Basudeb Mondal may also get a look-in in the midfield. Tollygunge will field their two foreigners  Nigerians Louis Ebami and Nuruddin.                
	SOCCER: CFL  Chirag United vs Tollygunge Agragami (Mohun Bagan ground, 2.15pm).

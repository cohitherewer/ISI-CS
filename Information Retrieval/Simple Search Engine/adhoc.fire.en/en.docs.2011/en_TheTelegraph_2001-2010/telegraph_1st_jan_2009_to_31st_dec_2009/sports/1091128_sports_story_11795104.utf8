The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United look to close gap
                                                                                                                       7                                        United look to close gap

	London: Former Chelsea manager Avram Grant, who is switching from his role as Portsmouths director of football to replace Paul Hart, has a daunting first test Saturday at home to defending champions Manchester United, who are looking to close the five-point gap on Chelsea who visit Arsenal on Sunday.         
	A day on which defeat for either manager in the Merseyside battle at Goodison Park would further destabilise their positions as Liverpool make the short trip to Everton. Wolverhampton versus Birmingham is the third derby of the day.         
	United should cut Chelseas lead to two points on Saturday against a Portsmouth side that parted with manager Paul Hart on Tuesday.         
	United manager Alex Ferguson said defender Rio Ferdinand was not set for an imminent return from a back injury despite making progress with fellow defenders John Shea and Jonny Evans also doubtful for the visit to Portsmouth.         
	United will, however, welcome back Dimitar Berbatov from a knee injury for Saturdays trip and the Bulgarian striker would be looking to ease Wayne Rooneys goal-scoring burden.Which the Red Devils have to make without their manager on the sidelines since he is serving a touchline ban for his rant against referee Alan Wiley.         
	Ferdinand has not played since a 0-2 loss at Liverpool on Nov. 25 when he was easily beaten to the ball by Fernando Torres, allowing the Spain striker to score.         
	Ferguson said Friday that its difficult with back injuries. Nature sometimes helps you, but we are looking forward to him coming back.         
	But, at the moment, it seems it is the positives that United coach is looking at. Ferguson said Friday that England international Wes Brown was the best defender in the country and was still improving. The 30-year-olds flourishing partnership with Nemanja Vidic at the heart of Uniteds defence has been a silver lining among a list of injuries to key players.         
	Vidic and Brown have been fantastic in recent games. It just reminds me that when Brown is fit hes the best natural defender in the country, Ferguson told reporters ahead of Saturdays trip.         
	Like Arsenal, Chelsea have come unstuck away from home this season. They lost at Wigan Athletic, themselves thrashed 9-1 by Tottenham Hotspur in North London last Sunday, and Aston Villa.         
	Fourth-placed Spurs can leapfrog Arsenal, at least for a day, when they visit fifth-placed Villa on Saturday while Manchester City will hope to escape a record seventh successive Premier League draw when they host Hull City.         
	City could also have striker Robinho, who has been training with the Brazilian national squad, back in action for the first time since August.         
	He has come back looking sharper. Things look very promising for him in terms of the weekend, he should be up for selection, first team coach Eddie Niedzwiecki told the club website.         
	While Arsenal need to win to put the brakes on Chelsea, who won 4-1 at the Emirates last season, Liverpool are desperate for success. (AGENCIES)

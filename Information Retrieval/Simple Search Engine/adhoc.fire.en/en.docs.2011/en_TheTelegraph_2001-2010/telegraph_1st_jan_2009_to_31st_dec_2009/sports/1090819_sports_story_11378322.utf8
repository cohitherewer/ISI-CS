The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Home teams to get compensation
                                                   Home teams to get compensation
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The governing council of the Champions League Twenty20 has clarified on Tuesday that if a player, who qualifies for multiple teams, decides to play for an away team rather than his home team, the away team will have to pay $200,000 as compensation to the home team.         
	So, the Delhi DareDevils will have to cough up the amount if they wish to retain the service of a Dirk Nannes or a David Warner in the Champions League Twenty20.         
	Apart from Nannes and Warner, the DareDevils, in fact, have two more players  Andrew McDonald and Farveez Maharoof  in their ranks who also qualify to represent their home team, which means the Indian Premier League side led by Virender Sehwag would have to shell out $800,000 to get their services.         
	A number of players who are scheduled to compete in the tournament have qualified to compete for multiple teams and will face a tough decision as the final squad deadline looms.         
	Under the tournament rules, provided a player qualifies for more than one team, all those qualifying teams can nominate that player. However, away teams are not eligible for compensation if a player chooses to play for his home team.         
	The governing council also said that the members of each teams initial squad must have either played for, or must have been contracted to play for, his nominating team in the most recent qualifying Twenty20 competition played by that team.         
	For this years event, no person who has played in any unofficial cricket event can be named in a squad either as a player or coach. However teams are not disqualified from the T20 meet if they played rebel players in their qualifying tournament, provided they terminated their rebel contracts before May 31, 2009.         
	Dean Kino, Champions League Twenty20 governing council member and director of legal and business affairs, said: These qualification rules ensure that players will have a choice, subject to existing contracts, of who they represent in the Champions League T20. The $200,000 compensation paid to home teams will create significant interest in the lead up to the squad announcements.         
	Once a team names its initial squad, we will assess which players have been listed for two or more teams. Players who have been nominated by multiple teams will be contacted by Champions League T20 to nominate their chosen team.Players will then be given 24 hours to determine which team they wish to represent.         
	In addition to the $6 million in prize money, each team are guaranteed of $500,000 as participation fee. So, even teams which finish from the 9th to 12th place at the tournament will earn $600,000, while the winners will receive more than $3 million.

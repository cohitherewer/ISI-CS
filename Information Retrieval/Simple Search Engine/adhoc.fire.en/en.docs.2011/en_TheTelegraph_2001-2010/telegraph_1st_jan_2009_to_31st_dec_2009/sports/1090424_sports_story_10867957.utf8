                                                   Mahesh, Mark in 2nd round
                      
	Barcelona: Fourth seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles beat Swedish duo Robert Lindstedt and Robin Soderling 4-6, 6-1, 10-8 to reach the Barcelona Open second round.         
	They will now face the Argentine-Chilean combine of Lukas Arnold Ker and Fernando Gonzalez.         
	In the singles, world No. 1 Rafael Nadal thrashed unseeded Belgian Christophe Rochus 6-2, 6-0 on Thursday to advance to the quarter finals.         
	The Spanish top seed broke the Rochus serve twice in the first set and three times in the second on the clay in the Catalan capital and will play David Nalbandian, seeded seven, for a place in the semi-finals.         
	Nalbandian, however, has pulled out of his quarter final against Nadal due to a hip injury, the tournament doctor said on Thursday.         
	The Argentine became the first player to reach the last eight with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Spanish 10th seed Nicolas Almagro.         
	He was joined by Radek Stepanek when the Czech beat Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland 6-4, 1-6, 7-5 to set up a clash with Russian third seed Nikolay Davydenko or Spains Feliciano Lopez.         
	Second-seeded Spaniard Fernando Verdasco takes on Czech Tomas Berdych and Chiles Fernando Gonzalez plays Argentine Juan Monaco later on Thursday.           (AGENCIES)

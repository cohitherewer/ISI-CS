                                                   Viru hat goes to Gautam
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: India opener Virender Sehwag has stepped down as captain of the Delhi DareDevils just before the T20 Champions League, starting next month.         
	Sehwags opening partner, Gautam Gambhir, has been appointed the new captain, DareDevils owner, GMR chairman, Srinivas Bommidala said in a statement on Monday. Dinesh Karthik has been elevated to the rank of vice-captain.         
	Viru has been a source of great strength and inspiration to the team. When he expressed a desire to step down in order to focus on batting, we respected his decision, and accepted his request, said Bommidala.         
	Early this month, Sehwag was quoted as saying that he was not interested in leading the national team.         
	On relinquishing the Delhi DareDevils captaincy, Sehwag said: I would like to thank GMR for their understanding in accepting my request to step down. Personally, I would like to concentrate on my own batting and contribute to the team. Gautam did a great job of captaining Delhi, and also during IPL-2 in South Africa this year. He has shown very good leadership skills, and will bring fresh energy into the Delhi DareDevils.

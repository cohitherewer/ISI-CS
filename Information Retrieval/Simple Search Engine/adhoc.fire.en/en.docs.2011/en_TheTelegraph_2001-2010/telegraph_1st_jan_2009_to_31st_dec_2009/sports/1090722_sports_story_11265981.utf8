                                                   Jeev pulls out
                      
	Chandigarh: Laid low by a lingering rib injury which forced him to skip the British Open, Jeev Milkha Singh will not defend his title in the Japan Tours Nagashima Shigeo Invitational Sega Sammy Cup starting Thursday.         
	The Indian, battling a troublesome inter-costal muscle, will continue his rehabilitation and return for the WGC Championships in Akron Ohio in the first week of August.         
	One always feels bad about not being able to defend a title and I love going and playing in Japan, Jeev said.         
	The Japan Tour has been very nice to me and have always welcomed me. It is indeed a pity that I cannot go and play. But then it is also important for me to recover fully from the rib-cage muscle injury I have, he said.         
	Jeev had pulled out of the British Open last week because of the injury and the golfer said it was not an easy decision. (PTI)

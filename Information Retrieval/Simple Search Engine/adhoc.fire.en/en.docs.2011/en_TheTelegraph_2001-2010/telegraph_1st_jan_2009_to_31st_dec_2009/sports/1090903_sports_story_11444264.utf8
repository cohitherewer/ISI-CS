                                                   Viru bats for Test meet
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Virender Sehwag on Wednesday lent support to the idea of World Test Championship and advocated that India should play at least 10 matches of the longer version in a year.         
	I think we should play a minimum of eight to 10 Test matches. Thats minimum, Sehwag said at a function to launch the ICC Annual Awards here.         
	I am big fan of the 50-over format and Test cricket. I would particularly like to play more Tests, but unfortunately we are getting a lot of T20 matches. We need to give importance to every format. If you ask a cricketer, he would like to play more Tests than T20. If you are going to have a Test world championship, every player would be happy.         
	Sehwag, who has been nominated for the ODI Player of the Year award, envisioned T20 dominating the cricketing scenario in the coming years.         
	In the next five years, cricket is going to become faster. In the coming years, I think, T20 will take over everything, the Nawab of Najafgarh said.         
	The International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Haroon Lorgat, who was also present at the function, said the responsibility of preserving Test cricket and keeping the balance between the three forms of the game rested with the home Boards.         
	The responsibility rests with the home Boards. The ICC stipulates the minimum number of Test matches and ODI games (to be played by a country each year). It is the bilateral arrangement between the Boards that determines whether its five, six or seven ODIs or a five-Test series, Lorgat said.         
	Lorgat also effectively ruled out a window for the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	First of all, the BCCI or the IPL doesnt want a window. They are okay with the overseas players coming in and going out to meet international commitments, he said.         
	Secondly, the Future Tours Programme (FTP) is a basket of international fixtures not domestic fixtures. We might probably end up with an FTP that is far more complex, he said.

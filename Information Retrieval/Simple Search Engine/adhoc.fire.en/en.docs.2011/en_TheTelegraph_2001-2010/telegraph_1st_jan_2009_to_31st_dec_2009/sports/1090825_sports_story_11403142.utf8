                                                   Jeev ends tied 17th 
                      
	Greensboro: Ryan Moore ended five years of frustration when he survived a three-way play-off to win the $5.1 million Wyndham Championship on Sunday.         
	As for Jeev Milkha Singh, it was more a creditable finish than strong as he signed off with a share of the 17th place with a steady one-under 69 in the final round.         
	Jeev finished with a total of 10-under 270 and sub-par cards in all four rounds after returning a bogey-free card, comprising just one birdie, on Sunday.         
	Moore, the 2004 United States amateur champion, was widely regarded as potentially another Tiger Woods when he turned professional the following year, but he has struggled since, mainly due to a left hand injury.

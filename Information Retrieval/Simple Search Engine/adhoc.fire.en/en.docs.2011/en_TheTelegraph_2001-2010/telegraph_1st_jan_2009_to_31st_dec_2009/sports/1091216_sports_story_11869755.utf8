            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Trainer Pesi Shroffs ward Recardo is strongly fancied to lift the 1,400m Bol Publication Cup, on Wednesday. In his last outing, which was after nearly eight weeks, the Placerville-Castle Park son was hard-pressed to beat a racing fit Mysterious Star (P. Kamelsh-up) who is presently enjoying a marginal handicap advantage. With C. Alford in the saddle, a fitter Recardo may be hard to beat. Alfords another ride, Strike A Deal, may also win the Sentouki Plate, the baby race.

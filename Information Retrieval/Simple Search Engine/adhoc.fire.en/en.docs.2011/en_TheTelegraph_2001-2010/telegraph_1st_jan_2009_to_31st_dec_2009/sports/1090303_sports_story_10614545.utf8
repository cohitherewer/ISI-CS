The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saina to open vs Hongyan 
                                                   Saina to open vs Hongyan 
                      
	New Delhi: Indian shuttler Saina Nehwal will open her campaign against old rival French Hongyan Pi in the Yonex All England Open Super Series on Wednesday.         
	A shoulder injury had forced the world No. 10 to skip the National Championships last month and coach Pullela Gopichand feels although she is fit, she could be a little wary since this would be her first tournament since coming back from injury. I dont think the injury will have any bearing on her performance but yes, since it is her first tournament after the injury, she may feel a bit wary in the initial moments, Gopichand said.         
	The former All-England champion said the first match would be a tough one and decide the course of the tournament.         
	World No. 13 Chetan Anand, who also stayed away from the National championship owing to a thigh injury, will take on Andrew Smith of England in the first round. (PTI)

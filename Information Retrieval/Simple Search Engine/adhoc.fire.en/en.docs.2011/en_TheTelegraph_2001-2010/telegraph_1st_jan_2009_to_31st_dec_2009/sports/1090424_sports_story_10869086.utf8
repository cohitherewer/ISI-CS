The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lees Ashes berth under threat
                                                   Lees Ashes berth under threat
                      
	Melbourne: Australian pacer Brett Lee could be left out of the squad for the Ashes Series against England in July as the pace of his recovery is slow.         
	According to a report in a local newspaper, Lee is currently only 70 per cent fit after undergoing foot and ankle surgery in January.         
	Highly-placed Australian sources insist Lee is behind schedule in his recovery from foot and ankle surgery, and it would not be the shock of the century if he was overlooked for the Ashes, the newspaper said.         
	Lee was picked for the ongoing ODI series against Pakistan but the slow pace of his recovery meant that he had to be replaced.         
	Lee is currently in South Africa, undergoing rehabilitation and training. (PTI)

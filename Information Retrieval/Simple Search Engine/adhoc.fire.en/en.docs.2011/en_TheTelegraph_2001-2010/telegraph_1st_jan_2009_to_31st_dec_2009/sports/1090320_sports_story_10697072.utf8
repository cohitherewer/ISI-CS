	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly was hit on the visor of his helmet during a practice match between the Kolkata Knight Riders probables at the Eden on Thursday.         
	It happened when the former Team India captain missed a short-pitched delivery from Kerala left-arm pacer Prasanth Parameshwar in the seventh ball of his innings.         
	Sourav was not injured, but had to change his helmet and batted for 30 balls during his stay in the middle.         
	Dada praised me. I was overwhelmed and it feels nice when a player of his stature praises you, Prasanth said after the match.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | It was simply fantastic, says Bindra
                                                   It was simply fantastic, says Bindra
                      
	Bangalore: Abhinav Bindra on Thursday joined the elite list of VVIPs to experience the thrill of flying a fighter jet and the ace shooter compared the mid-air experience to winning the yellow metal in Beijing.         
	Bindra was here as a special invitee to the 7th Aero India 2009 and flew aboard Lockheed Martins fighter jet F-16IN Super Viper, specifically designed for the Indian Air Force.         
	Words cannot explain the excitement I felt in those 45 minutes on board the F16IN. It was simply fantastic. I am still coming to terms with my experience.         
	It was probably similar to what I felt when I won the Olympic gold last August, said Bindra who flew alongwith former US Navy pilot Paul Bear Randall.         
	I salute all those brave men who risk their lives to fly in the air to shoot targets unknown and invisible to them, and all this because they love their country. The F16IN  I believe is a step towards making the lives of these brave men a little easy and make them better equipped miles above in the air, said Bindra.         
	During the 45-minute flight, Bindra took over the controls of the aircraft, though momentarily, from the 42-year-old US fighter pilot Paul Randall.         
	Bindra said he never feared for a moment during the entire journey.         
	I knew I was in safe hands, he said with a smile, alluding to pilot Paul.         
	Paul, in a quick repartee, said the fear factor never gripped him either  even when Bindra took controls of the aircraft.         
	I too knew I was in safe hands, he quipped.         
	Bindra also witnessed some of the bulls eye-precision manouevres the fighter is capable of.           (PTI)

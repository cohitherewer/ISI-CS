The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vintage Brazil drub Italy 3-0
                                                   Vintage Brazil drub Italy 3-0
                      
	Pretoria: Brazil knocked world champions Italy out of the Confederations Cup with three quick goals just before halftime to earn a 3-0 victory on Sunday and in Rustenburg, the United States profited from the world champions defeat when they came from a near impossible position to claim a semi-final berth, hammering Egypt 3-0.         
	For Brazil, strikes from Luis Fabiano after 37 and 43 minutes and an own goal from Andrea Dossena just before the interval left the holders top of Group B and set up a semi-final against hosts South Africa in Johannesburg on Thursday. The Americans play Spain in the first semi-final on Wednesday.         
	The US, who started the night bottom of the group with no points after two straight defeats, qualified ahead of Italy and Egypt on goal difference following a shock 3-0 win.         
	The US finished with a goal difference of minus two along with the Italians but scored four goals in the group to Italys three.         
	 Charlie Davies Michael Bradley and Clint Dempsey were the scorers for the US.         
	The defeat completed a miserable tournament for Marcello Lippis men who were also beaten by Egypt and finished in third place.         
	It was also a bittersweet night for captain Fabio Cannavaro who equalled Paolo Maldinis record of 126 appearances for his country but was helpless in preventing Italy from conceding three goals in the first half of an international for the first time since 1957 when they lost 6-1 to Yugoslavia.         
	Only goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and the woodwork stopped them conceding as many to the Brazilians who head into the last four having scored 10 goals in three group matches.         
	It was no real surprise when Brazil went ahead after 37 minutes. Luis Fabiano scored with a shot on the turn which left Buffon floundering and he doubled the advantage after a brilliant move between Robinho and Kaka.         
	Robinho let the return pass roll past him, Daniele De Rossi committed himself and left Luis Fabiano with time to chip the ball over Buffon.         
	Worse was to come for the world champions as another driving run from Robinho forced the unfortunate Dossena to turn the ball past Buffon and send the Brazilians into raptures.         
	Brazil could have been 5-0 up at halftime after hitting the woodwork twice through Ramires and a deflection off De Rossi.         
	It was an amazing comeback by the US, made almost surreal by a crowd seemingly oblivious of the unfolding permutations.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jan. 17 tryst with Fifa World Cup
                                                     Jan. 17 tryst with Fifa World Cup
  - Calcutta one of two Indian cities selected for global trophy tour       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            File picture of the Italian players celebrating their 2006 World Cup triumph in Berlin                                 
	Zurich: Come January 17 and the Fifa World Cup trophy will be on view in Calcutta, courtesy Coca-Cola, a long-standing and high-profile partner of soccers governing body.         
	A day earlier, the trophy, made exclusively of 18-carat gold, will be on display in New Delhi.         
	Calcutta and New Delhi are the only Indian cities selected for the global trophy tour, which is part of the build up to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.         
	The trophy tour begins from the Fifa House here, on Monday afternoon, and will end in the host nation on May 4. By then, 86 countries and over 134,000km would have been covered. The most-awaited (and, indeed, watched) tournament is to be staged between June 11-July 11.         
	Edition No.1 of the trophy tour, in 2006, had involved a mere 29 countries. This one, therefore, is going to be huge.         
	In a statement to The Telegraph, the Coca-Cola India president and CEO, Atul Singh, said: This Fifa World Cup trophy tour is going to be bigger and better and provides us the right opportunity to further promote a sporting culture in our country... It will be a huge boost for football, as a sport, in India...         
	Singhs roots, incidentally, are in Calcutta (hes an alumnus of La Martiniere) and, so, there must also have been a personal element at play in ensuring that the city actually gets to see the trophy.         
	Back in April 2002, a replica had come to Calcutta, thanks to another sponsors initiative.         
	Coca-Cola India, which recently inked a deal with the All India Football Federation, plans a string of promotionals centring around the trophy tour.         
	The specifics of security arent known as yet, but the level of vigil is bound to be of the highest order, given everything thats associated with the Fifa World Cup trophy.         
	Cameroon icon Roger Milla, meanwhile, is expected to be present at the ceremonial start from Fifa House.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Deep may review his future with Bengal
                                                                                                                                   Deep may review his future with Bengal
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A new controversy has cropped up with each and every match that Bengal have played this season.         
	If it was the issue of interference from chairman of selectors Sambaran Banerjee during the Baroda match of the Ranji Trophy, the tie against Karnataka, which began in Mysore Tuesday, saw the captaincy issue come into forefront, again, with Manoj Tiwarys gain being Deep Dasguptas loss.         
	With regular captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla choosing to opt out after failing to pass a fitness test, the team management preferred a young Tiwary ahead of veteran Dasgupta, although the latter had the backing of at least three selectors on the eve of the match. It turned out to be an embarrassment for the former Bengal captain whose batting order was also shuffled at the last moment.         
	If sources are to be believed, there is a high possibility that Dasgupta may not be seen representing Bengal after the ongoing Karnataka match. It is learnt that the senior pro has admitted in his close circle that he is not enjoying playing for Bengal though he firmly believes that he has at least two years of cricket left in him.         
	Tiwary being one of the premier performers in the side was definitely an ideal replacement for Shukla. But the manner in which the whole episode was handled by the selectors and the team management, has left a lot to be desired.         
	Tiwary has always been a serious contender for the captains job. However, with the positive feelers sent out by the selectors, coupled with the late intimation about the change in plans about his batting order (No. 3 instead of No. 7), has no doubt left Dasgupta humiliated.         
	Dasgupta was however unavailable for comment.         
	Tiwary on the other hand is relishing each and every moment of his debut as first-class skipper.         
	I came to know half-an-hour before the match that I was supposed to lead. Its always a great honour to lead Bengal. Captaincy is something I have always enjoyed  be it for India U-19 or Bengal U-22 or the East Zone. It gives me great satisfaction to perform under pressure, said Tiwary.         
	Is it bothering him that he has now missed the three-figure mark in three successive matches, he replied: Its always good to get a century. But more importantly, all my knocks have benefited my team. I always believe that a captain should lead by example and I am just trying to do that, Tiwary said.         
	He was effusive in his praise for young Rohan Banerjee who hit 107 opening the innings. Full credit to Rohan for the kind of maturity he has shown. It was only his sixth first-class match and his performance was a revelation. I will also give credit to Arindam Das for the manner in which he partnered Rohan. The first hour was really very important. The ball was doing all sorts of things and they took the attack back to the opposition.

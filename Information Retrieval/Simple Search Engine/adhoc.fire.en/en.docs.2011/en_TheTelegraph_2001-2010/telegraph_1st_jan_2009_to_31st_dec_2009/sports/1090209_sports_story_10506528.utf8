The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Holland start favourites
                                                   Holland start favourites
                      
	Chandigarh: India will have to play out of their skins and avoid giving away soft penalty corners if they are to take the challenge to European champions Holland in the finals of the four-nation Punjab Gold Cup hockey tournament at the sector-42 stadium here Monday.         
	Going by statistics, Holland have the upper hand over the hosts as the Indians have not beaten the Dutch in the last 13 years. Their last win came in January 1996 in the Olympic qualifiers.         
	Conceding soft penalty corners has been Indias major concern in the tournament. Although, the hosts have lost only one game in the competition, against Olympic champions Germany, they have conceded the maximum number of short corners in the event so far.         
	On the other hand, having remained undefeated in the competition, finishing with 14 points from six matches, the Dutch are on a high, especially after they outplayed world champions Germany 7-1 in the last league match here Saturday.         
	India coach-in-charge Harendra Singh too admitted that giving away easy short corners has been a matter of concern but said if the players stick to the plan Monday beating Holland wont be a problem.

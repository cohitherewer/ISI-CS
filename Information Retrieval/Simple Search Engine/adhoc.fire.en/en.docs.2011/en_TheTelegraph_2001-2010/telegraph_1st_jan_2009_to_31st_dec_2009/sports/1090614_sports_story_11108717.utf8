                                                   Gibbs, Parnell propel Proteas to victory
                      
	London: South Africa beat the West Indies by 20 runs in a Super Eight stage match of the World Twenty20 Saturday.         
	After South Africa had put a challenging total of 183 for seven at the Oval, Wayne Parnell took four for 13 and Roelof van der Merwe and Dale Steyn took two wickets each to restrict the West Indies to 163 for nine in the stipulated 20 overs. Lendl Simmons was the top scorer for the Windies with 77.         
	South Africas Herschelle Gibbs smashed 55 off 35 balls, which included eight fours and a six, while teammates Jacques Kallis and Smith hit 45 and 31 respectively. Jerome Taylor took three for 30 as the West Indies managed to slow down the scoring rate by taking five for 35 in the final five overs.         
	West Indies must now beat England on Monday to qualify for the semi-finals.         
	West Indies captain Chris Gayle won the toss and asked South Africa to bat first on an excellent pitch with a fast outfield.         
	Taylor conceded just two runs in his opening over but in his next went for 16, including a towering six by Kallis over extra cover.         
	Dwayne Bravo replaced him at the Vauxhall End and immediately went for 13, but the breakthrough came in the sixth over, when Smith was caught at backward point by Andre Fletcher off Sulieman Benn.         
	Gibbs joined Kallis and the pair consolidated the innings. But after completing their 50 partnership from 35 balls, Kallis was caught by Kieron Pollard off Simmons at long on.         
	Gibbss dismissal was also soft, caught at midwicket by Taylor off Pollard in the 15th over.         
	The Proteas still looked set to pass 200, but Taylor pegged them back with two wickets in the 17th over. AB. de Villiers went for 17 when he offered a high catch to Gayle at extra cover, and Taylor then bowled Albie Morkel for 10.         
	JP Duminy was out first ball, caught by Ramnaresh Sarwan off Edwards, and Van der Merwe followed, caught by wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin off Taylor.In the final over, Mark Boucher smacked Edwards for six and Johan Botha was dropped as South Africa added 13 runs.         
	The West Indians made a timid start to their innings, with Fletcher going for a duck off the third ball, caught by Botha off Parnell, who then bowled Gayle for 5. Bravo, the star of Fridays win over India, survived when he was caught by Smith at mid on with the umpire ruling Morkels delivery, a high, full toss, as a no ball.

	Moscow: Ten-man Germany beat Russia 1-0 on Saturday to qualify for the World Cup finals. Miroslav Kloses 35th-minute strike clinched the win and saw Germany stretch their lead at the top of qualifying Group 4 to four points, with one round of matches remaining.         
	The result means second-place Russia cannot catch Germany and will have to win a playoff match if they are to join the visitors in South Africa next year.         
	The three-time world champions had to play the final 22 minutes without defender Jerome Boateng, who received two yellow cards.         
	Russia travels to Azerbaijan and Germany hosts Finland on Wednesday.         
	Klose silenced the 80,000-strong home crowd when he stabbed the ball home from six metres after a one-two with Lukas Podolski  the forwards 50th goal for the national team.         
	Russia subjected the Germans to intense pressure but couldnt convert their many chances.         
	We prepared the team in such a way that we said, we have our hand on the ticket to South Africa, we can decide it ourselves if we win here  and the team put that into effect very well, Germany coach Joachim Loew said.         
	Hiddink was confident that Russia would negotiate a playoff. If we play as we have in this and recent qualifying games, we are of course favourites.         
	Serhiy Nazarenko scored the only goal as Ukraine beat Group 6 winner England 1-0 in World Cup qualifying on Saturday to strengthen their chances of reaching the finals.         
	Nazarenko scored in the 29th minute to end Englands winning run of eight qualifiers after Andriy Shevchenko had missed a penalty and England had goalkeeper Robert Green sent off for taking down Artem Milevskiy inside the area.         
	The result leaves England with 24 points from nine games and Ukraine has overtaken Croatia in second place. Ukraine has 18 points and Croatia 17 going into next Wednesdays final round of group games.         
	The eight best runners up in the nine groups qualify for the playoffs in November.         
	Juanma Mata scored a 64th-minute penalty Saturday to give European champion Spain a 2-1 win over Armenia to stay unbeaten in World Cup qualifying.         
	The Valencia forward slotted a left-footed shot past Roman Berezovsky after the goalkeeper had been booked for taking Mata down.         
	Cesc Fabregas gave Spain the lead in the 33rd minute after receiving a pass from Xavi Hernandez and chipping the ball over Berezovsky. But Robert Arzumanyan equalised from a header in the 58th at Hrazdan Stadium.         
	Spain has 27 points in Group 5 after their ninth straight win and has already qualified for next years tournament in South Africa. Armenia is last with four.         
	Ivory Coast too advanced after substitute striker Didier Drogba scored a second-half equaliser in a 1-1 draw with Malawi.         
	Ivory Coast coach Vahid Halilhodic left the former Africa Footballer of Year on the bench, and he came on to equalise three minutes after Malawi went 1-0 up in the 64th minute and take his international tally to 39 goals in 57 internationals.         
	Malawi captain Peter Mponda fouled Salomon Kalou at the edge of the penalty area, and Drogba pounced on a poor header by Mponda from the resulting free kick to fire low past goalkeeper Swadick Sanudi.

	Calcutta: The city bookmakers have been reaping a rich harvest in the last quater of the season, and Friday, the concluding fixture of the season, may not be any different. The win-hungry trainers are showing no mercy on the battered punters and favourites have been falling like nine pins. Nevertheless, the afternoons feature-event, the 1,200m Desert Fire Cup, may bring some relief to all concerned as trainer Arti Doctors likely favourite, Impressive Wish, is expected to deliver the goods in the hands of the champion jockey C. Alford.

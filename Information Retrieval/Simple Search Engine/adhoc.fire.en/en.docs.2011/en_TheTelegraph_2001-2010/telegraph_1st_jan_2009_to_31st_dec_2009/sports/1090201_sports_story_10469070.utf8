            A STAFF REPORTER            Sporting Clube de Goas Joseph Pereira scores past Mohammedan Sporting goalkeeper Naseem Akhtar on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting compounded their relegation problems, going down by a solitary goal to I-League leaders Sporting Clube de Goa in their 13th round match at home Saturday.         
	Joseph Pereira chased down a ball and tapped in the only goal of the match in the 16th minute after Mohammedan Sporting goalkeeper Naseem Akhtar spilled a shot from Sporting Clubes Nigerian Elijah Obagbemiro Junior.         
	The local club had their best chance when Liberian striker Eugene Gray, though unchallenged, failed to connect to a brilliant cross from Mike Okoro with five minutes of regulation time remaining.         
	Ghanaian Okoro toiled throughout the match but his individual brilliance was not enough for the black-and-white brigade. On the eve of the match, coach Shabbir Ali had spoken about Okoros lack of support upfront, and he was vindicated in Saturdays match.         
	League leaders Sporting Clube had few anxious moments in the match and on most occasions Okoro was involved.         
	The Mohammedan Sporting midfield failed to function and could feed a few balls to their strikers. Gray, who replaced Theodore Sunday as the clubs third foreigner, would probably need a few more matches before he starts combining with the team.         
	Unhappy with their teams dismal show, irate Mohammedan Sporting supporters caused a disruption in the proceedings in the second half which saw the match held up for close to three minutes. The Goan club reached 28 points from 13 matches, four ahead of Mohun Bagan, who have played a match less. Mohammedan Sporting stayed at 11th with 10 points but are only a point ahead of bottom-placed Vasco.         
	Coach Shabbir admitted that the relegation fight was getting tougher by the day for Mohammedan Sporting. We cant miss chances like today. Its getting tougher for us, he said.         
	Sporting Clube de Goa coach Viswas Gaonkar said: It was a good performance by the boys. I am happy with the three points. The boys worked had and we played as a team.         
	Our aim is to get three points in every match. Were not following the title Let the title follow us.

	Calcutta: Andrew Strauss, who was confirmed as England s Test captain on Thursday, said he was looking forward to the challenges in the ensuing tour of the West Indies.         
	The selectors will meet Friday to discuss the make-up of the squad and the captaincy for the one-day and Twenty20 Internationals, according to an ECB release.         
	It is a great honour to be named as England captain and I am looking forward to the challenges ahead, Strauss said.         
	Towards the fag end of the India tour, there were signs that Kevin and Peter Moores were not getting on well as they possibly could do.         
	I recognise that this isnt the easiest time to take the role but clearly we have some exciting and world class players in our dressing room and the task ahead is to ensure that we play to the best of our ability in the months and years ahead.         
	I would like to thank Kevin Pietersen for his efforts as England captain.         
	He is one of the greatest players in the world and I am delighted that he has confirmed that he is available to play in all our forthcoming fixtures.         
	I fully believe that in everything Kevin did as England captain that he acted solely in what he felt was in the best interests of the team.         
	I know Kevin extremely well and appreciate he may be bruised at the moment but he will bounce back and will be one of the most important figures going forward, Strauss explained.         
	Strauss added: I would also like to add my appreciation for the efforts of Peter Moores.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cook ends the drought
                                                   Cook ends the drought
                      
	Bridgetown: Alastair Cook scored his first century in 16 Tests as England drew the fourth Test with West Indies, making 279 for two on the final day at the Kensington Oval.         
	The result means West Indies head into Fridays final Test in Port of Spain 1-0 up and knowing they cannot be beaten in the series  the first time they have avoided defeat in a Test series against England since 1998.         
	From the lunch break onwards, the game consisted of little more than televised batting practice for Cook, whose unbeaten 139 was his highest Test score and Kevin Pietersen (72 not out)  the pair making a 150 run partnership.         
	A flat, placid batting wicket resulted in first innings totals of 600 for England and 749 for West Indies and with little sign of deterioration on the final day, the game petered out into a draw.         
	Until last week there had never been a Test featuring scores of over 600 and 700 and there have now been two after Pakistan and Sri Lanka produced a similar result in Karachi  and those drawn tests will re-open the debate on whether wickets are now overly friendly for batsmen.         
	At the start of play on Monday, there was a lingering notion of an upset if the West Indies could pick up some early wickets and put England, who had collapsed to 51 all out in the first Test, under pressure.         
	It swiftly became apparent that the tourists were going to cruise through the day  even a spell of aggressive pace bowling from Fidel Edwards did little to create a sense of a surprise in the air.         
	Resuming, 143 runs behind West Indies, Englands opening pair of Andrew Strauss and Cook confidently put on 88 for the first wicket. Skipper Strauss fell for 38 to his counterpart Chris Gayle  chopping an attempted cut onto his own wicket.

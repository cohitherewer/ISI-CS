The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania falters   in title round
                                                   Sania falters   in title round
                            
	Vancouver: Top seed Sania Mirzas quest for a second successive ITF title ended in disappointment as she squandered a one set advantage to go down to local favourite Stephanie Dubois in the final of the $75,000 Vancuover Open here.         
	Sania lost 6-1, 4-6, 4-6 against a gritty Stephanie, who said the Indian ace looked jaded after playing tough quarter final and semi-final matches, incidentally against Canadians.         
	With a partisan crowd egging her on, Stephanie staged a remarkable comeback after being blown away by Sania in the opening set. Both the players struggled to hold serve in the match, but it was Sania who ended up paying more for the mistakes as Stephanie raised her game at crucial junctures.         
	I think that the other Canadians tired her a little bit, they had a really good match, (both) of them, said Stephanie.         
	Sania thanked the few Indian fans, who had turned up to support her. I guess it helps that were a billion of us, she joked.           (PTI)

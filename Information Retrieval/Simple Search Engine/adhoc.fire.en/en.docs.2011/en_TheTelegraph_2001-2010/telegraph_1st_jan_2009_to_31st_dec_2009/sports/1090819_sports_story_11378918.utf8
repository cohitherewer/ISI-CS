	Toronto: Russian Maria Sharapova signalled she might be close to a return to top form by dismissing 10th seeded Nadia Petrova 6-3, 6-4 in the first round of the $2 million Toronto Cup on Monday.         
	While her current ranking of 49th in the world suggests Sharapova provided a big upset, in reality it was a routine victory for the three-time Grand Slam winner as she improved her record against Petrova to 8-1.         
	It was rough opening day for the French with 13th seed Marion Bartoli and 15th seed Amelie Mauresmo both bowing out.         
	Bartoli again made an early exit losing 6-4, 6-3 to Ukraines Alona Bondarenko. Mauresmo displayed plenty of rust in falling 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 to 27th ranked Italian Francesca Schiavone.         
	Fourteenth seed Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland was the only seeded player to survive the opening day after she stopped Spains Carla Suarez Navarro 6-3, 6-3.           (REUTERS)

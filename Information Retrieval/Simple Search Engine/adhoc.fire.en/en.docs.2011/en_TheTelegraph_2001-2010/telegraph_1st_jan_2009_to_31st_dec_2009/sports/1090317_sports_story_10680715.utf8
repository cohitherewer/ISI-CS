                                                   Fatigue a part of game: Ishfaq 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagans Ishfaq Ahmed feels playing matches day in and day out is just a part of the profession and a player should not complain much about it. Everywhere in the world footballers play matches day in and day out. I guess it is part of our job. As a professional footballer you cant crib about too many matches being played, Ishfaq said at a news conference on Monday, the eve of Mohun Bagans AFC Cup match against Al Wehdat.         
	Ishfaq, who has been one of the players to have regularly featured in Bagans matches this season, said fatigue is always a factor but you should know how to recover from that. We have a good coach in Karim (Bencharifa) and he knows how to keep us fresh, Ishfaq said, as his coach smilingly looked on.         
	Al Wehdats Iraqi coach Akram Ahmed Salman said they would not take Mohun Bagan lightly. They are a good side, and will have crowd support. I am expecting a tough match, he said.         
	The man, who was the coach of the Iraq national team during the violent World Cup qualifier against Qatar, hosted at the Salt Lake Stadium in 1985, said hopefully his second visit would not be that bad. The teams had been involved in a fierce off-field battle after the tie that had ended 2-1 in favour of Iraq. This time, I am eager to take back fond memories, he said through his interpreter.

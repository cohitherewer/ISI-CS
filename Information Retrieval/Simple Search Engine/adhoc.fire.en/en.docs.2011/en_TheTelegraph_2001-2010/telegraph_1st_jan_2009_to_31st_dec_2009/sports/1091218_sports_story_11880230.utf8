            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mahendra Singh Dhoni might be staying with Chennai Super Kings, after all, when the Indian Premier League enters its fourth year in 2011.         
	The IPL had announced earlier that two new teams would be added to the existing eight from its fourth season onwards and consequently players, both new and those who had already been sold, would be up for sale once again.         
	However, the IPL governing council, which met here on Thursday, seems to have made a partial roll-back on the contentious issue.         
	Certain teams will keep certain players, IPL chairman Lalit Modi said after the governing council meeting.         
	Sources in the IPL clarified that while the modalities were yet to be worked out, the decision would allow the franchises to retain the core of their teams.         
	The exact position is not yet clear but one would imagine so (that key players like Dhoni would stay with their respective teams), a source said.         
	Basically, the core of the team will be retained. Whether its four or five players and other details have to be worked out, the source added.         
	Meanwhile, BCCI president Shashank Manohar reiterated that Modi would stay as IPL chairman till 2012 and termed reports of a rift between Srinivasan and Modi as false.         
	The other decisions of the IPL governing council were:         
	The base bid price for the two new teams would be $225,000.         
	 $750,000 has been fixed as cap for franchises when they bid for players for 2010 season during the January 19 auction.

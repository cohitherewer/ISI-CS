The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sunny saw it coming 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sunny saw it coming 
            OUR BUREAU                      
	Sunil Gavaskar had seen it coming. At any rate, the iconic batsman had been confused as to how the newly-laid Kotla track, which he described as a hair transplant pitch, would behave during the fifth one-dayer.         
	In his pitch report in the morning, Gavaskar had pointed out that it would be a tricky strip to bat on and had added that the batsmen would need to be watchful in the first half-an-hour.         
	Its a hair transplant pitch with bald patches and some patches of grass. Batsmen have to watch out. I am not sure about it. Looks like a batting first pitch. Difficult to predict what it will do, he had said.         
	After the match was abandoned, Gavaskar said it was not safe for batsmen to continue batting on the unfriendly track.         
	There were tufts of grass on the pitch. Playing (there) was dangerous and the physical safety of the players is important.         
	The ball was rising from the good length, which is quite dangerous. Players like Jeff Thomson had the natural ability to bounce the ball but here it was a different case, he said.         
	The following are the other reactions (alphabetically), including that of former BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya :         
	Abbas Ali Baig: What happened is sad and disappointing. The DDCA should have ensured that the pitch was well prepared. There is no excuse for such a mistake.         
	Jagmohan Dalmiya: Some other time I might have given my reaction on this issue but not today... Since we have had an issue (the lights going off for 26 minutes at Eden Gardens during the fourth ODI), people may think that I am trying to divert public attention.         
	Deep Dasgupta: Thanks to the match officials, a major embarrassment in the form of a serious injury to any player was avoided. It was an absolutely correct decision to call off the match.         
	Ajay Jadeja: I am a little surprised that the match was abandoned. I dont think the pitch was that bad so as to warrant an abandonment.         
	Kiran More: Strong action should be taken against the DDCA and explanation sought. It has brought a bad name to India.                     
	Madan Lal: The DDCA should hold an inquiry as to why such a thing has happened. I cant imagine a match getting abandoned at the Kotla. It is a very serious issue and all the joy for the 3-1 series win has been rendered meaningless.               
	Prabir Mukherjee: Its a national shame. An ODI pitch should always be firm and have even bounce. But at the Kotla, we saw a low bounce pitch during the Champions League T20 in October. Suddenly, the ball started flying around on Sunday. Its an indicator for an underprepared wicket where they have just left patches of grass to bind the surface. I guess they didnt roll it properly. More than sacking Daljit Singh and his committee, one should ask who are the ones who appointed these curators.

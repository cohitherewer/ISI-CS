                                                   Feels good to be back in ODIs: Dravid
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Rahul Dravid on Friday sought to play down his inclusion in the preliminary squad for the ICC Champions Trophy, saying that his inclusion in the final squad was not automatic and hoped the Indian team would benefit from his selection.         
	It feels good to be back in the (ODI) squad but I cant take it too lightly. I will look to perform well and not let the team down, Dravid, who was in the city on a promotional visit, told reporters.         
	Dravid, who has been out of the scheme of things in the shorter version, was named among the 30 probables for the ICC Champions Trophy, to be played in South Africa in September. The squad will be pruned to 15 next month.         
	Dravid said he was happy with the increasing media attention for other sports and sportspersons in India.         
	It is something you cant complain about and other sports have started to catch up. We all saw in the Olympics how Abhinav (Bindra) did us proud and people like Sania (Mirza) and Saina (Nehwal) have been doing well in their respective sports, the former India captain said.         
	The 36-year-old also wished legendary Sunil Gavaskar on turning 60.         
	He was a fantastic role model for most of us and the legend that he is, I wish him all happiness and much more for all that he has done for Indian cricket, the Bangalorean said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Southee gets a place in squad
                                                   Southee gets a place in squad
                      
	Wellington: New Zealand on Tuesday included young pacer Tim Southee in their squad for the series-deciding third and final cricket Test against India starting Friday here.         
	The failure of the New Zealand bowlers to dismiss the Indian batsmen despite having two days at their disposal allowed the visitors to force a draw in the second Test.         
	The Black Caps were in the drivers seat for the first three days of the Test. India have a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.         
	New Zealand selection panel head Glenn Turner said the 20-year-old Southees inclusion would strengthen the New Zealand attack.         
	Tims inclusion gives us additional options with the new ball, and strengthens the attack against this strong Indian batting line-up, Turner said in a statement.         
	Ironically, Southee had been dropped after going for 105 runs in his 10 overs during the third one-dayer against India.         
	Meanwhile, injured batsman Daniel Flynn has been retained and a final call on whether he would play would be taken before the Test.         
	Jamie How would continue to be with the squad as Flynns cover.         
	Turner said all-rounder Jacob Oram was not considered for selection as his Achilles tendon strain has got aggravated.

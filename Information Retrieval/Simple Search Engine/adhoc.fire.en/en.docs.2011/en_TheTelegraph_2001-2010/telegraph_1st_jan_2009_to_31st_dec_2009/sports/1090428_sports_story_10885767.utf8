The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Royals face might of the DareDevils
                                                   Royals face might of the DareDevils
                      
	Pretoria: A struggling Rajasthan Royals will look to revive their title defence while a rampaging Delhi DareDevils will strive to continue their unbeaten run when the two sides lock horns in the Indian Premier League (IPL) encounter here Tuesday.         
	The Virender Sehwag-led Delhi team are gradually emerging as one of the strongest title contenders and are comfortably second in the points tally after winning all their three matches played so far.         
	On the other hand, Shane Warnes Rajasthan Royals have managed just three points by virtue of the tied match against the Kolkata Knight Riders, which they won in the Super Over. The DareDevils formidable batting line-up, which scored 189 for five  the highest score of the tournament so far  against last years runners-up Chennai Super Kings in their second outing, has made them a force to reckon with.         
	Their explosive opening pair of Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir, followed by the likes of Tillekaratne Dilshan, who scored a gutsy 67 to guide the team to a six-wicket win over the Royal Challengers Bangalore Sunday, will be a worry for the Rajasthan bowlers.         
	In-form AB de Villiers and Mithun Manhas have also proved themselves in trying moments and the DareDevils are not finding it difficult to chase down stiff targets.         
	In the bowling department, Dutch-born Australian left-arm pacer Dirk Nannes, along with India discard Ashish Nehra, is consistently getting early breakthroughs. The new-ball pair are finding support from the spin duo of Amit Mishra and New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori.         
	In contrast, the Royals have looked like a shadow of the winning unit they were last season.         
	Young pacer Kamran Khan, who scalped two wickets for 15 runs for a losing cause in Sundays match against the Kings XI Punjab, and speedster Munaf Patel, are surely doing their bit but the batting has failed to complement them.

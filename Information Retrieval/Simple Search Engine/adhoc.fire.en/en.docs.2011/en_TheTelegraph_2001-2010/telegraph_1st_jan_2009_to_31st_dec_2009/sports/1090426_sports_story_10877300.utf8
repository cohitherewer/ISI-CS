	Durban: Pragyan Ojha took three wickets while Herschelle Gibbs hit a brisk 44-ball 58 as the Deccan Chargers beat the Mumbai Indians by 12 runs in the Indian Premier League (IPL) here Saturday.         
	This was the Chargers third win in a row. It took them to the top of the points table.         
	Gibbs slammed six fours and a couple of sixes to help the Chargers post a competitive total of 168 for nine, before Ojha weaved his magic to restrict the Mumbai side just 12 runs short of the target.         
	Chasing 169, Mumbai made a watchful start after losing Sanath Jayasuriya cheaply in the second over. Tendulkar (36) combined well with South African JP Duminy (47) to score the teams first 50 in six overs, en route to a second-wicket stand of 82 runs in 55 balls.         
	In the fifth over, Tendulkar welcomed Harmeet Singh with consecutive fours and followed it up with a mighty six over long off before Duminy sealed it with a flashing four over cover.         
	Tendulkar and Duminy played sensibly to post 84 runs in 10 overs but after the strategy break, the complexion of the match changed as Pragyan struck thrice, removing Tendulkar, Shikar Dhawan and Duminy in his four overs. Part-time spinner Venugopal Rao tightened the screws. Although Harbhajan Singh kept the hopes alive with some lusty blows, it was too little too late.         
	Earlier, Gibbs anchored the Chargers innings after skipper Adam Gilchrist won the toss and elected to bat. The chargers made a good start with Gilchrist and Gibbs stitching together a 63-run partnership, of which the 50 came in just 33 balls.         
	After getting his eye in, Gilchrist (35) slammed Malingas fifth ball for the first six of the day over long-off and soon Gibbs joined him, smacking Zaheer in the next over. The duo played sensibly, with Gilchrist bringing up the 50 with a nice boundary off Harbhajan singh.         
	Dwayne Bravo made the first breakthrough, removing Gilchrist in his first over when he tried to reach out to a wide delivery, only to be caught behind by wicketkeeper Pinal Shah. However, that didnt stop the run flow as West Indian Dwayne Smith clubbed two fours and a six, posting 88 for one in 10 overs. After the break, Gibbs hit Dhawal Kulkarni for a six over mid-wicket to bring up the 100. Gibbs continued the blitzkrieg, welcoming Jayasuriya with a six in the next over. Smith tried to follow Gibbs, only to see his woods disturbed.         
	In the 14th over, Gibbs brought up his 50 with a single off Zaheer Khan before a terrible mix-up with Venugopal Rao in the 16th over ended his innings.         
	Once Gibbs was back in the hut, Rao also didnt last long and was bowled by Lasith Malinga after Tendulkar dropped his catch off the previous ball. The Chargers lost the plot thereafter and fell like ninepins, losing R.P. Singh (4), Fidel Edwards (1) and Ravi Teja (9) within 15 balls with Malinga claiming Edwardss wicket with the last ball of the innings.

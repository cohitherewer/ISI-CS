	There seems to be no quick fix to the Kolkata Knight Riders problems. Only the law of averages can now hold out some hope in arresting the string of defeats. On Sunday, at the Wanderers in Johannesburg, the Knight Riders were done in by a nightmarish start.         
	The 124-run target proved too little for the Delhi DareDevils as they cantered to a seven-wicket victory with 17 balls to spare.         
	Eight losses in ten matches has buried whatever hopes the Knight Riders might have harboured while the DareDevils, who moved to the top of the table, have more or less confirmed their semi-final berth.         
	AB de Villiers solid 40 off 32 balls and his 56-run unbroken fourth-wicket partnership with Dinesh Karthik took them home. The DareDevils wicketkeeper, however, was lucky to have survived a close run out call. The batting let the Knight Riders down again and the team management will rue the decision not to play Australian David Hussey.         
	The Knight Riders lost the better part of their batting before they could even cross 50. Only Sourav Ganguly (44 off 45 balls, 1x4, 2x6) provided some resistance as he held the innings together during the middle-overs.         
	Ajit Agarkars late surge saved them the ignominy of finishing below the 100-run mark. Forty-six runs came off the last five overs as the former India all-rounder used the long handle to good effect.         
	Sourav, denied a bat in their previous match against the same opposition, took the opportunity to showcase his resolve on his lucky ground. It was at the Wanderers that he made a sensational comeback in the 2006 Test series. A six off Ashish Nehra signalled his intentions Sunday as the former captain began to time the ball neatly.         
	Sourav, who opened the innings, added 36 for the fourth wicket with Yashpal Singh to put the team back on the rails after the initial setback. Yashpal collected a couple of hard-hit boundaries but a loss in concentration resulted in him holing out in the deep.         
	Amit Mishra dismissed both Yashpal and Wriddhiman Saha in his first over and followed it up with Moises Henriques in his next. The noose tightened around the Knight Riders and it was left to Sourav and Agarkars experience to restore some sanity.         
	The Knight Riders were content with taking the singles, with Sourav only opening out on a free-hit, clobbering Mishra over long-on for a massive six. Agarkar, too, found rhythm against Pradeep Sangwan, lofting him for a couple of boundaries.         
	Sourav departed once Dirk Nannes was back for his second spell, failing to pick the slower. The miscued slog went high at point. Agarkar then took a few chances with some uppish shots, to finish on a 29-ball 39.         
	A disappointing start had spoiled the momentum after being put into bat. Brendon McCullum began with a flourish pulling Ashish Nehra over square leg for a six of the matchs second ball. A ball later the Knight Riders captain departed, courtesy a horrendous leg before decision by umpire Suresh Shastri.         
	Nehra was the only one who had appealed once it landed on a good length and angled away. The ball was missing the off-stump by a distance as McCullum moved across to play it away on the leg side.         
	The momentary high for the Knights after the first six was over in a flash as Brad Hodge, the in-form batsman, gave catching practice to De Villiers at slip. Morne van Wyk departed in the next over and the Knight Riders, at nine, had lost three of their foreign recruits by the end of the second over.         
	Only a miracle from there on could have ensured the Knight Riders finished on a high. In the end it was clear the early setbacks had put a fatal drag on their efforts.

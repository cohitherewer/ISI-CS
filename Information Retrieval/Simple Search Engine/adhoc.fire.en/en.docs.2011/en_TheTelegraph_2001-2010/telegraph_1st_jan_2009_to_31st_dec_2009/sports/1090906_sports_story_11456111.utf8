The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jones comes up with plan
                                                   Jones comes up with plan
                      
	Melbourne: Former Australian batsman Dean Jones has offered his recipe to revive one-day Internationals suggesting a 40-over game with features of both Twenty20 and Test cricket.         
	Jones threw up two proposals  the first changing the one-dayers into Test-Twenty20 format, which he prefers, and the second playing it in four innings of 20 overs each.         
	Play Test-Twenty20 cricket. That is, both teams would have two innings. Each innings is 20 overs long and compulsory closure is enforced, he said.         
	(PTI)

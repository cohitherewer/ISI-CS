The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AIFF draws up a busy schedule 
                                                   AIFF draws up a busy schedule 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) is likely to implement the Plan B of the Goal 2011 Project that will enable the federation to keep the top footballers for exclusive use of the national team from June 2010 to January 2011.         
	India will play the Asia Cup in Qatar in January 2011.         
	In a press release on Thursday, the AIFF said the national team will be busy preparing for the Asia Cup from June 2010 to January 2011.         
	The I-League and the Federation Cup for the 2010-11 season are expected to be held after the Asia Cup.         
	For the 2009-10 season, the AIFF has planned frequent national camps, international tournaments and friendly matches for the senior team.         
	During this period, India will play the Nehru Cup (19 August to 30 August), SAFF Cup (December) and will visit either Spain or Portugal to play friendly matches.         
	As per the schedule released on Thursday, the national team players will remain busy in the camp for longer period this season. The AIFF is planning to start the I-League immediately after the Durand Cup in September. It is yet to announce the dates for the Federation Cup.         
	The Calcutta clubs, especially Mohun Bagan and East Bengal are unhappy about the scheduling of the national camps.         
	Mohun Bagan have already written to the AIFF asking them to release the list of national campers well before the start of the transfer season.

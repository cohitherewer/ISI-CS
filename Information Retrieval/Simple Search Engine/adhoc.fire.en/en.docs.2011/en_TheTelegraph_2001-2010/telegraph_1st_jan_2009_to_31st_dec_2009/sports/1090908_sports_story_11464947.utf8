                                                   Dinesh in quarters
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Indias Dinesh Kumar became the first Indian boxer to enter the quarter finals of the World championships in Milan when he outclassed Constantin Bejenaru of Romania on Monday.         
	Fighting from the blue corner, the light flyweight Indian boxer threw an array of punches to clinch a 19-7 verdict and set up a clash with Russias Artur Beterbiev for a place in the semi-finals.         
	Earlier in the day, lightweight pugilist Jai Bhagwans attempt to make the last eight ended in disappointment when the Asian silver medallist went down 3-9 to Eugen Burhard of Germany.         
	Dinesh, however, proved a better customer better than his rival and emerged a clear winner long before the bout could end.         
	I got lot of points from my straight punches, said the Indian boxer. My opponent was very skilful but his shorter stature came to my advantage to some extent.         
	Dinesh will now have to really do well to get into the medal bracket as Beterbiev is one of the favourites to win the gold. A silver medallist of the 2007 World championship, the Russian boxer also has two World Cup gold medals to his credit.         
	 I will try to do my best, said Dinesh. This championship has witnessed a series of upsets and there can always be an addition to the list, added the Indian pugilist. The chief coach GS Sandhu was also hopeful about Dineshs chances.         
	Olympic bronze medalist Vijender Kumar also has a chance to make the last eight on Tuesday night as he is pitted against Steve Rolls of Canada. We expect Vijender to finish into the medal bracket, said Sandhu.         
	In the last World championship, only one Indian  AR Lakra  could make the last eight grade.

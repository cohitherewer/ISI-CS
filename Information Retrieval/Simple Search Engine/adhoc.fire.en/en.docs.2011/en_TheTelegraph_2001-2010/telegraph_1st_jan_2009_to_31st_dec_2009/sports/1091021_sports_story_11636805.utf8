    - AUSTRALIANS ARRIVE IN MUMBAI FOR THE SEVEN-MATCH ODI SERIES                 Ricky Ponting                           
	Mumbai/Sydney: The Australian cricketers, fresh from their Champions Trophy triumph, arrived at the Shivaji Chhatrapati International Airport in Mumbai Tuesday afternoon for their high-profile seven-match ODI series against India.         
	The squad, led by Ricky Ponting, was escorted to the hotel in suburban Bandra under tight security. Six members of the 15-strong squad  Doug Bollinger, Nathan Hauritz, Brett Lee (all New South Wales Blues), Peter Siddle, Jon Holland and Cameron White (all Victoria Bushrangers)  are already in India for the Champions League Twenty20.         
	The visitors are scheduled to have practice sessions at the Mumbai Cricket Associations Bandra-Kurla Complex Wednesday and Thursday before leaving for Vadodara Friday afternoon for the first match. The first match is on Sunday.         
	Before boarding the flight for Mumbai, Ponting said that despite their Champions Trophy debacle, Mahendra Singh Dhonis men would be hard to beat in home conditions.         
	They will be particularly hard to beat in India. They always are. They definitely play a lot better at home than they do when they travel, Ponting told reporters on Monday.         
	India crashed out of the Champions Trophy in the group stage.         
	Ponting, however, said injuries to regular vice-captain Michael Clarke and batsman Callum Ferguson has disturbed the balance of the side and selection would be a major headache during the tour.         
	While Ferguson is out for a year with a knee injury, Clarke is battling a back problem but may join the squad in the latter part of the series. The selectors and myself are going to have a bit of thinking to do over the next few days about the batting line-up, Ponting said.         
	To their relief Shaun Marsh is back in the team after recovering from a hamstring injury that has kept him out since April but it would be quite a task for him to strike form immediately and knock off in-form Tim Paine from the opening slot.         
	Paine coming in has had a fair bit of success at the top of the order and given himself every opportunity to remain there, Ponting said.         
	You go back six or seven months, then Shaun was one of the up-and-coming batsmen in our Australian team and someone who has got a very good record at the top of the order for us, so weve got some tough decisions to make there.         
	But whichever way we go there we know weve got very good depth in our batting with someone like Shaun coming back in so hopefully we get it right on the morning of the first game, he added.         
	Asked about the surprise selection of rookie spinner Holland, who is currently in India playing in the Champions League Twenty20, Ponting said he has seen him for only 20 minutes in the nets.         
	Ive seen 20 minutes of him bowling in the nets leading up to the Boxing Day Test last year, thats as much as Ive seen of Jon, Ponting said.         
	He gets good raps from all the other Victorian guys ... everyone believes hes got a good future. Its great to have a young cricketer around the group, especially a young spinner making a tour of India, Ponting added.         
	The 22-year-old is part of the Victoria Bushrangers squad and Ponting hoped that the youngster would come good when presented with an opportunity.         
	You cant help but learn when you get over there and bowl in those conditions and bowl to better players like Jon will be doing, he said.         
	Hell be bowling to all the Australian batsmen over the next few weeks and he might get an opportunity to bowl to some very good players of spin in the Indian batsmen, so some great opportunities lie ahead for Jon. Im looking forward to spending some time with him over the next few weeks, he added.         
	The other matches of the series are scheduled in Nagpur (October 28), Delhi (October 31), Mohali (November 2), Hyderabad (November 5), Guwahati (November 8) and Mumbai (November 11).

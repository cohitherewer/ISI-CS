                                                   Months of waiting will end soon, says a delighted RP
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: Rudra Pratap Singh was asleep when The Telegraph called him at the Garden Court, in East London, to inform him of his selection for next months World T20 in England.         
	Bhaisaab, bahut hi achchi baat hai... Im very happy... The months of waiting to again play for India will end soon, RP said, on Monday, his tone becoming clearer with each word.         
	RPs last India appearance had been in November, 2008, during the ODIs against England at home.         
	I suppose my performances in the IPL (for the Deccan Chargers) have helped... Ive been putting in everything... Yeh achchi baat hai ki reward mila, RP added.         
	RP had been one of the biggest successes in the inaugural edition of the World T20, in South Africa, 20 months ago. The tournament was won by India.         
	Ill be looking to improve on my 2007 effort (12 wickets, one behind topper Umar Gul)... Conditions in England help swing and swing is my forte... Bahut excited hoon, RP maintained.         
	RP, in fact, had a great summer in England during Indias tour there two years ago. Yes, thats going to add to my confidence... As a bowler, I know what to expect, the 23-year-old left-arm quick remarked.         
	That RP was very strongly placed to make the XV had already been reported in these columns. He has come in for Munaf Patel, whod been in the T20 squad which travelled to New Zealand earlier this year.         
	RP, who made his debut in the rather eventful Greg Chappell era, is in his fourth year as an India cricketer and is captain Mahendra Singh Dhonis buddy No.1.         
	With only one wicket-keeper (Dhoni) picked, via a tele-conference, Dinesh Karthik hasnt found a place.         
	Karthik had been the XVIth player in New Zealand.

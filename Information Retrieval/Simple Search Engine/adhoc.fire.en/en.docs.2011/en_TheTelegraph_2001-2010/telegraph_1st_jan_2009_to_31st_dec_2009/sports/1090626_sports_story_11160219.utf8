The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania moves up in doubles
                                                   Sania moves up in doubles
                      
	London: In a major upset, French Open champions Indias Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy of Czech Republic crashed out of the Wimbledon mens doubles even as Sania Mirza and Chia-Jung Chuang battled hard to make it to the second round in the womens, here on Thursday.         
	Paes and his Czech partner went down to the unseeded US pair of James Blake and Mardy Fish 4-6, 4-6, 3-6 that brought an end to their campaign in the first round itself.         
	However, there was some cheer for India as Sania and her Chinese Taipei partner defeated Americans Jill Craybas and Carly Gullickson 6-4, 6-2 following a 79-minute battle.         
	Lot was expected from Paes and Dloughy after their triumph in the French Open. However, the third-seeded Indo-Czech duo failed to match their American opponents and went down in one hour 49 minutes.         
	The third-seeds paid for 11 double faults and 12 unforced errors compared to their rivals one.         
	They also converted just three of the 19 breakpoints while Blake and Fishs converted six of the 12.         
	Sania and Chuang faced stiff competition from unseeded Craybas and Gullickson in the first set.         
	The 15th seeded Indo-Taipei pair had to wait till the eighth breakpoint of the fourth game to get their first break.         
	The Americans saved seven back-to-back breakpoints but the effort wasnt enough against their equally unrelenting rivals.         
	However, the compliment was returned in the next game as Americans converted their second chance.         
	Sania and Chuang were, however, unfazed and broke their rivals at love in the sixth game to get back the lead.         
	But the Americans regrouped and broke their fancied rivals once more to remain in contention.         
	The seeded pair relied on its experience to break Craybas and Gullickson at love in the 10th game and wrapped up the first set.         
	In the second set, Sania and Chuang dominated and broke their rivals in the sixth and eighth games to march to the second round.         
	They next face the winners of the match between Lourdes Dominguez Lino/ Aranta Parra Santonja and Alla Kudryavtseva/ Monica Niculescu.           (PTI)

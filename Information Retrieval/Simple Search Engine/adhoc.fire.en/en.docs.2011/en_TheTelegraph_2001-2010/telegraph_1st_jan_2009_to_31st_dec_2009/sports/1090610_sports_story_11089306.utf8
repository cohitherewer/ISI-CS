The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | To lose somebody of Symmos calibre leaves a big hole: Ricky
                                                     To lose somebody of Symmos calibre leaves a big hole: Ricky
    - Defending champions India have a very good chance, says Australia captain           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ricky Ponting                                 
	Nottingham: Ricky Ponting was absolutely gutted after Australias first-round exit from the World T20, the only major tournament which hasnt been won by his team.         
	Australias captain, however, did present himself before the media at Trent Bridge (late on Monday). Later, he briefly spoke to The Telegraph separately.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Australias unexpected exit         
	Yeah, it has been unexpected. I had very high expectations and a good squad of players... One just cant afford to make the mistakes we did... We lost wickets early and allowed the Sri Lankan spinners to dictate... When we bowled, we gave away too many extras.         
	On Australias inability to impact in T20 cricket         
	Wish I knew the reason... Weve now lost five T20 Internationals in a row... We stumble in the big matches and on the big moments... As long as you dont get too funky and try to play differently, you should be fine.         
	Australias T20 squad         
	On paper, I reckon we were as good as any other team... The selectors picked the best 15...         
	Having been in the group of death         
	We knew the West Indies and Sri Lanka are very good teams... Knew that if we made mistakes, they would make us pay... Really, I cant tell you how disappointed I am at us going out of the World T20.         
	Key all-rounder Andrew Symonds being sent home, as a disciplinary measure, on the eve of the tournament         
	Hes one of the best around and had played in the IPL... But his not being there cant be an excuse... It was an opportunity for the others to step up and they didnt... I didnt hear any talk about Symmo not being there in the last couple of days (in the dressing room) and, so, I assume the issue wasnt playing on anybodys mind... But, yes, to lose somebody of his calibre leaves a big hole.         
	Being undone by Ajantha Mendis (three for 20), who played against Australia for the first time         
	Wed seen his footage, but in T20, youve got to play in a particular manner... Mendis made an impact, yes... Wed known the Sri Lankan spinners would be a challenge.         
	Sanath Jayasuriya being the only player in the World T20 who made his debut in the Eighties (late 1989)         
	(Laughs) I didnt know that! Hes going to be a key player for Sri Lanka and Id been happy when we got him early (for 2).         
	Brett Lees form         
	He didnt get as many wickets as he wouldve liked, but he has been bowling quick... Hell get better as he has more matches under his belt.         
	Very few Australians having played in the recent IPL, which appears to have helped players of other teams         
	Maybe not playing made a difference, but I was happy with the skills of our guys... Whether more (Australians) played or not is irrelevant... We knew we had to beat Sri Lanka and we didnt... Theres no point making excuses... Id been happy with our lead-up to the World T20, happy with our warm-up matches... (After a pause) Because of commitments with Australia, I wouldnt have been available for more than two weeks... Dont think that wouldve made much of a difference.         
	Having been missed by the Kolkata Knight Riders         
	Yeah? Is that so?         
	Whether hell be wearing the Knights colours next year after giving the IPLs second edition, in South Africa, a miss         
	Hopefully, yes... Id certainly like to play.         
	Teams which have the best chance in the World T20         
	India, the defending champions, have a very good chance... South Africa are a good all-round side... The West Indies, on their day, could do it... My best wishes are there for the teams moving into the next (Super Eight) stage.         
	On his favourite         
	Id been hoping the guys in (Australias) yellow-and-green colours would win!         
	Looking ahead         
	Weve got to have a chat and, then, quickly move on and focus on Test cricket (Ashes). Its a test of character for us now... Weve got time on our hands and time to get used to playing the red ball well.         
	Lastly, the challenge for him         
	Its to ensure that the players whore also part of the Ashes squad get over this quickly...               
	Wont get carried away: Sangakkara                   Kumar Sangakkara      
	Sri Lankas captain (and MoM) Kumar Sangakkara also spoke late on Monday.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Sri Lankas game plan         
	We stuck to the basics...         
	Defeating Australia         
	Feels great... We took to the match believing that we could win and we did... We need to take that belief and confidence forward... However, we wont get carried away and wont begin to look too far ahead... Cricket is a great leveller and any team could get surprised.         
	What went wrong for Australia?         
	I wont tell the Australians how to play... Defeats happen.         
	Starting his innings as captain with a win         
	(Smiles) Im lucky that theres a great think tank... Mahela (Jayawardene), Sanath (Jayasuriya), (Muttiah) Muralidharan, (Tillekaratne) Dilshan and the support staff... Of course, there are a few areas where I need to brush up and a few areas where the team has to brush up...         
	Whether the IPL helped         
	Absolutely... Even if some of our players didnt play regularly, they still rubbed shoulders with some of the best and learnt what it takes to deliver on a competitive stage.         
	On Ajantha Mendis         
	Its an advantage to have somebody with a bit of mystery... The Australians hadnt seen him before and he bowled very well... Hed bowled well in the IPL too, but didnt get many chances (with the Knights)... He should have, for hed been bowling well.         
	Spinners making an impact in the World T20         
	Im not surprised... The less the pace on the ball, the more work batsmen are having to do... Records will show that, traditionally, spinners have been successful in T20 in England... Its good for us, for spin is our strength.         
	Demonstration by pro-Tamil supporters outside Trent Bridge         
	Were here to play cricket and thats our focus.         
	Finally, what makes the difference?         
	Not just the skills, but attitude and the way one thinks.                 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT IN NOTTINGHAM

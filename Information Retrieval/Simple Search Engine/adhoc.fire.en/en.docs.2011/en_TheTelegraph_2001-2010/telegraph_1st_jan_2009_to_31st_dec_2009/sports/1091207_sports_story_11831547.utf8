                                                                                                                       7                                      Viru: Am grateful to Sourav
                      
	Mumbai: Virender Sehwag expressed his gratitude for Sourav Ganguly Sunday, saying it was the former India captain who instilled confidence in him by giving him the opportunity to open the innings.         
	I shall always be grateful to Sourav. He was the one who pushed me up from the middle-order to open the innings. He told me that if I failed to perform as an opener I will be shifted back to the middle-order, Sehwag said about the turning point of his career.         
	The Delhi dasher cracked a blistering 293 in the third and final Test against Sri Lanka to help India win the match and seal the series 2-0.         
	Sehwags 254-ball innings earned him the Man of the Match and the Player of the Series awards and helped India become the No.1 Test side in the world.         
	Sehwag, who has a couple of triple centuries under his belt, ranked the 293 as the third best knock of his career.         
	This will be my third best knock. I wasnt thinking anything; my mind was very blank. I just waited for the bad balls. In the dressing room they were saying I was hitting the good balls too but when you look at it from my point of view, I was just hitting the bad balls! he said.

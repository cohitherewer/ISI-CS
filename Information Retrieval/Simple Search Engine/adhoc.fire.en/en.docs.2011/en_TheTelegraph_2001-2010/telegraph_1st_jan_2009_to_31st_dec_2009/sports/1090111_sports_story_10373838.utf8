The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ford keen on England post
                                                   Ford keen on England post
                      
	Durban: Graham Ford is interested in the England job following the midweek sacking of Peter Moores, the Kent coach said on Saturday.         
	However, the former South Africa supremo said he would only accept the position if he was certain the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) had canvassed the opinions of the players.         
	Anybody would be interested in being coach of England but I would need to find out more, Ford said from his Durban home.         
	Im not the kind of person to make a decision overnight and being involved in the West Indies (tour later this month) would certainly be a rush job.         
	If I were to be considered the ECB would have to do their homework and make certain the players are fully behind me.         
	The 48-year-old Ford coached South Africa from 1999-2001. More recently, he refused to take the coachs job for India after being chosen for the post.           (REUTERS)

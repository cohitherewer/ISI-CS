The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Haddin salvo at Vettori 
                                                   Haddin salvo at Vettori 
                      
	Melbourne: Australia wicketkeeper Brad Haddin has hit back at New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori for questioning his integrity during the visitors final-ball-win in the first one-dayer against Ricky Pontings team.         
	Vettori had hinted that Haddin had not acted in good faith in the contentious dismissal of Neil Broom Sunday.         
	Haddins gloves were in front of the wicket when a Michael Clarke delivery was judged to have crashed on to the stumps. I am pretty disappointed in Dan that he didnt have the decency to come and speak to me after the game if he had an issue with it rather than air his thoughts in a press conference, Haddin said.         
	The polite, decent thing to do would have been to come and ask me. He has played a lot of cricket now. He knows too well what happens with these situations, he said.         
	Vettori had claimed Haddin knew something was wrong with the dismissal forcing Haddin to fire a salvo at the rival skipper.         
	I thought it was a bit low. He could have come and talked to me. I was very shocked after reading the paper that he didnt come and speak to me. I am pretty disappointed that he has questioned my integrity, the wicketkeeper said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its 55-45 for India, says Kiran More
                                                     Its 55-45 for India, says Kiran More
  - I wouldnt have brought Rahul back for half-a-dozen or so matches         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Kiran More                                 
	Vadodara: In Kiran Mores opinion, India have a 55-45 advantage going into the seven-match ODI series against Australia.         
	I expect a close contest, with India having a 55-45 advantage... Australia have shown that their bench strength is good and, so, I wouldnt necessarily read too much into Michael Clarkes absence... Hell be missed, yes, but somebody else could put his hand up and do the job, the former India wicket-keeper and one-time (controversial) chief selector told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking in his KRZ Sports Management office on Friday afternoon, More said: To drive home the advantage, though, well have to bowl and field very well... Good batting alone wont do...         
	Asked if he wouldve recalled former captain Rahul Dravid for a handful of ODIs only, More replied: I wouldnt have dropped him when he did get excluded (late 2007)... But if Id done that two years ago, then I wouldnt have brought him back for half-a-dozen or so matches...         
	Endorsing teammate and ex-India captain Ravi Shastris stand that Ishant Sharma be kept away from limited overs cricket, particularly T20, More said: Absolutely... T20 is killing bowlers and the selectors have to do a delicate balancing act. They just dont have a choice.         
	More, incidentally, is still with the Indian Cricket League (ICL), even though it now exists on paper only. Im busy doing a few things for Zee (the ICL promoters) and Im happy, he pointed out.         
	Clearly, Mores in no hurry to seek clemency from the Board.

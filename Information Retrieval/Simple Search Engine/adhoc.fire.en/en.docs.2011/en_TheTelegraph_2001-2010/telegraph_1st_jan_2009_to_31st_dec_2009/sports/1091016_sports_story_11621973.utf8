                                                   IWF faces 4-year ban
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Crisis in Indian weightlifting further deepened on Thursday when three more lifters tested positive for doping raising fears the Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWF) could be banned for four years by the international federation.         
	The three lifters  Harbhajan Singh, Rajesh Kumar and Bijaya Devi  according to Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWF) secretary Baldev Gulati, failed the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) tests during the preparatory camp for the Commonwealth meet starting in Malaysia this week.         
	Last month, two leading weightlifters like Shailaja Pujari and Vicky Batta failed out of competition dope tests.         
	As the news about more lifters failing dope test trickled in, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) got down to the damage control act and formed a four-member committee headed by KP Singh to look into the matter.         
	The other three members are  Dr Manmohan Singh, Munish Chandra and Sushil Salwan, a legal expert. The committee will look into the matter and will recommend necessary actions against the players and the federation, an IOA official said.         
	The committee has been asked to submit their reports in the next one week, the official said.         
	But given the rules of the international body, IWF are unlikely to escape a four-year ban from the international arena.         
	According to an IWF official, as per Code no 12.3.1.1 of the world body, a member nation could be banned for four years if four or more lifters from that particular country test positive in a span of 12 months.         
	All the tainted lifters have asked for the B sample test.

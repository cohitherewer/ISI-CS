                                                   Rumblings in Lankan cricket
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: President Mahinda Rajapakses decision to appoint Somachandra de Silva and Nishantha Ranatunga as chairman and secretary, respectively, of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), has caused rumblings and bewilderment within the island-nations cricket fraternity.         
	Given the sports importance there, the top appointments are traditionally made by the countrys President, though the sports minister may have a say too.         
	In the latest instance, one learns sports minister Gamini Lokuge was only informed and not consulted.         
	Lokuge, whod been instrumental in the strong-headed Arjuna Ranatungas removal as SLC chairman, last December, cant therefore be very pleased with Thursdays developments.         
	Rumblings have started because Somachandra, a one-time stand-in captain and SLCs schools development officer, is known to be sympathetic towards Arjuna, whose stand on a number of issues alienated many.         
	Also, Nishantha is the youngest of the Ranatunga brothers.         
	Theres bewilderment because the appointments have sent confusing signals.         
	Is the President, for example, trying to mollify Arjuna, a member of Parliament and a former deputy minister?         
	Over the years, Somachandras views on SLC havent been much different from Arjunas... There are misgivings over Nishantha too... He could be influenced by his elder brother, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking from Colombo on Saturday, the gentleman added: Then, its hardly a secret that one of the new interim committee members, (former quick) Pramodaya Wickramasinghe, has always been pro-Arjuna...         
	With pro-Arjuna elements getting to have a significant say in SLCs running, chief executive Duleep Mendis may just get marginalised somewhat.         
	At one time, Mendis and Arjuna (former captains both) were pretty close to each other, but differences cropped up some years ago  specifically after Mendis became the chief executive.         
	Mendis is known to be efficient and, despite frequent changes at the top, has been providing continuity on the administrative front.         
	Internationally, he has been the face of SLC in recent years.         
	As for Arjuna, he has challenged his ouster and his fundamental rights application will be heard by the Supreme Court on May 25.         
	Thursdays developments notwithstanding, theres nothing to suggest that Arjuna intends withdrawing his application, which has named bete noire Lokuge as the No.1 respondent.

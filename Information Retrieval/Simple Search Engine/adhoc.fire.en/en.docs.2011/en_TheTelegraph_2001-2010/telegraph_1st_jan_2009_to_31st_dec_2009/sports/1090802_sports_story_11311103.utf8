The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pak wants assurance on playing matches in India 
                                                   Pak wants assurance on playing matches in India 
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: Upset by the hostile attitude of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and wary of its intentions, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has sought an assurance that New Delhi would give the green signal for the Pakistan teams trip to India during the 2011 World Cup.         
	That assurance has, so far, not been given.         
	It appears both the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the BCCI are playing for time, hoping that relations between the neighbours improve.         
	However, there has been nothing of late to suggest that Islamabad and New Delhi are actually moving towards quickly improving bilateral ties.         
	Also, there seems to be no initiative from the ICC to hold a dialogue with the two governments, perhaps on the lines of the exercise undertaken by former ICC president Ehsan Mani, which led to the fabulous Revival Series in March-April 2004.         
	The BCCI has done everything to humiliate the PCB on the issue of shifting the 14 World Cup matches originally allotted to Pakistan Now, the PCB has sought an assurance that the Indian government would grant visas and ensure security for its players, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking from Lahore on Saturday evening, the gentleman added: I dont foresee a situation where Pakistans league matches are going to be scheduled only in Sri Lanka or Bangladesh. After all, what if the team makes the knockout stage? Will the World Cup then go ahead without Pakistan? Remember, besides the final, one semi-final and one quarter final have been given to India         
	Incidentally, after 26/11, the PCB is concerned that Mumbai will be hosting the final. Not that it can do anything about it.         
	If Pakistan makes the final, then the team will have to play on the Shiv Senas home turf Of course, its very worrying, the well-placed source pointed out.         
	The Shiv Sena is opposed to all forms of contact with Pakistan and, in the past, has done its bit to ensure Indo-Pak cricket relations take a hit.         
	From on-field vandalism and demonstrations to threats, the Shiv Sainiks havent stopped at anything.         
	In any case, post 26/11, ties are back in the cold storage.         
	Meanwhile, the PCB is set to drop arbitration proceedings against the ICC as it has reportedly been assured of even the gate receipts from the 14 matches which have been relocated.         
	Of those 14, the lions share (eight) has gone to Big Brother India.         
	The ICC has said no to neutral venues (Dubai, Abu Dhabi) and the World Cup secretariat will stay in Mumbai and not go back to Lahore In the circumstances, its best to accept the financial package and press for an assurance on matters where New Delhi comes into the picture, the gentleman added.         
	Technically, the PCB remains a co-host and, so, is assured of getting $10.5 million from the ICC. The gate receipts will be an add-on.         
	Yet another worry for the PCB is the possibility of its own government not giving permission to the Younis Khans to travel to India!         
	No wonder PCB chairman Ejaz Butt is looking older by the day.         
	Footnote: It couldnt be confirmed, but other well-placed sources are insisting that the BCCI did a volte-face on neutral venues during meetings in London around the middle of June. Thats not all, it forced Sri Lanka and Bangladesh to fall in line, thereby isolating the PCB.

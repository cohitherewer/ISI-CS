The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Blatter says sorry to Ireland
                                                                                                                       7                                      Blatter says sorry to Ireland
                      
	Cape Town: Fifa president Sepp Blatter apologised to Ireland on Wednesday for revealing that the countrys football association had asked for a 33rd place at next years World Cup in South Africa.         
	Blatter said he regretted telling a football business conference in Johannesburg that the Irish had asked for an extra place at the World Cup finals after their controversial elimination in their qualifying playoff with France.         
	I regret what I created by what I said and Im sorry about the headlines. The Irish were very sporting people when they came to see us at Fifa. Im very sorry about that, the president of soccers world governing body said at a news conference in Cape Town on Wednesday.         
	Meanwhile, France striker Thierry Henry could be banned from the start of the World Cup finals next year after Blatter said his blatant handball against Ireland would be investigated by the world body.         
	If Fifas Disciplinary Committee rules against Henry, who handled the ball in the build-up to Frances crucial goal in the playoff in Paris last month that saw them secure their place in the finals, they could impose a match ban that could see him miss the start of the finals in South Africa next June. The disciplinary committee will open a case into the behaviour of Thierry Henry in the match against Ireland, Blatter said.         
	The disciplinary committee does have the power to ban the player and the fact a case has been opened against him suggests he could well be sanctioned with a ban from Frances next competitive matches which will be at the finals. Blatter also told a news conference there would be no change in the way matches would be officiated at the World Cup next year, with a plan to have two additional referees behind each goal not sanctioned at Wednesdays extraordinary meeting of the Fifa executive committee.         
	Interpol, said Blatter, would create a new task force to deal with illegal betting in sport and in particular in soccer.         
	On Monday he said at the Soccerex business convention in Johannesburg that two additional assistants placed behind each goal would aid the referee in decision-making and he strongly suggested he would like to see them at the World Cup.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhupathi,   Paes in summit   clash
                                                   Bhupathi,   Paes in summit   clash
                                  
	New York: One Indian is sure to lay hands on the US Open mens doubles trophy as Davis Cup teammates Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes would clash against each other in the summit clash along with their respective partners.         
	Bhupathi and his Bahamian partner Mark Knowles, seeded third, eased into the final with a 6-4, 6-2 semi-final win over fifth seeds Max Mirnyi of Belarus and Andy Ram of Israel at Flushing Meadows Wednesday.         
	Earlier, fourth seeds Paes and Czech Lukas Dlouhy upset top seeds Mike and Bob Bryan 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (8-6) in the other semi-final.         
	In the tight first set of mens doubles second semi-final, Bhupathi and Knowles converted the only chance they had and saved a breakpoint on their own serve to take lead.         
	Meanwhile, bidding for his second Grand Slam title of the year, Indias Yuki Bhambri stormed into the boys singles quarter finals with a 6-4, 6-3 win over local lad Jack Sock in the third round.

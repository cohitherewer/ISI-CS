	Calcutta: The 16-member archery contingent bagged three gold and four silver medals in the second Asian Grand Prix meet in Tehran on Saturday, according to information received here on Monday.         
	The mens recurve team of Tarundeep Rai, Muni Ram Tirkey and Kapil, took the gold medal beating Iran 217-211 in the final. Punya Prabha, V. Pranitha and Reena Kumari, the womens recurve team, defeated Iran 198-194 in the final.         
	Compound archer L. Haridas Singh earned India the third gold medal in an individual event, when he annihilated Hungarys Robert Bojti in the tie breaker after the two tied 109-109 in the final.         
	Singh shot a 10 as against Bojtis 9 in the tie-breaker. The mens and womens compound teams lost to Iran in the final. The men lost 220-227 while the women went down 207-208.         
	Olympian Tarundeep Rai, perhaps the most experienced in the field, could get only a silver medal losing to Irans Milad Vaziri Teymoorlooei at 107-108 in the mens recurve individual event final.         
	Compound women archer Sweety Kumari too failed in the final going down to Seyedeh Vida Halimian Avval of Iran 102-108 to settle for silver. Tirkey and Sushma (both individual recurve) lost to Nadar M. and Zahara Nemati of Iran respectively in the bronze medal play-off.         
	All other medals went to host Iran which emerged the best in the four-day tournament attended by six nations and 60 archers.

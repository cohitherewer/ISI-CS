	London: Twice Olympic 10,000m champion Kenenisa Bekele has his sights set on setting a fourth world indoor record in Birmingham, England next year.         
	The Ethiopian will race over 3,000m, the distance at which he won his only world indoor title in 2006, at the February 20 Grand Prix at the National Indoor Arena (NIA) where he has run three of his five personal best times on the indoor circuit.         
	Five years ago I broke the world record in the 5,000 at the NIA and I also broke the 2,000 and two-mile records at the same arena so its definitely a track I enjoy running on, Bekele said in a statement from the organisers.         
	The three indoor world records he set in Birmingham all still stand.           (REUTERS)

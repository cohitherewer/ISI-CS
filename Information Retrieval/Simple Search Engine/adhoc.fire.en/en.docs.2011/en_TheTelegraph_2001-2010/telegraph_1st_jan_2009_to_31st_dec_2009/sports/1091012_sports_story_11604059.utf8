	Trainer Cooji Katraks ward Versaki kept his date with the 2,000m Nanoli Stud Pune Derby on Sunday. However, the victory of the 6-4 favourite was not without a hiccup. The three-year-old had to go through an ordeal of winning the race again in the stewards room, following a dual objection. C. Rajendra partnered the Verglas-Ghassak son.RESULTS

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger Woods stays in lead
                                                   Tiger Woods stays in lead
                      
	Chaska: Tiger Woods stayed calm in the face of charging rivals and an impending storm to hold a two-shot lead over Padraig Harrington and Yang Yong-eun of South Korea after Saturdays third round of the US PGA.         
	Woods, who began another windy day at Hazeltine with a four-stroke lead over a group of five players, shot one-under-par 71 for an eight-under total of 208.         
	The 33-year-old American has never lost when he has carried a lead into the final round of a Major, and all 14 of his Major championship victories have come in this fashion.         
	Meanwhile, a sub-par card continued to elude Jeev Milkha Singh, who turned in two-over 74 in his penultimate round to slip a rung to tied 49th. (Agencies)

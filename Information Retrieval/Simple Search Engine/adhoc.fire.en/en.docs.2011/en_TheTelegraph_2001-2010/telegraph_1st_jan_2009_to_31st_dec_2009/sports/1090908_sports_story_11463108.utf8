The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | New Zealand looking to carry form in ODIs
                                                   New Zealand looking to carry form in ODIs
                      
	Colombo: New Zealand will look to carry their form from their back-to-back T20 triumphs when Daniel Vettoris men take on Sri Lanka in the Compaq Cup cricket tri-series opener here Tuesday.         
	India are the third team in the tournament and the Mahendra Singh Dhonis start their campaign against the Black Caps on September 11.         
	After the battering of the Test series, which the hosts won 2-0, the Black Caps managed a morale-lifting clean sweep in the T20s.         
	However, the players from both sides would have had little time to adjust to the 50-over format.         
	The T20 triumphs did a world of good for the New Zealanders and Brendon McCullum, whose performance with the bat is crucial to their prospects in the tournament, said they would be a force to reckon with in the tri-series.         
	We were disappointed with the Test matches but the way we came back (in the T20s) was significant and gave us a lot of confidence, he said.         
	All in all, the team is shaping up pretty well at the moment and hopefully we will start well in the first one-dayer, he said.         
	McCullum and Jesse Ryder have been in good nick and the burly left-hander in fact went on to win the Man of the Series award in the T20s.         
	So confident are the Black Caps that they believe they have sorted out the enigma called Ajantha Mendis.         
	Hes going to be a tough proposition in the one-dayers, but the guys have played him pretty well. If we can negate his ability to tear through batting line-ups, it will set us up to be a bit more aggressive, McCullum said.         
	Sri Lanka, on the other hand, are sulking from the twin defeats and captain Kumar Sangakkara has told teammates that he was far from happy with the teams showing in the T20s.         
	I have to say they outplayed us, the Lanka captain had said after the T20 defeats. Our batting unit needs to start firing, he added, placing the onus on the inconsistent willow-wielders.         
	Another worry for the home side is that Muttiah Muralidharan is in some doubt after not recovering entirely from a groin strain sustained on the final day of the SSC Test, and both teams will keenly await news on his fitness Tuesday.         
	From the Indian point of view, the tri-series provides Dhoni and his men an opportunity to win their first tourney in a multi-nation event here in 11 years.         
	India last won the final of a major one-day event on Lankan soil in 1998 and had shared the rain-marred ICC Champions Trophy with the hosts in 2002.

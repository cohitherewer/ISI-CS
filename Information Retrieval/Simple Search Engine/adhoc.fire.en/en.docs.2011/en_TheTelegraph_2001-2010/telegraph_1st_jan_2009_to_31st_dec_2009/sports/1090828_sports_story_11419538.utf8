The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United look to fight fire with fire
                                                   United look to fight fire with fire
                      
	London: A tactical switch by Arsene Wenger has made free-scoring Arsenal look like title contenders before Saturdays Premier League trip to champions Manchester United.         
	Arsenals attack-minded squad have been complemented by Wengers change from a 4-4-1-1 to a 4-3-3 formation this season that has brought 10 goals and victories in their first two league matches.         
	The Londoners also recorded a 5-1 aggregate win over Celtic to qualify for the Champions League group stages.         
	Uniteds 5-0 thrashing of Wigan Athletic last Saturday suggested they were beginning to adapt to life without Cristiano Ronaldo after going into the game on the back of a shock 0-1 defeat at promoted Burnley.         
	Arsenal, leaders Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester City and Chelsea have all made 100 per cent starts to the season and Wenger expects another tough battle for the title.         
	Two years ago we had 83 points and didnt win the title. Last year Liverpool had 86 points and didnt win the title, Wenger told the clubs website.         
	Lets not speculate on any weakness of any other team but just look how high that level is and that it means we need to be super-consistent.         
	Arsenals Champions League hopes were wrecked last season when Ronaldo produced a dazzling semi-final second leg display at the Emirates.         
	Uniteds 4-1 aggregate win underlined a chasm in quality between the two rivals but the availability of Andrei Arshavin and the return to fitness of Eduardo da Silva and Tomas Rosicky should make Arsenal a tougher proposition on Saturday.         
	Gunners captain Cesc Fabregas is doubtful with a tight hamstring and Theo Walcott is out with a back injury.         
	United, boosted by the return of defender Nemanja Vidic from injury, are still without goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar.         
	Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez has demanded more from his squad ahead of Saturdays trip to Bolton Wanderers after losing twice in three games this season.         
	Clearly the team... has to improve, Benitez told the clubs website.         
	Chelsea, unbeaten under Carlo Ancelotti, host a Burnley side who have won their last two league games while Tottenham will be favourites at home to Birmingham City.

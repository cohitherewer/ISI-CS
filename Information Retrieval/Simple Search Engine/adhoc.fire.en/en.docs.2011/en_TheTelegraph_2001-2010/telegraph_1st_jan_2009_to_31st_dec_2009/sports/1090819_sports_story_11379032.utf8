                                                   Rohan happy to be back
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A day after the ex-Indian Cricket League player Rohan Gavaskar was named among the 35 probables for the Bengal team, he was at the Eden on Tuesday.         
	He stepped into Eden Gardens nearly after two-and-a- half years and obviously had every reason to be happy.         
	I never deserted Bengal, he said on Tuesday. I was with the ICL for two years, but now I am back and I am happy to be back, he said.         
	Rohan said that it would not be difficult for him to adapt to the four-day format. I agree ICL was Twenty20 and I was out of the four-day version for a couple of years. But then I have played first-class cricket for 11 years and have the calibre to adapt myself.         
	Ridiculing those who questioned his commitment to Bengal cricket, he said that he has performed well for Bengal.

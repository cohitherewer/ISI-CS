The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United face Barnsley
                                                   United face Barnsley
                      
	London: Almost 20 years after his FA Cup goal for Manchester United probably saved Alex Fergusons job, Mark Robins will try and knock his former manager out of the League Cup on Tuesday.         
	Robins goal in a 1-0 victory over Nottingham Forest in January 1990 came at a time when the pressure was on Ferguson after three years at Old Trafford without a trophy. If Robins had not scored that FA Cup goal and United lost to Forest, the club may well have fired Ferguson.         
	Now, defending League Cup champions United make a rare visit to Barnsleys Oakwell Stadium, where Robins is the new manager and the League Championship club has a sellout crowd and the financial bonus of live TV coverage.         
	Both Arsenal and Liverpool are likely to field mostly backup players at the Emirates on Wednesday. But the fact that one of the leading contenders will be going out of the competition is a bonus for their rivals.

                                                   Good news for Bhutia
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Mohun Bagan Monday failed to stop Bhaichung Bhutia from playing the I-League for East Bengal when the All India Football Federation (AIFF)-appointed arbitrator rejected the clubs plea for a stay order on the Indian captain.         
	Bagan, according to arbitrator Amarendra Sharan, appealed for a 15-day stay on the interim relief granted to Bhaichung to play for a club of his own choice.         
	Had Bagans appeal been upheld, Bhaichung would have missed the coming two fixtures, against Mahindra United and JCT. The arbitrator has set October 28 as the next date of hearing.         
	Meanwhile, Our Correspondent adds from Mumbai that inclement weather cut short East Bengals practice session here Monday.         
	Later in the day, East Bengal were boosted by the arrival of Yusif Yakubu.

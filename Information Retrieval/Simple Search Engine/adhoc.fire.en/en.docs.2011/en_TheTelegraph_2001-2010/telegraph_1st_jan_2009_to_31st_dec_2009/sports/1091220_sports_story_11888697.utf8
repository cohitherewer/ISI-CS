The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | City set to sack Hughes 
                                                                                                                       7                                      City set to sack Hughes

	Manchester City are close to confirming that Mark Hughes has been sacked as manager to be replaced by former Inter Milan coach Roberto Mancini.         
	Speculation over Hughes future intensified after Man Citys tepid 3-0 defeat to fellow top four hopefuls Tottenham in midweek, a result that left City with one victory from their previous 10 Premier League matches.         
	Rumours spread around Eastlands during Citys 4-3 victory over Sunderland on Saturday.         
	Citys owner, Sheikh Mansour, is believed to have grown frustrated over recent form after he had sanctioned a 200m team-building project.         
	Despite early season promise City have lost their way in recent months and though the reverse to Tottenham was only their second defeat in the league this season a string of draws appears to have cost Hughes his job.         
	Reports in Italy emerged that Mancini, who took Inter to the Serie A title during his time at the San Siro, has held advanced talks over taking over at Eastlands and Mansour is ready to act now to give the Italian time to bed in ahead of the January transfer window.         
	Hughes took over at City in June 2008 and has faced extreme scrutiny since the club went under the ownership of the Abu Dhabi United Group.         
	On Friday Carlos Tvez backed Hughes, calling for his manager to be given more time as speculation of his departure grew.         
	The reason I joined was because I believe in his vision, said Tvez. I believe in what he had to say. I support him 100 per cent.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

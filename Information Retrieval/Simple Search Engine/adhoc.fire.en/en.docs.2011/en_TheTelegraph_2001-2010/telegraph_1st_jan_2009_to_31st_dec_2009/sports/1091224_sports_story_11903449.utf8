	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly, who really needs no introduction, spoke to The Telegraph at his Behala residence on Wednesday afternoon.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q You helped build this team, which is No.1 in Tests and No.2 in ODIs. You must be delighted with the way things have been taken forward...         
	A Yes, indeed... Im not too sure about the one-day team as yet, but its a fantastic achievement to become the No.1 in Test cricket... Australias decline (in Tests) has, of course, helped... Theyve been hit hard by the retirements of Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath, Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden... Im glad that the BCCI is looking to drop a couple of ODIs and playing two Tests, instead, against South Africa... This year, weve played too few (only six).         
	Whats the difference between this team and the earlier ones?         
	Anil (Kumble) and I have retired, but otherwise, the Test team has more or less been the same for some years now... I dont see much of a difference... Also, dont forget that except for three Tests in New Zealand, the other series in the past 12 months have all been at home... That has been a factor in our rise. Our real test, therefore, will be when we go to South Africa next November or so. Sachin (Tendulkar), Rahul Dravid and (V.V.S.) Laxman will all be a year older and, possibly, close to retirement.         
	Having been a successful captain, youre qualified to answer this: What goes into the making of a successful team?         
	The quality of players, thats most important... Look at our Test players... Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir at the top... Theyre followed by Rahul, Sachin, Laxman... (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni bats at No.7, after Yuvraj Singh! Its an incredible line-up... Dhoni may not be the best keeper to have played for India, but is excellent as a package... Then, the fast bowling unit is good... Harbhajan (Singh) has matured and is now leading the spinners... Clearly, weve got a very good (Test) team... Weve been fairly consistent from 2000-01, when we beat Australia in that epic series. Weve certainly grown and, at home, run teams over.         
	Anything else besides the quality of players?         
	Its mainly about the quality of players... I must add that (coach) Gary Kirsten has made a difference.         
	You worked with Kirsten for eight months. How did you find him?         
	Very good... Hes in the John Wright mould... Kirsten has allowed players to blossom... Given them the freedom to be themselves, the best example being Sehwag... Kirsten doesnt impose himself.         
	Just how important is the profile of a coach? Did Greg Chappell, for example, have problems because of his high profile?         
	Dont forget Kirsten has played more Tests (101 vis-a-vis 87) and scored more runs (179 in front) than Chappell... So, nobody should say Kirsten doesnt have a high profile... Its about handling the players and giving them the space to improve as cricketers and as human beings... To me, its about supporting the players.         
	Whats the No.1 challenge for India?         
	To be consistent.         
	Were you conscious of the rankings when you were an India cricketer?         
	Frankly, Ive never understood everything about the rankings... I mean, our ODI performances in 2002-03 were great, but we were still No.4 or so... I didnt understand that at all.         
	How do the Dhonis get better?         
	The boys are playing well... Theyll have to be consistent... But, yes, the ODI performances will have to be looked at carefully... We havent really been doing too well in the ODIs... We failed in the Champions Trophy and, then, lost to Australia at home... Even in this series, we just about won the first ODI, in Rajkot... For a while, it had seemed that even 414 couldnt be defended.         
	Talking of the Rajkot ODI, did you expect Sri Lanka to mount such a ferocious challenge?         
	No, but after they did, they shouldve won that match... Tillekaratne Dilshan was awesome, but I thought (Kumar) Sangakkara scored a brilliant 90.         
	Sri Lanka, it appears, cant handle the real pressure situations...         
	They need to rethink... Its a top-heavy line-up, with the lower middle-order very weak... Left to me, Id pick Sanath Jayasuriya... Even if he isnt to open, he could bat at No.3... Plus, he bowls and is still agile on the field. I dont know why hes not getting picked... In my view, in this team, only Dilshan is a better ODI player than Sanath.         
	Weve been seeing a lot of you and Sachin together over the past two days. Some words on the icon...         
	(Laughs) Sachins looking younger... Its after 13 months that Ive really got to spend some time with him...         
	Have you told Sachin that hes looking younger?         
	I have, yes.         
	When did you first meet Sachin?         
	Sachin was 13, then... We were together at an U-15 national camp in Indore and we were in the same dormitory... We do go back a long way and I value our association. (After a pause) I remember, even then, he used a heavy bat.         
	At Vaanis auction, on Tuesday, Harbhajan was an early bidder for a bat autographed by you. Did that come as a pleasant surprise?         
	Nothing about Harbhajan surprises me! Ive just heard hes bought property worth Rs 20 crore in Mumbai... Makes me happy... What I like most about him is that hes clear in the heart... Sehwags much the same.         
	Dhoni, Harbhajan, Sehwag, Yuvraj, Zaheer Khan... They either made their debut under you or their careers took off when you were the India captain... Given their standing today, you must be quite pleased?         
	Absolutely... I keep being told that I promoted Sehwag to the opening slot, but all the credit should go to him only... Hes been scoring, not me... All the players mentioned by you are match-winners and thats a big thing. They play to win.         
	What made you back them?         
	I went by my instincts... Saw their talent... During my five-and-a-half years as the captain, I was clear about one thing  neither picking anybody after just one performance, nor dropping anybody after one failure. Id select potential match-winners and they didnt let me down.         
	Strangely, Sehwags ODI record isnt all that hot...         
	Im sure hes pushing himself to get better... Ive been asking him to push himself in all forms of limited overs cricket.         
	Dhoni is seen as an aggressive captain, like you were. Whats your take?         
	I like the way Dhoni goes about his job... He, too, backs his players and a case in point is the emergence of Gambhir as such a quality batsman... I myself grew as a batsman when Sachin was the captain, because he had so much confidence in me... If the captain has so much faith, then it makes a difference.         
	Your thoughts on Thursdays ODI, at the Eden...         
	Its even... Weve lost two match-winners, Dhoni and Yuvraj, for different reasons, but weve still got enough firepower... There will be pressure on our middle-order, but I expect a strong response...         
	What about dew as a factor?         
	Is going to be an issue... Because of that, Id bowl first and chase when the spinners, in particular, would find it tough to grip the ball properly.         
	Bengal performed rather pathetically this season. Why?         
	Bengal cricket needs to take a hard look at itself... Among other things, we need an academy and we need a pool of 20-25 players who will have to be constantly monitored over a three-year period... We do have talented cricketers, but they just arent able to reach the next level... As you know, its the next level, the next step, which counts. We require a good coach, too, who can identify talent and help the players get better technically and mentally. Ive spoken to Mr (Jagmohan) Dalmiya, the CAB president, on this.         
	Finally, and honestly, are there times when you feel that you quit international cricket (in November 2008) a season too early?         
	No... It wasnt an impulsive decision... I made the announcement after much thought. That, despite my record, I wasnt being picked for the ODIs contributed to my decision... Id also been disappointed at being left out of the Rest of India team for the Irani Trophy... I dont regret having quit when I did.

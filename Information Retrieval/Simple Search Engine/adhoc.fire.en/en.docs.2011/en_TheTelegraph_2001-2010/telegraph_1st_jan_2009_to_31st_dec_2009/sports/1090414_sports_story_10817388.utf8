The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mind your own business, Harbhajan tells critics
                                                     Mind your own business, Harbhajan tells critics
                  Harbhajan Singh                     
	New Delhi: Harbhajan Singh insists he knows his business and loathes unwarranted advice, and for those who doubt his utility outside the subcontinent and mastery over the craft, well, they can take a walk is what the off-spinner has to tell them.         
	The feisty off-spinner revealed exactly how much respect, or rather the lack of it, he has for his critics, who questioned his efficacy outside the subcontinental dustbowls.         
	These people need to go through the records. I have taken wickets outside the subcontinent, in the West Indies and England. I guess some people need a reason to go after me, said Harbhajan, who finished as the leading wicket-taker from Indias recent tour of New Zealand.         
	But to be honest, I dont play for them. At the end of the day, I play for my country, which, for me, is much bigger than anything else. I feel great whenever I do well for the country, said the Punjab spinner.         
	And those who felt he often tended to bowl faster through air, Harbhajan said he knows his craft well and people better keep their opinions to themselves.         
	See, I know what it requires to be successful at the highest level. I have taken 330 wickets in Test matches and 200-plus in ODIs. That goes to show that I know what is required to win matches for the team, he said.         
	Those who are sitting in the comfort of their drawing rooms and watching the matches on television better mind their business. They have no business telling me what to do, Harbhajan said.         
	The 28 year-old spinner from Jalandhar believes his rich success in New Zealand has not only silenced the critics but also established himself as a senior member of the side, spearheading the spin department led by Anil Kumble till recently.         
	Winning the series in New Zealand was highly satisfying. I really enjoyed myself there. I got wickets in the Twenty20 matches and was the highest wicket-taker in both the Test and ODI series. I want to keep performing like this.         
	I had to take the responsibility (in Kumbles absence). When Anil Bhai was around, the workload used to get shared. Now Im not only the senior-most spinner but also the senior-most bowler in the side and naturally I have lot of responsibilities on my shoulders, he said.         
	He took 16 wickets in the three-match Test series and 5 scalps in the one-dayers.         
	Harbhajans batting was a revelation in New Zealand where the 77-Test veteran proved he was much more than just a mindless slogger.         
	His 60 in the first Test against New Zealand propped India in Wellington and Harbhajan said while the team can always expect some runs from his bat in crises, time was ripe for him to get his maiden Test century.         
	The team can definitely bank on me for those important runs. If you notice, all my innings so far have come at crucial times. All my teammates say you are good enough to score a Test hundred, and more than one hundred. They only ask me to be more focused and concentrate on shot selections. If I can improve on these Ill be getting big runs, Harbhajan said.         
	Many times, Sachin has told me that its time to get a hundred. Even when I got out after 60 (in Wellington) and came back to the dressing room, he said you should have got a hundred, Harbhajan said.

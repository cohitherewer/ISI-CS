The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Safina goes easy on herself
                                                   Safina goes easy on herself
                      
	Melbourne: For a change, Dinara Safina was nice to herself. At what seemed the most unusual of times.         
	A few matches ago at the Australian Open, Safina had berated her inconsistent play, saying she often seemed to be lackadaisical on court and lucky to have survived through the first week.         
	On Saturday, after losing 6-0, 6-3 in a 59-minute final to Serena Williams, the 22-year-old Russian was anything but upset.         
	Williams notched her 10th career Grand Slam, her fourth in Australia, and took the No. 1 ranking that Safina could have had with a win.         
	Although she earlier apologised to the crowd after the loss, referring to herself as a mere ballboy in the match, she took a different tack in her post-match news conference.         
	If I would have lost in the first round, of course I would sit here and I would start to think, she said. But I lost in the final. I made it all the way. There is much more positive than negative. I dont see any reason to panic.         
	That was a big change from her comments after her error-prone, three-set win over Alize Cornet of France in the third round.         
	I practice playing aggressive, hitting the balls  from 10 times 10 I hit exactly where I need to hit aggressive, she had said then. Then I come to the court and completely like my shadow is playing. Like Dinara is there, but not me.

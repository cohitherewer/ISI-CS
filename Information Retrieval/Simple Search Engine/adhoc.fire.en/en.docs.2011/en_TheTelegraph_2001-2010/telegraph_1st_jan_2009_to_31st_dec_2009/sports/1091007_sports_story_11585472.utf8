                                                     Ponting makes merry while McCullum picks up pieces
    - Australia captain dedicates champions trophy victory to team           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Brendon McCullum                                 
	Johannesburg: Captaincy and Brendon McCullum dont appear to be really cut out for each other.         
	Hed been a disaster as the Kolkata Knight Riders captain in this years IPL and, on Monday in neighbouring Centurion, fared no better while standing-in for Daniel Vettori in the Champions Trophy final.         
	Admittedly, McCullum didnt get much time to mentally prepare (It was in the bus, on reaching the ground, that I was told I would have to lead...), but vice-captains must be ready to take charge and, as important, make an impact.         
	McCullum failed with the bat, posting a blob, and also dropped Cameron White on 15, a lapse which proved very costly. As costly as Grant Elliott being dropped by Younis Khan, the Pakistan captain, in the semi-final.         
	Centurion (and MoM) Shane Watson and White, after all, scripted Australias retaining of the Champions Trophy after the first two wickets had fallen for a mere six runs.         
	Thanks to their 128-run partnership, Australia won by six wickets (206 for four), despite a superlative effort from the underrated Kyle Mills (three for 27) and a hostile opening burst from, well, Shane Bond.         
	Frankly, New Zealands 200 for nine, after winning the toss, wasnt enough by any standard. It was a good 60-65 short of a terms-dictating total, one reason for the deficit being Brett Lees fast and furious bowling.         
	Losing Daniel so late was a huge blow... We not only missed his bowling and batting, but inspirational presence... Were disappointed with the result, but proud of what we achieved (making the final)... Its a step forward, McCullum said, looking crushed, not a gainer in any way.         
	Ricky Ponting, who added another feather to his envy-attracting cap (two World Cups and two Champion Trophy wins as captain), praised Watson and White. I was a bit nervous... But to see these guys stand up and get us across the line was very satisfying...         
	Ponting didnt get big runs in the final, but his consistency in the earlier matches and quality leadership fetched him the Player of the Tournament award. And, yes, he didnt figure in a pushing/shoving episode at the presentation ceremony.         
	Indeed, the Sharad Pawar fiasco of 2006 wasnt repeated.         
	Fresh from a champagne bath and after collecting a cheque for $2 million, Ponting added: We pride ourselves on performances in big matches and in big tournaments... Its a reward for everybody associated with the team... Im ecstatic and well be having a big celebration.         
	Interacting briefly with The Telegraph, after the media conference, Ponting said: This win is for all the guys in the dressing room... Im dedicating it to them...         
	Watson, who began the Champions Trophy with two ducks, finished with unbeaten hundreds in the semi-final and final. Absolutely remarkable that.         
	One has to be in a good space mentally, not get carried away by the occasion, he pointed out, adding that doing well for the Rajasthan Royals in the IPLs first edition, last year, had been a turning point in his up-and-down career.         
	Were now seeing the real Shane Watson... Beginning with the Ashes, hes had a great few months, a pleased Ponting commented.         
	Significantly, both Ponting and McCullum gave the thumbs-up to 50-over cricket.         
	Weve been in South Africa for two weeks and the tournament is over... The earlier editions would drag on... This format has my endorsement... Theres certainly a place for both T20 and the 50-over game, but its Test cricket that I enjoy the most, Ponting observed.         
	McCullum, for his part, maintained: There werent too many nail-biting finishes, but the standard of cricket was good.         
	Its a point not many will contest.         
	Footnote: The ICC, for the first time, presented jackets to the winning team. While it was a nice add-on, most of the (white, not the Augusta-type green) jackets didnt fit the Australians. There definitely were awkward moments at the presentation ceremony.

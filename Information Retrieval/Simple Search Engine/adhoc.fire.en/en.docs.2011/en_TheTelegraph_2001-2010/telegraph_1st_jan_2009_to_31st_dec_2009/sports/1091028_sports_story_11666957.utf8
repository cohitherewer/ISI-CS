                                                     Joshimar is the saviour
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Action during Chirag United vs Mahindra United match at the Cooperage in Mumbai on Tuesday. (PTI)                             
	Mumbai: Brazilian Joshimars brace helped Chirag United escape with a 2-2 draw against Mahindra United Tuesday and hold on to the pole position on the I-League table.         
	Joshimars struck his double in the second half as the visitors twice came from behind with Mohammed Rafi leading Mahindras charge with a brace of his own in a thrilling fifth round encounter at the Cooperage.         
	With both teams missing key strikers  Muritala Ali for Mahindra and Edmilson for the visitors  the fans wouldnt have expected a goal fiesta but, in the end, there was no dearth of them.         
	Rafi put the hosts ahead in the 40th minute, heading in a floater from Paresh Shivalkar that caught Chirag custodian Somnath Khara out of position.         
	Chirag hit back when Mahindras defence suffered a lapse of concentration upon resumption.         
	Subhasish Chowdhury managed to block a powerful dipping drive from Denson Devadas, but Lalawmpuiya was at the right spot to pick up the rebound and play it to Josimar who tapped into an open goal in the 55th minute.         
	The equaliser brought back the sense of urgency and, the introduction of Uzbek Svetozar Mijin seemed to have revitalised the Mahindra camp as three minutes later came the second goal. It was a crisp interchange between Debabrata Roy and Ajayan followed by a cross from Mijin which Rafi slammed home with a right foot volley.         
	Rafi nearly had a hattrick three minutes later when his diving header, off a low cross from Sushant Mathew from the right, went in. But the goal was disallowed for offside.         
	Mahindra created a few more chances but failed to convert. That proved costly, as, in the 74th minute, Malasawmtluanga breached their defence and Josimar, for a man of his height, bent forward to meet the pass and draw his team level again.         
	Either team could have ended winner, though, as both missed quite a few sitters.         
	While Mahindra rue the failure to collect three points Chirag will be happy to have taken a point from an away match, especially with their main forward missing.         
	Chirag now have 11 points and Mahindra move to second in the standings with nine.

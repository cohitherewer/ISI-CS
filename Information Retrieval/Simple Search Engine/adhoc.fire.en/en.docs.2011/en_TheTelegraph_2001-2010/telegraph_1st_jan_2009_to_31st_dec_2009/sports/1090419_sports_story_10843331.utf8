                                                     Winning start for Mumbai
                  Mumbai Indians skipper Sachin Tendulkar en route to an unbeaten 59 in Cape Town on Saturday                     
	Cape Town: Sachin Tendulkar led from the front as Mumbai Indians launched their campaign in the second edition of the Indian Premier League with a stunning 19-run victory over last years runners-up Chennai Super Kings here Saturday.         
	Mumbai Indians first rattled up a competitive 166 for seven, riding Tendulkars masterly unbeaten 59 and a quickfire 35 by Abhishek Nayar, and then restricted Chennai Super Kings to 146 for seven in a tight game at the Newlands Stadium.         
	Tendulkar played a pivotal role by anchoring the innings with a crafty unbeaten 59 but it was young Abhishek Nayar who provided the impetus late in the innings with a 14-ball 35, which took Mumbai to a decent total on what appeared to be a rather spongy track.         
	Chennai never really recovered from a disastrous start, and although Matthew Hayden, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Andrew Flintoff got decent scores, it was not enough to reach the target. Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga was the pick of the Mumbai Indian bowlers with figures of 4-0-15-3.         
	Chennai lost opener Parthiv Patel off the second ball of the innings and found it difficult to maintain the required rate.           (AGENCIES)

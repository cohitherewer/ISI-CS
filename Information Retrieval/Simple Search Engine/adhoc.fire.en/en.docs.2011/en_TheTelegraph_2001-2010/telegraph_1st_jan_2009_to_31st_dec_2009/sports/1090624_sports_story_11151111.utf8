The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Never dreamt Id lead Bangladesh: Mortaza
                                                     Never dreamt Id lead Bangladesh: Mortaza
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mashrafe Mortaza during a media conference in Dhaka on Tuesday. (AFP)                           
	Calcutta: It was late on Monday that vice-captain Mashrafe Mortaza was informed that hed been promoted to lead Bangladesh.         
	Given the circumstances (a first-round exit in the World T20) of his elevation, the 25-year-old didnt celebrate.         
	Kono celebration kori ni... I hadnt been thinking of the captaincy... In fact, Id never even dreamt that Id one day get to lead Bangladesh, Mashrafe told The Telegraph on Tuesday.         
	Asked whether predecessor Mohammed Ashraful, who got the boot, had spoken to him after the change, Mashrafe replied: Yes... He did... I expect him to score big and make major contributions. We need to improve...         
	Did Ashraful assure him of extending a helping hand?         
	Mashrafe was quick to answer: That wasnt necessary... Its not a question of being behind me 100 per cent, its a question of being behind the country 100 per cent... Aami kono problem expect kori na.         
	But, surely, hed now be under more pressure?         
	Aapni theek bolchen... The pressure will definitely be more, but Im ready for additional responsibilities... Having been around for eight years (at the international level), I know the demands of todays cricket, Mashrafe responded.         
	Mashrafe, who is both the Bangladesh attacks spearhead and a competent late order batsman, said that he hadnt idolised any captain.         
	As Ive told you, I hadnt been thinking of the top job and, because of my orientation, havent had a role model or a favourite... Ill obviously be learning while Im leading Bangladesh, Mashrafe pointed out.         
	Mashrafe, who made his big-league debut in November 2001, has played 35 Tests and 103 ODIs. A handful of T20 Internationals too.         
	The new captains first test would be on the forthcoming tour of the West Indies. His task is well and truly cut out.         
	Incidentally, top-bracket all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan has been appointed Mashrafes deputy.

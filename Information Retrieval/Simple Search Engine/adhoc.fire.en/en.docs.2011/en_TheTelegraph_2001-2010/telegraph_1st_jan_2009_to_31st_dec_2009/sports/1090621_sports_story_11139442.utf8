The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Talks fail before ICC meeting
                                                   Talks fail before ICC meeting
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Lahore: Talks among the four co-hosts over Pakistans right to stage the 2011 World Cup matches broke down Saturday following which the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) threatened to resume their legal fight over the issue against the International Cricket Council (ICC).         
	The representatives from the four host nations will meet at Lords to discuss the issue of Pakistans hosting rights. Pakistan were originally scheduled to host 14 matches.         
	The Future Tours Programme post-2012 and recommendations by the cricket committee on the umpires decision referral system will also come up for discussion in the conference in London.         
	ICC president David Morgan will present a report on recent discussions with the PCB concerning the hosting of matches before the ICC Board on June 25. The annual conference will kick off with ICC chief executives committee meeting on Monday.         
	Morgan, vice-president Sharad Pawar and PCB chairman Ejaz Butt met on Friday to discuss the best manner in which a decision could be reached on Pakistans quota of matches. I am pleased we have made progress on this matter, Morgan said.         
	The PCB issued a statement that its chairman Ejaz Butt met representatives from India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in London to sort out the issue but the talks remained inconclusive.         
	We sought support of our fellow Asian co-hosts for matches to be played under the aegis of PCB in a safe neutral venue. Despite the fact that these discussions had been brokered by Morgan and Pawar, who is chairman of World Cup Central Organising Committee, no progress was made, PCB said in a statement. This will mean that organisational issues surrounding the 2011 World Cup remain unresolved and that the legal proceedings the PCB has brought against the ICC in Dubai and in Lahore will continue.         
	Sources said India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh had asked Pakistan to accept the hosting fees for the 14 matches, totalling $10.5 million, but to forget about hosting the matches at home or at neutral venues.

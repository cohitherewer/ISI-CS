	London: Manchester United easily reached the quarter finals of the FA Cup Sunday with a 4-1 victory at Derby.         
	United lost at Derby last month before overturning the deficit to reach the League Cup final, but never looked like stumbling again once Nani gave the Premier League leaders a 29th-minute lead.         
	Darron Gibson made it 2-0 a minute before halftime and Cristiano Ronaldo struck in the 48th for United, who were joined in the next round by Everton.         
	Everton made it to the quarter finals for the first time in seven years  and the first under long-serving manager David Moyes  with a 3-1 win over Aston Villa.         
	Derby, who beat United 1-0 at Pride Park in January before succumbing 4-2 in the second leg, did get a goal back through defender Miles Addison and nearly got a second with 12 minutes left, but goalkeeper Ben Foster kept out Gary Teales low shot.         
	United substitute Danny Welbeck made it 4-1 in the 81st.         
	Record 11-time FA Cup winners United almost took the lead in the 15th when Park Ji-sung lunged at the far post to get to a cross from Nani. The South Korea midfielder directed his shot on target but goalkeeper Stephen Bywater made an instinctive save to redirect the ball across goal and out for a corner.         
	Nani eventually got the opening goal with a run and shot at the edge of the area but Ronaldo had an effort ruled out because of offside in the 37th, although the linesman raised his flag so late that he was already celebrating with his teammates.         
	Gibson, who scored his first goal for United in last months third-round match at Southampton, made it 2-0 with an 18-metre shot and Ronaldo headed in from a corner for his 14th goal of the season.         
	Addisons header and Teales shot made things slightly uncomfortable for United, but Welbeck completed the win with a curling right-foot shot across the goalkeeper and inside the far post.

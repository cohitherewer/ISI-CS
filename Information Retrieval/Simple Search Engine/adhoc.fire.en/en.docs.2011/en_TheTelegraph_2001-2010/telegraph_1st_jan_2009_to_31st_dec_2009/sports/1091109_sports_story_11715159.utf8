	Wellington: New Zealand Cricket (NZC) officials hope to appoint a new national coach by the end of the year.         
	Former coach Andy Moles quit in October after falling out with senior players and the team are playing their current limited over series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) without a coach.         
	NZC chief executive Justin Vaughan said he expected a new coach would be named by the end of next month to allow him to prepare the team for their home series against Bangladesh, starting in February.         
	Theres no rush. Its important that we make the right appointment, Vaughan said in a statement on Sunday.         
	We have begun a scoping exercise to clearly define the exact requirements for the position. (REUTERS)

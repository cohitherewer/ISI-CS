	Calcutta: Bengal captain Habibur Rehman Mondal will miss the initial part of the pre-season starting from July 15.         
	The defender, who is admitted in the intensive care unit of a city hospital for extreme dehydration, will require another four to five weeks to regain full fitness.         
	His (Habiburs) is a case of extreme dehydration due to profuse sweating. This leads to muscle cramps and is very common among athletes, Dr Ranjan Srivastava, who is treating Habibur, said Friday.         
	Though there is nothing to worry about, Habibur still requires proper rest to regain full fitness. We had done a thorough medical check-up and there is nothing unusual. But we want to conduct other tests also We want to be sure that he is completely fine before we release him, Dr Srivastava added. It was learnt that the 25-year old defender has lost six kilograms.         
	Incidentally, Habibur has been out of action since the Santosh Trophy semi-final in Chennai. The Mohun Bagan player suffered severe cramps and had to be hospitalised after the match against Services, which his team won 2-0.         
	After my father passed away in May, I started suffering from severe depression. I tried to revive myself but nothing helped, Habibur said when The Telegraph paid him a visit in the ICU.         
	Ive suffered three cramps since then I dont know how I managed playing three matches in the Santosh Trophy But I want to get back to the field. Moving from one hospital to another is killing me. I want to get back into action, Habibur said.

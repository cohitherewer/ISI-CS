	Guadalajara: Michelle Wie raised both arms in the air, then put a hand over her mouth.         
	No need to say a thing  this celebration was a decade in the making. Immediately after tapping in Sunday to win her first LPGA Tour title, Wie pulled the ball from the 18th hole, looked up to the sky, let out a big sigh of relief, bounced up and down and pumped her right fist.         
	After all the near misses, after all the expectations, her long wait was over.         
	Its definitely off by my back, Wie said. I think that hopefully life will be a lot better, but I still have a lot of work to do.         
	Wie fulfilled her promise with a 3-under 69 for a two-stroke victory over Paula Creamer in the Lorena Ochoa Invitational. Wie finished off the victory in style, hitting a greenside bunker shot within a foot on the final hole to set up a birdie.         
	Wowww-w-w ...... never thought this would feel THIS great!!!! she posted on her Twitter account.         
	Solheim Cup teammates Morgan Pressel and Creamer showered Wie on the 18th green after the winning putt.         
	Just seeing them come out and pour beer all over me, it was a great feeling, Wie said. Ive always seen it on TV and Ive always wanted people to pour beer on me. It was as great as I thought it was.         
	Her parents, dad B.J. and mom Bo, were there, too, for an embrace.         
	I think its just so awesome, seeing them on the 18th green and hugging them, Wie said. You know, we have been through a lot as a family, and its just so great that they are here to share my highs and to keep me up from the lows, as well.         
	Wie earned $220,000 to push her season winnings just over $900,000. The win came in her 65th LPGA Tour event  she had finished second six times.         
	Wie won the 2003 USGA Womens Amateur Public Links, her only significant victory until Sunday.           (AP)

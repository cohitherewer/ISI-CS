The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arsenal set for first real test vs United
                                                   Arsenal set for first real test vs United
                      
	London: Arsenal will be tested for the first time in this seasons Premier League when they play at Manchester United on Saturday.         
	The Gunners have scored 10 goals in their first two matches but will be up against a defence that has helped secure a record-equalling three straight league titles and let in just one goal in three games so far.         
	But the biggest clash may be at the other end, where defender Thomas Vermaelen will be up against the in-form Wayne Rooney. Vermaelen has excelled in central defence alongside William Gallas since joining in July, and is looking forward to what may be his toughest match of the season.         
	I have not played against him (Rooney) yet, its my first time, Vermaelen said. Im not nervous. Every player looks forward to playing these types of games. I think if you play for Arsenal in the Premier League, every game is a hard game. In Holland, sometimes you had a game at home which was easy, but here you fight very hard.         
	Rooney has scored four goals in four matches for United, including two in the 5-0 win at Wigan. His move into the central attacking role he enjoys for England is key for United, following the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid, and he is likely to start at Old Trafford alongside Dimitar Berbatov  with Michael Owen on the bench despite his first club goal against Wigan.         
	I think they are a good team, Vermaelen said. They might have sold Cristiano Ronaldo but still they have very good players. When I saw them last year, they were playing as a team and thats very important.         
	Arsenal are on a high after beating Celtic 5-1 over two matches to reach the group stage of the Champions League, but the team will be missing captain Cesc Fabregas because of a hamstring problem, while United may be fresher after not playing in midweek.         
	United won last seasons title largely because of their superb record against the Premier Leagues lesser teams  taking 70 from a possible 72 points against the bottom 12 clubs.         
	Manager Alex Ferguson now wants his team to start improving against the bigger teams, specifically the so-called Big Four rivals, including Arsenal.         
	With 35 games left, you cant say that this game will be decisive, Ferguson said.         
	But what means a lot to us is that last season against the top teams, we dropped six points to Liverpool, five to Arsenal and two to Chelsea. We really need to address that and do better in these games. One opportunity comes along on Saturday and I hope we take it.         
	Victory could take either team top of the Premier League, although current leaders Tottenham are hosting Birmingham on Saturday and could stay there itself.         
	Spurs fielded what was essentially a reserve team in a League Cup match at Doncaster on Wednesday and still won 5-1, building on what is already their best start to a league season since they won the last of their league titles in 1960-61.         
	Manager Harry Redknapp is likely to revert to the line-up that won 2-1 at West Ham last weekend, although Peter Crouch and David Bentley impressed sufficiently to be competing with Robbie Keane and Aaron Lennon for a starting berth.         
	Chelsea are tied with Tottenham on a maximum nine points and hosts Burnley on Saturday, while Liverpool are at Bolton and desperate to avoid a third loss from four games. Defeats at Tottenham and at home to Aston Villa have left Liverpool ailing in mid-table with three points.         
	With Daniel Agger injured and Martin Skrtel still recovering from a blow to his jaw, Greece defender Sotiris Kyrgiakos could make his debut in central defence for the Reds.         
	I won one title with Panathinaikos and two in Scotland when I played with Rangers, Kyrgiakos said.         
	I hope that the experiences I had in Scotland will help me begin well at Liverpool. My time in Scotland will help because it is a similar style of football here.         
	Also Saturday, Sunderland are at Stoke and Hull are at Wolverhampton Wanderers. Fulham are at Aston Villa, Wigan are at Everton and unbeaten Manchester City are at Portsmouth on Sunday.                   (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Broad faces Butt ire
                                                   Broad faces Butt ire
                      
	Lahore: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ejaz Butt Thursday accused Match Referee Chris Broad of making fabricated, untrue and obnoxious remarks about the security arrangements for the Sri Lanka team and said they would lodge a complaint with the games world governing body.         
	What he (Broad) has said about the security is untrue and fabricated. Broad has made obnoxious comments, Butt said.         
	Broad had said that lack of adequate security made them feel like sitting ducks when the attack took place.         
	He also said that the security was not of presidential level, as had been promised by the PCB.         
	Butt also said the board would lodge a complaint with the International Cricket Council over Broads comments and added that two investigations were being carried out to determine whether security had been lax.         
	Butt also insisted that the security provided to the Sri Lankans was the same as that accorded them during the one-day series in January.         
	Broad himself had praised the security arrangements when he came for the one-day series, Butt said.         
	Butt wondered how the former English cricketer could make such a statement when seven policemen had been killed and ten injured trying to protect the players and match officials.         
	A police commando lay on Broad to protect him and suffered injuries.         
	I dont want to use the language I would like to use for him. Even in the past Broad had sent back a security sent to the airport to receive him and then complained to the ICC that security was not provided to him, he claimed.         
	I dont want to comment if there were any problems with the security. It would be premature. But this is the responsibility of the government and police authorities and if investigations show that the standard operating procedure for the visitors was not followed, we will point fingers at the people responsible, said Butt.         
	The PCB chairman said the board had played its role in co-ordinating with the authorities and providing all logistical support to the visiting team and match officials.

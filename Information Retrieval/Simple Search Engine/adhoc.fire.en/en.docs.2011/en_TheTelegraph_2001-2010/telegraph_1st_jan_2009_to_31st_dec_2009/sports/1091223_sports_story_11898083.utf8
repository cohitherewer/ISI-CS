The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Glad I was sent off: Zidane
                                                                                                                       7                                        Glad I was sent off: Zidane
                  Zinedine Zidane                     
	Paris: Former French midfielder Zinedine Zidane is glad he was sent off for his head-butt in the 2006 World Cup final because he has not had to live with regret over escaping punishment.         
	Zidane received a red card for head-butting Italy defender Marco Materazzi in the 2006 final, the last match of his career, which Italy won 5-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw.         
	It (the sending off) was a very good thing, the former Real Madrid and Juventus playmaker told a French football magazine, in an interview released on Tuesday.         
	Its good that (Italian keeper Gianluigi) Buffon signalled what I had done to the referee because it was not pretty. I dont know how I could have lived with it had France become world champions and I had stayed on the pitch.         
	Zidane, who had helped France lift the World Cup in 1998, thought there had been an overreaction to Thierry Henrys handball that led to France beating Ireland, in November, and securing a 2010 World Cup place.         
	Many people outside football got involved, people who love you when you lift trophies and let you down when things go wrong. Im certain Henry is not proud of his gesture, Zidane remarked.         
	The France and Barcelona striker has come in for a lot of criticism following what has been variously referred to in the media as the Hand of Gaul and the Hand of Frog.         
	Henry has apologised time and again for the handball and even said that he felt a rematch would be the best solution to the row.         
	In a post-match interview, Henry had said: I know what it is you want me to say and I am not going to lie  there was hand.         
	The ball hit my hand and I continued to play. The referee didnt blow his whistle and there was a goal. Obviously, I would have preferred that things panned out differently but I am not the official. I do not think we have stolen qualification.           (REUTERS)

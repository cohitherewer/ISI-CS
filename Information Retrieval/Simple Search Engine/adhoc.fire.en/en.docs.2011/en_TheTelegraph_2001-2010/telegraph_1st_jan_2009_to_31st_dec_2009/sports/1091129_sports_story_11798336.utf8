            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) may announce the I-League chief executive officers (CEO) name after an emergent executive committee meeting on Sunday. The Federation Cup final-round draw will also be announced.         
	The AIFF president Praful Patel, secretary Alberto Colaco, vice-presidents Subrata Dutta, AR Khaleel and Ankur Dutta, treasurer Hardev Jadeja will be attending the meeting.         
	Three candidates  AIFF competition director Anil Kamat, former Mahindra United coach Harish Rao, and Leisure Sports Managements (LSM) Sunando Dhar  had appeared for an interview in New Delhi on November 12.         
	According to sources, Dhar is likely be the first CEO of the I-League.         
	As of now he is ahead. But anything can happen. You never know, an AIFF source said on Saturday.         
	The AIFF will also take a decision on the five foreigners issue which has drawn a lot of flak from national coach Bob Houghton and captain Bhaichung Bhutia.         
	Other things on the agenda will be the I-League review and the senior national and Under-23 side camps in Goa.         
	Patel, who will be in town for a personal engagement, will also meet the East Bengal and Mohun Bagan club officials who were reluctant to release the players for long-drawn national camps.         
	When the controversy was raging, Patel had assured the clubs of a meeting to listen to their problems.         
	The committee will also discuss Indias opponents for an international friendly.         
	The AIFF had planned the national team to play against Iraq on December 12 at Delhis Ambedkar Stadium. But with Fifa banning Iraq recently, the AIFF is looking for another team.

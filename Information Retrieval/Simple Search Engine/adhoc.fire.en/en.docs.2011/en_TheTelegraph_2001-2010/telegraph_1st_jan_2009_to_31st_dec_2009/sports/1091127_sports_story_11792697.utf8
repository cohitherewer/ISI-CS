The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Day out for Akmals 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Day out for Akmals 
                      
	Dunedin: Umar Akmal announced his arrival in the Test arena with an impressive century on debut as he and his brother Kamran hauled Pakistan out of the mire on day three of the first Test against New Zealand.         
	Chasing the Black Caps first innings total of 429, Pakistan were left reeling on 85 for five at the University Oval after Chris Martin and Shane Bond had ripped through the top order.         
	But showing maturity beyond his 19 years, Umar Akmal sparked a stirring fightback as he brought up a maiden Test 50 in just 57 balls, including one sweeping six off Daniel Vettori, and continued to play his shots to reach three figures in 132 balls in the final session.         
	He showed no nerves whatsoever in the nineties, hitting Iain Brien for four then six, before his 16th boundary lifted him to 101 the very next ball.         
	Even his brothers dismissal in the next over for 82 did not distract the teenager and he continued to frustrate the New Zealand bowlers until he holed out to Peter Fulton at deep backward point off Bond when on 129.         
	His 160-ball innings included 21 boundaries and two sixes.         
	Meanwhile, the Pakistan Cricket Board confirmed that it was sending senior batsman Misbah-ul-Haq to New Zealand to strengthen the team for the ongoing Test series against the Black Caps.

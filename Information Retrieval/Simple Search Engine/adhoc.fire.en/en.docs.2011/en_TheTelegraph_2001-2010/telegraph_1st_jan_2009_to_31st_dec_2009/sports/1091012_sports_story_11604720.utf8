                                                   Bhowmick: Mixed emotions
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick had mixed emotions on his teams performance against JCT on Sunday. We missed chances, which was bad but at the same time the fact that we created those gives me immense joy, he said.         
	The main thing is to create chances Goals will come, he said.         
	Bhowmick said that he was surprised to see proven marksmen like Bhaichung Bhutia and Yusif Yakubu bungling in front of the goal. When the team goes through a bad patch everyone gets affected, he said in defence of their bungling strikers.         
	 These are early days. Not everything is lost. But I would have been happy if I had got full points from this match, he added.         
	JCT coach Sukhwinder Singh admitted that East Bengal were the better team on the day. But in the second half we did lift our game.

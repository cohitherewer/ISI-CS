The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Thought career was over: Clark 
                                                   Thought career was over: Clark 
                      
	Leeds: Australian paceman Stuart Clark has admitted he feared his Test career was dead and buried before his first innings comeback in the fourth Test of the ongoing Ashes series.         
	Clark (three for 18) started dredging up all of Englands bad memories of his pivotal role in Australias 5-0 thumping during the 2006-07 series with his nagging line and length at Headingley.         
	The soon-to-be 34-year-old said he had worried that his days in the baggy green were numbered because of the young trio of Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and Ben Hilfenhaus, according to an English daily.         
	Yeah, there were a few of them When youre injured there was a lot of speculation, would I play again or could I play again?         
	When the guys did so well in South Africa there was always a little bit of talk. I have to learn to deal with it, so do all the guys on the sidelines, Brett (Lee) is at the same position at the moment. When the guys bowl well theres nothing we can do about that, Clark said.         
	The New South Welshman slipped down the pecking order after the success of Siddle, Johnson and Hilfenhaus in South Africa earlier this year.         
	His last few efforts were hampered by his elbow problem that took the edge off his bowling.         
	However, he demonstrated in Leeds that he still had a penchant for taking English wickets, he now holds a record of 29 wickets at 15.89 against the old enemy. He wasnt sure why he had enjoyed such success against the Englishmen.         
	Maybe just right place at right time, he said.         
	Maybe its something I do with my bowling, its uncomfortable (for the batsmen).         
	Not any different to anyone else. Try to put as many balls in the right spot, a little bit of movement, if they nick them they get caught, if they miss them they get bowled, if they hit them in the middle they go for four, he said.

	Milan: Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Samuel Eto have the perfect opportunity on Wednesday to settle the argument over whether Inter Milan or Barcelona were the real winners from their swap deal.         
	In a fantastic twist of fates, the duo make their Champions League debuts for their new clubs against their former employers in a Group F clash.         
	Inter coach Jose Mourinho, a former Barca assistant who angered the Catalans with his antics in previous Champions League ties when Chelsea boss, has been his usual cheeky self.         
	Eto is the best attacker in the world. My players are always better. Last year Ibrahimovic was the best forward in the world, now I say Eto, he told reporters.         
	Ibrahimovic was the inspiration for Inters last three Italian titles and at times they depended too much on the tall Swede, although success was elusive in the Champions League.         
	With Eto immediately striking up a good partnership with fellow new signing Diego Milito, Mourinho thinks his side is now more complete and can finally make a mark in Europe.         
	A sold-out San Siro will want to see more proof of progress on Wednesday even if Ibrahimovics return will be the big focus.         
	From me he will receive a big hug, from the fans I dont know, Mourinho added. I will embrace him at the start of the match but for 90 minutes I dont even want to know his name.         
	At Anfield, midfielder Javier Mascherano is fit to return for Liverpools opener against Hungarians Debrecen. Mascherano missed Saturdays 4-0 Premier League rout of Burnley with a pelvic injury sustained on international duty.         
	He went to South America with a slight problem and played, Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez told reporters on Monday.         
	Afterwards he needed to check it out so we decided he should do it over there and miss our game at the weekend.         
	Meanwhile, Arsenal striker Eduardo da Silva has won his appeal against a two-match ban imposed by Uefa for diving in a Champions League qualifying game against Celtic.         
	The Brazilian-born Croatian international was initially banned after winning a controversial penalty against Celtic. Eduardo is now free to play in Arsenals first two Group H matches at Standard Liege on Wednesday and at home to Olympiakos Piraeus on September 29. (Reuters)

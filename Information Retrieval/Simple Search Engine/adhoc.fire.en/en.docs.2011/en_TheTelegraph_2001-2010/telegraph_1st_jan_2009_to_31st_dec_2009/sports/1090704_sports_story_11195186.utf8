                                                   CAB posts record profit
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) has managed a record profit of Rs 14.99 crore for the 2008-09 financial year. The amount is almost Rs 10 crore more than what the Prasun Mukherjee-led regime had managed in the last term.         
	This is a record profit for the CAB, joint secretary Biswarup Dey said after the CAB finance committee meeting on Friday. It was learnt that the amount would be spent for the development of cricket in the state.         
	Meanwhile, the CABs special committee has decided to ask the working committee to claim the uncalled for expenses of Rs 1.75 crore during the inaugural IPL from the erstwhile committee.

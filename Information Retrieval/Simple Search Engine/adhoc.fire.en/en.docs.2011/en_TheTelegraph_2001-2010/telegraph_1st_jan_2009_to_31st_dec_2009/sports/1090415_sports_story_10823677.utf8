The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ambedkar pitch a worry for depleted Bagan
                                                     Ambedkar pitch a worry for depleted Bagan
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Barreto during a practice session at the Ambedkar Stadium on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	New Delhi: The Ambedkar Stadium here has always been a happy hunting ground for Mohun Bagan. But the same pitch could prove to be the burial ground for the Calcutta clubs I-League title dream when they take on Mahindra United on Thursday.         
	For the record, the green and maroon brigade have won 18 titles here, including 16 Durand Cup victories.         
	Bagans match against Mumbais Mahindra is their last match of the prestigious I-League  probably their most important match of the season too. But the pitch itself could prove to be a hurdle.         
	The ground is not the best venue to host such a crucial match. Its hard and uneven. Difficult to control the ball here, said Jose Ramirez Barreto, Mohun Bagans man for all seasons.         
	Delhi Soccer Association (DSA) officials are doing their bit to bring the turf back to shape but as the Brazilian pointed out, it still needs a lot of effort.         
	What upset Barreto most was that the result of the match would have a huge bearing in deciding the I-League title.         
	Its sad that while one team will be playing on a good ground in Goa, the other team has to fight for the title on this kind of a field. This is not the right approach, said the soft-spoken Brazilian.         
	While Barreto made no secret of his displeasure, Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa decided to put up a brave front. The odds are heavily stacked against the Calcutta club and no one knows it better than the Moroccan.         
	The weather is fine and the ground is lush green, Karim said with a wide grin. Once the joke was taken, he looked dead serious.         
	Things are not going to be easy for us, but we have come a long way. I feel we still enjoy the champions luck. For 20 minutes Churchill were the champions when they took the lead against Air India.         
	They faltered and we are still in the race. Who can guarantee that it wont be the same case in the end, asked the Mohun Bagan coach.         
	But then, Mohun Bagans biggest priority is to put it across Mahindra before they can really hope to see Churchill faltering against Mohammedan Sporting in Margao. And with some of the key players missing from the ranks, they have been left with a mountain to climb.         
	During training, Karim tried various combinations and said he was yet to finalise his starting eleven for Thursdays tie.         
	However, indications are that Anand Vasan will step into the boots of defender N.S. Manju and Malsawmtulunga will replace Rakesh Masih in the mid-field. One wont be surprised if Rahul Kumar takes the place left vacant by the absence of Marcos Pereira.

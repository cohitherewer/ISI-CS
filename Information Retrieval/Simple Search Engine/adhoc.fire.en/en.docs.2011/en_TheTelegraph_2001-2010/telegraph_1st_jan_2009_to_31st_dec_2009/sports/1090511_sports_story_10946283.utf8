The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Royals have the edge
                                                   Royals have the edge
                      
	Kimberley: Although both teams have met with reversals in the previous matches, Shane Warne the tactician will give the Rajasthan Royals the edge over Adam Gilchrists Deccan Chargers when the two sides meet in the Indian Premier League here Monday.         
	Warne had the last laugh in the previous encounter and Gilchrist would be eager to get even with the man with whom, as a wicketkeeper, he shared one of the most successful partnerships for Australia.         
	For the Chargers, Andrew Symonds has made a brilliant start after joining late. Gilchrist himself has been in fine nick and Herschelle Gibbs hasnt done too bad either. Add to that, Rohit Sharmas consistency and the Chargers line-up looks formidable. But the Royals batting is no less powerful with openers Naman Ojha and Graeme Smith in fine form.         
	In Yusuf Pathan, the Royals have the livewire who can change the course of a match. Warne, himself, is no novice with the bat. It is the bowling, perhaps, which gives the Royals the slight edge.         
	Pacer Amit Singh has wrought havoc whenever he has been given the ball. Left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja is also among the wickets and adding to the teams bowling strength is the captain-cum-coach Warne himself. In contrast, R.P. Singh has not been too consistent for the Chargers. (PTI)

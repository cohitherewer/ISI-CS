	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has asked its Sri Lankan counterpart to confirm the final itinerary for their forthcoming tour of Pakistan. This comes amid growing concern that the series is being delayed unnecessarily by Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) officials had first confirmed a tour of Pakistan from January 20 to play three Tests and five one-day Internationals but now they want a shortened tour of two Tests, three ODIs and a Twenty20 game from February 15.        
	Calcutta: Former Australian cricketer Glenn McGrath and Matthew Hayden have appealed to fans to support the McGrath Foundation by sporting a pink bandana and wearing pink for the third Australia-South Africa Test that begins in Sydney on Saturday.          
	New Delhi: India have to keep rival teams under constant pressure if they are to become the No.1 Test cricket playing nation, feels former captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi. Apparently disappointed with the way India drew the second Test against England at Mohali, Pataudi said the hosts should have gone for the kill rather than settling for an easy draw.        
	London: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) will sign a ground-breaking agreement later this month with provision for an Ashes-like series, media reports claimed here Thursday.        
	Melbourne: Mike Procter, who was the Match Referee in the infamous Sydney Test marred by the racism row involving Harbhajan Singh and Andrew Symonds, feels the Indian off-spinner must have regretted what happened last January.          
	London: Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic has succeeded in his bid to stage an ATP tournament in his hometown of Belgrade from 2009. Belgrade earned the right to host a claycourt tournament from May 4-10 next season.

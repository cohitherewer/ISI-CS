The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harendra blames   defensive game
                                                   Harendra blames   defensive game
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: The Indian hockey teams coach-in-charge Harendra Singh said on Monday that to go on the defensive against China in the recently-concluded Asia Cup was a big mistake.         
	Harendra, who returned with the team from Malaysia, where India finished a poor fifth, felt taking a defensive approach was Indias undoing in the tournament.         
	In modern hockey, a team should never relax, even after taking a big lead, Harendra said. We paid the price of trying to sit on a 2-0 lead against China. That was a mistake.         
	However, Harendra said the defeat in the Asia Cup was only a temporary setback. Our boys did a good job and I am sure they will improve with time. All we need to do is to be a little more patient, Harendra said.         
	The coach-in-charge, who will now assist Spanish coach Jose Brasa for future assignments, firmly denied that his team played poor hockey in the Asia Cup.         
	That was not the case, he said. We scored the most number of goals and yet failed to reach the semi-finals. The team that took the third place did not even win a single match.

                                                   Leander routine for cricketers
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: In the coming Ranji Trophy season the Bengal cricketers will follow the same fitness programme as Leander Paes.         
	Dr Vece Paes, the man entrusted with the job of making Bengals Ranji side and the juniors fitter, told reporters that he will conduct the same Peak Performance Programme for Bengal cricketers that Leander has been following since 1984.         
	Leander has been following this programme for 15 years now and almost all the top physios or sports medics put their clients through at least a part of this programme, Dr Paes said Tuesday evening at the Eden.         
	However, Dr Paes was not sure about the amount of time he would be able to spend with the Bengal team. I had a cursory look at Bengals assignments for the next season. Ill check and after that I can say how much time I can give the team or the academy, he said.         
	Asked about his plans about the senior team, Dr Paes said: I have prepared a presentation. Ill show it to (Jagmohan) Dalmiya and then Ill send it to (chief coach) Roger Binny. After that, well decide what and how much we want to do.         
	Dr Paes also said that his association with Indias Davis Cup team should not be a problem as Indias next tie is in September.

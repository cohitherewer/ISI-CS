The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rebecca vows to bounce back
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rebecca vows to bounce back
                      
	London: Britains Olympic champion swimming gold medallist Rebecca Adlington says she is determined to raise her game in 2010 after a slump in form following her Beijing triumphs.         
	Beijing may turn out to be the best week of my entire life but Id hate to think that everything went downhill from the age of 19, she told a newspaper. I dont want to be a one-hit wonder. Im always going to remember 2009. Ill always recall how it felt not to perform.         
	Ill never forget those feelings. And Im never going to let it happen again, she added.         
	Adlington won the 400 and 800 metre freestyle gold in Beijing in 2008 but came only third in the 400 and fourth in the 800 at the World Championships in Rome in July.         
	The Briton had earlier spoken out against the latest, now-banned, bodysuits as technological doping and had refused to wear them.         
	Well never know what difference the swimsuits made in Rome, she said on Sunday. What I do know is that I swam the 800 metres three seconds slower than in the previous year.         
	Its taken me time to work out why, but September to December is a crucial time because thats when all the engine work is done in the pool.         
	I spent a fair bit of that time last year enjoying the post-Beijing euphoria, and I wouldnt swap it for anything, said Adlington.         
	That might have been my last Olympics so it would have been a dreadful shame not to enjoy it all. (Reuters)

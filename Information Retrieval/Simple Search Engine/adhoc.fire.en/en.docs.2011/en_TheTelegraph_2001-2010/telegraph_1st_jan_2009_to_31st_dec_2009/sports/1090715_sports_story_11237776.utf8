                                                     PCB gives meeting a miss
    - Committee confirms India to host 29 matches including final             A STAFF REPORTER    
	Calcutta: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Tuesday skipped the Central Organising Committee (COC) meeting for the International Cricket Council (ICC) World Cup 2011 due to the ongoing legal tussle with the apex body regarding the shifting of matches from the strife-torn country.         
	The meeting, under the chairmanship of the ICC vice-president Sharad Pawar, was held in Mumbai and was attended by representatives of the other host nations  India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.         
	The ICC board decided in April that the 14 matches, allocated to Pakistan, could not take place in the country because of the uncertainty surrounding the security situation. It was also decided that the tournament secretariat should not be located in Lahore, as originally planned.         
	Tuesdays meeting was convened in order to make recommendations to the ICC board as to where the matches originally allocated to Pakistan should be staged and where the tournament secretariat should be based.         
	The committee confirmed that the 14 matches, originally scheduled to take place in Pakistan, will be redistributed with eight going to India, four to Sri Lanka and two to Bangladesh. Out of the 49 matches in the tournament, India will host 29 matches with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh hosting 12 and eight matches respectively.         
	A total of 13 venues will be used for the tournament with eight of those in India, three in Sri Lanka and two in Bangladesh.         
	The ICC said in a statement that a schedule would be announced in due course and recommendations from Tuesday would be communicated to its board.         
	The committee also confirmed all the decisions taken at the previous meeting in April, including shifting of the event secretariat from Lahore to Mumbai, holding the final in India, the semi-finals in India and Sri Lanka, and distributing the quarter finals among the three co-hosts with two of those matches going to Bangladesh.         
	Scheduling for the quarter and semi-finals will attempt to ensure that the host country will play at home should it qualify, the ICC said. All venues for matches will be confirmed and announced in due course.         
	Ratnakar Shetty, the chief administrative officer of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) was confirmed as the events tournament director.         
	We had a good, productive meeting. There was a recognition that there is much hard work to be done but we are confident we are now well on the way, with operational plans in place to become effective from the start of August, Shetty said.         
	Moving forward, the COC will meet on a regular basis with everyone committed to a successful event, something we are confident we can achieve.         
	The following are the other recommendations made by the COC:         
	It was agreed that all three countries that host matches should constitute local organising committees. It was further agreed that the members of these committees should be nominated by the relevant countries by the end of July 2009.         
	It was agreed that the PCB would be asked to confirm three representatives to sit on the COC.         
	The COC will be chaired by Sharad Pawar with Mahbubul Anam of Bangladesh as its convenor and Sujeewa Rajapakse as its treasurer.         
	The PCB would also be asked to nominate a member to sit on the committee in charge of operational planning. The other members of that committee will be Anam (convenor, Bangladesh Cricket Board), N. Srinivasan (BCCI), Nishanta Ranatunga (Sri Lanka Cricket), Shetty (tournament director), Rajapakse (treasurer) and M.P. Pandove (honorary secretary, BCCI)         
	Inderjit Singh Bindra, the ICC principal advisor, will work closely with the COC, bringing his experience to the administration of the tournament.         
	A security directorate will be formed under the chairmanship of the BCCI president Shashank Manohar. It will include representatives of all hosts and the ICC in an attempt to manage the issue both before and during the tournament. It will meet regularly and put together a security plan for consideration by the ICC board by the end of September.         
	A committee under the chairmanship of N. Srinivasan will take charge of the issues of inspecting venues and pitches. Preliminary inspections are likely to take place in October.

	Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar, the Mumbai Indians captain and his Deccan Chargers counterpart Adam Gilchrist were fined $20,000 each for slow over rate in their Indian Premier League (IPL) match at Kingsmead, Durban on Saturday. The Chargers defeated the Mumbai side by 12 runs in the match.    
	A decision in this regard was taken by Match Referee Devdas Govindjee from South Africa, the IPL authorities said in a statement. The Delhi DareDevils were also penalised for a similar offence in their match against Chennai Super Kings at the same venue, on Thursday.        
	Calcutta: Pakistan captain Younis Khan was fined 50 percent of his match fee after his side was found guilty of slow over rate in their match against Australia on Friday. Match Referee Jeff Crowe charged Younis with a Level 2.11 ICC Code of Conduct breach. The other players were each fined five per cent of their match fees for every over they failed to bowl in the time allowed.          
	Abu Dhabi: Pakistan opener Nasir Jamshed will return home after pulling his hamstring in the first match of the one-day series against Australia, team manager Yawar Saeed said on Sunday. The 19-year-old left-handed batsman suffered the injury while fielding, and batted with a runner during Pakistans four-wicket win in Wednesdays match.        
	Calcutta: Pakistan spinner Saeed Ajmal has been reported for a suspected illegal action following the second one-day International against Australia in Dubai on Friday, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said. An ICC statement said umpires Asad Rauf and Billy Bowden, as well as the third and fourth umpires Zameer Haider and Nadeem Ghouri, had reported concerns over the 31-year-olds action and decided it should be scrutinised further.        
	Wellington: New Zealand Cricket chief executive Justin Vaughan has described the great allrounder Sir Richard Hadlees decision to accept a role with an unsanctioned American cricket league as regrettable. Hadlee confirmed Sunday that he will act as an executive consultant to the American Premier League, a six-team Twenty20 competition, likely to be staged for the first time in New York in October.           
	Islamabad: Former Pakistan captain Javed Miandad called for the 2011 World Cup to be moved from Asia, on Sunday, citing Australias decision to boycott a Davis Cup tennis series in India because of security concerns. If Pakistan is not safe, what will you say about India where Australia refused to go and play Davis Cup, which is not a big team sport like cricket, said Miandad. It will be better if the ICC awards the 2011 World Cup to some other non-Asian country, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Missing our Pak players: John
                                                     Missing our Pak players: John
            A Staff Reporter            John Buchanan                           
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders coach John Buchanan feels the unavailability of the franchises Pakistan players has had an impact on his sides fortunes in the Indian Premier League season two.         
	Buchanan, who has been criticised severely for the Knight Riders dismal show, said the Brendon McCullum-led team is also finding it difficult to strike the right balance in the playing eleven.         
	Asked whether he missed the Pakistan players, Buchanan said: I suppose the answer is yes. Umar Gul, particularly because Shoaib Akhtar played only one game last season.         
	Again, as we are talking about the whole series, its always difficult to find all the players that you want in the side at one time.         
	We have sat around, talked about Charl Langeveldt a number of times as well. It would always still be the same sort of question. Whats the best balance for your side, who can we actually pick to play and win the game, he was quoted as saying on the IPL website.         
	Buchanans controversial multiple captains theory ensured the Knight Riders stayed in the news for all the wrong reasons.         
	The Calcutta outfits worries were further compounded when they started losing match after match to put themselves out of semi-final reckoning.         
	The Kolkata Knight Riders have lost 10 out of the 12 matches they have played in the second edition of the IPL. They have confirmed a last-place finish for themselves.           (PTI)

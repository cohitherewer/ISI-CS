The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Monty Panesar wants to return to basics
                                                   Monty Panesar wants to return to basics
            THE TIMES, LONDON                      
	Monty Panesar has abandoned plans to broaden his repertoire for the Ashes series and is reverting to the bowling methods that brought him success early in his Test career.         
	After more than two years as Englands first-choice spinner, Panesar lost his place to Graeme Swann this year and has been criticised for the lack of variety in his bowling.         
	He has been experimenting with changes of pace and flight while playing for Northamptonshire this season, but has taken only six first-class wickets at the exorbitant cost of 86.66 runs each. The buzzword for Panesar now is reconnect, which signals a desire to return to his natural game, whatever its limitations.         
	My strength is that I have a natural ability to bowl a certain pace, to bowl lots of overs and get a lot of maidens, he said yesterday (Monday). Ive got to re-connect to that natural bowling style.         
	The focus will be firmly on the left-arm spinner when England play Warwickshire in the three-day Ashes warm-up match, starting at Edgbaston tomorrow (Wednesday). Of the 11 players selected, he is the only one whose place is uncertain for the first Test at Cardiff next week.         
	England may opt to play a fourth seam bowler, probably Ryan Sidebottom or Graham Onions, and even if they pick two spinners, Adil Rashid is breathing down Panesars neck.         
	The latters lack of form this season effectively makes the match against Warwickshire a personal trial.         
	I wanted to be taking lots of wickets while I was experimenting, but Ive recognised that I dont have the skill to do that at the moment, he said.         
	Over the last couple of weeks Ive just been trying to bowl my stock ball all the time. And this game will not be the right time for experimentation.

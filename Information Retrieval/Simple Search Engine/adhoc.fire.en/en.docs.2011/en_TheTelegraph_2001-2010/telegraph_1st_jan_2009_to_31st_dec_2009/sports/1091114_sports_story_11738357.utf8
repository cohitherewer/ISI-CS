The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kapil to part with   a further Rs 200
                                                                                                                                     Kapil to part with   a further Rs 200
    - No bet this time, but tendulkar will get richer           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Kapil Dev                                       
	Puri: It wasnt exactly a conventional bet, even though Kapil Dev calls it as such, but the bottomline is that he had to cough up the princely sum of Rs 200 when Sachin Tendulkar completed 10 years as an India cricketer.         
	That was on November 15, 1999.         
	Its like this... On his debut series (Pakistan, 1989-90), I told Sachin that Id give him Rs 200 if he could represent India for 10 years... That, indeed, was the bet... Sachin did and I happily gave him that amount... On Sunday, Ill again have to give Rs 200, for Sachin will be completing 20 years! Kapil said, laughing.         
	The where business, however, hadnt yet been settled.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph on Friday, Kapil added: If theres a worry, its that Sachin may play till 2019 and Ill have to part with a further Rs 200!         
	According to Kapil, such bets arent unhealthy.         
	Look, Bharath Reddy is a dear friend of mine, but when he said I wouldnt take 400 Test wickets, I opened a bottle of champagne when I did and called Bharath to say Id opened it on his behalf, Kapil recalled.         
	Kapil, by the way, got to 400 wickets (Mark Taylor being the victim) on the 1991-92 tour of Australia.         
	Eventually, Kapil finished on 434 wickets, a world record at that point in time (1994), in 131 Test appearances.

	Chandigarh: The runners-up finish in the Punjab Gold Cup has lifted the morale of the Indian hockey team which will now chase the number six spot from the current 11th in the world rankings by the end of this year, coach in-charge Harendra Singh said Monday.         
	After their performance in the Argentina Test series and the Punjab Cup, the confidence level is back and you will see results in upcoming tournaments as well, Harendra said.         
	He said the team was eyeing the Champions Challenge in Argentina in December which would take them to the number six spot. After that, breaking into top four would be the next target.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: There was a silver lining for the Indian womens cricket team on their tour of Australia late last year.         
	Although they were thrashed 0-5 in the one-day series, they won both their warm-up matches at the Bradman Oval in Bowral, near Sydney.         
	Embarking on their second visit Down Under in four months, this time for the World Cup, the 16-member side is hoping that the hometown of the greatest cricketer ever will once again prove to be lucky.         
	Each game is important, skipper Jhulan Goswami, looking fresh and stylish in the India blazer, said, while talking about the teams first group game against Pakistan on March 7, the opening day of the quadrennial event.         
	An India versus Pakistan game is a big thing and it is also important to start the tournament on a winning note. But we will be taking it step by step, the 25-year-old from Nadia said, on the eve of the teams departure to Australia.         
	Of the three games India played at the Bradman Oval in the October-November series, the first was washed out and the visitors won the remaining two by 48 and 82 runs respectively.         
	Jhulan picked up five wickets in those games and even starred with the bat in the last, striking a ferocious 31-ball 41 not out.         
	But Jhulans memories of Bowral are not restricted to the cricket pitch. The Bradman museum was fantastic, she recalls with a radiant smile.         
	Jhulans excitement was in keeping with the generally genial atmosphere in the lavish banquet hall of the Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) indoor cricket ground. For seniors like Anjum Chopra and Sulakshana Naik, it could be their last World Cup while for others like the 18-year-old Thirush Kamini, dubbed the baby, it will be their maiden appearance.         
	The teams fortune will depend much on the top order, which failed during the tour of Australia and England.

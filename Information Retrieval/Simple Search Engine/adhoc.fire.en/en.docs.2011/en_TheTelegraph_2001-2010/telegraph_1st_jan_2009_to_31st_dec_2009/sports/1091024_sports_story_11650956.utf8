                                                   Chance for India to be No.1 again
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India have a chance to regain the No. 1 position in the ICC ODI Championship table for the third time in as many months when they take on Australia in the seven-match series which begins in Vadodara on Sunday.         
	Trailing table-topper Australia by four rating points, Mahendra Singh Dhonis side will reach the top if they win the series but they can also drop below third placed South Africa if they lose 1-6 or 0-7, according to an ICC release Friday.         
	India had surged to the top after defeating New Zealand in their opening match of the tri-series in Colombo on August 11 and then again following South Africas loss to Sri Lanka in t2he ICC Champions Trophy opener in Centurion on September 22.         
	However, time spent at the top has been short for Dhonis side as they slipped back into second position after losing to Sri Lanka in Colombo on August 12, and then to Pakistan in Centurion on September 26. If India manage to beat Australia by 4-3 or better in this series, they will be guaranteed a place at the top  this time for a longer period.         
	In fact, India can go to top of the table as early as October 28, provided they win both the Vadodara and Nagpur matches. Australia, meanwhile, need to win the series to retain their No. 1 position.         
	In the individual rankings for batsmen, Dhoni leads Yuvraj Singh by a distance. Dhoni has been on the top since reclaiming the No. 1 position from West Indies captain Chris Gayle on January 31.

	Berne: Arsenals Eduardo da Silva, playing two days after his diving ban was lifted on appeal, celebrated his reprieve by scoring a late winner in a dramatic 3-2 Champions League win at Standard Liege on Wednesday.         
	The Brazilian-born Croatia striker netted from close range with nine minutes to go, three minutes after Thomas Vermaelen had levelled for the Londoners.         
	It meant Eduardo went from villain to hero because he was also at fault for Standards first goal as the Belgians went 2-0 up inside five minutes. Eduardo, sidelined for a year after breaking his leg in February 2008, had been due to sit out his teams Group H opener after being suspended for two games for deceiving the referee when he won a penalty in a qualifying tie against Celtic. The ban, which infuriated Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger and focused the spotlight on diving, was lifted by European soccers ruling body Uefa on Monday.         
	When you are a big club you cannot accept such a defeat so it was important to come back and win tonight, Wenger told reporters. We were caught cold by a Standard team that came out firing. It could happen to anyone but to come back and win showed a great team.         
	Holders Barcelona kicked off with a goalless draw at Inter Milan in the nights top match while Dynamo Kiev scored three times in the last 19 minutes as they came from behind to beat Russians Rubin Kazan 3-1.         
	Five-time European Cup winners Liverpool beat Hungarian outsiders Debrecen 1-0 at Anfield, Olympiakos Piraeus defeated AZ Alkmaar by the same score and Olympique Lyon overcame 10-man Fiorentina 1-0.         
	Liege, crushed 7-0 at home by Arsenal in a European Cup Winners Cup match in 1993, started as if they intended to avenge that result.         
	They went ahead after two minutes when Eduardo tried a back-heeled flick on the edge of the area but the ball fell to Eliaquim Mangala, who fired past goalkeeper Vito Mannone.         
	Milan Jovanovic then won and converted a fifth-minute penalty to double the lead for the group stage debutants. Nicklas Bendtner pulled one back for Arsenal on the stroke of half-time and that changed the complexion of the game.         
	Second-half Arsenal pressure ended with Belgian international Vermaelen scrambling the ball over the goal-line in the 78th minute following a Cesc Fabregas free kick.         
	Another lapse in Lieges concentration allowed Eduardo to turn and fire home Fabregass corner three minutes later.         
	Inter and Barcelona fought out a scrappy 0-0 draw with Samuel Eto, who left the Catalans for Milan in the close season, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who moved in the opposite direction, failing to manage a shot on target.         
	Lionel Messi showed some classy touches in the Group F game although the Argentine scooped an easy chance over the bar following Thierry Henrys cross-shot in the second half.         
	It is never easy playing against Italian teams but Im very proud we tried to win the game. We lacked a bit of precision, said Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola.         
	Liverpool struggled past unsung Debrecen in Group E after Dirk Kuyt scored in first-half stoppage time, sliding in the rebound after keeper Vukasin Poleksic had stopped a shot by Fernando Torres.

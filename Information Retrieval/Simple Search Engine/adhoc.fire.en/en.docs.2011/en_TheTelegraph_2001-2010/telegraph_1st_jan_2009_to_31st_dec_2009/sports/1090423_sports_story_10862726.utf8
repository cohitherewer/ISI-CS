            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has pledged support to Pakistan cricket which is facing international isolation in the wake of security concerns.         
	ICC president David Morgan and chief executive Haroon Lorgat on Tuesday met with PCB officials, led by chairman Ejaz Butt, as part of their ongoing process of information sharing with members.         
	It (meeting) gave us the opportunity to reiterate the commitment of the ICC and its members to the cause of Pakistan cricket at a time when it is facing some immense difficulties that are beyond its control, Morgan said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Batting order a worry for Yousuf amp; Co. 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Batting order a worry for Yousuf amp; Co. 
                      
	Karachi: With none of the senior players keen on batting at the No. 3 slot, the Pakistan camp is in a quandary over who to send in the crucial position during the second Test against New Zealand starting in Wellington from Thursday.         
	According to sources in the team, even Misbah-ul-Haq, who has been rushed to bolster the batting is also not keen to play at that particular position.         
	Who will bat at No. 3 has become a big talking point in the team meetings. As of now Faisal Iqbal has been asked to play at this position but even though he is not keen to play at number three, one source said.         
	The No. 3 position has been left vacant after Younis Khan pulled out of the tour. Younis, who was replaced as captain by Mohammad Yousuf, has been playing at the No. 3 position in Test matches for the last few years with considerable success and scored a triple hundred in Karachi this year against Sri Lanka.         
	The problem has arisen because neither Yousuf himself or Shoaib Malik are willing to volunteer to play at number three and now even Misbah and Faisal are uncertain about taking up this responsibility, the source said. Pakistan tried young Fawad Alam at this position in the first Test in Dunedin but he failed and the team also lost the match.

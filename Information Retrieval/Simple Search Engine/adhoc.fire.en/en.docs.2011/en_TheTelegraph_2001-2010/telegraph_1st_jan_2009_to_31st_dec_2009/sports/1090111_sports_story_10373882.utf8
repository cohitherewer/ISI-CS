                                                   Ronchi for Haddin in Twenty20 side
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Luke Ronchi has replaced Brad Haddin in Australias team for the two Twenty20 International matches against South Africa at the MCG and Gabba, Cricket Australia announced Saturday.         
	The National Selection Panel (NSP) said Haddins workload was being managed following his involvement in Australias tour of India and Test series against New Zealand and South Africa.         
	Given the high intensity of Twenty20 cricket and the upcoming schedule of one-day international matches, it was decided that this was an appropriate time to manage Brads workload with his and the Australian teams long-term interests in mind, said NSP chairman Andrew Hilditch said in a statement.         
	It now provides a deserved opportunity for Luke Ronchi to come back into the Australian squad after he impressed in the West Indies last year, he said.         
	Hilditch said that as per the CA policy Haddin was assessed Friday.         
	Despite being initially selected in the squad, we wanted to assess Brad once he had arrived in Melbourne, he said.

                                                     Struggling Reds host Lyon
    - Fernando torres ruled out of todays tie rubin visit nou camp                   Liverpool players take part in a training session on Monday, the eve of their Champions League match against Lyon. (AFP)                           
	Milan: After three consecutive defeats Liverpools season is unraveling before their eyes and only a convincing Champions League win at home to Olympique Lyon on Tuesday looks like lifting the gloom.         
	But the Merseysiders have to do it without the talismanic Fernando Torres. Liverpool will be without the Spanish international striker for Tuesdays clash but midfielder Steven Gerrard is expected to be fit, manager Rafael Benitez said Monday.         
	Torres is still not ready. Hopefully he will be for the weekend, but not for this game, Benitez told reporters ahead of the Group E match.         
	Torres and Gerrard both missed Saturdays 0-1 league defeat at Sunderland, the clubs third consecutive loss, a run that included a 0-2 defeat at Fiorentina in the Champions League.         
	Gerrard, who like Torres picked up a groin injury while on international duty last week, trained with the Liverpool squad on Monday.         
	Steven is fit. He has been training so hopefully he will be available tomorrow, Benitez said. It is important as we have had some problems with injuries since the start of the season, so having Gerrard fit is a big boost for us.         
	Liverpool will recall Javier Mascherano to their midfield after he started on the bench at Sunderland following his late return from international duty with Argentina.         
	Much like Liverpool, AC Milan will be given a stark reminder of their current plight when they come face to face with former talisman Kaka in Wednesdays Champions League game at Real Madrid.         
	The clash between nine-time winners Real and seven-time champions Milan is a highlight of the third set of group games in which holders Barcelona are hosting Russias Rubin Kazan.         
	Milan know exactly how Liverpools Benitez is feeling, having lurched from one setback to another both on and off the field since angering fans by selling Brazils Kaka to Real in June.         
	The 1-0 home defeat by FC Zurich in their last Group C game was one of a string of bad results and despite Sundays 2-1 win over AS Roma, rookie coach Leonardo remains under pressure. After Kakas sale its normal that there is a moment of adaptation, but its not an excuse, Leonardo told reporters.         
	Kaka has said he will not celebrate if he scores against his former side, who won the 2007 trophy thanks in part to the playmakers inspirational displays.         
	The Brazilian will be even more centre stage because Cristiano Ronaldo is still out for Real with an ankle injury, although he was not missed in Saturdays 4-2 win over Valladolid.         
	Zurich also entertain pointless Marseille on Wednesday.         
	Fiorentina head to Hungarys Debrecen buoyed by Saturdays battling 1-1 Serie A draw at Juventus.         
	Ciro Ferraras Juve have not won in five games in all competitions but will expect to break the sequence in Wednesdays Group A match with Maccabi Haifa in Turin. Bayern Munich and Girondins Bordeaux meet in France.         
	Also on Wednesday, 2008 winners Manchester United travel to CSKA Moscow with striker Wayne Rooney doubtful while VfL Wolfsburg host Besiktas in the other Group B game.         
	Striker Didier Drogba is still suspended for leaders Chelsea when they welcome Atletico Madrid in Group D where Porto meet APOEL Nicosia at home.         
	Barcelona drew 0-0 at Valencia on Saturday to drop points domestically for the first time this term and will be without the injured Thierry Henry for Tuesdays visit of Rubin, who troubled Inter Milan last time out in their 1-1 Group F draw.         
	Inter, though, are back on form for the home game with Dynamo Kiev after a 5-0 demolition of Genoa on Saturday.         
	Samuel Eto hopes to be back from injury to replace the suspended Mario Balotelli at the San Siro, where Dynamos former Milan forward Andriy Shevchenko will be making a return.         
	Groups G and H also have matches on Tuesday with Sevilla and Arsenal facing tricky trips to VfB Stuttgart and AZ Alkmaar.           (REUTERS)

                                                   Fisichellas Ferrari wish
                      
	Spa-Francorchamps: Force Indias Giancarlo Fisichella rated his chances of staying in Formula One next season as 50-50 on Thursday and said he would love to race for Ferrari this year should the opportunity arise.         
	Fellow Italian Luca Badoer replaced injured Brazilian Felipe Massa in Valencia last weekend but qualified last and finished a disappointing 17th.         
	There is quite a lot of speculation on that and a lot of rumour and I have seen my name everywhere on the top of the list. But Ferrari didnt call me, so for me its nothing, Fisichella told reporters at Spa. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Promise of result in Mumbai
                                                                                                                       7                                      Promise of result in Mumbai
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The pitch at the Cricket Club of India (CCI)s historic Brabourne stadium, which will host a Test match after a gap of 36 years, promises a result when India take on Sri Lanka in the third and final Test, that starts December 2, of the ongoing Jaypee Cup.         
	The Brabourne wicket is unlikely to witness the kind of batting marathons that the Motera and the Green Park tracks enabled, although the second Test saw India record their 100th Test win.         
	The CCI has always been a true Test pitch, good to bat and with turn from the third-fourth day onwards, former player and the club cricket secretary Milind Rege, also in-charge of the ground, said Friday.         
	It would be difficult for me to say how I expect the pitch to behave. That would be entirely up to the two teams. But the pitch would be similar to the one prepared for the Duleep Trophy match last year (2008-09 season).         
	In that match, West Zone beat East by eight wickets. The highest total of the match was 282 by West in the first innings and, for both sides, the seamers played a key role.         
	However, a month prior to that match, in the last week of December, Saurashtra had successfully chased 325 on the fourth and final day against Karnataka in a Ranji Trophy quarter final.         
	Rege said that the mild sun in December meant the track would retain some moisture on all five days. I am not an expert. I have left the job of preparing the pitch to the curator (Prakash Khadav). All that I have told him is that I want a good Test pitch, he said.         
	The last Test at Brabourne was in 1972-73 when India and England played out a draw. Farokh Engineer and Gundappa Viswanath scored centuries for India while Keith Fletcher and Tony Greig registered hundreds for the visitors.         
	But the most memorable, or controversial, of the 17 Tests the venue has hosted was the fifth Test against the West Indies in 1948-49 when the umpires removed the bails on the final day with one-and-a-half minutes still remaining and India six runs away from victory.         
	In all, India have won four Tests and lost two at Brabourne.         
	Meanwhile, the club plans to unveil a book  75 years of CCI  during the upcoming Test, which will also be the first competitive game played at the venue since the demise of former Board president Raj Singh Dungarpur on September 12.         
	The opportunity to host this Test has come to us because the Wankhede is being renovated. It was Rajbhais dream that Test cricket should return to CCI (before he passed away). I am sure he will be happy up there, Rege said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lal: Dont endorse   the idea
                                                     Lal: Dont endorse   the idea
            A STAFF REPORTER    
	Calcutta: The citys cricket fraternity is sceptical about John Buchanans move to rotate the Kolkata Knight Riders captaincy during the second edition of the Indian Premier League. The Telegraph spoke to a few.               
	The following are excerpts (in alphabetical order)         
	Sambaran Banerjee: This is the most unscientific concept Ive ever heard of and it will only complicate matters. We should remember this is not football. In cricket, 90 per cent of the decisions have to be taken on the field depending on the changing situations of the game. To me it is totally unclear.         
	Deep Dasgupta: I dont subscribe to this idea. My simple question is, as a player who do I approach in times of need? If four people are running the show, what does one make out of it! As the saying goes, too many cooks spoil the broth! Why complicate things unnecessarily? T20 is, after all, a game of cricket! It is no rocket science!         
	Devang Gandhi: I dont agree with Buchanan. Firstly, this is not a stage where you can try out certain new things. Secondly, who does the players look up to in times of need? Generally, theres one leader and the players follow him. But here you will have four captains It will only leave the players confused. Basically, Buchanan is trying to be the boss Like we have in football. In a team sport like cricket, such ideas dont work. When you have somebody like Sourav, who is a proven leader, why try something like this? This will never be successful and will only lead to division in the side even before the season has started. Look at Shane Warne! He is a players captain. He inspired Rajasthan Royals to win the inaugural edition of the IPL. Compare it with Knight Riders! Who will the players look up to this time? A coach should always remain in the background. Gary Kirsten is a perfect example. But Buchanan is one wholl always jostle to remain in the limelight.         
	Arun Lal: I dont know... I am sceptical about the move and wouldnt like to endorse it. I will wait and see as to how it works out. I think they are trying to develop a concept where, like in football, the managers role is paramount. Twenty20 is too quick a game and Im interested in knowing how it works!         
	Ashok Malhotra: John is only trying to find out ways to run the team from the sidelines. He is trying to be an Alex Ferguson. I dont know the agenda but the bottomline is to remove Sourav as the captain. He (John) is lucky that the IPL is moving out of the city, otherwise The season is yet to start but John is already on the wrong foot. He is creating doubts in the minds of the fans. This will have an adverse effect on the Knight Riders performance. The idea to have three or four captains is silly. What if these captains differ in their ideas? I have never heard of this kind of strategy. One should learn that this is not football This is cricket. Though Twenty20 is a different ballgame altogether, I dont think this will ever help.

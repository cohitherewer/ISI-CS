                                                   Cant repeat mistakes: Yuvi
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Wellington: Yuvraj Singh on Thursday refused to read much into Indias seven-wicket defeat in the tour opener but admitted his side could not afford to repeat the mistakes in the second Twenty20 International against New Zealand.         
	The southpaw said playing too many shots early in the innings was the reason behind Indias downfall in the first game in Christchurch.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	The feeling in the Indian team         
	The feeling is good, it was just one bad game. We made some mistakes, its the start of the new tour, and we have to understand a few things, the conditions and the wickets. So hopefully well make fewer errors in the next game.         
	The boundaries         
	They are a bit short. In India also you get a few grounds which have short boundaries. You have to keep in mind that you have still got to play good cricket shots to clear those ropes.         
	On what went wrong in the last match         
	We actually played too many shots. The moment we got going, we got out. We didnt have too many early partnerships. So I guess we need to assess the conditions better in the next game and make a proper plan.         
	The total India have on their minds         
	We dont set a total because we have a batting line-up that can achieve or score any target. So we just go by our instincts and see what score we can get next time.         
	On Martin Guptills explosive batting         
	We see all the players, all the bowlers, all the batsmen. He batted well yesterday (Wednesday). Well assess our plans again and see in the next game.         
	The loss in the first match         
	Its not a setback. Its the first game of the series. Weve got five one-dayers, three Test matches, another Twenty20. Its a long tour, so were all geared up for it. Its the first game, and we need to assess where we went wrong. We did play a lot of big shots. We just need to assess the conditions better and batsmen need to take more responsibility.         
	The conditions         
	It was a bit cold. But wherever you go, you need to get set for the conditions. Its the first game and we got a good feel. As I said, well come hard in the next game.

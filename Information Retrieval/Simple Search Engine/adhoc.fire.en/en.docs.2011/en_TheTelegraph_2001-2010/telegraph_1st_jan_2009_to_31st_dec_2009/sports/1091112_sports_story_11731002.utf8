The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Changes suggested by MCC
                                                                                                                                   Changes suggested by MCC
                      
	Karachi: Representatives of the MCC world cricket committee, who met ICC cricket committee members in Dubai last week, have suggested the elimination of Powerplay and restriction on the number of overs a bowler can bowl to make ODIs more attractive.         
	We have also suggested that some formula be worked out where a captain does not have to use all his bowlers under a quota of overs restriction, Majid Khan, who attended the meeting, said Wednesday.         
	Majid said another suggestion was to make it mandatory for the fielding side to have at least two or three slips for the first 10 to 15 overs and for four fielders to be placed inside the circle in catching positions.

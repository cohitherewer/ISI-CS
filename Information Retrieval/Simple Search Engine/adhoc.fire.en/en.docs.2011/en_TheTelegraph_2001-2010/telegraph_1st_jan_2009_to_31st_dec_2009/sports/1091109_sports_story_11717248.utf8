The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Point made by captain Ponting
                                                                                                                                     Point made by captain Ponting
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ricky Ponting                                         
	Calcutta: It was with good reasons that, despite a horrendous run in all three Tests of the 2000-01 series in India (three ducks in five innings), Steve Waugh kept faith in Ricky Ponting.         
	Ponting responded with a hundred in a key ODI, helping Australia win that series, at least. Confidence regained, the present captain hasnt really looked back since.         
	Cut to the ongoing Hero Honda Cup and Australias success is as much Pontings as it is that of the country and the team.         
	Actually, a point has been made.         
	India, therefore, should figure prominently in Pontings autobiography or his authorised biography once hes through with cricket.         
	Captain in ODIs since 2002 and in Tests from 2004, Ponting has hardly ever been applauded for being a good, though perhaps somewhat conservative, leader.         
	Indeed, if anything, just about everybody feels that Pontings been lucky as he had the services of Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath, Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist.         
	However, for almost a year now, Ponting has had to do without all four of them and, with a string of first XI players going home from India, the past fortnight turned out to be most challenging.         
	In any case, Australia landed in India without the Michael Clarkes and the Nathan Brackens.         
	Because of the circumstances, more than anything else, then, Ponting has placed the win in the ongoing series as right up there with specials such as the World Cup and Champions Trophy.         
	Under Ponting, Australia have won two World Cups (2003, 2007) and, recently, retained the Champions Trophy which was lifted in 2006.         
	Most captains would probably have been tempted to give up, within, once their dressing room took on the look of a hospital ward. Not Ponting, though.         
	In fact, Ponting has led from the front: 74, 12, 59, 52, 45 and 25 (Guwahati). It helps when the captain sets the agenda, be it by opening or otherwise.         
	Some weeks ago, during the Champions Trophy, Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam had told The Telegraph: I regard Ponting very highly (as captain).         
	Having sat in the hot seat himself, Intikhab does know a thing or two about captaincy and, clearly, is a good judge of leaders.         
	Intikhabs view, mind you, was expressed not long after the Ashes, where the winning captain was Andrew Strauss.         
	Ponting is known to talk straight, both in the dressing room and outside. He bats straight, too, a quality which has taken him to 11,345 Test runs (136 matches, 38x100, 55.88 average) and 12,311 runs in ODIs (330 appearances, 28x100, average of 43.19).         
	Absolutely awesome figures.         
	Weeks away from his 35th birthday, Ponting couldnt have asked for a better gift. For Australias captain, nothing will change even if the hosts make it 3-4, on Wednesday.         
	Only the very brave or reckless would, however bet on that happening.

  - Bowling wide of the crease, closer to the stumps very important for getting the ball to swing    Cricket   Online-  Ravi   Shastri                                                        
	I am a right-arm medium pacer. Though I bowl an off stump line, my deliveries constantly fall short of length despite my best efforts to pitch the ball up. Please help.              
	(Sumantra Banerjee, 17, Calcutta)              
	Stay high in your action, and dont drop your leading shoulder too quickly. Watch the spot you want the ball to land.               
	I am a righthanded batsman. I often get bowled or am adjudged leg before when attempting the flick. Please help.              
	(Samir Ghosh, 19, Calcutta-15)

	Watch the ball and dont commit yourself into the shot early.               
	I have a very aggressive approach to my batting. Often I get runs in one-dayers, but it does not always work in 2/3-day games. Should I change the approach?              
	(Debjit Guha, 17, Calcutta)              
	Stay aggressive but focus more on shot selection.               
	I am a left-arm spinner. I often bowl too many wide balls. My coach says my head isnt still at the time of delivery. Please help.              
	(Rohit Sen, 19, Calcutta)              
	He is right. Also watch the spot you want the ball to land.               
	I am a righthanded batsman. Whenever I try to lift the ball over the boundary ropes it doesnt reach too far. Is it due to less of bottom-hand into the shot?              
	(Jitendra Singh, 19, Jamshedpur)              
	Check your grip and focus on your follow through.               
	How important is bowling wide of the crease, closer to the stumps while swinging the ball?              
	(Debapriya Raut, 19, Guwahati)              
	Very important. It acts as a good variation.               
	While fending a rising delivery I often take my eyes of the ball resulting in a catch to one of the close-in fielders. How do I solve this problem?              
	(Tapash Gha, 23, Siliguri)              
	Keep your head still and dont take your eyes of the ball.               
	I am a medium pacer but often fail to maintain line and length. Should I sacrifice pace and concentrate on accuracy?              
	(T. Barua, 19, Guwahati)              
	Work with your coach on getting the basics of your action right. It will make a difference.               
	I am a slip fielder. How can I improve my reflexes?              
	(Tanmoy Datta, 20, Calcutta)              
	Work hard on your fitness by doing some good fielding drills and lots of stretching.

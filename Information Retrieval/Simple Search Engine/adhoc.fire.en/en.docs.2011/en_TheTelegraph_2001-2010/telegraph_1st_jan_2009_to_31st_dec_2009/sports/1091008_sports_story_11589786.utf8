	Salgaocar, who controlled the proceedings in the first half, took the lead in the 4th minute, when Ekena Ikenwa headed home a corner kick taken from the right by Manjit Singh. Dempos Roberto Dsilva equalised in the 48th minute off a pass from Nicolau Borges, who was later awarded the man of the match.

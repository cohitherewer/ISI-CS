The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Maiden century for Pandey
                                                                                                                                   Maiden century for Pandey
                      
	Meerut: Youngster Manish Pandey cracked an unbeaten 194 and Rahul Dravid (97) showed he was in great touch before the Sri Lanka series as Karnataka piled up 372 for five against Uttar Pradesh on the opening day of their Ranji Trophy Super League Group B match here Tuesday.         
	The highlight of the Karnataka innings was the mammoth 273-run partnership for the fourth wicket between Pandey and Dravid.         
	Pandey, who was the first Indian player to hit a century in the Indian Premier League, struck 27 boundaries and a huge six during his 238-ball stay. This was Pandeys maiden Ranji century. Experienced Dravid, giving support to the 20-year-old, hit 15 boundaries during his 185-ball innings but only when he was nearing his century, a quick throw by Ravikant Shukla found him short of the crease.         
	In Chandigarh, Ravi Inder Singh (104) stood tall amid ruins with a gritty century as Ajit Agarkar and Zaheer Khan ripped apart the Punjab batting line up to help Mumbai reduce the hosts to 242 for nine. India discard Agarkar took four for 41 while Zaheer, returning after a shoulder injury, grabbed three for 45.

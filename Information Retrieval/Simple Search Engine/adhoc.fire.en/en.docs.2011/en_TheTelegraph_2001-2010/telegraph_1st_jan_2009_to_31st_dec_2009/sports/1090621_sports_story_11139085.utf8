The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Roger to open on Centre Court
                                                   Roger to open on Centre Court
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	London: Roger Federers match against Yen-Hsun Lu will be the first on Centre Court at Wimbledon this year following the withdrawal of Rafael Nadal.         
	The defending champion traditionally opens proceedings on the first day, but following Nadals decision to withdraw after suffering with tendonitis in his knee, five-time champion Federer will get the tournament underway, gunning for his 15th Grand Slam title.         
	Championship officials have therefore decided to play the bottom half of the mens and womens singles on Monday.         
	That means third seed Andy Murray will have to wait until Tuesday to begin his quest to become the first British winner of the mens singles since 1936.         
	Concern for Nadals future in tennis has been growing since he announced he would be absent from SW19, with a number of Spanish media outlets questioning the potential threat the injury could have on the rest of his career.         
	El Mundo said Nadals announcement on had revived the debate about the Mallorcans aggressive, athletic style of play and the damage to his body.         
	The huge amount of pressure he put on his muscles and joints was in sharp contrast to the elegance of Swiss world number two Roger Federer, it wrote.         
	Concern aside, it did recognise that the break Nadal took when he missed last years Masters Cup and Spains Davis Cup match, had in fact set him up for the best start to a season throughout his career.         
	After finally claiming the French crown and completing his career Grand Slam, Federer said he could now play without pressure.         
	Now, going into the grasscourt season, and Wimbledon, and being on top of the world, its a fantastic feeling, said the Swiss.

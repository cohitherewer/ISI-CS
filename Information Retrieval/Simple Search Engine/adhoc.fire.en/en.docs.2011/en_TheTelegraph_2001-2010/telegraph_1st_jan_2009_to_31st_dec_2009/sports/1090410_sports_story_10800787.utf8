                                                     India get warning from FIH
  - World cup hockey       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT    
	New Delhi: The international hockey federation (FIH) president Leandro Negre on Thursday threatened to shift the 2010 World Cup to Malaysia if elections for the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) were not held within six months.         
	The World Cup is scheduled to be held here from March 7-20 next year.         
	The FIH chief, who played for Spain in the 1968 Olympics in Mexico, is currently here to hold discussion with the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and the ad hoc committee on the World Cup.         
	We would all be extremely happy to have the World Cup in India. The entire hockey world is looking forward to it, said Negre. But there are certain things we cannot compromise on.         
	He said it was necessary for the ad hoc committee to hold elections. We have given them a six-month deadline. At the same time, the mens and the womens committee should also come together to form a united body.         
	The FIH is not here to dictate terms but to offer advice. We will be watching the situation keenly. If worst comes to worst, our Plan B is ready. The World Cup can be shifted to Malaysia. They have the infrastructure ready to host the tournament, said the former goalkeeper.         
	He also said the FIH is ready to extend every possible help to India in their quest for hosting the World Cup.         
	We will take some time and study the findings of our visit. We are here to know the situation, meet administrators and advice them. We will support them, but FIH wont involve in any internal affairs. It is up to the Indian authorities to resolve the issue, he said.         
	The member of the ad hoc committee, Aslam Khan, and Indian womens hockey federation chairman Amrit Bose, were present when the FIH boss served the ultimatum.         
	Asked whether the elections could be held unless the deposed IHF president K.P.S. Gill did not withdraw the court case, Aslam Khan refused to comment.         
	The IOA secretary general Randhir Singh said he was hopeful of holding the IHF elections. If there is a will, there is a way, he remarked.         
	It may be recalled that the Bengal Hockey Association (BHA) president J.B. Roy has already demanded immediate elections for the IHF.         
	Negre expressed satisfaction over the recent progress of the Indian team and said a strong showing by the host nation is essential to the success of the showpiece event. For organising the World Cup, we need a good performance from India. Their performance hasnt been good in the past few years.         
	The FIH president, however, made it clear that he was satisfied with what he has seen during his visit and security and other issues wont come in the way of Indias hosting rights.         
	Meanwhile, on the issue of Indias foreign coach, Aslam Khan said they are one step away from finalising the coach.         
	India are without a head coach for the last eight months after Australian Ric Charlesworth resigned last July. Although, Spaniard Jose Brasa is tipped to take charge after meeting ad hoc committee officials three months ago, a final decision is still pending. The process regarding the coach is in its final stages. A final offer has been sent to Brasa and we are expecting to settle the issue within a month, Aslam said.

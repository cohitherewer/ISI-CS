The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand held 
                                                   Anand held 
                      
	Linares: World champion Viswanathan Anand played out a draw with Russian Alexander Grischuk to remain in joint fourth spot at the end of the seventh round of the Magistral Ciudad de Linares Chess tournament here on Thursday.         
	At the half way stage of the eight-player double round robin tournament, the Indian ace has 3.5 points.         
	Grischuk stayed at the top of the table with five points out of a possible seven and remained a full point clear of Norwegian prodigy Magnus Carlsen and Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine         
	Carlsen played out a draw with Teimour Radjabov while Ivanchuk scored a win over Levon Aronian of Armenia.         
	Anand shares the fourth spot with Aronian whose double defeat in the last two rounds have severely dented his chances. Grischuk held on to his own against Anand whose experiment with the queen pawn opening continued.         
	After coming out with a minor surprise on move three when he decided to avoid main lines of Grunfeld defense, Anand settled to play the Samisch attack against the Kings Indian defence.         
	Anand tried to make a foray on the king-side but the Russian was quite up to the task of finding the right manoeuvres. After Anand castled on the king-side, it was clear that the game was headed towards a draw. The peace was signed in 32 moves.

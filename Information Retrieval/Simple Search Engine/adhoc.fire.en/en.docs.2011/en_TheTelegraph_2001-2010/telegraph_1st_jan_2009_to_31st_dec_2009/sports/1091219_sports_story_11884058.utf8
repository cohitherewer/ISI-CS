            A STAFF REPORTER            Iresh Saxena at the JU, Salt Lake campus ground, on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: The moment Delhis wicket-keeper batsman Puneet Bisht tucked Ashok Dinda towards square-leg for a couple of runs to reach the magic figure of 373, the Bengal versus Delhi match became drudgery. The two runs ensured that Delhi avoided the ignominy of following on.         
	The match as a contest was over on Thursday itself when Baroda lost a wicket in their tie versus Maharashtra and with it the chance of getting the bonus point. For Delhi, it was a matter of pride to avoid humiliation in a match that saw them qualifying for the knockout stage.         
	Delhi started the day at 348 for seven but left-arm spinner Iresh Saxena (5/72) removed overnight batsman Ishant Sharma (16) and Parvinder Awana (2) in quick succession as Delhi went to 364 for nine.         
	With a wicket in hand and nine runs left to avoid follow on, it was left to Bisht to take Delhi past danger.         
	Last-man Vishal Sharma (2) hung on grimly for 52 minutes as Delhi scored 378 to finish 144 runs behind Bengals first innings score of 522.         
	Delhi, who had to make up for the over shortage, then bowled 61 overs as the Bengal batsmen helped themselves to 227 for three. Openers Arindam Das (102 retired out, 15x4) and Rohan Banerjee (77) added 186 runs for the opening wicket.         
	At the end of it, Delhi were through with 16 points while Bengal stayed in the Super League with 11 points in their kitty.         
	With Bengals Ranji season coming to an end, veteran Sourav Ganguly also decided to bring down curtains on his first-class career. It has been learnt that Sourav has told the selectors not to consider him for longer version anymore.         
	Incidentally, Ganguly topped Bengals batting averages this season with 62. He scored 310 in five innings. He is fourth in the list of run getters behind Arindam Das (513), Manoj Tiwary (399), Wriddhiman Saha (318).

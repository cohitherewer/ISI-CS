The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fake tickets pushed Wanderers to the brink
                                                   Fake tickets pushed Wanderers to the brink
                      
	Johannesburg: Celebration could have actually turned into mourning after it was revealed that nearly 38,000 spectators watched Sundays Indian Premier League final in the Wanderers Stadium which can host 31,000 at the most.         
	According to a South African newspaper, an additional 7000-strong crowd made their way into the stadium wielding counterfeit tickets, which could have led to a disaster.         
	Gauteng Cricket Board chief executive officer Alan Kourie admitted coming across an incredible number of counterfeit tickets and said the stadium had never been such full.         
	Weve informed the metro police about the tickets we found but we suspect there must have been many more because I have never before seen the stadium this full. Its dangerous, Kourie said.         
	On the grass embankment, the family area on the west of the stadium, they were packed in like sardines; there was no room to move there at all. On the open stand, it was just ridiculous.         
	In both the Unity Stand and the Centenary Stand, there were people sitting in the aisles and standing behind the seats. We were sold out for the Australia game and I can tell you that it was not as full as this, he said.         
	This is our stadium and we know it intimately. You can tell from experience how many people are in the stadium at any given time, and we reckon there are more than 35,000 in here, possibly 38,000, Kourie added.

                                                   Sharks out of depth
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Champions League T20 at the Kotla continued to be a drab affair as the New South Wales Blues defeated Sussex Sharks by 35 runs in another one-sided Group B match Sunday.         
	The sparse holiday crowd had little to be excited about as the Australians first scored 130 for two before restricting Sussex to 95 for 8 and record their second victory in as many matches thereby entering the next round.         
	After the Blues Phillip Hughes launched an assault on the Sussex bowling, Man of the Match Moises Henriques, who plays for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL, took over. He had struck three sixes against Diamond Eagles in their last match and almost did a repeat when he hit Rory Hamilton Brown over extra cover and then cleared the long-on boundary off James Kirtleys bowling. He scored 51 and was involved in an unbroken 90-run third wicket partnership with Hughes.         
	Hughess batting in the New South Wales innings was the best thing about the match. On a wicket that continued to be low and sluggish, the 21-year-old youngster displayed the maturity of a veteran to slam an unbeaten 62 off 64 deliveries.         
	It was a difficult pitch to bat on, Henriques said after the match. I was scrambling and was happy to get to the other end. Later I could hit the ball with the middle of the bat.

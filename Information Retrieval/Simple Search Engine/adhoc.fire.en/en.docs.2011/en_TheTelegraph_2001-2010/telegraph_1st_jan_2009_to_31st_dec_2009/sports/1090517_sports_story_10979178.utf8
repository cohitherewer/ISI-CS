The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan may opt for a dialogue
                                                   Bagan may opt for a dialogue
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan are on fire-fighting mode to repair the damage the Bhaichung Bhutia show-cause controversy has caused the club. Sources in Bagan said efforts are on to organise a meeting between club secretary Anjan Mitra and the skipper so that the matter can be settled amicably.         
	Bhaichung returns from Mumbai on Sunday and is expected to hold a news conference the next day. The source said that Bhaichung might launch a scathing attack on Mitra and that may lead to more friction.         
	The Bagan executive committee would have an informal meeting on Sunday and we would try to convince the secretary to go easy on Bhaichung. We want to settle the matter amicably, a source said.

                                                   Got to be focused: Dhoni
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mahendra Singh Dhoni has warned his teammates against complacency as they get ready to defend their ICC T20 World Championship title. India are grouped with minnows Ireland and Bangladesh in the league stage of the 12-team tournament in England but the Indian skipper reminded his players of the fate that befell the ODI team in the 2007 World Cup and urged them to hit the ground running when the championship kicks off on June 5.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q Are you confident of retaining the title?         
	A We are a side that is best suited for T20. We have the specialists as well as the part-timers, plenty of options to choose from We are quite confident but it all comes down to playing well on the day. We cant relax, particularly in the knock-out stage. The format of the game is such that one player can take the game away from you. We have to be focused and play to our potential.         
	Is there the pressure of being the defending champions, especially on the youngsters?         
	Being T20 champions doesnt really add to the pressure. We have all been playing in the IPL and the tournament helps when it comes to handling pressure. The part-time bowlers are under tremendous pressure while bowling the final overs. Similarly, the batsmen are under pressure to score runs in the death. The IPL has helped youngsters in handling pressure.         
	Happy to have Bangladesh and Ireland in the group?         
	We have to remember that in the 50 overs-a-side game, we lost to Bangladesh in the World Cup. So we cant relax. We have to get the momentum going from the start. We can do our experiments in the practice matches but once the tournament starts we have to stick to the method that has worked for us.         
	Will playing the IPL just before the championship be of benefit or a drawback to the team?         
	There are both positives and negatives to it. It has given the youngsters great exposure but it could also be tiring. The advantage is that the IPL has been a platform to try out strategies. Players like Yusuf Pathan, Rohit Sharma and Suresh Raina can not only bat but also bowl part-time. Yuvraj (Singh) of course took two hattrick. Overall, I think there are more benefits.         
	Will fatigue be a factor?         
	We have got used to it. We play throughout the year. Since making my debut in 2004, I have been playing consistently. Its part of Indian cricket.         
	Who do you think are the favourites?         
	I think in T20, all teams are equal. Every game is going to be important, you can never relax. One game you could have an off-day and the opponents could play well. So each game will be a do-or-die one.         
	The team were given a red carpet welcome when they won the inaugural edition in 2007. But the reaction could be another extreme if they lose. Are you concerned by that?         
	Thats part and parcel of cricket. You cant really think about the outcome. We have had the best preparation and now we have to focus and play to our potential in the 17 days.         
	How much do you think you have grown as a captain in the last two years?         
	I am really blessed with a side that is very talented. Each individual wants to perform and do something special for the country. Whatever plans given to them, they try their best to do it. Most of the times I am not under the same pressure as some other captains.         
	You batted in different slots in the IPL. Whats going to be your role in England?         
	My role in IPL is different from that in international cricket. In the IPL you have four foreigners you play at a slot that lifts the strength of the team. In the championship, my role will depend on what form the batsmen are in. We are definitely a side that is batting heavy but it doesnt mean that we are not a good bowling side.

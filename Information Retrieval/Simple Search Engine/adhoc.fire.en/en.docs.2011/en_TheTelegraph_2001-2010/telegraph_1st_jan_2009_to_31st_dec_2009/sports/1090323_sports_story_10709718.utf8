The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Two more Knights from Bengal
                                                   Two more Knights from Bengal
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Two more Bengal cricketers found their way into the Kolkata Knight Riders fold for the second edition of the Indian Premier League on Sunday when Arindam Ghosh and pacer Sourav Sarkar were named in the 28-member squad.         
	Young all-rounder Sunny Singh and batsman Shoaib Sheikh were also included. The KKR squad was trimmed to 28 from the 57 players named in the initial list last month. Ghosh, Sarkar, Sunny and Sheikh are the latest cricketers to be awarded KKR contracts.         
	The KKR squad now consists of seven from Bengal, including Ghosh and Sarkar. Last years captain Sourav Ganguly, Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla, stumper Wriddhiman Saha, batsman Debabrata Das and pacer Ashok Dinda are the others.         
	KKR cricket manager John Buchanan, on the sidelines of a function to announce a tie-up between the franchise and mobile phone manufacturer Nokia, described Ghosh as an exciting talent and Sarkar as one who hits the deck pretty hard.         
	The former Australia coach also praised Sheikh. He has a lot of inventiveness and creativity in power hitting. Buchanan said Sunnys power hitting will be of great help to the team.         
	The KKR squad is likely to be pruned down further to 22 cricketers after the next camp, scheduled to start in a couple of days.         
	Buchanan also defended the inclusion of off-spinner Mohnish Parmar, who is known to have a suspect action.         
	Parmar has received some training and has come up the ranks of the National Cricket Academy. I think he is fit to play, Buchanan said.         
	Note: Ricky Ponting and Umar Gul are still part of the KKR squad. The franchise have taken Morne van Wyk in place of Ponting and Charl Langeveldt as Guls replacement for this edition.

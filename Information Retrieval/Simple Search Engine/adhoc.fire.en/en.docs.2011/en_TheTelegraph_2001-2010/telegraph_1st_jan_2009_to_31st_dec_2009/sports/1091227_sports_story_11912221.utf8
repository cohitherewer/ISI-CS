            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Guwahati: Mohammedan Sportings dismal run in the Hero Honda 31st Federation Cup came to an end with a solitary goal loss to Chirag United at the Nehru Stadium, here on Saturday.         
	PC Lalawmpuia scored the all-important goal in the 31st minute. This was Lalawmpuias first goal of the season for Chirag United.         
	Already out of contention, both teams lacked intensity but Sporting appeared to be short on motivation, creativity and co-ordination more than their rivals.         
	Playing without regulars like Eduardo Escobar and Theodore Sunday, Mohammedan Sporting actually did well to lose by the slimmest possible margin. Its not just regulars, Sporting were also without coach Shabbir Ali in the dug-out as the Shabbir had to rush to Hyderabad to attend some urgent personal matter.         
	The goal was a result of some very sloppy defending and bungle by Sporting goalkeeper Manash Baruah.         
	Instead of gathering a corner which was travelling almost parallel to the goalline, he tried to kick it away. His feeble clearance that found a waiting Lalawmpuia who obliged with a cool tap-in.

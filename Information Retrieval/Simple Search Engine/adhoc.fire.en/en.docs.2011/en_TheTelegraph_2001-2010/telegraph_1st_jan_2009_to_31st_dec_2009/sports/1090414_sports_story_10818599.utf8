                                                   Eloquent wax has Sachin spellbound
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Cricket had bestowed on Sachin Tendulkar immortality in the abstract sense quite sometime ago, but the worlds leading batsman attained immortality of another kind on Monday, thanks to the wax model made by the renowned sculptors of Madame Tussauds.         
	I am glad he doesnt breathe. Its that close, said a visibly excited Tendulkar after unveiling his life-size statue.         
	The Mumbaikar becomes the first Indian sportsperson to be featured at the famous wax museum in London, where the statue will be premiered on April 24, the day the Master Blaster turns 36.         
	Mahatma Gandhi, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, and Bollywood stars Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan are some of the other Indians featured at Tussauds which has branches world over including at New York, Amsterdam, Berlin and Hong Kong.         
	Tendulkar will be placed in the museums sports zone where his contemporaries Brian Lara and Shane Warne already stand alongside other sport legends such as Muhammad Ali, Jesse Owens, Tiger Woods and David Beckham.         
	I am feeling very proud. And that it will be opened on April 24, my birthday, makes me even happier. I consider it as a reflection, a recognition of my contribution to Indian cricket, Tendulkar said.         
	The whole process spanned nearly four months, involved 500 measurements, consumed more than a thousand kilogram of wax (which is roughly equivalent to 16,000 candles), and cost 150,000.         
	It all began in January with Tussauds sculptors flying down to Mumbai to take Tendulkars measurements.         
	The inputs, supplemented by references from newspaper pictures, were used by the sculptors at their West London studio to create, first a clay model from which moulds are made to make the wax figure. Then followed the crucial stage where skilled artists plant real hair by hand and produce the skin tones using multiple layers of oil paint.         
	Made of Japan wax, which has a melting point of 53 degrees Centigrade, the man-made image is certain to keep Tendulkar and his exploits alive, unless his creators decide to take him out of the museum.         
	So, how did he feel when he first looked at himself, dressed in full cricket gear, the pose itself the moment when he had broken Brian Laras world record to become the highest run-getter in Tests  his head and the two hands up towards the sky in celebration?         
	I am finding it difficult to express how I feel  I have never reacted to anything like this in life. Its something special ... to see something so identical, Tendulkar said.

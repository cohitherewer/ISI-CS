The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Closer than we thought: Dhoni
                                                   Closer than we thought: Dhoni
                      
	Kingston: Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has said that the first ODI against the West Indies was closer than it looked despite the visitors 20-run win.         
	He admitted that his teammates got complacent after polishing the West Indies top-order, who nearly toppled India in the high scoring first one-dayer here on Friday.         
	India had set the hosts a massive 340-run target at Sabina Park.         
	Most of the guys thought that we have won the game when they were seven wickets down but it was a mistake and hopefully we wont repeat that. It was closer than we thought, he said after the match.         
	Speaking about Yuvraj Singh, who played a magnificent knock of 131, he said: He has matured as a batsman in the last couple of years. We rely a lot on him. He gets big runs for us in the middle-order.         
	Dhoni said handing Ashish Nehra the ball in the closing stages was a gamble which paid off.         
	It was a gamble. We were thinking of giving that over to an off-spinner or a pacer. Finally we chose a pacer as the ball was doing reverse swing, he said.         
	Chris Gayle was not unhappy with his team even after the defeat and praised the youngsters.         
	It was a good effort. We batted well. Darren (Bravo), who was making his debut, was also impressive. Shiv played a good innings at the top, he said.         
	He also praised the Indian batsmen, particularly Yuvraj. He set up his innings well. Having said that it was a good game. It was a flat track and small boundaries were there. Its tough to contain batsmen like Yuvraj and Dhoni.         
	Man-of-the-Match Yuvraj said he exercised restrain to get set before exploding.         
	I was getting used to the pace initially. After getting 25-30 runs I was comfortable. I got the momentum and played my shots. The partnership with Dinesh (Karthik) and Dhoni got us to the big total, he said.

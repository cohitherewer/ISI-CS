                                                   Top spot at stake
                      
	Durban: South Africa and Australia will be playing for the No. 1 one-day ranking when their five-match series begins Friday at Kingsmead.         
	Australia relinquished the top spot to the Proteas after losing 1-4 at home earlier this year.         
	But South Africa, despite not bringing their best form to the World Cups, have maintained a high win rate with great fielding and bowling and a batting line-up stacked with talent like Herschelle Gibbs, A.B. de Villiers, Graeme Smith, Jacques Kallis and J.P. Duminy.         
	In Australia a couple of months ago, stand-in captain Johan Bothas off spin and all-rounder Albie Morkels big hitting took South Africa to a convincing ODI series win.         
	South Africa will have Smith back in the team after the captain had a finger broken by fast bowler Mitchell Johnson.         
	Its always good to get the opportunity to bowl with the new ball against an opening batsman like Smith. Hes such a great player, Johnson said. Im looking forward to trying to get his wicket. Smith averages 42.21 in 15 ODIs against Australia, but that rises to 61 with a top score of 119 not out against the same opponents in South Africa.         
	South Africa coach Mickey Arthur is upbeat after the Proteas two Twenty20 victories over Australia on Friday and Sunday.         
	Theres a nice air around the squad, Arthur said.         
	The guys are very fresh and looking forward to it. Were getting a nice balance now. Im very happy with the mix we have now.         
	Within our squad, we have two recognised spinners and we have J.P. Duminy, who can bowl for us as well, so were starting to get quite a nice mix in terms of variation in our attack. And the return of Makhaya (Ntini) and Morne (Morkel) in our attack is really good because they give us variation of a different kind.         
	Its always good to be in a dressing room thats winning  its a good place to be  but were not looking too much to that. Friday is where we want to put our marker in the sand, and thats why weve been building up hard this week.         
	Friday, for us, is huge. We want to go 1-0 up, and hopefully take momentum from that.         
	Australia have won 37 of 72 ODIs against South Africa, losing 32 and tying three. At Kingsmead, the Australians have won three of five matches, including the past two in 2002 and 2006.

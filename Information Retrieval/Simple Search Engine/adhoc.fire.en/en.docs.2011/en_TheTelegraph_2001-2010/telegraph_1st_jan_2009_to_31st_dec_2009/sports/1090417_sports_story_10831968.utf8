                                                   Kings XI get back cash
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A South African businessman returned Rand 450,000 to the Kings XI Punjab team on Thursday, which he recovered in one of the hotel rooms which the IPL team occupied in Port Elizabeth.         
	Stephen Blewett, the chief of Altech Autopage Cellular, found a bundle of Rand 4,50,000 (nearly Rs 2.5 million) in his hotel room, earlier occupied by Kings XI Punjab. It is not common for us to carry that amount of money but we have a lot of costs and the money was not yet distributed to the players, said the teams liaison officer.         
	Meanwhile, IPL commissioner Lalit Modi along with Bollywood stars Shah Rukh Khan, Shilpa Shetty and Preity Zinta, launched the Miss Bollywood SA competition in Cape Town on Thursday. The winner will win a role in a Bollywood movie, Rs 50,000 in cash and a business class trip to India.

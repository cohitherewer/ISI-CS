                                                   Keen contest on the cards
                      
	Bangalore: Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh will be on opposite sides when their respective teams, Air India Blue and Air India Red, meet in the final of Sahara BCCI Corporate Trophy here Wednesday.         
	Both teams reached the title round in similar fashion  Air India Blue beat Tata Sports Club by five wickets while Air India Red defeated Gautam Gambhir-led ONGC by a similar margin.         
	There is no doubt that Yuvrajs side knows the conditions here better, having played three matches. But with the likes of Chandan Madan and Manvinder Bisla in fine form, Air India Blue are no pushovers, which will make it a keenly-contested day-night match, weather permitting.         
	Air India Red also have a solid line-up led by Yuvraj. Robin Uthappa, Suresh Raina and Naman Ojha are proven performers.

	Christchurch: A major crisis in New Zealand Cricket (NZC) was averted when six of the countrys leading players agreed to sign new contracts with the board, but only after they were assured of playing a major part of the third Indian Premier League (IPL), a New Zealand daily said Saturday.         
	Daniel Vettori, Brendon McCullum, Kyle Mills, Jacob Oram, Jesse Ryder and Ross Taylor were among the 20 players who signed contracts with NZC Friday.         
	A crisis was averted after a draft copy of the schedule showed stumps will be pulled on March 31, effectively turning the traditional end-of-summer six-week tour into a two-Test affair, the daily said.

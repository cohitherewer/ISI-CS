The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Deepika hits bullseye, Boro wins bronze
                                                   Deepika hits bullseye, Boro wins bronze
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Deepika Kumari put in an irresistible performance to win gold in the cadet recurve event at the 11th Youth World Archery Championship in Ogden (Utah) on Sunday. Adding to the Indian contingents joy was Sanjay Boro who won the bronze medal playoff to occupy the third position in the mens cadet recurve category.         
	Deepika becomes only the second Indian to win a world title in archery. Palton Hansda was the first to earn that distinction when he won the junior compound individual gold medal in the ninth edition of the world championship, in 2006 at Merida (Mexico).         
	Deepika was consistent throughout the championship. The fourth seed had scored 115 out of 120 in the quarter finals, 112 in the semis and, in the final, shot 115 points to beat her 10th ranked Russian opponent Sayana Tsyrempilova, who managed 109, according to information received here on Monday.         
	Sanjay Boro from Assam, seeded seventh, too showed enough promise early on to win the bronze medal beating 29th ranked Antonio Hector Smith of Mexico 110-105. The cadet category is for under-16 archers and the junior category is for those under 18 years of age.         
	Deepika was unstoppable from the moment she shot her first arrow into the nine ring. The first end of three arrows fetched her 29 points and she had a matching score in the second end of three.         
	Only in the third did she shoot two 9s and a 10 for 28 points but by then she had a 6 point lead (86-80) going into the last end of three arrows. A 9 and then a 10 followed by another 10 ensured gold for the girl from Jharkhand.

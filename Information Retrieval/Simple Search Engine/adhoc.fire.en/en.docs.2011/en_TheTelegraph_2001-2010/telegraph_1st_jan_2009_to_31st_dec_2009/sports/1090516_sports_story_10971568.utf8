The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Miandad: Fixing a possibility
                                                   Miandad: Fixing a possibility
                      
	Karachi: He may consider the Indian Premier League (IPL) a joke but former Pakistan captain Javed Miandad feels that there is a serious possibility of matches being fixed in the cash-rich Twenty20 event.         
	Miandad said the IPL, currently underway in South Africa, has been witness to some surprising results where teams have lost from winning positions. There is a definite smell of match-fixing coming from the IPL where strange things are happening, he said on Friday.         
	I dont consider the IPL as cricket, it is a joke. It is strange that players who are not regular bowlers have taken hat-tricks in the league. Teams are losing matches from winning positions, he said.         
	Miandad feels the International Cricket Council (ICC) needs to step in and check possible corruption. If at all such Twenty20 cricket leagues must be held, they should be held under the direct supervision of the ICC or else there will always be fear of corruption taking place in matches, he said.         
	Miandad said it was strange that the ICCs anti-corruption unit was not present in the IPL. The IPL organisers rejected an ICC offer to have the anti-corruption unit supervise this years tournament and have arranged for their own security and anti-corruption officers.

    - Tiger accused of offering $1 million to stop rachel from talking             Nick Allen            Tiger Woods                                 
	Los Angeles: Tiger Woods has been accused of offering $1 million to silence one of the women linked to him but the fallout from his domestic crisis is going to cost the golfer much more than that.         
	New York club promoter Rachel Uchitel, who has denied having an affair with the golf superstar, called a news conference to give more details of her relationship with the world No.1 golfer.         
	But hours before she and her lawyer were due to speak the news conference was cancelled amid speculation that she had been in discussion with Woodss representatives.         
	According to celebrity website Radar Online, Uchitel was offered $1 million (600,000) not to talk. Her lawyer declined comment.         
	However, the daughter of high-profile attorney Gloria Allred says that her mother cancelling the news conference could mean only one thing  she made a deal with the Woods camp.         
	Lisa Bloom, Allreds daughter and a legal analyst with a television news channel, estimated that such a settlement would be at least a million dollars.         
	Allred, said the news conference was cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances but did not give further details.         
	Uchitel, 34, was the first woman to be linked to Woods in a report in the National Enquirier. She is said to have been with Woods in Australia when he competed in a tournament there.         
	She has subsequently vehemently denied an affair but rumours were circulating ahead of the news conference that she was about to reveal details damaging to Woods and that she had numerous text messages from him.         
	As Woods recovered from the wounds to his face, the golfer was also facing a hefty hit to his wallet. He has been forced to renegotiate his prenuptial agreement, which could lead to his wife receiving a record $300million (180million) in any future divorce.         
	Woods and his wife Elin Nordegren, 29, are trying to save their marriage and have been undergoing counselling several times a day at their home in Orlando, Florida.         
	When the couple married on October 5, 2004, Nordegren signed an agreement, which would stagger payments, and was initially modest by A-list celebrity standards.         
	The agreement was said to have given her the right to $20million after 10 years of marriage.         
	In the light of Woodss recent transgressions, the amount has been increased to $75million and the period reduced to seven years.         
	Woods was believed to have transferred $5million into his wifes bank account on Thursday.         
	Experts said Nordegren could ultimately receive one of the largest celebrity settlements, dwarfing the $150million paid by Michael Jordan, the basketball star, to his former wife Juanita.         
	Kalika Moquin, a third woman linked to Woods, also denied any romantic association. The Las Vegas club promoter said: Sometimes Ill deal with celebrities on my job just to touch base with people.         
	But its completely untrue that theres anything more than a professional How are you doing? Are you enjoying your time in Vegas? conversation with Tiger.         
	The pinball trajectory of his Cadillac, meanwhile, was revealed in a police sketch, which showed the golfing superstar had three collisions, not two as was previously thought.         
	Woods was driving so erratically before his mysterious car crash that he careered into bushes and hedges, up two concrete kerbs and swerved across a street before ploughing into a fire hydrant and a tree.

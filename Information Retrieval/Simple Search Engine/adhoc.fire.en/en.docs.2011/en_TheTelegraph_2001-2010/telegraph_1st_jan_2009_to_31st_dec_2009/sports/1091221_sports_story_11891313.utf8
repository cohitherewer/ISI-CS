The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barca must be ready for dip: Pep
                                                                                                                       7                                      Barca must be ready for dip: Pep
                      
	Abu Dhabi: Barcelona have reached such heady heights in 2009 that they must be prepared for a fall, coach Pep Guardiola said after their Club World Cup victory.         
	The European champions beat Argentinas Estudiantes 2-1 after extra time to lift their sixth trophy this year, adding the world crown to La Liga, Champions League, Kings Cup and Spanish and European Super Cups.         
	Now were going to descend a bit from our stardom, but we have talent and we got here with hard work. Were going to be alright, he told the post-final news conference Saturday.         
	Six titles is unequalled, this brings more responsibility... We have to continue working to remain among the elite.         
	Ill never forget its the players who achieved this and the ones who gain me my prestige (as a coach), added Guardiola, who lost world club finals twice before with Barcelona, as a player in 1992 in the former Intercontinental Cup and as coach in 2006.         
	Guardiolas big off-season signing Zlatan Ibrahimovic said: Playing always to win, you have more chances of winning.         
	One of the reasons I came to Barca was to win titles... I hope we continue to win many more trophies.         
	Estudiantes coach Alejandro Sabella, whose team were looking for their second world title, praised Barcelonas tactical variety and calmness.         
	He also pointed to their strength in depth, adding that not even injuries could throw them off their game as they had international players on the bench.         
	Barcelona were hit by another injury during the match, with midfielder Seydou Keita injuring his thigh. He would be out for about three weeks, the club said.         
	Sabella said Estudiantes would regroup and focus on new goals, the Argentine Clausura championship starting at the end of next month and defending their Libertadores Cup title.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Manou replaces Paine
                                                     Manou replaces Paine
  - South Australian captain rewarded for impressive performances in domestic cricket       A STAFF REPORTER            Tim Paine                                 
	Calcutta: Graham Manou was Thursday named as Tim Paines replacement for Australias tour of India. Paine, who had fitted in nicely into his countrys ODI scheme of things following an injury to Brad Haddin, fractured the ring finger on his right hand during Wednesdays second ODI in Nagpur.         
	The National Selection Panel (NSP) chairman, Andrew Hilditch, announcing the decision said Paine has been ruled out of further action in this series and that the 24-year-old Tasmanian would return to Australia as soon as the replacement arrives in India.         
	Manou, the South Australian captain, has been despatched post-haste and will be available for selection for the next game.         
	Manou made his Australia debut in England, during the Ashes, and the call-up rewards his impressive showing across formats in Australias domestic season last year.         
	As for Haddin, who has not played first-class cricket since the fifth Ashes Test at the Oval, it is expected he will make a return to first class cricket this weekend as the first stage of his preparation for a return to cricket for Australia.         
	Recently, when asked about the wicketkeepers slot, Australia coach Tim Nielsen had said that although Paine had fit in quite well and was also contributing with the bat, the position belonged to Haddin and the 24-year-old would have to make way once the New South Wales veteran returned from injury.         
	Indeed, Cricket Australia (CA) is keeping a close watch on the wicketkeeper-batsmans recovery but the board does not want to rush things.         
	After extensive discussions with physiotherapist Alex Kountouris and Haddin it was considered premature for him (Haddin) to resume cricket for Australia, having not played first-class cricket since the Oval Ashes Test, CA said in a release Thursday.         
	Australia have been buffeted by injuries ever since the first ODI. The injury list at the end of the tie in Vadodara read Brett Lee, Mitchell Johnson and James Hopes. Although Johnson recovered in time for the second ODI Lee and Hopes had to sit out of the affair in Nagpur. Hopes will miss the third ODI as well but a decision on Lee, it is understood, will be taken on the eve of Saturdays match.         
	It may be recalled that Australia had brought in Moises Henriques as standby for Hopes after the first ODI.         
	Henriques was another youngster brought into what is, by far, the youngest Australian team to tour India. But the team seem to be looking to make up by way of talent what they lose out in experience.         
	Henriques has donned the Kolkata Knight Riders colours in IPL II and enjoyed a successful outing with the New South Wales Blues in the inaugural Champions League T20.

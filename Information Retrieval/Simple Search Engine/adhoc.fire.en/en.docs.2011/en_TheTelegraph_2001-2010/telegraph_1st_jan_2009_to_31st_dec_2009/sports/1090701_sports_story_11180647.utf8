The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dues give AIFF a headache
                                                   Dues give AIFF a headache
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Non payment of dues by its marketing and broadcasting partners has landed the All India Football Federation (AIFF) in deep financial crisis.         
	According to sources, Zee Sports, which holds the sole television and marketing rights of the AIFF, has not cleared dues of close to Rs eight crore, forcing the federation to live off its savings.         
	The AIFF has an annual budget of Rs 23 crore and is heavily dependent on its broadcasting partners, who are expected to pay the federation around Rs 20 crore every season.         
	So alarming is the situation that a section of the people in the AIFF are openly questioning the logic behind spending nearly Rs one crore for the national teams twin tours of Dubai and Spain.         
	We are aware of the importance of the national team but under the present circumstances, the federation should have shown restraint, said a senior executive committee member.         
	Though the government is paying the airfare, the Dubai tour is likely to make the federation poorer by at least Rs 30 lakh. One should have convinced Bob (Houghton) on our financial position, he added.         
	However, a senior AIFF official, who did not wish to be named, remained unperturbed. The payment is being delayed but it will surely come. I am confident our partners will honour the contract.         
	While the federation is living on assurances, the insiders feel things could worsen in the coming months as earnings have been steadily drying up ever since president Priya Ranjan Das Munshis illness last year.         
	For all practical purposes, dada (Das Munshi) remained the sole bread earner for the AIFF, said an executive member. He was the one who made the Zee Sports deal possible. Again, he single-handedly brought in ONGC as title sponsors of the I-League, he said.         
	The AIFF does have a marketing department but so far it has made no significant contribution. It hasnt done anything yet to justify its presence, he added.         
	To add to their woes, ONGCs Rs six crore contract with the AIFF for the I-League has also ended and there is no sign of it getting renewed. So far, no one has approached us for a renewal, said an ONGC official. So bad is the situation that neither AIFF nor its marketing partners could rope in sponsors for two of its biggest tournaments  the Federation Cup and the Santosh Trophy.         
	The cost is ever increasing, said the source. Last season, the I-League cost more than Rs seven crore. This season, because of more teams and venues, the AIFF may have to spend more than Rs 10 crore for the league.         
	Moreover, there is a huge budgetary allocation for the Goal 2011 project. One is at a loss to understand where the money will come from, he added.

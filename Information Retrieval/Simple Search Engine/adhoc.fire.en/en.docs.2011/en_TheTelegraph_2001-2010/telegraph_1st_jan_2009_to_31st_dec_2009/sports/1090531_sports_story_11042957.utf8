The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Weak teams can cause upsets, says Intikhab
                                                   Weak teams can cause upsets, says Intikhab
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam feels Twenty20 is an unpredictable game where even the weaker teams can upset stronger sides with their limited talents.         
	It is a 120-ball innings and any team can cause an upset. In the longer version of the game, eventually weaker teams are found wanting but in T20 cricket, they can escape and do well even with limited talent and exposure, Alam said.         
	Pakistan start their World Twenty20 campaign on June 7 against England, and Alam is backing his team to win the tournament to be held in England next month.         
	I am backing my team to do well in the World Cup because we have players with plenty of T20 experience, Intikhab said before leaving for England.         
	The competition will be tough and our first aim is to qualify from our group, which is not an easy one. But we have got some momentum going with the players having played recently in the series against Australia, some practice matches and in the national T20 tournament, he said. Intikhab said the players had done all the preparations they could possibly do for the tournament, and worked hard in the training sessions. The sessions with the sports psychologist have helped and that is why I am quietly confident we can give good results even in English conditions, he said.

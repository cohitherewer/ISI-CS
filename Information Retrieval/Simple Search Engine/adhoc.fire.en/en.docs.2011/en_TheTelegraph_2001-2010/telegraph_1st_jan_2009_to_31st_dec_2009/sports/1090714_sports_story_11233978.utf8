                                                   Jeevs pairing
                      
	Turnberry (Scotland): Jeev Milkha Singh was Monday drawn with multiple PGA tour winner Rory Sabbatini of South Africa and Anthony Wall of England for the first two rounds of the British Open starting here on Thursday.         
	Gaganjeet Bhullar, the only other Indian in the fray, will have Rhys Davies and James Driscoll for company. World No.1 Tiger Woods has drawn Lee Westwood and Ryo Ishikawa.         
	Woods has never played with the 17-year-old Ishikawa, who made history at 15 when he won on the Japan Golf Tour, the youngest winner on a sanctioned circuit.         
	They met briefly in Arizona at the Accenture Match Play Championship, captured by dozens of photographers.         
	Jeev has not been in the best form since returning from a rib injury and missed the cut at the Scottish Open last week.         
	Meanwhile, Woods had another look at Turnberry on Monday. Woods teed off on the Ailsa Course early in the morning and was finished as some players were just arriving. (PTI)

            A STAFF REPORTER            Rohan Banerjee after scoring a century against Hyderabad on Thursday.   A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Rohan Banerjee hit a marvellous 266-ball 111 as Bengal reached 299 for seven at the close of the second days play against Hyderabad in a CK Nayudu Trophy match at the Jadavpur University, Salt Lake campus ground, on Thursday.         
	Resuming at an overnight score of 80 for no loss, the hosts, on the slow and turning wicket, managed to add 219 runs on the day, as their opponents struggled to match them, in the early session.         
	Left-hander Rohan hit 14 boundaries in his innings and, along with Writam Porel, steadied Bengals innings and gave them a lead of 157 runs. Hyderabad were bundled out for 142 in their first innings.         
	Porel was trapped in front of the stumps by Lalit Mohan just after the right-hander reached his half-century. Sufian Khan, who retired hurt on Wednesday, returned and managed 62 before Sarvesh Kumar uprooted his stumps. And Sreevats Goswami (41), who looked promising during his 168-minute stay at the crease, hit seven boundaries, before being caught by PV Singh off Basheer.         
	Basheer, who in the third session of the match, bowled a perfect line and length, got the better of Sayan Sekhar Mondal (6) and Debapriya Ghosh (0) too.         
	At close, Soumya Pakre (18n..) and Amit Banerjee (0n..) were at the crease.         
	BRIEF SCORES:         
	Hyderabad 142. Bengal 299/7 (Rohan Banerjee 111, Sufian Khan 62; Basheer 3/43). Match to continue

                                                   Celebrated comebacks
                      
	Athletes strive, suffer and fight to reach the pinnacle, to be on top of their game. And after reaching the summit, some turn away from it all, go far from the madding crowd as it were. Sport goes on, new heroes appear. But once in a while, the return rewrites the script and captures the imagination. The comeback itself is never easy though. If there isnt the barrier of an ageing body, there is the cynicism of detractors. Then there are those for whom exile was not voluntary and the return was a triumph of the will.         
	If in his decision to come out of retirement Michael Schumacher needs inspiration, he can look to some illustrious people (who have returned after staying away for two years or more). Heres a look at some of them (alphabetically):               
	Muhammad Ali         
	When notified that he was eligible for the draft, in 1967, Ali refused to serve in the US Army for which the government prosecuted him and the boxing commissions took away his license. He was idle for three-and-a-half years at the peak of his career. Ali and Joe Frazier met in the ring on March 8, 1971, at the Madison Square Garden. The fight, known as The Fight of the Century, lived up to the hype. Although he lost Ali sure showed that he could still pack a punch.               
	Mohinder Amarnath         
	The Indian all-rounder is known as the comeback man of Indian cricket. During his two decades at the top, he was dropped on several occasions and every time he fought his way back with sterling performances. After his debut series, in 1969, he had to wait until 1975 to make it to the team.               
	Lance Armstrong         
	The Texan survived cancer to collect a record-breaking seven consecutive Tour de France titles, the last of which heralded his retirement from the sport in 2005. He announced last September he would return for another crack at the yellow jersey and finished third in this years tour.               
	Martina Hingis         
	Was just 22 when she announced her retirement in 2003. In 2005 she returned to competitive action, lost in the first round of a minor tournament and decided against a comeback. She had a change of heart once again a few months later but never reached her former glory and retired for good in 2007.               
	Michael Jordan         
	Arguably the greatest ever basketball player, he retired from the game in 1993. He announced, in 1995, his return to the Chicago Bulls with a statement that simply read Im back. Jordan inspired the Bulls to win the NBA finals and was named Finals MVP for a record fourth time.               
	Niki Lauda         
	The Austrian driver won the Formula One world championship for Ferrari in 1975 and 1977, but two years later quit motor racing. He returned with McLaren in 1982, and in 1984 landed his third world title before retiring again at the end of the 1985 season.               
	Bob Simpson         
	When Test cricket was hit by the breakaway World Series Cricket in 1977, Simpson, who had retired at the end of the 196768 season, made a comeback to captain New South Wales and Australia at the age of 41. His first assignment was a five-Test series against India. Simpson dazzled with the bat as Australia won the series 32. He became the oldest Australian to score a Test century on home soil before retiring at the age of 42.

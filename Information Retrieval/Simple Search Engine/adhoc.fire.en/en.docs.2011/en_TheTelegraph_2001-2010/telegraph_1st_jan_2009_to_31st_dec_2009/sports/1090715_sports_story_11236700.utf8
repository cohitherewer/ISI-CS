The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Falcon fancied on Day I
                                                                                                               Falcon fancied on Day I
            STAR RACER                                    
	Calcutta: Stage is set for, perhaps, the best ever monsoon season, which starts from Wednesday. The season was originally scheduled to begin from last Friday but it had to be delayed in view of the weather conditions which were hardly conducive for thoroughbred racing. Now that everything has fallen into place, more than 450 horses, lined up in the Hastings stables, will be out to test their hooves to go during the 23-day season, which may also have plenty to offer in terms of competition and entertainment.          
	It may pay to follow trainers Arti Doctor, Javed Khan and Harvinder S. Bath early in the season. Most of their runners are in forward condition and they may try to cash in on the advantage before the big guns decide to fire.          
	Artis Spirited Star, Pocket Rocket and Sparta are the ones who may deliver the goods in thier respective events. However, the trainers Queen Of Hearts may find a match in Lycia Falcon, from Rutherford Alfords yard, in the feature event, the 1,100m Alamito Cup. Lycia Falcon is known to produce best in his early starts. Jockey Md Islam partners the Royal Gladiator-Uranium son.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | John could wear England colours

  - 2009 ASHES CAMPAIGN       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            John Buchanan                                 
	Calcutta: Discussions are on between John Buchanan and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) on an arrangement which could see the Australian in the role of a consultant during the forthcoming Ashes, from July 8.         
	Clearly, he may emerge as the No.1 weapon in the hands of Andrew Strauss and Co.         
	That possibility is there, though Ive informed the ECB brass that a few sensitivities would, obviously, have to be taken care of, Buchanan, Australias hugely successful coach from late 1999 till early 2007, told The Telegraph.               
	No time frame has, however, been set.  
	Australia won three of the four Ashes campaigns during Buchanans tenure: In 2001 (England), 2002-03 and 2006-07. The only loss had been in 2005, in England. His Ashes-specific credentials  winning 14 of the 18 Tests  are truly awesome.         
	Till recently, Buchanan had been Cricket Australias coaching ambassador, but the one-year contract wasnt renewed. So, in a formal sense, there wont be any clash with his national body.

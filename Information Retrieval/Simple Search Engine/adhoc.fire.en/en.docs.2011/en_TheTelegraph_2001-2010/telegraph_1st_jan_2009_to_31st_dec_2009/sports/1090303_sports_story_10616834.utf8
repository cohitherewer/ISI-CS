	Johannesburg: Australia outplayed South Africa comprehensively to go 1-0 ahead in the three-Test series on Monday, and took an important step towards retaining the top ranking in the five-day game.         
	Australia completed the victory eight balls after tea when Mitchell Johnson bowled Dale Steyn for six. The victory margin was 162 runs with South Africa bowled out for 291 in their second innings, in pursuit of a target of 454 runs.         
	South Africa, who have won home series against India and the West Indies in recent years after going 0-1 behind, may find Australia a tougher proposition.         
	The top Test ranking is up for grabs in the current series, but South Africa must win both remaining Tests in order to overtake Australia in the series and the rankings.         
	The second Test in Durban starts on Friday, and the third, in Cape Town, on March 19.         
	South Africa had beaten the Aussies 2-1 in Australia in December and January, and expectations were high that they would also win at home.         
	Australia captain Ricky Ponting said his team, rated underdogs coming into the Wanderers Test, handled difficult conditions in the match well.         
	We rectified most of the errors we made in the home series this week, he added. I think we had the worst of the batting conditions, but it was a good team effort.         
	We went in without a spinner and left out Doug Bollinger Those selections have been justified. We have won the last two Tests against South Africa. This team is bouncing back.         
	Proteas captain Graeme Smith did not readily concede that his side was under-prepared for the first Test, with critics suggesting that the teams bowlers had not had match practice heading into the match.         
	Instead he gave Australia credit for playing better at key moments of the encounter.         
	In the first couple of days we got too far behind 466 was too much for Australia in the first innings, Smith said.         
	Smith also praised Ponting, Johnson and Marcus North, who scored a century on debut, for playing key roles in the Australia victory.         
	Australia played three debutants in all, and the Proteas captain said they would be looking at tactical options against them ahead of the second Test.         
	Meanwhile, South Africas selectors have included all-rounder Albie Morkel in the squad for the remaining two Tests against Australia following an injury to pace bowler Lonwabo Tsotsobe. Tsotsobe has a cartilage tear in his right knee that needs surgery and he could be out for up to three months.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saina loses her way
                                                     Saina loses her way
            JAYDEEP BASU            Saina in Hyderabad on Friday. (PTI)                           
	Hyderabad: Indian interest in the $120,000 Yonex Sunrise Indian Open badminton diminished considerably after crowd favourite Saina Nehwal crashed out of the womens singles quarter finals at the Gachibowli Indoor Stadium Friday.         
	Backed by a vociferous crowd, that cheered loudly every time the local girl earned a point, Saina, seeded second, committed a series of unforced errors to go down to Julia Pei Xian Wong of Malaysia 21-12, 13-21, 18-21.         
	I started off well but made too many mistakes, admitted a visibly disappointed Saina minutes after her loss to the never-say-die Malaysian in the hour-long encounter. But for those mistakes, I could have turned the match my way.         
	Saina wasnt far from the truth. She played an array of impressive strokes in the first game only to fritter away the advantage in the next two. In both games, she geared up pretty late, allowing her opponent to gain the initial lead.         
	She was using her smashes very effectively, Saina said. Perhaps I was low on stamina.         
	It was Sainas apparent lack of consistency that put paid to her hopes. Wong was a dogged combatant and fought for every point. Well aware of the Indians class, Wong was determined to attack from the beginning. The strategy paid off as Saina lost her way after the first game.         
	While the Indian was struggling to get back her rhythm, Wong calmly stuck to her basics to walk away with the match.         
	The Indian hopes now solely rest in the doubles sections where they made to the semi-finals of the mixed doubles and the womens doubles. In both events local girl Jwala Gupta played stellar roles and dished out impressive display to make the semi-finals.         
	In the mixed doubles, the second seed pair of Jwala Gupta and Diju Valiyaveetil made short work of Tao Jiaming and Xiaoli Wang of China to win 21-13, 21-13.         
	In womens doubles, Jwala paired up with Shruti Kurian to beat Chiou Hwee Haw (Malaysia) and Yujia Lee (Singapore) 21-19, 21-16.         
	In the mens quarter finals, former world champion and the star attraction of the meet, Taufik Hidayat (Indonesia) had to fight hard before beating Beng Hong Kuan (Malaysia) 17-21, 21-17, 21-19.

	Wellington: Jesse Ryder, New Zealands No.1 Test batsman in the ICC rankings, has attributed his good form to inputs from John Wright, the former captain and coach of India.         
	Andy Moles has been a great support for me, just let me play my game. John Wright is another one whos been helping me with my batting, hes always in my ear, Play straight, play straight every ball and thats what Ive been trying to focus on while Ive been batting. Its been working for me, said Ryder. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Villa, Llorente sink South Africa
                                                   Villa, Llorente sink South Africa
                      
	Bloemfontein: European champions Spain set a world record of 15 successive international wins by beating South Africa 2-0 in the Confederations Cup on Saturday.         
	David Villas goal seven minutes into the second half and another 20 minutes later from substitute Fernando Llorente also meant Spain equalled Brazils run of 35 matches without defeat.         
	Runners-up South Africa joined Group A winners Spain in the semi-finals after Iraq drew 0-0 with New Zealand in Johannesburg, the home players waiting anxiously in a huddle on the pitch before discovering their fate. Villas goal was a masterclass in control and finishing as he chested down a chip from Alvaro Arbeloa before turning and shooting wide of Itumeleng Khune.         
	The keeper had brought the crowd to its feet less than a minute earlier, stopping the Valencia players penalty and a follow-up shot from Carles Puyol. The kick had been awarded after Villa was brought down by Aaron Mokoena.

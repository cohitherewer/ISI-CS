The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Robin ends Rafaels reign
                                                   Robin ends Rafaels reign
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Paris: Rafael Nadal, the Spanish king of clay, slumped to his first-ever defeat here Sunday, in one of the greatest upsets in the tournaments history. The loss came after 31 wins in 31 outings since his 2005 debut.         
	Swede Robin Soderlings stunning victory came just a month after he had won only one game in a 6-1, 6-0 rout at the Rome Masters, his third defeat in three matches against the world No 1.         
	But Soderling was a transformed man on Sunday, unleashing a formidable service game and a relentless, pinpoint accurate forehand, which forced Nadal to constantly scramble for a foothold in the match.         
	Nadals first-set loss was the first time he had dropped a set in the tournament since the 2007 final against Roger Federer.         
	The Spaniard was reeling from the outset at the hands of a man whom he had accused of being one of the most unpopular players in the locker room after an acrimonious Wimbledon clash two years ago.         
	Nadal was broken in the fourth game as the 23rd seed went 4-1 ahead and again in the crucial eighth, as the free-flowing, uninhibited Swede continued to find the corners with devastating accuracy. The 24-year-old deservedly claimed the opening set when the champion netted a backhand.         
	Nadal, despite missing his usual fluency and rattled by the unrelenting assault, broke for the first time to lead 2-1 in the second set only to surrender his advantage in the 10th game. With most people inside Court Philippe Chatrier expecting a Nadal drive to fly past the big Swede, Soderling executed a fine backhand volley to go to 5-5.         
	Despite those heroics, Nadal ran away with the tie-breaker to level the match when, for once, Soderlings forehand missed its target and flew long.         
	The Swede, coached by compatriot and 2000 finalist Magnus Norman, refused to yield, breaking to lead 4-3 before backing it up for a 5-3 advantage in the third set. He took the set when Nadal netted another weary forehand off yet another deep Soderling drive.         
	Nadal broke to lead 2-0 in the fourth set, but Soderling hit back immediately as another tie-break loomed where the gallant Swede clinched his famous win on a second match point when Nadal went wide with a pickup.         
	His reward is a match-up with Russian 10th seed Nikolay Davydenko, who beat Spanish sensation Fernando Verdasco, the eighth-seed, 6-2, 6-2, 6-4.         
	Sundays drama would have delighted Roger Federer, who has lost the last three finals to Nadal, and who still needs a French Open to complete a career Grand Slam.         
	He plays his last-16 tie on Monday against Germanys Tommy Haas.         
	Earlier in the day, Chilean Fernando Gonzalez and Briton Andy Murray reached the last-16 stage beating Victor Hanescu and Marin Cilic respectively. While Gonzalez won 6-2, 6-4, 6-2, Murray won 7-5, 7-6 (7-4), 6-1.         
	With Novak Djokovic and Nadal out, Murray and Federer are the favourites left in the draw now.

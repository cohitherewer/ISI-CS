	I am a left-handed batsman. I always try to score runs off each and every ball, and as a result, get out quickly. How can I shun this habit?         
	(Somnath Dey, 21, Guwahati)         
	Concentrate on your strengths and work on your shot selection.         
	I am a right-handed batsman and am very uncomfortable against balls aimed at the rib cage. Please help.         
	(Nihang Rongphar, 17, Guwahati)         
	Try and get back and across and use the depth of the crease when playing of the backfoot.         
	I am a right hander and often fail to get my timing right when attempting the cut. As a result I get caught in the gully/point region. Please help.         
	(Soham Dey, 19, Calcutta)         
	Make sure your weight goes into the shot when attempting it.         
	What is the right way to play the bouncer?         
	(Rishabh Chauhan, 15, Calcutta)         
	Watch the ball at all times. And do not take your eyes of the ball. It will help you make the necessary adjustments.         
	I struggle against the yorker and often get bowled. Please help.         
	(Somnath Dey, 21, Guwahati)         
	Watch your backlift.         
	I am a right-arm pacer. How does one keep the shine on the ball for a long time?         
	(Ayan Banerjee, 21, Calcutta-30)         
	Its important that not just you but your teammates too look after the ball.         
	I often get nervous while fielding, and as a result, give away runs through misfields. Please help.         
	(Arijit Ghosh , 13, Durgapur)         
	Get your body behind the ball and dont take your eyes off it. Practice a lot and start enjoying it.         
	I am 17, 5 ft 4 inches and 53 kg. Should I use a heavy, medium or light weight bat?         
	(Sougata Saha, Calcutta)         
	Any weight you are comfortable with so that it doesnt hamper your stroke play.         
	I fail to control the new ball when trying to bowl fast. Please help.         
	(Suman Sikdar, 17, Calcutta)         
	Make sure you are balanced at the time of delivery and your head doesnt fall away.         
	I am a left-arm spinner. Whenever I take a diagonal run-up for bowling round the wicket, I end up bowling a no ball. How can I overcome this problem?         
	(Rakesh Sharma, 24, Calcutta)         
	Work on your run up. There is no harm in marking a run up that allows you to bowl from 6 inches behind the popping crease.

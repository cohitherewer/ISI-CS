The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 4-1 victory for India
                                                                                                                                   4-1 victory for India
                      
	New Delhi: Out of contention for a next round berth, India s-cored a consolation 4-1 win over Afghanistan in their AFC U-19 Championship qualifiers Group C match at Arbil, Iraq.         
	India had lost to Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Oman in their earlier group matches. They play Kuwait in their last group match on November 15.         
	Interestingly, India, who squandered their lead in the last two matches, were trailing 0-1 at the half time before making a strong comeback in the second session at the Francouse Hareeri Stadium Thursday night.         
	Malsawmfela (48th and 72nd) and Jeje Lalpeklua (60th and 80th) scored for India.         
	The first half was dominated by India but it was Afghanistan who scored in the 20th minute against the run of play from the only good move they made in the first half. (PTI)

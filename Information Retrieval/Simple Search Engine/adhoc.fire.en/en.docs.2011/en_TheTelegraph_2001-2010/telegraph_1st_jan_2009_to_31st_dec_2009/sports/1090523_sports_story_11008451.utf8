The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mendis is out of key panel
                                                     Mendis is out of key panel
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Duleep Mendis                           
	Calcutta: Chief executive Duleep Mendiss sidelining within Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has gone a step further: Hes been dropped as one of his countrys nominees on the 2011 World Cup organising committee.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources in Colombo, Mendiss place has been taken by SLC secretary Nishantha Ranatunga, younger brother of Arjuna.         
	Nishantha, in fact, was brought into SLC to clip Mendiss wings. After all, you dont really need a secretary when you already have a chief executive.         
	That Operation Sideline Mendis would be initiated had become rather obvious once Somachandra de Silva became SLC chairman earlier this year.         
	Mendis (a former captain) and De Silva, one-time teammates, havent been seeing eye to eye for years.         
	Incidentally, Mendiss contract with SLC is till the end of this year.

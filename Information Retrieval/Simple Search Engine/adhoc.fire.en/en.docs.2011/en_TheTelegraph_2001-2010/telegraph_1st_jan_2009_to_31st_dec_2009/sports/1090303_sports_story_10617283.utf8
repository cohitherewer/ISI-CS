The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians may bounce back: Vettori
                                                   Indians may bounce back: Vettori
            A CORRESPONDENT                                  
	Napier: Captain Daniel Vettori sounded a word of caution for his team on Monday and said that the Indians have the capability to bounce back pretty quickly. The New Zealand captain stressed on the importance of maintaining presuure on the Indians.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On the probable Indian resurgence         
	The Indian team comes out and plays with freedom and once they get on a roll, then they are difficult to stop. At the moment, the roll is with us; we just got to make sure that we keep it going and keep putting them under some pressure because they have so many good players, so many good stroke-makers that they can take it away from us very quickly. We are wary of their ability to bounce back pretty quickly.         
	On Sachins presence         
	He brings in a wealth of experience. He has been to New Zealand on a number of occasions. He understands the conditions. He is arguably one of the best batsmen ever to have played the game. As soon as you put him in the side, it definitely makes a difference.         
	If he wins the toss on Tuesday         
	I dont think the lights are all that good here, so it will be interesting. The wicket looks fantastic again... We would love to have a bat and put the runs on board.

  - Delhi Daredevils garner only 98 as sehwag, gambhir fail to fire         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Gautam Gambhir is bowled by Shane Harwood (not in picture) at the Kotla on Friday. (PTI)                                 
	New Delhi: All the talk about adaptability and home advantage proved immaterial in the end as Australias Victoria Bushrangers inflicted a humiliating seven-wicket defeat on the Delhi DareDevils in their Champions League T20 at the Kotla Friday.         
	Watched by a good number of spectators, who thronged the ground late in the evening expecting fireworks from Virender Sehwag and company, DareDevils played as if they were batting on this pitch for the first time. So poor was the display that the local side could not even reach the three-figure mark. This despite having seven Test players in their ranks.         
	With the DareDevils scoring just 98 for eight from their 20 overs, Victoria had little difficulty in reaching the target, which they did in 16.4 overs.         
	The DareDevils downfall was scripted by some impressive bowling by Man of the Match pacer Clint McKay and Peter Siddle. Backed by some superb fielding, the two bowlers bowled accurately to keep the Delhi batsmen under check. McKay especially, with venom in his pace, had the batsman under a lot of discomfort.         
	Poor shot selection also cost the DareDevils dear. They still could have recovered had Sehwag stayed longer. The dashing opener, making a comeback after a shoulder surgery, looked solid in his innings of 21 that was studded with four fine boundaries but he fell to a great return catch by McKay. The Aussie took the catch inches off the ground on the follow through.         
	Gautam Gambhir, on the other hand, was bowled by a Shane Harwood delivery that kept low. The two captains of the days first match between the New South Wales Blues and Diamond Eagles had described the pitch as low and slow. The DareDevils skipper learnt it the hard way.         
	All said and done, the visitors had a more professional approach. We have been playing together for more than two years now. We have gelled well as a team, Brad Hodge had remarked a day before the start of the tournament. On Friday, it became evident how right he was.         
	Things were no better for the Delhi franchise when they came out to bowl. Victoria opener Rob Quiney batted aggressively to strike 40 off 33 deliveries, which was enough to take the match away from the local side.         
	The introduction of leg-spinner Amit Mishra did not prove fruitful immediately, with Quiney going on the offensive from the start.         
	Mishra was dispatched for a six over long-on off in his very first over and the second and third deliveries of his next over disappeared for ten runs. He, though, struck next ball bowling Quiney.

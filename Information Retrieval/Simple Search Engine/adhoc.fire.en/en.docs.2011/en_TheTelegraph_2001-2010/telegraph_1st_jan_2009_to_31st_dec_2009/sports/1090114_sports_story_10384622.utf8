The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tevez should leave, says Maradona 
                                                   Tevez should leave, says Maradona 
                            
	Milan: Argentina coach Diego Maradona has said Carlos Tevez should think of leaving Manchester United for Serie A title holders Inter Milan.         
	The 24-year-old Argentine forwards future with the English and European champions is in doubt with his current deal due to expire at the end of the season.         
	Yesterday (Sunday) I saw Manchester United win (3-0 against Chelsea) without Tevez. This isnt good for him, Maradona was quoted as saying by Corriere dello Sport on Tuesday.         
	Certain episodes are certainly bringing closer his exit. Italy and Inter in particular would be excellent solutions.         
	Whats more, his contract is running out, which makes it easier to change team.         
	Maradona, who is in Italy to watch Inters Italian Cup tie against Genoa at the San Siro later on Tuesday, said Atletico Madrids Argentine striker Sergio Aguero should also consider a move to Inter.         
	What advice would I give him? To come running to Inter. I can already imagine the extraordinary partnership hed form with (Zlatan) Ibrahimovic.           (REUTERS)

	Orlando: Tiger Woods, the worlds top golfer, was slapped with a traffic ticket for careless driving on Tuesday, four days after driving his Cadillac SUV into a fire hydrant and a tree outside his Florida home.         
	No allegations of domestic violence were levelled against Woods, a powerhouse marketer and perhaps the worlds richest athlete with a fortune estimated at $1 billion, and the investigation into his accident last Friday has been closed, the Florida Highway Patrol said.         
	The investigation has determined that Mr Woods is at fault in the crash, FHP major Cindy Williams told a news conference in Orlando.         
	Williams said no criminal charges would be filed against Woods.         
	He could be fined up to $164 and points against his drivers license.         
	Woods has declined to speak to police about the accident, leaving questions about the circumstances of the accident  in the early hours of Friday  unanswered.         
	There are no claims of domestic violence by any individual, FHP sergeant Kim Montes said.           (REUTERS)

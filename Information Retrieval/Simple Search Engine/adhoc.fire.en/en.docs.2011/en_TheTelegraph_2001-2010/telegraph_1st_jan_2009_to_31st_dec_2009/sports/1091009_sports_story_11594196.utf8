                                                   NSW look to prey on Eagles
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: A formidable New South Wales Blues, led by Simon Katich, will take on the Diamond Eagles of South Africa in a Group B encounter of the Champions League T20 at the Kotla on Friday.         
	With players like Katich, Brett Lee, Stuart Clark, Nathan Hauritz and David Warner in their ranks, the Australians are one of the strongest contenders for the title.         
	We have a great T20 side, who are capable of even beating an international team. Given the form of our players, we should be able to win the title, Lee said.         
	On the contrary, the Eagles consist of relatively unknown players, except their captain Boeta Dippenaar, a former South African international.         
	All-rounder Morne van Wyk will also play a key role for the South African team.

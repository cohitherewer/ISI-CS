                                                   East Bengal stocktaking
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal began their dissection of pathetic performances in the IFA Shield as the club executive committee met on Monday. Football secretary Santosh Bhattacharya was endowed with the responsibility to talk with coach Subhas Bhowmick and the players to detect the problem areas and iron them out.         
	The coach will be attending the core committee meeting on Tuesday.         
	We would want to know his views on the matter, a club official said.         
	Meanwhile, the red and gold brigade are hopeful that Ghanaian Yusuf Yakubu and Lebanese Rameez Dayubs papers will be cleared before the forthcoming Durand Cup.

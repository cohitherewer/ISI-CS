	London/Buenos Aires/Bangkok: Peter Crouch will get his first chance to shine as a starter under coach Fabio Capello when England go for a fifth straight World Cup qualifying win on Saturday against Ukraine.         
	The Portsmouth striker, who has only played under the Italian coach as a substitute, will start at Wembley after England were hit by injuries to three other strikers, Emile Heskey, Carlton Cole and Darren Bent.         
	Capello also called up Gabriel Agbonlahor, even though he has scored only once in his last 16 games for Aston Villa. Rooney will be playing behind Crouch.         
	England are hoping to build on their big lead at the top of Group Six and push one of their main group rivals out of contention. The English have a five-point advantage over both Ukraine and Croatia, who should collect a routine victory over last-place Andorra.         
	Rooney will become the youngest player to reach 50 England appearances when he lines up against Ukraine. Rio Ferdinand also trained Tuesday and hopes to shake off a groin injury to play alongside John Terry in central defence. Ukraine are expected to have Andriy Shevchenko partnering Hertha Berlin striker Andriy Voronin in attack.         
	France will be relieved to be back on home turf against Lithuania on Wednesday having played three of four matches in their stuttering World Cup qualifying campaign on the road, captain Thierry Henry said.         
	France lie third in Group Seven with seven points, behind Serbia with 12 and Lithuania nine, and can claim second spot with another victory over the Baltic nation in Paris following Saturdays 1-0 success in Kaunas.         
	European champions Spain, who beat Turkey 1-0 in Madrid on Saturday, have five wins from five ahead of Wednesdays Group Five match in Istanbul and are now unbeaten in 30 stretching back to November 2006.         
	England and the Netherlands are the other teams with 100 per cent records.         
	Germany travel to Cardiff to face Wales with a four-point lead over second-placed Russia in Group Four.         
	In South America, Uruguay will try to halt Marcelo Bielsas impressive revival of Chile when the two sides meet in the South American World Cup qualifiers on Wednesday.         
	Diego Maradonas Argentina visit Bolivia at 3,600 metres above sea level and Brazil need a convincing win at home to Peru.         
	With seven rounds of matches left in the 18-match campaign, Paraguay lead with 23 points followed by Argentina and Chile on 19 and Brazil 18. The top four qualify for the 2010 finals in South Africa.         
	In Asia, old rivalries on and off the field will reignite on Wednesday when qualification reaches its most critical stage in Asia.         
	In Group One, a win for Australia against Uzbekistan and a draw between fierce rivals Bahrain and Qatar will send the Socceroos through to South Africa with two games remaining, but it is the battle for playoff berths that is providing the most intrigue.         
	Japan lead on 11 points and look almost certain to advance automatically with Australia, leaving Bahrain, Qatar and Uzbekistan  all level on four points  gearing up for a thrilling dogfight for third place and a playoff spot.

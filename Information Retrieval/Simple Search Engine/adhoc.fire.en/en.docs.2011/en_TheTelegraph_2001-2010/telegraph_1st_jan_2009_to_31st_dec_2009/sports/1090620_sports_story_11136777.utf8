                                                   Theres never any pressure on me, says Lasith Malinga
    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  Spearhead is indebted to Sri Lankas President             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              Lasith Malinga      
	London: Today, there are few bowlers in international cricket who can match quick Lasith Malinga in terms of impact. The 25-year old, who is such a key member of the Sri Lanka team, recently spoke to The Telegraph.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q You had a long layoff and, though you played a T20 International against India in February, the IPL was your real comeback. Did you expect to make such an impact (18 wickets for the Mumbai Indians) straightaway?         
	A Well, I wanted to achieve what the franchise wanted from me... Im happy that I could do my bit... Id been off competitive cricket for a year (from after the 2007-08 tri-series in Australia).         
	Whats your approach?         
	(Grins) Try and get a wicket on every ball... Thats what I aim for, even though I know thats not really possible... Having done my best gives satisfaction.         
	Didnt you play a domestic T20 tournament before the IPL?         
	A few matches...         
	What exactly happened to your right knee, making you miss so much cricket?         
	A bone got bruised... The Board sent me to Australia, but Dr David Youngs treatment didnt work... I struggled till December or so, when our President (Mahinda Rajapaksa) called me and introduced me to his personal physician, who cured me after only five days of treatment... The months of pain and frustration went away and Ill remain grateful to our President.         
	Its unusual for a countrys President to introduce a sportsman to his personal physician...         
	The President was concerned that I wasnt playing and thats why hed called me to his residence... When I gave the reason, he asked me not to worry... Its a gesture I cant forget.         
	Did medication for those five days alone do the trick?         
	The pain went away, but leg-strengthening exercises had to be done... Gradually, I started running and, then, bowling... It was such a relief when I had nets after a year.         
	What did you do in the period that you were forced off cricket?         
	Consoled myself by saying Id run into a bad period... In fact, there was a time when I thought I wouldnt be able to resume playing... Thanks to the President, I could recover and make a comeback which people are talking about.         
	Did you, perhaps, watch videos of old performances?         
	To lift my morale, yes... I did... I also watched live matches on the TV... So, in some ways, I was in regular touch with the game.         
	Is the unusual action your USP?         
	Dont know... I just follow my personal coach Champaka Ramanayakes advice to bowl fast and straight... I enjoy bowling when the ball begins to reverse.         
	How crucial is the pace you bowl at?         
	Pace is important because Ive been picked as a fast bowler... Bowling at 120-130 kmph wont be of any use to the team... Ive got to be there at over 140.         
	You idolised Waqar Younis. Why?         
	He could do unusual things with the old ball and that quality left me fascinated.         
	Just how seriously did you take the IPL matches?         
	I was serious, but they were like club-level fixtures... I wasnt under pressure, just tried to do my job  get wickets.         
	You must surely be under pressure when you play for Sri Lanka...         
	Theres never any pressure on me, after all, I have the ball in my hands.         
	Looking back, would you pick those four wickets in four balls (a record) against South Africa, in the 2007 World Cup, as your No. 1 performance?         
	That remains special, but the one which gave most satisfaction was four for 44 during an ODI against England in Leeds, three years ago.         
	Why are you not so enthusiastic about that four in four?         
	Because we lost that match (in Georgetown)... Wed won in Leeds, though.         
	How do you prepare for a series or a tournament?         
	I focus on myself, my strengths and dont worry about the reputation of the opposition batsmen... I plan the way Id like to bowl in a particular match. The preparation is all in the mind.         
	Despite your success, is there room for improvement?         
	(Laughs) Of course Ive got to improve.         
	There are many seniors in the Sri Lanka dressing room. Whats the environment like?         
	Good... Ive found everybody very supportive... Its a nice blend of seniors and the younger players.         
	Do you follow other sport?         
	Like watching Ronaldinho...         
	How do you unwind?         
	Well, I watch wrestling on the TV... Find it a nice way of relaxing.         
	The final one: What are your immediate goals?         
	To make a difference in the World T20 (he began the semi-final with 11 wickets to his credit) and to take 100 Test wickets... Im nine short.

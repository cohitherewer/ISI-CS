                                                   James rues missed chances
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Wellington: New Zealand pacer James Franklin on Friday rued that Indias batsmen got away after being reduced to 204 for six on the first day of the third and final Test at the Basin Reserve here.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The opening days play         
	We have probably given away 50-60 runs too many. Again they got away with few lucky shots, and the balls didnt go to hand So thats how life can be at times Yeah the tail wagged. Probably 320-330 would have been a fair reflection of the day for us, but you know Harbhajan played his luck and got away with it, and so did Zaheer.         
	The Indian late-orders resistance         
	The short balls seem to work against the tail we probably didnt bowl enough stuff up. Sure the guys will reflect on the last half an hour and hour, and come back harder and get that last wicket.         
	If the teams are evenly balanced at the end of Day I         
	Yeah. Its probably balanced at the moment. We have got nine wickets in a day, and as I said, they have probably scored 50 or 60 runs too many. As long as we can get that wicket quickly Saturday morning, its a matter of batting for a day and a half or two days.         
	The movement of the ball         
	A little bit of swing... There hasnt been much over the last two Tests. This ground has always been good for swing bowling. That was the case today.         
	His bowling         
	I feel I have been bowling reasonably well over the last two Tests, but havent been getting any wickets. Cricket can be a funny game. On days when you are bowling well, you dont get rewarded for it; and at times you dont bowl so well and get wickets. Felt good with my game coming into this game, and I feel I bowled all right.         
	The wicket         
	I think its a pretty good batting wicket. We took a bit of punt today with the toss, we probably would have bowled better first, but we know we need to win this game. I mean if we bat we want to get as many as we can so 400-450-500.

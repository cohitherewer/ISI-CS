	Barely hours before they were to report in New Delhi for the national camp, the India players belonging to the two city majors faced uncertainty over their participation after their clubs warned them of a salary cut were they to go ahead and join the squad.         
	To find a solution to the impasse, the IFA secretary Utpal Ganguli has called East Bengal and Mohun Bagan to a meeting on Tuesday morning.         
	East Bengals Syed Rahim Nabi and Mehrajuddin Wadoo and Mohun Bagan players Deepak Mondal, N.S. Manju, N. Mohanraj and Rakesh Masih have been selected for the camp but till Monday evening it wasnt clear whether they would be able to take part in the training that is to be held over two legs in Dubai and then Barcelona from June 25 to July 7.         
	The players are supposed to report to the All India Football Federation (AIFF) by noon on Tuesday.         
	I called up one official on Monday. He told me clearly that I would have to forgo my salary for the days I am at the camp I dont know what to do , a player told The Telegraph.         
	Bhaichung Bhutia on the other hand faces no such hurdle as he is technically a free player.         
	Yes, I will be going This is a matter between the club and the federation The players are only to play, Bhaichung said.         
	Meanwhile, the AIFF was kept waiting Monday by the ministry of sports which is yet to release the funds for the tour. Frustrated by the delay, the AIFF booked tickets on its own and applied for the team visa at the Spanish embassy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We will beat Real, says Ibrahimovic
                                                                                                                       7                                      We will beat Real, says Ibrahimovic
                      
	Madrid: Zlatan Ibrahimovic believes Barcelonas world-class talent will lead the Spanish champion to a el clasico victory over Real Madrid on Sunday, in what the Sweden striker has labelled the biggest game of the year in football.         
	Madrid hold a one-point lead in the standings going into one of the most eagerly anticipated derbies between the archrivals, especially after Madrid spent over $375 million on players in the summer.         
	Ibrahimovic said in a recent interview that he was pretty sure we will beat them despite Madrids additions of Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka, Karim Benzema and Xabi Alonso.         
	It will be a very exciting game, a very interesting game. I think it will be the game of the year, not only in Spain but worldwide, Ibrahimovic said. Im not worried because I know Barcelona is a stronger team. We have players at each position that are world class.         
	Although Ibrahimovic hasnt played in over three weeks because of the hamstring problem, he left little doubt about whether he would be available at the Camp Nou come Sunday.         
	You want to play these big games These big games remain in the history, of course, the 28-year-old said, before adding a pinch of perspective. But they are not the games that make you the champions. People dont think about that, (but) its the small games that make you the champions. You win the big games, but if you dont win the small ones you wont be champions.         
	This is certainly no small game.         
	With squads that have an estimated combined value of 1 billion Euro, a global audience will be following a match that will be covered by more than 700 hundred accredited media representatives from 22 countries. The match will also be showed in cinemas across the country for the first time.It seems like the perfect backdrop to exhibit the teams contrasting styles.

                                                     Tie vs NZ turning point: Jhulan
            A STAFF REPORTER            Jhulan                           
	Calcutta: Captain Jhulan Goswami has held poor fielding and running between the wickets responsible for Indias mediocre performance at the recently concluded Womens World Cup in Australia. The Indians finished third.         
	I feel we lacked in two aspects of the game. Our fielding and running between the wickets needed improvement. While the fielding was not up to our usual standards, the running between the wickets was pretty slow, the 25-year old Jhulan told The Telegraph on Tuesday.         
	Asked to explain what went wrong after a good start, Jhulan said that an off-day against the Black Caps proved to be the turning point. India lost to New Zealand by five wickets in that match.         
	We had a good start there. But the match against New Zealand was a bad game. We fielded very badly and failed altogether as a team  That was the turning point, she said.         
	Talking about her team, which had two debutants  Harmanpreet Kaur and Poonam Raut  Jhulan said: We had a new team altogether. But we were confident We started as underdogs but failed to deliver at a crucial time. But believe me this team will one day change many equations.         
	On her regaining the No. 1 spot in the ICC ODI player rankings, she said: It is only a ranking for me... I would be happy if we had won the World Cup Gaining the No. 1 position is only a mark for me. It helps me understand my standard compared to others. I dont play for records but I play for my country. Jhulan bagged four wickets in seven matches in the World Cup.         
	According to Jhulan, England deserved to be the champions. They have been playing very good cricket for the last three/four years They were outstanding throughout the tournament and I feel they played like champions. They deserve to be the champions.

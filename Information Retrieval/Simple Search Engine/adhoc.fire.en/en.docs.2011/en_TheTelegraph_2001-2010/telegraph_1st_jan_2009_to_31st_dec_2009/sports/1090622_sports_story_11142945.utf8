	I will ask the state government to go into these allegations. The fact is that they did this when I was out of the country. It shows their real intentions. This is nothing but a mudslinging campaign, the former Andhra Pradesh cricketer said.

On the allegations of harassment of some women players, Chamundeshwaranath asked: Has any woman player said that? There is a separate selection committee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Muniyappa is at tied third spot
                                                     Muniyappa is at tied third spot
                  Adam Blyth, the first round leader, in action on Thursday                     
	Gurgaon: C Muniyappa became the unlikely hero after most of his illustrious compatriots took a tumble and the Bangalore pro brought home six-under 66 to lie tied third and two strokes off leader Adam Blyth after the opening round of the Indian Open here on Thursday.         
	His rising stature notwithstanding, Gaganjeet Bhullar carded a modest one-over 73, as did last years Indian Masters champion SSP Chowrasia and in Arjun Atwals (75) case, the rust showed as the Orlando-based Indian continued his quest for top form since coming off shoulder injury.         
	Australian Adam Blyth fired eight birdies in a flawless display at DLF Golf and Country Club for a one stroke lead over Korean Lee Sung.         
	Indian-born Swede Daniel Chopra, South African Keith Horne and Unho Park from Australia all carded 67s to share the fifth place.         
	New Zealands Michael Campbell, the 2005 US Open champion, also disappointed, shooting 76.         
	One-under after a modest front nine, Muniyappa struck gold on his way back, dropping just one bogey while firing four birdies besides the 15th hole eagle.         
	The Indian trio of Digvijay Singh, Arjun Singh and Harinder Gupta also got off to a strong start, sharing the eighth place at four-under 68.         
	They were followed from one shot behind by Raju Ali, Rahul Ganapathy and Arshdeep Tiwana at tied 12th.         
	Veteran Gaurav Ghei, Vinod Kumar, Harmeet Kahlon, Amandeep Johl, Shamim Khan and Rashid Khan were in the 22nd place huddle after carding matching 70s.         
	Former cricketer Kapil Dev did not do too badly considering his amateur status and the cricket legend returned 77.           (PTI)

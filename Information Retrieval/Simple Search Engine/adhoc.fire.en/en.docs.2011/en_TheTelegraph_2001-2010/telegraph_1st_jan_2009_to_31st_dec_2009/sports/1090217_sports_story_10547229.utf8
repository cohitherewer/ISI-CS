                                                     Johnson clinches PGA title

	Pebble Beach (California): American Dustin Johnson clinched his second PGA Tour title on Monday when the final round of the weather-hit Pebble Beach National Pro-Am was washed out by rain.         
	No play was possible on Sunday because of heavy rain and strong winds on the Pebble Beach Golf Links and organisers abandoned play on Monday morning with the course under water.         
	It was the first PGA Tour event decided after 54 holes since American Phil Mickelson won the 2005 BellSouth Classic.         
	The 68-man field had been scheduled to tee off at 0730 local on Monday but, after start times had been pushed back by an hour, the tournament was finally called off.         
	Johnson, who had led Canadian Mike Weir by four shots after surging ahead of the pack by firing a five-under-par 67 on Saturday, was automatically handed his second PGA Tour title.

                                                   Dysons maths fails WI
                      
	Georgetown: England won the opening one-day International by one run by virtue of the Duckworth-Lewis method on Friday, following a horrible mathematical miscalculation by West Indies coach John Dyson.         
	Paul Collingwood and Owais Shah helped England set West Indies 271 for victory.         
	The match was heading for a thrilling finish in fading light, when Stuart Broad trapped Denesh Ramdin lbw to leave West Indies on 244 for seven from 46.2 overs and put England ahead on the D/L chart. Dyson misread the numbers and called-in his batsmen with West Indies two behind the required victory target.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Taibu effort goes in vain
                                                                                                                                   Taibu effort goes in vain
                      
	Benoni: South Africa cruised to a 45-run victory over Zimbabwe Sunday in a one-day international designed to dust away cobwebs ahead of a tour by England that begins in five days.         
	A patient 80 from Hashim Amla spearheaded the Proteas to 295 for five off 50 overs at Willowmoore Park where scorching morning heat gave way to rain and a 40-minute delay before the game drifted to an inevitable conclusion.         
	Reeling at 48 for five, Zimbabwe staged a magnificent recovery thanks to a record 188-run partnership against South Africa between wicketkeeper Tatenda Taibu (103 not out) and Stuart Matsikenyeri (86) and they were 250 for six by the close.         
	Man of the Match Taibu was unbeaten on 103.           (AFP)

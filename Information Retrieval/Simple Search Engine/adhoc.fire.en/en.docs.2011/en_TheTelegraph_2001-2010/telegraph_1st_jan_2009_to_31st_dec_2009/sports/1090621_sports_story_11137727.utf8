                                                     Im in good form and want to keep going, says Dilshan

	London: Chris Gayle and Kumar Sangakkara paid rich tributes to Sri Lankas prolific batsman Tillekaratne Dilshan, saying the right-handers sublime knock made all the difference in Fridays second semi-final of the World Twenty20.         
	Dilshans unbeaten 96 off 57 balls helped Sri Lanka survive a mid-innings collapse and post 158 for five.         
	Im running out of superlatives. I think the total we got was quite a big one, but we owe everything to Dilshan, Sri Lanka captain Sangakkara gushed.         
	He has been an excellent stroke-maker in this World Twenty20. The best thing for us has been that over the last one and half years, he has come to understand his role in the side and has become more responsible and mature. Finally, he has come to understand how good he is, Sangakkara said.         
	His West Indian counterpart Gayle too had no qualms in admitting that Dilshans knock took the game away.         
	We did not bowl badly but Dilshan took the game away with that magnificent innings.         
	He was the only Sri Lankan among the runs. In this format, one man can change the match and he did it today (Friday), Gayle said.         
	Gayle admitted his side were undone by Angelo Mathews.         
	I expected him to open the bowling because hes been doing it in the last couple of matches, Gayle said.         
	But we kept losing wickets and it was downhill from there.         
	Dilshan, on his part, said the idea was to stay till the end.         
	Once I got the start, I wanted to keep going until the end. Im in good form over the last six months and I want to keep going, said the batsman who was the obvious choice for the Man of the Match award on Friday.         
	The ball was not coming on to the bat and it did not look a typical Oval wicket. But it proved the perfect pitch for us as we put up a good total and turned screw on.         
	Sangakkara said all he wanted was to deny West Indies a flying start and keep them on a leash in the Powerplay.         
	I knew if we get first six overs pretty well, we have (Ajantha) Mendis and (Muttiah) Muralidharan to bank on, he said.         
	Speaking on Mendis, he said: I think he has already won enough games for us to be a match-winner, in Twenty20 and in all forms of cricket. He has been an absolute charm for us.         
	Sangakkara also took the opportunity to remind his teammates that their job in the tournament is not over yet.         
	Hopefully we can continue the good work in the final. For the final against Pakistan, we can take a lot of self-belief and confidence from this game.         
	The idea would be to concentrate on the role we have and the basics.         
	This philosophy has taken us this far and we need to be responsible on Sunday too and execute our plans, he added.           (PTI)

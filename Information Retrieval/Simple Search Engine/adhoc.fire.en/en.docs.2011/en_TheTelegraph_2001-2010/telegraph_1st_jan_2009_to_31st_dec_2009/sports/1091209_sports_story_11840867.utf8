The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Whatmore makes the first move
                                                                                                                       7                                        Whatmore makes the first move
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Dav Whatmore with The Telegraph Schools Chess champion Sayantan Das, at Gorky Sadan, on Tuesday. The event was presented by Himani Sona Chandi Chawayanprash. A Telegraph picture                             
	Calcutta: Its not for nothing that Dav Whatmores man management skills have always come in for acclaim.         
	In keeping with his image, then, Whatmore went to the Taj President (in Mumbai) on Monday morning, the day after the India-Sri Lanka Test series got over. He had a one-point agenda: To say hello to Ajantha Mendis and Angelo Mathews.         
	As a bonus, the Kolkata Knight Riderss coach also got to meet Ishant Sharma, a key member of the franchise whose principal owner is Shah Rukh Khan.         
	I didnt know both teams were in the same hotel, so I wasnt prepared to meet Ishant... As it turned out, I spoke to him very briefly... Said wed do better next season and that he would do better, too, Whatmore told The Telegraph on Tuesday.         
	Ishant is, of course, low on confidence after being dropped for the last two Tests of the just-ended series. Hes also not in the squad for the first two ODIs.         
	Whatmore couldnt have an extended chat with the two Sri Lankan Knights as well. Quite a few of the other players joined in... (Kumar) Sangakkara, Mahela (Jayawardene), (Muttiah) Muralidharan, (Tillekaratne) Dilshan... Everyone had something to say...         
	He added: Murali, as usual, spoke the most... I couldnt follow everything, but he did ask whether Id quit smoking. I had to tell him that I gave it up three-and-a-half years ago...         
	According to Whatmore, who coached Sri Lanka twice, including when the World Cup was won in 1996, the Sangakkaras didnt exactly look down and out after the thrashing at the hands of India.         
	Im sure theyre feeling it, within, but that didnt show up on their faces... I expect India to carry forward the momentum gained in the Test series, but a good win early on (when the T20 Internationals and ODIs get under way), could change things for Sri Lanka, Whatmore pointed out.         
	Complimenting Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. for achieving the No.1 ranking in Tests, Whatmore said: Its disappointing that Indias playing so few Tests (a mere five in 2009 and just two in the next nine months or so)... They need to play more to be able to maintain the top position and consolidate...         
	Meanwhile, the Knights have traded Moises Henriques with Owais Shah (Delhi DareDevils) in the build up to IPL III, next year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fourth Berlin victory for Gebrselassie
                                                   Fourth Berlin victory for Gebrselassie
                      
	Berlin: Haile Gebrselassie won the Berlin Marathon for the fourth straight time Sunday despite struggling in the last third of the race.         
	The Ethiopian star was on world record pace in the first 30 km. But once his last pace maker dropped out, Gebrselassie noticeably slowed down and was gritting his teeth by the time he approached the finish line under the Brandenburg Gate in sunny weather.         
	It wasnt marathon weather, Gebrselassie said. It was too warm in the last 10 km. At the beginning it was perfect. I could have tried to push maybe, but really its wonderful. I am OK.         
	Gebrselassie set world records in winning on his favourite course the last two years, but this time he finished well over in 2 hours, 6 minutes and 8 seconds.         
	Last year, Gebrselassie became the first man to run under 2 hours, 4 minutes when he finished in 2:03:59 and slashed 27 seconds off his previous mark. He is the only man to win the Berlin Marathon four times.         
	Francis Kiprop of Kenya was second in 2:07:04 and Negari Therfa of Ethiopia was third in 2:07:41. (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dravid: NZ tour is not tough 
                                                   Dravid: NZ tour is not tough 
                      
	New Delhi: Team Indias Test record in New Zealand is dismal at best with not a single series win in the past 41 years, but veteran batsman Rahul Dravid says he still does not consider it a tough country to tour.         
	I dont think its particularly difficult (to play in New Zealand). I have always enjoyed touring there.         
	Everyone is basing their assumptions on the last tour (in 2002-03), but it was probably an aberration, Dravid said, referring to the 0-2 defeat the Indians suffered six years ago.         
	Dravid, part of only the Test team, will travel to New Zealand when the three-match Test series is played after the two Twenty20 matches and a five-match ODI series.         
	Recalling his Black Caps sojourn six years ago, Dravid refused to blame the hostile conditions for the teams poor show, saying that Indians simply did not play good cricket.         
	The wickets were very good, both in Test matches and one-dayers. The wickets were actually fantastic: good to bat on, something in them for bowlers as well, Dravid said.

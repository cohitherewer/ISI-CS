                                                   Players left over safety issues: BWF
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hyderabad: The Badminton World Federation (BWF) Thursday cleared the air over the sudden withdrawal of the two Austrian doubles players from the World Championships.         
	The players, Peter Zauner and Juergen Koch, decided to withdraw because they did not feel secure about the security arrangements what with the Independence Day and Englands withdrawal, said BWF COO Thomas Lund on Thursday. They stated that they had taken advice from the embassy and the ministry of foreign affairs.         
	BWF is not aware of any official warning or assessment of higher threat levels from the Austrian embassy. The BWF obviously regrets the decision the players took but accepts this judgement from each of the players. The Austrian team has not been attending any of the managers meetings. However, one coach and a player are still here, Lund, added.         
	This is an unusual start to the World Championships but its not our job to convince players to stay.

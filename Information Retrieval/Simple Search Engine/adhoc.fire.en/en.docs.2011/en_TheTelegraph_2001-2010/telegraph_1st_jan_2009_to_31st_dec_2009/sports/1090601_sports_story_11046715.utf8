The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India have the edge: Vettori
                                                   India have the edge: Vettori
                      
	London: New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori feels that India, with more Twenty20 games under their belt, have a slight edge over the other teams in the ICC World T20 Cup beginning on June 5.         
	You have to look at India. First and foremost they have probably played the most Twenty20 cricket in terms of individuals and the guys have gone ahead playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL), Vettori said at the official press conference here on Sunday.         
	However, the Black Caps captain is also not ready to undermine the other teams.         
	Sri Lanka will be dangerous with their bowling as (Muttiah) Muralidharan, (Lasith) Malinga and (Ajantha) Mendis will be tough to score off.         
	Then there is Australia and South Africa They also have a very formidable line up, Vettori added.         
	His Pakistani counterpart Younis Khan said he was confident of winning the trophy this time but even a final four finish would give a boost to cricket in his country.         
	Im confident that Ill take the trophy to Pakistan. Even if we dont win, it will be an achievement for us to finish in the top four, he said.         
	Winning the tournament will be great impetus for our cricket. If we play good cricket it will be good for our nation. These days our country is depressed. Only cricket will start cheering the people, he added.         
	Younis felt it was not necessary for the top order batsmen to go for big shots right from the start of the innings.         
	T20 looks short, but its not  120 balls is enough. If you bat normally but with energy, 180-190 is gettable.         
	In English conditions, the new ball does seam, so you need someone like Salman Butt who can play for 20 overs. But in the middle order, we have big hitters like Shahid Afridi and Misbah-ul Haq.         
	Speaking on the 2007 final defeat to India, Younis said: We could not finish off the match when we needed only five runs. But it was fantastic to be a part of that team. Some guys were crying at the end, but hopefully, well have the finishing touches this time, Younis said.         
	Khan said opener Salman Butt and middle order Misbah-ul Haq have niggling injuries but should recover in time for the first game at the Oval against England on June 7.         
	West Indies captain Chris Gayle said his side has the wherewithal to emerge winners despite going into the tournament on the back of defeats to England in the recent Test and ODI series.         
	Any team can win. We are confident we can win. It wont be easy but we are looking forward to it, he said.         
	His first priority though is to get into the second stage by qualifying from the tough group which also has Australia and Sri Lanka.           (PTI)

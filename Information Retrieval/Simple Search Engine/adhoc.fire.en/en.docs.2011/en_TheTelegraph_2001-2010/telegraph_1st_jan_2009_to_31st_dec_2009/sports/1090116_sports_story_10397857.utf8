	Calcutta: Ace marksman Abhinav Bindra, who needs no introduction really, spoke to The Telegraph for at least half-an-hour on Thursday afternoon. The suave 26-year-old was, well, forthcoming.               
	The following are excerpts:         
	Q Five months after the Olympic gold, how much has life changed?         
	A (Grins) In a way a lot, in a way not at all... Im still exactly the same person... The values I cherish are still the same... If theres any change at all, then its mental... For 15 years, my goal had been to win an Olympic gold and, during that period, I didnt think of a millimetre beyond the medal... I went about it in extreme fashion... That gold had been my only focus and, so, in a sense Ive actually been left without a goal after Beijing!         
	How would you describe this phase?         
	One of transit... From one phase to another... Im not sure what Ill now be passionate about... Im trying to see what my future could be like... Im not sure of the next goal... However, Ive just started to dream again and thats good.         
	Are you completely off shooting?         
	Ive resumed training and I trained for 40 hours last week... Initially, I wanted a longer break, but couldnt keep myself away from the range for too long... I like the process of shooting... Of trying to improve each day... I like training... Before a fresh goal, it was important that I get into it again... The goals will come by themselves, I suppose, over a period of time. As Ive told you earlier, 2009 isnt an important year in terms of competitions, so its ideal as a period of transition for me.         
	Given that you are both world and Olympic champion in the 10m air rifle, could there be something more challenging to achieve?         
	Well, Im fulfilled... The atmosphere that I grew up in, though, was one of complete negativity... Getting an individual Olympic gold was seen as almost unachievable... Fifteen years ago, had somebody said Id win an Olympic gold, then Id have replied that I wouldnt want anything more... Today, in a sense, Im starting afresh and Im doing so because I like the process.         
	Moving away from sport, whats the biggest challenge for India?         
	Good question... Security, I guess... The end-November terror strikes in Mumbai were the ones most talked about, but 2008 saw terrorist attacks in many major cities... So many lives got lost... Security, therefore, is a very big issue... Im not an expert and Im not part of decision-making, but I suppose war with Pakistan isnt an option because both countries are nuclear... Even if it is, it has to be the last option... Im sure war would have broken out, post-Mumbai, had India and Pakistan only had conventional weapons...         
	How do we quickly get our security act right?         
	Again, Im no expert, but we definitely need to be in a position to prevent terror strikes... We look at the US and at Israel and marvel at the level of security there, but why not have something similar in India? Id like the world to look at our country and marvel at our internal security... We should be the best and thats a challenge for every Indian... (After a pause) Having been glued to the TV during the Mumbai operations, I must say I was quite disappointed to see some of the weaponry at the disposal of our forces... In fact, the lack of modern weapons was shocking.         
	Realistically, is there a quick-fix solution?         
	No... As in getting to do well in sport, a process has to be followed, but we should be moving forward instead of wasting too much time introspecting on what could have been done... The process may be slow, but you need to start and the country needs to have a vision... Have a vision and work towards that... Im sure people in positions of responsibility are doing what theyre supposed to do.         
	There was fear all over after the terrorists struck in Mumbai. How did you react?         
	There was fear, of course... For some days after that, I stayed away from hotels... Not because of fear, but because going to a hotel wouldnt have given me good vibes... Its scary that while were talking (at The Park coffee shop), this afternoon, something could have happened         
	Are we, as a nation, soft?         
	Generally, we Indians are soft... We accept things more easily... We forgive more easily... Thats our mindset, our approach... Some aspects should change, certainly in sport... No point being gentlemen losers! You arent in competition to make friends, youre there to beat the other individual or the other team... You cant be happy losing, youve got to be aggressive... Got to be a go-getter... You can either try to win or try and be friends, not both, Im afraid.         
	Whats the other big challenge?         
	(Grins) Id say sport... If were looking to be a developed nation by 2020, then we cant just win two-three medals in the Olympics... Look at China, its first gold was in 1984, yet its such a powerhouse in this century... Sport, for me, is an integral part of nation building. It could be a hard task, but weve got to collectively work towards improving the standard... New Delhi is hosting the 2010 Commonwealth Games, but the improvement in infrastructure there wont benefit anybody outside the capital... Theres talk of bidding for the Olympics, but Id be much happier if the money which would go into hosting an edition is spent on developing infrastructure across the country... There should be many small centres of excellence, giving sportsmen and women the chance to improve their skills and, in doing so, getting noticed. Vision is needed in sport as well... Youve got to dream too... Dream big... At the moment, theres recession globally, but weve been dreaming big in business and in other areas. Why not in sport?         
	Could you, at some point, act as mentor to sportspersons with Olympic aspirations?         
	Not sure that Im qualified to act as one but, yes, Im there to help anybody who wishes to learn from my experience. What Id like to emphasise is that theres no set way to success... Theres no formula as such and youve got to be flexible... Clearly, one has to find his or her own path... Find his or her own road to success... Its not necessary that everybody has to follow what I did, they can pick up what helps them and try and pick up the good from others as well... Take the positives out of everybody.         
	Your message for youngsters?         
	Never ever give up, never... Most of my career has seen failures, not big successes... Youve got to keep trying and youll either succeed or youll try again... I dont think failure should leave you very disappointed or bring morale down... Failure is the stepping stone to success. Indeed, when you win, theres not much that you can take out of it... Its from failures that you learn.         
	The last one: Your thoughts on having shared the stage with fellow-icons Viswanathan Anand and Sourav Ganguly?         
	It was an honour... Anand and I spoke about Dortmund He plays there and Ive trained there... As for Sourav, Ive been a fan of his... As captain, he changed the face of Indian cricket... Injected aggression... Wed been a soft team till then... Sourav took our cricket forward and the change in attitude brought about by him will, Im sure, last forever.

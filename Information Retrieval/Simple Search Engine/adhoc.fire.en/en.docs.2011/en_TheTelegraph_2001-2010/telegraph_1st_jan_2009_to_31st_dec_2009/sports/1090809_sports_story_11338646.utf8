            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Indias campaign in the forthcoming Nehru Cup suffered a setback even before it started when striker Sunil Chetri was ruled out of the tournament.         
	According to the strikers father, Kharga Chetri, the ace goal scorer has little chance of donning the national jersey in the Nehru Cup. Sunils injury is not very serious but doctors have advised him complete rest at the moment, he said.         
	Although Bob Houghton is yet to announce the squad for the Nehru Cup, Sushil Singh is likely to replace Chetri.

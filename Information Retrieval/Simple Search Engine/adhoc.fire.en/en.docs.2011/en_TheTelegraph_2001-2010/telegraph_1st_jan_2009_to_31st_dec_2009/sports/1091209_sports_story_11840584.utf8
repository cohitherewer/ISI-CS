	I am focusing on the world championship as it is an important challenge ahead. Once the venue is fixed, the focus should remain only on the chessboard, he told reporters at the sidelines of the National Womens Chess championship here.         
	He refused to divulge any strategy he would deploy against Topalov. He said he is also planning to play in the Corus Chess Championship in January.         
	On the World Cup in progress in Russia, he felt that the Indian players were a shade unlucky not to progress beyond the second round.         
	Praising the youngsters who brought laurels to the country in the game, Anand made a special mention of Soumya Swaminathan who won the World Junior Girls Championship and also MSP Sethuraman, who is the current World Under 16 Champion.         
	With the new crop of youngsters like Abhijeet Gupta, S P Sethuraman, Vidit Santhosh Gujarathi and Harika coming up, the gap at the top will narrow down soon and India will be a big force to reckon with in chess, felt Anand.         
	Anand is expected to begin preparations from next month. (PTI)

	Mumbai: Odafa Okolie stamped his class once again with two scintillating goals to lead Churchill Brothers to a comprehensive 3-1 win over Mahindra United in an I-League clash here Saturday.         
	Odafa first set up teammate Felix Chimaokwu with a sublime pass for the opening goal in the 33rd minute and the latter returned the favour by feeding him in the 63rd minute for the second. The Nigerian scored another goal in the 82nd minute.

            THE ICCS PITCH CONSULTANT ANDY ATKINSON CHECKS OUT THE TURF AT THE EDEN ON FRIDAY. A TELEGRAPH PICTUREA STAFF REPORTER              The ICC rsquo;s pitch consultant Andy Atkinson checks out the turf at the   Eden on Friday. A Telegraph picture                      
	Calcutta: Tim May was part of Allan Borders team that won the 1987 World Cup at Eden Gardens. The chief executive of the Federation of International Cricketers Association, who is in the city as a member of the International Cricket Council (ICC)s delegation to review arrangements for the 2011 World Cup, spoke to The Telegraph on Friday.               
	The following are excerpts               
	If the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Champions League T20 should be a part of the Future Tours Programme (FTP)         
	This decision has to be made by the ICC. Naturally the IPL and the Champions League have had an impact on the players. The Champions League came across very well and a majority of the countries were involved. Its sensible to have a window in the FTP. Its an important tournament and a great opportunity for the domestic players who dont get to showcase their talent on the international stage. The problem now is that theres too much of international cricket The landscape has changed with the advent of T20 and cricket hasnt adapted well to it yet.         
	Ricky Pontings view that the Champions League hampered Australias preparations for the current ODI series         
	Its not just about the Champions League Cricket in general has become very difficult on the players. If you look at the schedule in international cricket, its become harsh on the players.         
	One of the feedbacks that we receive is that it is becoming very difficult for the players to continue with such packed schedules away from their homes and families. To earn more is not necessarily better They want to play more international cricket but the wear and tear is ruining them. The game will be best served if we can reduce this.         
	If money was luring players into playing for franchises         
	If you ask a player the priority will be to play international cricket. But, yes, there is a change in the landscape.         
	We need to have a change in the international calendar accordingly. If the international calendar was taking the desire out of the players, we should try and avoid any such situation         
	His suggestion for cricket boards         
	The cricket boards will always want to maintain revenue. From a players perspective, we need less of international cricket to retain them at the international level for a longer period. We need to find the right solution where the volume of cricket will be lesser. The answer lies in the context of Test and one-day cricket At the end of the day, bilateral one-day series doesnt mean anything         
	If Test cricket will survive, what with the advent of T20         
	I think people are jumping the gun unnecessarily. I dont think Test cricket will die But if you let Test cricket die, it will die We need to have the best players for Test cricket. We need to maintain a balance to allow those players to play Tests. The present FTP is pushing the players out of international cricket.         
	On the Indian players decision not to sign the Wada code         
	Were not privy to the discussions that took place between the ICC, the BCCI, the players and Wada. So it would be irresponsible for me to make a comment.         
	Whether he favours the whereabouts clause         
	I feel the whereabouts clause is very taxing on the players... There can, however, be arguments for both sides.         
	Memories of the 1987 World Cup final at the Eden         
	I didnt have much to do I bowled four odd overs and was pretty much a passenger. Anyway, it was good fun to be part of the World Cup winning squad.

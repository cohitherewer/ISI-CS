	Farmingdale (New York): Ricky Barnes set the US Open 36-hole scoring record Saturday by finishing two trips around Bethpage Black in 8-under 132.         
	Tiger Woods, meanwhile, was trying to fight his way into contention as rain returned to still-soggy Bethpage Black.         
	Indian golfer Jeev Milkha Singh will need more than brilliant play and probably a prayer, too, as he gets off to the second round in search of a berth into the final two rounds. Placed at 11-over after 24 holes, he was certain to miss the cut.         
	Barnes completed his second round on Saturday morning, making three birdies in nine holes for a 65.         
	The previous 36-hole record was 133, set by Jim Furyk and Vijay Singh at Olympia Fields in 2003. Barring someone in the second half of the draw going on a birdie barrage, Barnes was almost certain to be the midway leader.         
	Its pretty cool, Barnes said. Obviously at the beginning of the week you didnt think that score was out there. Obviously with some tees moved up and the soft greens helped it out. And obviously with my ball-striking was the most probably impressive part of the first 36 holes. Obviously.         
	Barnes has hit 31 of 36 greens this week; the rest of the field is only hitting the green in regulation about half the time.         
	Barnes led Lucas Glover by one shot; Glover had a chance at matching the US Open and all-time Major championship record with a 20-foot birdie putt on his final hole Saturday morning, only to leave it short and settle for a bogey-free 64.         
	First-round leader Mike Weir, who has finished in the top 20 at the US Open seven of the past nine years, was two shots off Barnes lead at 6 under. A threesome of players, including David Duval, were tied for fourth at 3 under through 36 holes.         
	Woods was nowhere in sight on the leaderboard. The defending champion and worlds No. 1 finally got to start his second round Saturday, after slogging his way to a 74 in his opening 18 holes. Woods lost four strokes in the final four holes he played Friday morning, completing his opening round before sunshine arrived and conditions improved a bit at Bethpage Black.         
	By the time Woods got back on the course, he was 12 shots behind Barnes and likely needed a score somewhere around par to reach the third round  whenever it gets played. Through 13 holes on Saturday, Woods was 2 under for the day, 2 over for the week. The projected cut was 4 over.         
	Woods round began under bright sunshine. It didnt last. More rain was predicted to start falling sometime around midday on Saturday, with up to 1 inch possible according to the National Weather Service.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis fit for NZ series
                                                     Younis fit for NZ series
                  Younis                     
	Karachi: Pakistan captain Younis Khan on Monday cleared doubts over his availability for next months one-day series against New Zealand in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.         
	However, Younis has refused to return to Twenty20 cricket even though Pakistan will play two Twenty20 matches against New Zealand, saying Shahid Afridi will lead the side in the shortest format of the game.         
	I am available for the series. I am okay, there is no doubt over my fitness. I will be meeting the PCB chairman this week to discuss the coming series as well as the performances in the Champions Trophy, Younis said.         
	The senior batsman had been recovering from a hairline fracture in his finger suffered during the Champions Trophy in South Africa.         
	YounIs said his finger was fine and he was enjoying a few days break from cricket.         
	I will be playing in the next round of the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy for Habib Bank. And I will hopefully clear any doubts anyone has about my fitness, YounIs said.         
	The senior batsman also made it clear he had no intentions of leaving captaincy in Tests or ODIs and was satisfied with the progress of the team. I am eyeing the 2011 World Cup, so there is no question of not wanting to remain as captain, Younis said.         
	I myself was disappointed with my form but it happens to any player and I am confident that I will be back scoring runs soon. I am one of those people who believe that captain must perform himself to lead by example and I have always done that, he said.         
	Meanwhile, PCB chairman Ejaz Butt, Younis and coach Intikhab Alam will appear before the National Assemblys standing committee on sports Tuesday to respond to the match-fixing allegations labelled against them during the Champions Trophy.

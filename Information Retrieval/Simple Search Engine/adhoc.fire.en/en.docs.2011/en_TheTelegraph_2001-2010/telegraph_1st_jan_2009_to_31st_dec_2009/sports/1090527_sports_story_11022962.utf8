The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | All eyes fixed on Rome 
                                                   All eyes fixed on Rome 
    - Manchester United, Barcelona meet for European Footballs holy grail                                     Rome: For all the talk of their devastating attacking capabilities, Barcelona and Manchester United must sort out defensive worries for Wednesdays Champions League final.         
	As the teams and hordes of fans arrive in Rome for the 67,000 sell-out, Barca coach Josep Guardiola has much to ponder.         
	The Spanish champions will be without three of their first choice back-line for the clash at the Stadio Olimpico, with fullbacks Daniel Alves and Eric Abidal suspended while central defender Rafael Marquez misses out through injury.         
	Guardiola, in his first year in charge, may opt to shift midfielder Seydou Keita to left back ahead of Silvinho, with Yaya Toure continuing to fill in at centre back and captain Carles Puyol possibly shifting to the right.         
	The silky skills of Uniteds Cristiano Ronaldo and Barcas Lionel Messi have led fans to label the game the dream final.         
	However, United midfielder Michael Carrick is aware last seasons semi-final between the pair was far from pretty, with the English side prevailing 1-0 in the second leg at Old Trafford. We thought it would be very open and attacking when we played them last season and in the end there was only one goal over two legs, Carrick said.         
	They can score and create chances at any time but we believe we can defend well and attack them.         
	Carricks comments suggest United may be prepared for another smash-and-grab raid, where they nullify Barcas attacks and hit them on the counterattack. The plan worked to perfection in the semi-final demolition of Arsenal, where world player of the year Ronaldo scored one of the goals of the season in a quick break from Uniteds own box.         
	Meanwhile, Rio Ferdinand has declared himself fit for Wednesdays Champions League final against Barcelona. The England centre back has been troubled by a calf problem and sat out Sundays 1-0 Premier League win at Hull City despite manager Alex Ferguson saying he wanted him to prove his fitness.         
	The injury is fine, Ive been training for the last couple of days with the team and I feel good, he told a news conference on Tuesday.         
	I wouldnt start the game if I wasnt 100 per cent fit. I wouldnt do that to the team. I dont see any problems from training for two or three days.         
	The 30-year-old was immense in helping United to the trophy last season, especially in their rearguard action away to Barcelona in the semi-finals. That 0-0 draw was followed by a 1-0 home win by United but Ferdinand wants his side to attack on Wednesday rather than starting on the back foot in a one-off final.         
	Defending so deep against such talented players can be dangerous. But we are capable of doing both. That is the strength we have as a squad and a team, he said.                   
	Barcas inspirational playmaker Lionel Messi has often been quiet against English opposition and Ferdinand is confident Uniteds defence can subdue the Argentine again.         
	It will be difficult whoever plays against him, he is a fantastic player with great control but weve done it before, he added.         
	Fergusons team will become the first to seal back-to-back European Cups in the Champions League era if they win on Wednesday. Ferdinand, though, was nonplussed by the possible milestone.         
	We just want to win it and you guys can determine our place in history. We just want to win the competition we are in and theres a big one tomorrow (Wednesday), he said ahead of his team taking their final training session on Romes Stadio Olimpico pitch.         
	The Catalans say they are not interested in Uniteds tactics and want to show off their full array of talent, which failed to shine in their fortunate semi-final victory over Chelsea.         
	Since I dont know what sort of game theyll play, what we have to do is get hold of the ball, dominate midfield and attack, midfielder Xavi told a news conference before jetting into Italys capital.         
	Winning means we have to impose our own style. The boss has told us to play the way we have all season, to enjoy ourselves and go for it from the off. He also reminded us that we need to control our nerves and emotions.         
	And while United and Barcelona play for the Champions League trophy, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi may well be squaring off for the right to call himself the worlds best player.         
	Ronaldo, however, doesnt seem too concerned about that.         
	Now to decide (who the best player is), who cares about that? What I want more is to win the Champions League and thats it, Ronaldo said Tuesday from the Stadio Olimpico. I respect Barcelona very much, Messi is special also... Sincerely, Im not worried about that. I would rather win the Champions League final. I want it very much.         
	Ronaldo is the reigning Fifa world player of the year after his 42 goals last season guided United to both the Premier League and Champions League trophies. Messi was second in the voting, despite Barcelona enduring a second straight season without a trophy.         
	This season, however, Messi has already collected two trophies and netted more goals than Ronaldo, and the result of Wednesdays final could be the deciding factor when votes are cast for next years award.         
	Thierry Henry and midfielder Andres Iniesta are both expected to play after training normally following knocks. Rome police will begin a huge security operation later with a partial alcohol ban in force in some areas of the city. Trouble has marred United visits to play AS Roma in recent years.

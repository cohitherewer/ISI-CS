The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rest keep up the momentum
                                                   Rest keep up the momentum
                      
	Nagpur: Openers Abhinav Mukund (86) and Murali Vijay (77) struck unbeaten half-centuries for Rest of India (RoI) to end Day III in a commanding position at 171 for no loss in the Irani Trophy Saturday.         
	With bad light ending proceedings early, RoI have taken an overall lead of 201 with all wickets intact.         
	Mukund and Vijay batted together for 55 overs after RoI bowlers polished off the Mumbai tailenders in no time, taking just 6.5 overs to see the opposition off for 230 in the morning.         
	Resuming at 200 for six, Mumbai could add just 30 runs, losing four wickets to hand a 30-run first innings lead to RoI.         
	Munaf Patel added two more wickets to Fridays three to complete his five-for, while Sreesanth dismissed two more to end with 3/46.         
	Mukund, sent in to open instead of skipper Virender Sehwag, and Vijay did not let their bowlers fine effort go to waste by playing sensibly.         
	But Mukund did survive a few chances.         
	He was dropped off Kulkarni when he pushed a length delivery that straightened from round the stumps to first slip where Sahil Kukreja failed to snaffle it.         
	He also edged a couple of wide deliveries from the unimpressive Rahil Sheikh, whose selection ahead of Saurabh Netravalkar seems just as odd in hindsight as it did prior to the game, but settled down soon to push RoI to a healthy position.         
	Vijay was the more aggressive of the two and his 146-ball 77 included 10 hits to the fence. Mukund had six fours in his 184-ball innings of 86.         
	It will now be a huge task for Mumbai to avoid defeat as RoI have two days remaining with all wickets in hand.         
	With the likes of explosive Sehwag, S. Badrinath, Ravindra Jadeja and Manoj Tiwary to come to bat, Rest of India would look to pile a huge lead before asking Mumbai to bat again.         
	Sreesanth removed overnight wicket-keeper batsman Vinayak Samant with the fourth ball of his first over and the days second, which also broke the 42-run stand for the seventh wicket with Ramesh Powar.         
	In the next over, Patel bowled Powar who made a defiant 83-ball 27.         
	Dhawal Kulkarni made a last-ditch effort to erase his sides first innings deficit with some lusty blows before eventually falling to Sreesanth, which included five hits to the fence.         
	Iqbal Abdullah (5) was the last Mumbai batsman to fall, Patel taking his wicket.           (AGENCIES)

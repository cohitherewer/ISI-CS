	Chennai: Star-studded Goa were held to a goalless draw by a gritty Karnataka while last years runners-up Services beat Maharashtra by a solitary goal in the group B quarter final matches of the 63rd National Football Championship for Santosh Trophy here Wednesday.         
	In a fast-paced match, the Goans had the majority of scoring chances but their forwards lacked the finishing touch. Such was Goas domination that the Karnataka frontline too had to fall back to defend their citadel on a number of occasions.         
	The first 15 minutes of play belonged to Karnataka whose forward B. Prakash missed the target by a whisker in the very first minute.         
	Captain Xavier Vijaykumar, despite being marked closely by Covan Lawrence, showed good athleticism and twice broke free in the Goa box only to hit wide on both occasions.         
	The Goans almost scored in the 48th minute. Following a pass from the left, substitute Francis Fernandes dodged two defenders and sent a powerful right footer which Karnataka keeper Gumpe Rime spilled. As Marcus Mascarenhas was about to latch on to the ball, B.V. Pradeep intercepted the ball but Nicholas Rodriguess shot was cleared by Prakash to safety. The second saw fewer attempts on goal from either side as Karnataka held on for a point.         
	Earlier in the day, Services managed to hold on to their first-half penalty by Laldingliana to prevail over Maharashtra and top the group with three points.         
	Maharashtra defender Anas Mohammed Kuttys attempt to block Services captain Shaji DSilva inside the box resulted in the penalty and Laldingliana calmly converted in the 11th minute.

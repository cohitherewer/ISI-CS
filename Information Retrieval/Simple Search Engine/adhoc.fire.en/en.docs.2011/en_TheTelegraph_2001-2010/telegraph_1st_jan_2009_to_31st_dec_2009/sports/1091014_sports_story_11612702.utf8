  - Victoria advance with better run rate; Sussex lose humdinger         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Michael Yardy of Sussex Sharks is bowled during the match against Diamond Eagles at the Kotla on Tuesday. (PTI)                                 
	New Delhi: In a pulsating Group B match of the Airtel Champions League T20, South Africas Diamond Eagles edged past Sussex Sharks of England in the Super Over to qualify for the Super Eight stage, at the Kotla on Tuesday. New South Wales Blues are the other team to qualify from this group.         
	After both teams finished on 119, the Super Over too saw some dramatic moments. Eagles batted first and scored nine runs with Man of the Match Rilee Rossouw alone accounting for eight. His partner Ryan McLaren scored just one.         
	In reply, the Englishmen looked clueless as medium pacer CJ de Villiers bowled Dwayne Smith and Rory Hamilton-Brown off the first two balls to turn the match in the favour of the South Africans.         
	It was a pity the Eagles had to wait till the Super Over to win a match they should have easily won in the stipulated overs. Chasing 119 for seven, the Eagles were sailing smoothly towards victory before leg-spinner Piyush Chawla bowled with guile to stop the South Africans in their tracks. Chawla, who captured two wickets, bowled tightly to give away just 17 runs in his four overs.         
	Giving him company was Sussex captain Michael Yardy, who, too, kept the batsmen on a tight leash with his left-arm spin. The two bowlers should be credited for keeping the rivals under check despite some big hitting by the Eagles opener Rossouw, who launched a blistering attack on the bowlers from the word go.         
	So dominating was Rossouws innings that the South Africans could have gone through easily had his partners ably supported him. While Rossouw, who scored 65 off 62 balls with seven fours and two sixes, scored freely at one end, the other Eagles batsmen could hardly get going on a slow pitch. Rossouws sixes were towering         
	Meanwhile, the Delhi DareDevils have already qualified for the second stage and will play the Royal Challengers Bangalore in Bangalore on October 17. They will then face the Cape Cobras at the Kotla on October 19.

	John Buchanan has talked of the following players as potential leaders of the Kolkata Knight Riders. Here are their pen pictures:         
	Chris Gayle: The tall and imposing West Indies captain is a hard-hitting left-handed opening batsman with a wide range of shots. He can also bowl right-arm off-spin. He currently holds the record for the highest score (117) in a T20 International, and, to date is the only batsman to have hit a century in this format. Gayles $800,000 price-tag made him one of Knight Riders most expensive players. However, a groin injury meant he was unable to play in the inaugural edition of the tournament.         
	Brendon McCullum: The New Zealand wicketkeeper-batsman is an explosive opener in the limited-over formats of the game. The Indian Premier League franchise Kolkata Knight Riders bought the Black Caps vice-captain in 2008 for $700,000, the highest for a New Zealand cricketer. He launched the tournament with an unbeaten 158 against Royal Challengers Bangalore.         
	Brad Hodge: The 35-year old Australian cricketer is a right-handed middle-order batsman, as well as a part time right-arm off-spinner. He has played eight T20 Internationals. He became the first to score a century in Australian domestic T20, scoring 106 off 54 deliveries for Victoria against New South Wales in 2006. He had a disappointing IPL in 2008 when he scored only 12 runs in three matches.         
	Laxmi Ratan Shukla: The Bengal captain bats right-handed and is also a useful medium-pacer. He has played three ODIs for India. The all-rounder has a knack for lusty hitting and bats down the order. Shukla was a useful contributor for the KKR in the inaugural IPL. He scored 163 runs at an average of 20.37 and picked up six wickets in 13 matches.

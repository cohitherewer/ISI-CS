The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Time time-wasting row ended, says Ponting
                                                   Time time-wasting row ended, says Ponting
                      
	London: A day before the start of the second Ashes Test, the time-wasting row from the finale of the first match refuses to die down with Ricky Ponting rejoining the fray on Wednesday, this time, however, to say hed had enough of it.         
	I have been a bit blown away by all the fuss over my comments on Englands physio and 12th man in Cardiff, Ponting wrote in an English daily.         
	As I tried to explain that (Sunday) night, I was disappointed when they came back out on to the field for a second time, but it had no bearing on the game. Now it seems as if were all talking about that one little incident, when weve just witnessed one of the great climaxes to a Test match.         
	Its all done and dusted, it was over within a couple of minutes, and the players have all moved on.         
	England sent on their 12th man twice in two overs as well as their physio as tailenders James Anderson and Monty Panesar held out for a draw.         
	Captain Andrew Strauss said it was merely to convey messages to the batsmen and that there had been no time wasting. Ponting, using the classic Australian put-down, described it as pretty ordinary.         
	Former England coach Duncan Fletcher took issue with that and wrote in Wednesdays Guardian: Ponting has to be careful. Someone needs to sit down and ask him what he understands by the spirit of the game. The way he plays is definitely not in the spirit.         
	Ponting described Fletcher as a very irrelevant person in my life and probably in the cricket world at the moment.         
	In recent years our record of players being reported or stepping over the line in international cricket has probably been as good as anyones.         
	Others were not so keen to let the tourists off the hook and, among them, significantly, was England team director Andy Flower.         
	Flower criticised Ponting for making a meal of the alleged time-wasting tactics and reiterated that the hosts played the game in the right spirit.         
	Steve Waugh, however, said: I think the physio and the 12th man were a bit embarrassed about what happened. But it was only a minute out of 30 hours of the game... it didnt affect the result of the match, Waugh said.

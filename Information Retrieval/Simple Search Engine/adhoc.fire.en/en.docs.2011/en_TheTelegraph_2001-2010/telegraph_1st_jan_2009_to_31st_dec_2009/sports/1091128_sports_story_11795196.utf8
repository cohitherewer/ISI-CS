	Dunedin: Pakistan pacers Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer neutralised the disadvantage of a 97-run first innings deficit as they brought hosts New Zealand down on their knees on the fourth day of the first Test here Friday.         
	The duo shared six wickets between themselves as the Black Caps collapsed to 147 for eight in their second innings.         
	Earlier in the day, Pakistan, resuming on an overnight score of 307 for eight, could add 25 more to their total before they were bowled out by New Zealand for 332. For the hosts, comeback-man Shane Bond returned figures of five for 107. His new ball partner Chris Martin finished with three for 63.         
	The Black Caps innings began on a disastrous note as they lost their first two wickets without the team opening their account. (Agencies)

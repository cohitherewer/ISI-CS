The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Planned my innings well, says Manoj
                                                   Planned my innings well, says Manoj
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Manoj Tiwary said he was satisfied with his unbeaten 96 against Delhi on Wednesday and knew it was his responsibility to stay till the end and see his side through.         
	I knew I had to stay till the end. The wicket was a bit slow and was offering turn. Other than LR (Shukla), this team has lot of youngsters. They are new and it was tough to handle the pressure situation, Tiwary told The Telegraph.         
	The stylish right-hand batsman was there till the end to ensure Bengal suffered no more hiccups during their chase.         
	I was the senior-most after LR got out, so I knew my responsibility. The run-rate was never out of our reach, it was hovering at around six and seven. I think I planned my innings well, he said.         
	Tiwary, who played his only one-day International till date against Australia in February last year in Brisbane, said he decided not to play against the spin to cut down on the risks.         
	I decided to target the extra-cover region and play with the spin. That way I cut down on the risks of getting out.         
	Tiwary also showered praise on the bowlers for restricting Delhi to a manageable total after a solid start. He picked up left-am spinner Iresh Saxena for special mention.         
	The kind of start Delhi got They lost their first wicket at around 80 in 15 overs and to restrict them to 209 was great. I think the bowlers, especially the spinners, bowled really well. Iresh (Saxena) was brilliant today, he said.         
	Tiwary added that Bengal, the runners up last season, would like to win the Vijay Hazare Trophy this time.

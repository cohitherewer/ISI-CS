                                                     Fitness is EBs priority 
            A STAFF REPORTER    
	Calcutta: A sixth place finish in the I-League and third on the table in the Calcutta league painted a sorry picture of East Bengal last season. But the eagerness of the players to set things right this time was evident when the city giants, under the guidance of coach Subhas Bhowmick, had their first practice session of the season at their club ground on Saturday.         
	Bhowmicks boys, who had their pre-season conditioning camp in Puri, had an almost two-hour long session with emphasis on ball training.         
	With four foreigners  Jan Berger, Edmilson, Sebastien and Rameez Dayub  already practising with the team and Ghanaian Yusif Yakubu slated to join later, East Bengal looked a sharp lot on Saturday.         
	Czech Republics Berger was the most impressive of the pack. That the 33-year-old, whose cousin Patrick is a former Liverpool player, is a key figure in Bhowmicks scheme of things was clear from the manner in which the coach utilised him.         
	The lanky footballer, who is left-footed, displayed an elegant touch. With a booming shot in his repertoire, Berger looks set to be Bhowmicks trump card this season. Fitness didnt seem to be an issue for the former FC Grasshoppers player as he was a livewire in the ground, often orchestrating penetrating moves.         
	While Dayub and Edmilson looked okay, Argentine Sebastien certainly needs some fine-tuning. Among the Indians, Subhas Singh, Bhowmicks prize catch, from Air India, was undoubtedly the best and impressed with his speed and skills.         
	Bhowmick revealed that he was mainly concentrating on addressing the fitness issues of the players now and that tactical planning will be done during their upcoming tour of Mayanmar.         
	We are focusing on fitness training at present. The players are a little stiff from the rigorous physical training of the last couple of weeks and their bodies need time to return to normalcy. Team combination and other tactical agendas will be addressed during the tour of Myanmar, he said.         
	Commenting on Yakubus absence from the pre-season training, Bhowmick argued: His missing the conditioning camp is absolutely his loss He should be the one to think about it. We will decide on him after he comes back.         
	With a quite a number of fans flocking the ground for the practice and cheering every good shot or move, East Bengals pledge to fulfil expectations was visible as they left the ground with battle cries of we will win, we shall win.

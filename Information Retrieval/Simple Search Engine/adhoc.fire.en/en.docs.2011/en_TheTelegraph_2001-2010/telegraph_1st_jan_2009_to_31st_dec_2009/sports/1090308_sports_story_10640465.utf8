                                                     Md. Sp., United play out a draw
            A STAFF REPORTER            Mike Okoro                           
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting managed to escape with a 2-2 draw against United SC in an 18th round encounter of the I-league at the Barasat Stadium on Saturday. The result may not be what the black and white brigade would have ideally liked, but nevertheless, they, have a point to show for their effort.         
	Mohammedan Sportings enterprising play in the second half kept their hopes of survival among the elite of the I-league alive. It was the brilliance of Mike Okoro that gave them the vital point, which could prove crucial in their effort to beat the drop. In the 79th minute, Okoro unleashed a superb back volley into the top left corner to make it 2-2.         
	Earlier in the first half, Mohammedan Sporting reflected very little of their desperation which their coach Shabbir Ali talked about on Friday. A disjointed midfield ensured that Okoro and Suroj Mondals role upfront turned out to be that of mere spectators.         
	United SC could have taken the lead in the 11th minute had Shankar Oraon not shot over the crosspiece with only the goalkeeper to beat.         
	But they didnt have to wait too long as Muritala Ali gave United the lead in the 17th minute. Muritalas opportunistic strike off a Daniel pass did not give the Mohammedan Sporting goalkeeper Naseem Akhtar any time to react.         
	Three minutes later Mohammedan Sporting had a close shave when Denson Devadass thunderous shot beat Naseem only to find the horizontal on way.         
	Mohammedan Sporting got the equaliser a couple of minutes before the hour mark. Eugene Gray ran down the right wing and released a low cross. Suroj Mondal was in the right position and didnt make any mistake in tapping the ball in.         
	United struck again in the 75th minute when Oraons left-footer off a Muritala pass hit the back of the net. And then, as things once again looked bleak for Mohammedan Sporting, Okoro stamped his class.         
	With this draw, Mohammedan Sporting now have 16 points, while United have 21 points.

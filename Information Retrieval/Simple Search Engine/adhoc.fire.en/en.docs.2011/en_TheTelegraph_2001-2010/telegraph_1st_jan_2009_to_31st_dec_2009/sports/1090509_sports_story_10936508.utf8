The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Alex not optimistic about appeal
                                                   Alex not optimistic about appeal
                      
	London: Manchester United have asked Uefa to overturn the controversial red card that will keep midfielder Darren Fletcher out of the Champions League final but are not anticipating success, manager Alex Ferguson said on Friday.         
	Fletcher was sent off for what looked a fair challenge on Arsenals Cesc Fabregas late in Tuesdays semi-final second leg at the Emirates, which United won 3-1 to progress 4-1 on aggregate.         
	We have written a compassionate letter to Uefa, Ferguson told a news conference. We understand the system and honestly believe the referee made the right decision at the time. From his angle and from where I was, I thought it was a penalty myself. But were not optimistic at all. We have to do it for Darren and in fairness to Darren. But, sometimes, in these situations when everything is addressed, you never know.         
	Hes quite a placid lad, hes not an emotional boy, he accepts it although its disappointing for him, obviously.         
	Uefa had said the only grounds for appeal were in a case of mistaken identity, which is not an issue with Fletcher. However, British newspapers said United, encouraged by comments from the European governing bodys general secretary David Taylor, had asked if Uefa believed referee Roberto Rosettis decision was correct in the hope that it might be reviewed.         
	Ive spoken with Alex Ferguson personally on this  as fate would have it we shared a car after the match, Taylor told Thursdays The Sun.         
	Strictly speaking there is no appeal process but representation can be made. If the club want to write to us with information  such as video evidence  explaining why they think this is a harsh punishment then they can do that. The likelihood is wed refer it to our disciplinary body. They would then look to see if there were any special circumstances to justify any departure from established procedures.         
	A Uefa spokesman was quoted by British newspapers on Friday as saying: The chances of an appeal being successful are quite slim because a protest is only admissible on the grounds of mistaken identity and that is not the case in this instance.

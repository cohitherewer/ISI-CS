	Barcelona: Spain retained the Davis Cup by winning the doubles match Saturday and taking an insurmountable 3-0 lead over the Czech Republic in the final.         
	Feliciano Lopez and Fernando Verdasco beat Radek Stepanek and Tomas Berdych 7-6 (7), 7-5, 6-2 in the deciding match on clay at Palau Sant Jordi.         
	Spain, who won their fourth title since 2000, is the first country since Sweden in 1998 to defend the trophy.         
	Spain took advantage of Berdychs shaky service game for three of its four breaks.         
	On Friday, David Ferrer beat marathon man Stepanek at his own game to put Spain 2-0 up after Rafael Nadals timely return to form had given the hosts an ideal start. (Agencies)

	Nottingham: Australias T20 specialist David Hussey had an interaction with the media on Sunday afternoon. Later, he briefly spoke to The Telegraph.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Losing to the West Indies in the first match         
	A disappointing result, but we have to move on... We have to win against Sri Lanka (on Monday) and win well to stay in the tournament... We have our backs against the wall, but we Australians love being in that situation.         
	Task ahead         
	We know what we have to do. In the last edition, we lost to Zimbabwe, but still ended up being in the semi-final. Unfortunately, we lost to India. Hopefully, we can replicate being in the semis and, hopefully, do one better this time.         
	Whether, at the top level, the Australians are still fine-tuning T20 skills         
	Anything can happen in T20...         
	 On Australia having recovered well in the 1999 (50-over) World Cup, which was held in England         
	We saw a couple of great performances then... Thats what these guys are capable of... We have a few match-winners, who can come through tomorrow and perform throughout the tournament as well.         
	Lessons from Saturdays defeat         
	The execution I guess (wasnt right)... Unfortunately, we ran into Chris Gayle in top form... When hes in that sort of form, then hes a world-class batsman and as good as anybody... Gayles very intimidating and probably one of the worlds best in T20... Hopefully, tomorrow, you will see a more disciplined Australian team.         
	The run-rate situation         
	It (run-rate) is very important and we know what we have to do against Sri Lanka. We have to come out all guns blazing and win very well. T20 is exciting and you could see an Australian team coming out and playing very good cricket.         
	Mood in the dressing room         
	Obviously, we were a little down after the defeat... We had a team meeting where we reassessed our goals and plans... Ricky (Ponting), in fact, said no more discussions and that we should just go out and win...         
	Adapting to conditions in England         
	We have players who play across the world... Play County cricket too... We must adapt as quickly as possible. Hopefully, we will win well and go from strength to strength.         
	His familiarity with Trent Bridge, having played for Nottinghamshire         
	(Smiles) Trent Bridge is a great place to play cricket... Its the home of English cricket... I know the conditions here particularly well and, in the team meeting, hope to give away a few secrets!         
	On England losing to The Netherlands         
	We were happy, to be honest. All the boys were watching that match on Sky... It was a great moment for Dirk Nannes and the rest, but it also put us under a lot of pressure, realising that anything can happen in T20 cricket. The result was fantastic for the world of cricket.         
	The Ashes, which begins next month         
	Im not part of the Ashes squad... To be honest, though, we havent spoken about it (on this tour)... Were focused on this tournament as the World T20 is the only competition that we havent won.         
	Significance of the World T20 for him         
	Its massive... Its my chance to do well on an international stage... My goal is to play Tests, for thats what international cricket is all about.         
	His franchise, the Kolkata Knight Riders, finishing last in the IPLs second edition         
	Yeah, it was very disappointing... Owing to national commitments, I could join the Knights very late... If you reflect on the results, youll find we lost a number of matches in the last over... In other words, there were many close finishes... Im confident the Knights will do well next year.         
	Finally, on the player who could make the difference for the Knights in 2010         
	Ishant Sharma... Im also hopeful that (Brendon) McCullum will impact big with the bat.

                                                                                                                       7                                        Bhaichung takes   EB to semi-finals
    - federation cup Red and gold brigade will clash with arch-rivals Bagan                 Bhaichung Bhutia                                 
	Silchar: Star striker Bhaichung Bhutia scored eight minutes from time to guide a 10-man East Bengal to a solitary goal win over JCT in their final Group A match and book a berth in the semi-finals of the Federation Cup here on Sunday.         
	Bhutia, who came in place of Alvito DCunha in the 75th minute, made an oppourtinistic strike seven minutes after he entered the field as a loose ball fell on his way after a scramble inside the JCT box at the Satindra Mohan Dev Memorial Stadium here.         
	The India captain thus more than made up for his absence from the Kolkata side for the two earlier group matches due to a hamstring injury.         
	With two wins and a draw, East Bengal emerged group winners with seven points and they will face their arch-rivals in the second semi-final at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Guwahati on December 31.         
	East Bengal were down with 10 men from the 25th minute when Harmanjot Khabra got his second booking after his first offence as early as the eighth minute but the red and gold brigade fought valiantly to emerge victorious.         
	East Bengal almost took the lead in the 11th minute with their Ghanaian striker Yusif Yakubu feeding Saumik Dey for a superbly taken left-footer but JCT custodian Karanjit Singh was equal at the task to make a brilliant save.         
	Just at the stroke of half-time, JCTs Penn Orji almost found the target with his strike from the top of the box but East Bengal goalkeeper Abhra Mondal dived full length to push the ball away for a corner.         
	After the breather, JCT pressed hard for the equaliser but failed to capitalised on the one-man advantage.         
	They had a couple of shots at the Mohun Bagan goal and were again denied any success by the brilliance of Mondal again towards the close.         
	In the 52nd minute, Baljit got a free header off a corner by Baldeep Singh but went straight to Mondal.         
	Six minutes later, Saktar Singh shot wide off a cross from the right by Baldeep once again.         
	Bhutia, whose name the seizable crowd had been chanting since the start of the match, finally came in the 75th minute and he got the only goal of the match with an opportunistic goal.         
	Mondal saved Mohun Bagan from conceding the equaliser in the 84th minute as he dived to punched away a Jaswinder Singh volley.         
	Later, in an inconsequential Group A match, Viva Kerala held Salgaocar to a 1-1 draw.         
	For Viva, Reuben Senyo scored the goal in 36th minute, while Manjdou Keita found the nets for Salgaocar in 88th minute.           (PTI)

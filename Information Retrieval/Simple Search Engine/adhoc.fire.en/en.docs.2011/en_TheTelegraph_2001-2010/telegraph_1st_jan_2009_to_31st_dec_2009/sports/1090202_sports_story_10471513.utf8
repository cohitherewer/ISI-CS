The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussie woes continue, NZ win 1st one-dayer
                                                   Aussie woes continue, NZ win 1st one-dayer
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Perth: Australias misery continued with New Zealand on Sunday defeating them by two wickets to clinch a low-scoring thriller and take a 1-0 lead in the five-match ODI series.         
	Chasing a victory target of 182, New Zealand huffed and puffed before Ross Taylor (64) propped them up.         
	Needing five runs off the last over, the Black Caps levelled the score in the fifth ball before captain Daniel Vettori hit the winning run off the last delivery from Nathan Bracken.         
	Earlier, after Australia captain Ricky Ponting had decided to bat first, New Zealand spearhead Kyle Mills (4/35) and his colleagues skittled out the hosts for 181 in 48.4 overs.         
	The score could have been even more embarrassing for the hosts but thanks to Michael Hussey (49) and Brad Haddin (31) for their useful sixth wicket contributions.         
	New Zealand, like their opponent, too suffered a top order collapse before Taylor steadied the ship with a 97-ball 64 that included six fours and a six.         
	The Black Caps fumbled early in their chase as Shaun Tait trapped a scoreless Brendon McCullum with the second ball of the innings.         
	Bracken then removed Martin Guptil (13) and Mitchel Johnson caught Peter Fulton (7) off his own bowling to compound New Zealands problems. And Grant Elliots (8) dismissal in the 23rd over left the visitors reeling at 64 for four.         
	Meanwhile, Match Referee Roshan Mahanama imposed a fine on the Aussie team for maintaining a slow over-rate during on Sunday.         
	An ICC release, players are fined five per cent of their match fees for every over their side fails to bowl in the allotted time, with the captain fined double that amount.

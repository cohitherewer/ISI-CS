The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner -Diabolical out to settle scores
                                                                                                               Diabolical out to settle scores 
            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: It is going to be an absorbing battle of wits between Arabian Knight and Diabolical in the 2,800m Queen Elizabeth II Cup on Saturday. The two horses are basically front-runners. It will be interesting to see as to how each counters the others move. The past record favours Arabian Knights winning chances but the Jaggy Dhariwal-trainee had thrashed an unfit Diabolical on that occasion. A much fitter Diabolical, thanks to trainer Daniel David, is out to settle scores in the hands of jockey B. Prakash. The Calcutta Million, however, is going to be an easy pick for Daniels Sound Of Cheers. The Royal Gladiator filly is a winner of three races from as many starts and she looks good to do the trick again.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Second day washed out
                                                   Second day washed out
                      
	Chester-le-Street: Play was abandoned without a ball being bowled Friday on the second day of the second Test between England and the West Indies because of rain.         
	Heavy rain fell throughout the day, making the pitch unplayable. The umpires conducted a ground inspection at 1500 GMT and with no prospect of the weather improving they decided to abandon play for the day.         
	England will resume on 302 for two on Saturday, with Alastair Cook 126 not out and nightwatchman James Anderson unbeaten on four.         
	No.3 batsman Ravi Bopara had also scored a century after England won the toss and elected to bat. The hosts lead the two-match Test series 1-0. (AP)

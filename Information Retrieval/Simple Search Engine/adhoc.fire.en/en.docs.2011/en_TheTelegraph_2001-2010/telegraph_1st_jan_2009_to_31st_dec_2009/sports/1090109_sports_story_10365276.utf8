	Calcutta: Chikkarangappa stretched his lead to four strokes Thursday after the completion of the third round of the Lalit Suri Eastern India Junior Golf Championship being played at the par-70 Tollygunge Golf Club.         
	The Bangalore lad returned a card of one-under 69 to surge ahead of Rashid Khan and Ashbeer Saini by four and five strokes respectively after the penultimate round.         
	Both Rashid and Ashbeer shot identical rounds of two-over 72 on Thursday.         
	Chikkarangappa will go into the final round on Friday with a considerable gap between him and the nearest contenders, Rashid and Ashbeer.         
	Ashbeer, however, maintained his lead in Group B while Viraj Madappa led the standings in Group C.         
	Piyush Sangwan set the course on fire with a round of six-under 64 in the under-10 (D) category. Piyush led nearest rival Deepak Sharma by seven strokes.

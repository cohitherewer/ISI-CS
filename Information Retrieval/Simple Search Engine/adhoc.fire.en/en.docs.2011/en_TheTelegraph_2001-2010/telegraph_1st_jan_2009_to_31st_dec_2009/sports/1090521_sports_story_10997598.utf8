The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mumbai Indians to play for pride
                                                     Mumbai Indians to play for pride

	Pretoria: The Mumbai Indians, whose semi-final hopes are dead and buried, will play for pride as they take on current table-toppers the Delhi Daredevils in their last league encounter of the Indian Premier League (IPL) here on Thursday.         
	Languishing at the seventh spot, Sachin Tendulkars men will look to end their campaign on a positive note.         
	The Mumbai side had made a blistering start to their IPL campaign when they defeated the Chennai Super Kings in the opener. But four weeks down the line they find themselves bruised and battered as they could manage only five wins against seven loses to bag 11 points from 13 matches.         
	In contrast, the Delhi DareDevils are sitting pretty relaxed at the top and, so far, are the only team to make it to the semi-finals, winning nine out of 13 matches and with 18 points in their kitty.         
	However, Virender Sehwags men would look to boost their confidence ahead of the last-four clash. (PTI)

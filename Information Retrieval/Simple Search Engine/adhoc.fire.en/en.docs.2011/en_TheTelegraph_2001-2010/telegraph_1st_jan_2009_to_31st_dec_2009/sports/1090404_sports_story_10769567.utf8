The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Crowe apology
                                                   Crowe apology
                      
	Wellington: Former New Zealand skipper Martin Crowe has apologised for being too harsh and impatient while criticising Virender Sehwags captaincy during the second Test in Napier which ended in a draw.         
	I often have bad days and so I wish to apologise for being too harsh, too quickly, Crowe wrote in his column for a cricket website.         
	I should have waited and seen more of Sehwag as captain before casting an opinion, he added.         
	Crowe had termed Sehwag as the worst captain and referred to his decisions as unfocused thinking during the second Test in Napier. But his comments drew flak from former cricketers forcing the 46-year old New Zealander to admit that he should have been more patient.         
	Tony Greig has made it clear that he thinks I have been too harsh on Virender Sehwags captaincy in the second Test in Napier, Crowe said.         
	He rightly points out that Sehwag had a bad game, but who doesnt? He says, along with Ian Chappell, that Sehwag has done some good work as vice-captain in the past. I am not about to argue with these astute gentlemen.         
	I should have been more patient in assessing his role as a leader overall, after all he was only given the captaincy minutes before the toss, he clarified. (PTI)

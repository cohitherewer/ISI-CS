The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mumbai belongs to India: Sachin
                                                                                                                                   Mumbai belongs to India: Sachin
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar on Friday said he had changed, as a player and a person, since making his Test debut 20 years ago.         
	The 36-year-old champion batsman spoke at a news conference on the long journey he had embarked on November 15, 1989, when he made his debut in the first Test against Pakistan in Karachi, and one which he still continues.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q The most treasured moment in his career         
	A There have been many special moments. Twenty years is a long time and it would be difficult to pick one. The first Test, the first day when I walked out with the playing XI in Pakistan, was probably the greatest moment. Thats where the journey began. We played some terrific cricket after that. My mother prayed for me and Indias success In the second Test, I made 59. It was the turning point in my career After not doing well in the first Test, that helped me feel confident. I was able to tell myself that I belonged at this level.         
	His continuing passion for the game         
	I have not made any special effort. It (cricket) is in my heart. I enjoy playing the game. Somewhere still a 16-year-old boy lives within me. It is every childs and every players dream to play for India.         
	His most memorable knock         
	I remember a few Most important of all, to me, was the one against Pakistan in the 2003 World Cup. We won by six wickets.         
	Individual records or winning for India         
	I feel bad when the team lose, even if I have done well.         
	The Mumbai for Maharashtrians slogan by the MNS party         
	Mumbai belongs to India. That is how I look at it. I am a Maharashtrian and I am extremely proud of that But I am an Indian first.         
	His idea of aggression         
	Aggression should be inside. It has to benefit you and not your opponent.         
	The changes in the game since he began his career         
	Plenty of things! The introduction of the third umpire (Tendulkar was the first player to be adjudged out by third umpire in 1993), the Hot Spot, the introduction of Twenty20  the game has changed a lot.         
	Becoming an opener in the ODIs         
	I asked Azhar and Ajit Wadekar (team manager on the New Zealand tour) to give me one chance to open and then I would not ask them again if I failed... Going out and facing the new ball helped me grow as a cricketer.         
	Any chance of being the captain again         
	Things (with the Indian team) are going well. Im happy to play the mentors role. It doesnt matter whos captaining the side as long as we are all contributing.         
	The match-fixing scandal         
	Thats a dark chapter. Thats closed... (Instead) I would like to think of something which was fascinating. We won the series against Australia (2000-01) immediately after that... which was instrumental in bringing back the crowds to the stadiums.         
	On what helped him remain focussed on the game for so many years         
	Its my upbringing. Nobody in my family got carried away by my success. That is where my family made sure my feet were on the ground.         
	The support from his family over the years         
	My mother does not know much cricket, but will pray for my success and the country. I discuss cricket with my elder brother, Ajit, a lot. He knows my batting better than anyone else in the world.         
	On the late Raj Singh Dungarpur         
	Once, Mumbai were to play a Ranji Trophy semi-final and there was talk that I could be selected for the 1988-89 tour of the West Indies. Rajbhai (the chairman of selectors then) came up and said I would not be going as it was too early. He said I should concentrate on my exams and the Irani Cup tie, which was coming up. He said good things will happen. What he said, then and later, always meant a lot to me.

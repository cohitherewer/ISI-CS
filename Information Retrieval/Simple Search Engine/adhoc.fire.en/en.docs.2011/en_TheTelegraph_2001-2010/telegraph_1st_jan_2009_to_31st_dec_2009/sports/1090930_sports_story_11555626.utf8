                                                     New Zealand earn semi-final berth
                  Elliott celebrates one of his wickets on Tuesday                     
	Johannesburg: Grant Elliot and Shane Bond wreaked havoc in overcast conditions to bowl England out for a paltry 146 in 43.1 overs in a crucial last Group B match of the ICC Champions Trophy here Tuesday.               
	New Zealand beat England by four wickets, earning a semi-final spot. They reached the target in 27.1 overs               
	Elliot (4/31) utilised the bouncy wicket to great effect, running through the England middle order while Bond supported him ably, picking up three wickets for 21 runs to bowl out the Englishmen cheaply.         
	Paul Collingwood (40) and Ravi Bopara (30) were the notable run-getters for England as a rejuvenated New Zealand pace attack came to the fore when it mattered most.         
	Put in to bat under a cloudy sky, England started on a disastrous note, losing their captain Andrew Strauss for naught off the second ball of the innings, sneaking a Kyle Mills (1/19) rising delivery to wicket-keeper Brendon McCullum.         
	To the disappointment of England fans, Bond struck in back-to-back overs to see the Strauss-led side tottering at 14 for two after six overs. Opener Joe Denly was Bonds first casualty, clean bowled off a delivery that came in after pitching, and then last-match hero Owais Shah, going for a big hit over square leg, gave a simple catch to McCullum.         
	Collingwood and Eoin Morgan tried their level best to stabilise the England innings, adding 37 runs in 13.1 overs, before the latters struggling 40-ball nine-run innings was cut short by Ian Butler.

  - SLCONFIRM THERE ARE NO INJURY WORRIES OVER TILLEKARATNE DILSHAN
            Mahendra Singh Dhoni on arrival in Kanpur on Saturday.                           
	New Delhi/Kanpur: Miffed with the docile pitch in the drawn Ahmedabad Test against Sri Lanka, Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh Saturday said that such batting-friendly tracks would kill Test cricket.         
	Such pitches will kill Test cricket. Its a free ticket to batsmen and offers no contest, Harbhajan said.         
	The Motera track has drawn flak from all quarters and both captains, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Kumar Sangakkara, said they expected the pitch to offer some assistance to the bowlers on the last two days.         
	Dhoni, however, added that it was not the flattest of pitches he had played on.         
	The bigger picture ought to make the Board of Control for Cricket in India sit up and take notice.         
	Seven of the last 12 Tests in India have been draws. One triple century, six double and as many as 32 Test centuries have been hit.         
	One score in excess of 700, three each of 600 and 500 runs and no less than six scores of 400 and more have been managed.         
	The bowlers understandably have groaned under the strain. It has not mattered if the likes of Dale Steyn, Andrew Flintoff, Shoaib Akhtar or Muthiah Muralidharan have been in operation. Bowlers now have genuine concerns for their careers in India, said Harbhajan.         
	Despite his two for 189 from 48 overs at Motera, Harbhajan is not overtly concerned about his own well-being as he has picked up 54 wickets from these 12 Tests against batting sides such as Pakistan, South Africa, Australia, England and Sri Lanka.         
	His 216 wickets from 43 Tests at home at an average of 27.40, with 17 five-wicket and four 10-wicket hauls is still very impressive.         
	Its not me alone. At least I bowled on the second and third days (of the Motera Test).         
	The best match-winner in the history of the game (Murali) was struggling to go past the bat even on the fifth afternoon, said Harbhajan with palpable concern.         
	It doesnt matter if the pitch is not spinner-friendly. It would be alright even if it helps seamers alone. But bowlers need to be in business. They shouldnt be there to just serve the batsmen, he added.         
	No doubt, the spectators were robbed of an entertaining Test by a poor wicket. How will the curator justify around 1600 runs and only 21 wickets over five days!         
	Not without reason has Greg Chappell voiced his concern about the future of Tests.         
	Meanwhile, Tillekaratne Dilshans injury on his nose has been diagnosed as a fracture but the Sri Lanka team manager confirmed that he will be available for the second Test, starting Tuesday.         
	Dilshan collided with one of his team-mates while playing football after the first Test in Ahmedabad. An X-ray has revealed a fracture.         
	Brendon Kuruppu, the Sri Lankas team manager, though said there was no need to worry as the injury was not too serious.         
	The injury was set right by the surgeon before we left for Kanpur and Dilshan is out of danger, Kuruppu said. He is not in any kind of discomfort. He will resume practice with the rest of the team, the manager added.         
	The teams arrived in Kanpur Saturday for the second Test match.         
	However, the Indian trio of Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh and Gautam Gambhir have not arrived with the team and will reach tomorrow. They trio were in Delhi for personal reasons.         
	The teams landed in Kanpur in the afternoon and amid tight security were taken to the hotel.           (AGENCIES)

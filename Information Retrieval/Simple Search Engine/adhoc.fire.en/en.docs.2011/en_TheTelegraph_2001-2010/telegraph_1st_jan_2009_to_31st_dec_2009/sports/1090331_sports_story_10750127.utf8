                                                  Pietersen not granted leave  Bridgetown: England captain Andrew Strauss confirmed that batsman Kevin Pietersen was denied permission to leave the team rsquo;s troubled tour to the West Indies to visit home. Pietersen, who was stripped of the captaincy in January over a falling out with former coach Peter Moores, had asked a month ago to take a 48-hour break between the drawn third and fourth Tests.  ldquo;The permission wasn rsquo;t granted because we rsquo;re on a cricket tour and it sets a bad precedent if people can go home during cricket tours, rdquo; Strauss said Sunday. ldquo;He understood that fully and it wasn rsquo;t an issue by any means and he just got on with it. rdquo;  Adam lecture  London: Adam Gilchrist is to give the 2009 MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture here at Lord rsquo;s Cricket Ground on June 24, it was announced on Monday. The 37-year-old former Australia wicketkeeper, still playing Twenty20 cricket for IPL side Deccan Chargers, will be the youngest person to give the lecture, established in 2001 in memory of former England captain Colin Cowdrey.  County cricket  Napier: New Zealand off-spinner Jeetan Patel became the third New Zealand player to strike a deal with an English county side this season, signing up with Warwickshire. He thus joined Grant Elliott (Surrey) and Iain O rsquo;Brien (Leicestershire) in the list.  Miandad back  Karachi: Two months after resigning as Pakistan Cricket Board rsquo;s Director-General, Javed Miandad returned on Monday to the post with more powers and the backing of PCB patron-in-chief and the country rsquo;s President Asif Ali Zardari. ldquo;I have been given a letter confirming me as Director-General and also special adviser to the chairman, Ejaz Butt by the board today, rdquo; Miandad said.  Roelof added  Johannesburg: Roelof van der Merwe has been added to South Africa rsquo;s squad for the first two one-day Internationals against Australia. Van der Merwe, 24, impressed in the Twenty20 victory over the tourists at Centurion on Sunday, top-scoring with 48 off 30 balls and taking one for 30 in his four overs.  ICC rule  Karachi: Pakistani batsman Rifatullah Mohmand, who wants to play for Afghanistan in the 2011 World Cup qualifying tournament in South Africa on the ground that his father was born in that country, has been stopped from doing so by the International Cricket Council.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Churchill Brothers enter last four
                                                   Churchill Brothers enter last four
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: I-League champions Churchill Brothers entered the semi-finals of the 114th IFA Shield beating Lajong FC 2-0 in a group league match at the Barasat Stadium on Friday.         
	Khemthang Paite drew first blood for the Goans in the 10th minute and Nigerian Okolie Odafe made it 2-0 from a penalty in the 87th minute. Churchills 2-0 win thus thrashed Calcutta outfit Mohammedan Sportings dream of making it to the last four stage.         
	The Goans will miss the services of Odafe, who was booked for a rough tackle, in the semis. The Nigerian striker was also booked in Churchills first match against Mohammedan Sporting on Wednesday.         
	Churchill took the lead when Paite, unmarked at the top of the box, latched onto Odafes back heel and volleyed home leaving the Lajong defenders stunned.         
	Seven minutes later, Reisangmi Vashum sent a measured cross for frontliner Durga Boro on the left whose shot hit the back of the net. But the goal was ruled off-side.         
	Jut when it seemed that Mohammedan Sporting might scrape through to the semis  Shabbir Alis boys would have qualified had Churchill won the match 1-0  the Goans were awarded a penalty.         
	Lajong forward Michael Bassey brought down Ogba Kalu inside the box and referee Rajib Mukherjee had no hesitation in pointing to the dreaded spot. Odafe made it 2-0 without much ado.         
	Churchill were far from their usual class though. While Odafe and Durga Boro looked listless upfront, the Goan midfield and the defence looked disjointed.         
	Even goalkeeper Lalit Thapa, who was later replaced by Arindam Bhattacharya, never looked confident. Thanks to the Lajong forward line, that Thapa was never tested.         
	TEAMS

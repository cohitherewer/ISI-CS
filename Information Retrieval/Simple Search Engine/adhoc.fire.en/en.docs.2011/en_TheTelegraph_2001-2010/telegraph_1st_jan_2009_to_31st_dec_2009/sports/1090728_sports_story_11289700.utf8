The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiwary knock goes in vain
                                                     Tiwary knock goes in vain
          
	Brisbane: Manoj Tiwarys unbeaten half century (51) went in vain as India paid the price for a top-order collapse to lose their second Twenty20 match of the Emerging Players Tournament against New Zealand by five wickets, here Monday.         
	Put in to bat, India scored 154 for five in their allotted 20 overs. Bengal batsman Tiwary, and Abhishek Nayar (45), batting at No. 5 and six respectively, were instrumental in taking Indias score past 150 after the top-order flopped against fast bowler Hamish Bennett (3/20).         
	Naman Ojha also chipped in with a 15-ball unbeaten 26.         
	Openers Ajinkya Rahane and Murali Vijay scored 10 and nine, respectively, while captain S. Badrinath, batting one-down, contributed just six runs. Virat Kohli, who followed in next, was out for a three-ball duck at the Albury Oval.         
	New Zealands emerging players rattled up 156 for five with Colin de Grandhomme top-scoring with 60.         
	Right-arm off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin took three for 22 from his four overs, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Amit Mishra took one wicket each.         
	Defending a competitive total, the Indian seamers failed to get the early breakthrough with Martin Guptill and De Grandhomme scoring freely. De Grandhomme hit six fours and a six during his 45-ball innings. Ashwin struck two quick blows to keep India in the hunt but crucial knocks from wicketkeeper Reece Young and Kane Williamson lower down the order were enough to secure a win for New Zealand.         
	India had lost their first Twenty20 match of the tournament against the Australian Institute of Sports on July 20. (PTI)

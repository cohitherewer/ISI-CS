	Madrid: Out of the darkness, light. Liverpool, robbed by injury of their captain, rocked by a day of insidious rumour surrounding Rafa Benitezs future, their Premier League challenge in pieces at their feet, last night beat Real Madrid in the Bernabeu. On such nights are reputations forged.         
	Yossi Benayouns 82nd-minute header from Fabio Aurelios inswinging free-kick gave Rafa Benitezs side an invaluable lead and a precious away goal, but its importance runs much deeper than that. Europes form team casually swept aside, delirium for the 6,000 travelling fans and proof, if it were needed, that in Benitez Liverpool have a manager of rare talent.         
	Tom Hicks and George Gillett would do well to make their next contract offer a blank page and tell Benitez to write his own conditions, if that is the price to pay for keeping hold of the Spaniard.         
	This game must have almost seemed like an afterthought for Liverpools players, fans and, more specifically, manager. After weeks of mounting hysteria, the rumours swept Liverpool on Tuesday and flew out to Madrid with less than 24 hours before kick off.         
	Benitez had walked off the team bus, Benitez had been sacked. Bookmakers stopped taking bets, fans thronged the internet forums.         
	It was a Real plot, his contract talks had collapsed. He would leave at the end of the season, he would leave at the end of the week. The club had descended into unadulterated chaos. Benitez was moved to dismiss the talk as ridiculous, but that suggests it had seeped through to the players. For Bellamy before Barcelona, read the Rafa rumours before Real. Liverpool really know how to gear themselves up for a big game.         
	Real, on the other hand, had the perfect preparation for the first instalment of a tie that will define their immediate future, too. They had won their last nine games, scored six in a single half at the weekend and have been resting key players for this game months in advance.         
	As if that was not advantage enough, Madrid spirits will have soared when they saw that Steven Gerrard, named on the bench, did not even warm up with his teammates.         
	The reverential fear with which the Spanish perceive Gerrard dissipated. In its stead came noise from the stands, an endless cacophony of whistles, drums and horns, and a relaxed swagger from the players. The artist formerly known as Lassana Diarra  now simply Lass  dominated the early midfield scuffles. The artist still known as Arjen Robben twisted and turned, jinked and feinted, toying with Aurelio. Inside five minutes, he fed Raul, and Reals blessed No. 7 fired straight at Pepe Reina. Marcelo stung Reinas palms with a fierce volley minutes later.         
	Where Real were crisp and neat, effortlessly switching play with all the class the weight of history demands from those who wear the pristine white shirt, Liverpool seemed coarse, almost vulgar, in comparison. Devoid of Gerrard, time and again they bypassed the economy of Xabi Alonso in favour of a long-ball game lacking in even the slightest guile.         
	Within 10 minutes, the Real were encouraging their side to attack with shouts of Arriba. The crowd scented blood and wanted caution abandoned. But, for all the crowds demands, Real found Liverpool as resolute as ever, and while the visitors could not match their hosts for panache, they edged their way into the game.         
	The best chance of the half, indeed, fell to Fernando Torres. Reina launched another long ball, Dirk Kuyt missed his flick and the Spanish international raced clear, only to see Iker Casillas palm his angled drive away.         
	In the second half, Real rallied briefly, Robben forcing Reina into a save, but the momentum had shifted. With eight minutes to go, Benayoun rose to nod past Casillas. Once more, Liverpools fans were engulfed by chaos.

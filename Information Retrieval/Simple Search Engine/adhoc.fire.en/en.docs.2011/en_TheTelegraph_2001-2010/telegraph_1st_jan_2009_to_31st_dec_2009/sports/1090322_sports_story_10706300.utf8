	Ludhiana: JCT struck once in each half to register a 2-0 victory over title contenders Sporting Clube de Goa in a 20th round match of the ONGC-I League at the Guru Nanak Stadium here Saturday.         
	The Punjab outfit, who were looking for a win to climb out of the relegation places, scored through Paul MacJames (9th minute) and Jagpreet Singh (77th) to garner full points. It has spoilt Sportings title hopes.         
	Sporting Clube though began the proceedings on a rousing note with skipper Wilton Gomes and Bibiano Fernandes weaving some good moves. Their striker Nathaniel Amos was off the target on a couple of occasions. In a counter attack in the ninth minute, JCTs Harish Sharma and Balwant Singh sneaked into the rival box and the former sent a parallel pass to MacJames whose blistering grounder found the back of the Sporting Clube net.

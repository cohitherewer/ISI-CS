The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan go down 0-1 in Syria
                                                   Bagan go down 0-1 in Syria

	Calcutta/Margao: Mohun Bagan lost 0-1 to Syrian club Al-Karamah in a Group B match of the AFC Cup at Hims, near Damascus, according to information received here late on Tuesday. Mohammed Al Hamwi scored the all-important goal in the 59th minute.         
	Dempos campaign in the AFC Cup took off on a bright note as they held on to a Ranty Martins first-half strike to down Syrian club Al Maged 1-0 in the Group E league match in Margao on Tuesday.         
	Bagan could have returned with a point at least but for Brazilian midfielder Marcos Pereira who missed a penalty two minutes before half time. Earlier, Shylo Malsawmtluanga made a mess of an easy opportunity with the rival goalkeeper Mosab Balhous at his mercy.         
	Playing in biting cold and in front of a 17,000-strong crowd, which was backing the Syrian club, it was indeed a creditable performance from Karim Bencharifas boys.         
	In Margao, Dempo played quick short passes and took the lead in the 24th minute. The hosts were awarded a free kick after defender Ali Al Rifaai brought down Clifford Miranda at the top of the box. Martins deflected Betos effort into the far corner.         
	Stung by the goal, the visitors mounted pressure and pushed last years AFC Cup semi-finalists into their own half. But the Dempo defence did well to thwart the visitors. The nearest Al Maged came to scoring was in the 32nd minute when a lob from Dame Junior was headed by Ali Hariri, but goalkeeper Abhijit Mondal was alert to the task.         
	Dempo had a close shave when a Hamzeh-Al-Aitouni effort kissed the crossbar before going out. Dempo now travel to Jordan to meet Al Failsay on March 17.

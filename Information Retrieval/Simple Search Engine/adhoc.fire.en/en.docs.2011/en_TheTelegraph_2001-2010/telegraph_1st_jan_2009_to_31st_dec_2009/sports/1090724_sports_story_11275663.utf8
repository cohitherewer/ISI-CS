The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sri Lanka face an uphill task
                                                     Sri Lanka face an uphill task
                  Danish Kaneria celebrates with Shoaib Malik in Colombo on Thursday                     
	Colombo: Pakistans Danish Kaneria picked up two wickets to jolt Sri Lankas record victory chase as the hosts closed Thursdays fourth day of the third Test on 183-3, needing 309 more runs on the final day with seven wickets in hand.         
	Pakistan declared their second innings at 425 for nine shortly after the lunch break on Day IV, and with a 66-run lead from the first innings they set a world record 492-run target for Sri Lanka to win the final test and sweep the series 3-0.         
	Sri Lanka made a strong start to the run chase before two late scalps put Pakistan back in charge. Sri Lanka openers Tharanga Paranavitana and Malinda Warnapura put on 83 for the first wicket before Kaneria broke through, with Warnapura (31) caught by Shoaib Malik at leg-slip.         
	Then captain Kumar Sangakkara joined Paranavitana in valuable 56-run partnership before Paranavitana (73) was snapped up by Fawad Alam at forward-short-leg off the bowling of Malik. Paranavitana faced 126 balls and hit five boundaries.         
	Mahela Jayawardene (2)  top scorer in the first innings  was caught soon after by wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal off Kaneria.         
	Sangakkara remained unbeaten at stumps on 50, his 32nd Test half-century, with Thilan Samaraweera on 20.         
	If Sri Lanka win this match they will take the record for the highest run chase to win a Test. The West Indies currently hold the record for reaching the highest fourth innings target, 418 for seven against Australia at Antigua six years ago.         
	Pakistan elected to bat on after lunch for just 11 minutes, adding 15 runs before declaring. Malik was the star of Pakistans second innings, scoring 134 and anchoring three key partnerships that lifted Pakistan from a vulnerable 67 for four. He spent more than six hours at the crease and faced 240 balls, hitting 12 fours and two sixes.         
	Resuming the fourth day on 300 for five, the visitors lost overnight batsman Akmal for 74 when he was caught by Jayawardene.           (AP)

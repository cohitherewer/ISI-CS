                                                     Dhoni doing a great job: Kapil
  - Souravs coming into cricket administration will be beneficial says cup-winning captain       A STAFF REPORTER            Kapil Dev in the city on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: When the mighty West Indies went down to rank outsiders in the 1983 World Cup final, the legend of the man who led the team to that historic win was secured.         
	That larger than life figure, Indias Cricketer of the Century, Kapil Dev is held by many to be the greatest pace bowler the country has produced. He retired from the game, in 1994, as the highest wicket taker in Test cricket with 434 scalps to his name.         
	Kapil shared his views on the current crop of cricketers and the game at large at an interactive session with school children, in the city Tuesday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On Mahendra Singh Dhonis captaincy         
	The captain of the national team is the best man. Dhoni is doing a great job and I wish him and the Indian team all the very best.         
	Sachin Tendulkars incredible form, even at the age of 36         
	Sachin is playing incredibly well and I dont know for how long hell be playing. Thats for him to decide. I think it depends on his fitness because technically he is very sound. If he manages to keep his fitness level up, he should be playing for some more time.         
	Sourav Ganguly entering sports administration         
	If Sourav doesnt enter the fray then should more politicians be brought into administration? When it comes to cricket, Sourav knows best and his coming into the administration will be beneficial... if a doctor is required, then will a doctor do that job or an engineer?         
	Indias chances in the Champions Trophy given the absence of Virender Sehwag and Zaheer Khan         
	Indian selectors have picked the best possible team under the circumstances. If one is injured then how can he be asked to play?         
	Established players themselves feel sad when they are unable to play. The fans get unhappy that the players are injured one would even try to recall Sunil Gavaskar and other greats to come and play so that India has the best team.         
	Rahul Dravids return to the team         
	The selectors have the responsibility of selecting the best team. One hopes they arent influenced by personal likes and dislikes while selecting the team.         
	On the new ODI formula doing the rounds         
	Its a very premature question. Its a thought but its going to take time to fulfil that. Cricket is a very popular game and gaining more popularity every day. Why talk of change so fast?         
	Whether Tests and one-dayers need to be revived in the age of T20 cricket         
	Tests and one-dayers are still on and very much followed by all. All three have their own place. If interest in Tests and ODIs had waned following the emergence of T20, then those formats wouldnt have enjoyed the television ratings they currently do.         
	Sourav no longer playing in the national team         
	One cant be on the team forever. Sure it feels bad when great players no longer play but one must realise that Sourav had replaced someone when he came into the team. Similarly, someone else has replaced him today.         
	On winning the 1983 World Cup as underdogs and whether the captain needs to motivate the team         
	You dont need inspiration or motivation at that level. You are playing for your country and thats motivation enough.         
	A captain is needed to bring back the focus of the players but not for motivation to win. As captain one can never say this particular player is better than the other. All of them are the best. A captain cant single out someone.

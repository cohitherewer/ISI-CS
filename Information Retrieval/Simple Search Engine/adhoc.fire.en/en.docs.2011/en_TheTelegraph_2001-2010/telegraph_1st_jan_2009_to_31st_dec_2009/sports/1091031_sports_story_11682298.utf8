                                                   Brett Lee to consult specialist
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Australias campaign in the ongoing seven-match one-day International series against India suffered another setback Friday as pace spearhead Brett Lee was ruled out of the rest of the series because of an elbow injury.         
	Australia arrived for their India tour without Michael Clarke, Callum Ferguson and Brad Haddin  all nursing injuries.         
	Wicket-keeper Tim Paine had been ruled out after he fractured a finger during the second ODI in Nagpur.         
	The 32-year-old Lee, who was unable to complete his 10 overs during the first ODI in Vadodara, would return home to consult specialists, the Cricket Australia said in a statement Friday.         
	Lee wasnt available for selection in the second match in Nagpur.         
	Team physiotherapist Kevin Sims said: Bretts elbow injury has not responded as well to treatment as we would have liked and therefore a decision has been made to send him home to consult with an elbow specialist.         
	With an accurate diagnosis we can determine how best to manage the injury and give Brett the best chance of being available for selection at the beginning of the Australian summer, Sims added.         
	The statement added that CAs selection panel were working through the process of naming a replacement for Lee.

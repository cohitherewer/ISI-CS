  - Ranadeb Boses five-wicket haul hits UP hard but Bengal batsmen disappoint             Ranadeb Bose                           
	Kanpur: Wickets fell like ninepins with 22 of them tumbling on a dramatic second day of Bengals crucial Ranji Trophy Super League tie against Uttar Pradesh here Wednesday.         
	In a shocking morning session, Uttar Pradesh were shot out for a paltry 62 in 24.1 overs in reply to Bengals first innings score of 193. The hosts then stepped up to the plate somewhat, bundling out Bengal for 104 in their second innings.         
	That was not all. Uttar Pradesh, in their second innings, lost two wickets for 53, chasing of 236 for victory. Mohammed Kaif (1) and Shivakant Shukla (18) were at the crease at close of play.         
	Ranadeb Bose, who has been the flag-bearer of the Bengal attack, took centre stage once again with a sterling performance.         
	With moisture conspiring with the hint of green on the pitch, Bose, in the absence of usual new-ball partner Ashok Dinda, who is doing national duty in the T20s against Sri Lanka, had to take up the baton. And he did it in style clinching the first five Uttar Pradesh wickets.         
	In his third over of the innings, Bose struck off consecutive deliveries to remove Shivakant Shukla (2) and Rohit Srivastava (0). Both were trapped in front by the tall medium-pacer.         
	India discard Kaif (4) was his next victim when the Uttar Pradesh captain was caught by Manoj Tiwary.         
	He piled more agony on the hosts as he castled Parvinder Singh for a duck in his very next over. Bhuvaneshwar Kumar fell in Boses very next delivery as the Uttar Pradesh scoreboard read a horrific 15 for five.         
	Boses new-ball partner Sourav Sarkar and Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla then finished off the job started by Bose. But it was only a brief joy for Shukla and Co. as Bengal decided to emulate their opponents in the second innings.         
	Poor shot selection, and not the pitch, which had eased out later on in the day, was the reason behind Bengals debacle in the second innings.         
	Openers Arindam Das and Deep Dasgupta were removed with the team score on nine.         
	Tiwary, who shoulders much of Bengals hope, departed on the very first ball he faced. Former India captain Sourav Ganguly fared no better, falling for a duck.         
	But it was Shulkas 56-run eighth wicket partnership with Sourav Sarkar that helped Bengal add vital runs to their total.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barcelona smash six past Malaga
                                                     Barcelona smash six past Malaga
                  Samuel Eto                     
	Madrid: Barcelona showed Real Madrid they will take some budging from the top of the table with an emphatic 6-0 home win over Malaga on Sunday to restore their six-point cushion over the champions. A few hours earlier Real had defeated Almeria 3-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu to cut Barcelonas lead to three points, but Pep Guardiolas side responded by cutting poor Malaga to shreds.         
	Xavi, Lionel Messi, Thierry Henry and Samuel Eto were all on target in a sensational first 45 minutes and Malaga couldnt wait for the half-time whistle.         
	It was more of the same in the second half with Eto scoring his second on 56 minutes while marauding right back Dani Alves (51) also netted.         
	 Barcelona have plundered 84 goals this season at an average of three goals a game and are well on course to reach a century before the end of the season.         
	Cameroon attacker Eto leads the way with 25 goals while Messi has 19 for the season and Henry a creditable 15.         
	The trio were on the scoresheet against Malaga but Brazilian Alves had the honour of scoring the goal of the game heading in after a sublime pass from Andres Iniesta had carved the visitors open.         
	Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar made it eight goals in his last six games with a brace as Real Madrid eased to a 3-0 win over Almeria.         
	Brazilian Marcelo, jeered by his own fans this season, silenced the doubters with a 23rd minute opener before Huntelaar showed his predatory instincts in the 52nd and 65th minutes to wrap up the points.         
	Meanwhile, in Italy, Inter Milan took another big step towards retaining their Serie A title with an easy 3-0 win over bottom side Reggina on Sunday. Midfielder Esteban Cambiasso, playing as an emergency centre back, clipped home after six minutes following Dejan Stankovics clever flick before Zlatan Ibrahimovic slotted in a penalty.

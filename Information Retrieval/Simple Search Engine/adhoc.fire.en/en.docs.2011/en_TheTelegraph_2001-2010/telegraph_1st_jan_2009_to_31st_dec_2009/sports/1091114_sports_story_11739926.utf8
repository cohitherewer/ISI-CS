The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chidi rocks Pune FC
                                                                                                                                   Chidi rocks Pune FC
                      
	Pune: Edeh Chidi looks the perfect vehicle for Mohun Bagans dreams after he struck all three goals in their 3-1 defeat of Pune FC in the I-League on Friday.         
	The build-up to the match at the Balewadi Stadium has been uninspiring, with torrential rain that lashed the city hitting practice and virtually leaving Bagan marooned.         
	The signs were ominous. Under the circumstances, it was felt that the best that could happen would be for the tie to be postponed. Indeed, Chidi, Marcos Pereira and N. Mohanraj had even been reportedly nursing minor niggles.         
	Pune FC, on the other hand, have shown they dont lose too many. Not that they win whenever they dont lose but the grit of the beginner has seen the I-League newcomers go into Firdays clash having drawn six of their last seven encounters.         
	Impressive, but Chidi thought otherwise. The Nigerian was the lone wolf upfront with a five-man midfield to support him. But, for his first, Chidi poached alone.         
	In the 37th minute, Chidi received a cross from the right and accelerating with the ball at his feet, raced into the Pune FC box to slot it into the bottom corner of the far post.         
	The second came in the 61st minute and was a replay almost of the first goal. Another solo run another solo goal.         
	The third goal came off a delightful one-two between Tomba Singh and Chidi as the former laid one for the striker to slot home. But Chidi was not the only positive for a Bagan that went into the match with a win and a loss in their last two match.         
	Coach Karim Bencharifa would be happy with the teams performance as a unit. Bagan controlled the proceedings and the team are beginning to look like last seasons title challengers.         
	Throughout all this while, Derrick Perreiras boys had remained silent but, to be fair, they had their chances. Pune FC made a good move through Sergey Tokov and Douhou, but the home side failed to finish.         
	They had their consolation though when at the fag end, in injury time to be precise they were awarded a penalty which Douhou fired into the net.         
	Bagan, who had shared points with Sporting Clube de Goa in their previous match, thus ended the first phase on a winning note. The win lifted the green and maroon brigade to the fifth position in the standings with 13 points from eight matches. Pune FC lie in the 10th slot with six points.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The India under-23 team reached the semi-finals of the SAFF Cup in Dhaka, edging 1-0 past Nepal in their group league match on Monday.         
	With six points from two matches, India are now top of their group followed by the Maldives, the defending champions, who have four points. India play the Maldives in the last league match on Wednesday.         
	Our first task was to reach the last-four, said India coach Sukhwinder Singh from Dhaka. We are happy to have achieved the target.         
	The only goal came in the 18th minute when India earned a free-kick outside the Nepal penalty area. Robert Lalthalmas hard and accurate shot was fisted away by goalkeeper Bikash Malla but he deflected the ball into his own net after Jeebon Singhs header off the rebound hit the crosspiece and landed on the goalmouth.         
	Overall, India had a good day in office and were able to ward off some second-half pressure from Nepal thanks to a couple of brilliant saves by goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya.         
	We could have scored a few more goals, said Sukhwinder. Jagpreets injury in the previous match was a setback for the team. But Manish Mathani did a good job in the midfield.

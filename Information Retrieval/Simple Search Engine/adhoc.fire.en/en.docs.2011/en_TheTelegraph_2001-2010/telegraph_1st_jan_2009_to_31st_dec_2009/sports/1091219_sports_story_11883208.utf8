The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wickets tumble on third day
                                                                                                                       7                                      Wickets tumble on third day
                      
	Perth: Australia pacer Doug Bollinger took five for 70 before the West Indies hit back as the third Test between the two sides took an interesting turn Friday.         
	Caribbeans reduced Australia to 137 for eight in their second innings but that means the hosts enter the fourth day with a 345-run lead, which ensures Chris Gayle and Co. will have a tough target ahead of them when they come out to bat in the fourth innings. But the target would look smaller if Gayle shows half of his first-innings form.         
	Bollingers five-wicket haul gave Ricky Pontings men a 208-run first innings lead. The Australian captain decided not to enforce the follow-on, according to Cricinfo.

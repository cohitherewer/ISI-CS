The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL at Eden likely to be dearer
                                                                                                                       7                                      IPL at Eden likely to be dearer
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: In all likelihood, cricket crazy Calcuttans will have to shell out more money to watch Kolkata Knight Riders home matches in the next edition of the Indian Premier League.         
	The Eden is undergoing renovation and four blocks  B, C, K and L  have been dismantled. As the renovation work is unlikely to be completed by March next year, around 43,000 seats will be available for IPL III. With capacity reduced to half, there is a possibility that the ticket rates might increase.         
	It looks unlikely that KKR will keep the prices of the tickets same as 2008. No organisation will like to incur losses, a CAB official said. However, when quizzed on this, a KKR official refused to commit. We have to work out a feasible solution which is acceptable to one and all. There is still some time to take a final call, he informed.         
	It must be mentioned that the denomination of daily tickets for KKR home matches in 2008 were Rs 200, Rs 400 and Rs 600 respectively. The season tickets were priced at Rs 1,050, Rs 1,750 and Rs 3,500 respectively. What happens when the renovation is complete and the Eden is back to full capacity?         
	That is a distant thing. We have to go by the market, the official answered.         
	Franchise co-owner Jay Mehta Tuesday inspected the renovation work at the stadium. Before the inspection, he was engaged in an hour-long meeting with CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya.         
	We briefed them about the renovation work. They also made a suggestion that the seats in Blocks F, G and H should be converted to bucket seats, Dalmiya said.

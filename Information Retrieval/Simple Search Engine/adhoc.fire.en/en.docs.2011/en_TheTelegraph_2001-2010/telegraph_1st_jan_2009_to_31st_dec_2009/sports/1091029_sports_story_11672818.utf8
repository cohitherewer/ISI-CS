                                                     Ricky Ponting: Indians upset all calculations
  - Aussie Wicket-keeper Paine ruled out of series with broken finger         OUR CORRESPONDENT            Gautam Gambhir in action during the second one-day International against Australia, in Nagpur, on Wednesday. (PTI)                                 
	Nagpur: The Australians injury list seems to grow by the day. On Wednesday, Tim Paine fractured his finger while trying to collect a Peter Siddle delivery in the eighth over.         
	Tim has a broken finger. He will be going back home We havent decided on his replacement but he (the replacement) should be available for the next match in Delhi, Ricky Ponting said after the match.         
	The Australian captain admitted they were outplayed on Wednesday. India seized the momentum early on and once we were 45 for three, we were out of the game. Our batsmen had everything to lose and gained nothing today (Wednesday), Ponting said at the media conference.         
	Does he lament his decision to field? Its not often that I decide to bowl on winning the toss. I thought our batting was strong and we could chase comfortably. But Indians upset all calculations.         
	Asked if Brett Lees presence could have made a difference, he said: It couldve made a difference. But it was also an opportunity for the others to showcase their talent. Unfortunately, we came up a bit short, he said.         
	The death overs have been a cause for concern for the Australians. Ever since Glenn McGrath has moved out, the death overs have been a problem. We were a few centimetres away from executing our plans today.  
	Highlights  
	Mahendra Singh Dhonis century is the first by an Indian captain against Australia. The previous highest being Mohammed Azharuddins 93 in Brisbane on March 1, 1992.

	Chennai: Somdev Dev Varman ended the most successful week of his career so far with an endearing performance, suffering a gallant loss in the Chennai Open final on Sunday.         
	The 23-year-old from Assam went down 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) to Croatian sensation Marin Cilic in the summit clash at the Nungambakkam stadium, but it was one of those matches whose outcome is not a reflection of the performance on the court.         
	This is not to say Cilic played badly. Although the 20-year-old wasnt entirely at his best, he still produced flashes of genius while subduing Somdev and pocketing his second ATP title plus the winners purse of $73,000. After all, it is not for nothing that he has been touted a potential Wimbledon champion by his coach, none other than Bob Brett, who has, in the past, guided the likes of Boris Becker.         
	Rather, the result failed to diminish what the Indian has accomplished in the last seven days. Playing in his maiden final, Somdev was one win away from what none of his compatriots have accomplished in the last decade  an ATP singles title. The quality of shot-making the youngster produced during the course of his two-hour battle was something that Indian fans have not seen  with the exception of Sania Mirza  in recent years.         
	Somdev knew he had his task cut out on Sunday, and realised what he was up against early when Cilic forced a breakpoint in the second game of the opening set. He wriggled out of it only to face another breakpoint in the fourth. On both occasions, Cilic failed to deliver the killer punch as he sprayed his shots.         
	Then, it was the turn of the Indian to force his rival on to the back foot. A breathtaking retrieve followed by a scintillating backhand pass gave the home favourite a triple breakpoint in the following game but the Croat, 66 tall, unleashed some of his big serves to extricate himself from the tight spot.         
	That was to be the pattern in the remainder of the match  Somdevs consistent ground-strokes forcing errors from Cilic, and the latter coming up with some of his best tennis at the crunch.         
	The statistics tell a story of their own.         
	Cilic blasted nine aces against his rivals one, but both had a poor first serve percentage  the Croat 51% and the Indian 57%. But the visitor won 81 of the total points, 10 more than Somdev. Cilic also averted nine of the 10 breakpoints he faced, while Somdev managed to save two of four. To sum up, Cilic was the better player on the day, however marginally.         
	The tenth game of the first set proved to be the turning point in the match. Having saved three more breakpoints in the seventh game, Cilic decided to turn the heat on Somdev who now had to serve to stay in the set.         
	The Croat changed strategy and chose to go up to the net, and the move put Somdev on the back foot. As it were, there were a few uncharacteristic unforced errors from the Indian and a double fault handed the set to Cilic.         
	Somdev was still recovering from the setback when Cilic broke him again to go 3-0 up in the second set. But what followed showed Somdevs mettle.         
	Whereas most of his compatriots have buckled in such circumstances, Somdev fought back toturn the tables on Cilic.         
	In the fifth game, Somdev pounced on Cilics serve with a stunning return to make it 30-40 and although the latter hung on, the notice had been served on him.         
	One more breakpoint in the ninth was fended before two more were forced in the 11th. This time, Cilic caved in.         
	But the Croat once again lifted his game. He started the tiebreak with an ace and Somdevs backhand error then gave him a 4-1 lead. That margin proved a bit too much for the Indian in the end.         
	After his victory, Cilic said of his final opponent that Somdev has the potential to break into the top 100 by the end of the season.         
	The Croatian world No.27 spoke highly of his opponent and reflected on the Indian tennis aces prospects. I would say he is going to be at least in the top 100 by the end of the year, looking at this tournament and the way he has been playing, Cilic said in the post-match press conference.         
	Meanwhile, the unseeded American pair of Eric Butorac and Rajeev Ram lifted the Chennai Open doubles title after defeating the Swiss pair of Jean-Claude Scherrer and Stanislas Wawrinka 6-3, 6-4.         
	The winners dropped only eight games before making the final and showed good understanding and co-ordination in downing Beijing Olympic champion Wawrinka and his partner.         
	They broke Scherrer/Wawrinka once each in the both the sets. The winners split a purse of $23,000 and also get 250 ranking points each. The runners-up will share $11,900 prize money and get 150 ranking points each.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Andrew Strauss wants discussion with Flintoff
                                                     Andrew Strauss wants discussion with Flintoff
                  Flintoff                     
	Nottingham: England captain Andrew Strauss said he wanted face-to-face talks with Andrew Flintoff over his decision to become a freelance cricketer, a move which somecricketers feel will encourage more players to follow in the footsteps of the all-rounder.         
	Flintoff, who chose the freedom of managing his own schedule over an England contract, found a supporter in his countrys Professional Cricketers Association (PCA) chief executive, Sean Morris, who said the Lancashire lad had to make the most of the small window left in his career.         
	However, it appears Strauss is still mystified by the all-rounders decision: I dont know the reason hes turned it down. I think we need to sit down and speak to him. Then well make an informed decision about what that means to his availability for England.         
	However, Strauss added: If Freddie is committed to playing for England, hes still a great asset in the shorter formats of the game.         
	Although currently sidelined following a knee surgery, the 31-year-old Flintoff  who insists he remains committed to Englands one-day cause  is reportedly a target for leading domestic teams in Australia and South Africa.         
	Flintoff, along with England teammate Kevin Pietersen, was the best paid player in this years IPL after drawing a winning bid of $1.55 million. Provided he regains fitness, Flintoff said he will be available for the one-day leg of Englands tour of Bangladesh in February and the World Twenty20 in West Indies while finding time for another stint with IPL side Chennai Super Kings in between.         
	Flintoffs career has been blighted by four operations on his ankle and two to his knee. However, Morris was confident Englands other star performer, Kevin Pietersen, would not be tempted to take a similar route.

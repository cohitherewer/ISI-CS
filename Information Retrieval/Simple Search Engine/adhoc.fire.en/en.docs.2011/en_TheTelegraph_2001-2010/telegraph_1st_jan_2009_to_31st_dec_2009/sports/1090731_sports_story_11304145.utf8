	Mumbai: The one clause about Wadas anti-doping code that has upset the Indian cricketers who have refused to sign it is termed whereabouts requirements.         
	The Wada states that they are a powerful deterrent and means of detecting doping by athletes. This specific rule is part of the international standard for testing and is mandatory for all signatories to the Code.         
	Accurate whereabouts information is crucial to ensure efficiency of the anti-doping programs, which are designed to protect the integrity of sport and to protect clean athletes, Wada said on their website.

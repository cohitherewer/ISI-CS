The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Security set-up is peeved with IPL
                                                     Security set-up is peeved with IPL
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Kolkata Knight Riders John Buchanan in the city on Saturday. A Telegraph picture Report on Page 18                           
	Calcutta: Theres resentment of sorts in the countrys security set-up over the Indian Premier League (IPL) not bothering to constitute a panel of experts from within.         
	Such a select group could, among other things, have been the consulting point for Nicholls Steyn amp; Associates, the South African company given charge of centrally overseeing arrangements during the T20 tournament.         
	The second edition, under a thick cloud because it coincides with the general elections, is (as of now) scheduled to be held between April 10-May 24.         
	Come Sunday, though, and the script may read rather differently.         
	Nobody from Nicholls Steyn amp; Associates knows India better than our own officers from the police or the armed forces What can the South Africans teach us? Moreover, no foreigner will be allowed to carry firearms The IPLs we-know-best attitude has definitely left much to be desired, a top source, based in New Delhi, told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Saturday evening, the gentleman added: The IPL couldve retained Nicholls Steyn amp; Associates and, at the same time, got them to coordinate with a panel of our officers, especially those whove dealt with issues of security during tours by cricket teams carrying a high risk         
	The impression created is that an overseas company is more aware about India and is best equipped to oversee security within our boundaries. That, let me tell you, is laughable.         
	Apparently, one of the eight franchise owners had even been reluctant to have a dialogue with the DGP of his state, saying Nicholls Steyn amp; Associates would take care of everything.         
	That angered many in the security set-up.         
	In the top sources view, the credentials of Nicholls Steyn amp; Associates arent all that hot either. Theyre the ones who gave the go-ahead for the 2008 Champions Trophy (in Pakistan), before the International Cricket Council backtracked after independent assessments by Australia and England gave a different picture Eventually, the tournament got postponed and has since been relocated to South Africa         
	Meanwhile, the post-Lahore attack move by Nicholls Steyn amp; Associates to procure bulletproof vehicles for the players (and officials) hasnt left everybody awe-struck.         
	Somebody pretty influential in the Board of Control for Cricket in India, which is promoting the IPL, said: The arrangement may sound impressive, but are the players also going to play in a bulletproof environment? They run the biggest risk when exposed on the park If you imagine the worst, nothing can protect them there Just how much of a difference would bulletproof vehicles alone make?         
	Instead, we need enough men, strategically placed, both at the ground and on the route to be taken... That has to be the No.1 priority and such deployment has to come from the government         
	Till a commitment towards that comes from all the staging centres (and theres confusion on that number as well), the IPL brass wont exactly be breathing easy.

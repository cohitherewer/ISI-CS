The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dinesh Karthik gets SOS
                                                     Dinesh Karthik gets SOS
    - Big question mark over Sehwag playing; dew to be a major factor             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Dinesh Karthik                                 
	Chandigarh: Dinesh Karthik was in New Delhi, preparing for the Tamil Nadu-Railways Ranji match from Tuesday, when the Board secretarys office asked him to join Team India as a standby.         
	That was at 2.30 pm on Sunday.         
	Right then, I didnt have the time to think of anything... The priority was to get here fast and thats what I did, Karthik told The Telegraph, around 7.30 pm, at the Taj, which has been swamped by security personnel and their Kalashnikovs.         
	Karthik did add, though: Its always nice to be back with the team...         
	The SOS went out once both Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir, whod been hit while batting and fielding, respectively, in the third ODI (on Saturday), became doubtful for Mondays match in neighbouring Mohali.         
	Had Virat Kohli not been in the XV for this series against Australia, the call wouldve been made to him.         
	As we speak, Sehwags left ankle is sore and Gambhir isnt able to turn his neck to the right side... The fear is that both could be in greater discomfort when they get up in the morning, is how a well-placed source put it.         
	Sehwag, it seems, is almost certain to be unavailable for selection.         
	The hosts are 2-1 up in the seven-match series against the World Cup and Champions Trophy holders, but injuries are keeping captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and coach Gary Kirsten on tenterhooks.         
	While Sehwag has just come off a long lay-off, Gambhir, too, is pretty injury-prone.         
	Significantly, a win in Mohali would take Team India back to the No.1 position in the ICCs ODI rankings. Heavy dew or not, theres much, then, to play for.         
	By the way, given the dew factor, neither Dhoni nor Ricky Ponting would like to bowl second.         
	It wasnt confirmed, but there was talk that Match Referee Chris Broad would be requested to allow mopping during every drinks break.         
	Understandably, much of the attention is bound to be on the one and only Sachin Tendulkar, who is no more than 47 runs away from getting to 17,000 in ODIs.         
	Just over a year ago, Sachin reached 12,000 Test runs at the same venue. Against the same team as well.         
	Not that the in-form Yuvraj Singh is going to lack support either. After all, hes a Chandigarh da puttar.         
	Or, sher, if you like.         
	A full house is, of course, expected at the PCA Stadium. It has probably helped that Monday is a public holiday.         
	The teams landed here late in the afternoon. The timing of their arrival didnt, however, upset plans of practising as no session had been scheduled for Sunday.         
	Match starts: 2.30 pm.

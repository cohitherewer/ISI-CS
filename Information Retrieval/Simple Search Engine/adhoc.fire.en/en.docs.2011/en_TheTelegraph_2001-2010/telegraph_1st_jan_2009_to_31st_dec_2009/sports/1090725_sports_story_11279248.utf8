The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Arktouros has the edge
                                                                                                               Arktouros has the edge 
            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Less-fancied horses may, once again, have their say in Saturdays six-event card. Form is yet to settle and it may take another week or two before smiles return on the faces. Big stables are expected to get into the serious business around that time.           
	However, jockey C. Alford is the one who could be followed on the day. The champion jockey rides trainer Vijay Singhs Arnatta in the True Colours Handicap. The four-year-old returns to the happy hunting ground following her poor performance in the winter classics.           
	Vijays Arktouros is another one who may help Alford win the feature event, the 1,200m Bhishma Cup. The Diffident son just needs to beat trainer Patrick Quinns Samarkhand. In past, the two horses have fought close battles on similar terms but now the age factor may favour the four-year-old Arktouros.

	Arktouros: Although it a toss up between Arktouros and Samarkhand, the former is fancied in view of his young age. Samarkhand: May upset.

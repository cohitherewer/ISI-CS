The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Must-win match for the Kings XI
                                                   Must-win match for the Kings XI
                      
	Bloemfontein: The Delhi DareDevils, having already secured a place in the semi-finals after their thrilling 12-run win over the Deccan Chargers on Wednesday, would be keen to continue the good work when they take on a desperate Kings XI Punjab in their Indian Premier League match here on Friday.         
	If the DareDevils are on a high after becoming the first team to qualify for the last four stage with 16 points from 10 matches, the Punjab side have been laid low by some rather inconsistent performances.         
	The Yuvraj Singh-led side desperately need a victory against the marauding DareDevils if they hope to make it to the semi-finals but doing so will be one huge task given the rich vein of form that the Delhi side are going through.         
	The Kings XI need to pull out something special and one man who can help them do that is captain Yuvraj himself. He has had a rather sedate tournament so far and is long overdue a big score.         
	The others too need to chip in and if their last encounter against the Mumbai Indians is anything to go by, then a lot need to be done in their batting department.         
	To make matters worse, Mahela Jayawardenes hamstring injury still remains a matter of concern for the Punjab side. The Sri Lankan didnt feature in the last match after sustaining the injury against the Chargers on May 9.         
	The bowling has improved with Brett Lees arrival but lacks the bite despite the presence of left-arm pacers Yusuf Abdulla and Irfan Pathan.         
	Sreesanth has been a big disappointment for the Kings XI, as the right-arm pacer has scalped just one wicket from his three outings conceding huge runs.         
	The Kings XI bowling will be tested to the limit against a formidable DareDevils batting line-up that boasts the likes of Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, David Warner, AB de Villiers, Tillekaratne Dilshan and Dinesh Karthik. All of them are in fine form and the best part of DareDevils batting is that even if one fails, the rest are there to shoulder the burden.

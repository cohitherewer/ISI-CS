The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal slump to second loss
                                                   Bengal slump to second loss
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Dhanbad: Hosts Jharkhand produced an all-round performance to secure their second victory on the trot and inflict on defending champions Bengal the embarrassment of consecutive defeats in the East Zone T20 tournament at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium Thursday. Seven wickets the margin of Bengals loss this time.         
	Defeat at the hands of Jharkhand, who have eight points from two matches, means Bengal run the danger of failing to qualify for the inter-state championships. The defending champions have no points to show for their two outings and only the top two teams from each of the five zones will feature in the national meet.         
	Jharkhand won the toss and invited Bengal to bat. Bengal made a modest start with openers Wriddhiman Saha and Deep Dasgupta scoring 15 and 10 respectively.         
	The visitors failed to increase the run rate as they kept losing wickets at intervals and put up a laboured total of 95 runs for the loss of seven wickets.         
	Assam win         
	In another match, in Dhanbad Assam beat Tripura by eight runs in the East Zone T20 tournament at the Tata Diwadih stadium on Thursday.

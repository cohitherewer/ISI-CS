The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pak board followed Mani advice
                                                   Pak board followed Mani advice
                      
	Karachi: Former International Cricket Council (ICC) president Ehsan Mani was the brain behind the Pakistan Cricket Boards (PCB) legal challenge to the ICC on the decision to move the 2011 World Cup matches from the country, media reports said Sunday.         
	(Ejaz) Butt held several meetings with Mani after the decision to shift the World Cup matches was taken by the ICC, and it was Mani who suggested that the PCB should not allow the matter to be dead, one report said.         
	Mani gave the advice to PCB chairman Butt during meetings in Dubai and Abu Dhabi recently.         
	Mani told the PCB that the ICC decision could be challenged legally as it was flawed on many counts. Mani advised Butt to seek the services of the London-based law firm, Mark Gay and DFL Piper and send the notice to the ICC, the report said.

                                                     Subrata: Rediscovery of the net prophet
    - The day after 
  -  India goalkeeper Paul is the cynosure             ANSHUMAN ROY            Subrata Paul with national coach Bob Houghton after their Nehru Cup win in New Delhi on Monday                                 
	Calcutta: It was a muggy late afternoon six years back at the Tata Football Academy in Jamshedpur. The India under-19 team, fresh from their Milk Cup win, was going through the paces under the watchful eye of Stephen Constantine.         
	Suddenly a centre came into the box and Gourmangi Singh and the goalkeeper jumped in tandem. There was brief contact and the goalkeeper rushed to Gourmangi animatedly. The then TFA assistant coach Carlton Chapman and Constantine had to intervene to prevent the rookies from getting into a tussle. Dont get so involved. Its just a practice session, was Chapmans advice to the youngster and the goalkeeper nodded. I like this guy. He has an attitude. A must for every goalkeeper, Chapman and Constantine had said later.         
	Well this guy with an attitude now is Indias latest hero and responds to the name of Subrata Paul. His three saves against Syria in the tiebreak saw India retain the Nehru Cup. And for change it was a goalkeeper, and not Bhaichung Bhutia, whose photo was splashed on the front pages of newspapers across the country. Even someone with an elephantine memory will find that difficult to recall.         
	How life changes in such a short span? Just a few months back, during an I-League match at the Barasat Stadium, Subrata faced a barrage of expletives from the East Bengal fans after letting in a soft goal.         
	New coach Subhas Bhowmick took him off and brought on Abhra Mondal. Humiliated and pushed to the corner, Subrata decided to pack his bags and this season he has been roped in by the newly-promoted Pune FC. There were questions about his temperament. He is only good for the country, it was said.         
	Away from the glare, Subrata went back to the basics and, helped by his sir Debasish Mukherjee, he prepared himself for the India camp in Dubai and Barcelona.         
	Apart from Mukherjee, there was another man who never doubted his talent. National coach Bob Houghton refused to believe that Subrata was finished. Confidence was restored when he got maximum exposure during the practice matches in Barcelona. From the third match (against CE Europa) itself I started getting that feel. The feel of the ball coming on nicely to my grip, Paul told The Telegraph on Tuesday.         
	What does he make of this sudden adulation? (He couldnt catch up on sleep since there was an early morning flight to catch and bleary-eyed he was obliging TV news channels and the quote-hungry newspapers)         
	You know its been a roller coaster ride for me ever since I started playing football. And every time they write me off I come back with a bang. It doesnt affect me anymore, he says.         
	Indeed its been a roller coaster ride for this 23-year-old goalkeeper.         
	From the Cristiano Junior episode to Amal Dutta accusing him of match-fixing  he let in four goals during an IFA Shield match between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan and the green and maroon brigade did not lose a minute in finding a scapegoat  to the recent allegations of attitude problems, at such an young age, Paul has seen more than any of his peers.         
	The Junior episode  the Brazilian died after a collision with Subrata during the Federation Cup final between Dempo and Bagan in Bangalore in 2004  saw him being banned by the AIFF for two months. Indeed, such was the uproar that his parents wanted him to leave the game. But then he was pursuing a dream, a dream of being Indias No.1 goalkeeper. The dream of donning the national jersey. And no one could have stopped him from that.         
	He has an amazing ability to bounce back, national skipper Bhaichung Bhutia had said in Barcelona last month. May be because of this ability Houghton is so fond of this TFA cadet.         
	On Tuesday, when Paul was told how his Bob sir had praised him, Subrata could not believe it. Bob sir said? Bob sir? he asked as if to confirm. I am indebted to him and sir (Debasish Mukherjee). At least they didnt lose faith in me when I was down in the dumps.         
	The FC Barcelona fan, who adores Oliver Kahn, said that during a penalty shoot-out its easier for the goalkeeper to handle the pressure than the penalty taker. Goalkeepers have nothing to lose. The guy who is taking the shot always feels the pressure.         
	I just followed the ball on Monday. The first save was crucial as it gave the confidence for the second. The third one was more of an impact, he continued.         
	Yes, it made a huge impact. It helped us rediscover a goalkeeper who till the other day met with ridicule at every step.  
	quote-shoot  
	Subrata Paul has been at the centre of a lsquo;club versus country rsquo; debate of his own mdash; whether the talismanic goalie is good both for club and country or whether he is at his best only in an India shirt. However, he has redeemed himself with Monday rsquo;s tiebreak heroics. He is not the one saying this. It is the veterans of the game who are hailing a great comeback.  
	Following are what some of them said (alphabetically):   
	Shibaji Banerjee, former Mohun Bagan rsquo;keeper: Great show. He made a fairytale comeback. His records say he is good for the country as well as for the club.  
	Subhas Bhowmick, Paul rsquo;s coach at East Bengal, last season: Yeah, he is India No.1. But his form for East Bengal was not up to the mark. I wish him all the best with his new club.  
	Bob Houghton, national coach: The whole Barcelona trip paid off. An amazing performance by Subrata. I don rsquo;t care about this debate that he is good for the country, bad for the club. He once again proved how rotten the system is in Calcutta.   
	Debasish Mukherjee, mentor and former India international: A perfect answer to his critics. He has the talent and I had full faith in him. Before the camp began, he was with me for a month-and-a-half. That gave him the confidence. Good for country, bad for club is nonsense. When you are good, you are good. When you are bad, you are bad. As simple as that.  
	Brahmanand Shanwalkar, former India international: He was good throughout the tournament hellip; Fantastic performance. Goalkeepers are to be treated in a different way. I think most coaches in India do not know how to handle a goalkeeper. Hopefully Paul will have a better future at Pune FC.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis Khan bats for Akhtar, Afridi
                                                   Younis Khan bats for Akhtar, Afridi
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan captain Younis Khan has backed senior players Shoaib Akhtar and Shahid Afridi to fire in next months ICC World Twenty20 Championship and said he was satisfied with the duos performance in the just-concluded one-day series against Australia.         
	People are criticising Shoaibs performance but the good thing is he is gradually returning to form and fitness and he took part in five of the six matches, Younis said.         
	With just three wickets in four ODIs in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, Akhtar continues to remain a target for critics and some former players.         
	Younis, though, said he was happy that Akhtar had tried and worked hard in the series and was hopeful he would deliver better performance in the T20 World Cup in England. He can be a handful in English conditions, the skipper said.         
	Younis also pointed out that Afridi had surprised everyone with his performance. I have told him he has so much talent that instead of scoring just 30 or 40 runs, he should be converting them into centuries. He is an extraordinarily talented player, Younis said.

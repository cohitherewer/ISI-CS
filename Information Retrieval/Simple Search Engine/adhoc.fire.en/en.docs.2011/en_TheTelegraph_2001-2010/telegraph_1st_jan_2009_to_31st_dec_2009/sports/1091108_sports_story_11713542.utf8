                                                                                                                                     Shukla hails team effort
            A STAFF REPORTER            Ranadeb Bose, Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Manoj Tiwary on their return to the city on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Bengal skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla feels that the seven-wicket win over Maharashtra in their Ranji Trophy opener will keep the critics mouth shut for the time being.         
	We were ridiculed after the East Zone Twenty20 debacle. People said there were differences in the team, which was not true. Now that we have won this match, and that too in a resounding way, people are hailing the team spirit, Shukla said.         
	Shukla said he had a feeling that Bengal would achieve victory the moment Maharashtra were dismissed for 179 on the opening day. The pitch was not that bad. But Ranadeb (Bose) was simply superb and (Ashok) Dinda also gave him good support, he said.         
	According to Shukla, everyone played a role in the victory. Difficult to single out anyone in particular If Ranadeb, Dinda, and Sourasish (Lahiri) bowled well then Manoj (Tiwary), Avishek (Jhunjhunwala) and Wriddhiman (Saha) shone with the bat. It was a team effort, he said.         
	Shukla, though, is not worried about his own form and also that of Rohan Gavaskar. We got starts but could not convert them. But then everyone will not in perform in every match. You can have a bad day. I am sure against Baroda (Bengals next opponents in the Ranji Trophy which starts from Tuesday at the Eden) we will come good, he said.         
	About Sourav Gangulys induction in the Bengal team, he said: Its a bonus. He is a player who can still be the decisive factor. His presence will give us the advantage. His understanding of the game will be of great help, he said.         
	Shukla also said that the team will be missing Tiwary, Saha and Dinda who will be busy doing duty for the Board Presidents XI against the visiting Sri Lankan side in Mumbai from November 11. We will definitely miss them. But Sourav will be there. So we wont be badly handicapped, he said.

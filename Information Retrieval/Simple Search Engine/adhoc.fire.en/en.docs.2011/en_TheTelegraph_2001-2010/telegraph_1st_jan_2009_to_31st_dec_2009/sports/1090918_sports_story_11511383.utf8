                                                     England face tough target
                  Tim Paine after his century on Thursday                     
	Nottingham: Tim Paine scored his first one-day International century as Australia made 296 for eight against England on Thursday to bolster their chances of a sixth victory in a row.                     
	At midnight, England were 42/1 in 10 overs. Joe Denly (24) and Ravi Bopara (16) were at the crease                     
	The Aussie wicket-keeper and one-day opener scored 111, reaching his century off 130 balls at Trent Bridge and hitting 14 fours and a six. He shared a third wicket partnership of 164 with Mike Hussey whose 65 included two sixes.         
	The Australians won the toss for the first time in the series and decided to bat first under cloudy skies. They lost opener Shane Watson for 4 and captain Ricky Ponting for 6, both falling to James Anderson.         
	But Paine and Hussey moved Australia from 40 for two to 203 before Hussey was caught just inside the boundary. Paine followed three runs later in a similar way and Callum Ferguson made only 6 before he was bowled by Anderson.         
	Cameron White and James Hopes raced to a partnership of 53 off 27 balls before White lofted a catch to Joe Denly and Anderson collected his fourth wicket to finish with four for 55.         
	The England paceman then ran out Brett Lee for nought and Hopes was caught for 38 in Australias late flurry of runs.         
	England bowler Stuart Broad was ruled out of the game as well as Sundays final match at Durham with a knee injury but hopes to be fit for the Champions Trophy which starts in South Africa next week.         
	Injured Stuart Broad was replaced by Anderson and England recalled off-spinner Graeme Swann in place of leg-spinner Adil Rashid.           (AP)

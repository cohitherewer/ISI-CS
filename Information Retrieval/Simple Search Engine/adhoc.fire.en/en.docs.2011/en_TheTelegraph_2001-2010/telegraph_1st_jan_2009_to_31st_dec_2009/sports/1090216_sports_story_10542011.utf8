                                                   Goof-up costs Das a place
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal batsman Debabrata Das had to sit out of the National one-dayer against Jharkhand on Sunday owing to a miscommunication between the Bengal selectors and the team management, including Laxmi Ratan Shukla.         
	In the morning, Shukla handed over a players list comprising 10 players to team manager Sujan Mukherjee before the toss. When Mukherjee asked about the 11th member, Shukla proposed Abhishek Banerjees name.         
	But later on, when the final XI was tallied with the list given by the selectors, it was discovered that Debabrata Dass name was missing. Sourav Sarkar, who played Sunday, was also not the selectors choice. It happened because of a miscommunication, Mukherjee said.         
	The team management requested Jharkhand coach Kajal Das to let Bengal include Debabrata in the playing XI.         
	The Jharkhand coach declined and said nothing can be done.         
	Learning about the mistake, Sambaran Banerjee, the Bengal chief selector, informed the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Jagmohan Dalmiya that it was not the team chosen by the selectors.         
	It was not the final XI that we had selected We had Debabrata in the team and there was no Sourav Sarkar, Banerjee said.         
	Captain Shukla said that the situation could have been avoided had the Jharkhand coach shown some sportsman spirit.         
	CAB joint secretary Arun Mitra promised to investigate the issue.

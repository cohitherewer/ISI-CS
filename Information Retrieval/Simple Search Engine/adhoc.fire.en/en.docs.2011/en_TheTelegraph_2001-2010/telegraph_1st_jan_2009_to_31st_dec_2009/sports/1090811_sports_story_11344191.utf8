            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sania Mirza couldnt lay her hands on the title at the Vancouver Open but her run at the ITF event, where she lost in the final to Stephanie Dubois of Canada, has seen her gain nine places to rise to No.74 on the WTA singles chart released Monday.         
	On the doubles chart Sania held onto the No.49 spot.         
	Somdev Dev Varman, the highest-ranked Indian on the ATP table, was at No.140. The improvement of 13 places comes on the back of some impressive performances at the Washington Classic.         
	Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi saw no movement on the ATP doubles chart and were at No.6 and No.9 respectively.         
	Roger Federer and Dinara Safina continue to reign at the top of the mens and the womens charts respectively.

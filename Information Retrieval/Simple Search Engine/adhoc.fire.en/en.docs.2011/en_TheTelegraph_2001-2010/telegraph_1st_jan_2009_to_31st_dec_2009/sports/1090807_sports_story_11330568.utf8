                                                     Australia have momentum: Ricky
          
	Leeds: Australia have the momentum going into the fourth Ashes Test of a fluctuating series, their captain Ricky Ponting said on Thursday.         
	Australia batted through the final day of the last Test at Edgbaston to salvage a draw and remain just 0-1 down to England with two matches left starting at Headingley on Friday.         
	The momentum has swung throughout the series and the way we batted in the second innings at Edgbaston has left a really positive feeling around our group, Ponting told a news conference on Thursday. This is a massive game for all of us. Expect us to come out and play well tomorrow.         
	Ponting said Australia still had a few minor injury concerns, including in-form batsman Michael Clarke who did not train on Wednesday due to a stomach injury.         
	Knowing the sort of bloke he is I wouldnt read too much into that, Ponting said.         
	Wicketkeeper Brad Haddin missed the last Test with a finger injury but Ponting said he might be fit to play at Headingley.         
	It was good to see Brad with the gloves on again and he had a good hit-out with the bat as well, Ponting said. Well have another look at him this afternoon.         
	Ponting said seamers Stuart Clark and Brett Lee would come into consideration to freshen up the touring sides attack.(REUTERS)

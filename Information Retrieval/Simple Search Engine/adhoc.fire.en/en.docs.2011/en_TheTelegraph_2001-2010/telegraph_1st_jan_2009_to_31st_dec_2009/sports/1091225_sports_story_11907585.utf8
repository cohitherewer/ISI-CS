The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Good we finished it off here, says Sehwag
                                                                                                                       7                                      Good we finished it off here, says Sehwag
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Stand-in captain Virender Sehwag and the days highest scorer Gautam Gambhir spoke highly of a strong bench that is yielding such good results for Team India.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Wrapping up the series         
	Sehwag: Obviously it feels great to win the series in Calcutta. Now we can travel to Delhi with a free mind. We always knew that the Eden strip primarily helps batsmen. We dont know how the Delhi wicket will behave. So, its good that we finished it off here         
	Delhi, the powerhouse of Indian batting         
	Sehwag: You definitely feel proud as Delhi boys are doing well at the international level. They are known for their hunger for runs in the domestic arena When they come up at the international level, they are eager to replicate that form. Gautam and myself have done that and now its good to find Virat doing the same thing.         
	Gambhirs finishing act         
	Gambhir: I am extremely happy to have gone on to finish the match for my team. I have had good innings in the past but was unable to finish it off. This is the first time in the 90 matches I have played so far that I have gone on to finish the match.         
	Losing early wickets         
	Gambhir: I knew that one good partnership would bring us right back into the match. Dew was an important factor as the ball was getting wet. We also knew that once we required 120-130 runs, it would no longer be a difficult chase because we had wickets in hand. I was telling Virat that we should just keep going and wait for the loose deliveries. He batted exceptionally well.         
	Sehwag: The thought of losing never crossed my mind. I knew that if Gautam and Virat were around for 10 overs we would win. When the ball gets wet due to dew there would be no swing, seam or spin. The bowlers will find it difficult to grip the ball and scoring runs would be easy.         
	Virats innings a show of bench strength         
	Gambhir: It is true that we have fantastic bench strength now. Its always nice to have the likes of (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni and Yuvi (Yuvraj Singh) around but we have the players to ensure we dont feel their absence. Virat came in place of Yuvraj and got a 100, which shows his character. He has played a lot of domestic cricket and has got the experience to do well at this level. Similarly, when I came in (to the national team), I had had enough experience in domestic cricket and wanted to perform at the international level.         
	Sehwag: Its good that he has used the opportunity to get a 100. Also, there was an experienced player like Gautam to guide him during their long partnership. Since we have less than two years left for the 2011 World Cup, its good to see the youngsters coming up. Before the next World Cup, players like Virat, Ravindra Jadeja, Suresh Raina will all play another 80-90 ODIs, which will give them enough experience for the big tournament.         
	Bowling still a worry         
	Sehwag: I dont think our bowlers are bowling badly. I would rather give credit to the Sri Lankan batsmen who have really batted well in the series.

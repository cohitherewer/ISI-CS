The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Country, not IPL: Ponting
                                                                                                                                     Country, not IPL: Ponting

	Melbourne: Australia captain Ricky Ponting has advised the national team youngsters to get their priorities right and choose country over the cash offered by the Indian Premier League and the Champions League T20.         
	The quartet of Clint McKay, Burt Cockley, Jon Holland and Moises Henriques have appeared in the inaugural Champions League T20 with the New South Wales Blues and the Victoria Bushrangers but Ponting hopes representing the country becomes an addiction for the youngsters.         
	Ive made no secret that Im a bit worried about the attitude of some of the younger players with the amount of money thats around in the Champions League and the IPL, Ponting said.         
	Ive made it common knowledge over the last couple of years that the next generation of players should have the same sort of want and desire to play as much international cricket as I have. Thats what its all about as far as Im concerned, Ponting, who retired from international T20s to play more Tests and ODIs, was quoted as saying by an Australian daily.         
	However, Ponting doesnt want young players to think that the hard work stops with their first big payday.

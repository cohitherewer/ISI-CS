The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its all in Darrens genes
                                                   Its all in Darrens genes
                      
	Port of Spain: Legendary West Indies batsman Brian Laras reflection in compatriot Darren Bravo is not a coincidence or a conscious effort on the youngsters part to copy the former captain but its all in their genes.         
	Bravo, who made his international debut against India in the on-going four-match one-day series, is actually Laras nephew, said his mother Earlene Bravo. Brians (Lara) mother is my fathers sister. So we are first cousins, Earlene was quoted as saying in the media. From the time he was young, he had those antics just like Brian Its in his genes.         
	I was on a taxi in Jamaica on the way to the ground and the guy didnt know who I was. Darren (Bravo) was just going out to bat and the guy kept saying Why this guy trying to be like Lara? and I was so annoyed, she added.         
	Earlene said Darren, the step-brother of Dwayne Bravo, was passionate about the game from his childhood. From a very young age this boy just loved cricket. He would be batting in his sleep. On mornings he pretended he was playing a match with himself. (PTI)

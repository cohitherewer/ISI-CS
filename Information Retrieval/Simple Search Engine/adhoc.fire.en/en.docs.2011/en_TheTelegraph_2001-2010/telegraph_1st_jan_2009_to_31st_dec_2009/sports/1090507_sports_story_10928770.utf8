	I face problems against fast bowling. I fail to react quickly and get in line of the ball. Please help.         
	(Sarbojit Sen, 13, Calcutta-20)         
	Watch the ball coming out of the bowlers hand early and try and move back and across a little early so that you have that extra bit of time.         
	I am a right-handed batsman. I often fall to balls that keep low. I just fail to bring my bat down in time. Please help.         
	(Dibyendu Saha, 19, Calcutta-21)         
	Maintain the flex in the knees. Dont be too upright and keep an eye on your back lift.         
	I am a right-handed batsman. I often fail to negotiate the bouncer. I lose my balance and am dismissed hit wicket. I tried to make amends by standing outside the crease but it hasnt helped. Please help.         
	(Susovan Saha, 19, Calcutta-22)         
	Instead of standing forward, use the depth of the crease to go back and give yourself more time.         
	I am a right-handed batsman. I always fail to read my off stump while facing fast bowlers. Please help.         
	(Soumen Datta, 14, Siliguri)         
	Check your guard. Try asking for a middle stump guard.         
	I am a left-handed batsman. I face problems while facing a leg spinner. Please help.         
	(Soham Roy, 17, Calcutta)         
	Work on your footwork and watch the ball closely.         
	I am a right-arm medium-pacer. Despite my best efforts, I fail to bowl the outswinger. Please help.         
	(Debarshi Mukherjee, 16, Calcutta-42)         
	Work on your grip and your action at the time of delivery.         
	I am a right-handed batsman and usually get bowled when the ball is pitched on the leg stump. Is something wrong with my stance?         
	(Aritra Gupta, 15, Birbhum)         
	You are either too upright or having a big backlift or playing across the line of the ball.         
	Despite getting to the pitch of the ball, my off drives often land in the hands of the cover fielder. Why does this happen?         
	(Swapan Gupta, 25, Guwahati)         
	Let your weight go into the shot and make sure your head is down.         
	Whenever I try to step out against an off-spinner, I get bowled or stumped. Please help.         
	(Ayan Chaturvedi, 17, Guwahati)         
	Choose the right ball to step out to and dont commit yourself too early.         
	How can I improve my ground fielding?         
	(Subhra, 19, Calcutta-40)         
	Its something that you got to enjoy and practice like crazy. Also work on your agility.

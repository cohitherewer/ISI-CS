	Rome: The Indians had a good day at the Rome Masters on Thursday with both Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi advancing to the next round with their respective partners. Third-seeded Paes and his Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy didnt have to break too much sweat against the duo of Croatian Ivo Karlovic and Serbian Dusan Vemic.         
	Paes and Dlouhy won 6-1, 6-1 in only 49 minutes in their second round match. Bhupathi and his Bahamian partner Mark Knowles, seeded fourth, had a tough outing against the Italian pair of Simon Bolelli and Adreas Seppi. The Indo-Bahamian duo won 7-6 (7-5), 2-6, 10-3.         
	In singles, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic both advanced to the quarter finals with routine straight-set wins.         
	Federer avenged last years quarter final loss to Radek Stepanek by beating the 16th-seeded Czech player 6-4, 6-1.         
	Djokovic had an even easier time with 13th-seeded Tommy Robredo, winning 6-1, 6-1.         
	Also advancing were No. 5 Juan Martin del Potro, No. 12 Fernando Gonzalez, and Argentine qualifier Juan Monaco.         
	Federer jumped out to a 3-0 lead before being broken when he served for the first set at 5-3. But the newlywed Swiss player broke right back when he forced Stepanek to hit a low volley that landed in the net.

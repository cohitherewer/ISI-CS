The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dempo hit back hard 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dempo hit back hard 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Dempo Sports Club on Wednesday decided to hit back at the All India Football Federation (AIFF) asking the parent body to analyse and verify the problems faced by the clubs and the players rather than jumping hastily to illogical conclusion.         
	In a three-page reply to the AIFF show cause notice for not releasing Mahesh Gawli and Sameer Naik for the ongoing national camp in Goa, the Dempo coach and secretary, Armando Colaco not only justified the clubs decision but also accused the federation of wrongly treating the national players.         
	Without naming Bob Houghton, the Goa club also accused the national coach of forcing Sunil Chetri to play for the national team even though the striker was not fully fit.         
	Pointing out that both Gawli and Naik were seriously injured, the Dempo letter said: Nowhere in the world players who are medically unfit and who have not played competitive matches for their clubs are selected for the national camp.         
	Taking a dig at the management of the national team, Armando Colaco pointed out how an injured Naik and Clifford Miranda were not selected for the India team for the last Nehru Cup and were still kept back in Delhi thus denying both of them the opportunity to return to the club team.         
	Players at the camp did not go through proper medical procedure is altogether a different story but Sameer Naik was forced to practice despite the injury, the letter said.

	Kuala Lumpur: Jyoti Randhawa came agonisingly close to an eighth career title only to settle for a share of the second place after American Anthony Kang pipped him at the post in the Maybank Malaysian Open golf tournament here Sunday.         
	Randhawa signed off with a sensational six-under 66 to finish just one shot behind Kang who ended an eight-year title drought with a five-under 67 that gave him a winning total of 17-under 271.         
	Kang in fact bogeyed the 15th hole to slip back into a share of the lead in the $2 million event sanctioned by the Asian and the European Tours but produced a majestic birdie on the final 18th hole to overcome the challenges of Randhawa, Prayad Marksaeng, David Horsey and Miles Tunnicliff who shared the second spot at 16-under 272.         
	Randhawa shot up the leaderboard in style but fell one short in the end. He needed to hole a 50-foot eagle on the last stroke to get to 17-under but came up short.         
	I had to shoot around eight-under to win but I came close. I needed to make birdies coming in but I was happy. Anthony played great, he deserves it, said the Indian.         
	It was a sizzling round by the Indian who got off with a birdie hattrick and reeled off five more birdies on his back-nine, but a pair of bogeys on his way back eventually scuttled his title hopes.         
	Compatriot Shiv Kapur (279), who came into the final round at tied eighth, completely lost the plot Sunday and turned in a two-over 74, his worst card of the week, to finish tied 21st.         
	S.S.P. Chowrasia (291) also went over-par and signed off with one-over 73 to finish tied 69th. (PTI)

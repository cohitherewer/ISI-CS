The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger Woods statement
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tiger Woods statement
                      
	I have let my family down and I regret those transgressions with all of my heart. I have not been true to my values and the behaviour my family deserves. I am not without faults and I am far short of perfect. I am dealing with my behaviour and personal failings behind closed doors with my family. Those feelings should be shared by us alone.         
	Although I am a well-known person and have made my career as a professional athlete, I have been dismayed to realise the full extent of what tabloid scrutiny really means.         
	For the last week, my family and I have been hounded to expose intimate details of our personal lives. The stories in particular that physical violence played any role in the car accident were utterly false and malicious.         
	Elin has always done more to support our family and shown more grace than anyone could possibly expect.         
	But no matter how intense curiosity about public figures can be, there is an important and deep principle at stake which is the right to some simple, human measure of privacy.         
	I realise there are some who dont share my view on that. But for me, the virtue of privacy is one that must be protected in matters that are intimate and within ones own family. Personal sins should not require press releases and problems within a family shouldnt have to mean public confessions.         
	Whatever regrets I have about letting my family down have been shared with and felt by us alone. I have given this a lot of reflection and thought and I believe that there is a point at which I must stick to that principle even though its difficult.         
	I will strive to be a better person and the husband and father that my family deserves. For all of those who have supported me over the years, I offer my profound apology.

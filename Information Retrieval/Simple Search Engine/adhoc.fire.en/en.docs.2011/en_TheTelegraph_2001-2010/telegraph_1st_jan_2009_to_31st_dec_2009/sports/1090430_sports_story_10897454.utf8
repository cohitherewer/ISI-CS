The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kings XI win a humdinger
                                                   Kings XI win a humdinger
                                Sangakkara    
	Durban: A spirited effort by the Kings XI Punjab bowlers made up for the frailties of their batting colleagues as the Mohali-based outfit edged out the Mumbai Indians by three runs in a low-scoring thriller in the Indian Premier League here on Wednesday.         
	Chasing 120 to win, the Mumbai Indians managed 116 for seven. JP Duminy top scored for the Mumbai side with a 63-ball 59.         
	Earlier, Kumar Sangakkaras unbeaten 45 saved Kings XI the blushes as the side fumbled and faltered on their way to 119 for eight wickets in the stipulated 20 overs.         
	For the Mumbai side, the first 19 balls yielded only 12 runs while costing them the wickets of Sanath Jayasuriya (0), Sachin Tendulkar (1) and Shikhar Dhawan (3).         
	Irfan Pathan had Jayasuriya caught in the slip with his first legitimate delivery and in the next over, Vikramjeet Malik silenced the stadium when Mahela Jayawardene caught Tendulkar at point.         
	Not to be left behind, the in-form Yusuf Abdulla trapped Dhawan plumb in front with a toe-crusher and at 12 for three, things looked far from rosy for Tendulkars side.         
	Dwayne Bravo (15) put up a brief resistance before Ramesh Powar got rid of him.         
	Earlier, barring Sangakkara, none of the Kings XI Punjab batsmen could make their presence felt.         
	Sangakkara waged a gritty battle with a 44-ball 45 on a day when only three of his teammates managed double digit scores.         
	Yuvraj Singhs decision to bat first backfired and by the first strategy break, the Punjab side crawled to 50 in 10 overs with three top order batsmen, including the captain himself, already dismissed.

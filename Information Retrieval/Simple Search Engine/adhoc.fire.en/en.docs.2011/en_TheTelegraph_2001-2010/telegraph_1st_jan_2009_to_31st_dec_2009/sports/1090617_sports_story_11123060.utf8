    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  Former India captain on the hot seat             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  
	Nottingham: Former India captain (and the third most successful bowler in Test cricket) Anil Kumble, who completes his innings as a TV commentator in the World T20, on Tuesday, spoke to The Telegraph on captaincy.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q To talk of the recent IPL, your leadership stood out, helping take the Royal Challengers Bangalore to the final...         
	A After Kevin Pietersen left, (coach) Ray Jennings asked me if I would like to captain and I said I was game...         
	Having been an India captain, how different was the experience of leading a franchise?         
	It was very challenging and it was different, but Ive always loved challenges... I knew what I was getting into, but dont think I did anything different as captain... The team rallied around me and we were determined not to disappoint like last year (finishing seventh). The inaugural edition had left us gutted.         
	Bottomline is that everybody responded...         
	They did, yes, and we deserved to win this time. We had 80 per cent of the final (against the Deccan Chargers) under control, but...         
	Who will be the Bangalore captain in the Champions League and in IPL 2010?         
	Dont know... I havent had a chat with the owner (Vijay Mallya)... Im committed to playing for the franchise till next year.         
	Circumstances ensured that you could captain India for no more than a year... Eight months after retiring from international cricket, how do you look back on that period?         
	Its not a regret that I didnt get the captaincy before November 2007... It would be a regret if being captain or not being one was in my control and I hadnt done what needed to be done... The people who mattered had to choose and it wasnt necessary for me to put up my hand and say I want to captain... I might not have spoken about it, but my actions would have shown that I loved any responsibility...         
	Did you enjoy the captaincy?         
	I did and I knew it was a period of transition... We didnt have a full-time coach then and, among other things, I had to try and ease Gary Kirsten into that job.         
	Was the Sydney Test (January 2008) and the days immediately after the Harbhajan Singh-Andrew Symonds row there the most challenging period for you?         
	It was... We had to come out of it and play good cricket, show our skills on the field... Being the captain, it was my duty to motivate the players. As you know, we bounced back to win big in Perth (third Test of the four-match series).         
	What did you learn in the period that you were the India captain?         
	That the respect an Indian captain gets is huge...         
	Biggest disappointment?         
	Not being able to save the Sydney Test... A couple of decisions went against us on the final day... In fact, we could have won it.         
	Having been around for 17 years, when you got the top job, you knew what captaincy was all about. But what was it like when you actually sat in the chair?         
	Realised that a captain has much less time for himself... There are commitments, like addressing the media before and after a match, which have to be met...         
	What are the qualities required for a good captain?         
	He has to be a good communicator... He has to lead from the front... He should be able to motivate his players to give that 100 per cent all the time.         
	You had three former captains (Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid) in your team. Did you have to deal with them differently?         
	Wasnt an issue at all... The team needed to collectively step up and everybody played his part... (After a pause) It was under Sourav that we started to believe that we could win overseas and, under my captaincy, we needed to take that forward.         
	The toughest decision you took...         
	Having convinced the selectors to pick (Virender) Sehwag, who hadnt been part of the probables for the Australia tour, and then not being able to play him in the first two Tests... I couldnt because Yuvraj (Singh) had done so well in the last Test before we set out for Australia... That was a tough call... I got Rahul to open which, looking back, wasnt the best compromise...         
	How is Mahendra Singh Dhoni shaping as captain?         
	Really well... He has a cool head... He also has such a fine support staff --- Gary and the specialist coaches (Venkatesh Prasad, Robin Singh)...         
	But would you have done a Dhoni and led a unity parade before the media?         
	Im not aware of the background, so I wouldnt like to comment.         
	Your message for Dhoni?         
	That he should enjoy his innings... There will be times, like in this World T20, when things wont go well.         
	Do captains have a shelf life?         
	Depends on individuals.         
	South Africas Graeme Smith has been around for over six years...         
	Yes and it took them six years (under Smith) to beat Australia in Australia... There will always be things to aim for, newer challenges... South Africa havent won the (50-over) World Cup and, so, Smith would be looking to do that in 2011.         
	The final one: Where do you intend focusing your wildlife protection and conservation drive back in India?         
	(Laughs) Ill be starting from home, Karnataka!

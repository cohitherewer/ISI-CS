The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 2011 Cup meeting today
                                                   2011 Cup meeting today
                      
	New Delhi: Top cricket officials of the Asian nations will attend an emergency meeting of the 2011 World Cup Central Organising Committee here Tuesday to discuss some crucial issues related to the ICC events.         
	ICC vice-president Sharad Pawar, who heads the World Cup Organising Committee, will chair the meeting to be attended by representatives of Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.         
	A three-member delegation from Pakistan led by chairman Ejaz Butt will also be there.         
	BCCI sources said matters related to the World Cup and preparation of the venues would be discussed at the conclave.         
	It is a routine meeting of the organising committee. It is to take stock of the arrangements made so far and draw up plans for the future, the source said.         
	The tense relations between India and Pakistan in the aftermath of the Mumbai terror attacks is another issue that might come up for discussion.         
	The worry is that if preparations are not held on schedule the ICC and other countries might be forced to consider moving the tournament out of Asia, the source said.         
	The ICC has already warned the four boards that they are one year behind preparations and need to speed up things.         
	The shifting of the ICC Champions Trophy out of Pakistan is also expected to come up for discussion. The ICC is due to decide on a new venue for the tournament in April. (PTI)

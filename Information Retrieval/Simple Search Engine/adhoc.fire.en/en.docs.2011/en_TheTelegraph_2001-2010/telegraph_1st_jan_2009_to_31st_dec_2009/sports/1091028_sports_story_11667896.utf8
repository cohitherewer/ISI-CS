	Lyon: Third-seeded Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia beat Martin Vassallo Arguello of Argentina 6-3, 6-4 Tuesday in the first round of the Lyon Grand Prix.         
	Ljubicic, looking for his first title this season, won 29 of 33 points on first serve including seven aces. The defeat would have been heavier for Vassallo Arguello if he hadnt saved 10 of 12 break points.         
	The eighth-seeded Albert Montanes of Spain beat Fabrice Santoro 6-4, 6-4. The 36-year-old Frenchman is playing his final season on the ATP circuit.         
	Also, David Guez of France beat Rajeev Ram of the US 6-2, 6-4, and Marc Gicquel downed Jerome Haehnel 6-1, 6-4 earlier in an all-French match.         
	Gicquel, runner-up in 2006 and 2007 at the indoor hard-court tournament, served eight aces and saved the only break point he faced. He next plays either sixth-seeded Paul-Henri Mathieu of France or Leonardo Mayer of Argentina.

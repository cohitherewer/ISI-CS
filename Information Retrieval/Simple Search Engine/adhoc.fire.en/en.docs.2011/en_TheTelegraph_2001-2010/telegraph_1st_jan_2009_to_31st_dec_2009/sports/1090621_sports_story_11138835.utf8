The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AIFF fears govt bite 
                                                   AIFF fears govt bite 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: A day after Bob Houghton lashed out at the sports minister for poor football infrastructure, the ministry of sports, it seems, was rethinking its decision to sanction funds for the national teams tour of Dubai and Spain.         
	Although a senior ministry official maintained that the proposal tabled by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) was still being processed, sources said the ministry may now only clear the tour on a no cost to the government basis. The twin tour, which starts next Thursday, is going to cost the AIFF a whopping Rs 1.50 crore.         
	The government first agreed to bear the airfare to Dubai and Spain, which comes to around Rs 80 lakh, sources said. The attitude of the ministry seems to have undergone a dramatic change after Bobs outburst against the sports minister on Thursday.         
	When the AIFF approached the ministry on Friday, they were told the file was still with the joint secretary. There were clear indications that the money might not be sanctioned in the end, sources said.         
	A senior sports ministry official, when contacted by The Telegraph on Saturday, said: There is no reason to believe that we have rejected the proposal. Generally, we dont sanction funds for such tours. Its a very expensive tour. But since the football team is preparing for the Asia Cup, we decided to give it a thought.         
	A clear picture will only emerge next week, added the official.

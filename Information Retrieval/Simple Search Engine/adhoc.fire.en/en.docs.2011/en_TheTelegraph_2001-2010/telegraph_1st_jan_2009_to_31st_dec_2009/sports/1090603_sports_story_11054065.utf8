The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | NZ loss doesnt worry Dhoni 
                                                   NZ loss doesnt worry Dhoni 
                      
	London: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni refused to read too much into the teams nine-run defeat in Mondays World Twenty20 warm-up match against New Zealand and said the side had adequate back-up plans.         
	Chasing 171, Dhonis team seemed cruising to victory before New Zealands disciplined bowling at the death put paid to the defending champions hopes.         
	Dhoni, however, preferred to look at the positives and said he was not unduly worried about the loss.         
	Obviously we had some targets. A couple of batsmen got really good starts. Of course during the game we lost wickets at crucial times but we wanted to try a few things, specially in bowling and all of that worked for us, Dhoni said.         
	Quite disappointed with the defeat but we have back-up plans and so Im not really worried, he said. Besides, we missed quite a few key players, Dhoni added.         
	Dhoni was particularly happy about Ishant Sharma who returned to form with a four-wicket haul. I think it would give him great deal of confidence. He is a bowler who should be bowling at the start and also in the end. In between he came and got us those crucial wickets, Dhoni said.         
	Laid low by food poisoning, Yuvraj Singh didnt play Monday, while Virender Sehwag also skipped the match due to fitness problems.         
	Dhoni assured they would all be fit before Indias next warm-up match against Pakistan on Wednesday.         
	A couple of guys had food poisoning but Im sure everyone will be fine before our next warm-up game, he added.         
	Dhoni, who carried out a few different experiments at Lords, said he kept Ishant for the middle overs, a move which paid dividends, but the idea of the pacer bowling a new length at the death did not really click.         
	Instead of yorkers, we wanted him to bowl differently in the final three overs. Unfortunately it didnt work, Dhoni said.         
	We have seen other teams do it regularly so we wanted to use this opportunity to try it out. Unfortunately, it didnt work. If we have to go to the basics of bowling yorkers, we would do so, he said.         
	India conceded nearly 40 runs in the final three overs and compounded the problem by scoring just 24 runs off the final four over of their chase.         
	Its just not about doing well in the first few overs or in the end. Its critical that teams dont lose too many wickets between 6 and 10 overs. Thats why somebody like Ishant can be crucial in the middle overs. He could dry up the runs and batsmen could lose wickets in trying to go after him, Dhoni said.         
	However, Dhonis idea of promoting Rohit Sharma as an opener in place of Virender Sehwag, who is carrying a shoulder injury, was very successful.         
	Indians suffered their fourth successive defeat at the hands of New Zealand and their skipper Daniel Vettori, with figures of three for 23, once again played a critical hand.         
	Four defeats in four matches is a bit of concern, conceded the Indian captain, adding that however, in one of the overs he was also hit for 20 runs by Suresh Raina. So its not as if he cant be attacked or 40-50 runs cant be taken off his bowling.         
	The 28-year-old captain felt spinners would call the shots in the meet.         
	Most of the sides have quality spinners in their ranks as they understand slow bowlers have a huge role to play. Spinners, I am sure, will have a bigger impact in this tournament, he said. Both Harbhajan Singh and Pragyan Ojha were allowed to bowl their full quota on Monday.

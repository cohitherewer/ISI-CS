                                                   Shukla not living in the past
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Agartala: Last years runners-up Bengal will not be dwelling in the past when they take the field against Tamil Nadu in the Vijay Hazare Trophy final here on Monday, captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla said. Bengal lost the final last year against Saurashtra.         
	According to Shukla the team have moved on from that defeat and would look at Mondays final as just another match.         
	Its just another match and Tamil Nadu is just another opponent. When you want to achieve something, you need to play well, Shukla said after the teams three-hour practice session at the Maharaja Bir Bikram Stadium on Sunday.         
	Past is past What has happened has happened. What we want to achieve tomorrow is what matters. We have to play sensible cricket, the Bengal captain said.         
	The batsmen need to spend some time at the wicket. On this wicket you cant just play aggressively.         
	Shuklas jaws tightened when a journalist asked him to react on Tamil Nadu captain R Ashwins remark that Bengal lack depth in batting.         
	I would not really like to react to that. Well see that tomorrow, he said after a pause.         
	Tamil Nadu coach W.V. Raman said the team were not worried about the fact that they havent played on the ground in their last two matches.         
	It doesnt seem to be too different. As long as we play well, it shouldnt be a problem, the former India cricketer said.         
	He did not agree that all Tamil Nadu need to do is to dismiss Manoj Tiwary cheaply.         
	Cricket is a game of 11 players. Were not thinking about any individual player. We have prepared for the Bengal team, which is made up of 11 players, he quipped.

	Men to watch out for          Manoj Tiwary  The stylish right-hander is the batting mainstay of Bengal and would need to put up a stellar show if Bengal are to harbour any hopes of putting up a good total on the board. Tiwary bats at No. 4, the most important position in any team rsquo;s batting order, and bowls his own brand of medium-pace. He is also a brilliant fielder and saves quite a few runs for the side. Tiwary has donned the India colours in an one-day International against Australia.            Laxmi Ratan Shukla  The Bengal captain has regularly performed for the side with his all-round show. He bats right-handed, at No. 5, and has the capability of scoring quick runs towards the end. He has been a revelation with the ball and can be quite a tricky customer on low and slow wickets. Shukla has played in three ODIs for India and was rated as a very promising youngster in the early years of his career.            Ranadeb Bose  The tall right-arm medium pacer has been a key performer for Bengal over the years and leads the fast-bowling department of the team. He has cut down on pace over the years and focuses mainly on line and length. The miserly Bose regularly provides early breakthroughs for Bengal, and picked up the highest number of wickets for the state in the 2008-09 Ranji Trophy season. With age not on his side, he, though, has failed to impress the national selectors.  
	---------            Subramaniam   Badrinath  Tamil Nadu rsquo;s batting revolves around this technically sound right-hand batsman. Badrinath, who bats at No. 4, has been the batting mainstay of the state for a long time now. His thirst for runs seems to be insatiable. He is also a brilliant fielder and has played for India in three ODIs.            R. Ashwin  The tall right-arm offspinner is the Tamil Nadu captain. He made his first-class debut in the 2006-07 season and has improved in leaps and bounds. Ashwin is also a very handy late-order batsman and has time and often made useful contributions down the order.            Arun Karthik  The right-hander bats at No. 3 for the Tamil Nadu team and also bowls leg spin. The exciting youngster made his first-class debut for Tamil Nadu this season and is known to be electric on the field.

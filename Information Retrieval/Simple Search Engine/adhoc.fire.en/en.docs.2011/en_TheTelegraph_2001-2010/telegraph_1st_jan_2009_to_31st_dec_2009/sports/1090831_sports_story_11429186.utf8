                                                   Only one left to win: Rafa
            LIZ CLARKE                      
	Mason: Among the countless boys who dreamed of becoming Spains next tennis champion, a preternatural ferocity set Rafael Nadal apart. The way he attacked every ball and played each point as if it were his last  even at age 14, whether in practice or competition  was so striking that it worried Jose Higueras.         
	Sooner or later, the former Spanish great remembers thinking, this promising youngsters passion for tennis would take a toll on his body. And it was simply a matter of time, he feared, before the boy would be forced to take a long break.         
	Everybody told (me) this in the past: This guy only can play two years like this, Nadal said this month, during a break in preparations for his second tournament after the recent injury-induced hiatus that had been predicted. And then, its five now. Five years I am there (in the top ranks). I am there. Still there, no? You never know when you finish your career. But I hope to be here a few more years.         
	Forced to the sidelines by tendinitis in both knees, Nadal disappeared from the tennis landscape for two months this summer. The layoff, which came on the heels of his stunning fourth-round loss at the French Open on May 31 and lasted until early August, robbed mens tennis of its most charismatic figure, stalled its most compelling rivalry and cost Nadal dearly.         
	He was unable to defend the Wimbledon crown that he wrested from Roger Federer in a 2008 final that was considered the greatest ever played. So he watched from his home on the island of Majorca as the peerless Swiss reclaimed the title and, with it, the No. 1 world ranking. In the weeks that followed, Nadal slipped to No. 3, his lowest rank since 2005.         
	So in the Cincinnati Masters, Nadal took measured steps back to form in hopes of being as fit as possible for his seventh assault on the US Open, the one major title to elude him.         
	But the challenge that confronts Nadal on the eve of this years tournament is more deep-seated than the tricky first-round opponent he has drawn or even the lingering questions about his knees.         
	It goes to the essence of his game  and how many more years he can mount a credible challenge given the painful ailment hes grappling with at a relatively tender age. Nadals relentless, physical style of play is what has made him exceptional. Yet it has also exacted a price, with different forms of tendinitis forcing him to cut short his 2008 season and halt his 2009 campaign at its most critical juncture.         
	As Nadal looks to the future, the fundamental question is twofold: Can he retool his game so he runs less and finishes matches more quickly, and still achieve world-class results? Or is Nadals punishing approach to tennis  more defensive than offensive, so encoded in his competitive DNA that such an overhaul is unthinkable?         
	The US Open has long represented Nadals greatest challenge. Although he won four French Opens, Wimbledon and the Australian Open by age 22, Nadal has never gotten past the semi-finals of the US Open.         
	Hard courts arent his best surface. And Nadal doesnt feel entirely at home in the cavernous, 23,000-seat Arthur Ashe Stadium, the worlds largest tennis venue.         
	Theres also the matter of its place on the calendar, coming eight months into the season. Given Nadals penchant for playing more matches than his peers, he has rarely arrived fresh. This year, he may be arriving too fresh. Its not the best preparation  an injury of two months, he said, asked about his expectations. But Im going to try my best. Im going to push hard every year to try to win it.         
	The US , he noted after a long pause, is the only one who remains.

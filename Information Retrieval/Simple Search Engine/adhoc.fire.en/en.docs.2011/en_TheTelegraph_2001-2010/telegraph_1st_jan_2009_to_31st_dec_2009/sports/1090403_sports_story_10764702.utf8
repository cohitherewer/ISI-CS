The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania, Chuang reach semis
                                                     Sania, Chuang reach semis
                  Roger Federer in Miami on Wednesday                     
	Miami: Indian tennis ace Sania Mirza and her Taiwanese partner Chuang Chia-Jung continuing their good run and humbled second-seeded Anabel Medina Garrigues and Virginia Ruano Pascual 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) to sail into the womens doubles semi-final of the $4.5 million Sony Ericsson Open here.         
	On a day of upsets, Sania and Chuang made their presence felt by pulling the rug from under the feet of their seeded opponents, whose last ditch effort for a fight-back wilted in the second set tie-breaks.         
	Sania and Chuang will meet the winner of the remaining quarter final match, to be played between third-seeded Kveta Peschke and Lisa Raymond and Raquel Kops-Jones and Abigail Spears in the semi-finals.         
	Sania and Chuang seemed to have struck the perfect chord and they had earlier stunned eighth seeds Maria Kirilenko and Flavia Pennetta in a gruelling three-setter in their previous encounter.         
	Venus and Serena Williams say theyve seen little of each other for the past week because of their busy schedules. That will change on Thursday, when they meet in the singles semi-finals.         
	The 20th showdown between the sisters ensures a finalist from the family on Saturday. The Williamses have won eight of the past 11 Key Biscayne titles. Serena advanced first on Wednesday, overcoming a dismal start to beat unseeded Li Na of China 4-6, 7-6 (7-1), 6-2. Five hours later she was joined by No. 5-seeded Venus, who beat No. 26 Iveta Benesova of the Czech Republic 6-1, 6-4. The other womens semi-final on Thursday will be between No. 8 Svetlana Kuznetsova and No. 11 Victoria Azarenka.         
	In the showcase night match, No. 2 Roger Federer needed dominant serving and one lucky bounce to beat Andy Roddick 6-3, 4-6, 6-4. Federer lost serve only once and broke after hitting a passing shot on the next- to-last point that clipped the net cord and hopped over Roddicks racket for a winner.         
	Federer improved to 17-2 against Roddick and avenged a defeat when they met in the Key Biscayne quarter finals last year.         
	Federers opponent on Friday will be No. 3 Novak Djokovic, who beat No. 10 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-3, 6-4, ending a four-match losing streak to the Frenchman.           (AP)

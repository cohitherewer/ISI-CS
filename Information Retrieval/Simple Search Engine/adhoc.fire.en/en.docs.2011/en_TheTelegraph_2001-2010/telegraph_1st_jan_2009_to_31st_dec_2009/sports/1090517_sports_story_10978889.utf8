	Port Elizabeth: J.P. Duminy hit 62 and Abhishek Nayar added an unbeaten 33 to guide the Mumbai Indians to 147 for five against the Chennai Super Kings in their Indian Premier League match on Saturday.               
	Matthew Haydens unbeaten 60 off 57 balls helped the Chennai Super Kings overcome the 148-run target in 19.1 overs, beating the Mumbai Indians by seven wickets               
	Duminy held the Mumbai Indians innings together until the final over, hitting four boundaries and two sixes in 54 balls at the St. Georges Park. His 65-run stand for the third wicket with Nayar (33 from 27 balls) assured the Mumbai side of a competitive total after losing three top-order wickets.         
	Duminy capitalised on a quickfire start provided by opener Sanath Jayasuriya (30), anchoring the innings and reaching his fifth half-century of the tournament.         
	Promoting Jayasuriya up the order was clearly a good move. He didnt get much strike in the first four overs and struggled a bit with timing in scoring two off seven balls. But in the fifth he unleashed.         
	The Sri Lankan smashed three boundaries and two sixes in his 17-ball innings before he miscued a Sudeep Tyagi ball for Suresh Raina to take a high catch.         
	The Super Kings attack was led by Albie Morkel who maintained a good length throughout, returning figures of one for 31 in four overs.         
	Morkel took the first wicket in the third over when Dwayne Bravo played on the backfoot to be bowled by a yorker for 5.         
	Captain Sachin Tendulkar added 11 runs before hitting straight to Lakshmipathy Balaji at deep mid-wicket off a slower ball from off-spinner Raina. Duminy was run out by Morkel off his own bowling after Nayar called for a single.

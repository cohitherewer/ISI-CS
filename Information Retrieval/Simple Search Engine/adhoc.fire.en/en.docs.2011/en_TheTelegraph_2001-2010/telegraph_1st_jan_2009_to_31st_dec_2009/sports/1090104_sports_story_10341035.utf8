            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Rohan Bopanna received a shot in the arm after managing a tie-up with top-ranked Finnish player Jarkko Nieminen as his doubles partner for the 2009 season.         
	Nieminen, 27, is a strong player both in singles and doubles, with a current ranking of 37 and 80 in singles and doubles respectively.         
	Bopanna, who paired up with former world No.1 and multiple Grand Slam champion Max Mirnyi in Moscow last year, said he still had not given up on singles.

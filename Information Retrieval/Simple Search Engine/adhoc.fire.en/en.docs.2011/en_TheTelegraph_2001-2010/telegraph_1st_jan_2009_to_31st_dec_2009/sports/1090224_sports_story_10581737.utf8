The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL is perfect for Flintoff
                                                   IPL is perfect for Flintoff
                              Guest Column        Geoffrey Boycott      
	While losing Andrew Flintoff for the fourth Test match, starting on Thursday, is clearly a major setback, it is time that the other England players got used to doing without him.         
	My hunch is that he wont be playing much five-day cricket once this summers Ashes are finished. He might even retire from Tests altogether.         
	Flintoff has been the iconic figure of the team for several years now, and it is easy to see why. When fit, he has been Englands best bowler by far. He never, ever, bowls badly  even if his instinctive desire to keep things tight means that he doesnt perhaps attack, and take wickets, as often as he might.         
	There have been plenty of times when England would have liked Flintoff to bowl at both ends. As a result, he has got through a hell of a lot of overs. He is mentally strong, and has a big heart, as he showed in Antigua last week by running in hard despite the pain of his hip injury.         
	But fast bowling is a young mans game, and Flintoff will be 32 this coming winter. He is no twinkle toes  not somebody like Malcolm Marshall or Michael Holding, who would glide over the turf. He is a big heavy man who crunches all his weight down on to the bowling crease. His spirit may be willing but his body isnt, and the injuries are starting to come with alarming regularity.         
	After the 2009 Ashes are over, I expect Flintoff to start concentrating on the 50-over and 20-over forms of the game. There is so much one-day cricket around these days that he should be able to extend his career by several years. Of course, the Indian Premier League (IPL) will give him a nice living on its own. But there are also all the international one-day events  the World Cup, the World Twenty20 and the Champions Trophy  for him to focus his attention on.         
	People are already questioning whether Flintoff should be pulling out of the IPL this coming spring to save all his energies for the Ashes. Im not sure that is a realistic suggestion, unless the hip injury hangs around for a couple of months and completely incapacitates him. In fact, I would argue that the IPL could be exactly what he needs.         
	Flintoffs ideal preparation for the summer is regular bowling, but with a controlled workload. He generally gets through 30 or 40 overs in a Test  and that is too many for a man of his age and build. In the IPL, he only has to send down four. Its the sort of short, sharp run-out that will keep his muscles and sinews all toned up for competitive action without putting too much strain on them.         
	You also have to consider where Flintoffs future lies. If his body will not cope with being dragged around the international schedule all year long, the IPL is the perfect competition for him. A salary packet of 1 million for six weeks of slogging and short bowling spells  its almost like stealing money. He will be understandably reluctant to stand his new employers up when he could be building a long-term relationship with them.         
	Flintoffs absences are familiar enough. We were lucky enough to see him at his peak in the 2005 Ashes, when he was 27 years old, but he has appeared in just 23 of 46 Tests since then. The challenge now is for Stuart Broad to make the step up from promising young player to pukka Test all-rounder at No. 7.         
	Meanwhile the wicketkeeper, Matt Prior, has to move up to No. 6. Prior made a century on his Test debut, and averages just over 40, so he clearly has quality.         
	Andrew Strauss must give him more responsibility and tell him he can produce even better figures now he has settled down as an England player.         
	I thought the team put up an excellent showing in Antigua. No one ever gets a result on that pitch: you could let a stick of dynamite off on it and it would hardly show a scratch. But they need to take 20 wickets in Barbados, which means a five-man attack, including two spinners, is a necessity.

            A CORRESPONDENT            Chris Martin celebrates one of his wickets in Napier on Saturday. (AP)                           
	Napier: Chris Martin, the most successful bowler for New Zealand in Indias first innings, said they were not expecting to make India follow on on Saturday itself.                 
	The following are excerpts         
	On the days play         
	Just a tough grind, really. I think the results showed the discipline we bowled with today (Saturday). Definitely, there were phases where we thought we could be in trouble. Like when Sachin (Tendulkar) and (Rahul) Dravid were batting really well at the start of the day. We had to keep plugging away at phases of the game, and making sure we came out on top at the end of the day.         
	If New Zealand expected to make India follow on on Saturday itself         
	Realistically, you dont look that far ahead. Its quite difficult to picture getting nine wickets on that pitch in a day. For us to actually end up with that result is something we werent expecting at the start of the day. Its a big thing, but it was definitely a tough day.         
	On getting his 150th Test wicket         
	Around December, I wasnt thinking that I would be able to get back to the team and get another crack at it. My aim this summer has been to get on the park against India and do well.         
	If he is satisfied with his performance         
	I think havent had that for a while. Last time I had a day like that in the sun was against SA (South Africa) at Eden Park. So to have that adrenaline and that enjoyment from doing well and having the crowd behind you is something that is pretty cool.

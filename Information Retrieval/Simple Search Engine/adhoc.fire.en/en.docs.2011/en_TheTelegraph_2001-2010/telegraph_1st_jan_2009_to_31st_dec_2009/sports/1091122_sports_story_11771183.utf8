	Lucknow: Curtains were drawn on Indian challenge after all three doubles pairs lost their respective matches to crash out of the 19th Asian Table Tennis Championships here on Saturday.         
	The Indian duo of Achanta Sharath Kamal and Sourav Chakraborty squandered an early 1-0 lead before going down to Jiang Tianyi and Tang Peng of Hong Kong 3-1 in mens doubles pre-quarters.         
	Despite a spirited start with 11-7 win in the first game, the Indian pair couldnt stop the Hong Kong duo from coming back into the match as they bagged three consecutive games (11-5, 11-6, 11-6) to wrap up the issue.         
	Soumyadeep Roy and Jubin Kumar fell to Chinese duo of Wang Liqin and Zhang Jike 0-3 after losing the encounter 6-11, 3-11, 6-11.         
	In womens doubles, Poulomi Ghatak and Mouma Das also lost 1-3 to Jiang Huajun and T Ya Na of Hong Kong.         
	After losing the first two games (7-11, 9-11), the Indian pair tried to claw their way back into the match and bagged the third one 11-7. But their comeback bid was foiled as they lost the next game 3-11.         
	Meanwhile, Ma Long and Li Xiaoxia defeated Zhang Jike and Ding Ning 4-2 in an all-Chinese affair to bag the mixed doubles title. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhawan hits 100 but Delhi on the ropes
                                                                                                                                   Dhawan hits 100 but Delhi on the ropes
                      
	New Delhi: Shikhar Dhawans painstaking century may not be enough to avert a defeat as a depleted Delhi crawled to 255 for nine in their second innings against Karnataka on day three of the Ranji Trophy Super League Group B match against Karnataka here Friday.         
	Having already conceded 106-run first innings lead, Delhis only objective now would be to deny the visitors an outright win, and, at stumps on day three, they have managed to take a 149-run overall lead with just one wicket and a full day remaining.         
	Dhawans more than five-hour vigil, facing 180 balls and hitting 13 boundaries for his 100, came to a sad end when he ran himself out in the 69th over.         
	Apart from the left-hander, the other overnight batsman, Rajat Bhatia, hit a gritty 64, while Abhishek Sharma contributed 34 runs down the order.         
	For Karnataka, Sreenath Aravind (4/39) and R Vinay Kumar (3/58) shared seven wickets between them.         
	In Rajkot, disciplined bowling performances by RP Singh and Salabh Srivastav helped Uttar Pradesh take an all important 128-run first inning lead over Saurashtra. The hosts were bundled out for 267. Uttar Pradesh, in their second essay, lost three wickets at 72 runs at the end of third days play and stretched their overall lead to 200 runs.

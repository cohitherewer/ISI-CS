	 ICC talks tough to Pakistan
    Islamabad: The International Cricket Council (ICC) says Pakistan will not be paid around $10 million of hosting fees if the country does not provide alternative venues for the 2011 World Cup.         
	The ICC in April ruled out Pakistan as a location on security grounds, but kept the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) as joint host for the event with India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.         
	That meant the PCB could receive the hosting fees if it holds its scheduled 14 World Cup matches in another location  most likely the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Pakistan will receive hosting fees for the 2009 Champions Trophy even though that tournament had been moved to South Africa on security grounds, but the ICC said Friday there would be no such arrangement with the World Cup if the PCB is not involved in the event.         
	Abbas view         
	 Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Zaheer Abbas has opposed the PCB (PCBs) idea of hiring a sports psychologist to help cricketers cope up with the pressure and perform well in the Twenty20 World Cup starting on June 5 in England. I dont understand what purpose will it serve to have a sports psychologist give lectures to the players. Because it is obvious that the teams main problem is the batting not clicking consistently as it should, Abbas said.         
	Deep decision         
	 Calcutta: Deep Dasgupta on Friday decided to snap ties with the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL) and sought a release to take up the BCCIs amnesty offer. The former Bengal captain joined five other statemates - batsmen Rohan Gavaskar, Abhishek Jhunjhunwala and Subhomoy Das, left-arm spinner Shiv Sagar Singh and medium-pacer Eklak Ahmed  in seeking a release from the ICL.         
	Barry loses son         
	 Johannesburg: Barry Richards eldest son  Mark  has committed suicide, according to media reports here. Barry confirmed that the tragedy happened this week. Its a difficult time to talk about it now. We are shattered. Id rather not talk about it now but will eventually do so later on, Richards was quoted as saying by local media here.

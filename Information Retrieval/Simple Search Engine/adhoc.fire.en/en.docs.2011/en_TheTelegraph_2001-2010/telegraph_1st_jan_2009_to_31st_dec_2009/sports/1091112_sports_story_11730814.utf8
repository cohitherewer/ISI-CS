The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods faces uphill task
                                                                                                                                     Woods faces uphill task

	Melbourne: Tiger Woods must overcome packed crowds, scorching heat and a strong local contingent bent on humbling the world No.1 on home soil to win his first title Down Under at this weeks Australian Masters.         
	Woods, who was flustered by camera-happy fans at the HSBC Champions in Shanghai last week, will not be short of company at Melbournes Kingston Heath course, where a crowd of 100,000 will witness his first appearance in Australia for 11 years.         
	While the American laughed off the 7,000 fans and low-hovering helicopters watching his practice round on Tuesday, organisers have vowed to swoop on errant mobile phone and camera-users among the first-time golf-watchers in the crowd.         
	Little can be done about the weather, however, which has Melbourne in the grip of a record-breaking late spring heatwave that is forecast to bake Kingston Heaths already tricky greens into flint-hard frying pans over the weekend.         
	Players who battle through the heat to make the cut at the $1.4 million event will be rewarded with temperatures expected to reach 35 degree celsius day on Saturday, while Sunday is forecast to cool to a slightly more bearable 30.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | US teen Oudin fells Jankovic 
                                                   US teen Oudin fells Jankovic 
    - Kuznetsova, Davydenko ousted; Hewitt through to fourth round                           
	Wimbledon: American teenager Melanie Oudin pulled off the biggest upset of the first week at Wimbledon on Saturday, beating former No. 1 Jelena Jankovic, 6-7 (8-10), 7-5, 6-2.         
	The No. 6-seeded Jankovic struggled with the heat on a sunny, 82-degree afternoon, and took a 12-minute break after the first set. The 2008 US Open runner-up also needed treatment of her left foot later, and she was plagued by erratic groundstrokes, while the 17-year-old Oudin played with poise down the stretch and swept the final three games.         
	I was just thinking that she was any other player, Oudin said, and this was any other match, and I was at any other tournament  not like on the biggest stage at Wimbledon. I think I handled it really well.         
	Five-time champion Venus Williams joined Oudin in the round of 16 by beating Carla Suarez Navarro 6-0, 6-4. Watching the Williams sisters at Wimbledon inspired Oudin as a child.         
	When I was like 7, when I started playing tennis, I saw Venus and Serena Williams playing here and I was like, Mom, I really, really want to play there one day, Oudin said.         
	She said, Go for it. My parents have always been very supportive.         
	In mens play, 2002 champion Lleyton Hewitt reached the fourth round for the sixth year in a row by beating Philipp Petzschner 7-5, 7-6 (7-3), 6-3.         
	Andy Roddick used his big serve to overcome Austrian Juergen Melzer 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-2), 4-6, 6-3 to reach the fourth round.         
	 The first two sets went with serve but each time the American sixth seed kept his cool in the tiebreak.         
	Melzer, the 26th seed, broke for 3-2 in the third and gave himself three set points with a beautiful lob, sealing the set with a crosscourt forehand that Roddick did not even move for.         
	With rain clouds gathering above Centre Court, Roddick made sure the match did not go into a decider and secured victory with his 33rd ace of the match.         
	The American, runner-up in 2004 and 2005, will face Czech 20th seed Tomas Berdych for a place in the quarter finals         
	Oudin wasnt the only teen to make a splash on the final day of the first week. Unseeded 19-year-old Sabine Lisicki of Germany upset No. 5 Svetlana Kuznetsova, the French Open champion, 6-2, 7-5.         
	Before I came into this Wimbledon championships, I hadnt won, actually, a match on grass, Lisicki said. I just cant believe Im in the fourth round.         
	No. 9-seeded Caroline Wozniacki, 18, reached the fourth round for the first time by beating No. 20 Anabel Medina Garrigues 6-2, 6-2. No. 11 Agnieszka Radwanska earned a chance to play Oudin on Monday by beating No. 19 Li Na 6-4, 7-5.         
	No. 17 Amelie Mauresmo, the 2006 Wimbledon champion, defeated No.15 Flavia Pennetta 7-5, 6-3.         
	Oudin arrived in London with a 0-2 record in Grand Slam matches, and she had to win three qualifying matches to make Wimbledons main draw for the first time. Shes ranked 124th and will crack the top 100 for the first time after the tournament.         
	Facing a top-10 opponent for the first time, Oudin wore down Jankovic in an arduous first set. Oudin failed to convert four set points, committing an unforced error each time, but when the 66-minute set ended, it was Jankovic who appeared on the ropes.         
	A trainer and doctor came on court to check Jankovics pulse and blood pressure. She rested on a towel while being treated, and after several minutes sat up while ice was applied to her neck and midsection.         
	Jankovic later said she was ailing in part because of woman problems.         
	Its not easy being a woman, you know, sometimes, Jankovic said. After the first set, I felt really dizzy, and I thought that I was just going to end up in the hospital. I started to shake. I was losing my, how you say, consciousness. ... I came back, like I started to feel a little bit better. But I was feeling quite weak. No power. I wasnt the same player.         
	Jankovic played on, but the Serb has struggled all year to regain the form that made her the US Open runner-up in 2008.         
	The match turned when Oudin overcame a 5-4 deficit in the second set. She repeatedly won points with drop shots, punctuating winners with shouts of Come on! The teenager smacked a forehand winner on the final point, then raised her arms in celebration.         
	I go into every match the exact same, you know, like no matter who I play, Oudin said.         
	Its not like, Oh my gosh, Im playing the No. 1 player in the world. Every match is the same for me, because it all depends on what game I play and what shots I hit and all that stuff.         
	Williams took charge early against the 34th-ranked Suarez Navarro, winning the first eight games.         
	The two played only once before, when Suarez Navarro upset Williams in the second round at the Australian Open in January.         
	Completely different circumstances, Williams said. In Australia I had a lot of opportunities but didnt take advantage of them. Today I realised that it wasnt the same match, and I was determined to really run away with it.         
	In mens play, No. 29 Igor Andreev and Tommy Haas won matches suspended overnight because of darkness. Andreev beat Andreas Seppi 6-1, 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 7-6 (7-5). Haas defeated Marin Cilic 7-5, 7-5, 1-6, 6-7 (3-7), 10-8.         
	No. 20 Tomas Berdych eliminated No. 12 Nikolay Davydenko 6-2, 6-3, 6-2.         
	The No. 3-seeded Williams will next play 2008 French Open champion Ana Ivanovic, who beat 2009 Roland Garros semi-finalist Samantha Stosur 7-5, 6-2. Williams, whose younger sister Serena reached the round of 16 by winning Friday, is 5-1 against Ivanovic.         
	Shes a very dangerous opponent, Ivanovic said, but I think I have a great chance, and I feel very comfortable going into that match. Im so excited to have the opportunity for that challenge.         
	Williams is trying to become the first woman since Steffi Graf in 1991-93 to win three consecutive titles at the All England Club. (AP)

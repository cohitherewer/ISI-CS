                                                     AFC respite for city coaches
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Subhas Bhowmick                           
	New Delhi: The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) may allow top Calcutta coaches like Subhas Bhowmick and Subroto Bhattacharya to continue playing their trade for some more time.         
	The All India Football Federation (AIFF) general secretary, Alberto Colaco, who returned on Tuesday after attending a series of meetings in the AFC headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, said the Asian body has accepted his suggestion to review the situation.         
	Earlier, the AFC made it mandatory for all I-League teams to employ coaches with AFC A License, a decision that threatened to make some of the top names among Indian coaches jobless.         
	The AFC is likely to review the decision, Colaco said. I could explain them the situation back in our country.         
	Colaco said he also told the parent body to review their decision on Indian coaches having coaching diplomas from the National Institute of Sports (NIS). I asked them to consider it as per with Leipzig University coaching degree. AFC treats the Leipzig University pass outs as AFC B License holders. I told them that similar treatment should be given to our NIS diploma holders. They have asked me provide them with the NIS syllabus. he said.         
	The AFC executive committee has also included India in the AFC Aid 27 programme. Under this scheme, India will receive an annual grant of $120,000 for grassroot development and appointment of youth level coaches and director of coaching in all five zones of the country.         
	Meanwhile, the AIFF has received more than 50 applications till date for the posts of general secretary and chief executive officer.

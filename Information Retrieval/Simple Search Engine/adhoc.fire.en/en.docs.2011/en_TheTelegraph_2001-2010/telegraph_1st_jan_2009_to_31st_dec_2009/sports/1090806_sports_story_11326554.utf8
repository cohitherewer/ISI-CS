                                                     Saha: Have to grab chances
            A STAFF REPORTER            Wriddhiman Saha at his residence on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Wriddhiman Saha does not want to rest on laurels and wants to keep the good work going to remain in the national selectors scheme of things.         
	Already in Indias Champions Trophy probables list  he is the lone face from Bengal  Saha says he still has miles to go.         
	To break into the national team you have to very good. Right now I am just good. So I have to grab whatever chance I get and perform. Thats the only way you can get a national shirt, Saha said at his residence on Wednesday.         
	The CAB cricketer of the year award-winner said it would be too early to brand him as an Indian prospect. Please dont. Its early days in my career. First let me prove myself consistently in the domestic circuit, he said.         
	Back in the city after a successful Emerging Players Tournament Down Under  the Indian fringe players won the trophy defeating South Africa in the final and Saha was in the thick of actions scoring 74  the wicketkeeper-batsman is yearning for more action.         
	I need to play more matches and I need to score tons of runs and need to take lot of catches. There is so much competition for the wicketkeeper-batsmans slot, he retorted.         
	By his own admission, the 74 in the final was not the best in his career. Frankly speaking, it was not my best. Yeah it helped my team to win the trophy but thats all, Saha said.         
	My best was in a 2004 Buchi Babu Trophy match in Chennai against Uttar Pradesh. CAB XI was struggling at 35 for six, and I scored an unbeaten 88. We won the match by one wicket. That was one innings I will cherish even after 50 years, he said.         
	So how was the experience Down Under.         
	Its winter time there. So along with the bounce, the ball was also moving. The general perception is that Indian players dont prefer the moving ball. But in Brisbane I adapted myself to the conditions well and the result was there for all to see, he said.         
	Saha came into prominence while playing for the Kolkata Knight Riders during the first edition of IPL. And since then he hasnt looked back.         
	The IPL has made me what I am today. It has changed my lifestyle, it has given me the confidence to face the world.

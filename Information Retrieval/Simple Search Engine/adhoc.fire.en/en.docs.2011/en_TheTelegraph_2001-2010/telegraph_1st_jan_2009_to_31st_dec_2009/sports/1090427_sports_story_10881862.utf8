	Manama: Britains Jenson Button won the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday for the Formula One championship leaders third victory in four races with newcomers Brawn GP this season.         
	The 29-year-olds success at Sakhir dashed Toyotas hopes of a breakthrough first win after the Japanese manufacturer had started with both their cars on the front row for the first time.         
	Germanys Sebastian Vettel was second for Red Bull with Toyotas Italian Jarno Trulli finishing third from pole position.         
	Button, with four career wins, now has 31 points to Brazilian teammate Rubens Barrichellos 19 and Vettels 18. To come away with the win, at this point in the season, I am chuffed to bits, said the Briton, who overtook McLarens world champion Lewis Hamilton on the second lap after his compatriot had powered past at the start.         
	That move really made the race for us, he said. I had to make it stick and I did. This win for us is probably the best of the lot.         
	Trulli sounded deflated: Im a little bit disappointed because I was waiting for the first win for Toyota, said the Italian. Lets wait to fight again for the next race.         
	Force India achieved its modest target of a double finish with Giancarlo Fisichella bringing home his car in 15th position, followed by teammate Adrian Sutil.         
	Starting 17th on the grid, Fisichella gained four places from his starting position on the first lap and had graduated to 12th by his first pit stop on lap 15. The Italian then moved up to 10th and by the midpoint of the race was racing with Renault and McLaren cars.         
	The Italian, however, had increasing discomfort in the closing stages of the race with his seat and he finished the race 15th. Sutil had a strong race from 19th on the grid and the German was 11th by his late first stop, thanks to an aggressive strategy.         
	Champions Ferrari finally opened their account with 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen finishing sixth for the Italian teams first points of the year. Hamilton, whose team could receive a heavy punishment at a hearing in Paris on Wednesday for lying to stewards at the Australian season-opener, took fourth place after crucially keeping Vettel behind him while Button was pulling away.         
	Barrichello was fifth, ahead of Raikkonen, with Toyotas Timo Glock seventh and Renaults double world champion Fernando Alonso taking the final point on a hot afternoon with air temperatures around 35 degrees Celsius. Glock, lighter on fuel than his teammate, made the quicker start and led for the first 10 laps before pitting and handing over to Trulli.

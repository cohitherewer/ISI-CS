The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhupathi eyeing career Slam
                                                   Bhupathi eyeing career Slam
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mahesh Bhupathi on Thursday sought to downplay his being on the verge of a career Grand Slam and what could have been a scintillating summit clash against Leander Paes in the Australian Open.         
	I still have one more match to go, Bhupathi told The Telegraph from Melbourne after partnering Mark Knowles of the Bahamas to reach the mens doubles final in the years first major.         
	Bhupathi and Knowles, seeded three, had a cakewalk in the semi-finals as they defeated Lukasz Kubot of Poland and Oliver Marach of Austria 6-3, 6-1.         
	The Indian has a Wimbledon, a US Open and two French Open titles under his belt, and conquering the Australian Open would put him in an exclusive club.         
	Bhupathis success was followed by the 6-3, 6-3 defeat of Paes and Lukas Dlouhy, of the Czech Republic, to American twins Bob and Mike Bryan in the other semi-final.         
	Asked if he had been looking forward to a clash against his estranged compatriot, Bhupathi said: I am happy that I am in the final. I could not be worrying about who I would be playing against.         
	The conditions have been extreme over the last couple of days in Melbourne with temperatures soaring to 42 degrees centigrade, but fortunately for Bhupathi and Knowles, the organisers closed the Rod Laver arena with the retractable roof.         
	The doubles final is scheduled for Saturday. Before that, Bhupathi has to play the mixed doubles semifinals on Friday when he and Sania Mirza will take on Dlouhy and Iveta Benesova.         
	There was more cheer for the Indian fans as Yuki Bhambri repeated his 2008 performance by reaching the boys singles semi-finals.         
	Unlike Bhupathi, the 16-year-old Bhambri had to toil under the sun for what was nevertheless a sweet 6-1, 7-5 victory over Richard Becker of Germany in the quarter finals.         
	The world No.2 from Delhi then combined with Chinese Taipeis Liang-chi Huang to oust Julien Obry and Adrien Puget of France 7-6(7-4), 6-4 to reach the boys doubles semi-finals.         
	Puget has a chance to avenge his loss as he takes on Bhambri in the singles last-four tie.         
	I was better prepared and more mature on the court this time compared to last year, Bhambri, who won two Grade A titles  the Osaka Mayors Cup and the Orange Bowl  last season, said.

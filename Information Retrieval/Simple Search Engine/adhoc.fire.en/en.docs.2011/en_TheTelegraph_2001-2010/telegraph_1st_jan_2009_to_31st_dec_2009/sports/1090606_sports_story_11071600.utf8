                                                     Gary: This team is really close
            A CORRESPONDENT            Gary Kirsten                           
	Nottingham: Coach Gary Kirsten spoke to the media ahead of Team Indias inaugural match at the World T20 at Trent Bridge on Friday.               
	Following are the excerpts                 
	Is this show of unity a positive or negative sign?         
	Its a huge positive to say that we stand together as a team. When we get accused of infighting, it hurts us. That doesnt happen in this team. Certainly in my time it has never happened It just hurt a little bit We wanted to send a message across that this team is really unified. As MS (Mahendra Singh Dhoni) said, this team is really close We have been for a long time now.         
	Whose decision was it boards, teams or yours?         
	It was a collective decision.         
	Pressure from the Indian media         
	The players get on with what they need to do. The players understand that there is a place for the media. At the same time I think there is responsibility for both sides. We play positive, good cricket and we try and win games of cricket. From the medias side it is important that they report responsibly. If some statement has been made that theres been infighting Its irresponsible.         
	In the background of this issue, what happens now if Sehwag is fit and returns?         
	There is no issue The issue is made up.         
	Is there complete harmony in where he will bat?         
	You must understand that there is a squad of 15. Its important to know that we back everyone in this squad. Unfortunately we can pick only 11 on any given day. But all of them are capable of winning games of cricket and we back everyone. We have to make a choice, as a selection panel, as to who we think is best for the job.         
	Is Sehwag a certainty in the playing XI?         
	No one is certain of a place in the playing XI. Everyone knows that and respects that. We have to make tough decisions when we have got talented cricketers. We go with what we think is the best combination. What really is best about this team is everyone backs everyone else.         
	Is it a risk after all that happened today?         
	It is a risk, but all it has done is made the players more determined. We believe we are right into this tournament now and thats given us more direction in terms of what we need to achieve for the Indian people. We are a unified team and we are proud of the fact that our performances over the last year have been about team unity. We dont play as individuals and we play as a team and we take a lot of pride in that fact.         
	Why did this issue become so big that it required such a gesture from the team?         
	There were individuals who felt that something needed to be done and something needed to be said and hence it was a collective decision To show to the Indian people the unity of our team If they had any doubt that there was infighting in this team.         
	Last one year the team has been united and you have provided the healing touch. Why did the team choose to target certain section of the media, it could have been ignored         
	I think sometimes the media do play an important role in cricket and we all understand that. The media have a responsibility in terms of the message they give out to the Indian people as well And we have a responsibility to show how unified we are in every international we play And we wanted to show the Indian people that we are together because a certain section of the media havent projected it that way.

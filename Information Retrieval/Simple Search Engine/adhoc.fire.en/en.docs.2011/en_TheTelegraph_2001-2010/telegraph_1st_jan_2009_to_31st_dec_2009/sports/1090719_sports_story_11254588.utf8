	Calcutta: Atanu Das and Seema Verma earned India full quota places for the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games at Ogden (Utah) in the US on Friday. The Games qualifying tournament offered a maximum of two places, one each in mens and womens section, to each country. Atanu and Seema stood second and 13th respectively to grab the 17 places available in each category.         
	Only 10 countries  China, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Chinese Taipei and Ukraine, managed to book full quota places. Quota places are allotted to countries and not to individual archers.

	Out of the 84 men and 61 women from 42 countries in the fray, the Indian men  Atanu, Pawan Xalxo and Hemanta Basumatary  did remarkably well. Das moved into the final and ended second best.

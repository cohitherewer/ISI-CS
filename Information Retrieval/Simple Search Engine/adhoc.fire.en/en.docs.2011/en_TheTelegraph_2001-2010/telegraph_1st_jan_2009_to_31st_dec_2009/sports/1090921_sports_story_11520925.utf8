The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I am feeling fit: Sehwag
                                                   I am feeling fit: Sehwag
                      
	Chandigarh: Sidelined from the Indian team for nearly four months due to an injury, flamboyant opener Virender Sehwag Sunday said he is satisfied with the recovery of his shoulder problem and is now desperate to return to the ground.         
	I am feeling fit now. I am raring to go at the bowlers. Whenever given an opportunity, I dont miss the chance of playing, he said on the sidelines of the ongoing JP Atray Memorial cricket tournament.         
	Playing for Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance 1 team, Sehwag made his comeback to the cricket field against BPCL, but failed to open his account, dismissed by Bhavin Thakur.         
	Sehwag also said that he would play for Reliance 1, if the team reached the quarter final stage of the tournament.         
	The right-hander has been out of action for almost four months after undergoing a shoulder operation following an injury he sustained during the second edition of the Indian Premier League in South earlier this year.

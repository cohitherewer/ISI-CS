The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Womens boxing makes Games cut
                                                   Womens boxing makes Games cut
                      
	Berlin: Womens boxing will make its first appearance on the Olympic programme at the London 2012 Games and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announcement Thursday has four-time world champion MC Mary Kom all excited. Mary Kom welcomed the move as a dream come true and vowed to defy age and clinch gold in London.         
	The IOC said the current 11 mens events will be replaced by 10 mens and three womens events at the London Games.         
	The introduction of womens boxing, rejected in the past because of what the IOC said was a limited global appeal, does not need an IOC session approval as the sport is already on the Olympic programme.         
	Women will compete at three weights in London  flyweight (48-51kg), lightweight (56-60kg) and middleweight (69-75kg)  with 12 boxers taking part at each weight.         
	Mary Kom, the 27-year-old mother of two, currently competes in the pin weight 46kg division and would be in her 30s when the London Games are held. (Agencies)

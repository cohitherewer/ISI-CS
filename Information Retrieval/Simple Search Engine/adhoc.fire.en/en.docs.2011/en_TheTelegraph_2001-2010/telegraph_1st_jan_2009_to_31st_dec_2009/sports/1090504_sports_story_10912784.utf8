	Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is ready to see out the rest of his managerial career with the club after reportedly turning down a 40 million offer from Real Madrid.         
	According to The News of the World, Wenger has been a long-term target of Real. Suggestions are that Wenger would have been offered a five-year deal, with bonuses for winning the Champions League and Primera Liga. However, the paper claims Wenger has decided to stay at the Emirates.

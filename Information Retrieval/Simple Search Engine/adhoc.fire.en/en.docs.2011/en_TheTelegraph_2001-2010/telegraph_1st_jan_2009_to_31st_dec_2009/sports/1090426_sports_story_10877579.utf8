The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yusuf puts it down to confidence
                                                     Yusuf puts it down to confidence
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                              
	Cape Town: The sensational Yusuf Pathan, MoM in Thursdays thriller at Newlands, had backed himself to get 16 runs in the IPLs first-ever Super Over showdown.         
	In fact, Irfans elder brother went two better, smashing 18, that too in just four Ajantha Mendis deliveries.         
	Id been confident... The (Kolkata) Knight Riders got 15, which wasnt at all bad and wed been under pressure... However, confidence made the difference, Yusuf told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking after dinner at the unusually named Bihari Indian Restaurant on the Southern Sun Newlands premises, on Friday, he added: The degree of pressure depends on the number of runs scored in the first Super Over... Dono (batsmen, bowlers) pe pressure hota hai, but I knew my target...         
	Asked which hit gave him the most satisfaction, Yusuf, a member of the World T20-winning line-up, laughed and replied: Each one of them... The two sixes, the boundary and the two (off a dropped catch) wed run... I can look back with much happiness...         
	Yusufs become very popular in these parts and the restaurant owner, Englishman David Ross, requested the Rajasthan Royals all-rounder for an autographed jumper.         
	The restaurant, by the way, serves great food (certainly the best Indian stuff in Cape Town) and is run by chefs/cooks from across India. It has three branches.         
	Yashbir Singh, who was once with The Oberoi in Mumbai, heads the restaurants kitchen-team.

                                                   ICC cricket committee gives nod to referrals
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Umpire Decision Review System (UDRS) could become a permanent feature in cricket if the recommendation of the ICCs cricket committee is accepted by the games apex body.         
	The cricket committee, following a two-day meeting that concluded at Lords on Tuesday, advocated the use of the referral system wherein players can challenge an umpires decision during the course of the match.         
	The UDRS, though, wont be in use during the Ashes starting in July, the ICC said.         
	The referral system could be permanently in place from October after the recommendation is accepted by the ICCs chief executives committee and ICC board, which will meet during its annual conference week from June 22-26.         
	Also, the ICC confirmed Tuesday that an independent test has found South African off-spinner Johan Bothas doosra illegal while clearing his off-break and arm-ball as legitimate deliveries.         
	The following are the other major decisions:         
	The committee also considered the desirability of day/night Tests and said that if certain factors, such as trial of an appropriate ball and the interest among spectators, broadcasters and commercial partners were satisfactorily addressed the concept could be further explored.         
	The issue of over-rates was also discussed, and the committee while acknowledging improvements in Test match over-rates in the past 12 months said that the current legislated requirement of 15 overs per hour was realistic and achievable. The committee recommended that if teams, and, in particular captains, fell below these expected levels then stricter penalties should be enforced.         
	It recommended that these should include stricter enforcement of the ICC Code of Conduct and the Laws of Cricket (42.9, Time-wasting by the fielding side and 42.10, Batsman wasting time) and a doubling of fines for a failure to maintain the required over-rates.         
	It also recommended that if a captain led a team that received three over-rate fines in the same format of the game in any 12-month period then he should automatically face a suspension.         
	The committee supported the MCCs recent decision that there was no need to impose a limit on the weight and depth of bats. The committee also agreed with the MCC that the double-sided bat and the switch-hit should be considered legal.

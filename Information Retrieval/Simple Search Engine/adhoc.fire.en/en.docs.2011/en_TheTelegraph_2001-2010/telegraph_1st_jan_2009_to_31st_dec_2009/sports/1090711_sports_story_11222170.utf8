            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Defending champions India will face a tough challenge when the Nehru Cup international tournaments kicks off at the Ambedkar Stadium on August 19.         
	According to sources, out of five teams invited to play in the six-nation meet, two are ranked higher than the hosts in the latest Fifa ranking.         
	The 14th edition of the Nehru Cup, however, will remain an all-Asian meet for the second time in a row.         
	The five teams who are likely to take part are  Syria, Thailand, Lebanon, Sri Lanka and Kyrgyzstan. In case of any team failing to turn up at the last moment, Palestine may come in as a replacement.         
	Among the six teams, Syria are the best placed in the Fifa list. Ranked 96th , the finalists of the last Nehru Cup are the only team in the tournament to be among 100 in the Fifa rankings.         
	In 2007, India beat Syria in the final after losing to them in the group league.         
	After Syria, Thailand should be the best team in the tournament.         
	Ranked 117, the last time Thailand played in the Nehru Cup was in 1995 when Bhaichung Bhutia made his debut for the national team. Thailand routed India 5-0 at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	Six teams are likely to be divided into two groups. Top two teams from each group will make the semi-finals. The final is on August 31.

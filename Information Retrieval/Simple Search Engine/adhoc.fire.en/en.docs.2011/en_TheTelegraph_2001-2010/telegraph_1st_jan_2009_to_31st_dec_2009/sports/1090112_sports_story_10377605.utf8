The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I never resigned, says Pietersen
                                                   I never resigned, says Pietersen
                      
	London: The turmoil in English cricket continues with Kevin Pietersen claiming that he never resigned as captain and that he wants to be back at the helm as there was unfinished business to take care of.         
	Im not finished as England skipper. I feel Ive got unfinished business as captain of England  I definitely feel that, Pietersen declared in an interview with an English daily. Pietersens five-month reign as England captain ended after a breakdown of his relationship with coach Peter Moores, who was also sacked.         
	The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) was apparently unhappy with Pietersen for issuing an either-me-or-him ultimatum.         
	In my email, I said that I cant lead this team forward and take it to the West Indies if Peter Moores is coach. I did say that, yes, he said.         
	Pietersen said the ECB took that e-mail for a resignation but did not tell him that Moores had been sacked. I havent had any reasons for why I was asked to stand down  and I still havent. My phone rang. It was Hugh Morris (ECB managing director). He said they had had an emergency board meeting and they had accepted my resignation. I said: Excuse me?! They said: Weve accepted your resignation. I said on what basis has it been accepted? They had no answer. Next, I received an email from the ECB saying: Your resignation is of immediate effect, recalled the 28-year-old.         
	The left-hander said the ECBs attitude had hurt and disillusioned him. I wasnt told in the telephone conversation or the email that Peter Moores wasnt coach. I was told that your resignation was accepted yet I hadnt been told he had been sacked or asked to resign, he said.         
	I thought that one of us had to go, sure. And I would have had no problem if they had decided it was me and Moores stayed, he added. I only found out the following afternoon and I thought What is going on? I still dont understand why it happened like that and I still havent been given a reason. I was surprised because after that phone call I thought Moores was still in the job, with them taking my resignation because of the strategy I had drawn up and my conclusion. So when they got rid of Moores I did ask the question  but got absolutely nothing, he claimed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger aims to tame in-form Ogilvy
                                                   Tiger aims to tame in-form Ogilvy
                      
	Miami: World number one Tiger Woods will have to contend with the hottest player in the game when he continues his comeback from reconstructive knee surgery at this weeks WGC-CA Championship.         
	Australian Geoff Ogilvy is set to launch his title defence in Thursdays opening round at the Doral Golf Resort where he will be bidding for a fourth tournament win in eight starts.         
	Ogilvy clinched his third World Golf Championships (WGC) crown at this months Match Play Championship.         
	Its exciting to defend a golf tournament, to go back to where youve played well, said Ogilvy, who faces a strong field of 80 including the worlds top 20 players. I played well the year before too, so the last couple of years Ive had a great time at Doral. Its one of the biggest tournaments in the world and Im really looking forward to it, the Australian told reporters after crushing Britains Paul Casey in the Match Play Championship final.         
	While Ogilvys three WGC wins make him the second most successful player since the elite events were launched in 1999, the pace-setting Woods has piled up a remarkable 15 victories.         
	This week, however, will be his first strokeplay tournament since his astonishing playoff win at the US Open in June. Woods made his hotly anticipated return to the PGA Tour at the Match Play Championship in Arizona where he was encouraged by his form, despite losing to South African Tim Clark in the second round.         
	I was very pleased with the way I hit the golf ball, he said. After walking down the cart paths and playing, getting some rhythm of playing, I had no soreness, no pain. Now its just a matter of getting back, and playing more rounds.           (REUTERS)

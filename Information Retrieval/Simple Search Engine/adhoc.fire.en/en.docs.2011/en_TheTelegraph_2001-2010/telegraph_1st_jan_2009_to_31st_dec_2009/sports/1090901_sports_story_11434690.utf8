	New York: Four years and one baby later, Kim Clijsters still looks like a contender.         
	The 2005 US Open champion cruised through her return to Grand Slam tennis Monday, defeating Viktoriya Kutuzova 6-1, 6-1 in the opening round in Arthur Ashe Stadium.         
	It was Clijsterss first Grand Slam match since the 2007 Australian Open, after which she retired to start a family. She had a baby girl in May 2008, but recently decided to return to competitive tennis.         
	It has been a good return thus far, one that has included four wins over top-20 opponents in two tournaments in August. Granted, this was only the first round of the US Open, but her 58-minute win over Kutuzova included very few signs of rust.         
	She won the first seven and last 11 points of the match and grinded through her few hiccups, including three double-faults in the third game of the opening set, which extended to seven deuces before she pulled it out.         
	The win guaranteed shell be ranked at least 148th after the Open, when shell have played the three required tournaments she needs to return to the list.         
	Other winners in the first round included 8th-seeded Victoria Azarenka, 12th-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska and 26th-seeded Francesca Schiavone. Five-time defending champion Roger Federer was scheduled to play NCAA champion Devin Britton later Monday.         
	The Williams sisters were both on the schedule, as were Andy Roddick and James Blake.         
	Another American, Sam Querrey, will debut later this week, bringing with him some lofty expectations  notably, that he might be the next great American tennis star in a country that is looking for just that.         
	Everyone is doing what they can, said Querrey, who is seeded 22nd. A lot of times, even if you go back 100 years, youll have a period of 10 years where youll have four or five guys in the top 10, and then years where you might just have one guy. Its kind of like a rolling wave.         
	As much as anywhere else, the search for Americas next great player resonates here at Arthur Ashe Stadium, inside the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, home of Americas Grand Slam. Its the place where Connors and McEnroe, Chrissy and Tracy Austin, ruled during a golden era that feels more like ancient history with each passing year.         
	Patrick McEnroe is in charge of putting together the program that will keep the pipeline filled, with hopes of producing multiple stars in the future. I think its going in the right direction, Roddick said. The present belongs  could belong, that is  to guys like John Isner (ranked 55th), Donald Young (185) and Jesse Levine (135). No. 25 seed Mardy Fish is on this list, too, but the 27-year-old withdrew Sunday with a rib injury. And Querrey.         
	He stands 6-foot-6 and ranks third on tour with 696 aces this year, a stat that is allowing him to become more aggressive in his return game, as well, because hes more confident about holding serve.         
	He is 21-6 since Wimbledon and has played in four finals, including a victory in Los Angeles. He won the US Open Series, a grouping of hard-court tournaments leading up to this week. That pushed his ranking from barely inside the top 50 to a career-best 22nd. It also earned him a chance for a $1 million bonus if he wins the Open.         
	His biggest win this summer was a 7-6 (13- 1), 7-6 (7-3) victory over Roddick, one that may not signal Querrey is ready to rise all the way to the top, but certainly serves as a confidence builder.         
	It also helps if you play Federer or Nadal, Querrey said. Andys beaten those guys. Hey, he did it, I beat him, why cant I beat those guys? So it kind of gives you that extra edge against them, too.

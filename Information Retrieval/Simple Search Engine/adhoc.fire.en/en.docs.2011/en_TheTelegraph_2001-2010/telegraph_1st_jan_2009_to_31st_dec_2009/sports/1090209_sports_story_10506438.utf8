    - Debutant Ravindra Jadeja impresses with unbeaten 60           A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Mahendra Singh Dhoni with the winners trophy in Colombo on Sunday. (Reuters)                                 
	Calcutta/Colombo: Sri Lanka salvaged some pride with a consolation 68-run win in the fifth and final one-day International on Sunday to break Indias record-breaking sequence of nine consecutive ODI triumphs.         
	The defeat meant India could not make a clean sweep of the series and had to be content with a 4-1 victory in the five-ODI series.         
	Sri Lankan opener Tillekeratne Dilshan missed a century by just three runs and Kumar Sangakkara hit 84 while spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan regained form just in time for the hosts to avoid a series whitewash.         
	Half centuries from Yuvraj Singh (73), debutant Ravindra Jadeja (60 ..) and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (53) were not enough as the Indian top order failed to click. The visitors were rolled over with seven balls to spare, chasing Sri Lankas challenging 320 for eight on a batting track.         
	The Indians went into the final match without key players Sachin Tendulkar and Zaheer Khan. They also decided to rest spinner Pragyan Ojha and were thus without a regular spinner on Sunday.         
	Dhoni admitted his team lacked strength in the bowling department. Our bowling was not as strong today. But it was good to give the guys who have not played a chance. (Ravindra) Jadeja was brilliant today, Dhoni said during the post-match presentation ceremony.         
	India got off to a shaky start with opener Virender Sehwag dismissed cheaply by Thilan Thushara. Sehwag played a poor shot after hitting the bowler for a four on the previous ball.         
	Suresh Raina, who walked in at number three, also fell cheaply and at that stage India were tottering at nine for two wickets, chasing the mammoth target.         
	The other opener Gautam Gambhir, who made 150 in the fourth ODI, also buckled under pressure and was out for 13 off Nuwan Kulasekara. Rohit Sharma fell for 15.         
	Yuvraj gave some stability to the run chase after his side were reduced to 85 for four inside the 15th over. India, however, struggled for the rest of the match as they kept losing wickets at regular intervals.         
	Indias hopes suffered a further jolt when Yuvraj offered a return catch to Muralidharan which the veteran off-spinner gleefully accepted.         
	The Punjab batsman, who was adjudged Man of the Series for his superb display with the bat, hit 11 boundaries and a six during his innings on Sunday.         
	Sri Lanka did everything right as Jayawardene called the coin correctly for the first time in the series and then openers Dilshan and veteran Sanath Jayasuriya provided a rollicking start to the Sri Lankan innings.         
	Jayasuriyas quick-fire 37 (off 35 balls) set the pace for the home teams innings. Dilshan (97) missed his century as he was run out by Rohit Sharma.         
	Man of the Match Sangakkaras 84 came in 70 balls, and he hit eight boundaries and a six during his innings. He upped the tempo for the home side and truly laid the foundation for a 300-plus total.         
	Ishant Sharma and Yuvraj were the pick of the Indian bowlers with three for 60 and two for 39 respectively.         
	Sri Lanka captain Jayawardene rightly praised his top-order bastmen for the consolation win. We had spoken to the guys. We were disappointed after the four defeats. I think the wicket played a big role... Sanath (Jayasuriya) and (Tillekeratne) Dilshan gave us a good platform to push for 300 and once we reached there we had the advantage.         
	Jayawardene also credited the Indians for their superb performance in the series.         
	They are one of the best teams in the world now. Credit to India, they played really well. We were up against a really good side. Theyre the deserving winners, Jayawardene said.         
	Dhoni dedicated the series triumph to his teammates and stressed on the importance of a healthy dressing room atmosphere.         
	A positive frame of mind is very important. If the dressing room atmosphere is good then it brings out more talent. I want to dedicate this win to my teammates. Theyre brilliant They are with me whenever I need them, the wicketkeeper batsman said.         
	Meanwhile, Sundays defeat cost India their second place in the ICC ODI rankings as they were overtaken by Australia after the world champions beat New Zealand in Sydney in the third ODI of the five-match series.

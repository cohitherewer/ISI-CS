The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sehwag: I was confident of chasing down any total
                                                     Sehwag: I was confident of chasing down any total
  - We found a lot of positives from this match, says losing captain Yuvraj               Virender Sehwag in a belligerent mood in Cape Town on Sunday. (AP)                           
	Cape Town: Rain interruption and the Duckworth-Lewis method might have made things easier for Delhi DareDevils in their first Indian Premier League (IPL) match, but Delhi DareDevils captain Virender Sehwag said he was confident of chasing down the original total.         
	According to the Duckworth-Lewis method, Delhi DareDevils target was revised from 105 in 12 overs to 54 of six overs and Sehwag (38) and Gautam Gambhir (15) played sensibly to score the runs in 4.5 overs to help the team beat Kings XI Punjab by 10 wickets in the rain-truncated match.         
	I wasnt worried (about the score) because I expected them to score 120 runs and was prepared for that and with the sort of batting we have, I was confident we can chase anything around 120-130, Sehwag said.         
	We were chasing 100-something runs and I told Gautam to play all of the 12 overs so that I can go after the bowling and we can build a partnership. That is exactly what Gautam did, he added.         
	Sehwag hoped to keep the momentum going and play in the final next month.         
	Yes, we are hoping (to play in final). If we can play the same kind of cricket, we can play the final, he said.         
	Kings XI Punjab captain Yuvraj Singh said they lost the momentum after the initial start and felt the Duckworth-Lewis method put the DareDevils in an advantageous position.         
	We had a good momentum going but after seven overs, we lost a few wickets and lost the momentum and thus the game changed. Duckworth-Lewis is handy for the team batting second. It is always advantageous to the chasing team but we cant do much about that. We are happy with the start. Of course we can take some positives out of this match and we have enough games coming up. So were looking forward to those, Yuvraj said.         
	Asked when Brett Lee is expected to play, Yuvraj said: He (Brett Lee) is very close to playing actually. I mean, as soon as he is 100 per cent fit, he is gonna come and play for us.         
	Meanwhile, Man of the match Daniel Vettori, who scalped three wickets for 15 runs for the DareDevils, said spinners will play a crucial role in this IPL as they have adapted to the conditions better than anybody else.         
	I didnt see (Anil) Kumble bowl but I saw (Shane) Warne bowling, the wicket looks very good and I think the spinners would play a huge role, Vettori said.         
	Spinners adapted really quickly, more than anybody else, and they realised what their strengths are. We are playing in small grounds and generally, the wickets are good for batting. So the spinners have done a good job so far, he added.           (PTI)

                                                   EB miss out on Oscar
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: In yet another setback for East Bengal, Andorra captain Oscar Sonejee has decided to favour Churchill Brothers over the Calcutta club in the ongoing I-League.         
	Sonejee, who has earned more than 80 caps for Andorra, was earlier set to join East Bengal as their Player of Indian Origin (PIO).         
	Sources in Churchill Brothers confirmed the move on Monday saying the 33-year-old footballer should be arriving in Goa this week to start practising with the I-League champions.         
	The main reason for Sonejee deserting East Bengal at the last moment is believed to be his desire to stay close to Mumbai, where his in-laws have settled down.         
	The Andorra player is married to a girl from the western metropolis.

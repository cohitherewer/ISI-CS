The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Muniyappa set to   realise dream 
                                                                                                                                   Muniyappa set to   realise dream 
                            
	Shanghai: Caddie-turned-pro C. Muniyappa is finding it hard to believe that he will be rubbing shoulders with golfing greats like Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson in the WGC-HSBC Champions golf starting Thursday.         
	The 32-year-old Indian Open champion will join compatriots Jeev Milkha Singh, Jyoti Randhawa and Gaganjeet Bhullar in the historic first edition of a World Golf Championship event in Asia.         
	Muniyappas secured participation in the showpiece event by virtue of occupying the sixth place on the Order of Merit at the cut-off point for qualifying. My dream has always been to play with Tiger. I cant imagine Im going to be in the same event with him, Muniyappa said Tuesday.         
	Last year, I was watching the big events on TV and I saw Jeev winning in Singapore. I asked myself when I would have the chance to play in such big events and worked really hard. Now, Im here, he added.         
	Tiger Woods, for his part, makes a third trip to Shanghai this week still looking for a first HSBC Champions title but now with the added incentive of bagging what would be his 17th World Golf Championship (WGC) victory.         
	The world No.1 compared this years elevation of the $7 million tournament to one of the four annual WGC events and the first in Asia with last months vote to include golf in the Olympics.         
	Olympic status will help grow the sport in so many of the emerging golf markets, including China. But holding our first WGC event here is another key moment, Woods, second in both of his previous attempts to win the title, said in a news release.         
	The tournament also offers Woods a chance to dole out a double dose of revenge on Yang Yong-eun, who held off the American to win the 2006 title and then repeated his feat to become Asias first major champion in August.         
	Muniyappa is among 11 Asian Tour members who will tee off at the Sheshan International Golf Club on Thursday.         
	For a man who caddied for Re 1 in his childhood, Muniyappa has had the opportunity to shoot for a staggering $13 million over the past three weeks on the Tour.         
	Im going to try play my best golf here. I feel lucky to be here, said the Bangalorean.         
	Meanwhile, Bhullar, a talented 21-year-old who won the Indonesia President Invitational in July, said he would try and emulate Jeev and Randhawa.Four Indians in a WGC event, its the first time in history.         
	It feels good to be in a WGC event. The last two years, Ive worked really hard and I want to work harder to get into contention at the big events, Bhullar said.           (AGENCIES)

                                                     East face Wests batting might
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Ranadeb                           
	Mumbai: East Zone face a formidable challenge as they take on a strong West Zone in the Duleep Trophy semi-finals starting here Thursday.         
	The hosts batting line up consists of the seasons leading run-getters  Mumbai captain Wasim Jaffer, teammate Ajinkya Rahane and Saurashtras Cheteshwar Pujara  while the bowling is led by Dhawal Kulkarni, the highest-wicket taker so far.         
	Its a challenge for all of us. The first session will be crucial since there will be some movement. We also have to adjust to the Kookaburra ball. So, the toss will be vital, East skipper Shiv Sundar Das of Orissa said on the eve of match at the Brabourne Stadium.         
	The visitors will rely on Bengals Manoj Tiwary who scored a valiant hundred in the Ranji Trophy quarter finals to provide the batting impetus, and his teammate Ranadeb Bose to spearhead the pace attack.         
	Both the teams could pick a three-pronged pace attack as the CCI pitch has traditionally offered a lot of bounce. Both the Ranji Trophy matches played at the venue this season have thrown up an outright winner.         
	Bengals Ashok Dinda, among the leading bowlers this season with 39 scalps, is likely to handle the new ball with Bose while Orissas Basanth Mohanty, who has dismissed 28 batsmen at 21.28, could be the first change bowler.         
	Both Das and his counterpart Jaffer preferred to keep their cards close to their chests on Wednesday. Das has the additional challenge of make his team a cohesive unit since his team has players from six states whereas West Zone has five players from Mumbai whom Jaffer led to their 38th Ranji title earlier this month. The coach, too, is a Mumbai staff, Pravin Amre.         
	Given the pitch, one can expect a five-bowler combination to be fielded by West.         
	Probably Siddharth (Trivedi), Dhawal (Kulkarni) and (Samad) Fallah will be the three pacers. If we go in for five bowlers, there will be at least two spinners. But we havent decided the XI yet, Jaffer said.         
	For slow bowling, Jaffer has the option of Ramesh Powar and Rajesh Pawar while Das has Tripuras offie Jayanta Debnath. He can also use Tiwary as a leg-spinner.         
	With the tournament being played in the knockout format, one of the teams would be eliminated after just one match. With the tours of New Zealand and India A coming up, players might be tempted to put individual record ahead of the teams.         
	In the other semi-final, South Zone will take on North Zone in Rajkot from Thursday.

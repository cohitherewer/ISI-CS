The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Players attitude spoilt: Shetty
                                                     Players attitude spoilt: Shetty
    - Top BCCI official lays bare the ugly side of cash-rich IPL           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              The April 23, 2009 story in The Telegraph      
	Calcutta: The Indian Premier League (IPL) has done quite a few things.         
	It has, for example, boosted the bank balances of select cricketers, revived the careers of Amit Mishra and Shane Watson, introduced cheerleaders and enhanced Lalit Modis image.         
	You cant, of course, miss the IPL chairman and commissioner as hes on the screen nearest to you after almost every four or six.         
	In fact, if Madhur Bhandarkar gets the script right, then Modi may soon even be at a multiplex near you!         
	Till the IPL got rolling, in April 2008, Modi had been nothing but an ambitious mandarin. All that has changed.         
	The IPL, therefore, does have a long list of beneficiaries.         
	However, the question is: Has the multi-million dollar event actually benefited Indian cricket?         
	Six months after The Telegraphs Easy IPL money taking its toll story from Cape Town, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)s chief administrative officer, Prof. Ratnakar Shetty, has confirmed that the negatives outweigh the positives.         
	One of the senior players called up after the Champions Trophy and said that the other players (namely youngsters) did not feel it (the loss) as much as him... He added there was no feeling whether we win or not... That there is no sadness (after losing)...         
	These are the things that we (in the BCCI) need to look at... You can see the change in attitude and focus which (after the IPL) seems to have gone to things other than cricket...         
	They are attracted by the different (Bollywood) style of entertainment, which is part of such events... This is worrisome... Some of the youngsters have become very big...         
	Some of them feel that playing in the Ranji Trophy is not as important as playing in the IPL... The BCCI will have to see that they (youngsters) can handle these things, Prof. Shetty said at a function in Mumbai on Monday evening.         
	Six months ago, one of his colleagues (who didnt wish to be identified) had told this newspaper: The IPL is totally ruining the emerging players, particularly bowlers...                   Prof. Ratnakar Shetty    
	Its because of the IPL that some players who got fat sums, either in the inaugural auction (last year) or through negotiations with certain franchises, are just not keen on going through the grind of domestic cricket...         
	Somebody has to review this whole business...         
	Its fine for the players to earn money, but the IPL has changed the lifestyle of some so fast that they arent able to cope with it... Perhaps, they arent looking at a career beyond a couple of seasons of T20...         
	The BCCI didnt react then, but when somebody as senior as Prof. Shetty (incidentally, also the tournament director of the 2011 World Cup) has gone on record, then it cant afford to stay silent.         
	A damage control exercise will probably be initiated, not that Prof. Shetty has spoken anything which isnt being talked about in private.         
	Significantly, BCCI secretary N. Srinivasans India Cements owns the Chennai Super Kings, one of the eight IPL franchises, so hes bound to feel somewhat uncomfortable.         
	What should really worry everybody is the lack of passion among some of those wearing the India cap now.         
	This isnt a recent development, but has gone to another level after the IPL came on the scene.         
	If defeats dont hurt, then what will?         
	Prof. Shetty couldnt have chosen a better time to get candid with a capital C. One hopes hes not made to pay for that.         
	Footnote: The first two editions of the IPL have not produced a single player who is a Team India regular. Pragyan Ojha has been dropped; Manpreet Gony forgotten; Abhishek Nayar and Ravindra Jadeja are, at best, cricketers with potential...

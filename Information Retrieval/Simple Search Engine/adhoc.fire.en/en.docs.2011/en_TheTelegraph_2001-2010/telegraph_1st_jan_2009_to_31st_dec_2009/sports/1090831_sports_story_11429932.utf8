            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Air India made a good start to their IFA Shield campaign, winning 2-1 in their opening group league match against Pune FC at the Howrah Stadium on Sunday.         
	Nigerian Dbuisi Opara drew first blood for the airmen in the 10th minute, netting from a rebound while Ravinder Singh converted a 56th-minute penalty to wrap up the points for the Mumbai side.         
	The Pune outfit equalised through Izumi Arata in the 48th minute. Pune FC who had all three foreigners  Ivory Coasts Douhou Pierre, Nigerias Chika Wali and new recruit Uzbekistans Sergey Tokov and Player of Indian Origin Arata from Japan  mucked around the pitch, which deteriorated as the game matured.         
	Punes defence appeared too weak to match Air Indias back to back forays while upfront, Jeje Lalpekhlua squandered two easy chances. However, Pune regrouped in the second half and netted the equaliser three-minutes from the breather.

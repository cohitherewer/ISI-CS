                                                   Knights get stuck in the lift 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A few players of the Kolkata Knight Riders, including former captain Sourav Ganguly and pacer Ishant Sharma, were Monday stuck for more than 15 minutes in their hotel lift.         
	The Knight Riders registered only their second victory in this edition of the Indian Premier League when they defeated the Chennai Super Kings in a sensational last-ball thriller on Monday.         
	The incident happened after the players returned to the Sandton Sun in Johannesburg. It is learnt a few of the Chennai Super Kings players were also in the lift. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief when the lift started working on its own.         
	The incident was put down to a snag. Although the players must have had a claustrophobic 15 minutes inside the lift, the Knights director of cricket operations, John Buchanan ensured the memories were captured on his handy cam.

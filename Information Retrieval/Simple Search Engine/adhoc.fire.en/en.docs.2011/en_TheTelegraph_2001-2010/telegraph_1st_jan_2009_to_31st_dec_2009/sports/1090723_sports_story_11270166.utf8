The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal have two in hand before Ranji
                                                   Bengal have two in hand before Ranji
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal will play only two tournaments  JP Atray in Chandigarh and Moin-ud Dowlah Gold Cup in Hyderabad  in the lead up to the forthcoming Ranji season.         
	The KSCA tournament in Bangalore begins from August 1 and the Buchibabu is only limited to local teams this season. So we have to do with the JP Atray and Moin-ud Dowlah meets, said a CAB official on Wednesday.         
	The CAB, however, wasnt very keen on playing in Chandigarh as it is a one-day tournament.         
	It is likely that the AN Ghosh meet may be held as a season opener on the local circuit before the Challenger to test the players fitness and skills prior to the Ranji season.         
	The focus will be on the Indian Cricket League players who will be making a comeback at the national level after being granted amnesty by the BCCI.         
	We need to judge the players temperament and mental approach in advance They have been out of the longer version of the game for sometime now, said chief selector Sambaran Banerjee.         
	Once the probables  which could be limited to 25 players  are picked in the first week of August, it is likely that some of the seniors may be given a break from the Chandigarh and Hyderabad meets.         
	Players who have played continuously last season, like Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Ranadeb Bose, may be given a break It will also give us a chance to test the juniors and the rookies in tough match situations, said Sambaran.

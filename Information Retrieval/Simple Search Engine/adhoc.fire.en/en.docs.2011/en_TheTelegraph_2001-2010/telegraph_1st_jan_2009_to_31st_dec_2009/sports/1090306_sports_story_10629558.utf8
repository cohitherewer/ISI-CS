The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Batting prowess gives Team India the edge
                                                   Batting prowess gives Team India the edge
                            
	Wellington: India will rely on their high-octane batting to continue their winning ways as they go into the second cricket one-dayer against New Zealand here on Friday with injured pacer Ishant Sharmas fitness being the only concern.         
	Indias batting, which had come a cropper in the T20s, revved up into top gear with Virender Sehwag, Suresh Raina and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni notching up half centuries in the first ODI at Napier.         
	Yuvraj Singh, Sachin Tendulkar, Gautam Gambhir and Yusuf Pathan have also been striking the ball well. Even if two of these celebrated batsmen last out the innings, the Black Caps would find the going extremely tough, despite playing in home conditions.         
	Ishant, who is nursing a shoulder injury, is the only the concern ahead of the clash but the team management chose to play the cards close to its chest, saying a final decision on the bowlers availability would be taken only before the toss.         
	Though Ishant bowled in practice, the team management does not seem inclined to risk the lean and mean 20-year-old bowler. India would rather have him 100 per cent fit for the rest of the series.         
	Ishants return would empower the Indian attack, which had routed New Zealand at Napier. But if he doesnt, it would perhaps put Dhoni in a predicament.         
	The Indian captain had hinted at a change in guard in the seam attack, obviously disturbed by Munaf Patels insipid two-over spell at the McClean Park. It wouldnt be a surprise if Dhoni replaces Munaf with either Irfan Pathan or left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha. New Zealand has its own injury concerns and they have already made it clear that wicketkeeper-batsman Brendon McCullum, who had injured his right hand thumb during the first ODI, would play as a specialist batsman.         
	The home side has also drafted in Peter McGlashan, whose sister Sarah plays for New Zealands women team, as a specialist wicketkeeper in the 13-member squad.         
	Captain Daniel Vettori realises that if India extend their lead on Friday, it would be a Herculean task for New Zealand to comeback into the five-match series.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Raul stars in Real victory
                                                   Raul stars in Real victory
                      
	Madrid: Raul Gonzalez scored a hat-trick as Real Madrid beat Sevilla 4-2 to close within four points of Spanish leaders Barcelona after a record eighth straight road victory.         
	Juande Ramos was on Sunday without regulars Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder and Gabriel Heinze due to injury.         
	Defender Pepe is also banned for 10 games for lashing out at two Getafe opponents in Madrids last game, and he was certainly missed during Renatos opening goal in the 16th minute.         
	But Raul equalised by redirecting Christoph Metzelders centre over Sevilla goalkeeper Andres Palop on the stroke of halftime.         
	The Madrid captain then volleyed in Miguel Torres deflected cross in the 63rd before taking his goal tally for the season to 18 three minutes later by poking in a loose ball that Palop failed to smother.         
	Diego Capel pulled one back for Sevilla 10 minutes from time after Sergio Ramos had failed to clear a cross into the area, but Marcelo sealed the victory with Madrids fourth deep into injury time.

	Cuttack: Captain Wasim Jaffer starred with a century as West Zone clinched their ninth Deodhar Trophy title, outplaying East Zone by 218 runs in the final of the Zonal One-Dayers here Wednesday.         
	Electing to bat, Jaffers 108-ball 116 and Cheteshwar Pujaras 86-ball 94 set the foundation for West Zones mammoth total of 362. In reply, East Zone crumbled to 144 in 39.4 overs. Ravindra Jadeja and Abhishek Nayar blew away the struggling East attack, scoring 99 runs in the last seven overs.         
	East Zone, who made a surprise move in the morning, opting to play with an extra batsman (Halhadhar Das), clearly missed a fifth bowler. Bowling six overs, skipper Manoj Tiwary conceded 68 runs at a rate of 11.33, while Deepak Sharma gave away 37 runs from his five overs.         
	Having led Mumbai to their 38th Ranji Trophy triumph this season, Jaffer anchored the West innings perfectly, especially after their top order failed to give them a decent start. Openers Parthiv Patel and Ajinkya Rahane departed quickly with the teams score at 40 for two in 8.1 overs.         
	Rakesh Solanki, who replaced Bhavik Thaker, was also dismissed in quick succession and it was left to the experienced pair of Jaffer and Pujara to do the repair work.         
	Jaffer, who is the leading run-getter this domestic season, got good support from Pujara, who is incidentally the third highest-run scorer. Having been dropped twice  on 25 and 49  Jaffer prospered with each delivery and went on to complete his half-century in 41 balls.         
	The former India opener first got a life when he was dropped by Wriddhiman Saha of Ranadeb Boses bowling early in the ninth over. One run shy of his half-century, Jaffer got another breather when he was dropped by Dhiraj Goswami off his own bowling.         
	Jaffer and Pujara added 158 runs for the fourth wicket as the former India opener notched his sixth List A century in 95 balls. He milked the East bowling at ease. The Mumbai captain hit 15 fours and one six as East sorely missed a back-up bowler.         
	Pujara was a shade quicker than Jaffer and went on to hit two sixes and seven fours. After Jaffers departure, Ravindra Jadeja and Abhishek Nayar left the East bowlers scurrying for cover. The East bowlers ended up conceding 113 runs in the last 10 overs.         
	East never had it easy chasing the huge total. Wriddhiman, who had a glorious run so far, departed for two. Ishank Jaggi, the centurion against North Zone, fell for eight while Tiwary made 24 as wickets fell at regular intervals.

	Durban: Last years runners-up the Chennai Super Kings will look to maintain their winning momentum after bouncing back from their opening match defeat as they take on the Delhi DareDevils in their Indian Premier League (IPL) match here Thursday.         
	The Super Kings had a shaky start when they lost to the Mumbai Indians in the IPL opener but Mahendra Singh Dhonis men bounced back in the next match, drubbing the Royal Challengers Bangalore by 92 runs.         
	With purple cap holder Australian Matthew Hayden in great touch even after his retirement, the Super Kings batting firepower is no less formidable than the batting line-up of the DareDevils. So cracker of a match is on the cards Thursday.         
	Hayden, the current leading scorer, smashed the second fastest half-century in the IPL en route to his 35-ball 65, and partnered Parthiv Patel, plundering 106 runs for the first wicket against the Bangalore side. Chennai have some fine all-rounders in Englands Andrew Flintoff and South Africas Albie Morkel, and with left-hander Suresh Raina also finding his form with a valuable 28 against Bangalore, there doesnt seem to be any major chink in their batting resources.         
	The DareDevils have also some in-form batsmen in their ranks in captain Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir.         
	Even though the rain Gods played a role in the win, Sehwag had made it clear that they have the firepower to chase down the original score of 104 in 12 overs.         
	The punditss favourites, Delhi also boast of some quality players like big-hitter David Warner and old warhorse Glenn McGrath, who are still to make an appearance in the second edition of the Twenty20 extravaganza.         
	Among pacers, the DareDevils will depend on the exuberance of Indian youngsters Pradeep Sangwan, V. Yo Mahesh and Australian Dirk Nannes, while the Super Kings will have to depend on Manpreet Gony, Laxmipathi Balaji and all-rounders Flintoff and Morkel.         
	Delhi may be tempted to bring in Australians David Warner and Glenn McGrath but otherwise there is no need for any changes. If Warner plays, Tillekaratne Dilshan would make way from the middle order and Gautam Gambhir would slip down to No. 3. Given they are playing in-form Chennai, Delhi may opt for the experience of McGrath. Dirk Nannes would then warm the bench.         
	Thursdays match would also be a clash between two world-class spinners  New Zealander Daniel Vettori and Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralidharan. (PTI)

                                                   Kevin to lead
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Bangalore: England batsman Kevin Pietersen will lead Bangalore Royal Challengers during the second edition of the Indian Premier League, team owner Vijay Mallya said Saturday. He takes over from Rahul Dravid.         
	Mallya said the former India captain may not be available for the entire tournament because of personal reasons.         
	South Africas Jacques Kallis will take over as captain in May when Pietersen leaves to fulfil his national commitments.         
	The Bangalore franchise has a pool of 42 players, including 10 foreigners and 16 new recruits.         
	The team wasnt properly balanced last year, said Mallya. (Coach) Ray Jennings has brought about an element of bonding.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav may take guard again
                                                   Sourav may take guard again
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The 2009-10 season may actually see Sourav Ganguly wearing Bengal colours once again.         
	The former India captain is open to the idea of playing a few of the four-day Ranji Trophy matches provided, of course, the state selectors are keen to have him in the team.         
	At the moment I havent spoken to anybody, but Ill definitely be speaking to the selectors, and if Im required, then I wont mind playing a few matches, Sourav told The Telegraph late on Wednesday.         
	The former India captain, who retired from first class cricket after helping Bengal reach the Elite group last season, added: The 2009-10 season is again a very crucial one for Bengal and were in a tough group. So, if Im required, Ill be there.         
	Bengal are clubbed with Uttar Pradesh, Saurashtra, Karnakata, Maharashtra, Baroda and Delhi in group B of the Elite division this season.         
	Asked whether making a comeback for Bengal would be a step towards aiming for a Team India comeback, Sourav emphatically said, no.         
	Sourav had earlier said that he might make himself available for a few of the Vijay Hazare Trophy matches this time too. Besides, he is also set to play the third edition of the Indian Premier League for the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla was ecstatic. Dadi making a comeback is big news. It will be great for Bengal A huge plus for Bengal cricket It will be of great advantage if he turns out this season, Shukla said.         
	Selector Devang Gandhi was also happy. With the world of experience Souravs presence brings to the team, it will definitely help Bengal cricket, he said.         
	The CAB, however, refused to comment. Joint secretary Biswarup Dey said: He hasnt told us anything It wont be fair to make a comment based on media statements.         
	Sourav had quit international cricket on a high in November 2008 after the home series against Australia.

                                                   Strategy baffles English media
            OUR BUREAU                      
	There was very little that England did wrong in Sundays inspiring three-run victory over India and were deservedly praised at length by the English media on Monday. Mahendra Singh Dhonis men were criticised for their tactics.               
	The following is what some of them had to say (alphabetically)         
	DAILY MAIL: Even the partisan India crowd at Lords Sunday could not spur their boys on to victory against an England side intent on stamping their authority on the game. There were some strange decisions by both captains, particularly the promotion of (Dimitri) Mascarenhas up the order by England and Indias baffling decision to put (Ravindra) Jadeja in to bat before Yuvraj Singh or MS Dhoni.         
	THE DAILY TELEGRAPH: Dhoni is a thinker as captain, but his mind games were hardly subtle. He tossed the ball to Yuvraj to renew last winters Clash of the Egos with (Kevin) Pietersen. KP was the winner this time England had just enough to cling on and leave a billion pundits to ponder over Indias inadequate showing at this tournament.         
	THE GUARDIAN: This was not the way it was meant to be. Set to make 154 to win and stay in the tournament, an India team who at no stage this past week or so have played with the verve of champions, batted dismally, fell behind the rate early on and were unable to play catch-up later. Perhaps the Indian Premier League has benefited the overseas players more than its own. Cancel it immediately.         
	THE INDEPENDENT: The holders are out, the hosts are still in... Improbably, nervously, deservedly... England blasted the Indians from the start. They bowled fast and straight and much of the time they aimed at the body. India had no answer. It would be gloating, of course, to ask why there has been all that fuss about the Indian Premier League and how it makes Twenty20 experts of all those who sail in her. The victory was achieved at the home of cricket yet England must have felt Sunday night as though they were playing in Mumbai or Delhi.         
	THE SUN: Collingwood and Co. were jeered as they finished a practice session before the game. They responded by sending India tumbling out of the World Twenty20. Taking their cue from the West Indies, who bombed India on Friday evening, England were hostile and liberal with their short stuff. The tactics showed Twenty20 matches are not all about containment. Unsettling opposition with bouncers can be an effective weapon. India were on the back foot immediately in their pursuit and never recovered.         
	THE TIMES: Aggressive bowling and disciplined fielding lay at the heart of (the) victory that broke the hearts of a billion Indians and silenced the large and passionate crowd of away supporters. Englands total had appeared fragile, particularly when Yuvraj Singh walked off the bench in the eleventh over, but Englands fast bowlers kept the game in the balance with accurate, short-pitched bowling.

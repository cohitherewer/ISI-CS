  - I-League Chirag miss chances galore vs Air India as match finishes 3-3         A STAFF REPORTER              Chirag United rsquo;s Joshimar leaps high to make it 3-3 against Air India during their I-League match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. After three matches Chirag are still unbeaten in the League. A Telegraph picture                            
	Calcutta: Chirag United had to be content with only one point against Air India in an I-League match they should have won comfortably at the Salt Lake Stadium Tuesday.         
	Jayanta Sen put the home team ahead in the 11th minute during a period when they had the visitors pinned down but Air India bounced back strongly to equalise through a brilliant Dada Nabeel header. M.D. Opara then struck in the 42nd and 47th minutes to give Air India an unexpected 3-1 lead.         
	When everything seemed lost, Gouranga Datta and Joshimar equalised in the last 25 minutes to maintain Chirag Uniteds unbeaten run in the league so far.         
	The 3-3 scoreline aptly summed up the thriller that only a few hundred were around to witness first hand.         
	Joshimar and Edmilson Marquess profligacy let Chirag down on at least three goals within the first 15 minutes besides an overruled penalty claim when the latter was tripped inside the penalty box.         
	Joshimar shot over from close in the very first minute and, three minutes later, Edmilsons shot hit the crossbar. In the ninth minute a superb Lalkamal Bhowmick freekick was saved by the goalkeeper.         
	Chirags attacks were increasing exponentially as the visitors struggled to find a toehold. After a series of misses by teammates, Jayanta finally shot home after Edmilson had failed to connect a Lalkamal cross from the left.         
	Jayanta and Shylo Malsawmtluanga were in complete control as Air India struggled to keep pace with the quick interchange of positions of the rival forwards. There was no let up in the Chirag offensive  Joshimar failed to beat Arnab Das Sharma from a one-on-one and Edmilson failed to nod into an open net in the 22nd minute.         
	It seemed Bimal Ghoshs men were staring at a whitewash. But Nabeel changed all that in the 25th minute. Soccor Velho outpaced a defender down the right and sent in what looked like a harmless cross. But Nabeel met it with a flying header from the edge of the box to leave Sandip Nandy stunned.         
	It is to be seen whether the 23-year-old Karnataka striker will make it big but he certainly showcased his talent on Tuesday.         
	The goal was completely against the run of play and changed the course of the match.         
	Chirag were suddenly looking disjointed as the players started taking things a little easy. Eduardo Chacon was also booked by the referee for unnecessarily contesting a decision.         
	Air India struck again before the breather.         
	Ravinder Singhs centre was coolly headed in by an unmarked M.D. Opara. Two minutes after halftime, Air India increased the lead when Opara once again got into the act. Uttam Singhs throw was headed in neatly in the nick of time.         
	Facing a two-goal deficit, Subrata Bhattacharya brought on Gouranga and P.C. Lalawmpuiya to add zeal to the attack. The move paid off as the attacks increased with the introduction of fresh pairs of legs.         
	Edmilson was denied by Arnab from a one-on-one situation and Gouranga was quick to capitalise as the loose ball fell to him. That the goalie was out of position only made his task a bit easier.         
	Nine minutes later came the equaliser. Manas Dass corner flew in and Safar Sardar was quick to head the ball towards the goal. Joshimar, standing almost on the goalline, only ensured the target wasnt missed.         
	In the dying minutes, Gouranga missed a sitter with the goalie at his mercy.

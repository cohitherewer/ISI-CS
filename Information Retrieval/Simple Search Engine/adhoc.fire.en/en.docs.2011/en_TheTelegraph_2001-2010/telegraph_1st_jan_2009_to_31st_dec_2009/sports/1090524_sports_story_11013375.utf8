                                                     Archers shine
            A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta: Five Indians made it to the medal round in the individual section of the second Asian Grand Prix archery tournament in Tehran on Friday. Three of them  Tarundeep Rai (mens recurve), L. Haridas Singh (mens compound) and Sweety Kumari (womens compound)  moved into the final while two  Muni Ram Tirkey (mens recurve) and Sushma (womens recurve)  reached the bronze medal playoff.         
	With scores of 109, 106 and 106 in the three rounds he has played so far, Rai, seeded second, would look to avenge compatriot Tirkeys semi-final defeat at the hands of fourth-seed Milad Vaziri Teymoorlooei when he takes on the Iranian for the gold medal. Milad had defeated top-seed Tirkey 109-106 in the semi-finals.         
	Sweety was the best among the four Indian women compound archers. She ensured a place in the final against second-seed Seyedeh Vida Halimian Avval of Iran. Singh will come up against Robert Bojti in the mens compound final.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I-League puts CFL in a spot
                                                   I-League puts CFL in a spot
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The schedule of the third edition of the I-League, released by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Friday, could completely jeopardise the Calcutta Football League (CFL) this season.         
	The AIFF, which had earlier agreed to play the I-League only on weekends, and wanted the Indian Football Association (IFA) to hold the CFL simultaneously on weekdays, has now gone back on its words, scheduling I-League matches on all days of the week.         
	According to sources, in the I-League meeting held here on Friday, the secretaries of the IFA and the Goa Football Association (GFA) raised this point and asked the AIFF general secretary, Alberto Colaco, to find a solution.         
	The AIFF secretary suggested the local leagues in Calcutta and Goa should be played in December and February when the I-League will be stopped temporarily for the SAFF Cup, the Federation Cup and the AFC Challenge Cup, said a member, who was present in the meeting.         
	The suggestion is not only impractical but also highly unfair to the non-I-League teams in both the states, said another member.         
	He feared that the AIFF move will not only put the Calcutta league in danger but will also hamper IFAs relationship with their broadcasting partners.         
	The IFA secretary, Utpal Ganguli, requested the committee to include the Mohun Bagan ground as an I-League venue, but the proposal was rejected because of stiff opposition from Colaco.         
	The Calcutta giants  Mohun Bagan and East Bengal  will have their first meeting in the I-League on October 25. The league starts on October 1.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Federer, Nadal clash on the cards
                                                   Federer, Nadal clash on the cards
                            
	Los Angeles: Roger Federer may get the chance for revenge against Rafael Nadal at the Indian Wells ATP tournament starting this week, his first event since losing last months Australian Open final to the Spaniard.         
	Federers dreams of a record-equalling 14th Grand Slam singles crown were shattered when he was beaten by left-hander Nadal in a five-set thriller at Melbourne Park. The 27-year-old Swiss, a triple champion at Indian Wells, has been sidelined since then while trying to shake off a back injury.         
	After injuring my back last autumn I did not have enough time to strengthen it completely, he said on his website after pulling out of the Dubai Championships and last weeks Davis Cup tie against the United States.         
	As a precautionary measure I will use the next few weeks to make sure the back injury is fully rehabilitated and I am ready for the rest of the 2009 season.         
	The imposing, state-of-the-art Indian Wells Tennis Garden is an ideal venue for Federer to kickstart his campaign, the Swiss having posted a hattrick of titles there from 2004. This tournament has worked out well for me, winning three titles a row and playing some of my best tennis here, the world No. 2 said.         
	Ive had some great finals, big matches, and I always enjoy playing at Indian Wells. The surface really suits my game, my slice stays low, the kick goes up and the ball travels quickly through the air.         
	Should Federer meet 2007 champion Nadal in the opening Masters Series event of the season he will come up against a player fresh from a commanding victory over Serbias Novak Djokovic at the weekend.         
	Djokovic, who claimed last years title at Indian Wells, was pummelled 6-4, 6-4, 6-1 by world No. 1 Nadal on the clay of Benidorm on Sunday when Spain booked their place in the Davis Cup quarter finals. Federers other main rivals in the mens event, which starts on Thursday, include holder Djokovic and British world No. 4 Andy Murray, who beat the Swiss in the semi finals of the Qatar Open in January. Among the leading contenders in the womens competition, starting on Wednesday, are holder Ana Ivanovic, fellow Serb and world No. 3 Jelena Jankovic and second-ranked Russian Dinara Safina.         
	Maria Sharapova will begin her long-awaited comeback from a shoulder injury in the womens doubles at Indian Wells where she will team up with compatriot Elena Vesnina.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Finishing a worry for Mahindra 
                                                   Finishing a worry for Mahindra 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mahindra United will look to overcome their finishing worries when they take on JCT in a 15th round I-League match here Saturday.         
	Both teams are on 16 points each but the hosts are just ahead by virtue of goal difference and Derrick Pereiras team would look to pull away by earning maximum points from the encounter at the Cooperage.         
	We have been playing well but not scoring. Our finishing has been poor and not consistent. We need to improve our scoring rate, we badly need some points on the table, Pereira said on the eve of the match. Mahindra, however, would be without defender Lamine Tamba (double booking), and midfielder Arata Izumi is also out with an injury.         
	Mahindra failed to break the jinx against Mumbai FC last week and featured in a 0-0 draw in the local derby. But JCT fared worse after a 2-0 loss to Mohammedan Sporting in an away game.         
	JCT would also field an under-strength team as they will miss the services of three defenders  Jaspal Singh, Baljeet Singh and Nigerian Julius Irabor Akpele while Gurvinder Singh is a doubtful starter.         
	No wonder then that coach Sukhwinder Singh was a worried man ahead of the match.         
	Both the teams are on same points and therefore both would be desperate for a win. It will all boil down to who handles the nerves better, Sukhvinder said. But with such a depleted side at his disposal, the visiting coach would be happy to go back with a point in their kitty.         
	 Pereiras concerns about finishing pales in comparison then. Mahindra seemed to have rediscovered their goal-scoring touch in the Federation Cup and extended that form when the I-League resumed.         
	But the goalless tie in the local derby seemed to mark the return of the drought, as well as creases on Pereiras forehead.

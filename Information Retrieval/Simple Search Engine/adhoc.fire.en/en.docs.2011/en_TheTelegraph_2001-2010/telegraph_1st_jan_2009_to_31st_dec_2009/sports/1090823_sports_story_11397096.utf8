The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | World is going nuts over Bolt
                                                     World is going nuts over Bolt
    - Cricket could have never given the jamaican the platform he relishes             JIM WHITE             Usain Bolt                                 
	It was quite some birthday Usain Bolt celebrated Friday. As he toasted himself with a fruit juice and high-energy, high-carbohydrate breakfast in his Berlin hotel room, he would have seen that he has been credited with all sorts of superlatives.         
	According to the headlines generated round the globe this week by his world record-breaking sprinting, he is the man who not only single-handedly revived the ailing, compromised, dispirited sport but he also transformed his tiny island nation of Jamaica into a sprinting superpower, the epicentre of fast, smashing in the process 50 years of unbroken American hegemony.         
	Which is some feat for the 23-year- old from the village of Trelawny on the islands north coast, a young man who, away from the track, appears to view the world with all the languid demeanour of the terminal Generation X slacker.         
	But then appearances can be deceptive. He might walk with a roll, he might talk with a drawl, but there is nothing remotely slack about Usain Bolts achievements this week. The Russian pole-vaulter Sergei Bubka used to spend his summers slyly breaking his own world record by a millimetre at a time. It was a clever financial strategy, since every time he raised the bar he earned himself a few thousand dollars in prize money put up by credulous sponsors.         
	Bolt doesnt behave like that. When he breaks a world record  invariably his own  he doesnt do it by carefully modulated increments. He smashes it into little pieces, grinds it into the dust, hurls it to the floor with a magnificent flourish.         
	It is not merely that no one has ever run this quickly before. It is not solely that no one has ever come close to touching Bolts speed of 28mph, a pace quick enough to keep a step ahead of a cheetah in full flow. It was the manner of his performance that generated such awe-struck silence, the way that as he eased round the track: he gave every impression that he was keeping something back for next time. Even as they watched him go faster than anyone has before, everyone there knew that it is only a matter of time before he goes even faster.         
	The thing about sprinting is that it is the most pure sporting pursuit ever invented. It is all about executing that most fundamental of human dynamics: running as fast as you can. There is no ball, no net, no hoop. There is no tackling, no time-wasting, no scrum, ruck or maul. It is simply a matter of getting from point A to point B quicker than anyone else. And there is nothing purer than that.         
	Or at least it used to be pure, before the chemists defiled it. For some, when they watch Bolt belting home so far ahead of his rivals they need binoculars to catch a glimpse of his disappearing back, it is impossible not to be reminded of previous occasions when a sprinter has won on the big stage by a mile. Ben Johnson, Florence Griffith-Joyner, Marion Jones: these are the performers who previously destroyed the field, leaving it bedraggled in their wash. And subsequently each of them has been found to be fuelled by illegally applied chemicals. It seemed, watching them compromise their sport, that triumph could only be achieved through cheating. The British sprinter Dwain Chambers, himself once a cocktail of illegality, said before last years Olympics that gold could not be achieved without help. Substantial help.         
	Then along came Bolt. His was no sudden emergence from nowhere. Those who know about sprinting had known about him for ages. When he won the Caribbean schools competition as a lanky 14-year-old, hammering boys four years his senior in the process, the watching Don Quarry, the Jamaican sprinter who won gold at the 1976 Olympics, said he had never seen anything like it. Even then the great Jamaican predicted this boy would transform his sport, this was raw natural talent the like of which he had never seen before. By the time he arrived at the Olympics last year, Bolt was sprintings worst-kept secret, a time bomb waiting for the right platform on which to explode.         
	Of course, as he announced himself to the world in the Birds Nest stadium in Beijing last August, up in the press seats there were those who viewed his triumphs with scepticism. And there were those  particularly among the Americans  who muttered darkly about the manner in which Jamaica had absented itself from the rigorously applied drug-testing regulations. The facts suggest this is mere sophistry: Bolt has been tested to distraction and come up clean every time.         
	Besides, examined more closely, the visual evidence insists there is nothing unnatural about his style. He has none of the square-jawed, bloated-thighed look of the steroid-fuelled. He merely seems more naturally blessed than anyone before, not least in the fact that half his six foot five inches appears to be made up by his legs. Bolt himself says that his success is entirely in his family line, a result of the genetic survival of the fittest that was the slave trade, the deadly race of strength and power that thrust his ancestors on to Jamaica 400 years ago, tasked with working the cane fields until they dropped.         
	The purity of Bolts performances has had startling knock-on effects. He is easily the biggest storm to emerge from the Caribbean since Hurricane Georges, the most substantial international star Jamaica has seen since Bob Marley. Across the whole region, suddenly everyone wants to be a runner. Where once the beaches were filled with pick-up games of cricket, now they are awash with impromptu sprint challenges. As the cricketer Desmond Haynes wryly put it this week, imagine what Bolt would do to cricket if he had chosen to use his pace as a fast bowler.         
	But then cricket could never have given Bolt the platform that he enjoyed this week. And how he enjoyed it. Cheery, amused, unfazed, most of all what the young Jamaican possesses is a natural sense of theatre.

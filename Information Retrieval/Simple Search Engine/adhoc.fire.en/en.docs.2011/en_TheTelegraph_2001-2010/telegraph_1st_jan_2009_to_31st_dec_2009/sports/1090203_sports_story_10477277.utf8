                                                   Yuki sets sight on India cap
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Yuki Bhambri, the first Indian to win the Australian Open junior title, has now set his sights on earning a Davis Cup cap.         
	Bhambri returned to the city on Monday. The Delhi boy was received by his parents, officials of the All India Tennis Association (AITA) and trainees of the Mahesh Bhupathi Team Tennis (MBTT).         
	Bhambri said that he was confident of doing well in Melbourne as he had been in good form for the past couple of months. Playing in the senior circuit before going to Australia helped me a lot, the youngster said. I was sure that practice would help.         
	Its only a beginning for me. The real challenge will be there in coming years, he said.         
	Yuki has set his sights on playing for India in the Davis Cup. Every player who picks up the racquet dreams of becoming a part of the Indian team. I am no different. Definitely I want to wear that shirt with India written on the back, Yuki said.         
	I dont know when that time will come. Perhaps it will take one or one-and-a-half years.

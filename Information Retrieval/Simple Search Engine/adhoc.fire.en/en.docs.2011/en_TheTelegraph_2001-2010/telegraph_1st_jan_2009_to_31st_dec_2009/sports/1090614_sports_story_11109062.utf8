The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Having our backs to the wall brings best out of us: Dhoni
                                                   Having our backs to the wall brings best out of us: Dhoni
    - We arent the best fielding side, admits Team India captain           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  
	London: Fidel Edwards and Jerome Taylor were fast and furious  reminding Sunil Gavaskar of the West Indies attack from the mid-Seventies to the mid-Eighties  and, then, Dwayne Bravo made an impact with the ball too.         
	At the end of it all, at Lords on Friday night, defending champions India were big losers (seven wickets) in their opening World T20 Super Eight engagement.         
	Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni didnt offer excuses, though, at his post-match session with the media.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Reflections on the match         
	You could consider it an off day... However, we fought and took it till the second-last over... We have our backs to the wall, but we do well in such situations... Having our backs to the wall brings the best out of us.         
	Whether 153 for seven was enough         
	It wasnt... Wasnt a par score... We needed 165-170... Still, wed fancied our chance, especially after containing the West Indies in the first six overs... We also contained (Chris) Gayle.         
	Yuvraj Singhs superb 67 (off 43 balls)         
	Thanks to him we got to the total we reached...         
	Change in batting order, specifically dropping himself to No.5         
	Thats because, unlike the earlier matches, we lost the first wicket quickly... Thats why (Suresh) Raina went at No.3... He would have in the earlier matches too, had we lost the first wicket early... Sometimes changes work, sometimes they dont... Raina had an off day.         
	Batsmen not having scored from as many as 51 balls         
	Well be looking at the dot balls... If wed kept them down to 35-40 then at least 11 runs would have been added... In analysing the match, the dot balls will be taken into account.         
	Strike not being rotated         
	We didnt, in the middle overs... Hopefully, we wont make the same mistake in the next match (against England, on Sunday).         
	[Dhoni himself failed to rotate the strike, using 23 balls for just 11, one of the slowest T20 innings if the calculation is 10 or more runs.]         
	West Indies aggressive bowling         
	The wicket had bounce and they made use of it... Yes, they were aggressive.         
	The fielding         
	We arent the best fielding side (in the tournament) and cant become one (overnight)... But, if you look at our XI, its the best fielding unit... The West Indies took some brilliant catches...         
	Whether optional training sessions have blunted the sharpness on the field         
	Look, one more day of fielding cant make a difference... Dont think optional nets matters.         
	Having come through the Super Eight via an easy group, while the West Indies were in the toughest one         
	But we didnt take any match lightly...         
	Finally, Bravos knock         
	He batted brilliantly.

                                                   Pension hike on the cards
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: There is good news for sportspersons of yesteryears. The government is planning a huge hike in pensions for all former international medal winners.         
	The sports minister, M.S. Gill, who assumed charge on Friday, said he has a plan to increase the pensions to between Rs 20,000 to Rs 30,000. As per the current schemes, the pensions vary between Rs 3,000-8,000.         
	Before I assumed office, the former sportspersons were receiving only half of what they are getting now, Gill said. I want to make the living of former players more comfortable and increase the pensions to between Rs 20,000-30,000. For that, I certainly need to take the matter to the finance ministry.         
	The ministry of sports has also decided to request the government to consider its suggestions before honouring sportspersons with Padma awards.         
	Henceforth, we will request the home ministry to allow us to offer our suggestions on sportspersons who are selected for the Padma awards, Gill said.         
	The ministry is also likely to redesign all trophies that are awarded to Arjuna, Khel Ratna and Dronacharya awardees. All the awardees have to be present in person to accept the awards.         
	The stage is also set for the formation of a new body, Hockey India, before the World Cup to be held in the capital in March. The International Hockey Federation (FIH) has already threatened to shift the meet to Malaysia unless a united federation (men and women) replaces the present ad hoc committee.         
	Gill assured that he was in talks with the IOA and that the new federation would be put in place very soon.

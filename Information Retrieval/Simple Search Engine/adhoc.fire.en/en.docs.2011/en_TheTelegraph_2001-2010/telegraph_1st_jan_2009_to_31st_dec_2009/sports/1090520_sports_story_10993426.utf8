	Johannesburg: Jacques Kallis delivered when it mattered most as the South African batsman cracked an unbeaten half-century to guide the Royal Challengers Bangalore to a thumping seven-wicket victory over the Delhi DareDevils at the Wanderers on Tuesday. The victory kept their semi-final hopes alive in the Indian Premier League.         
	Kallis (58 not out) carried his bat through the innings hitting two fours and two sixes from 56 balls to steer the Royal Challengers Bangalore to their seventh win from 13 matches after the DareDevils elected to bat and posted 134 for seven.         
	Kallis shared a 70-run stand from 69 balls for the second wicket with Rahul Dravid (34-ball 38), and then combined with Ross Taylor (12-ball 25) for 29 runs from just 14 balls for the third wicket to take the Royal Challengers Bangalore home with one over to spare.         
	The Royal Challengers Bangalore, now at fourth place in the IPL table with 14 points, will though need to win their last match against the Deccan Chargers in Centurion on Thursday to make sure that they make it to the last-four stage.         
	Chasing 135 for a win on a slow pitch, the Royal Challengers Bangalore batsmen, except for Taylor, grafted for runs for most part of the match.         
	Robin Uthappa (1) continued his poor form but Kallis and Dravid stabilised the Bangalore innings.         
	The two experienced duo shunned extravagance and runs came in singles with boundaries few and far between though Kallis lifted an Avishkar Salvi delivery for a huge six in the fourth over.         
	From 19 for one at the end of fifth over, Kallis and Dravid took Bangalore to 54 for one at the strategy break before the former India captain fell, caught and bowled by debutant Yogesh Nagar.         
	In-form Taylor punished Salvi for a four and a six off consecutive balls to show his aggressive intent while Kallis dropped anchor only to open up towards the close.         
	Next over, Taylor eased the pressure further by smashing two sixes off the first two balls of Yogesh but he paid the price of being too adventurous.         
	The New Zealander, whose cameo brought down the asking rate, tried another six off the third ball of Yogesh to hole out to Daniel Vettori near the boundary.         
	The Royal Challengers Bangalore needed 33 from the last five overs, but they finished off the match with a four.For the DareDevils, Yogesh Nagar returned with two for 20 while Ashish Nehra took one wicket.         
	Earlier, the Royal Challengers bowlers were spot on in their line and length and fielders backed them with some good work to restrict the DareDevils to 134 for seven.         
	Dinesh Karthik top-scored with a 29-ball 31 while AB de Villiers and Gautam Gambhir contributed 28 and 27, respectively.

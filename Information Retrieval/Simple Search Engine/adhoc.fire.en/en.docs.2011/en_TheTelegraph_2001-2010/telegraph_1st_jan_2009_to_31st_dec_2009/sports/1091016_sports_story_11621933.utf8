The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Prasad, Robin sacked
                                                     Prasad, Robin sacked
            OUR BUREAU    
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Thursday sacked Venkatesh Prasad and Robin Singh as bowling and fielding coach, respectively. However, no reason was cited for their sacking.         
	The BCCI has decided to discontinue the services of bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad and fielding coach Robin Singh with immediate effect, said a brief statement from BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan.         
	The move has taken everyone by surprise since both had been around since the tour of Bangladesh just after the disastrous 2007 World Cup campaign. They were, however, working without formal contracts.         
	It couldnt be confirmed but theres also talk that Prasad and Robin demanded a better remuneration, and because of the recent performances, the BCCI thought it was unjustified.         
	They were informed of their sacking through email.         
	On the face of it, it appears that both have paid for the continuing dismal standard of fielding and a complete lack of sting in bowling, aspects which were prominently on view during the recently-concluded Champions Trophy.         
	There hasnt been much improvement in Indias fielding standards over the last two years, and there have been some embarrassing moments in the past few months. That makes it a concern for a team aspiring to be the best in the world.         
	The Indian bowlers performance has also been under the scanner, especially after the teams dismal performance in the World T20 and Champions Trophy. Ishant Sharma and Rudra Pratap Singh have struggled and the latter has been dropped from the ODI squad for the first two matches of the seven-match series against Australia. Even a proven match-winner like off-spinner Harbhajan Singh has struggled in the Champions Trophy.         
	Ishants decline has been most astonishing. From being one of the most exciting fast bowlers in 2008, he has slipped to a point where he is being considered lucky to still be in the team. Indeed the fast bowlers, with their additional baggage of poor fielding and fitness, have been Indias main worry in the limited overs game.         
	The apparent paucity of fast-bowling reserves has also to do with the recurring injuries to the fast bowlers too.         
	At the same time, there is talk that the BCCI is actually not happy with the Team India support staff having a role to play in the Indian Premier League. That though doesnt seem to be a convincing argument but the fact remains that Robin has just signed as the Mumbai Indians coach while Prasad is associated with the Chennai Super Kings.         
	To confuse matters, Srinivasan is also the Chennai Super Kings supremo!

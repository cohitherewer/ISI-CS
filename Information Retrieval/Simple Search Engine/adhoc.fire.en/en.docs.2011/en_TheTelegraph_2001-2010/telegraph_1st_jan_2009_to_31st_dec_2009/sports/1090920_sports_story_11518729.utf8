The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barreto is the key
                                                     Barreto is the key
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Barreto                           
	New Delhi: It could be a battle between foreign imports and local talent, when Mohun Bagan take on Mahindra United in the Durand Cup semi-final here Sunday.         
	Eager to end their eight-year title drought in the capital, the Calcutta team have played impressively in the league stage, mainly because of their two foreign recruits. The performances of Jose Barreto and Edeh Chidi have overshadowed the loopholes that were there in the Bagan ranks in the last two matches.         
	Mahindra, on the other hand, have made the last four from the toughest group. The Mumbai outfit were disappointing against Lajong FC, but combined well when it mattered most, against East Bengal.         
	It was heartening to see Mahindras home grown players like Steven Dias and Mohammed Rafi do well under pressure. Proficient as a wing-half, the Kerala boy has the potential to don national colours.         
	But then, the presence of Barreto could be too overwhelming. The evergreen Brazilian burst onto the Indian football scene in the 1999-2000 season, and helped Mohun Bagan win the National Football League (NFL) twice before moving to Malaysia to play club football.         
	He returned to India in 2005 to play for Mahindra. Even today, Barreto, who on Friday, became only the second foreigner after Chima Okerie to score 200 goals in the competitive football for Indian clubs, stands a cut above the rest.         
	The game of football is won and lost mainly on four things, said Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencherifa. They are quality of football, fitness, game plan and team spirit. We have all four in right place, and should be able to win the cup here.         
	Karim was not far from the truth, but his midfield could prove to be the Achilles heel. It looked rudderless against JCT.         
	Thankfully, the Mohun Bagan defence, including the goalie, played flawlessly to thwart a barrage of attacks by JCT forwards. It may need to do an encore against Mahindra United to support the good work of the Barreto-Chidi combination.         
	Churchill in final         
	Churchill Brothers continued their golden run when they defeated Dempo Sports Club 2-1 to reach the Durand Cup final on Saturday.         
	The I-League champions struck their first goal through Charan Rai in the 21st minute and then consolidated the lead in the 50th minute through Okolie Odafe. Dempo reduced the margin through Beto in the 83rd minute.

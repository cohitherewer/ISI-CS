The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A moment to rejoice, but with maturity
                                                                                                                       7                                      A moment to rejoice, but with maturity
            Guest Column - Arun Lal                             
	Indias No.1 ranking in Tests is a culmination of great cricket played over the last 4/5 years. Remember this doesnt happen overnight!         
	Cheers to all the players, captains, coaches, the Board of Control for Cricket in India, the selectors and, not to forget, the fans who have supported the side through thick and thin.         
	Its time to rejoice, no doubt, but with maturity. We shouldnt go overboard, and the euphoria needs to be tempered with the thought that its only the beginning of an era.         
	Rankings on their own are not absolute, but broad indicators of consistency. We can rejoice as a nation at a challenge aced, but greater ones lie ahead.         
	Every Indian will be proud of the team and its achievements, but rankings apart, Im not sure if we are the undisputed No. 1 side.         
	We need to beat South Africa and Australia on their home turf to convince all about our new-found status.         
	I do realise you can only play the field you are given, but it would have been terrific if a tour was scheduled to either South Africa or Australia at a time when we are playing at our best. Im sure the thought must be going through the minds of the players, too.         
	We have had a fantastic couple of years and our batting seems to have no rival at the moment.         
	However, to win not only Tests but also series abroad, we need to improve on our fielding.         
	We still need a quality bowling all-rounder and a match winning fast bowler, in the mould of Ishant Sharma. That is one area that needs to be explored.         
	While I compliment the selectors for the reintroduction of Sreesanth, the greatest challenge facing them is the need to infuse new blood.         
	For a team to dominate, we need to have reserve strength. An area that needs to be worked upon!         
	A team, to stay ahead, needs to evolve continuously and there is no team which is absolutely perfect.         
	For instance, in this process of evolution, we have seen Gautam Gambhir excel, but Murali Vijay, too, has shown the temperament and ability to deal with pressure.         
	May be it is time to see how the Suresh Rainas, Rohit Sharmas, Cheteshwar Pujaras, R. Ashwins, Sudeep Tyagis and Ajinkya Rahanes respond to the challenges!         
	The coming series versus Bangladesh provides us with an opportunity to test these youngsters.         
	Im not talking of en masse replacements, but certainly with discretion. May be a Sachin Tendulkar, VVS Laxman, Zaheer Khan or Harbhajan Singh can be rested!         
	The intent is to ensure that you have a bench strength that leaves you prepared for any eventuality.         
	I am rather optimistic about the future as long as we continue to evolve because seldom have we seen such camaraderie and spirit in a side. We have got to laud all concerned, especially the captain and the coach.         
	The Gary Kirsten-Mahendra Singh Dhoni combine has worked wonders along with the support of champions like Sachin and Rahul Dravid.         
	The contributions of former captains Sourav Ganguly, Dravid and Anil Kumble also need to be highlighted in this context.         
	What stands out for this team, apart from its tremendous balance, is their belief, aggression, will to win, and above all, a fearless attitude, epitomised by the likes of Sehwag. A combination of all this makes the unit unbeatable.         
	I am sure I speak for the entire nation in saluting this fantastic achievement.

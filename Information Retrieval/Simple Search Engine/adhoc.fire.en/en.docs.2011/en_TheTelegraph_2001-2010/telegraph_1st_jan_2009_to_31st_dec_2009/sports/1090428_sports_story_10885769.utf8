The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aakash Chopra was to leave after camp
                                                     Aakash Chopra was to leave after camp
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Aakash Chopra                           
	Port Elizabeth: Aakash Chopra, one of the two (other being Sanjay Bangar) sent home by the Kolkata Knight Riders management, after the fourth match, had actually been booked to depart at the end of the conditioning camp in Bloemfontein.         
	Chopras ticket was done, but he stayed back (till Saturday) because of the injury to Cheteshwar Pujara... He knew that well, a member of the team management told The Telegraph.         
	While Chopra had probably seen the writing on the wall, after failing in the first two matches, Bangar is understood to have expressed unhappiness at being packed off after just one opportunity (in the thriller against the Rajasthan Royals).         
	John Buchanan, who heads the franchises cricket operations, took the decision to send both home.         
	Some may find it odd, but if Sourav Ganguly could be sacked as captain two days before the Knights first match in the ongoing edition, then the franchise is capable of doing anything.         
	Significantly, nobody said a word then.         
	Whats also a fact is that Chopra and Bangar are ill-suited for T20 cricket and shouldnt have been given contracts. On that front, certainly, Buchanan erred.

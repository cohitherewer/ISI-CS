            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Wasim Akram (left) and Sanjay Manjrekar at a promotional in New Delhi on Tuesday. (AP)                                 
	New Delhi: Former Test star Sanjay Manjrekar is not ready to bet his money on India in the upcoming World T20 despite saying Mahendra Singh Dhonis side are the strongest on paper.         
	Talking to reporters Tuesday during the unveiling of the T20 World Cup trophy here, Manjrekar said India were a better side than the one that won the inaugural tournament in South Africa two years ago.         
	Dhoni has the best and the most experienced side with him, said Manjrekar. Two years ago they were the reluctant participants. Now the story is different. Even youngsters like Suresh Raina and Rohit Sharma are more experienced.         
	Manjrekar, however, wasnt sure whether India would retain the title. This format of the game is very unpredictable. I am not ready to bet my money on any team.         
	Gautam Gambhirs poor form, according to Manjrekar, is a matter of minor concern. During the IPL, I thought Gambhir was low on confidence. I did not like his body language. But then, its a minor issue.         
	As far as pressure is concerned, I think we are used to it and its Dhonis second nature to go out with the burden of expectation on his shoulder.         
	Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram, who was present on the occasion, said he was afraid that Dhonis men could be a tired lot during the T20 World Cup.         
	India are a strong team but mental fatigue can set in, commented Akram. They have been playing continuously for two years. The boys may be tired.         
	Akram, who felt Pakistan had a fair chance of winning the title this time, however, admitted that as a team, India are much stronger now.         
	India could be like Australia. Their back up is good. India are not dependent on one or two players for success.         
	During our days, we knew that dismissing Sachin (Tendulkar) was enough to get an upper hand. The situation has changed. Now, even if you get (Virender) Sehwag cheaply, India have the required strength to make a comeback, Akram said.         
	Akram and Manjrekar were of the opinion that spinners are likely to play vital roles during the middle overs in the T20 World Cup saying the conditions in England may also help the spinners.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | For a change, Knights win off the last ball
                                                   For a change, Knights win off the last ball
  - McCullums 81 and Hodges unbeaten 71 script second victory for Shah Rukhs boys       A CORRESPONDENT                            
	The Kolkata Knight Riders finally managed to turn a last-ball finish in their favour in the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Monday when they beat the Chennai Super Kings by seven wickets at the SuperSport Park, Centurion.         
	Requiring one to win off the last delivery, Wriddhiman Saha did the needful with a lofted drive off Suresh Raina to win the second match for the Knight Riders in the T20 leagues second edition.         
	Brendon McCullums boys had lost both their last-ball finishes earlier in the tournament  against the Kings XI Punjab and the Deccan Chargers. But Wriddhiman (unbeaten 25 off 13 balls) ensured his team were at least third time lucky.         
	The Knight Riders presented a thoroughly professional batting display to chase down the Super Kings mammoth total of 188 for three. They kept close to the required run-rate throughout their chase and were never really out of the match. It was only after David Husseys (3) run-out that the target looked a bit difficult for Shah Rukh Khans boys.         
	If captain McCullum showed the way with a scintillating 81 off 48 balls, it was Brad Hodges priceless 71 not out (off 44 balls) that sealed the match for the Knight Riders.         
	Hodge and Wriddhimans unbeaten 56-run partnership for the fourth wicket ensured there were no slip-ups this time. The feature of Hodges knock was his measured aggression. He hit four sixes and an identical number of boundaries and took risks exactly when he needed to. His assault on Laxmipathy Balaji in the 19th over, when the medium-pacer was hit for 19 runs, put the match in the Knight Riders grip.         
	Skipper McCullum was at his sublime best on Monday. He tore into Sudeep Tyagis third over, the sixth of the innings and the last of the Powerplay, and blasted him for 22 runs. After defending the medium-pacers first ball, the New Zealander hit four consecutive boundaries and a six off the next five deliveries to bring up his half-century in only 21 deliveries.         
	He peppered the off and on-side boundaries at will to keep his team in the hunt. He was out bowled, trying to hit left-arm spinner Shadab Jakati out of the ground. The ball just kissed the off-stump on its way to Dhonis gloves and the New Zealand vice-captain was ruled out by the third umpire after looking at the replays.         
	Sourav Ganguly (four off 14 balls) looked completely out of touch during his stay at the crease. He tried to hit his way out but failed to connect any. After surviving two run-out opportunities, his misery finally came to an end when he chopped down one from Muttiah Muralidharan onto his leg stump. The Sri Lankan off-spinner bowled brilliantly, giving away only 16 runs in his four overs.         
	The Super Kings rested Matthew Hayden for Mondays match due to a niggling injury in his thigh. Australian George Bailey was drafted in as a replacement.         
	 McCullum had to turn to his spinners very early on in the innings after the poor show by his pacers. But the spinners too failed to make an impact as Suresh Raina (52 off 36 balls) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (unbeaten 40 off 28 balls) helped the Super Kings amass 188 for three.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indian men move up; Sania loses
                                                   Indian men move up; Sania loses
                      
	New York: Fourth seeds Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy moved into the third round of the US Open on Saturday. The Indo-Czech pair defeated Nicolas Almagro and Ruben Ramirez Hidalgo of Spain 6-2, 6-3.         
	On Friday, Sania Mirza crashed out the womens doubles after losing a thriller, but Mahesh Bhupathi and his partner advanced to the second round of mixed doubles.         
	Fourteenth seeds Sania and Francesca Schiavone of Italy made a smart recovery from a set down, but failed to deliver at crucial points in the decider to lose 2-6, 6-1, 5-7 against the unseeded duo of Gisela Dulko of Argentina and Shahar Peer of Israel in a 125-minute second-round match.         
	The opening set saw Dulko and Peer having the upper hand in service by firing three aces, while Sania and Schiavone struggled with their serves as they dropped two of them to give away the first set 2-6 in 27 minutes. The Indo-Italian pair staged a fine recovery in the second set as they improved on their service and engaged their rivals in long rallies, which they won most of the time. Sania and Schiavone broke Dulko and Peer twice in the second set while giving them no chance to do the same.         
	Both the pairs reserved their best for the decider, which lasted 68 minutes. Sania and Schiavone smashed three aces but they still failed to win crucial points.         
	With most of the games being stretched to deuces, lots of break points were on offer and Dulko and Peer converted more of them than their Indo-American opponents. Dulko and Peer converted two of the nine break points, while Sania and Schiavone won one of the seven that came their way.         
	Sania, who could not advance beyond second round in singles, is still in the fray in mixed doubles. She and Canadian Daniel Nestor will take on the American duo of Carly Gullickson and Travis Parrott.         
	Meanwhile, top seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and his American partner Leizel Huber scored a straight-set victory over the unseeded pair of Marcelo Melo of Brazil and American Vania King in the mixed doubles opening round.         
	The Indo-American duo made a sluggish start, and were stretched a bit in the first set but they stamped their authority in the second set to win the match 7-5, 6-0 in 62 minutes.         
	Bhupathi and Huber were rusty in their first match of the Grand Slam event as they committed four double faults and nine unforced errors in the opening set. They, however, hit more winners than their opponents to win the first set 7-5 in 44 minutes.

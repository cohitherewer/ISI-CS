The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England stars get 3-week window
                                                   England stars get 3-week window
                      
	London: England and Wales Cricket Board Thursday agreed to release Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff for three weeks to play in the Indian Premier League, prompting the cricketers to sign the central contracts, due since last September.         
	They have been signed by the players and we are waiting on the IPL to come back with confirmation, England allrounder Paul Collingwood was quoted as saying.         
	However, IPL commissioner Lalit Modi had wanted at least a four week commitment from the English cricketers to let them play in the second edition of the tournament. If IPL agrees, up to six England players could be involved in the February 6 IPL auction with Pietersen and Flintoff expected to fetch lucrative contracts.         
	England players participation in the IPL had run into trouble after Modi had demanded a one-month window, while the ECB had initially granted only two weeks.         
	However, discussion between ECB and Professional Cricketers Association saw the window extended to three weeks. Those selected in Englands squad for the first Test against the West Indies at Lords starting May 6 will now be allowed to play in the IPL for up to 21 days.         
	Any England players signed for the IPL but deemed unlikely to make the Test squad would be available for up to 28 days. (PTI)

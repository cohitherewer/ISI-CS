The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | In-form City face   Arsenal assault
                                                   In-form City face   Arsenal assault
                            
	London: Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez is insistent that his team can still win the Premier League title despite losing as many games in the first month of the current campaign as they did all of last season.         
	Liverpool host Burnley on Saturday and are desperate to avoid the sort of shock result that Manchester United was dealt when they played the newly promoted side.         
	Burnley beat United 1-0 last month, but while the defending champions have rebounded with two wins, including a 2-1 victory over Arsenal, some of Liverpools players have shown little sign they are over their shaky start to the season.         
	Although Liverpool followed their opening 2-1 loss at Tottenham with a comfortable 4-0 win over Stoke, they then lost to visiting Aston Villa 3-1 and had to rally from 2-1 down to beat Bolton 3-2.         
	Captain Steven Gerrard at least looks to be returning to form after hitting the winner at Bolton and scoring twice in Englands 5-1 win over Croatia on Wednesday.         
	Liverpool are seventh in the standings with six points from four matches, the same as Burnley.         
	With Burnley captain Steve Caldwell out injured, Carlisle is set to continue in central defence alongside Andre Bikey.         
	Victory for either Liverpool or Burnley could take them level with United if the champions stumble at Tottenham on Saturday.         
	With injured Luka Modric out for about six weeks, Tottenham is likely to give Niko Kranjcar his debut.         
	Also Saturday, fourth-place Manchester City host sixth-place Arsenal, who are aiming to recover from their first loss of the season, while City is protecting a record of three straight wins.         
	Carlos Tevez is out of the match against Arsenal after tweaking his knee during World Cup duty with Argentina. They will also be without midfielder Andrey Arshavin (groin) but captain Cesc Fabregas is expected to return from a hamstring problem.         
	Winger Tomas Rosicky may still be short of full match fitness. Theo Walcott (back) has returned to training, while defender Johan Djourou (knee), winger Samir Nasri (broken leg) and reserve goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski (knee) are all out.           (AGENCIES)

     RAVI SHASTRI              
	What sort of field plan should be implemented during the slog overs?  
	(Ankit Pattnaik, 17, Rourkela)              
	It all depends on your strategy and the length and line youre looking to bowl.                 
	I am a middle-order batsman. I am not too comfortable against pacers. Should I practice on concrete wickets to improve my abilities?  
	(Sushanta Saha, 19, Calcutta)              
	Improving your play off the backfoot will definitely help.                 
	I am an off-spinner. How do I bowl on unresponsive pitches?   
	(Sougata Sur, 21, Calcutta)              
	Stick to a good line and be patient.                 
	I have represented my state and university teams in the past. Now I only play office cricket. The problem is body weight has increased over the years and thats affecting my footwork. Please help.  
	(Amarendra Jha, 34)              
	You will have to do some cardio to get lighter and thereby move more freely.                 
	I am a medium pacer. How close should one come to the stumps when bowling an outswinger?  
	(Prabir Gupta, 21, Calcutta)              
	Close enough not to disrupt the stumps.                 
	I am a right-handed batsman. How can I maintain my concentration at the start of every session?  
	(S. Dhar, 25, Calcutta)              
	Be selective in your shot making and tell yourself youve got to start all over again.                 
	I am a left-arm spinner. Should I bowl round the wicket when there are a few spots on the wicket.  
	(Rajdip Chowdhury, 21, Agartala)  
	Its better to bowl round the wicket most of the time to right-handers.     
	I am a left-arm spinner. I often bowl too many wide balls. Please help.  
	(Rohit Basu, Howrah)              
	Make sure you are looking at the spot you want to bowl and your head is steady.                 
	I am a left-handed batsman. I have a high back lift and that leads to problems when tackling shortpitched deliveries. Please help.  
	(Sanjoy Pattnaik, 19, Balasore)              
	Watch the ball. Use the depth of the crease when playing back so that you get that extra bit of time.                 
	I am an all-rounder. I need to do some weight training to strengthen the muscles in my upper body. Should it be done during the off season?  
	(Punit Jaiswal, Howrah)              
	Yes, thats the best time to get into shape.

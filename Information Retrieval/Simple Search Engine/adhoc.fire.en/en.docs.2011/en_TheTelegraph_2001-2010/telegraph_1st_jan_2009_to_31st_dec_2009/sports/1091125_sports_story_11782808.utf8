The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Asif scalps three on return to Test arena
                                                                                                                       7                                        Asif scalps three on return to Test arena
                  Mohammed Asif celebrates a wicket with a teammate in Dunedin on Tuesday                     
	Dunedin: Pacer Mohammed Asif celebrated his recall to international cricket with three vital wickets as New Zealand hobbled to 276 for six at stumps on Tuesday, Day I of the first Test against Pakistan.         
	A fielding lapse denied Asif his fourth on a day of struggle for the New Zealand batsmen after they were sent in to bat in reasonable conditions.         
	Daniel Vettori escaped a golden duck in one of three dropped catches that proved costly for Pakistan and allowed the home side to build two solid partnerships and recover from a first-ball dismissal.         
	Ross Taylor and Martin Guptill scripted a 117-run rescue stand for the third wicket, while Vettori and Brendon McCullum had put on an unbroken 65 for the seventh wicket.         
	At stumps, Vettori was on 40 and McCullum on 25 after successfully appealing against a leg-before dismissal on the penultimate ball of the day. The new Decision Review System (DRS) is in operation in this Test. The New Zealand batting had that familiar air of frailty as Asif posted three for 76 in 24 overs.         
	Md Aamer had two for 62 and Umar Gul, though wicketless, bowled seven maidens in his first nine overs.         
	Asif, who arrived in New Zealand vowing to resurrect a promising career that has been marred by injury and drug scandals, took wickets in the first and last sessions of the day. But it was the 17-year-old Md Aamer who took the early plaudits after captain Md Yousuf won the toss and put the hosts in to bat.         
	Aamer justified the decision with the opening delivery when he yorked Tim McIntosh with a ball that ricocheted off the bat and onto the leg stump.

	DAY I in kanpur  
	For the first time in their Test history, India managed to score over 400 runs on a single day. There have been 51 occasions when a team has scored 400-plus runs on a single day, with 30 of those coming on the first day.  
	The 233-run stand between Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir bettered Indias previous best for the opening wicket against Sri Lanka in Tests. Navjot Singh Sidhu and Manoj Prabhkar had scored 171 at SSC, Colombo, in 1993.  
	This is the first time since his 130 against New Zealand in Mohali in October 2003 that Sehwag has not scored over 150 in an innings, even after scoring a century. He had 11 scores of 150-plus in a row, before this knock.  
	Gambhirs century was his seventh hundred in his last nine Test matches.  
	COMPILED BY MOHANDAS MENON

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | East Bengal look for a big victory
                                                   East Bengal look for a big victory
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: For East Bengal, Wednesdays encounter against Eastern Railway  their first match in the Calcutta Football League (CFL), will be an opportunity to get back to winning ways as their journey, so far in the season, has been disastrous.         
	But on the eve of the match and exactly four days before their I-League derby against Mohun Bagan on Sunday, misfortune is still chasing the red and gold brigade as two of their key players, Alvito DCunha and Saumik Dey, were ruled out Tuesday, with torn tissues.         
	East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick blamed the artificial turf of the Salt Lake Stadium for Saumiks injury. There will be many more injuries like this in the future, he remarked.         
	With the CFL being held simultaneously with the I-League, the latter will be the obvious preference of the coaches, who have to handle their squads carefully, so that there are no burnout cases. Bhowmick proved he is not keen to be an exception, when he said he would not be playing most of his first team players on the morrow.         
	I have a very important game coming up on Sunday. So I wont be risking the first team players. But it will certainly not be a second string side as the others are quite capable. I have the experience of coaching in Goa, where I have seen that they dont mix up the local league with the I-League, Bhowmick said Tuesday.         
	The CFL has its own unique charm and I dont think anyone should worry about that. We cant help it If every team has to play in this format, so do we, he added.         
	Ghanaian Abel Hammond will be the lone foreigner in East Bengal line-up, as of now, with countryman Yusif Yakubu, the other registered foreigner for East Bengal being kept fresh for the derby. Subhas Singh, in all probability, will partner Hammond upfront.         
	Among the absentees in the starting eleven Wednesday, will be defender Mehrajuddin Wadoo, and it will be interesting to find out how the defence, which has often looked porous this season, shapes up against Eastern Railway.         
	Talking about his opponents, Bhowmick said: They are unknown rivals I dont have any idea about them.         
	A win, that too by a handsome margin, is the need of the hour for East Bengal, and the CFL could well be the morale booster they need to do well in the I-League.

                                                     Becks: Its a dream come true
            Rory Smith            David Beckham                           
	David Beckham has described the timeshare agreement that will mean he stays with AC Milan until the end of the season as a dream come true.         
	The England internationals deal will result in him staying with the Serie A side until the end of the Italian season before returning to Los Angeles Galaxy on June 30 for the rest of the Major League Soccer campaign.         
	It is believed he will then exercise a get-out clause in his Galaxy contract halfway through the five-year deal, in October, to join Milan on a permanent basis, although he will not be able to play again until he can be registered in January.         
	Milan had originally baulked at the Galaxys 10million asking price for a permanent deal, offering only $3?million (2.1million) to extend his loan until November. It is thought the two sides have agreed a fee of around 5million.         
	Beckham will continue much of the promotional work he is committed to in order to boost the games profile in America.         
	As part of the deal Milan will play a friendly at the Galaxys Home Depot Center on July 19, while Galaxy have announced season ticket prices will be cut by 10 per cent as Beckham will miss more than half of their season.         
	Beckham said: Im grateful to both teams for making this dream come true, allowing me to play for Milan and the Galaxy in the same season, as well as allowing me to continue my work for MLS and the development of soccer in the US, which is something Im very passionate about.         
	The former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder is believed to have taken a substantial salary cut to help Milan finance the move, while he will have to pay a hefty compensation fee to Galaxy should he buy himself out of his contract later this year. Beckhams family will remain in Los Angeles, a sign of how desperate he was to seal a move which he sees as vital if he is to feature in Fabio Capellos plans for next years World Cup.         
	The England manager has made no secret of his belief that the standard of play in the MLS was too low for Beckham to remain in contention. Yet Beckhams future remains uncertain.         
	The Milan manager, Carlo Ancelotti, may be replaced in the summer, with former Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard rumoured to be his heir apparent.         
	Such a change, combined with an increased financial stringency, could herald a sea-change in Milans recruitment policy as they bid to refresh a first XI which regularly contains just four players under the age of 30.

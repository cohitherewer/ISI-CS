    Inzamam irked
    Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq Wednesday slammed the cricket authorities of the country for demanding no objection certificate rsquo;s from the ICL for their players to be considered for national selection. ldquo;On one hand the PCB says it does not recognise the ICL which it considers an unauthorised tournament while on the other, it is asking the players to get NOCs from the same league. If they want NOCs basically it means the Board is recognising the ICL, rdquo; Inzamam said on the sidelines of a function in Lahore.

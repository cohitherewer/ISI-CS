	Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Waqar Younis has taken a dig at Indian Cricket League (ICL) recruits who want to play for the country again, saying financial uncertainty surrounding the Twenty20 event seems to be the reason for their urge to return to the national fold.         
	Waqar, talking to reporters in Lahore on Sunday, said he was surprised at the eagerness of some of the ICL players now to play for their country.         
	I wonder if it is because they are not getting paid by the ICL now. There was no talk about playing for the national team when they were getting their payments from the ICL. So why now? he asked.         
	Waqar said he had nothing against cricketers playing for the ICL, IPL or any other foreign league but they should take responsibility for their actions. I wouldnt mind seeing these ICL players back in action for the national team but I think there must a cooling period for these players so that they know they cant just go and play in unauthorised events and then return when they want.         
	Waqar was also cautious about fit-again mercurial pacer Shoaib Akhtars comeback.         
	Definitely he is looking trimmer and fitter and he is working hard. But he has been injury-prone and we should not be expecting too much of him in his first full series after a long time, he said.         
	The former skipper said it would not be easy for Shoaib to play against Australia in Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the upcoming ODI series as the conditions there are not ideal for fast bowling.         
	It will be tough for the bowlers I guess because it is hot and humid. But this is one series where Shoaib can announce his comeback in a big way, he noted.         
	Waqar rated Australia as favourites for the series.         
	But it will be a tough series for both sides and if Pakistan play to their potential, we will see some exciting cricket, he added. (PTI)

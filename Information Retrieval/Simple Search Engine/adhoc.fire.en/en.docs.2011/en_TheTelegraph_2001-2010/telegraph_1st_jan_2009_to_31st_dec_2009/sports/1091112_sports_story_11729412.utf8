The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Final one-dayer washed out
                                                                                                                                   Final one-dayer washed out

	Mumbai: Team Indias hopes, if any, of salvaging pride failed to materialise as heavy rains washed out their final one-day International (ODI) against Australia at the DY Patil Stadium here on Wednesday.         
	Australia thus won the seven-match series 4-2. Australian all-rounder Shane Watson was adjuged the Man of the Series.         
	Watson scored 256 runs in six innings at an average of 42.66 and snared 10 wickets, the highest among the Aussies, in the series.         
	Fans who had arrived at the venue, which was set to host its first international game, had to return empty handed, literally, as play was abandoned at 5 pm, two-and-a-half hours after the scheduled start, without a ball being bowled.         
	The spectators disappointment must have been aggravated as the Board of Control for Cricket in India wouldnt refund their ticket money despite the match being insured against such disruptions.         
	It is clearly printed on the back of the ticket that there would not be any refund, Ratnakar Shetty, BCCIs chief administrative officer, said.         
	It maybe recalled that in a similar instance, when the India-South Africa ODI in Chennai in 2005-06 was washed out, the organisers were ordered by the High Court to refund 50 per cent of the ticket price to the fans.         
	India coach Gary Kirsten made a brief visit to the stadium in the morning to get first hand information about the ground conditions. The rest of the Indian team, as well as the Aussies, remained indoors.         
	As the focus shifts to the Test and ODI series against Sri Lanka, the Indians have a couple of days to regroup, mentally and physically, before they assemble in Ahmedabad for the first Test starting on November 16.         
	The positives which the Indians can take forward from the Australia series are  Sachin Tendulkars masterpiece in Hyderabad, Mahendra Singh Dhonis rediscovering his batting form, Harbhajan Singh being among wickets and the all-round performances of Ravindra Jadeja and Praveen Kumar.         
	Praveen has the skippers faith in him and, with some more improvement, could turn out to be a Shane Watson for India.         
	The Uttar Pradesh player has handled the responsibility of the new ball well, apart from being sharp in the Powerplays. The 23-year-old showed his maturity by concentrating on line and length and varying the pace instead of attempting to bowl fast. His contribution with the bat has also helped the team.

	Calcutta: East Bengal, after a nightmarish start to the season, are trying to knit all the loose ends and bring the much needed stability in their performance before Sundays derby.         
	A key member to that scheme is Ghanaian striker Yusif Yakubu. His pairing with Bhaichung Bhutia will be crucial to the red and gold brigades fortunes when they lock horns with arch-rivals Mohun Bagan in the I-League encounter.         
	But Yakubu, after practice at the club ground Friday, said that their combination would need some more time be in full flow.         
	Its good... Playing with Bhaichung is great, but I think we need a little bit of time to be better. We havent really played a lot this season together So a few more matches will help in getting the combination better, said Yakubu.         
	He also said that the inclusion of fellow Ghanaian Abel Hammond in the squad will only enhance the teams attacking abilities. Now that we have Hammond, a lot more opportunities will be created. So it will be good if Hammond plays, he said.         
	He however expressed concerns over the artificial turf at the Salt Lake Stadium. Its a bit difficult The bounce is low and it is difficult to control the ball, he said.         
	The natural turf is always better than the artificial one. Even in the European countries, the artificial turfs are mostly used for training and not really for matches. But a lot of things are changing in Indian soccer, and I guess we will have to put up with it, Yakubu added.         
	There were two new additions to East Bengals armoury Friday as the club registered Nigerian defender Ogba Opara and Australian midfielder Secro Mitrovich. While Oparas inclusion completes the three foreigners quota, Yakubu and Hammond being the other two, Mitrovich has been signed as the Asian quota player.         
	Bagan, on the other hand, will be buoyed by the fact that their flag bearer for years, Jose Ramirez Barreto, who is nursing a quadriceps injury, started training with the ball Friday.         
	However, coach Karim Bencharifa said that whether the Brazilian will be available for Sundays match will be left to him to decide. Barreto is a professional and he knows the importance of the game. We have left it to him to decide whether he will play or not, the Moroccan said.

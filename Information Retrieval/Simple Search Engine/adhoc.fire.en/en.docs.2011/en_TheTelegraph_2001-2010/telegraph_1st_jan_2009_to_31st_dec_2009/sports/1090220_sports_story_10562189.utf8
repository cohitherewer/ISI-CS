	Calcutta: Shiv Kapur of India will need a miracle to make the cut after a horrendous opening round of six-over 78 left him tied at 152nd in the Johnnie Walker Classic at the Vine Resort and Country Club, here Thursday. The Delhi pro bogeyed half of the 18 holes.         
	He got off to an ominous start and the hattrick of bogeys was a sign of things in store for him. Kapur birdied sixth and seventh holes but bogeyed the fifth and ninth to take the turn at three-over.         
	On his way back, the Indian bogeyed the 13th, 14th, 15th and 17th as well to see his campaign in complete disarray.         
	Meanwhile, Dutchman Robert-jan Derksen fired a blistering eight-under-par 64 to take the first round lead with Singaporean Mardan Mamat leading the chasing pack.         
	Derksen crafted a flawless round, which included eight birdies, to lead by one stroke from Mardan and Australian Tony Carolan.         
	Irishman Damien McGrane and English duo Lee Westwood and John Bickerton were a further stroke back while last weeks Malaysian Open winner Anthony Kang of the United States and European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie were amongst those bunched on 67.         
	Australian great Greg Norman, making his first appearance on home soil since 2006, endured a frustrating day on the greens en route to a 75. The 54-year-old Norman could not buy a putt and three-putted on three occasions to leave himself with a fight on his hands to make the cut on Friday.         
	I actually felt good. I hit one bad drive and took a double bogey and took three three-putts. Seventy-five is a bit of a shock to me, but thats my score and Ive got to take it, said the Great White Shark.         
	Derksen was delighted to be challenging for a third career title. Ive played this course a few times, I know the course really well, said the 35-year-old, whose last victory came in 2005.         
	I think it suits my game. Ive been struggling a little bit with my driver lately, but I think this week, its just more position play. Its a good start and its always nice to have a chance.

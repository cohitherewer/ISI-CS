	Adelaide: All-rounder Dwayne Bravo scored his third Test century as the West Indies ended the first day of their second Test against Australia at the Adelaide Oval on 336 for six.         
	The visitors could have been in a better position but for Shivnarine Chanderpauls dismissal after a review of the umpires decision, according to Cricinfo.         
	Bravos century ensured a healthy total for the Caribbeans, who had lost the first Test in Brisbane in three days. However, on a good batting surface, six opening-day wickets is not bad for Australia.         
	Darren Sammy provided some late-afternoon entertainment with a pair of sixes down the ground off Nathan Hauritz, and he was unbeaten on 44 at the close, with Brendan Nash also on 44, having earlier retired hurt.         
	Bravo rode his luck to reach triple figures after being dropped three times, but Chanderpaul ran out of luck when he was on 62. The gritty left-hander was given out caught behind off Shane Watson after the Australians asked for a review as umpire Mark Benson had ruled Chanderpaul not out.         
	Chanderpaul had earlier survived a similar review off Doug Bollinger on 38, when the evidence was inconclusive despite the Australians being utterly convinced that he had edged the ball.         
	Watson was pleased to redeem himself after his comical mishap gave Bravo a reprieve on 59. Bravo hooked Peter Siddle, and Watson tried to snare the catch at deep square leg but stumbled back and lobbed the ball up as he realised he would step over the boundary.         
	It left West Indies in a spot of bother after they lost three wickets in the opening session, including Ramnaresh Sarwan, whose return from a back injury ended on 28 when he drove Johnson on the up to Clarke at point.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengals ICL players to wait and watch
                                                   Bengals ICL players to wait and watch
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The seven Bengal players  Deep Dasgupta, Rohan Gavaskar, Avishek Jhunjhunwala, Shiv Sagar Singh, Eklakh Ahmed, Subhomoy Das and Subhajit Pal  who joined the Indian Cricket League in 2007 have decided to adopt a wait and watch policy before coming to a decision on the BCCIs offer for them to return to official cricket.         
	Deep termed the move a positive development. But a few among them said they were surprised by the sudden decision that came after the BCCI working committee meeting in Mumbai on Wednesday afternoon.         
	According to sources, at least three of the players are not averse to returning to the BCCI fold. The players, however, insisted they had not approached the BCCI for help.         
	It is a positive decision but I am not sure what my next move would be, Deep said.         
	It would be premature to make a comment. There are pros and cons and we also need to check the legal bindings. It depends on the individual I have not decided and need some time to think about it, the former Bengal captain, who plays for the Royal Bengal Tigers in the ICL, said.         
	Shiv Sagar, Eklakh and Subhomoy echoed Deep when they said they would be cautious in making a decision.         
	Look, we just want to play cricket. It is good that the Board has finally decided to lift the ban but I really have no idea what the ICL authorities would do, Shiv Sagar said.         
	We are not playing much cricket these days. What we want is more cricket. We are not at all unhappy joining the ICL What I feel is that it is far better than the IPL... It would be great that we would again start playing in the Maidan But I am still sceptical. I will wait to see how ICL reacts to this before deciding what to do, the left-arm spinner said.         
	Rohan also termed it a positive development. It is obviously a good move But I feel it will be too early to react now. The decision came today in the afternoon and I need some time to decide, Rohan said from Mumbai.         
	It was learnt that the ICL officials, soon after the BCCIs announcement, phoned the players and urged them to carry on with the rebel league.         
	Yes a senior official called me up and said that there is nothing to worry about and that the ICL will operate smoothly, a player said.         
	We have got enough time in hand to think about it. We need to think in a proper way so that there is no problem again, Eklakh said.         
	Former Test player Ashok Malhotra, who is with the rebel league as mentor, declined comment. Look I need to know the terms and conditions before I can comment on this, he said.

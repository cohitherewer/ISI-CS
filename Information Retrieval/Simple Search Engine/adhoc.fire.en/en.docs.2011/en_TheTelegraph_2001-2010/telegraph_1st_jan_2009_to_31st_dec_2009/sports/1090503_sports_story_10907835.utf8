The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We cant get across the line, rues Brendon McCullum
                                                     We cant get across the line, rues Brendon McCullum
    - Kolkata Knight Riders try to be different, but still fail             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Brad Hodge                                 
	East London: Its a match the Kolkata Knight Riders shouldve won. As it turned out, they lost to the Mumbai Indians  again, this time by nine runs (139 for six, challenging 148 for six)  on a featherbed here on Friday.         
	Captain Brendon McCullum did a few things differently, including opening with Sourav Ganguly and pushing himself down the order, but nothing worked. Sourav was bowled first ball, while McCullum didnt fare much better either.         
	At one stage, with Brad Hodge (top scorer with 73) and Morne van Wyk looking stronger with each over, it seemed victory was assured. They added 89 for the third-wicket, but the ending of their partnership saw the challenge fizzle out.         
	With six wickets in hand, the Knights needed 23 from the last two overs. Lasith Malinga bowled a terrific 19th  conceding four (an over which saw Hodge run out)  and part-timer Abhishek Nayar was brilliant in the 20th. An India prospect, he gave away only seven runs and got McCullums wicket.         
	Later, Malinga told The Telegraph: I wouldnt like to take credit... Nayar deserves it... I just had one goal  not to concede a boundary in my last over... Im happy I didnt and helped my team.         
	McCullum and Co. left for Port Elizabeth (venue for the next match, against the Kings XI Punjab, on Sunday) by coach, within an hour after the latest defeat.         
	Before that, however, McCullum and the Mumbai Indians captain, Sachin Tendulkar, whod won the toss, took questions from the media.                 
	The following are excerpts               
	SACHIN: Our bowlers did a fantastic job and the strategy worked... I intentionally held back the last over by the fifth bowler (Nayar)... Id realised theyd be looking to target that one over... Id opened the bowling with Graham Napier as nobody had seen him... Tried to catch the opposition off-guard... We always had the match under control, though the partnership (between Hodge and Van Wyk) did become dangerous... I didnt really worry as the bowlers were on target... They held nerve at the end too... When we batted (MoM Jean-Paul) Duminy set it up for us with an unbeaten 52...         
	Im also happy with the way we fielded... Were here to win, not finish fifth again... We arent a team to talk big, for cricket is played (and issues settled) on the field.         
	McCULLUM: We cant get across the line... The guys, however, were desperate... Except for a few overs at the end, wed bowled well and the intensity was good on the field... We had an excellent partnership, but lost wickets at key moments... Sachin held back the last over of his fifth bowler... Right through the tournament, weve had our moments, but have never played to our absolute ability... The team culture, though, is still strong and, for a losing dressing room, the guys are sticking together... I cant ask for more from the guys... Results-wise, weve fallen behind, but thats not the case with our ability... Whats missing? Us winning... Weve lost three close matches and need a lot of things to go our way... We arent giving up.

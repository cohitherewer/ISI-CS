                                                     Bagan capitulate without a fight
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Mohun Bagans Jose Ramirez Barreto gets past Mahindra United players in New Delhi on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                           
	New Delhi: An unimpressive Mohun Bagan were forced to settle for the second spot in the I-League when they went down to Mahindra United 1-2 in the concluding match on Thursday.         
	Faced with a situation where their title hopes were mainly dependent on the Churchill versus Mohammedan Sporting match in Goa, the Calcutta giants dished out an insipid performance to surrender all three points to Mahindra at the Ambedkar Stadium here.         
	The match attracted a fairly big crowd that included the national coach Bob Houghton, a good number of officials from the Second Division I-League clubs and local football fans. The national hockey coach-in-charge Harendra Singh, sat in the Press Gallery as no one bothered to offer him a chair in the VIP arena.         
	But then, most in the stands lost interest within 10 minutes of the start as news trickled in from Goa that Churchill had already pumped in two goals past Mohammedan Sporting. The only interest left was to see whether Mohun Bagan could finish at par with Churchill on the points table before losing out on goal difference.         
	Unfortunately, Mohun Bagan did not look capable of catching up with Churchill. With Marcos Pereira and Rakesh Masih missing from the ranks, the Calcutta teams makeshift midfield looked an unsure lot and failed to penetrate, especially in the first half.         
	And once Nigerian Edeh Chidi beat Sangram Mukherjee under the Mohun Bagan bar with his fast movements and clever placing in the 41st minute, spectators were left with little doubt about the outcome.         
	True, Mohun Bagan were a more composed side in the second session. Both Bhaichung Bhutia and Jose Barreto tried their best to repair the damage but another goal by Chidi against the run of play in the 58th minute broke the backbone of the Calcutta side. Branco Cardozo managed to pull one back in the last minute but that was all the green and maroon side could do.         
	In the end, Mohun Bagan could hang on to the runners-up spot on the basis of better goal difference. Both Mohun Bagan and Sporting Clube de Goa, who beat Air India 3-1 in Gurgaon, finished with 43 points each.         
	Mahindra were fifth on the league table after finishing with Dempo on 31 points. The Goa side ended fourth by virtue of a better goal difference.         
	Like Mohun Bagan, Mahindra, too, were not in their full strength. Steven Dias could not play because of two yellow cards and coach, Derek Pereira, did not field NP Pradeep, another national team star.         
	I thought of using him later, said Pereira . We were up by two goals by the 58th minute, so Pradeep was not needed. I expected Mohun Bagan to play an open game and it did help my team, added the Mahindra coach.         
	Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa congratulated Churchill Brothers for their maiden I-League triumph. At the same time he hinted that his team would go for the kill in the Super Cup match against the Goa side.         
	We have to redeem ourselves in the Super Cup, said the Moroccan coach.

                  Air India Red players with the BCCI Corporate Trophy in Bangalore on Tuesday                     
	Bangalore: Robin Uthappa cracked an unbeaten 157 and Yuvraj Singh took three crucial wickets as Air India Red beat Air India Blue by 93 runs to lift the inaugural BCCI Corporate Trophy Tuesday.         
	Put into bat at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, Air India Red rode Uthappas blistering 148-ball innings to post a challenging total of 284 for eight, and then returned to bundle out Air India Blue for a meagre 191 in 41.5 overs to win the one-day tournament.         
	Air India Red skipper Yuvraj was the wrecker-in-chief with three crucial wickets, including the prized scalps of Kaif (32) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (0) off consecutive balls.         
	For Air India Blue, only Chandan Madan put up a resistance with 85. (PTI)

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Mahesh Bhupathi                           
	New Delhi: Mahesh Bhupathi is confident India will be able to sweep all gold medals in the tennis event of the Commonwealth Games next year.         
	Talking to the media on the sidelines of a promotional in the capital on Wednesday, the winner of 11 Grand Slam titles said no other team in the Commonwealth Games looked like beating the Indians.         
	I am sure, ours would be the best team, Bhupathi said. With me, Leander (Paes), Somdev (Dev Varman), Rohan (Bopanna) and Sania (Mirza) in the team, we should be able to clinch every gold medal out there.         
	As to his own form, the doubles ace said he was hoping to do much better next year with Max Mirnyi of Belarus. In the Chennai Open, however, Bhupathi will team up with compatriot Rohan Bopanna.         
	Ideally, I would have loved to start the season with Mirnyi but since he is not coming, I will be pairing up with Rohan. He is a very good player and I am sure we will be able to do well in Chennai, said Bhupathi.

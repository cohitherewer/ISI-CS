The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Injured Flintoff returns home
                                                   Injured Flintoff returns home
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Chennai Super Kings all-rounder Andrew Flintoff returned home on Friday to undergo surgery on a torn meniscus in his right knee.         
	The tear means that Flintoff, apart from missing the remainder of the IPL 2009, would also be unavailable for the two-match Test series at home against the West Indies commencing May 6.         
	The England cricketer, who was bought for a record $1.55 million by the Chennai franchise, complained of discomfort in his right-knee, following which, the Super Kings medical staff contacted the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB)s chief medical officer, Dr Nick Peirce.         
	Scans taken in a Durban hospital revealed a slight medial meniscal tear and, once the report had been reviewed by Peirce and the radiologists, it was decided Flintoff should return to London.         
	The operation is scheduled for next week and surgeons are confident Flintoff should recover from the keyhole surgery within three to five weeks which means the Lancashire lad would be available for the ICC world T20 and the Ashes.         
	The T20 event starts on June 5 with England taking on the Netherlands in the opening match of the tournament at Lords. The first Test of the five-match Ashes series begins July 8 in Cardiff.         
	Dr Peirce said: Clearly this is a huge disappointment for both the player and the IPL team. This sort of degenerative injury though is one that could have happened at any time anywhere.         
	The procedures we put in place meant that the ECB medical staff were alerted about the problem immediately and we thank Chennai (Super Kings) for their co-operation.         
	Hugh Morris, the ECB managing director added: Andrew has been extremely unlucky with injuries but if there is one saving grace it is that the injury has occurred now rather than on the eve of either the ICC World Twenty20 or the Ashes.         
	Having the surgery now means that Flintoff should be available for both those events although he is certain to miss the Test series against the West Indies.         
	Flintoff endured a difficult few weeks since joining the Chennai franshise. His return of 0/50 against Delhi DareDevils was the most expensive of any IPL bowler through Thursday, and his 1/44 against Mumbai Indians barely better.         
	In all, Flintoff claimed two wickets at 52.50 (and an economy rate of 9.54) in three games with the Super Kings. He fared better with the bat, averaging a respectable 31.00 at better than a run-a-ball in three innings.         
	Flintoffs torn knee meniscus represents the second major injury to befall a Chennai Super Kings player in as many seasons. Matthew Hayden tore an Achilles tendon during his four-game stint in the inaugural IPL, and was subsequently ruled out of Australias tour of the West Indies.

                                                   Indian men in recurve final
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Indian mens recurve team put up a brilliant performance on Saturday as they reached the final of the recurve team championship in the World Cup archery meet (Stage 1) at Santo Domingo in Dominican Republic.         
	The team, consisting of Rahul Banerjee, Mangal Singh Champia and Jayanta Talukdar, overcame stiff resistance from a strong US side winning by 219-215 points in the semi-final.         
	India will play Britain in the gold medal play-off.         
	The womens compound team, comprising Jhano Hansdah, Bheigybati Chanu and Manjudha Soy, will take on Venezuela in the bronze medal play-off. Earlier, the Indians beat Colombia 207-200 in the quarter final but lost to the US in the semi-final at 220-225.         
	However, the womens recurve side and mens compound team failed to live up to the expectations. The threesome of Dola Banerjee, L. Bombayla Devi and Reena Kumar lost to Britain by just a point at 207-208 in the quarter final.         
	The mens compound outfit, consisting of Khuraijam Ratan Singh, Chungda Sherpa and Chinna Raju Srither, lost to Mexico 214-218 in the quarter final.

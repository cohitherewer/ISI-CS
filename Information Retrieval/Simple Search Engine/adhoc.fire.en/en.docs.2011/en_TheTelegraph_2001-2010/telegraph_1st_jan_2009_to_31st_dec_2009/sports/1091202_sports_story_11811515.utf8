            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan, ahead of the Federation Cup next month, will once again look to sharpen their skills when they take on Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) in a CFL Premier Division match Wednesday.         
	Having scrapped past Calcutta Customs 1-0 in the last match, coach Karim Bencharifa will expect a better show on Wednesday. However, Japanese Ryuji Sueoka may not don the strikers role like in the last match and will probably move to the right flank.

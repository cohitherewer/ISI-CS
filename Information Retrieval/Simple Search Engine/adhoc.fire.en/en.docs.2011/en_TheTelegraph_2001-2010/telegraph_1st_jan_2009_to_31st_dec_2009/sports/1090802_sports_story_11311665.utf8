                                                   Bangla win 3-0
                      
	Basseterre: Half-centuries by Junaid Siddique and Mahmudullah led Bangladesh to a three-wicket victory, and a 3-0 clean sweep of the one-day International series over the West Indies.         
	Siddique struck six fours for 55 from 73 balls, and Mahmudullah, named the Man of the Match, hit two fours and one six in an unbeaten 51 from 70 balls to help Bangladesh overhaul the target of 249 in the third and final ODI at Warner Park Friday.           (AFP)

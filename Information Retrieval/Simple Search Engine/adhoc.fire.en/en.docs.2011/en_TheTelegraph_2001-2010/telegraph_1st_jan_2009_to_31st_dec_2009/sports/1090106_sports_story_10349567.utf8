The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev fancies strong finish
                                                     Jeev fancies strong finish
                  Jeev Milkha                     
	Dubai: The Major dream may take some time to materialise but Jeev Milkha Singh, at the top of his game, has this hunch that a strong finish is very much on the cards when he tees off at the Dubai Desert Classic later this month.         
	The Asian No. 1 considers Dubai his home away from home and fancies his chances in the European Tour event at the Emirates Golf Club from January 26 to February 1.         
	Of course, I would love to have a Major under my belt before my golfing career is over, but there are other tournaments like the Dubai Desert Classic which are very close to my heart, said Jeev, who had a fairytale 2008 which yielded four titles on three different tours.         
	Dubai is a fantastic place. I have always felt very good being there. In fact, I can call it a home away from home, said the Indian.         
	When it comes to winning a tournament, it all depends on the mindset that week and how you deal with the pressure. Somehow, I have this intrinsic feeling that I would do well in Dubai, said Jeev who touched a career-high ranking of 35 after his win in the Golf Nippon Series JT Cup in Japan.         
	Jeev says he will draw motivation from his thrilling one-stroke victory at the Barclays Singapore Open ahead of the likes of Padraig Harrington, Ernie Els and Phil Mickelson.         
	I was happy I could win against the top players in the world and this will give me a lot of confidence to move on to better things, said Jeev, who hopes to break into the top 20 by the end of 2009.         
	For that to happen, I need to be physically fit and mentally refreshed for every tournament I enter, the Chandigarh-based golfer was quoted as saying in a release.         
	Jeev, however, has set his eyes on a bigger goal and said: I have proved myself again and now its time to move on to bigger things. I think Ive got the game, and the confidence, to win any tournament, even a Major.         
	Organisers of the Dubai Desert Classic are also excited at having roped in Jeev for the event.         
	When Jeev steps up to the tee, its obvious dedication and discipline are in his genes, not to mention the gentle smile of his father, said Mohamed Juma Buamaim, CEO of golf in Dubai, promoters of the $2.5 million event.         
	We are delighted to welcome back the ace Indian golfer, who is a well established international star with a tremendous fan-following.         
	Without doubt his contribution to Asian golf has been immense and he is also considered among the elite on the Japanese and the European Tour, Buamaim said.         
	I am sure his presence will provide a major boost to our tournament which this year is celebrating its 20th anniversary, he added.         
	2008 has been a good year for Jeev. In the season-ending Golf Nippon Series JT Cup in December, Jeev put behind a personal tragedy en route to perhaps the most emotional victory of his career.         
	With his wife recuperating in a local hospital in Tokyo after delivering a still-born child, Jeev had decided to withdraw from the tournament but his wife, Kudrat, urged him to play on and Jeev eventually went on to claim his second Japan Tour title of the year  his fourth of the season.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No IPL regrets for   Flintoff
                                                   No IPL regrets for   Flintoff
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                                  
	Andrew Flintoff has said he has no regrets about playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL), despite suffering a knee injury that ruled him out of the first part of Englands busy summer.         
	The Lancashire all-rounder already has his sights set on facing Australia in the Ashes series starting in July, after undergoing surgery on a torn cartilage.         
	My injury was building up and while its frustrating, at least it happened now, the 31-year-old told The Sun.         
	There was always going to be people commenting about it. But it wasnt one incident that did it, it was a gradual thing that had built up over time.         
	I would have been playing for Lancashire had it not been Chennai in the IPL, so this would have happened.         
	Flintoff, who played for the Chennai Super Kings, is expected to be fit for the Twenty20 World Cup in June but says the prospect of facing Australia is driving him on to get fit.         
	When youve had the problems Ive had, with the ankle operations and now my knee, then its the dream of playing Ashes cricket and beating Australia that keeps you going, he said.         
	Thats the motivation during rehab but when the time comes around I have to make sure Im on top of my game, too.         
	It is the series you want to play in. People ask if the 5-0 whitewash in 2006-07 motivates me for revenge.         
	But, to be honest, I dont need any more motivation than just to play in The Ashes again.

  - Third ashes test flintoff half-century gives hosts 113-run lead               Ben Hilfenhaus at Edgbaston on Sunday. (AP)                           
	Birmingham: Andrew Flintoffs brisk 74 helped England to 316 for seven at tea Sunday on the fourth day of the third Ashes Test. The hosts led by 53 runs.               
	At stumps, Australia were 88 for two in their second innings. Opener Shane Watson was unbeaten on 34 while Mike Hussey was on 18. England were bowled out for 376, earning a 113-run lead               
	On a day that began an hour late at Edgbaston because of a wet outfield, England lost Ian Bell for 53 and Matt Prior for 41 after lunch. But Flintoff then played a typically aggressive innings, hitting 10 fours and a six in 79 balls before being dismissed just before tea.         
	Flintoff tried to leave a short delivery from off-spinner Nathan Hauritz but was helpless as the ball spun back into him and flicked his glove on the way to Michael Clarke at slip. Flintoff received a standing ovation as he made his way off the ground.         
	Australia, seeking to retain the Ashes and 0-1 down in the five-match series, will now struggle to force the pace of the game enough to chase an unlikely victory after 60 overs were lost to rain on Thursday and all of Saturday was washed out.         
	Flintoffs sixth-wicket partnership of 89 from 97 deliveries with Prior turned the match in Englands favour after Bell departed five overs after lunch. Bell, having already survived three close lbw appeals, was finally out to left-arm pacer Mitchell Johnson.         
	Flintoff soon asserted his authority and played a signature straight drive for four off medium-pacer Shane Watson in his first over. He played a second straight drive along the floor for another boundary in Watsons second over.         
	Allrounder Flintoff, who will retire from Tests after the series because of injury troubles, brought England level with Australias 263 with a six over long-on off Hauritz. A powerful sweep two balls later gave England the lead and Flintoff his half-century.         
	Peter Siddle unsettled Flintoff briefly when he struck him on the chest as the burly batsman took his eye off the ball. But that was a rare moment of unease as 13 came from that over.         
	Priors 59-ball effort ended when he mistimed a short ball from Siddle and managed only to scoop it to mid-on. But Stuart Broad (20 not out) did not allow the momentum to subside. He had a 50-run stand in 52 balls with Flintoff, who was out off the next delivery.         
	After England resumed on their overnight score of 116 for two, captain Andrew Strauss was caught by wicketkeeper Graham Manou for 69 off Ben Hilfenhaus, trying to cut a short ball that was too close to him.         
	Paul Collingwood was caught at second slip by Ricky Ponting off Hilfenhaus for 13 off the last ball before lunch.         
	Hilfenhaus was the pick of the bowlers, picking up three for 83 in 25 overs, while Siddle claimed two for 88 from 20 overs.           (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Semi-finals will be tricky: Dhoni
                                                   Semi-finals will be tricky: Dhoni
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Durban: The Chennai Super Kings put up a spirited performance on Wednesday night at Kingsmead to register a 24-run victory against the Kings XI Punjab and moved to the semi-finals as the second-placed team in the league table. Super Kings skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni looked relaxed and expressed views ahead of the semi-finals.               
	The following are excerpts from the press conference                 
	Your thoughts going into the semi-final         
	Its like a lottery from now on. Till now its been about the team. We had to play good, consistent cricket and win at least seven to eight games to qualify for the next stage of the tournament. But from now on its about those three-and-a-half hours. Somebody like a Hayden or a Raina can have a brilliant day or a bowler like Muralidharan can really take the team through.         
	Are you worried about the semi-final?         
	Its not about being worried or not. You have to face whoever it is. Its not about being overconfident or being afraid. We know the capabilities of our side. On a good day, when we play 80 per cent to our potential, we can be a tough side to beat. We want to enjoy, now that we are confirmed for the semi-finals. From tomorrow (Thursday) morning we start preparing for the semis. From now on, 15 minutes of madness and you cant really curse anyone. It will be tricky.         
	You have shown your temper quite publicly towards your teammates when they havent been up to the mark         
	Its very difficult to control your temper when you see that the people around you, who are so talented, are not using their talent to the maximum. That really bothers me. If I see a good player, I want him to perform at his best.One of the things that really disappoint me is when you have to grab the attention of the fielders, especially at the boundaries.         
	You have used Suresh Raina as a bowler a lot throughout the tournament         
	That has been a real bonus for us. Given the team composition with which we have been playing, accommodating another spinner would have been very difficult for us.         
	What is the update on Hayden? Was Badrinath carrying an injury today (Wednesday?)         
	Albie (Morkel) and Badri both had slight injuries. We were forced to play Badri because otherwise our batting would have been very weak. Hayden should be fine. He could have played this game if we had pushed him, but it will be good to have him fit for the semi-final.

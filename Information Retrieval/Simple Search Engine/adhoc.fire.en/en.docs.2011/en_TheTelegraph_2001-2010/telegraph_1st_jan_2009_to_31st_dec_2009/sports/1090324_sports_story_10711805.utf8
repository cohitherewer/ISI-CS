The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England will help Indians: Prasad
                                                   England will help Indians: Prasad
                      
	Auckland: Team India bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad said the Mahendra Singh Dhonis are keen for the Indian Premier League (IPL) to be staged in England as that would allow them a feel of the conditions before the T20 World Cup, which is to be hosted by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in June.         
	It would make sense to have the event in England as that would help our cricketers prepare for the T20 World Cup. They could get a good feel of the conditions there, Prasad said.         
	Interestingly, Gary Kirsten pointed out that Johannesburg would be freezing in May, when the tournament will enter its conclusive phase.         
	The organisers were forced to shift the IPL out of India after the government said it could not guarantee adequate security for the matches because the tournament would clash with general elections in April-May. The decision to shift was taken after the IPL schedule was reworked several times and yet no solution could be found.         
	Meanwhile, Prasad said he would join Chennai Super Kings as assistant coach this season. Prasad, who has brought the best out in Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma, Munaf Patel and Praveen Kumar, would assist former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming, who has been picked up by the Chennai franchise in a dual role of player-coach.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni had led the Super Kings to the IPL final in its inaugural season. I will be associated with the Chennai Super Kings in the IPL this year. I am looking forward to working with Fleming and Dhoni, Prasad, who last year was a part of the Bangalore Royal Challengers, said.

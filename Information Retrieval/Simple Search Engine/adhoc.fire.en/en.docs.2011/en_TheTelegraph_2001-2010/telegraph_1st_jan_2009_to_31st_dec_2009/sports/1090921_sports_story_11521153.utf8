	New Delhi: A double strike by Nigerian Edeh Chidi enabled Mohun Bagan beat Mahindra United 2-1 in the Durand Cup semi-finals at the Ambedkar Stadium, here on Sunday. Bagan thus entered final after a gap of five years.         
	The final to be played on Tuesday will be a repeat of the IFA Shield as Bagan will take on Goas Churchill Brothers. In Calcutta, Churchill had won 2-0 to bag their maiden Shield title.         
	In a match that never rose to great heights, the foreign power of Mohun Bagan was well evident as Chidi struck when it was needed most to spell the doom for the Mumbai outfit.         
	To add to Mahindras woes, seasoned midfielder James Singh came up with a sparkling performance. Apart from having a role to play behind both the goals, so brilliant was Jamess executions of the set pieces that it even overshadowed Mahindras Steven Dias, considered the best in this business in India.         
	Chidis match winner in the 76th minute was certainly the finest moment of the match. Mohun Bagan, who were leading by a 19th minute goal, conceded the equaliser in the 70th minute and looked clearly uncomfortable against repeated Mahindra forays. But Chidis second goal settled the issue.         
	Bagan earned a direct free 10 yards outside the Mahindra box and James Singh unleashed a brilliant shot that was almost going in before goalkeeper Subhashis Roy Chowdhury tipped it over the bar at the last moment.         
	Not to be disheartened, James was once again on the job from the flag kick. This time his curling kick came at the chest height and Chidi pounced on it to head the ball into the far post. The goal was a beauty and one of the best in the tournament.         
	Overall, Mohun Bagan were the deserving winners despite occasional hiccups in the middle. After the initial hesitance, their defence was rock solid as both Rakesh Masih and Mohanraj kept Dias under great check. Except for a few crosses and the free kick that brought the Mahindra equaliser, Dias could not not trouble the Bagan defence.         
	Mohun Bagans first goal was the result of another Jose Barreto-Chidi combination. At a time when the Mohun Bagan defence was looking harassed against the Mahindra attackers, the Calcutta team scored off a counter attack to tilt the balance in their favour.         
	James created the move when his long ball landed inside the Mahindra goal. Barreto was quick to go for a header but it proved to be ill directed. An alert Chidi rushed in from the right to slam the ball into the roof of the net.         
	Despite the lead, Mohun Bagans 27th entry into the final looked uncertain when Mahindra equalised. Barreto, who was well marked by the Mahindra defenders, committed a foul inside the Mohun Bagan half. As Steven Diass measured free kick floated into the box, Mohammed Rafi rose to head in his sixth goal of the season.         
	In the second half, Mahindra looked shade better but that was not enough to put Bagan on the backfoot.

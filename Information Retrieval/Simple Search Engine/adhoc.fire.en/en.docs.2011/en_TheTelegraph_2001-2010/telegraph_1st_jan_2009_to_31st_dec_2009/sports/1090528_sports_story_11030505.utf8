	Calcutta: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni retained his No. 1 position in the Reliance Mobile ICC Player Rankings for one-day International batsmen.

	Gayle went into the series trailing Dhoni by 33 points but after managing just 42 runs in the series, the Jamaican has dropped one place to third. Chanderpaul gained one place to be placed second. Yuvraj Singh was placed at the fourth spot.         
	Stuart Broad became Englands highest-ranked bowler in the ODI bowlers rankings.

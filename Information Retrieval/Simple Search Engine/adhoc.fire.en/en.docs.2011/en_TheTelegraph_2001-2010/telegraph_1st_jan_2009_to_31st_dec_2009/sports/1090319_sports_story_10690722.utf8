                                                     Six-under has SSP tied 6th 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            SSP Chowrasia                           
	Gurgaon: The newly acquired putter seems to have done a world of good to S.S.P. Chowrasia as he fired a six-under 66 to be at tied sixth on the opening day of the SAIL Open at the Classic Golf Resort on Wednesday.         
	The day, however, belonged to Chapchai Nirat of Thailand, who shot five birdies on either side of the turn to bring home a flawless 10-under 62 that saw him set a course record and open up a three shot lead over four players in second place in the $300,000 event.         
	Behind Nirat are Antonio Lascuna (The Philippines), Wisut Artjanawat (Thailand), Mark Purser (New Zealand) and veteran Mardan Mamat of Singapore. Three players follow them  Shamim Khan and S.S.P. Chowrasia of India and Richard Moir of Australia  at tied sixth.         
	Jyoti Randhwa, the home favourite, who is just back from his fine triumph at the Thailand Open, did not have a good day and endured a lukewarm start of 71 to be placed joint 76th.         
	On a day when the players went on a birdie spree as 22 players came five-under or better, Chowrasia and Shamim kept the Indian flag flying.         
	The Calcutta-based golfer, who did well with a new putter in the tournaments in Indonesia and Thailand, said: I made a couple of important birdie putts from 10 feet on the seventh and ninth today and that really got me going for the rest of the round.         
	The course, Chowrasia said, was playing really well. I feel comfortable on this course as I have won here in the past after having shot nine under.         
	Fourteen players, including five Indians  Rahil Gangjee, Rafiq Ali, Gaganjeet Bhullar, Ashok Kumar and Naman Dawar  shot five-under 67 for a share of the ninth place.         
	There were 19 players at tied 23rd with four-under 68 and the bunch included Shiv Kapur, Amandeep Johl, Arjun Singh, Vijay Kumar, Vinod Kumar, Sujjan Singh and C. Muniyappa.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Super sub Dipendu makes the difference
                                                                                                                       7                                        Super sub Dipendu makes the difference
            A STAFF REPORTER            Dipendu Biswas                           
	Calcutta: Substitute Dipendu Biswas scored from an Eduardo Escobar free-kick as Mohammedan Sporting defeated West Bengal Police 1-0 in a CFL Premier Division match at home on Tuesday.         
	Dipendus 60th-minute strike was the only silver lining during afternoon drudgery. Mohammedan Sporting now have 13 points from five matches, while the policemen, who completed their hattrick of losses, are yet to open their account.         
	After a barren 45 minutes when Mohammedan Sporting were waiting for things to happen, coach Shabbir Alis decision to introduce Dipendu and Dipankar Roy in place Lalcchuan Awma and Satyajit Bose respectively, worked wonders.         
	Eduardo kept a low free-kick from the left flank and Dipendu, who was lurking nearby, flicked home the winner.         
	It was yet another insipid performance by Mohammedan Sporting.         
	Save Eduardo who showed a lot of initiative in the built-ups, the likes of Theodore Sunday, Sovan Chakraborty, Bapi Chowdhury couldnt provide the required support.         
	Luckily for Sporting, the policemen didnt have the wherewithal to cause any ripple. The team reached the city from Dehradun, where they were participating in the National Police Games just a couple of hours before the match!

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its unusual for Lee
                                                   Its unusual for Lee
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nottingham: After a decade of cricket with a highly successful team, senior pro Brett Lee finds himself in an unusual situation: Hes not part of an Australian side considered the favourite to win a world event.         
	Yeah, its unusual, but at times its a good thing to be the underdogs, Lee told The Telegraph on Sunday, on the eve of Australias must-win World T20 match against Sri Lanka.         
	Lee added: Actually, the players can only do their best and well be doing just that at Trent Bridge tomorrow... I hope the weather holds.         
	An understandable concern that, as it poured for much of the day.

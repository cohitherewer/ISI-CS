                                                     Wasteful EB yet to earn victory
            A STAFF REPORTER            Bhaichung Bhutia makes one of his failed attempts at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Rennedy Singh was rueful and good friend Alvito DCunha was feeling frustrated. Three points were there for the taking. It just didnt happen, they agreed while coming out of the Salt Lake Stadiums media box.         
	True. Very true, in fact. East Bengal had JCT by their scruff, creating chance after chance only to let them off the hook with a goalless draw in their I-League match Sunday.         
	Bhaichung Bhutia failed to hit the far corner from close. Yusif Yakubu sent it over the bar with JCT goalkeeper Karanjit Singh at his mercy and Syed Rahim Nabi, amazingly (he later said that on any other day he would have hit the target), headed straight to Karanjit from handshaking distance.         
	The goalless draw means East Bengal await their first victory of the season. Next up for East Bengal are Mohun Bagan on October 25. Will that be their first win? On Sunday, East Bengal were in no mood to talk about what will be; they were thinking only of what could have been. As Alvito said: A win would have given our morale a big boost.         
	Till Sunday, the red and gold brigades defence and midfield had been the butt of all jokes. But in the glare of a near-empty Salt Lake Stadium it was these two departments which caught the eye.         
	Central defender Mehrajuddin Wadoo and midfielder Riston Rodrigues probably played the best match of the season so far, and Govin Singh looked to be gaining in confidence. With Nirmal Chetri and Sanju Pradhan scorching the right flank, East Bengal were pleasing to the eye from the outset.         
	JCT, probably too tired, playing as they were their second match inside three days on the artificial turf of the Salt Lake Stadium, just did not have a clue as to what was happening.         
	But the JCT back-four was in no mood to wilt. Sunil Kumar, rightly adjudged Man of the Match, was the pillar at the heart of the defence and Jaswinder was equally impressive.         
	One last thing. The artificial turf is creating problems for the players. Bhaichung and Yakubu did not look at ease on the surface and the other day Jose Ramirez Barreto was also complaining.         
	TEAMS         
	East Bengal: Abhra Mondal; Nirmal Chetri, Mehrajuddin Wadoo, Govin Singh, Saumik Dey (B Beikhokei 46); Sanju Pradhan (Harmanjot Khabra 63), Mehtab Hossain, Riston Rodrigues, Syed Rahim Nabi; Bhaichung Bhutia (Subhas Singh), Yusif Yakubu.         
	JCT: Karanjit Singh; Jaspal Singh, Sunil Kumar, Gurwinder Singh, Daljit Singh; Baldeep Singh, Jagpreet Singh, Penn Orji, Sakatar Singh (Jaswinder Singh 75); Balwant Singh, Baljit Sahni (Pawan Kumar 83).         
	Referee: PK Bose         
	MoM: Sunil Kumar (JCT)

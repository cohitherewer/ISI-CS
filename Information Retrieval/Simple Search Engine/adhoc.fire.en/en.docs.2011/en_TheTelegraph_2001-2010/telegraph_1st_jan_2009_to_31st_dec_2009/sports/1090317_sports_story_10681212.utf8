The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India face NZ test
                                                   India face NZ test
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India clash with New Zealand in a Super Six match of the World Cup at the North Sydney Oval on Tuesday. The match is tipped to be a grudge game of sorts as the Black Caps were handed a 40-run defeat by the Indians in the semi final of the last edition of the World Cup.         
	Four players from the current side  Haidee Tiffen, Aimee Mason, Sara McGlashan and Nicola Browne  featured in that match. India also beat New Zealand in a warm-up game in the build-up to the World Cup. India should also take heart from their stunning performance in the last match where they shocked champions Australia.         
	New Zealand, who won all their group games, lost their first Super Six game to England. A loss to India will all but kill their title hopes.         
	In the other match of the day England face the West Indies.

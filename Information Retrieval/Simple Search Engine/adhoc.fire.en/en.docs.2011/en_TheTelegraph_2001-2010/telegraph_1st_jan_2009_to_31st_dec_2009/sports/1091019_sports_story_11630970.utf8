The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wigan hold City 
                                                   Wigan hold City 
                      
	London: Martin Petrovs equaliser captured a 1-1 draw for 10-man Manchester City at Wigan on Sunday while Blackburn came from a goal behind to beat neighbour Burnley 3-2.         
	City had a chance to go third with a game in hand on the teams above in the Premier League standings by winning by two clear goals.         
	But they had to come from behind to take a point and stay in fifth, five points behind leader Manchester United and four behind Chelsea. Wigan dropped a place to 13th.         
	Despite seeing his side drop two points, City manager Mark Hughes showed he now has strength in depth to deal with injuries to key players, such as strikers Robinho and Craig Bellamy and defender Kolo Toure.         
	Thats what we had to address in the closed season, said Hughes, whose clubs wealthy owner, Sheik Mansour, has helped him strengthen the squad by spending more than 120 million.         
	The depth of the squad in terms of numbers and quality wasnt correct and we have done really well in that regard.         
	The home side went ahead in first half injury time, Charles NZogbia turned the ball home after Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given had failed to hold a shot from Hugo Rodallega.         
	City drew level in the second minute of the second half, however, when Petrov fired home with a well-placed left foot shot from the edge of the area from a low cross from Carlos Tevez.         
	The visitors were reduced to 10 men when Argentina defender Pablo Zabaleta was sent off in the 65th minute for his second yellow card.         
	In the other game, Robbie Blake gave Burnley a fifth minute lead at Ewood Park in the first meeting of the Northwest England rivals in a top-flight league match for 43 years.         
	But David Dunn equalised within four minutes, Franco di Santo made it 2-1 in the 21st and Pascal Chimbonda added the third just before half time. Chris Eagles scored a second for Burnley in second half injury time but Rovers held on for the three points.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sreesanth update is awaited
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sreesanth update is awaited
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Sreesanth                           
	Nagpur: Till late on Friday, the national selectors hadnt received an update on Sreesanths fitness.         
	The speedster had been picked for the two T20 Internationals and the first two ODIs against Sri Lanka, but couldnt play a single match after being hit by swine flu.         
	Sreesanths present state needs to be known by Krishnamachari Srikkanth and his colleagues as theyll be selecting the 15 for the last three ODIs, in Chennai, on Saturday.         
	The selectors wouldnt really like to bring Sreesanth back so soon, but a medical update is a must... One assumes Munaf Patel stands a good chance of making a comeback... Ashok Dinda could be considered, too, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	Should Yuvraj Singh have to be rested (on medical grounds), then Rohit Sharma, who has been among the runs in a big way, may make it.         
	No national selector, incidentally, was present in neighbouring Jamtha on Friday.         
	THE LAST THREE ODIs         
	Dec. 21: Cuttack; Dec. 24: Calcutta; Dec. 27: Delhi. The first two will be day-night matches.

	London: Umar Gul became the first bowler to take five wickets in a Twenty20 International as Pakistan scuttled New Zealand for 99 in a Super Eight stage match of the World Twenty20 at the Oval Saturday.               
	Pakistan won by six wickets with six overs and five balls to spare. Shahzaib Hasan was the top scorer with a 28-ball 35.               
	Gul produced a superb spell of fast bowling to take five for 6, while Abdul Razzaq vindicated the decision to recall him to the side in place of Sohail Tanvir by taking two for 17.         
	Scott Styris was New Zealands top scorer with just 22. Having won the toss Daniel Vettori, back in the side after recovering from a shoulder injury that kept him out of the first three games, decided to bat first.         
	His deputy Brendon McCullum smacked a quickfire 12, but was caught by Fawad Alam off the fourth ball of the second over, bowled by Abdul Razzaq. Aaron Redmond made just 5 before he was caught by Gul off Mohammad Aamer in the fourth over and, in the fifth, Razzaq trapped Martin Guptill leg before.         
	Shahid Afridi got rid of Jacob Oram, who miscued to Misbah-ul-Haq. Afridi then produced a stunning catch to dismiss Styris, who had tried to hit Gul out of the ground.         
	Peter McGlashan was aghast to be given out leg before, attempting to sweep Gul, leaving New Zealand in deep trouble on 73 for six in the 13th over.         
	Gul then ripped out Nathan McCullums leg stump in the 15th. In his final over, the 17th, he bowled James Franklin and then had Kyle Mills caught by Shahzaib Hasan with his next ball to set a new record in Twenty20 Internationals. New Zealand failed to complete their quota 20 overs when Vettori was run out with eight balls to spare.

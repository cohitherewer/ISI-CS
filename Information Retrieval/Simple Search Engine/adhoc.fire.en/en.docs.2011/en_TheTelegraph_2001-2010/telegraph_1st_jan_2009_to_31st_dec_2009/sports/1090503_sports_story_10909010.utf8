The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gayle to play today
                                                   Gayle to play today
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Chris Gayle will play the Kolkata Knight Riders match against the Kings XI Punjab in Port Elizabeth on Sunday. This was after the West Indies Cricket Board gave him permission to play one more match.         
	He was earlier slated to leave after their match against the Mumbai Indians on Friday.         
	That the Knight Riders team management had initiated a move to ensure Gayle played Sunday was reported by The Telegraph on Wednesday.         
	The West Indies Test series versus England begins on Wednesday. It means the West Indies captain will arrive in England just 48 hours before the first Test at Lords.

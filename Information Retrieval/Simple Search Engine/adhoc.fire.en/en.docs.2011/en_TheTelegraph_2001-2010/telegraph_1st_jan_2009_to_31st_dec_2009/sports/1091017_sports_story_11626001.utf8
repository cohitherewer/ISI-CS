The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL rivalry set to be renewed
                                                     IPL rivalry set to be renewed

	Bangalore: Royal Challengers Bangalore will have to play out of their skins for a win while Delhi DareDevils would look to shrug off their inconsistent form when the two sides lock horn in a potential high-voltage League B match of the Champions League Twenty20 here Saturday.         
	The Royal Challengers Bangalore, who were thumped by Victoria Bushrangers in the League B opener Friday, just cannot afford to lose as that would confirm their ouster.         
	The Bangalore squad looked well-balanced on paper with world-class batsmen and bowlers in their ranks but they have not been able to put their act together in the tournament so far, having won just one game out of four.         
	Any side which has Jacques Kallis, Rahul Dravid, Ross Taylor and Mark Boucher would be a formidable batting unit.         
	In the bowling front, Bangalore have the likes of Anil Kumble, Kallis, Dale Steyn, Roelof van der Merwe and Praveen Kumar.

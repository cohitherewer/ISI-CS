The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | More agony for Andrew Flintoff
                                                   More agony for Andrew Flintoff
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff has sustained a minor deep vein thrombosis in his right calf after undergoing knee surgery, the England and Wales Cricket Board said on Sunday.         
	Andrew Flintoff recently suffered a common complication of surgery, a minor deep vein thrombosis in his right calf, a statement said.         
	This will require a simple course of treatment and will not complicate his recovery from surgery.         
	Flintoff, 31, underwent surgery on his right knee the day after England regained the Ashes at the Oval last month.         
	He announced his retirement from Test before the Lords test after the latest in a series of career-threatening injuries and will now concentrate on the one-day game.         
	The most famous case of cricketing DVT was that of Steve Waugh back in 2001, who underwent a course of blood-thinning treatment after a clot in the torn calf muscle.

	Back in the ODI scheme of things, Rahul Dravid is happy, but isnt going over the moon. Thats not his style either.         
	Its nice to be back and Im looking forward to the cricket that is ahead... Of course, Ill be giving it my best shot, the former India captain, in his 14th year of international cricket, told The Telegraph.         
	Dravids last ODI had been in the 2007-08 home series against world champions Australia, on his in-laws turf  Nagpur.           LPS

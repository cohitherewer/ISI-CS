The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Alvito suggests an alternative
                                                   Alvito suggests an alternative
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The world is having sleepless nights over the economic meltdown and its effects but Alvito DCunha is not worried.         
	As the fear of a budget cut by the clubs looms before the next season gets under way, the East Bengal brand ambassador wants clubs to let the players look for alternatives.         
	If the clubs ask players to go for a pay cut, I think the players should also be allowed to talk to prospective clubs for a better deal. If he doesnt get any, then he can stay back.         
	Suppose a player who has a two-year contract, Alvito continues, is asked to go for a pay cut in his last year of the contract. I think the concerned club should allow the player to talk to other clubs. If he doesnt get a better package, then he can always stay back. This will also keep the relation between the club and the player cordial.         
	Alvito agreed that for a professional player, money is very important. I will be lying if I say money is not important. But, of course, a player weighs the pros and cons before making a move.         
	I feel at home in East Bengal and if at all I have to leave the club, I will see whether the new team will suit me, the coach they have and their playing style, the Goan, who is in the second year of his three-year contract, said.         
	Alvito said he is confident that East Bengal wont be relegated from the I-League this season. The red-and-gold brigade have 24 points from 20 matches and need to lose their remaining ties to be relegated. East Bengal play JCT at home on Friday and then host Dempo.         
	We should win our next two matches and finish in top-five. The scenario is not as bad as it was last season, when we had to battle hard to beat the drop, Alvito signed off.

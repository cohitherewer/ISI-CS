The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rory leads pack stalking Tiger
                                                     Rory leads pack stalking Tiger
            John Hopkins            Rory McIlroy                           
	They are getting younger and younger, arent they. Policemen? No, golfers. In 1997 Tiger Woods won the Masters when he had been a professional for eight months. As impressive as his 12-stroke victory was, there was admiration for the fact that he was only four months past his 21st birthday and 26 years younger than Tom Kite, who finished second.         
	When the Masters starts on Thursday there will be three talented players who are not yet 20. It would be rash to suggest that Rory McIlroy, Danny Lee or Ryo Ishikawa could win the first major championship of the year, but if golf has tectonic plates, the events in Georgia next week could come to be regarded as a sign of them shifting, a glimpse of the generation from which Woodss next challenger will emerge.         
	Leading the trio is McIlroy, 19. Whereas most golfers climb steadily up the world rankings, his ascent has been rapid. The young star from Holywood, near Belfast, the only teenager in the worlds top 50, took 18 months to break into that group and only three to move into the top 20.         
	Lee, 18, the South Korean-born New Zealander, became the youngest winner of the US Amateur last year and is the only one who has not turned professional. Yet do not describe his game as amateurish. The way Lee won the Johnnie Walker Classic in Perth, Australia, in February was impressive. Two behind after 54 holes, he had three birdies and a par between the 13th and 17th on the final round and birdied the 18th to snatch victory by one stroke, becoming the youngest winner of an event on the European Tour.         
	Then there is Ishikawa, 17, perhaps the most talented of all. Just eight months past his 15th birthday, the young man nicknamed Hanikami Oji  Bashful Prince  unabashedly won a professional tournament in Japan, his homeland. No one has broken into the worlds top 100 professionals at so tender an age. He is No.71.         
	If that were not enough to whet the appetite, there is more. Padraig Harrington won the Open at Royal Birkdale last July and followed that with victory one month later in the USPGA. The Irishman will drive down Magnolia Lane towards the wooden clubhouse at Augusta National next week knowing that he has a chance of winning a third straight major championship  a feat achieved only twice, by Ben Hogan in 1953 and Woods in 2000.           THE TIMES, LONDON

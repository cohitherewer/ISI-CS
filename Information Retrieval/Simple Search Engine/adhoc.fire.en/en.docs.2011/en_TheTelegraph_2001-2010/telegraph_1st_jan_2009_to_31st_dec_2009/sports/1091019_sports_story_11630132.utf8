The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Super Lajong run riot against Air India 
                                                   Super Lajong run riot against Air India 
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Shillong: Lajong FC defeated Air India 3-0 in their first home match of the ONGC I-League played at the JN Sports Complex Sunday.         
	In a match witnessed by a capacity 24,500 crowd, Air India suffered their first blow when Daniel Bidemi struck 45 seconds into the match.         
	Air India could hardly make an impression as the early goal gave Lajong the much-needed boost in front of home fans.         
	Seikhohau Tuboi added the second off a cross by captain Aibor Khongjee in the 28th minute and Lajong looked well on their way to a historic win.         
	However, after the change of ends, Air India took the field with purpose, looking for the goal that would bring them back into the match.         
	Air India were still looking for the, ultimately, elusive goal when James Gbilee scored the third in the 75th minute to seal the issue for the home team. He took off his jersey in wild jubilation, a move for which he was shown a yellow card.         
	Goalkeeper Gumpe Rime of Lajong did a fantastic job under the bar, thwarting Air India virtually every time the Mumbai side created chances.         
	Today our team did not play to its potential, especially after we conceded an early goal. Lapses in defence also cost us dearly. Also the ground condition was not favourable for our boys. The ground is hard and bouncy and big teams like Mohun Bagan, or any other team, will flatly refuse to play here, Air India coach Bimal Ghosh said.         
	For Lajong coach Stanley Rozario, it was a job well done: Im very pleased with the boys performance and also the crowd support.         
	Before their next home fixture, against Mohun Bagan on October 29, Stanley said his boys would have to do a lot of homework to put it across the Calcutta giants.         
	The Man of the Match award went to Nuwan--Gatpoh of Lajong. With Sundays win, Lajong have won two and lost two, collecting six points from four outings.         
	Lajong, the first team from the Northeast to make it to the top flight, are being seen as the flagbearers of the football in the hills. And the hopes, at least on paper, dont look unjustified.

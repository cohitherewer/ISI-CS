                                                   Mahela steers SL to win
                      
	A brace of three-wicket hauls from Muttiah Muralidharan and Ajantha Mendis, along with a half-century from Mahela Jayawardene led Sri Lanka to a comfortable five-wicket victory in their warm-up match against the West Indies in Pretoria.         
	According to cricinfo.com, after conceding 306 runs against Pakistan on Friday, Sri Lankas bowlers were more effective against a weak West Indian side. Dale Richards and Devon Smith scored half-centuries but, apart from Darren Sammy, no one else got to double figures. The West Indies had reached a respectable 121 for two before Muralidharan and Mendis went about dismantling the middle and lower-order.         
	While Muralidharan took 3 for 17 and Mendis claimed 3 for 31 as the West Indies were bowled out for 201 in the 46th over.         
	Sri Lanka began the chase shakily, with Tillakaratne Dilshan and Sanath Jayasuriya falling within the first 10 overs, but Jayawardene steadied the innings by scoring 67 before he was out hit wicket to Gavin Tonge.         
	There were also useful contributions from Kumar Sangakkara (35) and Thilina Kandamby (44) not out and Sri Lanka reached the target in the 48th over.         
	Meanwhile, in Benoni, in another warm-up match, Warriors put up a competitive total against Pakistan.         
	Batting first the South African side, who defeated New Zealand by two wickets in another warm-up game Friday, notched up 261 losing six wickets.         
	Opener Justin Kreusch fell four runs short of a century when he was bowled by Mohammed Amir. Kreusch along with his opening partner Michael Smith (42) put up 79 runs for the first wicket.         
	Wicketkeeper Arno Jacobs managed a 66-ball 54 that saw them reaching 261 in the allocated 50 overs. Pakistan, bowlers failed to repeat what they did against Sri Lanka and it was only Mohammed Amir, who managed to bag two wickets.         
	In reply, Pakistan lost openers  Imran Nazir and Kamran Akmal  within two runs before Shoaib Malik (88 batting) and Mohammed Yousuf (28) came to the rescue.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India eyeing positive start 
                                                   India eyeing positive start 
                      
	Ipoh: With an eye on the title, a resurgent India would be eyeing to start their Azlan Shah Cup campaign on a winning note when they take on Egypt in the opening match of the five-nation meet on Sunday.         
	India are on a high after a recent run of success at home and Down Under, but coach-in-charge Harendra Singh is in no mood to take Egypt lightly.         
	For the Asian teams the priority is the Asia Cup in May. This is just a testing ground, Harendra said.         
	Captain and drag-flicker Sandeep Singh will be expected to lead from the front and veteran Dilip Tirkey will be the key man in the defence. Young midfielder Ajitesh Roy is likely to be pressed as the third full back due to VR Raghunaths last minute withdrawal from the squad owing to a shoulder injury.

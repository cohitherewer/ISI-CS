                                                   Foreign clubs of little help: Bhutia
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Ace striker Bhaichung Bhutia Monday said that one should not be swayed by the big foreign clubs who are suddenly showing an interest in Indian football.         
	The India captain, who was in the capital to conduct a special skills session for children, organised by the Delhi International Football League, said the involvement of big European clubs would not necessarily help improve the standard of the game in the country.         
	Last week, three senior officials of Manchester United visited India and held talks with the All India Football Federation (AIFF) officials regarding the development of football at the grassroots level.         
	Although no official news was available from the AIFF, sources said the federation was keen on roping in the English Premier League (EPL) club in order to obtain technical support for the upcoming AIFF-Bharti academy in Goa.         
	Teams like Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal have been regularly going to Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore for the past 10 years, Bhaichung said.         
	There is nothing new in it. Their presence did not help football in any way there.         
	India has to be very careful in dealing with them, the Mohun Bagan striker warned.         
	People working on the Indian side in these joint ventures will have to be careful. We must see to it that we dont lose out in the process. Their (foreign clubs) marketing strategy is always very sharp, Bhaichung felt.         
	These tie-ups should help our football as well, it should be a win-win situation, he said.         
	Asked why national team colleague Sunil Chetri could not clear the trials for Coventry City, Bhaichung said Chetris agent was to blame for the East Bengal strikers failure.         
	Frankly, Sunils agent could have done better. I dont think it was fair to call Sunil to England only for six days.         
	Out of those six days, Bhaichung pointed out, Sunil could actually appear in trials for only two days. They called him when their matches were on. The Coventry first team had two off days. So what was the need for calling Sunil at that point of time, Bhaichung wondered.         
	I dont know why Coventry called him now in the middle of the season. They could have seen him in the summer, said Bhutia. Sunils agent should have advised him better.

                                                   Siddons: Were the underdogs
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nottingham: Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons spoke to the media on the eve of their match against India on Friday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On their chances of winning Saturdays game         
	Anyone can be dangerous anytime. We have some potential match-winners in our side. In any form of the game, we have been dangerous but the consistency hasnt really been there. We dont want to lose this game. We are the underdogs but are pretty relaxed about the game to put our best foot forward and put them (India) under pressure.         
	On the pressure of expectations         
	A bit. Weve got 140 or 150 million people who want us to do well. Every time we lose, they are in pain and every time we win, theyre happy. They mean a lot to us. We want to impress them and play good cricket. We look to go out there and give it a crack against India.         
	What is your expectation from Saturdays match?         
	One win and youre in second round: If we lose the game, weve got only one chance. We have nothing to lose but we would want to win the toss, get some runs and put them under pressure. Were going into the game tomorrow (Saturday) to win it.         
	If having an inexperienced team is a worry         
	Nearly all the youngsters in the team have been around for 15 months now. There have been plenty of opportunities for them to do well. Their inexperience isnt an excuse anymore. The boys are all ready to play.         
	How would you rate the teams performance in the warm-up games?         
	Against Australia, we didnt bowl that well. But we batted well and also did well against Sri Lanka. Were more consistent now.

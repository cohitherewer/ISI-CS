The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI, Wada meeting today
                                                                                                                                   BCCI, Wada meeting today
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The senior Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) officials are all set to meet Wada director general David Howman at the ICC headquarters in Dubai on Wednesday to discuss the much debated whereabouts clause.         
	We will be meeting Howman in Dubai tomorrow, board secretary N. Srinivasan told The Telegraph on Tuesday.         
	It is being speculated that the BCCI, in all likelihood, will suggest an alternative system to Wada, one where the onus of providing the whereabouts information of the players is with the respective parent body.         
	Meanwhile, speaking to the New Zealand media, Howman seemed to send across a strong message to the BCCI.         
	They (BCCI) have given a number of reasons and I am going to talk about those with them on Wednesday, Howman was quoted by a website.         
	India signed onto the code as one of the first countries. The Indian government is compliant, so if there is a part of India that is not compliant that is embarrassing for the (Indian) government, he added.

                                                   Alexs body in city
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The body of Alex Kattete, the George Telegraph footballer who passed away in Silchar early on Tuesday, was flown into the city on Wednesday.         
	George officials have started the process with the Ugandan Embassy so that the body can be flown home at the earliest. George official Anirban Datta said: His close friend Salim will accompany the body back to Uganda, he said.         
	Meanwhile, George players in Silchar are finding it difficult to come to terms with Alexs death. He was there with us during the 10-day residential camp in Shantiniketan. And he got along well with all the players. I am still at a loss. When you see someone dying in front of you, it becomes very scary, senior player Dipendu Biswas said from Silchar.

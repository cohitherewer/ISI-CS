                                                     Desperate teams ready for battle
                      JP Duminy and Brett Lee can make a big difference                       
	Pretoria: The Mumbai Indians may have ended their losing streak with a victory against the Royal Challengers Bangalore on Sunday, but the road to the semi-finals still remains tough as they prepare to take on an equally desperate Kings XI Punjab in a crucial Indian Premier League match here on Tuesday.         
	Just one point separates the two teams on the championship table with the Kings XI ahead, after 10 matches. In fact, the Punjab side had got the better of the Mumbai Indians when the two teams faced off the first time around in the event.         
	The Mumbai side are also through with 10 matches, having notched up four wins while suffering five losses, one match being a washout.         
	The Kings XI have been strengthened by the arrival of Australian pacer Brett Lee, who impressed with both bat and ball in the nail-biting win over the Deccan Chargers in his first IPL match this season.         
	Among the batsmen, Mahela Jayawardene scored a fifty against the Chargers and will have to play a key role in the middle order.         
	Kumar Sangakkara and captain Yuvraj Singh have been in good touch and it would be quite a task for the Mumbai bowlers to contain them if they get going.         
	The Sachin Tendulkar-led sides spirit has been lifted by the win over Royal Challengers Bangalore.         
	South African JP Duminys consistent scoring has taken care of the inconsistency of the opening pair of Sanath Jayasuriya and Tendulkar. But for the Mumbai Indians to do well, Tendulkar and Jayasuriya have to click at the top as Duminy may not be able to bail the side out in every match.         
	The bowling has been hit badly by Zaheer Khans absence. The pacer has been unavailable for the past three matches due to a shoulder injury and his absence has taken the bite out of the Mumbai sides attack.         
	Off-spinner Harbhajan Singhs inconsistent form hasnt helped the teams cause either.         
	Both the teams have lost some close encounters and it would be interesting to see how the two captains  Tendulkar and Yuvraj  respond if the match turns out to be a humdinger on Tuesday.         
	With the race to semi-finals getting tighter, Tuesdays contest is of immense significance as both the Mumbai Indians and the Kings XI Punjab are locked in an intense battle to be among the top-four.

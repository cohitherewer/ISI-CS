	Karachi: Former Pakistan players have described the national teams World Twenty20 triumph as a blessing for the game in the strife-torn country.         
	The following are excerpts (alphabetically)         
	Zaheer Abbas: I was not confident that this team could win the World Cup but the players picked up their performances remarkably well after the initial stages and the bowlers did a fantastic job. I am happy to see Shahid Afridi finally live up to the expectations.         
	Javed Miandad: Our players have shown how one can survive and learn to succeed in the most adverse circumstances. Our players have united to bring home a big victory for the Pakistani people.         
	RamIz Raja: I cant compare the 1992 World Cup win and this one because they came in different forms of the game, but I would definitely say this victory is more significant for its sheer timing and the circumstances it has come in.         
	Aamer Sohail: It will definitely help to reverse things. Sponsors were earlier reluctant to get involved in cricket and youngsters were moving to other sports due to problems surrounding the sport. But now, this victory will help bring back the sponsors and also reignite interest in the game among the youth.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Selectors hope Zaheer injury is not serious 
                                                     Selectors hope Zaheer injury is not serious 
    - Krishnamachari Srikkanth returns to South Africa today           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              Zaheer Khan                             
	Calcutta: Zaheer Khan, who is supposed to spearhead the Team India attack in next months World T20 in England, hasnt played for the Mumbai Indians after May 3, but the national selectors arent certain about the extent of his shoulder injury.         
	That, at least, was the bottomline till late on Friday.         
	Zaheers last appearance in the ongoing IPL, in South Africa, was against the Royal Challengers Bangalore in Johannesburg. Since then, the left-arm veterans franchise has featured in five matches, but he has been on the sidelines.         
	We assume the injury isnt serious, because we havent been asked to put anybody on stand-by... The captain (Mahendra Singh Dhoni, leading the Chennai Super Kings) is very much in South Africa, as is the India coach (Cape Town-based Gary Kirsten)...         
	If there was reason to worry big, somebody wouldve called one of us or the Board Lets hope its only a matter of time before Zaheer resumes playing, one of the five selectors told The Telegraph.         
	He forgot that colleague Yashpal Sharma is also in South Africa, wearing a Match Referees blazer in the IPL. But, then, T20 is played at a frenetic pace.         
	A clearer picture should emerge once chief selector Krishnamachari Srikkanth (who has a big role in the Super Kings franchise) rejoins the IPL bandwagon.         
	Srikkanth, who returned home before the May 4 selection committee meeting to pick the World T20 squad, is set to reach South Africa on Saturday.         
	If Zaheers injury is worse than imagined and a replacement has to be named, then a Lakshmipathy Balaji would be a strong contender.         
	The replacement has to be from the list of 30 probables.         
	Zaheer apart, the Team India XV has four new-ball bowlers  Irfan Pathan, Rudra Pratap Singh, Ishant Sharma and Praveen Kumar.         
	October, incidentally, will see the 30-year-old Zaheer complete nine years as an India cricketer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chargers eyeing revenge
                                                   Chargers eyeing revenge
                      
	Durban: The six-wicket defeat in their previous encounter against the Delhi DareDevils not only snapped the Deccan Chargers winning spree but also triggered a mid-event slump for the Hyderabad outfit. The Chargers would be gunning for revenge when the teams meet again in a potential Indian Premier League (IPL) humdinger here on Wednesday.         
	During the first half of the IPL, Adam Gilchrists men clearly looked the most high-flying squad before the DareDevils grounded them. The six-wicket defeat with eight balls, against the Delhi team, marked the start of a wretched stretch with three defeats on the trot. They lost to the Kings XI Punjab as well, sandwiched by the wins against the Mumbai Indians and the Rajasthan Royals, and with the race for the semi-final berths hotting up, Gilchrist and his men simply cannot afford to slip.         
	Meanwhile, if revenge would be on the Chargers agenda, the DareDevils would hope their winning streak to continue as they plan to cement their place at the top of the points table. Seven wins in nine outings speaks volumes of Delhis balance. With A.B. de Villiers and Tillekaratne Dilshan in the middle order, Delhis batting might is beyond question while Dirk Nannes, Ashish Nehra and Amit Mishras wicket-taking ability lends perfect balance to the side.

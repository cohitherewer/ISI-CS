    - French open 
  -  Effortless victories for Jankovic, Kuznetsova                             
	Paris: Serena Williams struggled to close out her match at a windy French Open on Tuesday, wasting eight match points before finally beating Klara Zakopalova of the Czech Republic 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 6-4.         
	The second-seeded Williams was broken twice during a windy second set, including when she was serving for the match at 5-4. At 5-3 with Zakopalova serving, she had five match points but couldnt close it out.         
	Zakopalova saved three more match points before holding to 5-3 in 0the third set, then broke Williams in the next game to get back on serve.         
	Williams completed her Serena Slam at the French Open in 2002, winning her fourth straight Grand Slam title. If she wins at Roland Garros this year, shell have won three majors in a row after victories at the U.S. Open and the Australian Open.         
	She reached the final at Wimbledon last year, but lost to big sister Venus in the final.         
	Third-seeded Jelena Jankovic and No. 7 Svetlana Kuznetsova also advanced in the womens tournament, while No. 4 Novak Djokovic and No. 5 Juan Martin del Potro made it through on the mens side.         
	Jankovic dominated her opponent before a 2-hour rain delay, and then did well enough after it to beat Petra Cetkovska of the Czech Republic 6-2, 6-3.         
	The former top-ranked Serb was leading 4-1 when the rain started at Roland Garros. She quickly closed out the first set when play resumed and continued to play well on Cetkovskas serve in the second but was broken twice on her own. I was controlling the points ... but then we had to stop because of the rain, Jankovic said. I felt a little bit slow after the rain delay.         
	While serving for the match, Jankovic again struggled and was forced to save break points before finally winning. The serve was all right. I didnt go for too much, said Jankovic, who added the balls were heavier than usual because of the wet weather. I just tried to have a high percentage.         
	Jankovic finished last season as the top-ranked player on the womens tour, but the Serb is still looking to win her first Grand Slam singles title after losing in the final of last years U.S. Open.         
	Kuznetsova defeated Claire Feuerstein of France 6-1, 6-4. The 2004 U.S. Open champion also dominated before the rain started falling, leading 5-1.         
	Djokovic advanced when Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador retired while trailing 6-3, 3-1 after injuring his left ankle. Lapentti hurt his ankle when coming to net at 5-2 in the first set. He called for a trainer but then continued playing.         
	The fourth-seeded Djokovic, who won his fourth career title on clay at this months Serbia Open, has reached the semi-finals at the French Open the last two years. He also won the 2008 Australian Open. Del Potro had little trouble in his opening match at Roland Garros, beating Michael Llodra of France 6-3, 6-3, 6-1.         
	The Argentina won four consecutive Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) titles last year, the first two on clay.         
	No. 27 Rainer Schuettler of Germany narrowly avoided a triple bagel after being shut out in the first two sets of a 0-6, 0-6, 4-6 loss to Marc Gicquel of France. On Friday, Schuettler lost to Robin Soderling 6-0, 6-0 at the ATP World Team Championship in Germany.         
	A double bagel is fine, said Schuettler, who reached the semifinals at last years Wimbledon. I had one last week. Its nothing new.         
	Gicquel was unapologetic about the thrashing.         
	I didnt come here to sympathize, said the Frenchman, who was trying to win the third set at love as well. If I tried to give him one or two games, then everything could be overturned against me.         
	No. 11 Gael Monfils of France also advanced, easily beating Bobby Reynolds of the United States 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 despite being hampered by a knee injury. (AP)

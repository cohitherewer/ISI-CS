The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kumar has the mind of a captain: Sanath
                                                     Kumar has the mind of a captain: Sanath
    - Ajantha Mendis is one of the great spinners, says the Senior-most pro             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sanath Jayasuriya at Trent Bridge on Wednesday. (Reuters)                                 
	Nottingham: Sanath Jayasuriya is less than three weeks short of his 40th birthday, but age isnt weighing him down.         
	If anything, the oldest cricketer from a Test-playing nation (Canadas Sunil Dhaniram is already 40-plus) showed yet again, against the West Indies on Wednesday, that hes as hungry as ever.         
	Jayasuriya interacted with the media after his mind-blowing 81 (off only 47 balls). Afterwards, he briefly spoke to The Telegraph separately.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Age not being a factor for him         
	(Laughs) You dont have to worry about age as long as youre playing well and performing... Weve got good physios and trainers as part of the support staff.         
	Realisation that Wednesday was his day         
	When I played the cover drive in the second over... Was a perfect shot... If the ball is in my area or my zone, then Ill hit it hard.         
	Going after Fidel Edwards         
	Hes their key bowler, but had an off day.         
	Seeming to enjoy T20         
	I am, yes... It suits my natural game, which is to play attacking cricket... Of course, one must be fit to keep pace with the younger players.         
	Whether he would advise his Mumbai Indians captain Sachin Tendulkar to take back his retirement from T20 Internationals         
	Its not for me to advise Sachin.         
	Missing out on a hundred         
	Definitely a bit disappointing, but I was looking at more runs for Sri Lanka not so much at a possible hundred... But, yes, when a batsman is set he should bat for the full 20 overs...         
	Tillekaratne Dilshan as an opening partner         
	Oh, hes playing really well... I didnt have to do anything different, just play my natural game. I cant improvise like him, though.         
	Whether his 124-run partnership (12.3 overs only) with Dilshan reminded him of his sensational association with Romesh Kaluwitharana in the mid-Nineties         
	Well, yes... One always remembers those days... One looks to continue batting in the same manner.         
	Impact made by Ajantha Mendis         
	There are times when even we cant read him at nets... Hes one of the great spinners.         
	Spinners striking it rich in the World T20         
	I think the success of our spinners is due to the variations they possess... Not that the wickets have been turning a lot.         
	Opening the bowling against the West Indies         
	We try to do different things... The call was the captains.         
	The IPL experience         
	Those who played have gained... Unfortunately, the Mumbai Indians didnt do well... The top-order didnt perform consistently and well have to improve in the next edition.         
	Looking ahead to the Super Eight matches         
	Well be taking it match by match... For now, our focus is on Friday, when we face Pakistan (at Lords)... We arent looking too far ahead... We were in a tough group, but showed character by winning both the qualifying matches.         
	Finally, on Sri Lankas new captain, Kumar Sangakkara         
	Kumars good... He has the mind of a captain.

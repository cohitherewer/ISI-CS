The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Top spot is wide open: Dravid
                                                   Top spot is wide open: Dravid
                      
	London: The one-team domination in Test cricket has ended with Australias decline, feels Rahul Dravid, who foresees the No. 1 spot changing hands every few months between India, Sri Lanka and South Africa.         
	I dont think youll see one team dominating like Australia did, at least not in the immediate future, Dravid said.         
	There are three or four teams that are evenly matched and you could see the No. 1 spot change hands a few times in the next couple of years, Dravid added.         
	Speaking on Team Indias future, he said: If we can keep a core group of fast bowlers fit enough to support the spinners then we have good a chance. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal seal berth in next round
                                                   Bengal seal berth in next round
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal notched up their third consecutive victory in the East Zone National One-dayers for the Vijay Hazare Trophy at the Eden on Thursday as they beat Tripura by 91 runs. The win guaranteed Bengal a place in the next round of the tournament.         
	Tripura kept losing wickets at regular intervals, chasing the 250-run target. An under pressure Ashok Dinda, and Ranadeb Bose, bowled a tight line and swung the ball.         
	Dinda struck off successive balls, removing Sourabh Dubey and Abhijit Dey, in his second over. The visitors never recovered from the early setback. Nishit Shetty (40) and Swapan Das (41) tried in vain as they failed to maintain the required run rate.         
	They were eventually bundled out for 158 in 42.3 overs, which gave Bengal a bonus point. Ranadeb, bagged three wickets for 17, while. Manoj Tiwary and Iresh Saxena chipped in with two each.         
	Bengal won the toss and decided to bat first. Sreevats Goswami, who came into the playing XI in place of Sourav Ganguly, joined forces with Wriddhiman Saha (43) to stitch together a 46-run partnership.         
	But a slow run rate during the Powerplays found them 50-60 runs short of what could have been an intimidating total. They managed only 81 runs in the first 20 overs at the rate of 4.         
	Sreevats, who got three lives, went on to score 74 (95 balls), hitting three fours and one six. Manoj Tiwary, once again, failed to build on his good start and fell at 55.         
	The rest of the batting was pretty ordinary and losing nine wickets for 249 should set the alarm bells ringing in the Bengal dressing room. Dutta of Orissa grabbed four wickets for 43 runs.         
	Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla injured his back and left the field during the Orissa innings.

                                                     Roger Binny starts with double speak
  - On his first day in office, Bengal coach says he prefers two captains         A STAFF REPORTER            Bengal coach Roger Binny with Laxmi Ratan Shukla at the Eden on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Newly-appointed Bengal coach Roger Binny fuelled a debate on his very first day in office by saying he would prefer two captains.         
	Laxmi Ratan Shukla had led Bengal in the Ranji and the Vijay Hazare trophies last season, but is under pressure this time.         
	I would prefer two captains Ideally there should be two captains, Binny said after a two-hour practice session at the Pankaj Gupta Indoor Centre on Wednesday.         
	You require all-rounders in one-dayers, so its better to have two captains.         
	Personally, I feel in one-dayers a batting all-rounder proves to be a better captain Again, in the longer version, a captain who bowls wont be ideal, as he wouldnt always know when to bring himself on         
	But there are also guys who can fit into both sides Take the example of Mahendra Singh Dhoni What do you do in such circumstances? was his poser.         
	A member of the 1983 World Cup-winning side, Binny said his immediate task was to get the team together.         
	 The target right now is to get the team together. Besides bowling and batting, fielding and fitness will be important.         
	With four players unavailable because of Corporate Trophy commitments we will be dividing the rest into three batches of 12 each and focus on specific areas There will be weight training for the pacers but for batsmen it will be different, he explained.         
	Binny said he had spoken to former coach Bharat Arun and former consultant Mohinder Amarnath before taking charge. He also plans to have a session with former India captain Sourav Ganguly.         
	Binny said he had watched Bengals quarter final against Tamil Nadu last season after Shukla and Co. were promoted to the Elite division.         
	I feel our batsmen played one-day shots and committed hara-kiri... They seemed to be in a hurry and played too many shots. I think thats one thing we can improve upon.         
	Were going to address the problem areas. But theres no doubt about the talent pool here, he said.         
	Binny was of the opinion that the return of the Indian Cricket League players would turn out to be positive for the side.         
	The return of the ICL players will be positive for us... The experienced players will be back. They will have to fight their way back and that should be a good challenge for them. Weve a fixed team but the competition will serve the side well, he said.         
	Binny, however, felt that Bengal might be short on match practice in the lead up to the Ranji Trophy.         
	It would have been good had we played in the Buchi Babu and KSCA tournaments Importantly, there are no rains in those parts We will be short on match practice but will have to do with whatever we have, he remarked.         
	He, however, is not looking at big scores from the players in the preparatory tournaments.         
	More than the score, how much time a batsman spends in the middle will be of utmost importance         
	Bengal begin their season with the Moin-ud-Dowla Gold Cup in Hyderabad from September 10-22.         
	Meanwhile, Avishek Jhunjhunwala, who was admitted to a hospital with fever, will be discharged on Thursday. He is expected tpo join practice next week.

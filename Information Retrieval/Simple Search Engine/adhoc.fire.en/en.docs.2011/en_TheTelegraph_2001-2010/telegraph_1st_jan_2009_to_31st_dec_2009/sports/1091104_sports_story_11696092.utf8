The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mumbai missed out: Suresh Kalmadi 
                                                                                                                                   Mumbai missed out: Suresh Kalmadi 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Suresh Kalmadi Tuesday revealed that the 2010 Commonwealth Games were initially proposed to be held in Mumbai but a delay in decision making meant the economic capital of the country lost a chance to improve its infrastructure.         
	The first proposal was for the Games to be brought to Mumbai but the cabinet committee of the day (2003) did not take any decision and thus it came to Delhi, Kalmadi told reporters on the sidelines of a function here.         
	There was a lack of facilities in Mumbai... Financially, it would not have been viable for the government. But it would have been great if the Games had been in Mumbai, he said.         
	The 2010 Games are to be held in Delhi from October 3 to 14.

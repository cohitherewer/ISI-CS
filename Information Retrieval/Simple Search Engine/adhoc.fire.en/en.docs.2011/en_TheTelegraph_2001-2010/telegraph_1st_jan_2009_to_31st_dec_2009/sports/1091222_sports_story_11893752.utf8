                                                                                                                       7                                      Dont run after captaincy, says Miandad
                      
	Karachi: With captaincy debate continuing to rage in Pakistan cricket, former skipper Javed Miandad has called on the members of the national team to focus on their performance instead of running after captaincy.         
	Miandad said if every player nurtured the ambition of becoming the national team captain then things would become difficult in the dressing room. When I played I just thought about getting an opportunity to play for the country and to perform well. If you deserve the captaincy you will eventually get it, so why run after it, Miandad said.         
	The captaincy issue continues to be a hot topic in Pakistan cricket after Mohammed Yousuf led the country against New Zealand.(PTI)

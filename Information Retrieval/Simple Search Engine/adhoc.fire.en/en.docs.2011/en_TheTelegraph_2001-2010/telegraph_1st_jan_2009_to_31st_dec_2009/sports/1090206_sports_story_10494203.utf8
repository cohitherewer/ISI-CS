	Calcutta: Brett Lee was not included in Australias Test side while uncapped Phillip Hughes of New South Wales was chosen to replace the retired Matthew Hayden in Australias Test side Thursday, according to information forwarded by Cricket Australia.    
	Announcing the 14-man squad for the tour of South Africa, national selection panel chairman Andrew Hilditch said: It is one of the most exciting things I have had the pleasure of doing since being a selector in naming Phillip Hughes in the Test touring squad. Phillip has been given the fairly daunting task of filling the shoes of one of Australias greatest batsmen (Matthew Hayden). Phillip is a young man who has had an outstanding debut in first-class cricket for New South Wales.    
	THE SQUAD    
	Ricky Ponting (captain), Michael Clarke (vice-captain), Doug Bollinger, Brad Haddin (wicketkeeper), Nathan Hauritz, Ben Hilfenhaus, Phillip Hughes, Michael Hussey, Mitchell Johnson, Simon Katich, Andrew McDonald, Bryce McGain, Marcus North and Peter Siddle.          
	Melbourne: Spin legend Shane Warne feels being dropped from the Australian squad for their tour of South Africa could prove a blessing in disguise for Andrew Symonds who can use this break to revive his sagging career. Ruling Andrew Symonds out of the South Africa tour is the best thing that could happen, Warne said.        
	Calcutta: New Zealand have named an unchanged 12-member team for the second ODI against Australia at Melbourne Friday, with the 12th man to be confirmed prior to start of play.    
	Team    
	Brendon McCullum, Martin Guptill, Peter Fulton, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Neil Broom, Kyle Mills, Daniel Vettori (Capt.), Tim Southee, Jeetan Patel, Iain OBrien, Craig Cumming.        
	Karachi: National team players and Pakistan Cricket Board officials would now have to seek permission from the board before making any public statement under a new PCB policy formulated by chairman Ejaz Butt.        
	Bangkok: Rahil Gangjee blasted a sizzling six-under 65 to lie tied third after the opening round of the season-opening $300,000 Asian Tour International here Thursday. Compatriot Gaganjeet Bhullar was just one stroke behind at tied fifth, while Gaurav Ghei carded two-under 69 to lie tied 29th. Digvijay Singh was further down at 57th with a card of 71. C Muniyappa was at tied 81st after his level-par round, while Amardeep Johl and Anirban Lahiri carded identical 74s to lie tied 118th.

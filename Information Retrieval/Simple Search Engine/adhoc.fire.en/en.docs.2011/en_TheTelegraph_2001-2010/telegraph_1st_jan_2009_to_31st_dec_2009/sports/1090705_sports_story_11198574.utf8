	Woods hits four-under, leads pack  
	 Bethesda (Maryland): Tiger Woods played the role of inhospitable host by soaring to the top of the leaderboard after the second round of the AT amp;T National on Friday.  
	The world No.1 fired a four-under par 66 to finish with 10-under 130, one stroke ahead of Australian Rod Pampling (64). First round leader and holder Anthony Kim followed his course record 62 on Thursday with a topsy-turvy 70 to slide back into third place, two strokes off the pace. Vijai Singh shot a two-under par 68 to trail by eight.        
	Tour de France  
	 Monaco: Seven-time champion Lance Armstrong began his comeback at the Tour de France on Saturday by briefly taking the lead in the first-stage time trial in Monaco.  
	Armstrong took an early lead with a time of 20 minutes, 13 seconds for the 15.5-kilometre ride along winding and hilly roads in the Mediterranean principality. But only 15 riders later, Germanys Tony Martin outpaced Armstrong by seven seconds. Then Armstrongs Astana teammate Levi Leipheimer took the provisional lead by clocking 20:03.      
	Dry day  
	 Singapore: India drew a blank on the fifth day and failed to add to their tally at the inaugural Asian Youth Games Saturday. Indians competed in swimming, shooting and table tennis Saturday without any success. The medals haul so far is five gold, three silver and two bronze.  
	Polo match  
	 New Delhi: In a first of its kind, India will take on the United States in a polo match at the National Mall in Washington DC in June next year. The event, seen as an initiative to strengthen sport and cultural ties between the two countries, was formally announced Saturday on the occasion of the United States 233rd Independence Day.  
	Madrid plan  
	Madrid: Real Madrid need to sign two more players and off-load about 10 to round off their summer transfer dealings, club president Florentino Perez has said.   
	Real have already sold Javier Saviola, and the Dutch contingent of Ruud van Nistelrooy, Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder, Rafael van der Vaart, Royston Drenthe and Klaas Jan Huntelaar are all reportedly on the market.

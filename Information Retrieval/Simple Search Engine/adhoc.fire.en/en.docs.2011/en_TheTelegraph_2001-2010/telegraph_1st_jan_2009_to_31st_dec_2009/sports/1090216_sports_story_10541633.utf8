The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sporting edge past Churchill 
                                                   Sporting edge past Churchill 
                      
	Margao: Chandrashekar Chintas solitary goal helped Sporting Clube De Goa beat Churchill Brothers 1-0 in a 15th round match of the ONGC I-League at the Nehru stadium here on Sunday and kept their title hopes alive.         
	Sporting took the lead in the sixth minute of the match when Chinta took full advantage of a defensive lapse from Thokchom Naoba Singh and leapt over the defender to head the ball past the outstretched hands of Churchill custodian Arindam Bhattacharya.         
	Sporting were a transformed side today under new coach Clifford Chukwuma who replaced Vishwas Gaoncar.         
	Sporting midfield co-ordinated well with Bibiano Fernandes leading the charge as they kept their forwards busy with short passes and never really felt the absence of their regular midfielder Wilton Gomes and Harmonjit Khabra.         
	The defence also put up a stout display with Mathew Gonsalves not allowing dangerman Odafe Okolie any liberty to operate inside the box.         
	With the victory, Sporting remained on the second spot of the points table with 31 points from 15 matches, two behind leaders Mohun Bagan. Churchill remained on the third spot with 27.

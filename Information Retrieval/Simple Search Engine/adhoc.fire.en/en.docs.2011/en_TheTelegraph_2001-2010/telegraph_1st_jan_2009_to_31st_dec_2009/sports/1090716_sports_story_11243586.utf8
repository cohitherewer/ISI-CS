                                                   FLINTOFF FACTBOX
                      
	EARLY days         
	Flintoff represented England for the first time at Test level against South Africa in Nottingham, England in July 1998.         
	CAREER HIGHS         
	Following an inconsistent opening to his international career, he knocked his highest career Test score of 167 against the West Indies at Edgbaston in July 2004 and recorded career best bowling figures of five for 58 in subsequent tour in Antigua.         
	He scored 402 runs and took 24 wickets to inspire England as they regained the Ashes for the first time in 18 years with a 2-1 series victory over Australia in September 2005. He was named man of the series.         
	Flintoff won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year for 2005 and ICC player of the year as well as being named Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in April 2006.         
	He was awarded an MBE in 2006.         
	INJURIES         
	Flintoff underwent surgery in 2005 and 2006, the latter forcing him to miss the second half of the English season.         
	A fourth operation on his ankle in late 2007 removed extra bone and bone fragments which ruled him out until Test matches against South Africa in July 2008 when he became the 12th England player to take 200 Test wickets.         
	2009...         
	Flintoff flew home from the Caribbean for treatment on a torn hip muscle and missed the fifth and final Test against the West Indies. He had already missed the fourth Test. Flintoff hurt his right hip in the drawn third Test in Antigua but continued to bowl even though teammates said he was in pain.         
	England ended their ragged tour of the West Indies on a high in April when a Flintoff hattrick helped them beat the hosts by 26 runs to win the one-day series 3-2.         
	Flintoff again suffered injury twisting his right knee during the drawn first Ashes Test against Australia in Cardiff. However, England are optimistic that he will be fit for the second Ashes Test starting at Lords on Thursday.

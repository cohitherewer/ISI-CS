The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | You can have only one captain, says Gayle
                                                     You can have only one captain, says Gayle
    - Sourav declines to comment on Buchanan removal             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mickey Arthur                                 
	London: On the eve of the World T20 semi-final against Sri Lanka, Chris Gayle wasnt at all prepared for a question on John Buchanan.         
	Has John been removed by the (Kolkata) Knight Riders? Oh, I didnt know that... was the West Indies captains reply, at the Oval, on Thursday afternoon.         
	One learns different things from different people... John had some good points and I wouldnt say it was a bad case (of working with the Knights erstwhile head of cricket operations), Gayle said in his matter of fact manner.         
	When did they make the announcement? Wholl be succeeding John? Gayle asked The Telegraph. He spent the next couple of minutes scrolling a BlackBerry and reading every word of the Knights statement.         
	Having been identified as one of the captains within the leadership group, what did he make of Buchanans multiple captains theory?         
	It wasnt implemented... Thats not for me... You can only have one man running the show... I wouldnt go for multiple leaders or captains, Gayle insisted.         
	[Sourav Ganguly, who was removed as the Knights captain at Buchanans behest, this year, declined to comment. Right now, I have no reaction to give.]         
	Owing to an injury, Gayle couldnt turn out for the Knights in the IPLs inaugural edition, last year. In season No.2, because of commitments with the West Indies, Gayle played just a handful of matches.         
	The Knights finished last, slipping from the sixth to the eighth position.         
	Meanwhile, speaking exclusively on the eve of Buchanans removal, South Africas coach Mickey Arthur, had said: I know its not possible now, but Id love to coach a franchise such as the Knights... Its fan base is awesome...         
	Mickey is contracted to Cricket South Africa till 2012.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sunderland test for Chelsea
                                                   Sunderland test for Chelsea
                      
	London: Chelsea experienced a stuttering start to their Premier League campaign Saturday, and it took Didier Drogbas stoppage-time goal for the Blues to clinch a 2-1 win over Hull.         
	Chelseas new diamond midfield formation will come under scrutiny again Tuesday against Sunderland.         
	It feels different not to play with wingers and to play with two strikers, midfielder Michael Ballack said. In a diamond, your attention is more on controlling the play, you have more ball in midfield and one more man there as well.         
	So you gain a small advantage through the centre, but theres more hard work for the four midfielders because they have a lot of work to do on and off the ball in this system.         
	Meanwhile, Manchester United, who opened with a 1-0 win over Birmingham, face another newly-promoted team Wednesday when the defending champions travel to Burnley.         
	Wednesdays match will be a tough one, United goalkeeper Ben Foster said. Burnley are going to be really up for it and their fans will give them an extra 20 per cent (boost).         
	Weve got to go there, be professional, do what we did against Birmingham and hopefully keep another clean sheet.         
	Liverpool will look to correct their deficiencies and overcome the lethargy shown in their opening-round loss at Tottenham when the Reds host Stoke on Wednesday.         
	Having lost 1-2 to Spurs on Sunday, Liverpool are already playing catch-up with title rivals Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea after they all enjoyed winning starts.         
	Birmingham host Portsmouth on Wednesday, when Spurs will be hoping to make it two wins out of two at Hull. (AP)

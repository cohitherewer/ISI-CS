            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Defending champions Dempo failed to overcome a depleted but determined Air India and were held to a 0-0 draw in the I-League match at the Cooperage here on Friday.         
	Dempo failed to break the shackles even after Air India were reduced to 10 men following the red card to Bijoy Basfore, who received his marching orders after his second booking in the 62nd minute.

  - Tsonga cruises into Round II Venus survives a scare             Svetlana Kuznetsova hits a return to Julia Goerges at Flushing Meadows on Tuesday. (Reuters)                           
	New York: Two-time Grand Slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova advanced to the second round of the US Open, beating Julia Goerges of Germany 6-3, 6-2 Tuesday.         
	Kuznetsova, the 2004 champion and this years French Open champion, won nine of 11 games at 3-3 in the first set. Also, in the first round Tuesday, seventh seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France easily overcame 18-year-old Chase Buchanan of the US 6-0, 6-2, 6-1.         
	As the second day action got underway at Flushing Meadows, the talk was still about the awesome parent power that ruled the hardcourts Monday as champion Roger Federer and Kim Clijsters put their young upstart opponents firmly in their places to storm into the second round.         
	Federer, seeking his third successive major following his triumphs at the French Open and Wimbledon, and Clijsters were both playing their first Grand Slam tournament following the births of their respective children.         
	For Clijsters, it marked her first major since the 2007 Australian Open but it seemed difficult to believe she had been away for more than two years as she pulverised 21-year-old Ukrainian Viktoriya Kutuzova 6-1, 6-1 in 58 minutes.         
	New father Federer, who celebrated the arrival of twin daughters five weeks ago, took an 88-minute break from nappy changing duties to down American debutant Devin Britton 6-1, 6-3, 7-5.         
	Clijsters and Federer were just two of five US Open champions gracing the Arthur Ashe Stadium on a blockbuster opening day of the hardcourt major.         
	Womens champion Serena Williams walloped fellow American Alexa Glatch 6-4, 6-1 but elder sister Venus, the 2000 and 2001 winner, was just three points from suffering her earliest-ever defeat at the Open before the hollering crowd carried her to a 6-7, 7-5, 6-3 win over Russian Vera Dushevina.         
	I had a lot of help from the fans. I felt so much energy from everyone when I was serving to stay in the match in the second set. It feels good to play at home, Venus, who needed a medical timeout to treat a sore left knee, told the crowd.         
	Andy Roddick, being tipped to win a second title here following his gut-wrenching five-set loss to Federer in the Wimbledon final, spared the fans another roller coaster of emotions as he swept past Germanys Bjorn Phau 6-1, 6-4, 6-2.         
	Clijsters showed she could be challenging for the top prize despite playing in only her third event this year.         
	Crediting part of her fitness to chasing around after (18-month-old daughter) Jada, she gave the hapless Kutuzova the run around with her solid groundstrokes to set up a re-match with Frenchwoman Marion Bartoli, whom she beat in her comeback match at Cincinnati earlier this month.         
	(I was) a little more nervous than usual, Clijsters, dressed for the occasion in a red, white and blue outfit, said after returning to Flushing Meadows for the first time since winning her only Grand Slam title here in 2005.         
	Driving up here this morning, just seeing the court, the memories came back. Its a very special court to me and I really enjoyed it.         
	Those sentiments were shared by Federer, who is not only looking to extend his record Grand Slam haul to 16 but is also eager to match Bill Tildens 1920s feat of winning six US championships in a row.         
	Thats what Im here for, trying to equal Bill Tildens record, said Federer.         
	You can set different types of goals. Mine are at a very, very high level.         
	Ai Sugiyamas record 62nd consecutive appearance in a Grand Slam ended with a 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 defeat by Australian 15th seed Samantha Stosur. Former world No.1s Amelie Mauresmo and Lleyton Hewitt also progressed.

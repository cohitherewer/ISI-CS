                                                   Fifa mulling far-reaching changes
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Fifa is actively considering a proposal to allow a fourth substitute during extra-time in a match driven by the increasing concern for the physical condition of the players.         
	The International Football Association Board (IFAB) will discuss the fourth substitute issue and a set of other proposals on February 28 at Belfast in a bid to make some far-reaching changes in the laws of the game.         
	The IFAB is the law-making body of football. It comprises the four British associations and four representatives from Fifa, with a three-quarters majority needed to change any law.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph on Tuesday, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) general secretary Alberto Colaco confirmed the development.         
	Yes, there is a proposal to increase the number of substitutes when a match goes to extra time.         
	According to Colaco, the Fifa is becoming increasingly concerned about dehydration and the health of the footballers.         
	During the Beijing Olympics final, the teams were officially allowed to take a break for a couple of minutes after 30 minutes because of excessive heat. The health of the players is the prime concern of Fifa these days. The Fifa medical and research board is also looking into these things.         
	The IFAB may also introduce an experimental yellow card rule on the lines of rugby and ice hockey. It will be called a sin-bin yellow card and the player who receives it will have to sit out for a period of five to 10 minutes.         
	The IFAB will also consider a clarification on the wording of the off-side law, especially after what happened during Euro 2008 when referee Peter Frojdfeldt was criticised for allowing a goal scored by Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy.         
	Some felt Nistelrooy was off-side since Italy defender Christian Panucci was off the pitch.         
	The clarification seeks to establish that even if the defender leaves the field, he is still active as far as off-side is concerned.

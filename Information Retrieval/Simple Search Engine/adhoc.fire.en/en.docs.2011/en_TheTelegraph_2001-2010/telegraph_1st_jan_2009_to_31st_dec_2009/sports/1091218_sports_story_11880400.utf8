The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Eden tipped to host Test 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Eden tipped to host Test 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: After more than two years, it remains to be seen whether Calcutta gets a chance to host a Test, if the Board of Control for Cricket In India (BCCI) strictly follows its rotation policy. If sources in the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) are to be believed, the chances of Eden Gardens hosting one of the two Test matches against South Africa look really bright.         
	The last time the Eden hosted a Test was against Pakistan from November 30 to December 4, 2007. The match ended in a draw.         
	We are more than hopeful that we will be getting a Test match when South Africa tour India. If one checks the rotation policy, some of the centres have hosted two Test matches during the last two years since we hosted Pakistan, said CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey, who is also a member of the BCCIs tours, programmes and fixtures committee. Dey is currently in Mumbai to attend the working committee meeting on Friday.         
	With Nagpur hosting an out-of-turn ODI (after the second ODI vs Sri Lanka in Vizag was shifted), the CAB is banking on BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi to turn the tide in their favour. Modi is also convenor of the tours, programmes and fixtures committee and was instrumental in CAB getting to host the fourth ODI versus Sri Lanka on December 24.         
	After the Eden Test in 2007, there have been 12 Test matches played at home. Chennai, Ahmedabad, Mohali, Kanpur have each hosted two Test matches, while Bangalore, Nagpur, Delhi and Mumbai have hosted a Test each.         
	However, a section within the BCCI wants to allot a match to Hyderabad which last hosted a Test in 1988 when New Zealand toured India.

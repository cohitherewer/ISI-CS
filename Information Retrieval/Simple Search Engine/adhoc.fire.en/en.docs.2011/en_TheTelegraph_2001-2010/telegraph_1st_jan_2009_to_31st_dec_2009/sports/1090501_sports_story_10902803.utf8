The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sweating it out on an optional day
                                                   Sweating it out on an optional day
                      
	For the Kolkata Knight Riders, Thursdays nets in East London, soon after arriving from Durban, had been optional. Senior-most pro Sourav Ganguly, though, chose to have a hit.         
	I just wanted to have a session... Were now in a position where weve got to start winning and then keep the momentum going, Sourav told The Telegraph.         
	Asked whether making the semi-finals was a realistic hope, Sourav replied: Can be done, but its difficult to say it will be... Actually, no rocket science is involved... We just need to start winning... We may win all the remaining eight (league) matches or five or none at all...         
	According to Sourav, those doing the right things at the right time always stand a better chance of succeeding. Its a general observation, but holds true, he pointed out.         
	Talking of the mood within, Sourav said: Its never easy when the teams losing, but theres much cricket left to be played...         
	The Knights have no more than three points from six matches and sit at the bottom of the eight-team table.           LPS

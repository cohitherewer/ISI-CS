                                                   Bagan could have avoided spat with Bhutia: Houghton
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: National coach Bob Houghton came out in support of Bhaichung Bhutia yet again Thursday saying it was a non-issue which could have been ignored easily.         
	It is a pity that the Mohun Bagan officials are involved in a slanging match with the national team captain. In this issue, if Mohun Bagan and Bhaichung are on the losing side, then Indian football is the biggest loser. Mohun Bagan look ridiculous here. They could have avoided making it a nuclear explosion, he said.         
	Bhaichung is an asset for the country. Had it been the case with the national team, we would have just laughed over it and allowed him to go. No way would I have taken it to the AIFF executive committee, he said. Houghton even took a dig at East Bengal for changing their coach thrice in the last season.

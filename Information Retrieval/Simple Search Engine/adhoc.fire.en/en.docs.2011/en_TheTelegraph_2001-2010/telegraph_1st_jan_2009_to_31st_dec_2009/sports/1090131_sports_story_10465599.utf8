                                                     Serena looks to enter elite club
            Mark Hodgkinson            Serena Williams                            
	Melbourne: If Serena Williams beats Russias Dinara Safina, she will gain a fourth Australian Open trophy, adding to the titles she won in 2003, 2005, 2007, and in doing so take her overall total for the Grand Slams to double figures.         
	Victory under the show-business lights of the Rod Laver Arena would also provide the further reward of her regaining top ranking.         
	The Californian already believes that she is the rightful world No.1, that there is no female who can hit a tennis ball as well as she can, and the computer could soon come round to her way of thinking, after a final that is a straight fight to go to the top of the power list.         
	What is it about Williams and odd-numbered seasons in Melbourne? Maybe we should start to call them Serena Years.         
	Williams could become the seventh woman to reach double figures for Slam singles titles, joining Margaret Court, Steffi Graf, Helen Wills Moody, Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert and Billie Jean King inside the red rope of the VIP room.         
	I would be part of an elite club, Williams said.         
	Safina bears a strong facial resemblance to her elder brother, Marat Safin, shares his emotional, racket-unfriendly manner on the court and his self-deprecating take on life off the court. She jokingly suggested during the fortnight that it can sometimes feel as though she is playing against me, my shadow, myself, everything  if maybe one day I will play only against my opponent, this will be the perfect day.         
	And if Safina becomes the champion that would, according to the on-site statisticians, make her and Marat, the 2005 mens winner in Australia, the first brother and sister to score Grand Slam singles titles.         
	Whatever happens Saturday, Serbias Jelena Jankovic is going to lose the lead ranking. Victory for Safina would also mark the first time in history that a brother and sister have been the world No.1 on their respective tours. If scientists ever look into the genetic make-up of tennis players, the first people they should approach with their cotton swabs are the Safin family. It would be amazing to have the same trophy as my brother, she said.         
	But do not expect Marat to be in her entourage  when she made her first appearance in a Slam final, finishing as the runner-up to Serbian Ana Ivanovic in last seasons French Open in Paris, he was in London preparing for the grass-court season but did not feel the inclination to jump on the Eurostar.         
	Marat has left Melbourne after his third-round defeat to Roger Federer, and it does not sound as though he is coming back to support his sister this time either.         
	Marat celebrated his first Slam trophy, at the 2000 US Open, by immediately ordering in chilled vodka, but Safinas mooted celebratory tipple is pure water.         
	When Marat arrived in Australia ahead of the Melbourne Slam, he had a bruised and cut face, the result of a brawl in Moscow. Safinas appearance has changed for this tournament, as she has dropped 7kg (15lb) since that final in Roland Garros last June. This is the slimmer, trimmer, new-look Safina at Melbourne Park, and she Thursday defeated countrywoman Vera Zvonareva 6-3, 7-6(7-4), a match played under a closed roof in the Rod Laver Arena after the extreme heat rule was activated.         
	Safinas record against Williams is not a great one, as she has lost five of their previous six meetings, with her only victory coming on the red clay of Berlin last year, and even that came through a third-set tie-break.

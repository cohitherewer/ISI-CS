                                                     Vengeance is Bagans
  - I-League
  -   Green and maroon brigade start 2nd leg with 3-0 win         OUR CORRESPONDENT            Barreto scored the second goal on Friday                                 
	Mumbai: Mohun Bagan resumed their I-League campaign in the second leg from where they had left off in the first, as they smashed debutants Mumbai FC for a 3-0 win at the Cooperage here Friday.         
	A trademark scissor-kick from Bhaichung Bhutia opened the scoring in the second half and was followed by a classy solo run and finish by Jose Barreto. Substitute Lalawmpuiya rounded off the clinical performance with a 90th minute strike.         
	It was Bagans seventh win in a row following their six successive victories at the end of the first leg. The result also meant that the title contenders from Calcutta made up for their 1-2 loss to Mumbai FC at home in the opening round of the league.         
	The three points from the match improved Bagans tally to 24 and narrowed the gap between them and leaders Sporting Clube de Goa to one point.         
	The hosts seemed to have done their homework well as they kept Bagan on leash in the first half and for the opening minutes of the second.         
	The duo of Selwyn Fernandes and Anas Edathodika marked Bhutia and Barreto closely while Felix Aboagye and Abhishek Yadav kept the Bagan defenders busy.         
	But class ultimately prevailed. Even in the first half, Bagan had little problems in guarding their goal. And once the deadlock was broken in the 73rd minute, the complexion of the game changed.         
	A few minutes into the second half, Barreto had a clean run into the Mumbai FC goal area but his shot was blocked by Fernandes.         
	The Brazilian was once again in the thick of things when he entered the penalty box, but he was surrounded by too many yellow and blue shirts to be able to take a meaningful shot.         
	Meanwhile, Ishfaq Ahmeds frequent forays down the other flank began to stretch the Mumbai outfits defence and eventually the left back, which has been the hosts Achilles heel, gave away.         
	As Barreto moved away from his marker after entering the penalty area and back passed, James Singh was in position to make the perfect cross. And Bhutia wriggled himself free to connect his kick perfectly and lodge the ball into the near corner of the net.         
	Then Marcos Pereira set up Barreto with a slick pass from the middle and the overseas player showed he still had the speed to make a run from the half-line area and beat rival goalkeeper Amit Singha Roy for one of the easiest goals.         
	The match was over for all practical purposes when Puiya, replacing Bhutia, added to the tally with a clean strike from the left.

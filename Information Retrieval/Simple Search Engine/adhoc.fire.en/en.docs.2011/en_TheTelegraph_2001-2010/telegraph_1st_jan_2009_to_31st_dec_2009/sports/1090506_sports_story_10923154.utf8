The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jankovic beats off challenge
                                                   Jankovic beats off challenge
                      
	Rome: Holder Jelena Jankovic repelled a gutsy challenge from Argentinas Gisela Dulko to win a rain-hit match 6-3, 7-6(8) Tuesday and move into the third round of the Italian Open. The Serb, looking for her third consecutive Rome title, made an assured start to go 4-1 up but Dulko fought back after a pep talk with her coach, breaking in the seventh game with a fine forehand to pull to 4-3.         
	Jankovic took the next four games to win the first set and claimed a breakthrough in the second. But the 24-year-old could not hang on to the advantage before a storm halted play for three-and-a-half hours.

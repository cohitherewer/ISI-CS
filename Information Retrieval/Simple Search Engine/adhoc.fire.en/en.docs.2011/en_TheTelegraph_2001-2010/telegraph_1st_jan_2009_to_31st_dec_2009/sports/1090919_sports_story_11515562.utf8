The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Arctic Force may do the trick
                                                                                                               Arctic Force may do the trick
            STAR RACER                                      Vijay      
	Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singhs ward Arctic Force is capable of taking his better fancied rivals like Credit Squeeze and Secret Whispers by surprise in the 1,400m Calcutta Colts Trial Stakes, Saturdays main attraction. The Razeen-Forest Paradise son is beginning to mature, having started the season with a runaway victory over Spectacular Style. Arctic Force, though, failed narrowly in subsequent start, against a seasoned Bourbon Queen, the experience gained in an open class is sure to help his cause.          
	The Fillies version of the Stakes seems to be a straight contest between the southern challenger Gloriosa and Anastasia, from Western India. Gloriosas South India form, however, gives the Darius Byramjis trained filly a marginal edge over Anastasia. C. Alford partners both, Arctic Force and Gloriosa.

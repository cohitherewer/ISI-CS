The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev Milkha leads Asian challenge
                                                   Jeev Milkha leads Asian challenge
                                  Jeev Milkha Singh		    
	Minnesota: Reigning Asia No.1 Jeev Milkha Singh will have two-time US Open champion Retief Goosen and Open winner Justin Leonard for company in the first two rounds of the US PGA Championship starting at the Hazeltine National Golf Club here on Thursday.         
	Jeev will once again spearhead the Asian challenge in the elite event as the continent still yearns for its first Major winner. Apart from Jeev and Thai stalwart Thongchai Jaidee, Asian hopes would also rest on Korean trio of KJ Choi, Charlie Wi and Yang Yong-eun, Prayad Marksaeng of Thailand and Japanese Hiroyuki Fujita.         
	Over the next four days, Jeev will be aiming to reproduce the form that helped him finish tied ninth at last years PGA Championship which was his career first top-10 in a Major.         
	The Indian has struggled with a rib injury which forced him out of the British Open last month and made a return to the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, finishing tied 64th in the warm-up to his Hazeltine quest.         
	A good outing will also improve his chances of making the International Team for the Presidents Cup later this year where he currently lies in 11th position, with the top 10 earning an automatic selection into Greg Normans team.         
	Talking about the meets star attraction, Tiger Woods used to say it was only a great year if he won a Major. He has one shot left at the US PGA Championship, yet he already has rendered his verdict. Its been a great year either way, Woods said .         
	He already has five victories on the US PGA Tour, pushing his career total to 70 last week at the Bridgestone Invitational. His timing could use some improvement, for Woods arrived at Hazeltine having already completed the Pre-Slam  winning all four of his tournaments before a Major.         
	His reference point is the US PGA Championship a year ago, when he was home in Florida just learning to walk again after surgery on his left knee to rebuild the ligaments. Woods knew he would play again. He just wasnt sure what to expect.         
	Five victories? A scoring average that is a full stroke better than anyone else? For me to come back and play, and play as well as Ive done and actually win golf events ... to be honest with you, I dont think any of us would have thought I could have won this many events this year, he said.         
	He played a final practice round on Tuesday morning, and found the full measure of Hazeltine at 7,674 yards and a par 72. Walking along the fairways, he couldnt help notice pitch marks in the grass, evidence of the soft conditions from weekend rain.

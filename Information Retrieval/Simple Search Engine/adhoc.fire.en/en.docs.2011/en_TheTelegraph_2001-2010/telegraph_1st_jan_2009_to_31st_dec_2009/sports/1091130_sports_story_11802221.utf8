	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan, on Sunday, rode an Edeh Chidi goal from the spot to edge past Calcutta Customs in a CFL Premier Division match at the club ground. But the match, which lacked quality football, highlighted a few problems.         
	Since the advent of the I-League, the Calcutta Football League had been robbed of its sheen. This season, the CFL, which is being played simultaneously with the national league, have plummeted to a new low courtesy the Indian Football Associations decision to merge the Premier and Super division.         
	The gulf between newly promoted clubs and elite ones have only grown larger. And, on the Sunday, Bagans display showed that a similar gulf exists between the quality of Bagans first team and the reserves.         
	Bagan started with the inexperienced duo of Lalramluah and Souvik Chakraborty as central midfielders. The result was a drought of proper moves. Even the experience of Snehasish Chakraborty and Tomba Singh down the flanks was failing to ignite the sparks.         
	Chidi, however, was the culprit of missing at least four easy chances. The easiest was in the 70 th minute when he went past a Customs defender only to shoot over the horizontal with just the goalkeeper to beat.         
	Bagans new recruit Ryuji Sueoka also struggled as coach Karim Bencharifa paired him upfront with Chidi. The nippy Japanese appeared more comfortable in stitching passes than lurking in the rival box.         
	Twice the Bagan players  Branco Cardozo and Snehasish  managed to beat the advancing Rana Chakraborty, the Customs keeper, but their weak attempts were cleared by rival defenders before the ball could roll into the net.         
	And coming to the goal, Snehasish was brought down inside the box by Customs defender Shyamal Bhunia in the 33rd minute. The referee promptly pointed to the spot and Chidi obliged with a cool finish.         
	Teams         
	Mohun Bagan: Shilton Paul, Zenith Genius, Sheikh Azim, Sgaram Mandi, Biswajit Saha, Tomba Singh, Lalramluah (Subha Kumar, 67th), Souvik Chakraborty, Snehasish Chakraborty (Branco Cardozo, 83rd), Edeh Chidi, Ryuji Sueoka.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cink is in sync with Twitter
                                                     Cink is in sync with Twitter

	Turnberry: Stewart Cink may have won the oldest golf tournament in the world but when it comes to embracing the new he is at the forefront of his sport.         
	For a 36-year-old journeyman PGA Tour pro, who had only managed two top ten finishes this season, Cink has quite a following in the United States.         
	The reason is Cink talks the language of todays youth. That means in no more than 140 characters, for Cink is a prolific user of Twitter, the social networking website on which users post short messages.         
	Cink has gained more than half a million followers on the site in a matter of months and has been busy this week revealing his fear that a nagging cold could be swine flu.         
	That was followed by snapping a picture of the vending machine in the Turnberry locker room revealing, perhaps to the embarrassment of the R amp;A, that it sells condoms.         
	He has also let it be known he fell in love with Guinness while warming up for this event on links courses in Ireland where he did not shoot under par once.         
	Cink is renowned for being a straight talker born in Alabama with a love for the outdoors which may have helped him hike through some of the wildest rough he admitted he had ever seen when he first arrived on the Ayrshire coast last week.         
	He should not really have been that shocked for this was Cinks 12th Open championship appearance. He has never really challenged before, missing the cut in three of his last four attempts, but suggested he could be a winner two years ago when he tied sixth at Carnoustie. At that point Cink was at the top of his game and had clocked up more than $20million in winnings on the PGA tour.         
	But this has been a bad year and in desperate times golfers often clutch for answers. For Cink that meant throwing away his belly putter and returning to the more traditional short putter that he used with aplomb at times on Sunday. It means that the game is still waiting for its first Major winner with the longer shafted putter.         
	Cink turned at the age off 22 and had to start racking up the dollars quickly. While still a student at Georgie Tech he was married with children by the time he graduated and took his first steps on the PGA tour.         
	Perhaps the necessity of having to provide for a young family fired Cink because he was soon winning awards. He was PGA tour rookie of the year in 1997 claiming the Greater Hartford Open title and earning more than $800,000 in the process, only one other player had made more in his first season as a professional, another Open champion David Duval.         
	It set Cink on the path to a lucrative career that has seen him make money if not history. Cink is a grinder. A man who pays the ills by a consistent performance on the tour even if only five victories have come his way during 14 years in the professional game.         
	Only once before had Cink threatened to succeed on the big stage and then he was overwhelmed and under prepared for the challenge of playing Tiger Woods. Cink was overcautious and tense when he took on Woods in the final of the World Match Play and lasted just 29 off the possible 36 holes losing 8 amp; 7. He was whisked away from the course with a PGA tour officials telling the gallery of photographers Let him get out of here. But Cink has worked on his mental toughness. Sunday he drew on this at the 18th when he had to make birdie to have a chance of winning. The putt on 18th I hit without a care in the world, he said.

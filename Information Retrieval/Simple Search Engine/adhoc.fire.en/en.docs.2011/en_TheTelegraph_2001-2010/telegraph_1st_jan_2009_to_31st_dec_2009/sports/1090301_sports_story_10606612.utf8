The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Security for one-dayers beefed up 
                                                   Security for one-dayers beefed up 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The on-ground security measures will be increased for the upcoming one-day International series between India and New Zealand, according to information forwarded by New Zealand Cricket.         
	This decision has been taken after spectators threw bottles onto the ground at the Twenty20 International in Wellington Friday. Play was halted briefly towards the end of the New Zealand innings after a plastic bottle was thrown from the crowd on to the ground. Concerns over the incident were expressed by the Indian team and by match referee Ranjan Madugalle.         
	During the last over of the exciting match Friday, missiles were thrown onto the ground and play was held up twice as Zaheer Khan and India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni drew the attention of the umpires. After the first ball and then again before the last ball, missiles from the galleries landed near the Indian fielders.         
	NZC chief executive Justin Vaughan said steps were already underway to provide increased security for the five-match ODI series, which begins at McLean Park, Napier, on Tuesday.         
	Measures will include an increase in the numbers of security staff, higher security visibility in potential problem areas, and closer monitoring and awareness of the crowd. Security staff would be instructed to take extra precautions to shield boundary fielders, and to take prompt action against offenders. Additional measures will be considered.         
	This type of incident is unfortunate  especially in such an exciting and close game as we saw last night (Friday), said Vaughan.         
	Fortunately it does not occur often. New Zealand Cricket is fully committed to providing a high level of security, and I have given my assurance to the Indian team that increased security will be in place for the upcoming series.

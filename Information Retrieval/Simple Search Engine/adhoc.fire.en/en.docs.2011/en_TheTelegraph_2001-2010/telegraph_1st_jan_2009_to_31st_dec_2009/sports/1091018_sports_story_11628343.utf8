The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tevez issues quit threat 
                                                   Tevez issues quit threat 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Manchester City forward Carlos Tevz has threatened to quit the Argentina national team in protest at criticism directed at him in his home country.         
	Argentinas players and coach Diego Maradona have been heavily criticised, despite qualifying for the World Cup this week.         
	The former Manchester United and West Ham striker said: When I play for Argentina I spend more time suffering than enjoying myself. The fans insulted us, the journalists criticised everything. Sometimes I think about quitting the national team. Why should I come to Argentina and have a bad time?         
	Last week Tevez had hit back at critics who have stated that the Argentina players care more about money than playing for their country. Tevez was infuriated that suggestions have been made that the reason Argentina are struggling to reach the World Cup is because of commitment issues. Do they think that when I go out to play for the national team Im thinking of the millions I have in the bank? I dont need to be given money to play in the national team, he said.

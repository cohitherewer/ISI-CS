The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Strauss to lead in ODIs too
                                                   Strauss to lead in ODIs too
            TIMES ONLINE                      
	Andrew Strauss will lead England for their entire tour of the West Indies, including four Tests, five one-day Internationals and one Twenty20 match.         
	Strauss has not played a limited-overs international since the 2007 World Cup, and had not been initially included in Englands one-day squad for the forthcoming tour of the Caribbean.         
	I am delighted to lead the team in the one-day Internationals and Twenty20, Strauss, 31, said. I know I havent played an ODI since the end of the World Cup but I do feel that I have something to offer in that form of the game.         
	Now that this situation has been resolved, we can all unite and get about the business of winning cricket matches for England and winning them consistently.         
	Strauss replaced Kevin Pietersen as England captain after the Hampshire batsman fell out with coach Peter Moores, and eventually resigned.         
	The selectors feel that it is important to have stability and continuity on the Caribbean tour given the events of the last few days, Geoff Miller, the national selector said. Andrew and I have also agreed that we will review the one-day captaincy at the end of the tour. Andrew is extremely comfortable with that.         
	However, England will not be appointing a new head coach for the West Indies tour. Instead, Andy Flower, the current assistant coach, and Phil Neale, Englands team operations manager, will lead the existing backroom staff when the squad departs on January 21.

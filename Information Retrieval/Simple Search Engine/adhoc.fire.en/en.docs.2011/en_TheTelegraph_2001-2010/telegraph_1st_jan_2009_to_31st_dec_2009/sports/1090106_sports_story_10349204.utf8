	Sydney: With the SCG pitch cracking up faster than the global economy, Australias gameplan was to fire the ball in hard and straight. The method was best exemplified by the former woodchopping champion Peter Siddle, who clean-bowled three South Africans and hit two more on the pads. Its not often that you see a five-wicket haul without the intervention of a single fielder.         
	Englands batsmen should be watching Siddle closely, because he could easily be the spearhead of Australias Ashes attack next summer. He is not particularly tall for a fast bowler, but he is built like a rugby player and has vast reserves of stamina. A high proportion of his victims have been beaten for pure pace.         
	You look at Siddles speeds all day and he never seems to drop below 90mph, said Mark Boucher after play. He always hits the splice of the bat, and when you have somebody bringing the ball back into the right-hander on this sort of pitch he is bound to cause problems.         
	Brett Lees future may be in doubt after the latest operation on his much-abused left ankle, but the Australians always seem to have plenty of fast-bowling depth. When the England selectors called up Victoria-bred Darren Pattinson for last summers Headingley Test, his grade coach commented that There are probably 60 blokes in Australia capable of doing what hes done.         
	Siddle, like Pattinson, is a Victorian. He is also hugely inexperienced; this is only his 17th first-class game. But he has such a simple method  run up, aim at stumps, repeat  that not much can go wrong. His only real variation is a vicious bouncer that had his opposite number Dale Steyn retreating to leg.         
	With left-armer Mitchell Johnson also in the wickets, and Stuart Clark about to begin his comeback from elbow surgery, the Australians are in the process of assembling a decent seam attack. Their other fast man here, Doug Bollinger, has also bowled well without reward, thanks to some indifferent umpiring decisions from Asoka de Silva.         
	South Africa put up a tough fight, dragging themselves back from 193 for five (effectively six, because of Graeme Smiths broken finger) with the help of a three-hour stand between Boucher and Morne Morkel. This plucky rearguard fitted the pattern of the series, in which tailenders from both sides have proved harder to shift than red wine stains. But it couldnt last, not on a surface which Boucher described as among the most difficult day three pitches I have ever batted on  its not good when you have to run down the side of the pitch to avoid falling down a crack.         
	The stand had realised 115 when Morkel, who has one of the sketchier techniques in world cricket, was cleaned up by a Siddle special. From there, it took Siddle just 20 more balls to whip through the last three wickets, each of them captured by a full, straight, stump-seeking missile.         
	South Africa finished on 327 all out  a first-innings deficit of 118 runs  which left the Australians an awkward half-hour to negotiate. They could have played for stumps, but instead Matthew Hayden decided to gamble, laying into Steyns first over with a lofted cover-drive and a rasping pull.         
	Haydens Test career is on life support at present, and it might even have flatlined if the fourth ball of Steyns over  which rolled along the ground and hit him low on the shin  had not mysteriously been ruled to be going down the leg-side by De Silva. Hayden went in unbeaten on 18, his prospects of Ashes selection still hanging in the balance.

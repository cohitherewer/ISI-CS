    - Nelson piquet must be crazy, says former Formula one driver             OUR CORRESPONDENT            David Coulthard                                 
	Mumbai: Former Formula One driver David Coulthard feels an Indian driver racing with the Force India team would help the popularity of the sport in the country but said the choice should be based on the skill factor.         
	If you want to get any country involved (in F1), it is important to have local support and getting a (local) driver would help a lot. But it is also about driving the car, Coulthard, in India on a promotional, said here Thursday.         
	You have a couple of guys with potential but it would be difficult to say how they would do if you put them in the car, the 38-year-old Scot, popularly known as DC, said referring to Narain Karthikeyan and Karun Chandhok.         
	Age is not an issue (Karthikeyan is 32). It is about opportunity. Karun is racing in GP2, so I have seen him more. There seems to be good potential, but honestly it is difficult to say how a driver would do when he moves from one form of racing to another.         
	But you can give them a chance, you never know.         
	Coulthard, who is the highest points-scorer among British drivers and one of the eight to have raced in more than 200 Grands Prix, said the exorbitant licence fee a country has to pay to get hosting rights was an issue but that it was unavoidable. The fee varies from country to country. Promoters of the Indian Grand Prix in 2011 have agreed to pay approximately $30 million  but are yet to get a clearance from the Reserve Bank of India  whereas the glamorous Monaco GP pays much less.         
	Its a valid point but then what comes for free? If you take Scotland, a GP will never happen there because there is no way we are going to shell out that kind of money. But India has huge potential he said.         
	Coulthard, now an ambassador for Red Bull Racing and their occasional test driver, is scheduled to drive the Red Bull Car on the Bandra-Worli Sea Link on Sunday.         
	Driving in India needs a different technique, doesnt it, the Briton joked after a drive on the Sea Link Thursday, as a passenger. It (the road) is bumpy. Its going to be challenging and interesting, said Coulthard, who is also expected to do some stunts in the F1 car.         
	As regards the race-fixing scandal, Coulthard said Nelson Piquet Jr. had to take more responsibility for his actions.         
	I think so. I dont know how anyone can physically crash a F1 car? All through my career I was trying to avoid a crash, he said.         
	Obviously the bosses would want you to do certain things for the sake of the team and I have been asked to do things which benefited the team but not me. One has to be a team player but he has taken it too far. He must be crazy.         
	As for Kimi Raikkonen, who was left with no contract at the end of 2009 after Ferrari roped in Fernando Alonso in his place, Coulthard said McLaren would be the right place for the Finn.         
	It would be a loss if Kimi moves out of F1 to rallying. He is a character, even though he is quiet, Coulthard said on the 2007 World Champion.         
	Kimi is an introvert. He is a great, great driver but he is not going to go and motivate a set of 600 employees McLaren would be the best place for him because he is quick but not commercially. Lewis (Hamilton) is there for that, and I want to see Lewis against Kimi.         
	Coulthard, who raced in F1 from 1994 to 2008, said it was seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher who deserved the tag of all-time great.         
	If Schumacher was driving a Minardi, he wouldnt have won a single Grand Prix. But there is no doubt that he is a champion, Coulthard said.         
	He had the ability to motivate an entire team. He would be up at five in the morning and stay back till late at night. He deserved to win the races; he really worked hard for it.         
	He had his share of controversies but the bottomline is, if you go through every history book, the most points, the most wins, all the records are his. I cant imagine anyone coming close.

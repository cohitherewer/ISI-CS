The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sporting in crucial tie vs Dempo SC
                                                   Sporting in crucial tie vs Dempo SC
                      
	Margao: Title aspirant Sporting Clube de Goa will be looking to garner full points when they face Dempo on Thursday in their crucial ONGC I-league match at the Nehru Stadium in Margao.         
	Sporting, who are aiming to win their maiden title, suffered a body blow when they were held to a draw by United FC, which saw them drop two points. They are on the second spot of the points table with 35 points from 17 matches, one behind leaders Churchill Brothers who have played a match more.         
	Sportings coach Clifford Chukwuma knows that his team cannot afford to drop points further.         
	Its a tough match and the pressure is on us to perform. We are fighting for the title, Chukwuma said.         
	For Dempo, Clifford Miranda will not play the match due to double booking and Nicolau Borges will replace him. Joaquim Abranches, nursing an ankle injury, has still not recovered. Keymen Roberto DSilva and Ranty Martins will be available for the match.         
	Martins form is the main concern for coach Armando Colaco. (PTI)

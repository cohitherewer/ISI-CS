The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AIFF comes up with Plan B
                                                   AIFF comes up with Plan B
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The I-League and the Federation Cup may remain suspended for eight months between June 2010 and January 2011 under the revised plan for the Goal 2011 project, according to All-India Football Federation (AIFF) sources.         
	The new proposal, which has been named Plan B, has already been circulated between all the I-League clubs and senior AIFF members. The matter will be discussed at a meeting to be held at the Football House in the capital on April 17.         
	As per Plan B, the AIFF will select 25 players at the start of the 2010-11 season and keep them under its fold from June 1, 2010 till January 31, 2011. In between these players will not be allowed to play for their respective club sides.         
	The plan also proposes to keep the I-League and the Federation Cup suspended during the eight-month period when the players will be in the national camp. The I-League will only start on February 1, 2011 after the national team players return from Doha.         
	Under this plan, the AIFF will pay the players during their eight-month stay with the national team. For the rest of the season, which is likely to be extended, the clubs will have to take care of the footballers.         
	The AIFF, however, has yet to discard its initial proposal of keeping the players with the national team for nearly two seasons. Under this plan, the players are supposed to be with national coach Bob Houghton from July 1, 2009 till January 31, 2011.

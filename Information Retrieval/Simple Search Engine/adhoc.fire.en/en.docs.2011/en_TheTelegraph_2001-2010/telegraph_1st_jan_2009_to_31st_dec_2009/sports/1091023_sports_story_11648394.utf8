The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Button presses for a new deal
                                                     Button presses for a new deal
            Kevin Garside.            Jenson Button                           
	London: It gets worse. Jenson Button flying budget airlines is not the half of it. Britains new Formula One world champion had to wash his own overalls between races, too. And when the bill went in to Brawn for settlement, the accounts department allegedly knocked it back.         
	The portrayal of a team moving forward together following Buttons success in Brazil contrasts sharply with the picture being painted by some behind the scenes. Morale among key members of staff, including Button, is said to be low. Negotiations over a new contract are at a standstill, casting doubts over Buttons future with the team.         
	It is understood that the world champion has received offers from more than one grid rival, ready to cash in on his success. Button would prefer to stay at Brawn but will not remain on any terms.         
	Button took a pay cut estimated at 80 per cent for the privilege of racing in the car that took him to the world championship. Though he continues to put a smile to his celebrations, he is understood to be disappointed by an offer only marginally higher and nowhere near the sum he was paid by his previous employers, Honda, thought to be about 10m a year.         
	Were Buttons former salary to be restored, as he expected when the good times returned, it would still leave him some way behind the annual wages of the grids top earners, Kimi Raikkonen (25m), Fernando Alonso (20m) and Lewis Hamilton (15m).         
	Button is not the only malcontent. A number of senior engineering staff are said to be upset over bonus arrangements. News of the discontent at Brawn has filtered down the pit lane, prompting rival teams, including Red Bull, McLaren and Ferrari, to attempt to lure the top brains behind the championship-winning car with lucrative job offers.         
	Speaking from Brazil, Brawn chief executive Nick Fry expressed his surprise at the developments, insisting he knew nothing of any unrest. Fry said: No one has said anything to me about this. As far as we are concerned these are internal matters but if there is an issue with anybody, we are quite happy to talk to them about it.         
	About Buttons position, Fry said: Salary negotiation is not something we do in public. However, I will say that any and all contractual bonuses will, of course, be paid. We will be sitting down with Jenson after Abu Dhabi to discuss his contract.         
	The surprising success of Brawn this season has led to interest from prospective investors with Mercedes, who supplied the engine this season, considering taking a majority stake in the team. A deal with a heavyweight sponsor has also been signed for next year, though the identity of the backer has yet to be revealed.         
	In the deal that saved the team from closure, struck with Honda in February little more than a fortnight before the season started, funds sufficient for two seasons at a stretch were left in the pot, approximately 100m. However, the emergence of Mercedes as a potential buyer and the signing of a significant sponsor has yet to loosen the purse strings.         
	The onus is on the teams senior management, principal shareholder Ross Brawn and Fry, to reach out to Button and the disgruntled members of the engineering team to prevent the fairytale unravelling.

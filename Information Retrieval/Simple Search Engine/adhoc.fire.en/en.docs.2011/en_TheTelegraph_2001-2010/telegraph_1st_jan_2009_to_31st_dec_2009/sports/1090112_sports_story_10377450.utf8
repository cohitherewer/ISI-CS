                                                     Will analyse this loss, says Somdev
            OUR CORRESPONDENT              Somdev Dev Varman in action against Marin Cilic in Chennai on Sunday. (AFP)                            
	Chennai: Somdev Dev Varman might have lost the Chennai Open final but his performance has announced the arrival of a star in Indian tennis. The Guwahati-born US-based youngster spoke to the media after finishing runner-up to Marin Cilic.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q: Would you say the performance mattered more than the result today?         
	A: Yes and no. Losing is not a feeling you like. Performance matters but the result is equally important at the level I play. For me its the way I compete and Im happy with the way I played today, but losing doesnt feel good.         
	What according to you was the turning point in the match?         
	Not converting the two breakpoints in the 11th game of the second set. I had a lot of chances today but he played some great tennis on crucial points. I also did not play great at 4-5 in the first set, did a double fault and the drop shot was not the smartest thing to do. These are the lessons I have to learn.         
	How would rate your performance?         
	I have to start better on points but I dont want to get too negative about this loss. I want to treat it the same way I would had it been otherwise.         
	Some of your shots were landing in the middle instead of the baseline. Was it a strategy?         
	No. The double fault wasnt a strategy either (grins). Short balls are not what I play normally. Sometimes these things are forced by the opponent, sometimes its your own. Today it was a mix of both. It is another area to improve for me. I will definitely go back and analyse this loss.         
	Was there a drop in intensity at the start of the second set?         
	It was unintentional. Its another aspect of the game I can improve on. It was a couple of minutes of mental lapse which big players like Nadal or Hewitt wont suffer.         
	What is the difference between the Somdev who played the 2007 Mumbai Open and the player at the 2008 Chennai Open?         
	Maturity. One always wants to think that not much has changed over the years but a lot changes, especially in your tennis, otherwise what is the point?

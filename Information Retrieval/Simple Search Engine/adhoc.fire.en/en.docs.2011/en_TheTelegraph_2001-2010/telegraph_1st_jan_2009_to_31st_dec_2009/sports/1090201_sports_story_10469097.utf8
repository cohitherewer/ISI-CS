                                                     Serena back at the top
    - American romps to 10th grand slam singles title           Mark Hodgkinson in Melbourne            Serena Williams with the trophy in Melbourne on Saturday. (AP)                                 
	The fortnight at Melbourne Park will see an outbreak of tennis hooliganism, a defeat for Andy Murray will prompt at least one radio station to have an inquest and a phone-in within the hour, and Serena Williams will win the title in an odd-numbered year, as Saturdays victory followed triumphs for the Californian in 2003, 2005 and 2007.         
	Take the womens final on Saturday night in Melbourne, a final devoid of any uncertainty. This was the first evening womens final in Australia, but the night when Williams returned to the top of the rankings, and also joined the double-digit club for Slam titles, was so one-sided it was a non-event.         
	Safinas significant contribution to the match consisted of one air-shot and three games; she didnt even bounce her racket in annoyance on the court with anything like her usual style or gusto.         
	Williams won 6-0, 6-3 in just under an hour, the final had all the drama and excitement of the pre-match warm-up, and the night will largely be remembered for these fabulously disingenuous comments from the champions on-court speech: Dinara was hitting the ball so hard that I had to go for broke, that was all I could do to stay in there. Dinara, thank you so much for putting on such a great show for womens tennis.         
	So what would a bad show for womens tennis look like? Contrast this with the tennis on the Rod Laver Arena the night before, when Rafael Nadal and Fernando Verdasco needed more than five hours to settle who was going through to the mens final.         
	The local television network could have shown Williams versus Safina five times over in the period it took Nadal to win his semi-final  not that many would have wanted to have seen this womens final replayed even once.         
	Safina had suggested beforehand that she would have celebrated a possible first major title with pure water, a little different to her older brother Marat Safin who ordered in chilled vodka after winning a maiden Slam, but any thoughts of a Russian victory turned out to be pure fantasy, pure indulgence.         
	Safina, in her post-match remarks to the crowd, at least gave a more accurate summing-up of the night than Williams did, by saying graciously: Serena just played too good  I was just like a ball kid on the court today. And this was on the evening when Safina walked on court with the chance to earn both the trophy and the world No 1 ranking.         
	Williams really was too good for Safina, too good for any chance of this being a decent evenings entertainment. As early as the second game, Safinas errors were greeted by a sympathetic aah  if the crowd could have reached out and patted her on the top of the head, they would have done.         
	Safina had been hoping to mark out her and Safin, the 2000 US Open champion and the 2005 Australian Open winner, as the first sister and brother to score Slam singles titles. But the Safin family are never going to come close to achieving anything like the success that the Williams sisters have had in tennis.         
	This was the third Slam tournament in succession that had seen a Williams finish as the champion, after Venus won Wimbledon and Serena took the US Open prize. Their father, Richard, always said that the younger of his two tennis-playing daughters was going to have the most success, and he was right, as Serena leads Venus by 10 trophies to seven.         
	The 27-year-old has long argued that she was still the best female tennis player in the world, and now the ranking computer has been won over.              THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

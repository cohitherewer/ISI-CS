The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Manipur hold Bengal
                                                   Manipur hold Bengal
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Chennai: Bengals chances of qualifying for the semi-finals suffered a serious blow when they were held to a 1-1 draw by Manipur in a Santosh Trophy quarter final league match at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Chennai on Thursday. In another match, Punjab defeated Tamil Nadu 1-0 thanks to a 78th minute penalty by Jagpreet Singh.         
	After P.C. Lalawmpuiya put Bengal ahead in the 10th minute, Manipur got the equaliser on the hour mark through Subhas Singh.         
	On Saturday, in their last group matches, Manipur cross swords with Tamil Nadu while Bengal play Punjab. Manipur and Punjab need to draw their respective matches to advance to the last-four stage.         
	Bengal need a win to make it to the semi-finals. Manipur now top the group with four points from two matches while Punjab are second with three. They are followed by Bengal (2) and Tamil Nadu (1).         
	Its a do-or-die match for us, said Raghu Nandy from Chennai. We missed too many chances today (Thursday) and were badly let down by goalkeeper Abhra (Mondal). If you cant convert chances then how can you expect full points, he added.         
	Mondal, in fact got the nod ahead of Subhashish Roy Choudhury. Mondal as it turned out, was no better. He failed to collect an innocuous Bisheshwor Singh volley and R. Vasum, who was lurking nearby, laid it off for Subhas. The Air India striker gleefully tapped the ball in much to the delight of the Manipur bench. Bengal forged ahead in the 10th minute when Shubho Kumar played to Lalawmpuiya and Chirag Uniteds new signing got past his marker and slotted it home.

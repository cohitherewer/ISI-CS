The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania Mirza ousted in doubles too
                                                   Sania Mirza ousted in doubles too
                      
	Wimbledon: Out of the singles competition, Sania Mirzas doubles campaign also ended after she and her partner Chia-Jung Chuang suffered a straight set loss to Alla Kudryavtseva and Monica Niculescu in the second round of the Wimbledon Championships on Saturday.         
	The 15th seeded Indo-Taipei pair lost 2-6, 3-6 to the unseeded Russian-Romanian combination.         
	Sania and Chuang had their chances but failed to grab on those.         
	Out of seven break points they got they could convert just one and paid the price.         
	Sanias singles campaign was cut short earlier in the week in the second round when she lost to her friend Sorana Cirstea.         
	The Indian would now look to put up a better show in the mixed doubles event where she and compatriot Mahesh Bhupathi have been seeded 13th.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ground draws Salman flak
                                                   Ground draws Salman flak
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Al-Wehdats Iraqi coach Akram Ahmed Salman was in a complaining mood despite his teams 2-1 win against Mohun Bagan in the AFC Cup match.         
	The ground was not good, weather was inhuman. You cant play soccer in these conditions, the coach rattled off in broken English. We managed to win mainly because Bagan was not that good on the day. If they had pressed harder we could have lost the match, Salman said.         
	Salman blamed his second string sides lack of competitive match practice for the Tuesday show. Some of the players played after two months. As I said on the eve of the match, we are more bothered about the Arab Champions League. Still I am happy I am returning with three points, he said.         
	The Iraqi coach said that Bhaichung Bhutia and Rahul Kumar looked impressive but the same cannot be said of the rest. This team need to work harder if they want to make an impact, was his advice.         
	His Mohun Bagan counterpart Karim Bencharifa was pleased with his teams performance and urged his boys to concentrate now on the I-League. We fielded an inexperienced side as we consciously decided to focus on I-League, he said. The Moroccan said his team conceded two silly goals, which could have been avoided.

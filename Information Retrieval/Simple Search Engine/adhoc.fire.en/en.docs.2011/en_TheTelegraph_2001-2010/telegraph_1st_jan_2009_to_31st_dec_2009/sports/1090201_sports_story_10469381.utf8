The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICL decision deferred
                                                   ICL decision deferred
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Saturday deferred a decision on Indian Cricket Leagues (ICL) application for official recognition and held back its plan of starting an enhanced Test championship following reservations from two members.         
	Consideration of the ICLs application for approval by the ICC was deferred pending further discussions between representatives of the BCCI, ICL and the ICC, a statement issued after the first days deliberations of the two-day meeting said.         
	The ICC board did not mention any proposed date for the meeting.         
	On the plan of incorporating an enhanced Test championship in the Futures Tour Programme (FTP) post 2012, the ICC said owing to reservations from the BCCI and ECB, it was forced to shelve the plan for the moment.         
	The board also decided to take up the overrate issue in subsequent meetings.         
	The meeting also felt that Zimbabwe was not yet ready to be ushered back into Test cricket.

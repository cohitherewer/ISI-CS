	New Delhi: An 86th-minute strike by substitute Jeje Lalpekhlua helped India under-23 beat Afghanistan 1-0 in their opening group league match of the SAFF Cup in Dhaka on Saturday.         
	The four-time champions were under pressure in the first-half but pulled off the all-important goal four minutes before the final whistle when a long ball from the defence found Lalpekhlua inside the box.         
	The Indian striker, who came in for Balwant Singh in the 72nd minute, managed to control the ball before slamming past the Afghanistan goalkeeper.         
	Considering the fact it was the first international match for most of the players, I am happy to return with the three points, said the Indian coach Sukhwinder Singh.         
	The former JCT technical director also praised custodian Arindam Bhattacharya for making a couple of good saves.         
	Central midfielder Jagpreet Singh suffered a minor knee injury but the coach felt the footballer from JCT should be able to play in the next match against Nepal.

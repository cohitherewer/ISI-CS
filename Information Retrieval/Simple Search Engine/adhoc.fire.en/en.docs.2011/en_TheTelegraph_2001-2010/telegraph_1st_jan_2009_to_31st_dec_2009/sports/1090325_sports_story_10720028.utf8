The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Goal 2011 is a mere gimmick
                                                                                                                   Goal 2011 is a mere gimmick

	In the past few days, I read several newspaper reports on the All India Football Federations proposed Goal 2011 project for the Asia Cup in Doha . I am hardly surprised that there are not many takers for this unique idea.        
	One thing is for sure that the architects of this plan are far removed from the realities of Indian football. It appears to be more of a marketing gimmick. Any implementation of it may temporarily lift the standard of the national team in a few matches but the after effects could be disastrous.        
	I fully agree that qualifying for the 2011 Asia Cup is an important achievement but it shouldnt be magnified to a level where all other activities would be forced to come to a standstill. Please note, there will be life after Asia Cup for Indian football.        
	There are few in the AIFF who are trying to justify the project by comparing it with what Mexico , the US and South Korea did in past. These nations, too, kept their respective squads strictly reserved for national duties for long periods before the World Cup.        
	Let me remind you, all these countries did it for a common cause. They restored to such tactics only when they played hosts to the World Cup. We, too, did it when India staged the Asian Games in 1982. On all these occasions, there were much more at stake than merely playing an Asia Cup in a far away country.        
	Frankly, I dont blame Bob Houghton if he has mooted this idea. He has worked hard to take India to the Asia Cup final rounds after 24 years. No coach would like to see his efforts go waste and Houghton is no exception.        
	As a former national coach, I can well understand Houghtons anxiety. If he has asked for a group of 25 players to be kept under him till the Asia Cup, it is because he is badly handicapped by the paucity of good footballers in India . For this, I squarely blame those who are at the helm of the affairs.        
	The AIFF, in all these years, has failed to produce a comprehensive Youth Development Programme (YDP) to be followed across the country. What is going on here in the name of YDP is a makeshift programme to play a few international tournaments every year.         
	I have been told that the federation has spent a fortune last season in training the national age group teams. Certainly a good gesture but unfortunately, it is not going to produce the desired results.        
	A group of 30 players is too small to bring the necessary overall improvement. What we need is a broad-based programme for, say, 10,000 players. Only then we may hope to get a few players of some standard in future.        
	But then, this is a technical matter and should be handled by people with at least some practical knowledge of the game. Our national federation, sadly though, does not have much time for such people. Otherwise, why its technical committee didnt have met even once in the last three years?        
	Take it from me, however big you plan the writing is on the wall  we would still struggle to cross the hurdles of the first round in the 2011 Asia Cup. Houghton has done enough with limited resources. I dont expect him to perform miracles under the present circumstances.

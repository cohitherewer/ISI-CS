                                                                                                                                   Baljit badly hurt in accident
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                Baljit Sahni      
	New Delhi: Top JCT striker Baljit Sahni was seriously injured when he met with a road accident in Margao, Goa on Tuesday night and could be out of action for several months.         
	Also injured in the accident was JCT stopper back Sunil Kumar. Both were travelling on a motorbike that skidded near the Margao market. JCT is presently camping in Goa to play their next I-League match against Salgaocar on Saturday.         
	Currently the top scorer amongst the Indians in the I-League with six goals, Sahni fractured his right wrist and suffered deep cuts all over his body. Sahni had to be given 35 stitches at the Apollo Victor Hospital in Margao and would undergo a wrist operation on Thursday.         
	The news has come as a big shock for me, said Sukhwinder Singh, the national coach for the SAFF Cup in Dhaka beginning next month. Sahni was in fine form this season and could have been our mainstay.         
	JCT coach Parminder Singh said both the footballers are still in hospital. Sunil also had to be given five stitches. He has suffered some injuries on the face that could take some time to heal. I am not sure when both of them will resume action, he said.

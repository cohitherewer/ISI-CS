The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Randhawa tied 2nd
                                                   Randhawa tied 2nd
                      
	Kent: Jyoti Randhawa rode on a flawless front-nine to card a six-under 66 for a share of the second spot, while Shiv Kapur and Jeev Milkha Singh grabbed the tied sixth position after returning identical 67s in the opening round of the The European Open here.         
	Randhawa sank seven birdies against a lone bogey to be just a stroke adrift of the lead. In a blemish-free front-nine, Randhawa picked up birdies on the second, third, sixth and ninth holes to make the turn four-under.         
	On his way back, he stumbled to a bogey on the 11th but got his act together to gain shots on the 12th, 13th and 15th.         
	Jeev, on the other hand, played out a bogey-free round. The seasoned pro struck birdies on the fifth, eight, 12th, 15th and 18th to round off an excellent day.

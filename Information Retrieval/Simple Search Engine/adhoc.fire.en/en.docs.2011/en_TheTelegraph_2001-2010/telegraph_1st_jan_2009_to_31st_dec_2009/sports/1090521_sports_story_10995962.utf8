The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We didnt lack in intensity, says Sehwag
                                                   We didnt lack in intensity, says Sehwag
                      
	Johannesburg: Delhi captain Virender Sehwag has dismissed suggestions that his side did not fight with intensity in their match against the Royal Challengers Bangalore but admitted the players were a bit relaxed.         
	No. Its nothing like that. We were trying to make sure that a lot of the reserve players get a chance to play before the semi-finals. It is important that we give everyone a chance because it is quite easy for players to get frustrated after sitting on the sidelines, Sehwag told reporters.         
	We were a bit relaxed, I agree, because maybe we have already made it to the semi-finals. But hopefully we will do well in the coming matches, he added.         
	The flamboyant opener believes one bad over tilted the game in favour of the Challengers, who triumphed by seven wickets on Tuesday. Debutant Yogesh Nagar was hit for two consecutive sixes by Ross Taylor late in the chase to close the gap between the required runs and balls. If Nagar was not hit for so many runs in an over, this match, too, would have been close.         
	The DareDevils captain also refused to admit that defeat just ahead of the semi-finals would break their momentum. Weve never lost two games in-a-row. So momentum is still with us. I dont think we have lost momentum. Sometimes one mistake can mess up your chances, he said.         
	On being asked if his and Gambhirs poor form is hurting the team, Sehwag said: We always hope to do well but it does not always go your way. We will keep trying. I think we are just one innings away from getting our form back.         
	The opener was happy with the way the middle-order has responded despite not getting good starts from the openers. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav, Bhajji hail move
                                                   Sourav, Bhajji hail move
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former India captain Rahul Dravids recall to the squad, for the tri-series in Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in South Africa, has been hailed by Sourav Ganguly and Harbhajan Singh, both of whom were of the opinion that the move augurs well for Team India.         
	Speaking on the sidelines of a condolence meeting for Subhas Chakraborty at the Eden, Sourav said Dravids inclusion was the right choice, while Harbhajan, attending the foundation stone laying ceremony of a private hospital on the outskirts of the city, said, in the absence of the swashbuckling Virender Sehwag, it would be a fillip for India.         
	Rahul is the right choice for the team. He may be 36-years old but that is not a factor. Being a junior or a senior is not the criterion for selection Performance is the key. Even Ashish Nehra had made a comeback on the strength of his performance. There shouldnt be any issues with the selection process as it is on the right track, Sourav said.         
	Earlier in the day, Harbhajan said: Its a great move by the selectors to include someone of his (Dravids) stature. Sehwag is not there and in his absence Rahul is the best choice. No doubt Sehwag will be missed, but Rahuls addition comes as a boost.         
	Harbhajan rejected talk that the absence of speedster Zaheer Khan, who is nursing an injury, would be detrimental to Team India and said that, on the contrary, it will be an opportunity for the others to cement their places in the team.         
	Zaheer will be missed But we have a good team and it will be, in fact, a good opportunity for Ishant (Sharma) and Ashish (Nehra) to cement their places. Im sure they will perform well, he said.         
	On the inclusion of leg-spinner Amit Mishra in place of left-armer Pragyan Ojha, the wily off-spinner side-stepped the issue saying it was the decision of the selectors.         
	As for the Indian cricketers reluctance to accept the whereabouts clause of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) code, Harbhajan said: We said whatever we felt. We are not convinced about the whereabouts clause and that is why we didnt agree. I dont think other sportspersons should tell us what to do, as we never interfere in their affairs. They should also respect our views.         
	Asked if the team was aware that victory in Sri Lanka might take them to the top of the ICC ODI rankings, he said: We are the No.1 team in the world It doesnt matter what the rankings or the people say.         
	He was also all praises for Sourav saying that the former India captain was probably one of the greatest leaders in India. He is a great leader, both on and off the field. If he gets back at the helm of the Kolkata Knight Riders (IPL franchise), it will be good for the team. Just hope they dont click against us! the Mumbai Indians player said.         
	In the morning, Harbhajan had landed in the city with a precautionary swine flu mask on. I was just following the guidelines as it came out in the media It was just a precaution. Please dont raise a hue and cry over it as it may scare people, he advised before signing off.

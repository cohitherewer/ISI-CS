                                                   Seedings, groups unclear
    - Champions Trophy
  -   Will the ICC stick to March 2008 rankings or effect a change?             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: The much-postponed sixth edition of the Champions Trophy will finally be held, in South Africa, between September 24-October 5, but its not clear whether the seedings and groups put in place before the postponement would remain or be amended.         
	The troubled edition was to have been hosted by Pakistan, between September 11-28 last year, but got postponed and eventually relocated. The seedings and groups were decided as many as 12 months ago, based on the ODI rankings of the International Cricket Council (ICC) on March 12, 2008.         
	I suppose well probably need to have a relook, but we havent made any decision as yet, Dave Richardson, the ICCs general manager (cricket), told The Telegraph on Tuesday evening, 24 hours after the executive board confirmed South Africa as the new host for the eight-team tournament.         
	Earlier in the day, an ICC spokesman had declined to comment, saying he first needed to get a clarification from the men who mattered the most.         
	It would, however, be very unusual (absurd, really) for a major event to be based on the rankings of a year-and-a-half ago. Richardson conceded that unusual bit, but the executive board will have to endorse any change.         
	Going by the rankings of March 12, 2008, the seedings and groups have been as follows:         
	 Group A: Australia (1), India (4), Pakistan (5), West Indies (8).         
	 Group B: South Africa (2), New Zealand (3), Sri Lanka (6), England (7).         
	If the same standard is adopted, but with a new cut-off date  March 16, 2009, marking the change in host  then the seedings and groups are going to be very different.         
	Australia and India would find themselves in group B this time, with South Africa and New Zealand in A. Here goes:         
	 Group A: South Africa (1), New Zealand (4), Pakistan (5), West Indies (8).         
	 Group B: Australia (2), India (3), England (6), Sri Lanka (7).         
	Except for Pakistan and the West Indies, the ICC rankings of the other teams in the top-eight have changed in the past year. Indeed, theres been much traffic on that ladder.

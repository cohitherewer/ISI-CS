The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harrington stays optimistic
                                                   Harrington stays optimistic
                      
	Turnberry (Scotland): Irelands Padraig Harrington believed he was still capable of completing a rare hattrick of British Open titles, despite flirting with the cut line in Fridays second round.         
	The world number 14 carded a four-over-par 74 in difficult, windy conditions on Turnberrys Ailsa Course, finishing right on the projected cut at three-over 143.         
	I wasnt thinking about making the cut, three-time Major winner Harrington told reporters after making his only birdie of the day at the par-five 17th. I was thinking Im eight shots behind (the leader). Thats not insurmountable on the weekend on a links golf course, especially like this.         
	The early lead was held by little-known American Steve Marino, who fired a 68 for a five-under aggregate of 135.         
	Harringtons biggest reason for optimism was the progress of his game after working hard with swing coach Bob Torrance.         
	Ive changed three things in my backswing and three things on my downswing, and I started off trying to change one. I think some of the stuff I worked on here at the start of the week definitely could be the last piece of the jigsaw in what Ive been trying to do, he said.

            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Jockey C. Alford was in his elements, winning five races in Wednesdays six-event card, including the feature event, 1,200m Delhi Race Club Cup, which he won astride Afforce. In the process, the jockey also helped trainer Vijay Singh lead in four winners and one for Harvinder Singh Bath who went on to notch up a double.          
	Alfords riding on the 5-2 fancied runner, Afforce, was a treat to watch. The jockey was quick to anticipate the tiring leader Queen Of Hearts distress. It prompted him to switch the course for a free winning run.

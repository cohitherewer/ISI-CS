The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | DareDevils face Mumbai Indians
                                                   DareDevils face Mumbai Indians
                      
	East London: It would be interesting to see what strategy the Delhi DareDevils take when they take on the win-hungry Mumbai Indians, eager to bounce back after two straight defeats, in the Indian Premier League here Friday.         
	The DareDevils, who climbed to the top of the table after whipping the Kolkata Knight Riders by nine wickets, would have to up the ante when they take on Sachin Tendulkars army for the first time in the tournament.         
	The Delhi side have played the least number of matches (seven) so far but have garnered maximum points (10) in the eight-team event that has already staged 34 of its 59 matches. Mumbai lost the plot while chasing against the Deccan Chargers Thursday, but going by the composition of their team, it wont be as easy for the DareDevils as their previous match.         
	The Mumbai side boast of an attacking opening pair in Tendulkar and Sanath Jayasuriya, well supported by South African swashbuckler Jean-Paul Duminy in the middle order. Their bowling looks equally impressive with Sri Lankan Lasith Malinga, off-spinner Harbhajan Singh and West Indian Dwayne Bravo in their ranks.         
	However, it remains to be seen if pace spearhead Zaheer Khan, who is nursing a shoulder injury, gets fit for the match.         
	Among the youngsters, Dhawal Kulkarni and Pinal Shah also impressed with both ball and bat against the Chargers. But despite the impressive line-up, Mumbai are second from bottom with just three wins from eight matches.         
	For the Delhi side, their key batsman Gautam Gambhir, who also stood in for injured captain Virender Sehwag, was back among the runs after an indifferent start to the tournament. Tillekaratne Dilshan also demonstrated his form in their last match against the hapless Knight Riders.         
	The DareDevils may consider fielding Glenn McGrath in place of Dutch-born Dirk Nannes Friday. (PTI)

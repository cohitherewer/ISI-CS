The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Test of Indians bench strength 
                                                     Test of Indians bench strength 
                  Sandeep Singh                     
	Kuantan: Defending champions India will test their bench strength when they face minnows Bangladesh in the sixth-seventh ranking play-off encounter of the Asia Cup hockey here on Thursday.         
	After their 2-3 defeat against arch-rivals Pakistan, India needed an outright win against China in their last group match Tuesday to progress to the semi-finals.         
	But all what the Sandeep Singh-led side managed was a 2-2 draw to see their title defence go up in smoke.         
	Disappointed with the performance of his wards, Indias coach-in-charge Harendra Singh said he would give the reserve players a chance in the Thursday match.         
	For the first time in eight months I didnt achieve the target I had set. So, I will try out my bench strength tomorrow. I need to test the reserve strength also, a dejected Harendra said.         
	Hari Prasad, VS Vinaya and Ajitesh Roy will play tomorrow, he added.         
	The winner of the India-Bangladesh match will face Japan in the fifth-sixth place play-off match on Friday. We cannot take any international team lightly, whether its Bangladesh or anyone else. We have to come out of our defensive mindset.         
	We have to play attacking hockey and there is no other alternative, he said.         
	Indias forward line, comprising Rajpal Singh and Prabhjot Singh, has been inconsistent in the tournament so far, squandering innumerable opportunities.         
	Thursdays match against Bangladesh thus gives them an opportunity to salvage some reputation.         
	Even though Sandeep converted two of the four penalty chances against China, the Indian captain has been less than impressive, missing as many as five drag-flicks against Pakistan.

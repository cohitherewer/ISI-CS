                                                   Medical officer awaits answers
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: A medical officer with the Sports Authority of India (SAI), who had filed an application under the Right to Information (RTI) act last month alleging rampant corruption within the organisation, is yet to receive any reply from the authorities.         
	Patiala-based Dr Sajib Nandi, who was mercilessly beaten up by miscreants earlier this month in front of SAI, Patiala, had filed an 18-page application under the RTI act, raising 144 questions.         
	Dr Nandi sustained damage to the right eye and was referred to the Post Graduate Institute Hospital in Chandigarh for further treatment.         
	The local police in Patiala have initiated an enquiry into the incident.         
	According to sources, the SAI officials are now trying their best to hush up the matter.         
	SAI has now adopted new tactics, sources said.         
	Now the plan is to delay as much as possible in replying to Dr Nandis questions.         
	They are also looking for a suitable clause to deny Dr Nandi the information.         
	At the same time some top officials are even plotting a move to sack the doctor.         
	S.S. Chabra, the principal information officer in charge of the enquiry, when approached, refused to talk saying he was busy.

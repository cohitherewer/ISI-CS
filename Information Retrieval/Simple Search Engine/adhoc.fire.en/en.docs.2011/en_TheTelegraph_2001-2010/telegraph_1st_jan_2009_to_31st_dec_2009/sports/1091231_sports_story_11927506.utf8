The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We havent lived up to hype: Smith
                                                                                                                       7                                      We havent lived up to hype: Smith
                      
	Durban: South Africa will not be panicked into making sweeping changes after their innings defeat to England on Wednesday, captain Graeme Smith said.         
	England bowled South Africa out for 133 in their second innings to complete an innings and 98-run win and take a 1-0 lead in the four-match series.         
	After a remarkable 2008, in which they won 11 of their 15 Tests and took first place in the world rankings, South Africa have lost four of their six Tests this year.         
	Its clear in our heads what we need to look at, those areas in which we are not up to standard. Its obviously been a disappointing year and we have not lived up to the hype of 2008, Smith told a news conference.         
	We reached a certain point, but we havent been able to take it to the next level. We need to look at why we havent done that, we need to reassess and make 2010 a better year.         
	But its important to take the emotion out of the decision making. Weve now got a crucial Test coming up in Cape Town and we need to make the right decisions to win that game.         
	Its important to have a wakeup call, we were outplayed and it just wasnt good enough, but it was one collapse and, as disappointing as it is, Im not a big believer in calling for mass changes.

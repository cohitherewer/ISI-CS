The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IFA blasts Mohun Bagan
                                                   IFA blasts Mohun Bagan
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Indian Football Association (IFA) secretary Utpal Ganguli on Monday blasted Mohun Bagan, at the governing body meeting, for the clubs controversial comments questioning the integrity of the state association.         
	Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra had lashed out at the IFA saying that their decision on the Snehasish Chakraborty-East Bengal row was fixed.         
	Snehasish was fined Rs 2 lakh for his false allegations against East Bengal.         
	Bagans allegations against me and the IFA on the whole are not only baseless, but it is an outright insult on the integrity of the parent body too.         
	I wouldnt tolerate anyone questioning the credibility of the IFA Either they will have to substantiate their allegations with valid proof or else they should apologise and withdraw their comments, fumed Ganguli.         
	He also challenged the Bagan brass saying: If they can prove their allegations, I give my word that I will resign from my post.         
	If the big clubs of the city react in such a manner whenever a decision goes against them, it will be difficult to take any independent decisions in future, he added.         
	The governing body also decided, unanimously, that the IFA would issue a letter to Bagan seeking clarification on their comments before they decide on the next step.         
	However, Mitra refused to budge saying they have certain documents that can leave the association in an uncomfortable state.         
	We will wait for their letter before deciding on our move, but we do possess certain documents which can make the IFA uncomfortable.         
	Meanwhile, the IFA secreatry revealed that they were working on a model contract which would plug the loopholes in the present procedure.         
	According to Ganguli, the draft should be ready by mid-October when he plans to sit with the representatives of the city clubs.

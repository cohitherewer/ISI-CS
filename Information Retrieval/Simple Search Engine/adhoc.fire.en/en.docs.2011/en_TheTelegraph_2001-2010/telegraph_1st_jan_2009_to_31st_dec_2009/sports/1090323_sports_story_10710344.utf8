The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Briefs
                                                                                                                                 
	 Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) Sunday announced a change in the umpire appointments for the last three matches of the one-day International series between the West Indies and England in the Caribbean.     
	Due to personal reasons, Aleem Dar will return to Pakistan after Sundays ODI in Guyana and will be replaced by Steve Davis, from the ICCs elite panel. The other appointments remain unchanged.          
	 Berlin: The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) agreed Sunday to make their top events more TV friendly, with shorter finals-packed evening sessions that are aimed at winning back younger viewers. It said the schedule changes would come in by the 2010 World Indoor Games in Doha.    
	Athletics, like the Olympic Games, has been suffering from an ageing viewership with younger audiences turning to shorter forms of sport for entertainment.        
	 Mumbai: Force India owner Vijay Mallya said that his team were hoping they would have introduced the required developments to their new car by the European leg of the championship to earn their first ever points.    
	Mallya was speaking at an event hosting Force India drivers Giancarlo Fisichella and Adrian Sutil en route to Australia for the season opener in Melbourne.         
	New Delhi: Babubhai Panocha set a national record in 20 km walk with a timing of 1hr 24min 31sec in the Asian Race Walking Championship held at Nomi City, Japan.     
	Babubhai finished seventh in the event but his effort bettered Sucha Singhs 21-year old record of 1:25:44.         
	 Sao Paulo: Ronaldo wants to score at least 30 goals for Corinthians by the end of the year.    
	The ideal would be to play one game a week ....and score at least 30 goals, the 32-year-old striker said.    
	It will not be easy ... but we will do the best we can. Thirty is a good number ... a good target.    
	Ronaldo, who signed a one-year contract with Corinthians late last year, made his debut for the team on March 4, playing 28 minutes. He played again four days later and started for the first time on March 11, scoring in a 2-1 win over Sao Caetano in the state championship.          
	 Stuttgart: Vitaly Klitschko retained his WBC heavyweight crown by defeating Cuban Juan Carlos Gomez on a technical knockout in the ninth round on Saturday.    
	Ukrainian Klitschko, who retired in 2005 after a series of injuries before reclaiming the WBC title in October by beating Samuel Peter, had to work hard to beat the bloodied Gomez.

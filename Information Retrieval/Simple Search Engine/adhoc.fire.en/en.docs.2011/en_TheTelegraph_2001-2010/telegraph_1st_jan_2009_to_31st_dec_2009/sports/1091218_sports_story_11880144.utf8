The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav likely to open in domestic one-dayers
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sourav likely to open in domestic one-dayers
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly will, in all likelihood, open the batting for Kolkata Knight Riders in the third edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) starting March 12. With Brendon McCullum unavailable due to New Zealands series against Australia, which ends March 31, the former India captain is likely to open along with Chris Gayle of the West Indies.         
	As part of the preparations for IPL, Sourav is also likely to open for Bengal in the East Zone one-dayers in Cuttack, next February. Although these are 50-over matches, Sourav will have enough scope to get into the groove.         
	Sourav will be certainly playing in Cuttack and it will be up to him to choose his batting order, one of the members of the senior selection committee told The Telegraph.         
	Skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla was also game for Sourav opening for Bengal.         
	I have absolutely no problem with Sourav opening. He is free to choose his batting position, said his KKR teammate. Sreevats Goswami is likely to partner Sourav at the one-day meet.         
	It has also been learnt that KKR are interested in the West Indian duo of pacer Kemar Roach and hard-hitting batsman Kieron Pollard for the next round of auctions. England all-rounder Luke Wright is also on the KKR radar.         
	As for the third days play in their Ranji Trophy Super League tie Thursday, Shukla lamented that they didnt have a fifth bowler to attack Delhi.         
	It was so painful to stand in the middle for so long. The breathing problem was very much there. I could hardly bend while fielding. But something inside me told me that I shouldnt leave the field.I only wish that we had a good fifth bowler today, Shukla lamented.         
	He, however, was all praises for his bowlers who had to toil hard on a dead pitch.         
	Full credit to Ranadeb (Bose), (Ashok) Dinda, Sourashis (Lahiri) and Iresh (Saxena) as they had a tough time bowling on this flat track, Shukla added.         
	Delhis hero Puneet Bisht was happy that he could contribute when his side were in trouble.         
	I have played well with middle-order and lower-order players. Batting with tailenders makes me all the more determined to do well, said the wicket-keeper.

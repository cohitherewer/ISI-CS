                                                   Moles: We have been outplayed
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hamilton: New Zealand coach Andy Moles admitted on Friday that his wards had put up a shoddy performance on the first three days of the first Test against India.               
	The following are excerpts         
	New Zealands position in the Test         
	We find ourselves in a very difficult position. To be honest, we have been outplayed for the first three days of the contest. We have to make sure that we come and show some character over the next two days.         
	How does he rate this performance?         
	Hands up. We just had a chat about it now. Weve underperformed, dropped four catches, there were balls in the outfield that we should have cut off. It often happens when youre under the pump and such great players are playing well. But no excuses, weve got a bit of personal pride and we were poor in performance.         
	If the team has any motivation left         
	Certainly. For a start, weve got to save the game. Weve just spoken. Ive let the guys know that we need to start doing the basics for longer. We havent bowled well for long periods. We havent batted well in pairs for long enough. In the field, weve been sloppy. Not a very good advert for the Test team so far in this game.         
	If some hard words were said in the dressing room         
	Hard words tonight. It will be kind words tomorrow.         
	Tim McIntoshs dismissal         
	You all saw it on TV, and yes, were disappointed but its part of the game unfortunately. Tim is trying to make his way in the game and hes desperately disappointed. Its one instance out of numerous amounts of cricket played over the last three days and weve not been good enough. When youre not good enough, things dont seem to your way. We have to get better and then things will go our way.         
	Are all the bowlers fully fit?         
	Iain has a slight side strain. He came off to make sure it doesnt get any worse. He had good treatment today (Friday) and well have a look again tomorrow (Saturday) to make sure it doesnt stiffen up.

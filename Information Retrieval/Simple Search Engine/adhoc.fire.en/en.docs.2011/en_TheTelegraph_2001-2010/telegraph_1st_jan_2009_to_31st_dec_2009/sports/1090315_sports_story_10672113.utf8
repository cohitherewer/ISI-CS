The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India face Pak test in final
                                                   India face Pak test in final
                      
	Johor Bahru: India will rely on the form of their drag-flickers when they take on archrivals Pakistan in the final of the Genting four-nation under-21 hockey tournament here on Sunday.         
	The Indians have maintained an all-win record in the tournament so far and their 3-1 victory in the last match against Pakistan should put them in good stead for the summit showdown at the Taman Daya stadium.         
	Coach A.K. Bansal is confident of his wards putting up a good show in the final. We are ready to take on Pakistan. We have played well so far and there is no reason why we cant put it across our rivals tomorrow, Bansal said.           (PTI)

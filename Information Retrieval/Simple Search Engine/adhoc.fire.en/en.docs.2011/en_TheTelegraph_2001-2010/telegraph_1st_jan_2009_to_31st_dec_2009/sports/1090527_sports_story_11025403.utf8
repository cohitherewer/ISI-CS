	Birmingham: The West Indies miserable tour of England continued Tuesday when they were beaten by 58 runs in the third and final one-day International at Edgbaston.         
	The defeat condemned the visitors to a 0-2 defeat in the series and having lost the preceding Test series by the same margin, Chris Gayles side go into next weeks Twenty20 World Cup at one of their lowest ebbs. It was a convincing display by England, whose opponents seemed unable to choose between chasing a target of 329 or avoiding humiliation.         
	England posted a daunting total of 328 for seven after being put into bat by the West Indies captain Chris Gayle.         
	Matt Prior made 87 off 86 balls and captain Andrew Strauss made 52, as England posted their highest ever ODI score at Edgbaston. Jerome Taylor was the pick of the bowlers, taking three for 59.         
	West Indies have only twice scored 300 or more in ODI history and their reply got off to a sorry start. (AP)

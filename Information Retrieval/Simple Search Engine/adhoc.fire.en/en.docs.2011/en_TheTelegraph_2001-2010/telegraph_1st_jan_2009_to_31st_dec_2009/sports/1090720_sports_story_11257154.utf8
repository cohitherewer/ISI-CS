The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SL wary of Pak turnaround
                                                   SL wary of Pak turnaround
                      
	Colombo: Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara is wary of a Pakistan comeback in the final Test of the series, acknowledging the visitors capacity for sharp form turnarounds.         
	Sri Lanka has an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three match series, with the final Test starting Monday.         
	Pakistan will be both trying to recoup some pride with a win, and to gain some momentum heading into the upcoming one-day International series.         
	Pakistan has always been temperamental as a side, Sangakkara said Sunday. Thats the greatest danger about them. We dont know what to expect when we walk out on to the field.         
	The thought always at the back of our heads is that these guys are such a great side that one of these days they are going to come back and come back hard at you. (AP)

                                                   India maul Bangladesh
                      
	Kuantan (Malaysia): India vented their frustration of missing out on a semi-final berth on Bangladesh, thrashing the minnows 11-1 in the fifth-seventh classification match of the Asia Cup hockey tournament here Thursday.         
	Captain Sandeep Singh (10th, 13th minute), S.V. Sunil (48th, 57th) and Sardara Singh (66th, 69th) scored two goals each while Hari Prasad (34th), Arjun Halappa (39th), V Raghunath (43rd), Rajpal Singh (65th) and Prabhjot Singh (67th) found the target once each. India will now lock horns with Japan for the fifth-sixth position on Friday.         
	Already out of contention for a semi-final berth after losing 2-3 to Pakistan and drawing 2-2 with China, the Indians toyed with their opponents with most of the action confined to the Bangladesh half. The eight-time Olympic champions found the net at will  thrice in the first half and eight times after the lemon break.         
	Sandeep converted two penalty corners in the 10th and 13th minutes and then Hari Prasad added one more goal to see India go into the breather with a 3-0 lead. After the change of ends, Halappa scored a field goal and then Raghunath converted a short corner four minutes later to make the scoreline 5-0. Hardworking Sunil joined the party soon and came up with a pair in the 48th and 57th minute.         
	Sardara was not to be left behind. The midfielder scored two beautifully worked out field goals, the last of which came just a few seconds before the final hooter. A goal each also came from the sticks of strikers Rajpal and Prabhjot.

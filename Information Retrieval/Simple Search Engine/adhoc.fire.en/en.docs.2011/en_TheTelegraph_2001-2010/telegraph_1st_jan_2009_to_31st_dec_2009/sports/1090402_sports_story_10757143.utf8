The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan firm favourites
                                                     Bagan firm favourites
  - I-League Medio James Singh feels Churchill-Vasco match was fixed       A STAFF REPORTER            Mohun Bagans Jose Ramirez Barreto (left) watches coach Karim Bencharifa (centre) juggle with the ball as Marcos Pereira looks the other way during a practice session at the club ground on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: If Karim Bencharifa is to be believed, Mohun Bagan are not thinking much about the I-League standings or Churchill Brothers these days. He is more worried about Thursdays I-League clash against Vasco Sports Club to be held at the floodlit Barasat Stadium.         
	We are not bothered about who is doing what or who have a chance of winning the title. Our focus is on Vasco and nothing else. I have told the boys to go out and play their normal game.         
	If we start thinking about the title, the pressure will take a toll on us, the Mohun Bagan coach said after a practice session on Wednesday under the blazing April sun.         
	So far, so good.         
	Now, as you prod him, the real picture comes out. He still thinks Mohun Bagan are in with a chance, and how improbable it can be to win the I-League. His belief probably comes from the fact that Churchill have a history of crumbling at the death.         
	Whether losing out to JCT (first National League) or pipped at the post by Mohun Bagan (sixth National League) or finishing second best to Dempo in goal difference (last year), the Goan team have always crumbled at the death.         
	Bencharifa says it may be due to their inexperience to deal with pressure-cooker situations. There are some talented players in their ranks but when it comes experience there is a definite shortage. I think a player like Dipak Mondal will handle pressure well than, say, L. Robert, was how the Moroccan, who himself was the coach of Churchill for the last two seasons, saw it.         
	So what does Bagan have to do from now on? They have 37 points from 19 matches and need to win their remaining ties. After that they will hope that Churchill lose to Mohammedan Sporting in their last match. All these permutations and combinations will, however, mean nothing if Bagan stumble in one of their matches. After Vasco, they have two tough assignments  one against Dempo (at home) and the last match away to Mahindra.         
	Coming back to Thursdays win, unless something miraculous happens, Agostino Diass boys should be easy meat for Bagan. The Goan team is already relegated, having managed only 10 points from 20 matches and conceding 42 goals in the League. They also have to face the ignominy of conceding nine goals against Churchill.         
	Bagan midfielder James Singh though found something fishy in that result. I have a feeling that match was fixed. You have to play very badly to concede nine goals. And Churchill, giving their desperation to win the title, can go to any extreme. So dont expect us to score that many goals on Thursday, James said.         
	Mohun Bagan are likely to bring in Habibur Rahman in place of Rahul Kumar, who got a start against JCT in Ludhiana. The kick-off is at 6.30 pm.

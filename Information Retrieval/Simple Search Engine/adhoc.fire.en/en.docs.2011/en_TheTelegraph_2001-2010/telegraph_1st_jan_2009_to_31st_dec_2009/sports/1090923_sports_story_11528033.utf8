                                                     Quitting caused rift: Flintoff
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Flintoff                           
	Andrew Flintoff says announcing his Test retirement plans midway through the Ashes series caused a rift with Englands team management.         
	After the drawn first Test at Cardiff, Flintoff decided to retire from Tests at the end of the series. He went public with that decision before the second Test at Lords.         
	I didnt really want to reveal my decision just before the final Test at the Oval and have some big send-off. I was keen to get the news out there so everyone knew, writes Flintoff in his forthcoming autobiography, which is being serialised in an English daily.         
	Andy Flower and Andrew Strauss were concerned about the announcement causing a distraction before the Lords Test and were hesitant about the timing at first.         
	The more I talked to them about it, though, the more they came around to my way of thinking. It was obviously going to be big news for a few days but I thought that could actually help the team  all the attention would be on me rather than them, writes Flintoff.

  - Second test Sri Lanka to miss Damika Prasad; Dhoni declared fit to play         KUSHAN SARKAR                                    
	Kanpur: Mahendra Singh Dhoni is not very fond of taking trips down the memory lane. Rather, he is someone who believes in living in the present.         
	However, when the Indian captain walks out for the toss with Sri Lanka counterpart Kumar Sangakkara, two little but significant statistics are sure to make him feel good before the start of the second Test match of the Jaypee Cup at Green Park on Tuesday.         
	It was against South Africa at this very ground some 17 months ago that Dhoni made his debut as Test captain and led his side to victory inside three days on a rank turner that drew a lot of flak from the ICC.         
	Also, the last time that India lost a Test match at this venue was 26 years back against the West Indies (late Malcolm Marshall ripped through the top-order) in 1983.           
	Even though these facts and figures count for little in the actual context of the match, the 22-yard strip at Green Park is sure to keep the Indian captain in a positive frame of mind. Add to it, the relief of being able to play in the match after doubts on Sunday evening due to a finger injury that made the BCCI rush Dinesh Karthik in as cover.   
	Not only did the skipper do all the customary keeping drills but also looked pretty comfortable facing the likes of Zaheer Khan, Sreesanth and Amit Mishra for about 40 minutes at nets.         
	Poor Karthik. He may well go down in the record books for the shortest sojourn with the national squad. Flown in as cover for Dhoni Sunday evening, Karthik along with teammate S. Badrinath was heading back to the airport in the afternoon to take the 1:30pm flight to Dharamsala where Tamil Nadu play Himachal Pradesh in the Ranji Trophy.         
	If Dhonis injury was a primary concern, the pitch at Green Park is no less a worry.         
	After the run-feast in the first Test in Ahmedabad, which ended in a yawning draw, the last thing either side wants is another placid and lifeless track.         
	If one goes by the greenish tinge in the wicket there will be certainly something for the seamers on all five days and it can be safely called a result-oriented one.         
	Also, a drop in temperature here would mean that the pitch is likely to have adequate moisture on all five days.         
	Curator Shiv Kumar assured that the pitch will hold for five days and also assist the spinners on the last two days. Also, according to the Indian captain, the rough outfield will take the shine off the ball quickly and one may expect a bit of reverse swing too.         
	The left-arm seamers in either side  Zaheer Khan and Chanaka Welegedara  will definitely be interested in such conditions.         
	Ishant Sharma is still favourite to retain his place in the squad although Sreesanth, who was seen bowling flat out at the nets at a decent pace, looked pretty impressive.         
	Similarly, left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha looked a far better bowler during the net session than leggie Amit Mishra. It will be interesting as to who becomes Harbhajan Singhs spin partner as the Green Park pitch is known to offer a lot of turn in the closing stages.         
	Harbhajan skipped the net session on the day as it was an optional one. It was learnt that he has a slight throat infection and chose to rest.         
	The opponents will however miss pacer Damika Prasad who is yet to recover from hamstring injury. Dilhara Fernando may get a look-in although Sangakkara didnt rule out the option of using Ajantha Mendis as the third spinner along with Muthiah Muralidharan and Rangana Herath.         
	The good news for the visitors is that Tillekaratne Dilshan, who sustained a fracture in his nose, is fit to play.         
	Teams         
	India (likely): Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, VVS Laxman, Yuvraj Singh, M.S. Dhoni, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Sreesanth/Ishant Sharma, Amit Mishra/Pragyan Ojha.         
	Sri Lanka (from): Tillekaratne Dilshan, Tharanga Paranavitana, Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene, Thilan Samaraweera, Prasanna Jayawardene, Dilhara Fernando, Rangana Herath, Thilina Kandamby, Nuwan Kulasekara, Angelo Mathews, Ajantha Mendis, Muttiah Muralidharan, Kaushal Silva, Chanaka Welegedara.         
	Match starts: 9.30am

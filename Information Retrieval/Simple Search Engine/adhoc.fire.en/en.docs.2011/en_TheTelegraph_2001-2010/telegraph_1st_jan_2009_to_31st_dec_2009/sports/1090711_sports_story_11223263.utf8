	Mohun Bagan on Friday sent three letters to the Indian Football Association (IFA). In one letter they have asked for a copy of Bhaichung Bhutias letter to the AIFF where the striker has sought the federations intervention to resolve the crisis between him and the club. The club officials have requested a quick solution to the Snehasish Chakraborty dispute in another letter.       
	Bagan, in their third letter, have enquired about the IFAs stand on releasing players for the national team. We still are not sure what the IFA has decided on this issue. We need a clear picture before the season starts Then we can plan accordingly, a official said.                 
	 Syed Rahim Nabi has alleged that East Bengal has forged his signature and is unnecessarily creating problems instead of releasing him. He claimed that his contract with the club is over. Club secretary Kalyan Majumdar has rubbished Nabis allegation saying that the player should talk to the club. If he has anything to say he should come straight to us, he said.

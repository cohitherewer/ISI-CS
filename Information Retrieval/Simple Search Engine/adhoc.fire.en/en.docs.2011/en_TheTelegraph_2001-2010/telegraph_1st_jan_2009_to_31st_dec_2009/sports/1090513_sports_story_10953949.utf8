The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warne out with injury
                                                   Warne out with injury
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Kimberley: Defending champions Rajasthan Royals were dealt a massive blow as captain-cum-coach Shane Warne was Tuesday ruled out of the Indian Premier League (IPL) for the next 10 days owing to a hamstring injury.         
	The Australian was injured while batting in their defeat to the Deccan Chargers Monday night and will be out of action for the next 10 days, making him unavailable for the rest of the teams campaign unless his side make the final.         
	However, the Royals said in a release Tuesday that Warne was working with the team doctor and that they will have more information in the next 24 hours. Shane Warne strained his hamstring in the match played against the Deccan Chargers in Kimberley on Monday.         
	He is currently working with the team doctor and we will have more information in the next 24 hours.         
	South African captain Graeme Smith is most likely to lead the team in Warnes absence. The Jaipur-based outfit need to win all their remaining games to make the semi-finals and Warnes absence would severely hurt the teams hopes of advancing to the knock-out round, especially in the wake of two successive losses.         
	Besides, the team have also lost pacers Kamran Khan and Amit Singh due to suspect bowling action.         
	The Royals director of coaching Darren Berry has reportedly said: I think it is the balancing act that we have to get right.         
	We can field just four overseas players and it is a difficult thing to manage. We have now put ourselves under pressure.

	Wellington: A report states that New Zealand cricketers Neil Broom and Aaron Redmond had caused a riot while in India with their A team in August, for which they were detained by the Chennai police.         
	According to the report, the duo broke the team curfew and went out for a drink after which they withdrew money from an ATM and started distributing it among passersby triggering off a full-scale riot that needed police intervention.

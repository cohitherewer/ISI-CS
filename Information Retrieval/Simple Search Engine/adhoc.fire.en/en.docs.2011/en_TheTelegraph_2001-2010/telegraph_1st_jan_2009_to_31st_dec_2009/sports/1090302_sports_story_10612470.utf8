The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ogilvy, Casey   in title round
                                                   Ogilvy, Casey   in title round
                            
	Marana (Arizona): Former winner Geoff Ogilvy reached the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship final for the third time in four years with a commanding 4 amp;2 victory over American Stewart Cink on Saturday.         
	The Australian world number eight overpowered his semi-final opponent with an explosive run on the back nine, going birdie-birdie-eagle from the 13th before sealing the win with a conceded birdie on the 16th green.         
	Champion at La Costa in 2006 and a losing finalist against Swede Henrik Stenson in 2007, Ogilvy will meet Paul Casey in Sundays 36-hole final.         
	Casey, like Ogilvy a resident of nearby Scottsdale, beat fellow Briton Ross Fisher 2 amp;1 in a match of poorer quality on a sun-baked afternoon at Dove Mountains Ritz-Carlton Golf Club.         
	Thats the best I played all week by a long way today, a smiling Ogilvy told reporters after extending his win-loss record at the event to 16-2.         
	I was a lot sharper. I hit the ball great off the tee, I hit some good iron shots and made some good putts.         
	I knew I had to be all there this morning against Rory, added the Australian, who beat British teenager Rory McIlroy 2 amp;1 in the quarter finals earlier in the day.         
	Hes in form and one of the best young players in the world. Stewart this afternoon, again in form, one of the best players in the world, so two pretty satisfying guys to beat.         
	Ogilvy won the opening hole against Cink after the American drove into the desert scrub and needed two more shots to reach the fairway.         
	The Australian went two up after sinking a 12-foot birdie putt at the par-five second before his opponent clawed one back at the fourth.         
	Although Ogilvy restored his two-hole advantage when Cink bogeyed the fifth after hitting his approach into a bunker, the American levelled the match by the 11th.         
	He birdied eight and was conceded the par-five 11th after Ogilvy ended up under the lip of a fairway bunker off the tee and was only able to advance the ball 90 yards with his next shot.         
	Ogilvy regained control with consecutive birdies from the par-five 13th, getting up and down from just short of the green before rolling in a 13-footer at 14 to go two up.         
	The Australian struck a dagger blow at the 343-yard par-four 15th, driving the green and knocking in a six-foot eagle putt to forge three ahead before sealing victory at the following hole.         
	In the second match, Fisher bogeyed the par-four first after his tee shot ended up in desert waste, and also the par-three sixth after finding the front greenside bunker.         
	Trailing Casey by two, the Englishman cut the deficit in half when he sank a five-foot birdie putt at the par-five eighth.         
	Fisher again dropped two behind when he bogeyed the par-five 13th after overshooting the green with his third shot.         
	Both players double-bogeyed the par-four 14th before Fisher trimmed Caseys advantage to one by sinking a 17-foote birdie putt at the 16th.         
	However, Casey finally ended the match in champion style, rolling in a 15-footer to birdie the par-four 17th.         
	Ross played some very good golf closing in and I was under pressure, said Casey, a nine-time winner on the European Tour. So I feel very satisfied to hole that birdie putt.

            A STAFF REPORTER            England captain Charlotte Edwards celebrates with the World Cup in Sydney on Sunday. (AP)                           
	Calcutta: Fast bowler Nickyi Shaw responded magnificently to a last-minute call-up, starring in Englands thrilling four-wicket victory over New Zealand in the final of the ICC Womens World Cup at the North Sydney Oval on Sunday.         
	Later, Caroline Atkins top-scored with 40 runs as England won their third World Cup, after 1973 and 1993, reaching the winning total of 167 for six with 23 balls remaining.         
	Earlier, they dismissed New Zealand for 166 after the Black Caps won the toss and elected batting.         
	The 27-year-old Shaw replaced Jenny Gunn, who aggravated a calf strain during her teams warm-up.         
	Her figures of four for 34 from 8.2 overs were her best in one-day Internationals.         
	Having already done the business with the ball Shaws side needed her to pitch in with the bat also late in the game. With 18 runs required and four wickets standing, she took control of the situation and hit a priceless 17 not out from 23 balls with two fours to complete an outstanding day that earned her the player-of-the-final award.         
	Holly Colvin hit the winning runs for England, after they were made work hard of the run-chase slipping from 74/0 to 149/6.         
	England captain Charlotte Edwards said the win was a big relief. Its a really special moment and Ill treasure it for the rest of my life, said Edwards. We were up against a very good New Zealand team and they never gave up.

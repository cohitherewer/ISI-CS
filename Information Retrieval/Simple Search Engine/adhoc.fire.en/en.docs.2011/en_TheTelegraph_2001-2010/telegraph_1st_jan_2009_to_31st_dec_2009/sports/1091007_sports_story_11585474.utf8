The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies retain No. 1 spot
                                                   Aussies retain No. 1 spot
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The ICC Champions Trophy concluded Monday with Australia humbling a hapless New Zealand in the final to reaffirm their status as the best in the business. As a plot within the plot in the 13-day cricketing extravaganza, which began September 22, unfolded a dramatic chase for the top spot in the ODI rankings with India, Australia and South Africa enjoying the honours in turn.         
	The Aussies cemented their place at the top as they opened a 4-ratings points gap with second-placed India, who now have 124 ratings point, in the ICC rankings issued Tuesday. South Africa are No.3 with 121 ratings points.         
	The curtains went up with the very first match when hosts and favourites South Africa were beaten by Sri Lanka and the Proteas, who went into the tournament ranked No.1, slumped to third. India, who were No.2 at the start of the tournament, moved to the top of the table while Australia were placed at No. 2.         
	But it was a brief stint for Mahendra Singh Dhonis men as their 54-run defeat to Pakistan three days later cost them their No.1 place and they moved down to No.3.         
	Ricky Pontings side climbed up the ladder to No.1, pipping Graeme Smiths side by virtue of having accumulated more points.         
	But calculations once again came into play as India, whose Champions Trophy campaign progressed no further than the group stages, were in with a chance to reclaim the top spot had England beaten Australia in the semi-finals. But that didnt happen as the Aussies easily outclassed Andrew Strausss men.         
	As of Tuesday, New Zealand have moved up to fourth, thanks to their impressive run in the tournament, with other semi-finalists Pakistan and England being placed at 5th and 6th respectively.         
	India skipper Dhoni continued to be the top one-day batsman followed by his deputy Yuvraj Singh. But Sachin Tendulkar dropped a place to ninth.

                                                   East are favourites: Devang
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Devang Gandhi, who led East Zone to the Deodhar Trophy title in 2003-04, strongly believes that Manoj Tiwary and his men will enjoy the upper hand when they face West in the final in Cuttack on Wednesday.         
	I am very optimistic about East coming out in flying colours tomorrow. The way they have played the tournament is really impressive, the former Bengal and East Zone captain told The Telegraph from Cuttack on Tuesday.         
	Incidentally, East Zone won all their matches on way to the Deodhar Trophy title in 2003-04.         
	Both the openers Wriddhiman (Saha) and Natraj (Behra) are providing good starts. The middle order is also very sound and both the opening bowlers  Ranadeb Bose and Ashok Dinda  are bowling well. They are having a good start irrespective of whether they are bowling or batting. I feel it will be the same for them (East) tomorrow and I am looking forward to it, Devang said.         
	The 37-year-old Bengal senior selection committee member, who is in Cuttack on a personal visit, will be at the Barabati to witness the final on Wednesday.         
	The side winning the toss should bat first and a total above 250 will always be competitive, felt Devang.         
	Devang was all praise for East captain Manoj Tiwary. He has done a very good job. His man-management skills are very good and he (Manoj) has been quite impressive.         
	What would be his advice to Manoj and his men for the final? They should stick to the basics and should not try anything extraordinary, said Devang.

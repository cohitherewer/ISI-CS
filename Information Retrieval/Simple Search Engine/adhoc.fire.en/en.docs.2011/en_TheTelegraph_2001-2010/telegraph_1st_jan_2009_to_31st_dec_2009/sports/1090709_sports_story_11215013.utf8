            CRICKET BRIEFS                
	Karachi: The ICC Champions Trophy meet has been advanced by two days and will now be played from September 22 to October 5 in South Africa this year.         
	The ICC advanced the dates on the recommendations of some member countries who wanted a proper break for their players between matches. The ICC has also decided that the meet would be restricted to two venues, the Wanders in Johannesburg and Centurion in Pretoria.         
	They will not be much travelling for the teams as both venues are not far from each other, a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official said.         
	The Champions Trophy was earlier scheduled to be held from September 24 to October 5.         
	BCCI sanction         
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has not given an approval for a T10 Gully cricket tournament, as is being claimed by the organisers of the same. According to a BCCI release, no current or former player registered with them should associate himself with the event.         
	Jhulan slips         
	 Calcutta: Rumeli Dhar returned to the top five of the Reliance Mobile ICC ODI Womens Player Rankings for all-rounders while captain India captain Jhulan Goswami was replaced by England spinner Holly Colvin as the top bowler in the latest rankings according to an ICC release on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Mithali Raj was replaced by Englands Sarah Taylor as the No. 2 batswoman on the list.         
	Qadir criticism         
	 Karachi: Former chief selector Abdul Qadir has slammed the Pakistan team for their humiliating defeat in the first Test against Sri Lanka at Galle, calling it shameful and an embarrassment to national cricket.         
	This is what happens when you indulge in favouritism while picking players. A national team must be selected only on merit, Qadir said.         
	Akram praise         
	 New Delhi: Senior batsman Mohammed Yousuf, who cracked a century on his comeback match for Pakistan after severing ties with the Indian Cricket League (ICL), still has lot to offer, feels former captain Wasim Akram.         
	Yousuf scoring a ton in his comeback Test is a way of telling the selectors that how great a player he is. A player like him cannot be kept out of the team, he said.

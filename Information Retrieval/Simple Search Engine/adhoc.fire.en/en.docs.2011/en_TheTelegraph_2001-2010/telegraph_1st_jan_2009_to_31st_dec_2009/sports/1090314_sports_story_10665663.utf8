	Auckland: India may opt to rest some of their key players as they go into the fifth and final one-dayer against a demoralised New Zealand here Saturday, hoping to finish off on a winning note a series they have already won.         
	The Indians have taken an invincible 3-0 lead in the five match series and will be keen to try out their reserve players for the inconsequential game at Eden Park.         
	Sachin Tendulkar, who sat out in the last game because of an abdomen injury, is set to be rested for this match so that he is fully fit for the Test series beginning March 18.         
	While things have gone favourably for the Indians, the hosts have only pride to play for as they desperately need to salvage a win to convince the home fans of their potential in limited overs cricket.         
	However, India coach Gary Kirsten has made it clear that he was in no mood to take the game lightly and would like to carry forward the momentum of the ODI series in the three upcoming Tests.         
	It is important to maintain momentum and win. That might require us to use our best combination. We also need to be mindful of the fact that it might be an opportunity to rest one or two players. We just have to weigh what we want to do but we havent decided yet, Kirsten said.         
	India are set to make some changes in their playing eleven and, in all probability left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha and Irfan Pathan are likely to get a game before they return home along with Yusuf Pathan, Praveen Kumar and Rohit Sharma.         
	This will come as an ideal opportunity for Ojha to win the selectors confidence. A poor show in the match, however, would allow Ravindra Jadeja, who has the makings of a competitive all-rounder, to stake claim for the second spinners slot.         
	The Indian team management is also likely to give Zaheer Khan a break before the Test series and draft Irfan in his place.         
	Teams         
	India (likely): Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (Capt.), Rohit Sharma, Yusuf Pathan, Praveen Kumar, Harbhajan Singh, Ishant Sharma, Zaheer Khan.         
	New Zealand (likely): Jesse Ryder, Brendon McCullum, Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, Jacob Oram, Peter McGlashan, Grant Elliott, Daniel Vettori (Capt.), Ewen Thompson/Scott Styris, Kyle Mills, Iain Brien.         
	Match starts: 6.30 am (IST). (PTI)

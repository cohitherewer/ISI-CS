The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | NZ to host Pak home series
                                                   NZ to host Pak home series
                            
	 Karachi: Security concerns have forced Pakistan cricket administrators to shift a December home Test series against New Zealand to New Zealand. New Zealand were supposed to tour Pakistan this winter but due to security concerns they informed us it would not be possible for them to send their team. Instead they offered to host the matches as home Tests for Pakistan to which we have agreed in principle with minor details to be worked out. Depending on time we could play three Tests maximum and two minimum, one source said.  
	Officials resign  
	 Hyderabad: The turmoil in the Andhra Cricket Association (ACA) continued with two of its vice-presidents quitting Wednesday. Close on the heels of the sacking of V. Chamundeshwarnath as general secretary, A.K. Khan, additional DGP (law and order), and M.V.G.K Bhanu, special secretary to the chief minister, resigned. They have sent their resignations to chief secretary P. Ramakant Reddy, urging the state government to take over the reins of the association.  
	Watson injury  
	 London: Australia all-rounder Shane Watsons latest injury is not as bad as first feared, team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said Wednesday. The injury-prone Watson was ruled out of Australias Ashes tour opener against Sussex at Hove, starting Wednesday, with what appeared to be a knee problem. But following a scan Tuesday, Kountouris said: We expect his (Watson) injury should resolve fairly quickly, his return to play will be guided by progress made in the next few days. Victorias Brad Hodge would be among those in line if Australia felt they had to summon an extra player.  
	Bravo deal  
	 Melbourne: The West Indies all-rounder Dwayne Bravos exploits in the recently-concluded World T20 in England and the IPL have fetched him a deal with Cricket Victoria for their upcoming Twenty20 Big Bash campaign. However, the deal would materialise only if the West Indies Cricket Board gives the green signal as the competition clashes with West Indies Test and one-day series against Australia.  
	Assault charge  
	 Melbourne: Former Australia opener David Boons son, Jack, could face assault charges over an on-field clash during an Australian Rules Football match in Tasmania. North Hobarts Daniel Newitt had his nose broken in a collision with Clarence player Jack Boon during a Tasmanian State League match last month. Jack was not reported by the umpire. AFL Tasmania, after reviewing footage of the clash, concluded that Jack was attempting to tackle and Newitt had slipped, and it decided against referring the matter to the leagues tribunal. Newitt then complained to the police.  
	Tour confirmed  
	 Harare: Zimbabwe Cricket on Wednesday confirmed Bangladeshs tour to the country for five one-day Internationals between August 5 and 19. All the matches will be played in Bulawayo, Zimbabwes second largest city. Zimbabwe last played an ODI series in February in Kenya, whitewashing the hosts 5-0.           AGENCIES

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC: PCB is not properly advised
                                                   ICC: PCB is not properly advised
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive officer Haroon Lorgat Tuesday lamented the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB)s attitude towards the world governing body ever since being stripped of the 2011 World Cup matches due to security reasons.         
	In my view, they (PCB) are not being advised properly. We could have engaged in dialogue and sorted out all issues. There is no need for legal means, Lorgat told reporters at a function to unveil the 2011 World Cup logo here.         
	The PCB has threatened legal action against the ICC after it was stripped of its hosting rights in the quadrennial event due to the volatile situation in the country. The 14 matches that Pakistan was to host have been distributed among the other three hosts  India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.         
	Although the PCB kept away from Tuesdays meeting of the World Cup central organising committee, Zakir Khan, its director of cricket operations, was present to attend the logo-launch function.         
	Lorgat said that the 2011 edition would be shorter than the previous two tournaments but said the exact duration of the event  which could be between 40 and 45 days  was still being worked out.         
	The ICC chief clarified that the venues that host Pakistans share of matches would not be given any additional fees.         
	Ratnakar Shetty, the chief administrative officer of the BCCI and the 2011 tournament director, said the other three boards didnt have any qualms about Pakistan still pocketing its share of hosts fee despite not holding any matches.

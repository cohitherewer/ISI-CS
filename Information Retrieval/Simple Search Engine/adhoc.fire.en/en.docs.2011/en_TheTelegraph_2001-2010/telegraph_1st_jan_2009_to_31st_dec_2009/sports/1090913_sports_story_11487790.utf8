The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fiery Brett Lee seals series
                                                   Fiery Brett Lee seals series
                      
	London: Brett Lees five for 49 reduced England to 220, and Australia cruised to a seven-wicket victory at Lords on Saturday to take an unassailable 4-0 lead in the one-day series.         
	Michael Clarke hit an unbeaten 62, Tim Paine 51 and Ricky Ponting 48, to ease Australia to a winning score of 221 for three with 6.2 overs to spare. With the series now decided, Australia have the chance for a 7-0 triumph, which would be some kind of a consolation for losing the Ashes series.         
	Already 3-0 up with four matches to go, the Australians, who removed the last five England wickets off 21 balls, hit back strongly after England raced to 96 for one inside the first 19 overs and captain Andrew Strauss gave the home team a solid platform with 63.         
	The Australians slowed the scoring rate with spinner Nathan Hauritz taking two for 23 off 10 overs, although Lee, bowling some devastating yorkers, was the big star as the tourists wrapped up the series with three matches to go.         
	Recalling batsman Joe Denly, pacer Stuart Broad and leg-spinner Adil Rashid, England got off to a quick start after Strauss won the toss for the fourth time in a row, and opted to bat first. The openers raced to 28 off the first four overs before Denly edged one from Lee to first slip Cameron White, and departed for 11.         
	Hitting Nathan Bracken for three fours in one over, Strauss attacked the Australian bowlers from the start and pulled Shane Watson for his eighth boundary to reach his 18th one-day 50 off 55 balls. Ravi Bopara tried to sweep and was out lbw to Hauritz for 26. (AP)

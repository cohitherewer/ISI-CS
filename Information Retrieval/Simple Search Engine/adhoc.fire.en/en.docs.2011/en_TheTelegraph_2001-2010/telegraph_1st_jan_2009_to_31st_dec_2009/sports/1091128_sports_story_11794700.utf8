	Kanpur: When Pragyan Ojha dismissed Sri Lankas No.11 batsman Chanaka Welegedara off his own bowling here Friday, Mahendra Singh Dhonis boys completed a historic century.         
	India humiliated Sri Lanka, beating them by an innings and 144 runs in second match of the Jaypee Cup, and in the process, won the 100th Test for the country.         
	Incidentally, Indias first ever Test win was also an innings victory. The side led by late Vijay Hazare had beaten England by an innings and eight runs in 1952 in Chennai (then Madras).         
	The Indian victory also dashed the Lankan dream of winning a Test series in India. At best, they can level the series, winning the Mumbai Test, which starts on December 2.         
	With four top-order batsmen already back in the pavilion, batting out two full days to save this Test was next to impossible for the hosts when play started Friday.         
	 It was never a matter of how, but when India would wrap up the proceedings.         
	Thilan Samaraweera (78) defied the Indian attack for some time with a gutsy performance, but that was never going to be enough.         
	The fate of the match had been decided once the visitors conceded a first-innings lead of 413 runs. On a slow turner, where the ball was occasionally keeping low, it needed solid technique to withstand an Indian attack which looked menacing.         
	Samaraweeras partnerships with Prasanna Jayawardene and Ajantha Mendis, which were worth 61 and 73 respectively, only delayed the inevitable.         
	Kumar Sangakkara and his boys will have to do some serious thinking about their batting.         
	The pitch was admittedly difficult to bat on, but one cannot deny that the Sri Lankans played too many shots when they should have concentrated on batting out time.         
	Even on the fourth day, Angelo Mathews and Prasanna, two recognised batsmen, lacked the application shown by Mendis. The spinner (27) hung around for 88 minutes and played 75 deliveries.         
	One expected Mathews  Lankas new ODI and Twenty20 sensation  to provide support to Samaraweera. However, Mathews batting suggested he was chasing a stiff target in a T20 match.         
	The wily Zaheer Khan sorted him out with a couple of bouncers. The first one hit him on the chest guard as he tried to evade the delivery without looking at it.         
	He wasnt lucky on the second time though. He tried to hook it without being in a position for the shot. Rahul Dravid took the catch, running to his right from gully.         
	Prasanna was bowled by a classical off-break from Harbhajan Singh, that pitched on the off and then went through the Lankan wicketkeepers bat and pad.         
	This victory will be significant for captain Dhoni in more ways than one. With Ishant Sharmas dip in form, Zaheer was missing a potent new-ball partner.         
	Man of the Match Sreesanths devastating spell in the first innings will definitely make the Indian captain believe that he has options to choose from.         
	Pragyan Ojhas (four wickets in the match) performance is also heartening. The selectors, as well as the team management, may feel now that they have a back-up left-arm spinner, who can be used as to keep things tight.         
	The only worry for the team, going into the third Test, will be the absence of Gautam Gambhir, who has opted out due to a personal reason.

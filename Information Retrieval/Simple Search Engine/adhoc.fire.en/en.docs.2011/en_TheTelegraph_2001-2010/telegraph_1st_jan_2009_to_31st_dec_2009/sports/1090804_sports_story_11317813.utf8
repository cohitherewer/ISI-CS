The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI aid sought   for AIFF project
                                                   BCCI aid sought   for AIFF project
            JAYDEEP BASU                            
	New Delhi: The acting president of the All-India Football Federation (AIFF), Praful Patel, has sought the help of his Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) boss, Sharad Pawar, for the Indian football teams preparations for the prestigious Asian Cup to be played in January 2011.         
	Pawar and Patel are also colleagues in the Manmohan Singh government.         
	According to sources, Patel has requested Pawar, the immediate past president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), to ask the cricket Board to provide a one-time financial aid for the AIFFs ambitious Goal 2011 Project.         
	Under the Goal 2011 Project, around 25 top Indian footballers will be kept exclusively for national duty for nine months and will not be allowed to play for their respective clubs till the end of the Asian Cup campaign.         
	Sources also revealed that the cash rich cricket body is likely to grant Rs 10 crore to the AIFF, provided the proposal is cleared by the BCCI working committee in its next meeting.         
	During this nine-month period, the Indian footballers will play a series of international matches to prepare themselves for the Doha meet. The AIFF will also pay the footballers the contract money they were supposed to receive from their clubs.         
	Since the football federation requires a huge amount of money to make this project a success, the BCCI may help it at the request of the AIFF acting president Praful Patel, sources said.         
	Patel is believed to have held informal discussions with Pawar a few days ago regarding the matter.         
	Pawar, who promised to look into the request sympathetically, has reportedly asked the AIFF to submit a detailed proposal.         
	Sources confirmed that a senior AIFF functionary visited Mumbai last week for this purpose.         
	A final decision on this subject, however, will only be taken in the BCCIs next working committee meeting.         
	Previously, the cricket Board had decided to come forward for the promotion of other sports and sanctioned Rs 50 crore for the endeavour.         
	The BCCI has already handed over the entire amount to the ministry of youth affairs and sports.         
	Although it is now a well known fact that the marketing and broadcasting partners of the football federation are not making timely payments as per the contract, the AIFF acting president has managed to bring in cash from other sources.         
	Recently, the sports ministry had sanctioned Rs 10 crore for the Asian Games preparations.         
	The ministry is also likely to bear a part of the cost for the Goal 2011 Project.

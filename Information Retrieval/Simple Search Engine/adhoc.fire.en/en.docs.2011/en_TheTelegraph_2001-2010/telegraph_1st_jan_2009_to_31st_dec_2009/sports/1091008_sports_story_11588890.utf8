The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Silly mistakes cost us   the match: Bhowmick
                                                   Silly mistakes cost us   the match: Bhowmick
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                            
	Mumbai: Coach Subhas Bhowmick was a proud man despite East Bengals loss to Mahindra United at the Cooperage here on Wednesday.         
	I am happy with our performance considering we had no practice before the match. Actually we dominated except for a few silly mistakes that cost us the match, Bhowmick said.         
	The coach heaped praises on Yusif Yakubu, the lone foreigner so far this season. You cant deny that he is one of the best in the country, particularly given the fact that he has just arrived (in India) and took the field without any kind of practice. Hats off to him, Bhowmick said.         
	Mahindra coach David Booth said he was content with his teams show.         
	Actually we didnt play well, in terms of the way I wanted to. It was not the standard that we expected of ourselves. But we deserved to win because we were the better team, the Englishman said.         
	Booth admitted the team failed to keep Yakubu in check.         
	(Bhaichung) Bhutia, for all his brilliance, is not someone who runs around with the ball ... But Yakubu, our defence was a bit slow to pick him, he said.

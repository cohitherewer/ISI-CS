The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan dangle cash carrot
                                                   Bagan dangle cash carrot
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan redefined their thirst for the I-League title on Monday, as the century-old club reportedly announced a cash reward of Rs 5 lakh for Mohammedan Sporting if they manage to beat title contenders Churchill Brothers on Thursday.         
	Bagan take on Mahindra United in the capital on the same day, but a victory for the green and maroon brigade may not be enough if Churchill win against Mohammedan Sporting.         
	Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra declined comment on the issue saying: I wouldnt like to officially speak on that. Mohammedan coach Shabbir Ali though expressed his displeasure at the offer: We are not bothered about what they are saying.         
	Meanwhile, Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa said the crowd at the Barasat Stadium had a big hand in their victory over Dempo SC on Sunday.         
	Speaking on the I-League title, Karim said: I am ambitious but a very realistic person too. Churchill are in a better position to clinch the title. But I am not even thinking about that. We have had a wonderful season. Im proud of my team, Bencharifa said.

	Christchurch: Former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming has ruled out taking over as the next New Zealand coach.         
	Even though Flemings name, along with that of former India coach John Wright, was doing the rounds, Fleming himself shot down the idea.         
	It is not my interest to coach internationally. I am very happy with the business side of things I am looking to set up, and with my family life, he told a radio channel. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chandhok wants the real thing
                                                   Chandhok wants the real thing
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Karun Chandhok was cool in his reaction to reports that he has got an opportunity with Force India F1 to train using their simulator.         
	It would be a great opportunity to work with Force India in a simulator but it doesnt change the reality. At the end of the day, it is (Vitantonio) Liuzzi who will be racing the car and not me, Chandhok told The Telegraph Thursday from Monza, Italy.         
	People back home are really excited about this simulator talk but nothing has been finalised.         
	I discussed it with Vijay Mallya briefly, a couple of months back. Thats where it stands.         
	The simulator is not a major step at all. Modern simulators are very sophisticated but it is only virtual and you cant judge a driver from it.         
	Force India F1 principal owner Vijay Mallya said Thursday that his team would give Chandhok an opportunity to work with his their simulator.         
	Chandhok, who is currently racing for Ocean Racing Technology in the GP2 Series, said he was looking at opportunities, including from teams other than Force India, to race in F1 next year.         
	My main aim is to be racing in F1 next year. If its with Force India it would be fantastic, but if opportunity comes my way to race for some other team, I will have to take it, the 24-year-old Chennai boy said.         
	If I have a choice between racing in F1, being in the simulator or being a test driver with Force India, definitely I will take the first because its racing that matters if you are a driver.

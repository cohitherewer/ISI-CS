            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      - A Telegraph special 
  -  Two former captains pick their Dream XIs                                         Ravi Shastri      
	Calcutta: Ravi Shastri, a former India captain and a member of the 1983 World Cup-winning squad, picked his Dream ODI XI for The Telegraphs readers.         
	Shastri, incidentally, has also served as a stand-in cricket manager.         
	The following is Shastris line-up, specific to India, in batting order:         
	SACHIN TENDULKAR: His record speaks for itself... I dont need to elaborate.         
	SOURAV GANGULY: Struck a terrific opening combination with Sachin and there was a four-year period (from about 1997) when he played sublime cricket.         
	VIRENDER SEHWAG: One of the greatest impact players produced by the country... Can do the job, whatever the conditions.         
	MOHAMMED AZHARUDDIN: Very difficult to contain when in full flow. Also, by far, our finest all-round fielder.         
	YUVRAJ SINGH: Probably one of the best strikers of the ball anywhere... A genuine match-winner, who can turn a match on its head rather quickly.         
	MAHENDRA SINGH DHONI: To balance the egos in the XI, Id get him to captain... Hed be the wicket-keeper... Again, a genuine match-winner.                     Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar    
	KAPIL DEV: Our finest all-rounder, perfectly suited for the one-day game.         
	JAWAGAL SRINATH: A very fine bowler... Could be fast when needed and had the ability to reverse swing and bowl the yorkers at the death.         
	ZAHEER KHAN: Has the ability to bowl at the death, too... Has the ability to reverse swing.         
	ANIL KUMBLE: A tremendous competitor and he would be deadly accurate... Was the kind of bowler any captain would want.         
	HARBHAJAN SINGH: Good competitor, with an excellent temperament.         
	12th man: Ravi Shastri!         
	The last word...         
	Its a team to challenge the best in any part of the world... Would be great on the park.

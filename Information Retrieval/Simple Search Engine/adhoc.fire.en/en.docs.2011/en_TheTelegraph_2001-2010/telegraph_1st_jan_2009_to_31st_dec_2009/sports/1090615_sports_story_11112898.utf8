    Worcester: India leg-spinner Piyush Chawla smashed his maiden first class hundred to help Sussex reach a dominant position against Worcestershire on the third day of their County Championship Division One match here on Sunday. Chawla, who signed this week as a temporary replacement for Pakistan rsquo;s Yasir Arafat, was unbeaten on 102 as Sussex declared on 620 for 9, a first innings lead of 332. Coming out to bat at number nine, Chawla cracked seven fours and six sixes in 95 minutes of exhilarating hitting, his second fifty coming in mere 28 balls.

    Lawson on Lee
    Melbourne: Former Australia cricketer Geoff Lawson has rated Brett Lee as the country rsquo;s last-choice bowler and said the inclusion of the pacer in the Ashes squad may prove costly for Ricky Ponting rsquo;s side when the five-Test series commences in July. Lawson feels that the 32-year-old Lee rsquo;s current form is not up to Test standard and he could prove a liability in Australia rsquo;s bid to avenge their 2005 Ashes loss in England.

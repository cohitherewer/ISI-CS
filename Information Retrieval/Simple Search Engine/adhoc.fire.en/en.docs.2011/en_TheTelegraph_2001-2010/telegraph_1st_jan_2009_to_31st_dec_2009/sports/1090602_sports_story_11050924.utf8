The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal look to play safe
                                                     Bengal look to play safe
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Coach Raghu Nandy (centre) with Bengal players                           
	Calcutta/Chennai: Bengal coach Raghu Nandy is a worried man before his boys start their Santosh Trophy campaign against Tamil Nadu in a group A league match in Chennai on Tuesday.         
	Tamil Nadus impressive run in the preliminary round has become a cause of concern for Nandy. The hosts topped cluster VIII scoring 30 goals from four matches.         
	Tamil Nadu are playing well and have a good side, the best Ive seen in some years. Though they have mostly played the minnows in the prelims, they have shown fine rhythm.         
	On the other hand, we are playing our first match and so, we should be on our toes to beat them tomorrow, he said.         
	We dont have the luxury of playing some weaker team so as to settle into rhythm. But we had a month-long preparatory camp with rigorous training.         
	The players are prepared both mentally and physically, Nandy added.         
	The Bengal coach rued the absence of the likes of midfielder Syed Rahim Nabi (down with chicken pox) and Chirag United striker Shankar Oraon, who had a collarbone injury.         
	The hosts, on the contrary, with six I-League players in their ranks, including captain Kalia Kulothungan, N. Mohanraj and Prem Kumar, are a confident lot. They could prove to be tough nuts in front of their home crowd and Bengal are well aware of that.         
	They have very good players in the side. Their confidence level is high and with the likes of Kulothangan, Suresh, Mohanraj, I expect a tough match tomorrow. We really need to play positive football. We have no room to relax, Nandy said.                   
	Talking about his team, Nandy, however, admitted the weaknesses in the striking zone.         
	If you compare the two teams, I think we are slightly weak in the forward department. But Im confident of the players who are at hand, Nandy emphasised.         
	Bengal will play Manipur in their next match on Thursday followed by the Punjab-match two days later on Saturday.         
	Meanwhile, defending champion Punjab coach Jagbir Singh guarded his teams chances before his team take on Manipur in the first match at Jawaharlal Nehru StadiumTuesday.         
	We have five-six new players in our team. I am pinning hopes on players like Anwar Ali (captain), Rakesh Masih and Balwant Singh. I will be rotating players among the available talents.         
	There is no point in talking about whether I miss star players. All the teams would be gunning for winning each of their matches. Likewise, we will go all out to win our third title in a row, he said.         
	Contrary to the preliminary stage, which had seen many a one-sided matches, most of the quarter final matches are expected to be tight contests with little room for complacency.         
	Punjab are clubbed with Bengal, Manipur and Tamil Nadu in group A while group B consists of Services, Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka.         
	Punjab, last years runners-up Services, semi-finalists Bengal and Karnataka have been given a direct entry into the quarter final league stage while Manipur, Tamil Nadu, Goa and Maharashtra made it to the last-eight stage from the preliminary round.         
	Services coach Ravinder Singh said his boys are in good spirits and would want to go one step ahead of their runners-up finish last year.

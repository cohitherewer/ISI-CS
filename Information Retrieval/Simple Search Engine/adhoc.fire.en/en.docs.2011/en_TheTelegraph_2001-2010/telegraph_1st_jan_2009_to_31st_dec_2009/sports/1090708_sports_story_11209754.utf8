The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Armstrongs team in the lead 
                                                     Armstrongs team in the lead 
                  Lance Armstrong                     
	Montpellier: Seven-time champion Lance Armstrong missed out on taking the Tour de France leaders yellow jersey by a fraction of a second after his Astana team won the fourth stage time trial on Tuesday.         
	Swiss Fabian Cancellara held a 40-second lead over Armstrong going into the stage, and that was the time by which Astana beat the yellow jersey holders Saxo Bank team, forcing race stewards to check the rule book.         
	The results of Saturdays opener in Monaco were taken into account, helping Cancellara retain the jersey he had seized in the Principality.         
	Its Swiss timing, said Cancellara who now has the same overall time as Armstrong. Astana completed the 39-km course in Montpellier in 46 minutes and 29 seconds, 18 seconds quicker than Garmin with Saxo Bank third.         
	Armstrong had put himself within reach of top spot in the previous stage to La Grande Motte, when he joined the decisive move, which finished 40 seconds ahead of the main bunch and many favourites, including his own team leader Alberto Contador.         
	Armstrong will have another chance to recover his favourite summer suit in Wednesdays 196.5-km fifth stage to Perpignan with long, windswept straights which could favour attacks.

                                                   Pak players plan to sue IPL, teams
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Karachi: Five Pakistani players, who played in the Indian Premier Leagues (IPL) inaugural edition in 2008, intend taking the IPL and the concerned franchises to court.         
	Pakistan captain Younis Khan (Rajasthan Royals), Shoaib Malik (Delhi DareDevils), Salman Butt, Shoaib Akhtar (both Kolkata Knight Riders) and Shahid Afridi (Deccan Chargers) have asked an agent to go to Mumbai and file a damages suit there in the High Court.         
	The cricketers, who were dumped by their respective franchises after the tournaments first edition, are unhappy as their contracts were cancelled prematurely and their dues were not cleared.         
	The agent represents Mohammed Asif and now he has also been approached by these players to help them file a case against the IPL in an Indian court, a Pakistan newspaper reported on Thursday.         
	The players feel the IPL was unfair in terminating their three-year contracts after the Pakistan government did not allow them to go to India because of the strained political relations between the two countries.         
	The IPL has now been shifted to South Africa and the players want the organisers to either allow them to play in the tournament or compensate them fully.         
	The players believe, since they didnt refuse to play in the IPL, the organisers should not have terminated their contracts at a short notice without clearing the dues, the report said.         
	Interestingly, the IPL and its franchises did not terminate the contracts of four other Pakistan players, Sohail Tanvir, Umar Gul, Misbah-ul Haq and Kamran Akmal.         
	Gul, in fact, has now asked the Knight Riders to increase his contractual fee as he was bought in the players auction last year for only $150,000.         
	IPL chairman Lalit Modi neither took calls nor did he respond to a text message from The Telegraph. A Delhi DareDevils spokesman also declined to comment on the issue.         
	A KKR official, when contacted, however, said that the franchise was not aware of any such incident and added that everything has been done according to the IPL rules.         
	The general mood among the franchises concerned, however, is that the matter is between the IPL and the players. The franchises, therefore, are not too concerned.         
	Mohammed Hafeez, another Pakistani player who represented the Knight Riders last year, only had a one-year contract with them while Asif has been released by Delhi DareDevils after testing positive in a dope test carried out in the league last year by the organisers. However, Asif has now got his dues and has no grievances.         
	The second season of the IPL kicks off in Cape Town on April 18.

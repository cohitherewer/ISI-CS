The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Stewards reject diffuser protest
                                                     Stewards reject diffuser protest
                              
	Melbourne: Race stewards rejected a protest Thursday against the bodywork on the cars of three teams racing at this weekends Formula One season-opening Australian Grand Prix.         
	Three teams  Ferrari, Renault and Red Bull  lodged protests after pre-event inspections approved the cars of Williams, Toyota and Brawn. The protest alleged the teams had broken new aerodynamic laws restricting the size of the rear diffuser.         
	After hours of hearings late into the night, the race stewards rejected the protest and cleared the three teams to race with their designs unchanged.         
	Following lengthy discussions with the various parties, stewards reiterated their belief that the cars are legal, FIA said in a statement.         
	That decision is expected to be appealed, which would require a hearing of the FIAs International Court of Appeal. That would be unlikely to take place until after next weekends Malaysian Grand Prix.         
	Even before the stewards hearing, the protesting teams had signalled their intention to appeal if the verdict went against them. Williams, Toyota and race favourites Brawn will compete in Australia and Malaysia with their current bodywork design but with the fear that any points gained may be wiped out if the appeal succeeds.         
	BMW team principal Mario Thiessen indicated an intention to join Ferrari, Renault and Red Bull in the protest, but the team did not make the deadline to do so.           (AP)

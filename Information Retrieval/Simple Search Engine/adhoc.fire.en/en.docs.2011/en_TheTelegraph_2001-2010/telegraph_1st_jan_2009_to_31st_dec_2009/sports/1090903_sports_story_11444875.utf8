                                                   EB open campaign today
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal will hope for a winning start when they take on Tata Football Academy (TFA) in their opening group match of the IFA Shield at the Barasat Stadium on Thursday.         
	If the boys manage to play 60 percent of what they had in Myanmar, we will log full points, coach Subhas Bhowmick said after a practice session at the club ground on Wednesday.         
	Bhowmicm rued that Lebanese Ramez Dayoub would be missed during the IFA Shield. Dayoubs International Transfer Certificate (ITC) is yet to arrive and the cpach will have to rejig his defence.         
	With no Dayoub, East Bengal have registered Brazilian Edmilson and Czech medio Jan Berger as foreign players. The red-and-golds will also be bolstered by the return of Syed Rahim Nabi and Mehrajuddin Wadoo.         
	Yes, its unfortunate that we will not have Dayoub  But I am hopeful that boys will play positive football. With Nabi and Mehraj around, we will definitely enjoy upperhand, the coach added.

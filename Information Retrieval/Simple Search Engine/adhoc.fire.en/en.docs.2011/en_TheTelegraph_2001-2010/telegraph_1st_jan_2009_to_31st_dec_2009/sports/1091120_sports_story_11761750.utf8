	Madrid: Spain marked their return to the Vienna stadium, where they won Euro 2008, by thrashing 10-man Austria 5-1 while Germany were held to a 2-2 draw by Ivory Coast in friendlies on Wednesday.         
	David Villa netted twice for the European champions at the Ernst Happel stadium, scene of Spains 1-0 final victory over Germany last year, to take his international goal tally to 35 in 54 appearances.         
	An injury-time goal from Lukas Podolski saved Germany in Gelsenkirchen and Giorgio Chiellini headed home as an experimental Italy side beat Sweden 1-0 in Cesena.         
	Austria, who failed to qualify for the World Cup, took a surprise lead through Jakob Jantscher on eight minutes but Cesc Fabregas levelled for Spain two minutes later.         
	Yasin Pehlivan was dismissed for a late challenge on Sergio Busquets in the 26th minute and Villa struck twice before the break.

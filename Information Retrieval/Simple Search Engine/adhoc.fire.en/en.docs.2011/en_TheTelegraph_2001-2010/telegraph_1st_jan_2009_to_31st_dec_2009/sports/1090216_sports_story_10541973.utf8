	Paris: Local favourite Amelie Mauresmo confirmed her return to form when she beat Russian third seed Elena Dementieva 7-6, 2-6, 6-4 to clinch her third Paris Open title on Sunday.         
	The Frenchwoman, who dropped to 24th in the WTA rankings after reaching top spot in 2004, ended a two hour-38-minute contest on her second match point.         
	In a tense opening set, Olympic champion Dementieva retrieved her opponents groundstrokes like clockwork and she was the first to hold serve to open a 4-2 lead.         
	Eighth seed Mauresmo, who won the tournament in 2001 and 2006, frustrated the Russian when she broke back in the 10th game and forced a tie-break.         
	The Frenchwoman saved a set point before prevailing 8-6 on her second chance with a service winner after 76 minutes.         
	She went on to break in the first game of the second set but Dementieva lifted her game and the 27-year-old Russian won five games in succession to level the tie.         
	With the backing of a 4,000 crowd, Mauresmo broke twice in the decider as Dementieva, who won the Auckland and Sydney tournaments this year, made a series of unforced errors.         
	The Russian pulled a break back but Mauresmo clinched victory with a service winner before bursting into tears.           (REUTERS)

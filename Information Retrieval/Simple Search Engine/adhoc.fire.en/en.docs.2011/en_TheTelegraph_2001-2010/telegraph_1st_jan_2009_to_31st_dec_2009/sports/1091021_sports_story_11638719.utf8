                                                   Series will be exciting, says White
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: All-rounder Cameron White predicted on Tuesday that it will not be easy to beat India in the forthcoming one-day series.         
	Speaking to the media on the eve of the Champions League semi-final, White, captain of Victoria Bushrangers, said: As Ponting said, the Indians will be very hard to beat on their home soil. I feel the same.         
	I think it will be a good, hard and exciting series between the two countries, White commented. The Indians will get the support of thousands, he said.         
	NSW Blues captain Simon Katich, however, felt Australia start favourites. They should be very confident after their great performances in England and South Africa. Moreover, because of the IPL (Indian Premier League), Australian players are familiar with the conditions here, he said.

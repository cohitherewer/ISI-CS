                                                   Another feather in Jeev cap
                                Jeev Milkha Singh      
	Sentosa: Ace Indian golfer Jeev Milkha Singh on Tuesday joined the likes of Vijai Singh and K.J. Choi as an honorary member of the Asian Tour for his contribution to golf in the region and across the globe.         
	I think its a great honour for what Ive done for golf in Asia. Im pretty excited that Ive been recognised for my achievements and I want to thank the Asian Tour and all the members for considering me for this recognition, said Jeev.         
	The 37-year-old has become one of the worlds leading players in recent years winning eight tournaments in Asia, Europe and Japan over the past three seasons.         
	He has also broken into the worlds top-30 and has won two Asian Tour Order of Merits in 2006 and 2008. Jeev was also the first golfer to surpass $1 million in earnings on the Asian Tour in a single season last year.         
	This is where I started from and I will never forget that, said Jeev.         
	I will always go back and support the Asian Tour. The way the Asian Tour has grown is fantastic to see. I feel and strongly believe that the Asian Tour will continue to grow and produce top-class players.         
	Jeev cut his professional teeth in Asia in 1995 and immediately showed his potential by finishing third on the Order of Merit.         
	Between five seasons, he won four titles before enduring a dip in form due to injuries.         
	The Indian went through several lean seasons before coming back with a vengeance in 2006 with a long-awaited victory in the Volvo China Open.         
	It sparked a superb revival in his game as he went on to win three times around the world and lift his maiden Asian Tours Order of Merit crown.         
	Last season also he won four times internationally, including the Barclays Singapore Open which saw him take his seasons earnings to $1.45 million and rewarded him with a second Order of Merit crown.         
	Asian Tour Executive Chairman Kyi Hla Han said he was delighted that Jeev accepted the honorary membership.         
	As one of the pioneers of the Asian Tour, Jeevs success story serves as a wonderful inspiration to many young players in Asia. He learned to compete and win on the Asian Tour and is now regarded as one of the worlds best players, he said.         
	Incidentally, Jeev scored a two-day total of 146 in the Augusta Masters last week to miss the cut  first time in three appearances. Jeevs first round score of 71 matched his last years first round.           (PTI)

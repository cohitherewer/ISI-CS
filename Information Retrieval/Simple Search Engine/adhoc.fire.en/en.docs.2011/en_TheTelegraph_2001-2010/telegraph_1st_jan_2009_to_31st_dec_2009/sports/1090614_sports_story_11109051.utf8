The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tendulkar says team is fearless
                                                   Tendulkar says team is fearless
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar feels that Team Indias recent success abroad have made the team a fearless unit capable of beating any side in the world.         
	Tendulkar said the process of winning matches abroad started in 2001 and since then India have beaten every team in the world in their own backyard.         
	I remember it was from 2000-01 when we started touring much better.         
	That is when we started winning matches abroad. South Africa, New Zealand, West Indies, England and Australia, we have beaten almost everyone one of them in their own backyard, Sachin told BBC Sport.         
	It did not happen overnight. It was a process. But, because of that (successes), we have started having that fearless approach. So now we are in a comfort zone, we are absolutely fearless but also sensible at the same time, Sachin added.         
	We have a fantastic team combination and that is why there have seen fantastic results, he added.         
	Sachin also feels that India have the balance in batting and bowling to win the World Twenty20 in England.         
	I am hoping that India win the World Cup because we have all the required ammunitions, he said.         
	 We have got an explosive batting, a well-balanced bowling attack and a fantastic captain.         
	We have the combination and strength. It is all about execution and I hope we play well and pull it off.         
	Sachin, who owns several batting records in Test and one-day cricket, said his only dream was to play for the country and win matches, and milestones that come along were secondary for him.         
	My biggest dream was to play cricket for India and play as long as possible. I did not play for records like         
	I will score 40 hundreds in Test and 40 hundreds in ODIs. I did not think of all these things.         
	I just wanted to walk out in the middle, score as many runs and win matches for India. I want to live that dream to the fullest.

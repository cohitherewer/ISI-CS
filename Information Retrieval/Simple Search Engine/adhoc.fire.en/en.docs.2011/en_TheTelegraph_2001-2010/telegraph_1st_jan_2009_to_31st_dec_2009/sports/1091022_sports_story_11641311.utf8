	Hyderabad: Trinidad and Tobago face their toughest challenge in Champions League Twenty20 so far, when they take on the in-form Cape Cobras for a final spot in the Champions League Twenty20, here Thursday.         
	The batting prowess of the Caribbean side has inspired awe, but they are up against a team who also have some really big hitters.         
	While Trinidad and Tobago are yet to be defeated in the event, Cape Cobras lost one in the league stage on a low and slow pitch against the Delhi DareDevils in their last League B match. But the wicket here at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium has been a batting paradise, best of all the three venues, and the kind of batting line-ups the two teams have, Thursdays clash should be a high-scoring affair.         
	Like Trinidad amp; Tobago, Cape Cobras batting is their strength. All their main batsmen, led by captain Andrew Puttick, who remains the only centurion of the tournament so far, are in supreme form.         
	The way South Africas new batting sensation JP Duminy has batted, Dwayne Bravo and company have their task cut out. (PTI)

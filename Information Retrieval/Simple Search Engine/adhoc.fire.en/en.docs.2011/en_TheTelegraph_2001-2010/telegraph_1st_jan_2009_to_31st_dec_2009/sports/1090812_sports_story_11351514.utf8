	Hyderabad: After the terror threat, influenza A (H1N1) scare has cast its shadow on the 17th World Badminton Championship, which began here Monday.         
	Geremy Gan, coach of the Malaysian team has displayed symptoms of swine flu and his samples have been sent for testing for the influenza A virus, organisers of the event said Tuesday.         
	Pullela Gopichand, director of the organising committee and the Indian team coach said We dont want to take any chances and we are taking all precautions.         
	The Malaysian coach has been quarantined at the Andhra Pradesh Chest Hospital, the nodal agency for H1N1 cases. The sick coach had been sharing a room with two other officials from the Malaysian team. They have been provided with precautionary treatment.         
	There has been a team managers meeting at noon Tuesday and all officials have been briefed on the issue.         
	It was learnt that there will be no screening of spectators at the World Badminton Championships because the officials feel there would be no interaction between them and players.         
	Dr K. Subhakar, state co-ordinator for swine flu, said the throat swabs of the Malaysian coach were being sent to the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD), Delhi and that the reports are expected Wednesday.         
	A player from Singapore was also admitted to a corporate hospital Monday evening due to ill health but doctors said he had no visible symptoms of swine flu.         
	Following the swine flu threat all officials and policemen at the sports venues have been advised to wear face masks. Nearly 325 players from 42 countries are competing in the six-day event.

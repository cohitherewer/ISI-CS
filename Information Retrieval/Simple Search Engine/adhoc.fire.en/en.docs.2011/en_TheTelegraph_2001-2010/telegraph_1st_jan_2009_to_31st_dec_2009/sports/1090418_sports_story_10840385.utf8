The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zaheer: India forced decision
                                                   Zaheer: India forced decision
                      
	Karachi: Exasperated at International Cricket Councils decision to drop Pakistan as a co-host of the 2011 cricket World Cup, former captain Zaheer Abbas alleged on Friday that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had a role in influencing the decision.         
	I dont believe that with India being in such an influential position in world cricket, the ICC could have decided to shift the World Cup matches from Pakistan without their support, Abbas said.         
	He said there was clear indication that India was behind a campaign to isolate Pakistan cricket after the Mumbai attacks in November last year.         
	Look at the way things have gone since the Mumbai incident. First they cancelled their tour to Pakistan. Then they tried their best to stop Sri Lanka from accepting our invitation and then influenced the Bangladesh Board to cancel our tour to Bangladesh last month.         
	They then did not allow our players into the Indian Premier League (IPL) and now this shifting of matches, Abbas said.         
	If India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh had wanted, I dont think the World Cup matches would have been shifted by the ICC, he said.         
	Abbas also lashed out at Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for not being able to stop ICC from taking this decision.         
	Nothing practical has been done to prevent this shifting of World Cup matches which will harm Pakistan cricket very badly and also hurt the future of the sport in Pakistan, he said.         
	Former Test pacer Sarfaraz Nawaz also had no doubt that India was responsible for the shifting of the Champions Trophy and World Cup matches from Pakistan.         
	Saleem Altaf, the chief operating officer of the PCB, said he had just heard about the news but had no details.         
	I dont know what has transpired at the ICC meeting in Dubai for this decision to be taken. But it is disappointing as we were keen to host the World Cup matches and were working hard on a security plan to convince the ICC and other countries, he said.         
	Javed Miandad, a former captain and the PCB director-general (cricket), said he was expecting this from the ICC.         
	Pakistan cricket is going through bad times and unfortunately the support and understanding we expect from the ICC and other countries is not forthcoming, he said.         
	Former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja said he was shocked at the ICC decision.         
	The World Cup is a global event and I dont think the Pakistani people will like this decision. How do you expect the sport to survive in Pakistan when the ICC is isolating Pakistan as a cricketing nation, he said.         
	Another former captain Moin Khan said he was surprised at the ICC decision.         
	What was Indias role in all this? Pakistan cricket has really suffered a big blow with this ICC decision, Moin said.         
	Rashid Latif said the PCB would have to be more proactive to stop from being isolated in international cricket.         
	Cricket cant survive without international matches at home. The security situation in other countries is also bad, including India, so why just keep on targeting Pakistan. The IPL was shifted from India because their government couldnt guarantee security for the players. So why is the ICC only targeting Pakistan?, he asked.         
	Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq has blamed the countrys Cricket Board for the ICCs decision of shifting the 2011 World Cup from the strife-torn nation due to uncertain security situation.         
	We had suggested to them (PCB) to invite a world eleven side by paying the players handsome amount. Wasim Akram and others even offered to use their contacts and arrange for the players but the Board didnt respond at all, Inzamam said.         
	 (PTI)

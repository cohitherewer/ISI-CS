The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pub visit led to exit: Symmo
                                                   Pub visit led to exit: Symmo
                      
	Melbourne: Catching a rugby league game at a pub with beer for company was the reason why he was dumped from Australias World Twenty20 squad, troubled all-rounder Andrew Symonds has revealed.         
	Symonds was sent home from England after breaking an alcohol-related team agreement, Cricket Australia had said at that time.         
	Opening up about the episode that also cost him his central contract with CA, Symonds said he went out to watch a rugby league match between NSW and Queensland at a pub after the practice match against Bangladesh and returned late, that too drunk.         
	I love Origin football and for me, with Origin football comes a few beers. I was wrapped up in watching football and then when I got back (from the pub) I knew then (my career was over), Symonds revealed in an interview to a TV broadcaster.         
	The 34-year-old said he felt caged-in and feared a mental breakdown due to his inability to cope with the pressure of being an international cricketer.         
	It takes it out of you, a little bit at a time. Then theres the build-up from that, and then, boom, Symonds said.

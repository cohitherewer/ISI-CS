                                                   Decision shortly: Sharan
            OUR BUREAU                      
	New Delhi/Calcutta: The All India Football Federation-appointed arbitrator, Amarendra Sharan is likely to submit his report on the Bhaichung Bhutia-Mohun Bagan dispute on Saturday.         
	Confirming this on Wednesday, Sharan, a former additional solicitor general of India, said he was currently studying the matter carefully. I hope to submit my report on Saturday.         
	Sharan also dismissed Bagans claims that the arbitration process was farcical and pre-planned and said: Bagans apprehensions are premature as I am yet to submit my report.         
	I feel that all claims made by Bagan are baseless. I am not against or for anybody. I am here to submit my impartial findings and it is up to the parties to accept it or not, said the arbitrator.         
	Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra hinted the club might take the Bhutia issue to Fifa if proper justice was not done.         
	We want justice and a fair ruling. But what is happening is a circus, Mitra said.         
	Meanwhile, Bhutia donned the East Bengal colours for the first time this season, albeit for practice, on Wednesday morning.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania is Mahesh choice for Slams
                                                   Sania is Mahesh choice for Slams
                      
	Kochi: Upbeat after his Australian Open mixed doubles win with Sania Mirza, Mahesh Bhupathi on Thursday said Sania would be his mixed doubles partner in subsequent Grand Slams this year.         
	Sania is playing great tennis. She hits the ball very hard and complements my kind of play at the net. We are always going to be a very dangerous mixed doubles team, Bhupathi said. (PTI)

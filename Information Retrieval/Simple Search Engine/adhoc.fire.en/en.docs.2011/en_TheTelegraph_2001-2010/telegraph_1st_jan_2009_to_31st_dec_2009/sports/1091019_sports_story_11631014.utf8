	Sao Paulo: Jenson Button clinched his first Formula One title with a fifth-place finish at the Brazilian Grand Prix on Sunday, taking advantage of mishaps by the other title contenders in a race won by Red Bulls Mark Webber.         
	Home favourite Rubens Barrichello, Buttons Brawn GP teammate and his closest contender, started from pole but finished only eighth after a puncture, while Red Bulls Sebastian Vettel was fourth.         
	The fifth place was good enough to give Button an insurmountable 17-point lead in the drivers standings ahead of the season-ending race in Abu Dhabi on November 1.         
	Its amazing, Button said. This race for me was the best race Ive run all year. I needed it.         
	Australian Webber took his second F1 win ahead of Robert Kubica of BMW Sauber and defending champion Lewis Hamilton of McLaren at the 4.3km Interlagos track. Barrichello had to win and hope Button finished fourth or worse, but failed in his attempt to clinch victory in front of his home crowd for the first time in his 17-year career.         
	Buttons triumph gives Britain back-to-back F1 titles for the first time since Graham Hill won in 1968 and Jackie Stewart in 1969. Hamilton won last year, also at the Brazilian GP.         
	Brawn GP also made history on Sunday, becoming the first team to win the constructors championship in its debut season. It hasnt sunk in yet, team principal Ross Brawn said. Itll take awhile.         
	Button started only 14th after a poor qualifying under heavy rains on Saturday, but he drove aggressively from the beginning to quickly move up the grid. He also took advantage of an eventful start in which several cars had problems ahead of him and dropped to the back of the pack.         
	He was up to ninth place after the safety car left the track on the third lap, and then he made bold passes to overtake the Renault of Romain Grosjean and the Williams of Kazuki Nakajima to move to seventh. Vettel also had a good race after starting only 15th, finishing fourth, but it was not enough to keep his title hopes alive.         
	All three title contenders got away cleanly, but the safety car was brought out before the first lap was over after a crash between Toyotas Jarno Trulli and Force Indias Adrian Sutil and Trulli immediately confronted Sutil after the incident.         
	In the pit lane, McLarens Heikki Kovalainen drove off before his refuelling hose had been detached, spilling fuel as he drove away with the hose still attached. When Kimi Raikkonen drove into the spilled fuel after changing his front wing, a fireball briefly ignited around his Ferrari, but fortunately he was able to continue.         
	Barrichello, starting from poll, led for the first part of the race but dropped out of contention after the first round of pit stops. He began the race with a lighter fuel load and the strategy proved costly. Nevertheless, he looked set for a podium finish until a puncture after touching wheels with Hamiltons McLaren forced him into another pit stop, ending his hopes of a home victory.         
	Webber, who won for the first time at the German Grand Prix earlier this season, took the lead after the first round of stops and dominated from there.         
	Fantastic day for the team to win again, Webber said. Defending champion Hamilton finished third after starting from 18th on the grid.         
	Today (Sunday) its been an extremely tough day, Hamilton said. To fight all the way up to third from 18th, its a great job for the whole team.         
	Button, Britains 10th Formula One world champion, defied his critics and made a boyhood dream come true on Sunday.         
	Written off by some in recent years as an overpaid one-hit wonder with playboy tastes, the Briton capped an extraordinary season with a title that ranks as one of the sports most astonishing turnarounds.         
	The 29-year-old Brawn GP driver lined up in Australia in March with just one win under his belt from 153 starts but with a dominant car that he would go on to describe as outrageous and a monster.         
	He went on to win six of the first seven races and laid the foundations for a championship that would elevate him to the same level as the likes of compatriots Nigel Mansell and Lewis Hamilton.         
	However, the boyhood dream had looked impossible at the end of last year when Honda announced they were pulling out of the sport, leaving Button and Barrichello both wondering where their careers were headed.         
	After his first season with Williams as a 20-year-old in 2000, a debut that promised great things, Button put his name to an autobiography entitled My Life on the Formula One Rollercoaster.         
	Neither he, nor father John who attends all his races as a jovial presence in the paddock, could ever have imagined the peaks and troughs that lay ahead.         
	Frank Williams had summoned Button, whose parents are divorced, to their first meeting by calling him on his mobile while the youngster was in a pub with friends. He swiftly made an impression.         
	Williams remains a strong admirer. I think he would without doubt be the most gentlemanly winner, with pretty much zero rough edges, he had said earlier this month. A regular nice guy who never throws a wobbly. Hes a gentleman, a well-balanced individual.

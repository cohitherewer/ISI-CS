The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spurs edge past Hull
                                                   Spurs edge past Hull
                                
	Hull: Jonathan Woodgate headed in an 86th-minute winner Monday to help Tottenham ease their Premier League relegation fears with a 2-1 victory at Hull.         
	Aaron Lennon gave Tottenham the lead in the 17th minute with his second goal of the season, but Hull equalised when defender Michael Turner scored in the 27th.         
	Woodgates powerful header from a short corner moved Tottenham up two places to 14th, one behind Hull and five points clear of the relegation zone.         
	In a hectic next seven days, Tottenham face Shakhtar Donetsk in the Uefa Cup on Thursday and then Manchester United in the League Cup final at Wembley on Sunday.           (AP)

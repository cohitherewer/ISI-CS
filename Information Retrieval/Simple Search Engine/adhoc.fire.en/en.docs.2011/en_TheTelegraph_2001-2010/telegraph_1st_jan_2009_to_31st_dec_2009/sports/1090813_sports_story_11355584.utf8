                                                   Fitness did not let KKR down: Leipus 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Australian Andrew Leipus, the Kolkata Knight Riders physiotherapist, believes lack of fitness wasnt an issue in the Calcutta-based franchises debacle in the last edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	I dont think that fitness was an issue But we are working on it this time, Leipus said on Wednesday.         
	Speaking on the ongoing KKR fitness camp at the Eden, the former Team India physio said: Fitness cant be gained overnight. We are presently monitoring the fitness levels of the players and assessing their current physical status.         
	They will also be informed about the potential injuries they might suffer according to their physical build.         
	We will be handing them individual programmes to be maintained during the lead up to the next IPL. It will also help them during the domestic season.         
	No special drills have been planned yet. Maybe we will do it in due course, he added.         
	Asked if more such camps would follow, he said: Of course But it will depend on whether we get any window where we can assemble the players.

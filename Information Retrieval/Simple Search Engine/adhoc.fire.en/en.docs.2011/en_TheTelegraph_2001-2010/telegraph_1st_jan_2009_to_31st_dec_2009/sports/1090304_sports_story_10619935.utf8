                                                   Happy we didnt tour Pakistan: Dhoni
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Tuesday expressed shock at the terror attack on the Sri Lankan cricketers and said that the Indian government had taken the right decision in cancelling the Indian teams tour to Pakistan in January-February.         
	I am glad I am in New Zealand. Now on, cricketers will be on alert. However, there is not much a cricketer could have done in a situation like that, especially when the whole convoy is attacked, said Dhoni.         
	I am happy that we didnt tour Pakistan. I am happy that the government didnt allow us to tour Pakistan. It may have happened to us or it may not have happened to us. But overall I am happy to be here.         
	I was right in the middle and was quite shocked to hear about it. It is sad that sportspersons are being attacked. Once a guy decides we have to attack the cricketers, we are not tough targets. Cricketers roam about freely while on tours. So you have to be aware.         
	The terror attack on Tuesday drew a response from Australia captain Ricky Ponting and the South Africa skipper Graeme Smith.         
	The following is what they had to say:         
	Ricky Ponting: On behalf of the Australian cricket team I would like to express our deepest condolences to those who have been affected by the tragic events in Pakistan this morning. An act of violence like this is a terrible thing and when it involves those who are part of our cricketing family, players the world over are affected. The wider cricketing community has been shocked by what has occurred and our thoughts and full support is with those involved. We have spoken with members of the Sri Lankan team this morning and made them aware we are extremely saddened by what has happened and that our best wishes are with them all. We hope that those who have been injured in these attacks can make a full and quick recovery and return to representing their country soon.         
	Graeme Smith: The word tragedy is often used to describe a setback on the sporting field, but this is a real tragedy, for all the people of Pakistan and Sri Lanka, for cricket, and for all decent people. There is a tremendous brotherhood among cricketers around the world and at this time South Africans extend their sympathy to all those affected by this terrible event. We are hurting after our defeat by Australia yesterday (Monday), but this puts into perspective what real suffering is. Our thoughts are with the Sri Lankan players and we hope they arrive home safely to their families.         
	Late on Tuesday, families of some of the Sri Lankan cricketers also reacted.         
	Here goes:         
	Vasana, Chaminda Vaas wife: I thought it was a joke because somebody was saying that why will anybody want to hurt a cricketer. Then he phoned and said a few were hurt and had been taken to the hospital. He called again and said they have been airlifted and taken by helicopter to the air force base and were waiting for the flight to come home as soon as possible.         
	Thilan Samaraweeras wife: I panicked. I was informed about the incident. A lot of people spoke to me. Thilan also spoke to me and I became less worried. I hope everyone recovers.         
	Tharanga Paranavitanas father: I am very saddened by this incident because this happened during a sporting event. As a father I am really sad about this incident. I hope to see my son soon.         
	Ranjani, Ajantha Mendis mother: My son called me in the morning and said there was an attack on them. He said there were minor injuries and there was nothing to worry about. I prayed to God to protect my son.

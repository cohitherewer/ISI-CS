                                                     Night steals day but doesnt claim Murray 
    - Big w turns a new page as Centre Court tennis hits the roof             Kevin Garside            A security guard keeps a close watch as the roof is closed over the Centre Court on Monday. (Reuters)                                 
	London: One way or another the day was about roofs, one sliding across Centre Court, another caving in. Well, Andy Murray was up against a Swiss with a gunslingers backhand and for a set at least for the Scot was fondue. In other words a mess.         
	We should have known it was coming, the moment when a Wimbledon monster leaps out of the margins to usher in our worst nightmare. It had all been going too well, serene passage into the second week, barely the hint of a trauma on the Murray carousel.         
	Who was this Stanislas Wawrinka anyway? Roger Federers hitting partner, thats who, a fiend in his friends clothing.         
	Twenty-five minutes elapsed before Murray put a number on the board. At 4-1 it was hardly time to get the bunting out. A deafening silence enveloped Centre Court. The first set was signed off to Wawrinka.         
	Murray was holed up in the locker room until 6.31pm (local time), 10 minutes after Amelie Mauresmo buried a return into the net to close what turned out to be the match that spawned that phone a friend moment; you have 30 seconds, your time starts now: Who was on court when 3,000 tones of steel was deployed for the first time?         
	It was Wimbledons Apollo moment, the sections of the roof inching towards the central docking point. The coupling brought a round of applause at command headquarters. Houston we have contact. The context was bit thin, a little light spotting drifting across the Lawns of Tranquillity. That was all the excuse the organisers needed. The covers were on and the roof fired up.         
	That was it. Moisture over. But the roof stayed on. According to members, the All England Club was protecting Murray from a 70 per cent threat of rain. Of course they were. It was nothing to do with seeing the match to a conclusion, to the darkest finish in the tournaments long history. Besides there was a shower out there. Sadly in those early exchanges it was Murray.         
	Where was the big hitter of last week? The first week of a Grand Slam is a common entrance for the seven days that matter. Murray was a stellar pupil. There was barely a question he couldnt answer. The ones he didnt know he guessed.         
	He cannot have been expecting this. It must be something to do with the mountain air. The confidence, the composure, the ease with which Wawrinka tossed Murray aside was Federeresque.         
	This was Wawrinkas day in the filtered sun.         
	The second set was achingly tense.         
	 On 4-3 at break point Murray was almost climbing the stands to hack into the Swiss serve. Then boom, a Wawrinka backhand missed the target at last. Murray torched the turf with a guttural scream: Come on! Murray levelled the scores with an ace, reassuring Centre Court with an authoritative shake of the fist as he walked by to the chair all square.         
	This was how champions respond. The traumatised puppy of the first set had discovered the joys of teeth.         
	Wawrinka tried to keep it tight in the early part of third set when the momentum had started to shift.         
	Murray broke a string deep into the fourth set and with it lost his serve. Wawrinka served out to take us into a fifth. Night had already stolen the day. Would it claim Murray, too? At 10.37pm (local time) we had our answer, Murray on his knees giving thanks. He is coming back Wednesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lewis practice far from perfect, Sutil surprises
                                                   Lewis practice far from perfect, Sutil surprises
                      
	Melbourne: Williams Nico Rosberg dominated Formula Ones first day of practice at the Australian Grand Prix on Friday while McLarens world champion Lewis Hamilton languished near the bottom of the timesheets.         
	Force Indias Adrian Sutil was a surprising ninth in both sessions, but Giancarlo Fisichella did not have it as good  from 14th in the first free practice, he improved but marginally in the second to finish at 13th.         
	Force India have the same Mercedes engine as McLaren.         
	Rosberg lapped quickest in both sessions at a sunny Albert Park while Hamilton was 18th of the 20 drivers in the second.         
	Only Renaults Brazilian Nelson Piquet and 20-year-old Swiss rookie Sebastien Buemi in a Toro Rosso were slower than the Briton.         
	On the first appearance of the new-look, slick-tyred Formula One cars at a Grand Prix weekend, last years pecking order appeared to have been turned on its head by the radical new regulations.         
	The three teams using controversial rear diffusers  Brawn GP, Toyota and Williams  showed why their rivals are so concerned after they filled six of the top seven places in a second session held late in the afternoon.         
	The trio had been subjected to protests Thursday by other teams, who argued their cars were illegal, before stewards cleared them for Sundays season opener pending appeal.         
	Rosberg, who finished third in Melbourne last year but otherwise struggled for points, led Japanese teammate Kazuki Nakajima in a Williams one-two in the first practice.         
	His best time of one minute, 26.053 in the second session was 0.104 quicker than Brazilian Rubens Barrichello in the Brawn and well inside the 2008 pole of 1:26.714 set by Hamilton.         
	Its been a positive day, weve gone better than I expected, Rosberg, son of Finlands 1982 champion Keke, told reporters.         
	My hopes are higher than they were before that we can definitely score consistent points.         
	Definitely weve done a nice step forwards ... I think we are going to be able to enjoy ourselves for the first few races.         
	Hamilton, who has already warned it would be tough to score a point this weekend in an uncompetitive car struggling for pace, showed that McLarens problems were very real.         
	Obviously were not as a quick as wed love to be but were working quite hard and we got through quite a good programme, said the 24-year-old. We dont really know what everyone else is doing on the track but were happy with what weve done today.         
	Jenson Button  scorer of just three points in his last 18 races  was sixth and fifth respectively for Brawn.         
	Rivals still saw his team, who emerged from the remains of departed Honda, as the ones to watch.         
	I think probably the Brawn was running quite a lot of fuel today so we havent seen everybodys true hand and probably wont do until tomorrow (Saturday) afternoon, said Red Bull team boss Christian Horner.         
	Red Bulls Australian Mark Webber ended the day with the fourth fastest time.         
	Champions Ferrari had a largely anonymous day. Kimi Raikkonen, the 2007 champion, was 11th in the final session while Brazilian teammate and 2008 runner-up Felipe Massa was 10th.         
	None of the three Formula One champions in action finished in the top 10.         
	The regulations have changed dramatically this year, with cars running on slick tyres and with new-look aerodynamics.         
	Some teams are also using the new Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) that gives drivers an extra boost at the push of a button.         
	Sundays race is also starting later than usual to cater to European television audiences, with a twilight finish.           (REUTERS)

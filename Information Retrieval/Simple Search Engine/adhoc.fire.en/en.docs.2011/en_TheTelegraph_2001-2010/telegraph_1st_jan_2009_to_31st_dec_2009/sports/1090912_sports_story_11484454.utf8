The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Superb Nehra bowls India into the final
                                                   Superb Nehra bowls India into the final
                      
	Colombo: A disciplined Team India spanked New Zealand by six wickets in a low-scoring match here at the Premadasa Stadium on Friday night and qualify for Mondays final against Sri Lanka.         
	With this win, India became the No.1 ODI side in the world.         
	In a dull match bereft of significant batting pyrotechnics, India chased down the modest 156-run victory target with aplomb and nearly 10 overs to spare.         
	For them, Sachin Tendulkar (46), Suresh Raina (45 ..) and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (35 ..) came up with useful knocks as they cruised to 156 for four in 40.3 overs, sending the Black Caps out of the tournament after their second successive defeat.         
	Electing to bat first in the must-win game, New Zealand were bundled out for 155 in 46.3 overs with Man-of-the-Match Ashish Nehra (3/24) and Yuvraj Singh (3/31) mowing down the top and middle order.         
	Skipper Daniel Vettori top-scored with 25, while Jacob Oram contributed 24.         
	This win makes their match against Sri Lanka on Saturday inconsequential.         
	The target, for the Indians, was not intimidating but the conditions did not ideal for the stroke-makers and runs were not easy to come by.         
	In the absence of regular opener Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir, India sent Dinesh Karthik to open the innings with Sachin, the scheme, however, did not click.         
	Kyle Mills trapped Karthik (4) in the third over even though the ball seemed missing the leg stump. Sachin and comeback man Rahul Dravid added valuable 60 runs before the former captain fell to Jacob Oram after a 45-ball 14.         
	Sachin batted with ease before he chipped a Daniel Vettori delivery to Martin Guptil at cover field and fell four-run shy of a well-deserved half-century.         
	Yuvraj Singh (8) opened his account with a boundary but miscued a slog-sweep and fell to a Vettori delivery, leaving India at 84 for four.         
	Dhoni and Raina played sensible cricket, shunning risk, to see India home with an unbeaten 72-run stand. In a match conspicuous by the paucity of big shots, Raina, besides, his three fours hit two sixes, in his 54-ball knock.         
	Earlier, Yuvraj and Nehra scalped three wickets apiece while R.P. Singh and Ishant Sharma chipped in with two wickets each. Nehra, who is back in international cricket after four years in the wilderness bagged his 100th wickets on the day.         
	The Black Caps, while batting, failed to recover from the early jolts on a tricky Premadasa track. As many as five New Zealand batsmen got into the 20s but none of them could make it really big and bail the team out. They started on a disastrous note as Nehra trapped Jesse Ryder in the third delivery of the innings.         
	The Black Caps met with another quick jolt when Brendon McCullum (3) fell to Nehra before R.P. Singh dismissed Ross Taylor. Martin Guptill (22) and Grant Elliot (22) tried to steady the innings and put on 32 runs for the fourth wicket before Yuvraj removed both to deal a deadly blow.           (PTI)

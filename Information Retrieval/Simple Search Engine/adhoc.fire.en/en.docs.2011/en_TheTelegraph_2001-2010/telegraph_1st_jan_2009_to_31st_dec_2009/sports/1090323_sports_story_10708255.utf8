The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murray gets past Federer 
                                                   Murray gets past Federer 
                      
	Indian Wells: Britains Andy Murray took advantage of an error-prone Roger Federer to reach the final of the ATP event at Indian Wells with a commanding 6-3, 4-6, 6-1 victory on Saturday.         
	The 21-year-old Scot fended off a spirited fightback by the Swiss in the second set to wrap up the win and will meet world No. 1 Rafael Nadal in the final on Sunday. Nadal, champion here in 2007, beat American favourite and seventh seed Andy Roddick 6-4, 7-6 in the second semi-final at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden, clinching the tie-break 7-4.         
	Murray, who has won ATP titles this season in Rotterdam and Doha, where he beat Federer in the last four, broke the Swiss twice to sweep through the first set in half an hour.         
	Although Federer raised his performance to level the match, Murray regained control by breaking in the fourth and sixth games of the third to seal victory in one hour 48 minutes.         
	Every time I play Roger, I feel like I got a shot to win, Murray said after beating Federer for the sixth time in eight encounters. Thats one of my best wins against him for sure. Im playing the match how I want it to go. If I started trading big groundstrokes with someone like Federer, I think he likes that. I havent done it against him, and I dont do it against many people, added Murray, who became the first Briton to reach the final here since Tim Henman in 2004.         
	Federer, the No. 2 seed who won the Indian Wells title for three consecutive years from 2004, piled up 32 unforced errors to Murrays 15.

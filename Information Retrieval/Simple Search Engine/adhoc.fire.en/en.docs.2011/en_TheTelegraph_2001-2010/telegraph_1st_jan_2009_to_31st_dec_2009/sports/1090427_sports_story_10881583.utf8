The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachins team not taking Knight Riders lightly
                                                     Sachins team not taking Knight Riders lightly
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin Tendulkar                           
	Port Elizabeth: Eight years ago, Sachin Tendulkar got dragged into a ball-tampering controversy, courtesy Match Referee Mike Denness, here.  
	---------------------  
	Late on Sunday, it began raining in Port Elizabeth too. Clearly, rain and the Kolkata Knight Riders cant stay without each other.  
	-------------------  
	On Sunday, his latest visit to somewhat sleepy but scenic Port Elizabeth, this time as the Mumbai Indians captain, Sachin looked relaxed.         
	His mood, perhaps, had something to do with the family  Anjali, Sara and Arjun  being around.         
	In fact, minutes after checking-in at the Garden Court (which is hosting the IPL teams), Sachin accompanied the family to a nearby restaurant.         
	Wife Anjali and the kids joined Sachin in Durban, in time to celebrate his 36th birthday, on Friday, and will be in South Africa till the weekend.         
	Its nice that the family is here... Team commitments apart, Id just like to be with them, Sachin said, in a brief one-on-one with The Telegraph.         
	The Mumbai Indians next match is against the Kolkata Knight Riders, on Monday. Both have three points on the table, but Sachins team has played a match less.         
	All teams are good... Its about how you play in those 20/40 overs... We definitely arent taking any team lightly, Sachin maintained.         
	The Knights got in around half-an-hour before the Mumbai Indians, after a 70-minute flight (on a cramped CRJ-200 aircraft) from Cape Town, and almost straightaway had a recovery session.         
	One change is assured as Sanjay Bangar, who played the last match, has been sent home. Its quite likely that his place will go to Arindam Ghosh.         
	Murali Kartik, incidentally, tweaked his neck in the gym. The left-arm spinner was in considerable pain and had to wear a neck brace. Hed been dropped in the last match.         
	Were looking ahead with confidence... Im saying so because weve prepared well... The results, so far, dont reflect the effort weve put in and what were capable of delivering, pointed out John Buchanan, the Knights head of cricket operations.         
	Monday is a national (Freedom Day) holiday and, so, a full house is expected at St Georges Park.         
	Match starts: 8 pm (IST).

  - Opener hits 109 as Sri Lanka end Day I on 366/8       K. KUMARASWAMY                            
	Mumbai: After the bland fare in Ahmedabad and, to a significant extent, in Kanpur, India and Sri Lanka were served a royal meal at the Cricket Club of India. And both sides feasted.         
	The Brabourne pitch lived up to expectations on the opening day of the final Test as the visitors closed at 366 for eight after electing to bat.         
	The hosts might have given away a few more runs but the bowlers, particularly spinners, would have considered the bounce and turn as a welcome respite.         
	A bit more discipline from the seamers and spirited fielding could have helped India check the Lankans more effectively. They also appeared a bowler short after conceding 153 runs in the final session.         
	Tillekaratne Dilshans 109, his 11th Test century and the second of the series, and a steady, unbeaten 86 by Angelo Mathews proved crucial as the duo steered the team to safety.         
	Dilshan has been enjoying a purple patch that has seen him amass 1,081 runs, including six centuries, in the longest format this year.         
	 The elevation to the openers slot is the recognition of the destructive abilities of a batsman who has scored hundreds against New Zealand, Pakistan and India.         
	It was an atypical knock by Dilshan and contrasts with the one in Ahmedabad.         
	For someone known for his aggression and improvisation, Dilshan was unusually watchful in the first half-an-hour. Tharanga Paranavitana enjoying the majority of the strike in the first 10 overs probably contributed to that impression.         
	But even after opening his shoulders to Sreesanth  when he hooked and pulled the pacer off consecutive balls for a six and a four  Dilshan didnt lower his guard. He continued to keep his head down instead of taking the aerial route, especially against the spinners. His footwork was decisive against Harbhajan Singh and Pragyan Ojha.         
	He was unlucky to become the victim of a dubious decision by Englands Nigel Llong, who adjudged him caught bat-pad while the replays showed there had been no contact between leather and the willow.         
	Mathews struck form at the most inopportune time for the Indians.         
	Having failed to live up to the expectations in the first two Tests, Mathews curbed his natural instinct and put together vital partnerships with Dilshan and Prasanna Jayawardene (43), for the fifth and sixth wickets, respectively.         
	For India, Harbhajan proved to be the star of the day with four for 107.         
	But things werent that good for the seamers and Zaheer Khan (1/70) and Sreesanth (1/66) appeared to struggle to control the significant movement they got both in the air and off the pitch.         
	Paranavitana (53) played a crisp knock to help Lanka take advantage of the duos poor application.         
	After Zaheer and Sreesanth allowed Lanka to get off to a flying start  the 50 came up in less than 10 overs in the morning  they also failed to make an impact with the second new ball.         
	Sreesanth, immaculate in line and length on his return in Kanpur, was off-colour except in his second spell of five overs that yielded a wicket against seven runs.         
	Whether the Lankans have done enough in the first innings would be clear once Virender Sehwag leads Indias reply on Thursday.

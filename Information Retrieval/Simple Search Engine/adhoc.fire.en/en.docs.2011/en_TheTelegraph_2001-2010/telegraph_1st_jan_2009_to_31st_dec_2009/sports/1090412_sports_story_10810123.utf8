The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - All eyes are on Alight
                                                                                                               All eyes are on Alight
            PRAVESH GUPTA                            
	Mumbai: Expectations are very high from the 15 runners in the line-up for Sundays mega event, the 2,400m McDowell Signature Indian Derby. At least six horses in the star-studded field are champions in their own right but the filly named Set Alight, with her stupendous performance, has continuously been raising the bar. Therefore, this Derby has the credence for comparison with some of the best top-class events in the world.          
	Set Alight has not had her measure since making her debut, each time winning her races the way she liked. The southern challenger, Icebreaker, boasts of finishing the closest behind - by two and-half-a-lengths - Set Alight in the 1000 Guineas, but the formers subsequent poor performance in the Ladies Derby, the Indian Oaks, was a damper for her followers.           
	However, trainer S. Padmanabhan is not unduly perturbed. Icebreaker was never intended to be given a hard run before the Derby, which was exactly a fortnight away, said a source close to the trainer. Earlier, Icebreaker had beaten another champion filly, Abs Fabs, in the Bangalore edition of the Oaks and the Derby.          
	Abs Fabs smashing victory in the Calcutta Derby has, however, rekindled a new hope among her backers. The filly has improved by leaps and bounds since the Bangalore season, said her trainer Arjun Mangalorkar.          
	Riyasat is the other filly who is in the reckoning since beating Nora and Icebreaker in the Oaks. The Cooji Katrak-trained ward has otherwise been a kind of also ran classic contender before winning the Oaks. Her vast improvement cannot be passed off lightly, said Katrak.          
	The Derby is not all about fillies, their male counterparts are no pushovers. Autonomy, for instance, is a great fighter. The 2000 Guineas winner had been winning his races with a measured effort. Although, the Bezan Chenoy-trained horse is yet to traverse the Derby distance, his preparations over the longer course have been impressive.          
	Equally impressive are Dancing Dynamite and Juventus in their Derby workouts. The two horses ran desperately close to Autonomy in the 2000 Guineas. The equation in the Derby may change with little luck.          
	All things considered, Set Alight (Malesh Narredu-up) is the one to beat with Icebreaker, Autonomy, Dancing Dynamite and Juventus, a full-brother to the last years Derby winner, Hotstepper, being there to battle it out for the minor placings.

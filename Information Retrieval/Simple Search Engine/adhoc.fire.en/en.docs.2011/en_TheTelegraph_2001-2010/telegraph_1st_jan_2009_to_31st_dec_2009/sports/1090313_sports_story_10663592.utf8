The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ex-leggie appointed chairman
                                                   Ex-leggie appointed chairman
                      
	Colombo: Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksas cricket advisor and former leg-spinner, D. Somachandra de Silva, was Thursday appointed the new chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC).         
	That he will be appointed as the chairman was reported by The Telegraph last Saturday.         
	The appointment came nearly three months after former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga was sacked from the post following differences with sports minister Gamini Lokuge. Duleep Mendis will continue to work as chief the executive of SLC.         
	De Silva represented Sri Lanka as an all-rounder and was also the captain of the national side during 1982-83. Nishantha Ranatunga, brother of Arjuna, was appointed as the secretary of SLC, a statement said.         
	Nishantha was a former presidential media advisor in 2003-05.         
	While Sujeewa Rajapakse was appointed treasurer, Lalith Wickramasinghe, Pramodaya Wickramasinghe, Ranil Abeynaike and A. Gunaratne Weerasinghe were made members of the interim committee.

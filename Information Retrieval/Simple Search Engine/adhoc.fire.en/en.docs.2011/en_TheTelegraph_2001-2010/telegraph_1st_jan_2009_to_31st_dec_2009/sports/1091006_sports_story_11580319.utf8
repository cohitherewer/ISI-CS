  - I-League Brazilian striker Joshimar scores a brace; Surkumar sees red       A STAFF REPORTER            Action during Mohun Bagans match against Chirag United at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh                                 
	Calcutta: Rivals beware! Chirag United have arrived big time. They are no longer those party-poopers who are happy to be a footnote at the end of a season. Instead this I-League they will be the team to watch out for. Atleast at home, the likes of Eduardo Chacon, Edmilson, Joshimar and Shylo Malsawmtluanga will give the Dempos, Churchill Brothers and Mahindra Uniteds a run for their money.         
	On Monday at the Salt Lake Stadium in an I-League match Subrata Bhattacharyas boys made a statement loud and clear when they rallied to down a 10-man Mohun Bagan 3-2. It was not the start Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa would have wanted.         
	For the record Chirag have already made East Bengal bite the dust in the IFA Shield in September.         
	Down by a 15th-minute goal by Marcos Pereira, Chirag never lost heart and made the most of that one-man advantange  Surkumar Singh was rightly given marching orders three minutes before half-time for unnecessarily lashing out at Gauranga Biswas  to leave the pitch with three vital points.         
	Things also went awry for Bencharifa when his star striker Jose Ramirez Barreto had to be pulled out in the 24th minute.         
	Chirag restored parity in the 32nd minute when Edmilson, playing his first match for the winners, converted a penalty after goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee brought him down inside the box.         
	After the change of ends, Chirag, obviously buoyed by Surkumars red card, tightened the noose around the Bagan neck. Edmilson and Joshimar  along with Gauranga Biswas and Malswamtulunga  tormented Bagans defence time and again.         
	And their persistent effort paid off in the 66th minute when Joshimar headed in a Malsawmtluanga delivery from the right.         
	The stuttering Bagan defence wilted again three minutes later and and the lanky Brazilian got his second and his teams third.         
	Man-of-Match Denson Devadass corner from left found an unmarked Joshimar at the far end and the latter tapped it home much to the delight of the Chirag camp. Interestingly, till the other day Chirag were mulling to get rid of this striker!         
	Bagan, however, managed to pull one back in the 75th minute. Rakesh Masih slotted home a Marcos Pereira corner past a hapless Chirag custodian Sandeep Nandy.         
	As minutes went by, desperate Bagan players parked themselves at the Chirag half and did create some chances. But they were undone either by some dogged defending or their strikers profligacy.

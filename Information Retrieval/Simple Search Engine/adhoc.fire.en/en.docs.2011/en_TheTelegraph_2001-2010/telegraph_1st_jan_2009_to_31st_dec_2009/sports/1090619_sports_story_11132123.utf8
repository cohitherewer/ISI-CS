	 Allegations against T20 manager
    Hyderabad: The Andhra Cricket Association (ACA) Thursday excluded its general secretary V. Chamundeshwaranath, who was the Team India manager for the Twenty20 World Cup, from discharging his duties following allegations of corruption in purchase of chairs and favouritism in team selection. The ACA has sent a communication to the BCCI over its decision to exclude Chamundeshwaranath.               
	 Tour off
    Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has refused to send their national under-19 team to Bangladesh expressing concerns over security. The PCB has conveyed to its Bangladesh counterparts that it will not be sending the under-19 team for a scheduled tour in October due to security reasons, a PCB spokesman said today. The Bangladesh board had in March declined to host the Pakistan senior team saying it could not guarantee safety of the touring squad after a mutiny.               
	 Parnell view
    Calcutta: Teenage South Africa pace bowling sensation Wayne Parnell has told the ICC Cricket World audio show he is out to make his own mark on the game rather than follow in the footsteps of past players. I really want to be the first Wayne Parnell rather than the next someone else, Parnell said.

                                                   Message from Jacks wife was inspiring: Watson
                      
	Turnberry: A text message from Jack Nicklauss wife helped inspire 59-year-old Tom Watson to grab a shock lead early in the British Open first round on Thursday.         
	There is something slightly spiritual about today, the veteran American told reporters after a five-under-par 65 put him one shot ahead of the field. I received a text yesterday from Barbara Nicklaus.         
	She wished me good luck and I texted her back and said: We really miss you over here, and I really meant it. Its not the same without Jack playing in the tournament.         
	The eight-time major champion and his good friend Nicklaus were involved in the famous 1977 Duel in the Sun at Turnberry, a thrilling head-to-head won by Watson.         
	Asked if his 65 could propel him to another British Open title at the same venue 32 years later, Watson replied: The quick answer is yes... I feel Im playing well enough to win.         
	Given more time to reflect, he said: How am I going to do the next three rounds? I dont know, dont have a clue.         
	I wish I could tell you Im going to break the Open record and shoot 262 but well just see.         
	Watson turned back the clock to the time when he claimed five British Open victories by notching five birdies in a flawless round, the highlight a 20-foot putt that disappeared into the cup at the par-four third.         
	Nicklaus, now 69, said a few years ago he no longer wanted to simply make up the numbers in the major championships.         
	I concur with Jack, said Watson.         
	I dont want to be a ceremonial golfer. When R amp;A chief executive Peter Dawson told me about the 60-year age limit for this tournament I said: Peter, thats a sensible decision.         
	I think theres a certain age limit, youve got to let the younger kids play.         
	For now, though, Watson says he still has what it takes to lift the coveted Claret Jug.         
	I feel as if I can compete against the kids, he said. Being a ceremonial golfer is when you feel like you cant compete.         
	Im a ceremonial golfer at the US Masters, I can tell you that, (but) I can still beat this golf course somehow.         
	It would be amazing (to win). You can put all kinds of superlative adjectives to it but I dont think about it, its one of those things that will happen if it happens.

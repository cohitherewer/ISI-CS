                                                                                                                       7                                        Bhaichung to rejoin camp today
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bhaichung Bhutia                           
	New Delhi: India captain Bhaichung Bhutia will rejoin the national camp in Goa on Friday but is unlikely to resume training immediately.         
	The East Bengal striker, who was released from the camp last week after an MRI scan revealed strain in his calf muscle, was advised rest by the doctors including the specialist he consulted in Mumbai.         
	I am going back to Goa tomorrow, said Bhutia on Thursday. But I am yet not sure whether I would start training immediately. It all depends on what the doctors tell me to do.         
	Two other injured players  Mahesh Gawli and Samir Naik  are yet to join the camp despite repeated reminders from the All India Football Federation (AIFF). The two players, Dempo informed, would only join after they were declared fully fit by the doctors.         
	On Sunday, the AIFF president Praful Patel will be in Calcutta to hold a series of meetings, including the one with the two Calcutta majors, Mohun Bagan and East Bengal to discuss the problems the clubs are facing in the I-League and in general.         
	Patel will also meet the office bearers of the IFA and preside over the emergency committee meeting of the federation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Viru, Gautam need to be fresh: Sachin
                                                     Viru, Gautam need to be fresh: Sachin
                  Sachin                     
	New Delhi: India has the wherewithal to defend the Twenty20 World Cup in England but openers Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir will have to overcome the fatigue factor if the team is to achieve the goal, reckons Sachin Tendulkar.         
	Sachin was impressed with the Indian youngsters performance in the ongoing IPL but the Mumbai Indians captain also pointed out that both Sehwag and Gambhir have not been consistent enough.         
	I think, individually the boys are doing well. Look at Rohit Sharma, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, MS (Dhoni). In the bowling department Zaheer (Khan) was doing well before he got injured and RP Singh has come up leaps and bounds. Only our opening combination of Gambhir and Sehwag hasnt fired, Sachin said.         
	I think the key would be how soon they can shed off the fatigue factor. They have been playing back to back for a long time now and it would difficult to keep up the tempo, Sachin told a website.         
	Incidentally, India coach Gary Kirsten had earlier expressed similar concern.         
	Sachin, however, was of the view that the IPL has been an ideal preparation for the Twenty20 World Cup.         
	...It is. You are playing the same format and you are playing against the best bowlers and also not in home conditions. So, I think this is a good preparation except that the players should take adequate rest between the IPL and the ICC World Twenty20, he said.         
	Sachin also reiterated his stance that even though he enjoys playing Twenty20, he never thought about representing India in this slam-bang format lest the team composition is disturbed.         
	I never thought that I would play the World Twenty20. MS Dhoni and his Twenty20 team have done wonderfully well and I just hope they continue to do so. I have no plans to play T20 for India, Sachin said.         
	About his teams debacle in the ongoing IPL, he said: We blew hot and cold. There were times when we could have done better than we did. I think it is a batsmans format and in our case it was the batsmen who let us down.         
	Asked for his reaction on Harbhajan Singhs comment that the spinner didnt know what his role was in the team, Sachin said: I wont like to comment on that, it is his personal opinion. (PTI)

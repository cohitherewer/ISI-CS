The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni had predicted Sehwag controversy
                                                   Dhoni had predicted Sehwag controversy
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Nottingham: It may sound bizarre, but Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni predicted that some in the media would twist his comments on deputy Virender Sehwag out of context.         
	According to a well-placed source in the team, Dhoni actually went up to Sehwag (after last Wednesdays warm-up match against Pakistan) and said kal koi zaroor controversy bana de ga.         
	It wasnt the next morning, but two days later that a newspaper back home claimed Dhoni and Sehwag were at loggerheads and that tension between the two would hurt the teams prospects in the World T20.         
	Dhoni couldnt have been specific about Sehwags injury (at the post-match media conference) for two reasons  admitting that hed come with a problem could have compromised Indias position if a replacement was needed and, then, its best to keep the opposition guessing...         
	Why help the opposition in its planning? Dhoni knew that some would give his comments a spin... Thats exactly what happened, the well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	Dhoni may have predicted accurately, but the unity-parade and related actions, here last Friday, ought to have been avoided.

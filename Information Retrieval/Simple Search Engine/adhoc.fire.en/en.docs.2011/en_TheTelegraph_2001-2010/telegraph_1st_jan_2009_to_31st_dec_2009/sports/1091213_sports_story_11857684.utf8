	Chandigarh: Sreesanth, who tested positive for swine flu on Friday and was admitted to Fortis Hospital in nearby Mohali, is likely to be discharged Sunday.         
	He is responding well to treatment, and if he continues to recover in this manner, he could be released as early as Sunday. But he will have to take rest for the next four to five days, hospital director A.R. Banerjee said.         
	I met him today (Saturday), he is cheerful. His brother also arrived from Kerala. Sreesanth watched television and looked relaxed, he said.         
	The Indian team heaved a sigh of relief after opener Gautam Gambhir, manager Mayank Parekh and video analyst Dhananjay tested negative for the H1N1 virus.         
	Parekh was hospitalised early Saturday with flu-like symptoms. Gambhir and Dhananjay, too, showed mild symptoms, prompting the team management to get them tested as a precautionary measure.         
	All three tests have turned out to be negative, Punjab Cricket Association (PCA)s joint secretary G.S. Walia said.         
	Sreesanth has already been ruled out of the first two one-dayers in Rajkot and Visakhapatnam. Ishant Sharma is likely to take his place in the side.         
	The Chandigarh health authorities decided to brush aside the normal practice of isolating those who have come in contact with a swine flu patient saying there was no cause for worry.         
	There is no need to isolate them or keep them under observation as they are not carrying symptoms of the disease. They are safe. Any flu like symptom does not mean it is H1N1, acting nodal officer for swine flu U.C. Bansal said.         
	The Indian team, however, has been advised to report to the health authorities immediately if anyone is found with symptoms of swine flu. We have even advised the Sri Lankan team members to take preventive measures, a Punjab health official said.         
	Most of the players of both sides have been administered antibiotics as a preventive measure. No player, however, was treated with Tamiflu.         
	We cannot administer the drug to anyone who does not test positive for the virus, Bansal said.         
	The PCA president Inderjit Singh Bindra also said there was no need to panic. The team morale is high and there is no panic. The PCA is in constant touch with the team physio and doctors. Barring Sreesanth and three others, who were suspected, nobody else so far has shown signs of even the ordinary flu, Bindra said at a news conference.

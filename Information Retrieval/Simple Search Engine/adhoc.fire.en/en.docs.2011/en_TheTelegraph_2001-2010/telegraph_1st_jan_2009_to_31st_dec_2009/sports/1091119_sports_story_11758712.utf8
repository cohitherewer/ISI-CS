The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tough draw for Federer
                                                                                                                                     Tough draw for Federer

	London: World No.1 Roger Federer will face his US Open conqueror Juan Martin del Potro in the round-robin stage of the ATP Tour finals after getting the rough end of Wednesdays draw for the season finale.         
	The Swiss, who is not guaranteed to end the year on top of the rankings, will also face Britains Andy Murray and Spains Fernando Verdasco in Group A at the eye-catching O2 Centre alongside the Thames when play starts on Sunday.         
	Rafael Nadal, who missed last years finals in Shanghai, appears to have the easier draw as he tries to topple Federer from the top spot.         
	The Spaniard, who beat Federer in the Australian Open final, will play Serbias world No.3 Novak Djokovic, Russian Nikolay Davydenko and Swede Robin Soderling, who ended Nadals reign at the French Open this year.         
	Soderling, beaten in the French Open final by Federer, replaced American Andy Roddick who withdrew from the event on Tuesday with a knee injury.         
	Argentinas Del Potro stunned Federer at Flushing Meadow in September, preventing the Swiss winning the title for a sixth consecutive year, and their meeting will be an intriguing contest, as will Nadals re-match with Soderling.

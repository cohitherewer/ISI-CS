                                                     Tuffey, Bond in Trophy squad

	Christchurch: Former Indian Cricket League (ICL) players Shane Bond and Daryl Tuffey were Sunday named in New Zealands squad for next months Champions Trophy in South Africa.         
	Bond has also been selected for the tri-series against India and Sri Lanka scheduled from September 1 to 8. Brendon Diamanti joins the previously-named squads for the Twenty20 International series against Sri Lanka and the tri-series.         
	For the ICC Champions Trophy, one change has been made to the ODI squad with Tuffey coming in to replace Nathan McCullum, New Zealand Cricket (NZC) said in a statement here.         
	New Zealand coach Andy Moles said Diamantis addition to the ODI squad in Sri Lanka would provide the side with an additional all-rounder.         
	Brendon is a strong lower-order batsman and has good control as a medium pace bowler  he will provide valuable back-up for the squad, said Moles.         
	Diamanti is currently playing in India with the New Zealand A side and will head to Colombo on August 26. Ian Butler, who is in New Zealand after playing recently in the UK, will travel to Sri Lanka on August 24.         
	Tuffey has been part of the team for the Test series in Sri Lanka, but will not play the limited-over matches there as the team has decided to take three spinners in the Twenty20 and ODI series.         
	With turning wickets here in Sri Lanka, were keen to have three spinners on call, said Moles. But conditions will be different in South Africa  two spinners will be sufficient there, and Daryls inclusion will give our seam attack additional depth.         
	Meanwhile, NZC Sunday appointed captain Daniel Vettori and coach Andy Moles in the national selection panel after Dion Nash stepped down from his position due to personal commitments. Vettori and Moles will join Glenn Turner and Mark Greatbatch, while John Wright will act as an adviser to the panel.NZC announced the new selection panel after a review of the selection processes and composition of the panel. Announcing the new panel, NZC chief executive Justin Vaughan said the structure reflected the need for an integrated approach to selection.         
	The make-up of this selection panel  with the inclusion of both the coach and captain  is innovative but consistent with the way we have been operating. Both captain and coach currently form our on-tour selection panel, who select teams when the Black Caps are playing, Vaughan said in a statement.

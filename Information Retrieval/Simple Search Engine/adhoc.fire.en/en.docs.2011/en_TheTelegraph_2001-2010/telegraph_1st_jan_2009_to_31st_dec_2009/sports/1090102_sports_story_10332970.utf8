	Coaches do not have to be liked by their players but they need to be respected by them otherwise their authority diminishes to the point where their job becomes untenable.         
	The crisis meeting, called by Pietersen and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chairman Giles Clarke, suggests that the captains relationship with Moores is at breaking point.         
	But while ECB insiders insist it is just a clear the air meeting it would not be unlike Pietersen, who is not shy of flexing his muscles, to issue a me or him ultimatum to his bosses.         
	Pietersen clearly had misgivings about Moores from the start, seeking assurances from him about his methods before he accepted the captaincy following Vaughans resignation last August. The 5-0 drubbing by India in the one-day series and the subsequent loss of the Test series there have not improved the relationship, which is thought to have been further strained by Vaughan, a player Pietersen clearly wanted back in the squad, not being selected for the West Indies.         
	As one with scant experience of leadership, Pietersen needs a coach he can rely on to tie up the minor detail that can overwhelm skippers unused to filtering out the mental junk that goes with the job. But defeat in Chennai, where England lost a Test to India they should have won in their sleep, suggested that the tactics and decision-making processes between captain and coach were malfunctioning so badly that Pietersen became desperate to get the experienced Vaughan back on board  a move he believes Moores, in his role as one of four selectors, helped to block.         
	The timing of the talks, just six months before the Ashes, is significant. After defeats by India and South Africa, Australia are more vulnerable than at any time in the last 20 years and Pietersen does not want his team hampered by a coach he clearly feels is out of his depth in international waters.         
	Instead of mere efficiency from the coach he wants inspiration and someone who can analyse opponents and plot their downfall, attributes Moores is thought to lack.         
	The most drastic solution, which is to sack Moores, would be expensive. Apart from the lack of obvious replacements being available at such short notice, the upheaval and cost caused by bringing in the new man and his backroom staff, so close to big tournaments like the Ashes and World Twenty20, would be at least 1 million. Player power may be on the rise, but there are surely limits to how much it is indulged.         
	Which leads us to what a modern coachs role should entail? An efficient organiser and enthusiast, Mooress creed is hard work, though that can only get you so far in the dirty business of winning cricket matches.         
	In that regard, and with Test series wins over only the West Indies and New Zealand, he is still something of a lightweight when compared to his predecessor Duncan Fletcher.         
	But how accountable should the coach be made for results? As Keith Fletcher once said in his capacity as England coach: I cant go out to bat or bowl for players.         
	He was right, but a coach should motivate and improve those he works with, something that Moores does not appear to have achieved, with the likes of Monty Panesar, Alastair Cook and Ian Bell appearing to have gone backwards under his tutelage.         
	Indeed, in India, only Andrew Strauss showed signs of having advanced his game and you could put that down to him spending three months away from the England bubble.         
	If India was difficult, the ill-fated Stanford week in Antigua seems to be when captain and coach first reached rock bottom. A game that no one quite knew how to pitch in order to win both the match and the moral high ground ended with England humiliated on all fronts. But while Pietersen must shoulder some of the blame for not getting his players minds right, the bulk of it must lie with Moores, who some observers claim was detached to the point of withdrawal.         
	If Moores is ousted, the putsch will be one almost unique to cricket. Had the same personality clash happened in football the coach would simply have changed the captain or dropped him.         
	In cricket, the captain remains the big cheese, which is why the top brass at the England and Wales Cricket Board will find it difficult not to back Pietersen when crunch time comes in the New Year.

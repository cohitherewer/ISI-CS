The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand clinches series vs Karpov
                                                                                                                                     Anand clinches series vs Karpov
                  Viswanathan Anand                     
	Ajaccio: World champion Viswanathan Anand tamed former World champion Anatoly Karpov of Russia in successive two encounters to win the rapid four-game chess series 3.5-0.5 here.         
	The Indian, who was leading the series 1.5-0.5 after winning the first game and drawing the second with the Russian at Bastia, beat Karpov in both the remaining games to ensure a spectacular victory.         
	It was a Queens gambit declined by Karpov in the first game and Anand got an opening advantage after Karpov did not place his queen properly.         
	Karpovs position became passive and he was saddled with the task of just defending with little counterplay to the end of the match that lasted 30 moves.         
	His Queen on c5 was in trouble as I had ways to threaten it. After (gaining the advantage) white is better and pressing, he slowly ran out of time trying to defend, Anand said after the first game.         
	In the last game Anand was in no mood to relent either.         
	Playing the black of a Nimzo Indian defence, Anand faced the Capablanca variation and gained early lead in development.         
	As the game progressed, Karpov missed the thread of the position completely amid complexities and had to pay heavy dividends as Anands forces simply cruised into his territory.         
	Karpov resigned after 32 moves.         
	I tried to play aggressively as black was ahead in development. It is just too complicated to give an exact opinion, Anand said after his series victory.         
	Anand will now move to Moscow to take part in the Tal Memorial chess tournament, commencing from November 5, which is arguably the toughest event of the year.         
	The field of the championship includes Vladimir Kramnik of Russia, Magnus Carlsen of Norway and Levon Aronian of Armenia, among others.         
	This is Anands first appearance in competitive chess since losing the Mainz Classic title in August.                 (PTI)

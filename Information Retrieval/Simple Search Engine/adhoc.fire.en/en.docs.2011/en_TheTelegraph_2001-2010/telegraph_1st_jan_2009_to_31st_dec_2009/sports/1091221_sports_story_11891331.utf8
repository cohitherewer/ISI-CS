	Centurion: England survived a batting collapse to draw the first Test against South Africa at Centurion on Sunday.         
	South Africa claimed five wickets in the last 15 overs to leave the visitors, who had been set 364 for victory, teetering on the brink of defeat on 218 for nine.         
	However, Paul Collingwood (26) and last man Graham Onions (1) endured the last 3.1 overs to secure a thrilling draw for England, who finished on 228 for nine.         
	South Africa were favourites to win when they reduced England to 27 for three inside the first hour on the final day.         
	But the South African-born duo of Kevin Pietersen (81) and Jonathan Trott (69) seemed to have guided England to safety with their steely fourth-wicket partnership of 145.         
	Pietersen, who was aggressive throughout, collecting 11 fours and produced some breathtaking drives off the front foot, survived an lbw when the umpire called the delivery from Friedel de Wet a no-ball.         
	But he was run out in the second over after Tea, opening up an end through which De Wet, assisted by the second new ball, burst through in an inspired spell of three for 11 in seven overs.         
	Left-arm spinner Paul Harris and paceman Morne Morkel chipped in with a wicket apiece as the match concluded in an electrifying atmosphere.         
	Pietersen and Trott steered England to 169 for three at tea. Pietersen was run out after nudging the ball into the off-side and setting off while Trott stayed out at the non-strikers end.         
	Trott and Collingwood carried England through to 201 for four when South Africa took the second new ball and the lower order cracked under the pressure.

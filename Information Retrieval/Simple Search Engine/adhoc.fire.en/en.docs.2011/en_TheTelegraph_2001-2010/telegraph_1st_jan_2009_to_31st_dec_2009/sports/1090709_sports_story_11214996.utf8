                                                   F1 in grip of fresh trouble 
                            
	London: Formula Ones fragile peace deal was stretched to breaking point on Wednesday after Ferrari and seven other teams walked out of a meeting in Germany with the governing body over next years rules.         
	The eight Fota (Formula One Teams Association) teams were invited to attend the meeting to discuss their further proposals for 2010, the International Automobile Federation (FIA) said in a statement.         
	Unfortunately, no discussion was possible because Fota walked out of the meeting.         
	Fota, who had threatened to set up their own breakaway series until what seemed to be a breakthrough deal was announced in Paris last month, said in a statement that Formula Ones future was again in jeopardy.         
	Fotas members are championship leaders Brawn GP, BMW-Sauber, Ferrari, McLaren, Red Bull, Renault, Toro Rosso and Toyota.         
	The technical working group session, at the Nuerburgring before Sundays German Grand Prix, had been due to bring together Fota, the three new entrants for 2010 plus Williams and Force India who are suspended from Fota.         
	The FIA said the aim had been to agree changes to the 2010 regulations, in line with the decision taken last month to revert to the version of the sporting and technical rules in place until April 29 this year.         
	That agreement looked fragile within days when FIA president Max Mosley accused Montezemolo of likening him to a dictator and the Fota teams of dancing prematurely on his grave.         
	Mosley had said he would not seek re-election when his term of office ends in October, with his departure seen as a key part of the deal, but the Briton has subsequently hinted he is inclined to stand again.         
	Mosley wrote to the non-Fota teams on Tuesday reminding them that the published 2010 regulations could only be changed with the unanimous agreement of all confirmed entrants.         
	In a separate letter to Montezemolo, he said that the five non-Fota teams were the only ones fully confirmed for next season at present.         
	Fota said they had been told during the course of Wednesdays meeting by FIA technical head Charlie Whiting that contrary to previous agreements they had no voting rights because they were not yet fully entered for next season.         
	A request for the meeting to be postponed was rejected and they had no option but to walk out because they could not exercise their rights.         
	Fota said that at no point in the Paris discussions was any requirement for unanimous agreement on regulations change expressed.         
	To subsequently go against the will of the WMSC (FIA world motor sport council) and the detail of the Paris agreement puts the future of Formula One in jeopardy.         
	Wednesdays FIA statement said that all changes have now been agreed subject only to the maintenance of the minimum (car) weight at 620kg and the signing of a legally binding agreement between all the teams competing in 2010 to reduce costs to the level of the early 1990s within two years, as promised by the Fota representative in Paris on 24 June.

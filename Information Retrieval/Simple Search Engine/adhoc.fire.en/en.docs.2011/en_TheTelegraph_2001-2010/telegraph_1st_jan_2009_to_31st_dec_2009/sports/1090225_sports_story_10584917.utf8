                                                   Joy, relief as Tiger is ready to tee off
                      
	Marana (Arizona): The PGA Tour celebrates the return of Tiger Woods to competition this week after an eight-month injury absence with a mixture of huge relief and joy.         
	The world No. 1, sidelined since his extraordinary US Open play-off victory at Torrey Pines in June, is back to defend his title at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship.         
	More importantly for the Tour, though, is the likely impact of the most influential player in the game. Ever since he turned professional in late 1996, Woods has been golfs equivalent of the goose that continues to lay golden eggs.         
	In many ways, he has almost single-handedly ushered in an era of multi-million dollar endorsements and lucrative appearance money over the last decade and more.         
	His Afro-American-Asian background has spread the sport to an audience far beyond its traditional image of male, white and middle-class and he has become arguably the worlds best known and most marketable athlete.         
	The absence of Woods over the last eight months was a little like trying to stage the Oscars without the prized statuettes.         
	Television ratings have plunged at tournaments where he normally plays. On top of that, the world has changed since Woods defied stabbing knee pain and a double stress fracture of his left tibia to beat fellow American Rocco Mediate over 19 holes to clinch his 14th major title.         
	The global economic landscape has been left in tatters and the PGA Tour faces an uncertain future.         
	Eleven of the Tours title sponsors come from the financial sector and many of these contracts are up for renewal after the end of the 2010 season.         
	His return has been viewed as golfs ideal stimulus package but the world No. 1 prefers not to see it like that.         
	The only thing I can control is my play, the 33-year-old said after announcing his comeback. We as a collective whole on the PGA Tour have to do a better job of making sure that we appreciate all the fans and sponsors for what they do for us and allowing us to have an opportunity to compete and play for a living.         
	In these times, I think everyones well aware of how important that is. Over the years we may have taken that for granted but now is a time when reality has checked in.         
	Virtually to a man, Woodss peers have celebrated his return.         
	We need him back and were all excited to have him back, American world No. 3 Phil Mickelson said.         
	I hope he stays healthy because its evident the game needs him. The economy has been struggling, the sponsors have been struggling and to have him back is so critical for the sport.         
	Woods will take on Australian Brendan Jones in the first round on Wednesday.         
	Jeev Milkha Singh, meanwhile, has been pitted against English Ryder Cup star Ian Poulter in the first round. Of the 32 pairs in fray, Jeev and Poulter begin last at The Ritz Carlton Golf Club, Dove Mountain. The winner of the Jeev-Poulter battle would meet either Sergio Garcia or Charl Schwartzel in the next round.

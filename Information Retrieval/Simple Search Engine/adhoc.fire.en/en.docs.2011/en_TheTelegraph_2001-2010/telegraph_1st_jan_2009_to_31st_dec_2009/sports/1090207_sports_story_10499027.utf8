	Chennai: After posting a formidable total, West Zone were in a commanding position against South Zone at close on the second day of the Duleep Trophy final here Friday.         
	In reply to West Zones formidable first innings total of 459, South were tottering at 106 for four in 38 overs at stumps, with skipper S. Badrinath batting on an aggressive 54.         
	Giving him company was Dinesh Karthik on five.         
	At one stage South were cruising at 71 for one, but left-arm spinner Rajesh Pawar and off-spinner Ramesh Powar struck in tandem to put West in a position of strength.         
	South got off to a sedate start as M. Vijay, despite being dropped by Jaffer in the slips in the very first over, and India discard Robin Uthappa took time to settle down.         
	But the early introduction of spin on a wicket that offers some turn, did the trick as Rajesh Pawar induced an edge from Vijay immediately after tea.         
	A few overs later, Uthappa too fell when he yorked himself against the off-spin of Ramesh Powar. Uthappa scored 32 in 63 balls with five fours as South were reduced to 71 for two.         
	Badrinath, who came in at number three, did most of the scoring as he lost the more experienced Rahul Dravid for five runs in 31 balls and M. Suresh (zero) in a space of 2.4 overs.         
	Dravid stepped out and attempted to drive Rajesh Pawar, but the leading edge was taken by Jadhav at gully, pushing South further back on 93 for three.         
	Suresh too followed suit after he was run out following a mix-up.         
	Earlier, resuming at 303 for five, the West Zone lower order frustrated the South Zone bowlers to ensure that the total touched the 450-run mark. West Zone were finally all out for 459 in 141.4 overs, about 45 minutes from tea.         
	Overnight centurion Ajinkya Rahane, stretched his score to 165 and in the process added 60 runs for the sixth wicket in 21.3 overs. Trivedi (23) fell leg before to left-arm spinner Jakati.         
	Rahane added a further 37 runs in 7.3 overs for the seventh wicket with Kedhar Jadhav before falling at 165, after hitting 17 fours and three sixers in his 303-ball essay.         
	Kedhar Jadhav scored 47 while Rajesh Pawar (18) and Ramesh Powar (12) too contributed their mite to swell the total past the 450-mark.         
	For South Zone, medium pacer S. Sreesanth and off-spinner R. Ashwin claimed three wickets each, while left-arm spinner Jakati claimed two wickets.           (UNI)

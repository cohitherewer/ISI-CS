                                                   MFC look for a point
                      
	Margao: Desperate for a win after two losses, Mumbai Football Club (MFC) have a battle at hand when they take on defending champions Churchill Brothers at the Nehru Stadium, here, in the third round of the I-League.         
	MFC look depleted after they lost some key players during the transfer season. They were handed defeats in their opening matches against Dempo and Chirag United but their coach Khalid Jamil is unfazed by the setbacks.         
	Its early days and our boys are learning from their mistakes. We had plenty of chances to score against Chirag United but our boys failed to take advantage which led to our defeat, stated Jamil.         
	Churchill are a formidable side and are the team to beat. We need to play to our potential to overcome them. Our aim is to collect a point and would be satisfied if we do that since it is an away match, stated Jamil.         
	Churchill will be missing their prolific goal poacher Odafe Okalie as he was red carded in the last match against Viva Kerala. But the good news is that their keeper Arindam Bhattacharya is back in action.         
	Odafes absence will be a big relief as he is a dangerous players who can score goals at will, Jamil said. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Md. Sp. scrape past Vasco
                                                     Md. Sp. scrape past Vasco
                  Suraj Mondal scored the lone goal                     
	Margao: Mohammedan Sporting survived anxious moments in the second half to edge out Vasco by a solitary goal in the 19th round encounter of the ONGC I-League at Nehru Stadium, here on Saturday and thus kept their hopes of saving relegation alive.         
	Suraj Mondal scored the all-important goal in the 18th minute when he headed home a well directed cross from Mike Okoro off a move from the right by Roque Barreto.         
	The win takes Mohammedan Sporting to the 10th position with 19 points from 19 matches, a point ahead of JCT. After todays defeat, Vascos relegation seems confirmed as they remained at the bottom of the table with 10 points from as many matches. The teams failed to impress even though Vasco dominated the match. But inept shooting by their strikers, particularly Sherzod Nazarov, who muffed two easy chances from close, cost them the match.         
	Mohammedan Sporting keeper Naseem Akhtar, who displayed good reflexes under the bar, made at least three blocks to save the day for the visitors and was adjudged the man of the match.         
	Vasco had the first real chance to score but Sherzod Nazarov and Joy Ferrao failed to connect to a cross from the right by Ravshan Teshabaev in the 16th minute.         
	Mohammedan Sporting slowly settled down and came up with a couple of good moves from the right that exposed Vascos defence, which in the absence of the experienced Covan Lawerence, nearly conceded another. But keeper Laxmikant Kattimani blocked Surajs effort off Sheikh Azims pass.         
	Vasco had the best chance to equalise five minutes before the interval when a pass from Donald Rocha inside the box saw Menino Fernandes directing the ball over the bar from close.         
	The change of ends saw Vasco completely dominating the match as they probed the rival goal more often and repeatedly tore apart the defence (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Flintoff says he is fit for Ashes
                                                   Flintoff says he is fit for Ashes
                      
	London: England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff declared himself fit for this summers Ashes series against Australia.         
	Flintoff, who captained England in 2007 when Australia strolled to a 5-0 whitewash, wants to use this weeks three-day friendly against Warwickshire at Edgbaston to prove his right knee is free of injury.         
	He believes he is on target to be at his peak for the first Ashes Test at Cardiff, which begins on July 8.         
	For the past eight weeks since the knee operation, Ive been working hard  hopefully that is all behind me now, Flintoff said Monday.         
	Ill just keep maintaining my fitness and looking after my knee as well as my ankle. Ive played three weeks for Lancashire, bowled my overs, managed to score a few runs, and Im pleased where I am at this stage.         
	This game with Warwickshire is the final piece of the preparation for the team and also for myself. Ive played two championship games and three Twenty20s and so this last game is very important, for form and also to bowl some overs and to get some more runs.         
	Flintoff is keen for an extended spell of action after injuring his knee while playing in the Indian Premier League in April.           (AP)

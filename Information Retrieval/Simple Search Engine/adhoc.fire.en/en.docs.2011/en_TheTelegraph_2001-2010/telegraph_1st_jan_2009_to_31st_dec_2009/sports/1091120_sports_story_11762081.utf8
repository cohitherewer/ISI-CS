The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Semenya will keep her medal
                                                                                                                       7                                      Semenya will keep her medal
                      
	Johannesburg: South African runner Caster Semenya will keep her 800m gold medal from the world championships, and the results of her gender tests will be kept confidential, the South African sports ministry said Thursday.         
	The ministry also said in a statement that the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has agreed to allow the 18-year-old Semenya to keep her prize money.         
	Whatever scientific tests were conducted legally within the IAAF regulations will be treated as a confidential matter between patient and doctor, the sports ministry said.         
	On Wednesday, the IAAF said the gender tests performed on Semenya had not yet been completed. It had been expected to announce the findings Friday.         
	Before the 800m final in Berlin, the IAAF said it had ordered gender tests because of Semenyas muscular build and rapid improvement in times.         
	The case set off a storm in South Africa, and the IAAF was accused of violating her privacy. South African track officials were accused of failing to protect her.

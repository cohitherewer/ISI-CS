                                                   Karim: Bagan no pushovers
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Circumstances seem to have changed Mohun Bagans priorities. The Calcutta giants prospects of pipping Churchill Brothers to the I-League title is growing bleaker by the day and so they would obviously want to concentrate on the AFC Cup where they are certainly not out of the race yet.         
	Karim Bencharifa, Mohun Bagans coach, though had a different opinion to offer at the news conference on the eve of their match against Al Kuwait SC on Tuesday. I was misunderstood earlier. We were in such a situation I couldnt go all-out in the previous matches. Fatigue, after a long season, was a definite reason. But now, the situation is different. We are physically in better shape. We have regrouped and are refreshed after our last I-League match, which we won, he clarified. He added: We still have five days before our next I-League match against Dempo and that means we can go full throttle against Al Kuwait.         
	According to Karim, Bagan who have lost both their AFC Cup matches so far, deserved at least a point each from both of them. Karim was quick to remind that his team were also in with a chance. Dont write us off. A win can change things. Perfection doesnt exist in football and so mistakes may happen anytime. But we have to be smart to outclass them, said Karim.

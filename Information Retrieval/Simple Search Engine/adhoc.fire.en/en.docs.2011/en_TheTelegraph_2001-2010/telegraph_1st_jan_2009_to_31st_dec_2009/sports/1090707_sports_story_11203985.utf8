	Gros Islet: Yuvraj Singh is the backbone of Indias batting line-up, said skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, lauding his deputys contribution in the 2-1 series triumph over the West Indies.He is the backbone of our batting line up. Coming in at number four, he always takes up the responsibility and sets up the platform for the batsmen down the order to contribute, Dhoni said after the fourth and final match was abandoned due to rain.         
	When he sets himself up, rest assured that he is in for a big score, Dhoni, who was adjudged the Man of the Series, said.         
	Dhoni said a series triumph on foreign soil is always special and showered praise on his bowlers for adapting to the conditions.         
	Its a pleasure to win a series out of the country. The bowlers have taken the initiative, we have a very good bowling attack. The youngsters who came in and got a chance have proved themselves. I think we really have a very good side, he said.         
	Dhoni said he was most pleased to see Ishant Sharma return to form after a lean spell. Handed the responsibility of opening the attack in the washed-out fourth and final ODI against the West Indies here, Ishant was bang on target from the word go and sent packing rival captain Chris Gayle for duck with the second ball of the innings.         
	Ishant gave away just 17 runs in his four overs, which earned him the praise from his captain. (PTI)

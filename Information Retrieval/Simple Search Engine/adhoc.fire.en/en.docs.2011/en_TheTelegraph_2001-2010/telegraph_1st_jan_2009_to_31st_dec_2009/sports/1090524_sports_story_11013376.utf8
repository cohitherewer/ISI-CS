The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal primed for high fives 
                                                   Nadal primed for high fives 
                                        
	London: Rafael Nadal had expected to race to a record fifth successive French Open title before Roger Federer cast a shadow over the Spaniards Roland Garros prospects.         
	After 34 days of the 57-date European claycourt season, it had seemed as if only one name would be engraved on the Musketeers Cup this year since no one could beat the Paris champion on red dust.         
	That was until Sunday last, when world number two Federer finally found a way to break the indomitable spirit of the Spaniard in the Madrid Open final.         
	Apart from earning his first title of the season, the victory would also have gone some way towards healing Federers dented pride since he had been on the receiving end of a 6-1, 6-3, 6-0 mauling by Nadal in the Paris final 12 months ago.         
	Add in two soul-destroying five-set final loses to Nadal at last years Wimbledon and the 2009 Australian Open, it is little wonder that Federer was left a tearful wreck in Melbourne.         
	Nadals incredible run has resulted in many people, including Andre Agassi, tipping him to complete a rare calendar Grand Slam this year but Federer intends to play spoilsport.         
	I think when a guy wins the Australian Open and his better surface is clay then sure there is a big chance that he might go two for two, said the 27-year-old Swiss, who has been left holding the runners up tray in Paris for the last three years.         
	But I came very close a few times and its not the easiest thing to do. There are guys who dont want to allow him to do that and I am the first guy (in that queue).         
	Federer is seeking a 14th Grand Slam title to equal the overall record of Pete Sampras.         
	Beating the world No.1 at higher altitude in Madrid, where the clay plays faster, is likely to count for nothing when the seasons second major begins on Sunday.         
	The Spaniard has flattened everyone who has stood before him to win the French Open four times in four attempts and the chances of anyone snapping that run appear extremely slim.         
	He is now primed to become the first player  man or woman  to win five successive French titles since the tournament went international in 1925.         
	Federer might have snapped Nadals 33-match winning streak on clay but it was world number four Novak Djokovic who laid all the groundwork.         
	The Serb, who turns 22 on Friday, must be the unluckiest player around as he could have won all three claycourt Masters titles this year had he not stumbled into Nadal.         
	After rattling Nadal in the Monte Carlo and Rome finals, he did everything right except convert one of the three matchpoints he had against the Spaniard in their Madrid semi-final.         
	Andy Murray has already enjoyed a fruitful year by becoming the first Briton to climb into the top three in the ATP rankings but his chances of reaching the second week remain modest as he has yet to find his feet on clay.         
	Meanwhile, a relaxed Dinara Safina has the perfect opportunity to prove that she is a legitimate world number one.         
	Dubbed Marata for her propensity to lose her nerve when things do not go her way, Safina, who has just won back-to-back titles on clay, has yet to win a Grand Slam and some of her rivals believe she does not deserve to sit on the throne.         
	Safina now wants to focus on herself with the help of her coach, Zljko Krajan, and fitness coach Dejan Vojnovic.         
	From Stuttgart to Rome then from Rome to Madrid, the conditions were different. In Paris, it will be different again, she said.         
	But to me, it does not change anything. I must keep the same concentration model.         
	This years French Open could prove the best opportunity for the 23-year-old Russian since her rivals have failed to shine on the red dirt.         
	Defending champion Ivanovic is back in action after a knee injury which forced her to withdraw from Madrid last week, and has dropped to eighth in the WTA rankings after losing form since last years Roland Garros.         
	Serena Williams, who considers herself the true world No. 1, retired injured from her first-round match in Madrid, saying she just wanted to preserve her chances for Roland Garros.         
	While Safina is bringing a 13-1 clay-court record to Paris, Serena, who has not made it past the last eight at the French Open since reaching the semi-finals in 2003, has not won a single match on the slow surface this year.         
	The threat to Safina, apart from her nerves, could come from in-form Svetlana Kuznetsova, who beat her in the Stuttgart final although the world number seven was no match for her fellow Russian in the Rome final.

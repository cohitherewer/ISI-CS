The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chargers have upper hand vs Super Kings
                                                     Chargers have upper hand vs Super Kings
                  Adam Gilchrist                     
	Durban: The Chennai Super Kings will start as underdogs against rampaging table-toppers the Deccan Chargers in an Indian Premier League (IPL) match here on Monday. The Super Kings have been struggling with poor form and the pull-out by star all-rounder Andrew Flintoff, costliest player on the IPL roster along with Kevin Pietersen, has only added to their woes.         
	The Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led Chennai side have won just one of their four matches so far, losing two while splitting points in their fourth game against the Kolkata Knight Riders following a wash-out.         
	The Chargers, on the other hand, have been simply unstoppable winning all three of their matches, riding mostly on their good batting led by in-form captain Adam Gilchrist.         
	In contrast, the Chennai side have been surprisingly off-colour and the only win they have managed so far came against the bottom-placed Royal Challengers Bangalore.         
	Opener Matthew Haydens good form and the fact that he is available for the entire tournament seems to be the lone highlight of Chennais campaign so far.         
	The burly Australian, who retired from international cricket last year, is the leading scorer of the tournament having accumulated 166 runs in three matches, including two fifties, at a strike rate of over 171.         
	But the rest of their batting has not been able to back Haydens form much as yet, quite evident in their loss to Delhi DareDevils.         
	Set 189 to win, Haydens 57 and Suresh Rainas 41 were the only notable contributions for the Super Kings in their nine-run loss.         
	Dhoni, considered one of the best international captains right now, has somehow failed to inspire the team and his lacklustre form with the bat has also become a concern.         
	On the other hand, last seasons laggards the Deccan Chargers have completely turned it around under Gilchrist this year and much of it has been possible because of their excellent batting.         
	Gilchrist himself have been in superb touch and is fourth on the leading scorers list with 119 runs at a strike rate of 150.         
	South African Herschelle Gibbs and West Indian Dwayne Smith have ensured that Gilchrists blazing run is complimented well at the top.         
	Add to this, pacer R P Singh and spinner Pragyan Ojhas good form with the ball and it is well understood why the Chargers are the firm favourites against the Super Kings. (PTI)

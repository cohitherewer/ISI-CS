The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cilic halts Nadal run
                                                   Cilic halts Nadal run
                      
	Beijing: A crestfallen Rafa Nadal was still searching for his first final since injury interrupted his season after a 1-6, 3-6 semi-final defeat to Marin Cilic at the China Open on Saturday but Novak Djokovics 6-3, 6-3 victory over Robin Soderling moves him ahead of Andy Murray in the ATP rankings list.         
	Murrays withdrawal from next weeks Shanghai Masters because of a wrist injury means Djokovic was able to reclaim the No. 3 spot from the Scot and, should he win the final in China he will move further clear of the British No 1.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB rails at FTP snub
                                                   CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	PCB rails at FTP snub   
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has accused big nations India and Australia of trying to marginalise the strife-torn country in the draft of the Future Tours Programmes from 2012 to 2020.  
	The PCB had raised strong objection to the FTP drafted by the BCCI since it does not include any bilateral series between the archrivals and refused to sign the same unless the Indian board revises the draft. The draft was placed before the ICC for ratification by the executive board last month but we resisted because we were being marginalised in the new FTP, a PCB official said on condition of anonymity.         
	Qadir hearing         
	 Karachi: Surprised by his sudden resignation from the post of chief selector, the standing committee of the National Assembly on Sports has summoned Abdul Qadir for a hearing on July 14. The committee will also discuss the dissolution of the national senior and junior selection committees by the PCB chairman Ejaz Butt and performance of the PCB officials.         
	Nazir apology         
	 Karachi: The PCB chairman Ejaz Butt has forgiven opener Imran Nazir for his misconduct during a domestic Twenty20 championship final, paving the way for his return to the national team for the one-day series in Sri Lanka. Pakistans acting chief cricket selector Wasim Bari has hinted at the return of Nazir to the national fold.         
	Pak selectors         
	 Karachi: The PCB has decided not to appoint paid selectors in future and will have a single selection committee to pick both national senior and junior teams. A senior PCB official said that the hue and cry over the dissolution of the separate selection committees was not justified, as people do not know the real facts.         
	Tanvir to play         
	 Karachi: The PCB has given a green signal to all-rounder Sohail Tanvir to play for his Indian Premier League franchise the Rajasthan Royals in a charity match against Middlesex at Lords on July 6. The sports management company which represents Tanvir said in a statement that Tanvir would represent the Rajasthan Royals in the match being played for the British Asian Trust.         
	Murali for T20         
	 Melbourne: Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan may sign for Australian domestic side Victoria Bushrangers for the Twenty20 Big Bash and play as at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, where he was labelled a chucker 14 years ago. Murali has been in touch with the authorities in Cricket Victoria, he is pretty keen to represent Victoria. If it goes through it will be great news, Muralidharans manager Kushil Gunasekera said.         
	Bedi rueful         
	 New Delhi: Former skipper Bishan Singh Bedi has lamented lack of recognition from his home state board of Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA). I dont think the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) would have ever remembered me for whatever I did, rued the left-arm spinner.

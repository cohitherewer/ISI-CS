            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL            Ramiz Raja                           
	Calcutta: Ramiz Raja, former Pakistan captain and a one-time chief executive officer of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), spoke to The Telegraph from Lahore on Saturday evening.         
	Ramiz, incidentally, was a member of the 1992 World Cup-winning XI under Imran Khan.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q Your thoughts on the cricket-related happenings in Pakistan over the past 10-12 days?         
	A Pakistan cricket, I think, has been pushed into a needless controversy... The team did reasonably well in the Champions Trophy and the allegations of match-fixing were totally uncalled for... The ICC has a strong mechanism in place to take care of that... Why would a team, which only recently won the World T20, even get involved in something as insane? We couldve done without such negative publicity.         
	But the drama of that kind isnt anything unusual for Pakistan cricket...         
	Well, it has to stop... This team has been doing pretty well and the World T20 win, in particular, got the entire nation behind it... Im happy that our media has played such a positive role in this episode and has asked the chairman of the National Assemblys standing committee on sports, Jamshed Dasti, to apologise to the nation... He had no business accusing the team of match-fixing and asking (captain) Younis Khan to account for his leadership... The standing committee has never been positive, never ever been constructive.         
	Even youd been summoned once, isnt it?         
	That was in 2004, after we lost the home series to India... I was so upset that I told the then PCB chairman, Shaharyar Khan, that I wouldnt respond to another summons... The standing committee doesnt have anybody with a cricket background and, if it has to do a thorough job, instead of merely seeking publicity, then it should seek the help of experts. What pains me is that the standing committee never calls the captain and the coach after the team has done well... I dont recall reading any words of appreciation... Dont ever recall hearing any words of praise.         
	Generally, isnt there too much political interference in the PCBs functioning?         
	Not in day to day matters... Not in matters of selection either.         
	Do you support Youniss decision to quit as captain?         
	After his experience with the standing committee, he didnt have a choice... Any self-respecting captain, and one with so much passion, wouldve done the same thing... I have a lot of time for Younis... Hes honest, believes in transparency and says whatever he wants to... He does have a few weaknesses, like everybody, but is improving as a captain... Some find him emotional and temperamental, but I dont see that as a problem.         
	Reports have suggested that Younis actually wants a fixed tenure...         
	Im not aware.         
	What would be your advice to Younis?         
	That he should unconditionally make himself available to captain in Tests... If Younis so wishes, he could review his future in the 50-over game... Where Tests are concerned, he remains our star batsman.         
	You must have been surprised by Youniss candid admission, after the Champions Trophy semi-final against New Zealand, that the broken (little right) finger made him put down a match-turning catch...         
	I was, yes... But that spoke volumes for the character of Younis... Players like their captain to be honest and he has been just that.         
	Assuming Younis doesnt take back his resignation, who should be the next captain?         
	Shahid Afridi in all forms of limited overs cricket... Hes already the T20 captain and has been conducting himself brilliantly.         
	The Afridi of 2009 is a changed person and cricketer...         
	Absolutely... In his early years, hed been unsettled... Getting to lead Karachi in domestic cricket clearly helped change his game... Hes a vastly improved bowler and, as a batsman, has learnt the art of survival... Hes quite unlike Younis, though... Younis is the intense sort and a disciplinarian... Afridi is somewhat of a maverick. However, like fellow-Pathan Younis, hes honest... All Pathans are.         
	Afridi hasnt played Test cricket for over three years now. So, who would be your Test captain?         
	Good question... I dont have the answer!         
	What went wrong in the Champions Trophy?         
	In the semi-final, we didnt have enough runs on the board (only 233 on a good wicket)... Weve got a great attack, certainly the best pair of spinners (Afridi, Saeed Ajmal), but lack a good opening pair and the middle-order is very predictable... We lack a Yuvraj Singh, who can shock the opposition... Take the match away. Of course, weve got Umar Akmal, who is fantastic, but need more of his type.         
	A great World T20, then a disappointing tour of Sri Lanka, a great start in the Champions Trophy before losing in the semi-final... Why is Pakistan so inconsistent?         
	One reason, perhaps, is that we dont always identify the right talent... We dont always pick the right players and, to defend their choice, we then persist with them... Thats wrong... Younis, for example, feels that we need players wholl serve Pakistan for five-six years, not one series, and I endorse that fully.         
	Fielding remains a worry...         
	It will always be and weve got to live with it.         
	Misbah-ul Haq has lost his way. Why?         
	He hasnt really changed his game to suit the demands of limited overs cricket... Then, hes 35 and, to my mind, has reached his potential as a batsman. Misbah, therefore, cant give you more. Hes not an Umar (Akmal), who is such an outstanding situational player... At this age, he cant become one either.         
	Have you been following Indian cricket of late?         
	Yes...         
	Your thoughts on the upcoming series against Australia?         
	Should be a great contest... Australia did win the Champions Trophy, but they arent feared as they used to be... As for India, always difficult to beat at home... The key to doing well would be to not take too much pressure... Somebody like Ishant Sharmas cricket is suffering because, among other things, hes under a lot of pressure... Hes so naturally gifted, all he needs is to focus on the basics and just be himself, instead of worrying about the expectations... (After a pause) If I had anything to do with Indian cricket, Id probably be worried about Harbhajan Singhs form... Hes the lead spinner, after all.         
	Had you been a selector in India, would you have recalled senior pro Rahul Dravid after almost two years and, then, dropped him after a handful of ODIs only?         
	Today, given the talent at hand, I dont think Dravid works for India in limited overs cricket... Hes not one to take the bowling by the collar, hasnt ever been a six-hitter... Dravids been a great technician, has had a great career, but must himself be feeling a little behind now... In fact, Id myself begun to feel that way once Saeed Anwar blossomed... I didnt want to get exposed after a satisfying career and decided that I should leave (in 1997-98)... Im sure India has batsmen whore more devastating and can be more lethal than Dravid... Its not that he didnt give his best, on returning to ODIs, but the game demands more... Thats the way I look at the Dravid issue.         
	The final one: As a Pakistani citizen, how are you coping with the daily terror strikes?         
	(Somewhat emotionally) Its extremely difficult to digest what has been going on, but the entire nation is now on the same wavelength as the government and the army... Everybody wants this rogues-triggered madness to end... It has to stop... Indeed, Pakistan can most certainly do without the publicity generated by the terror strikes... Earlier, the world would say that we were fighting Americas war, now, its our own ... A war which has to be won, as theres no choice.

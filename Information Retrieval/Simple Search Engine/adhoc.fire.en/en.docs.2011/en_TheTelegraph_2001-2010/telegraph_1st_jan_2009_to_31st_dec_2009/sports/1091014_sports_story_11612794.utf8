                                                   Subrata satisfied with result
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Subrata Bhattacharya seemed satisfied with a draw against Air India on Tuesday. It was a match Chirag United should have won had their forwards not squandered the several opportunities that came their way.         
	It was a draw, so I wont complain. Maybe, if it was a loss, I would have complained said Bhattacharya.         
	He didnt wish to blame the refereeing though he claimed that Edmilson should have got a penalty.         
	Bhattacharya was not reading much into the fact that the team failed to hold onto the lead despite a brilliant start. In Indian football, it is difficult to maintain the tempo throughout the match. We could have scored many more! I had to change players to try and go for a win.         
	We are making some errors in the defence. The side backs are still a weakness There is a lack of understanding between the goalkeeper and defenders. Well have to look into it, he explained.         
	Bhattacharya, however, denied any complacency in their ranks.         
	But isnt Sandip Nandy failing to do justice to his reputation? We cannot put Nandy on the bench just because of a few bad matches. Please dont put pressure on him. He is experienced and will surely make a comeback.         
	Air India coach Bimal Ghosh blamed Eduardo Chacons antics with the referee to a attitude problem. The Chirag United coach , however, chose to downplay it.         
	The defender was booked by the referee and could have earned a second one for getting involved in an exchange of words with the referee. Eduardo is a bit hot-tempered and gets too involved in the match He loses his temper very frequently. However, hes playing well, said Bhattacharya.         
	A good referee would have sent Eduardo off, said Ghosh.         
	The Air India coach felt he should have brought in Harpreet Singh earlier. We made a mistake. I should have introduced Harpreet earlier, said Ghosh.

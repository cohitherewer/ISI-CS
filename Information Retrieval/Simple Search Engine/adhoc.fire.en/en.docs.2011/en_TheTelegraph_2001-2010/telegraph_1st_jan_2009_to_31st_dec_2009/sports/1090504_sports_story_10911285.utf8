The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | My batting has been pathetic: Dhoni
                                                   My batting has been pathetic: Dhoni
                      
	Johannesburg: Mahendra Singh Dhonis flop-show in the Indian Premier League (IPL) has left him frustrated and the Chennai Super Kings captain has no qualms about admitting that his batting has been pathetic in the tournament.         
	I think my batting has been pathetic in the tournament so far, Dhoni said.         
	The Super Kings are riding high on back-to-back wins but Dhonis reputation as an explosive batsman is at stake. The star player has managed just 107 runs in seven matches at an average of 21.         
	Dhoni said he was desperate for a good knock.         
	All the big-hitters, including Albie Morkel, Jacob Oram and me didnt really click. We need to perform in future as we are a side that relies heavily on its batting.         
	If one of us clicks, with our top-order performing well, we can give good targets to our bowlers to defend. And that is our strategy, Dhoni said.         
	Overall, Dhoni said he was satisfied with his teams performance and lauded new find Shadab Jakati, the left-arm spinner who took four wickets in Saturdays match against the Delhi DareDevils.         
	It is a very open tournament and people are always looking for fresh talent. Jakati was part of our side even last year.         
	We had a decent batting line-up last year, so we used to play an extra batsman to strengthen our batting, Dhoni said.         
	But this season things have changed, the spinners are being able to get good amount of purchase from the wicket as the innings progresses.         
	The batsmen tend to go after the spinners and take their chances and this is one of the reasons why spinners have been so successful in the tournament, Dhoni said.         
	Dhoni said with youngsters doing well, the selectors would have a hard time picking the Indian squad for the Twenty20 world championship.         
	The more difficult it becomes, the better for us. We will go with the best 15 players in the ICC World Twenty20. So I am quite happy, he said.         
	Dwelling on his team, Dhoni said its a balanced squad and hence the task of picking the playing XI was not a difficult one.         
	More often you will see these four overseas players in our playing XI  Matthew Hayden, Muttiah Muralidharan, Jacob Oram and Albie Morkel.         
	They are an integral part of the team. Until and unless someone gets injured or loses form, we are not going to change them.         
	So, it is not really difficult to pick the playing XI, he said.         
	Chennai Super Kings have seven points from as many matches.           (PTI)

	Verbier (Switzerland): Race favourite Alberto Contador took the Tour de France leaders yellow jersey when he surged less than six kilometres from the finish line to win the 15th stage on Sunday. Teammate Lance Armstrong climbed to second overall.         
	The 15th stage, as had been expected, shook up the top of the standings by ending Rinaldo Nocentinis eight-day run as race leader and giving unmistakable signs that Contador is the rider to be reckoned with.         
	The 26-year-old Spaniard broke away from other pre-race favourites with 5.6 kilometres left in the 207.5-kilometre ride from Pontarlier, France to the Swiss ski resort of Verbier  and he kept extending his lead through to the finish.         
	Contador  the 2007 Tour winner  came into Sundays stage in third place overall, 6 seconds behind Nocentini. Contador finished in 5 hours, 3 minutes, 58 seconds  and the Italian trailed 2:36 back.         
	Andy Schleck of Luxembourg was second, 43 seconds back, and Vincenzo Nibali of Italy was third, 1:03 back.         
	Armstrong, who had entered the day fourth overall and eight seconds behind Nocentini, finished ninth, 1 minute, 35 seconds after the Spaniard.         
	More importantly, the Texan seven-time Tour champion trails Contador by 1:37 in the overall standings. Bradley Wiggins of Britain climbed from sixth place to third, 1:46 behind the Spaniard.         
	Armstrongs rivalry with his Astana teammate Contador, cool during last weeks mostly flat stages, had been poised to re-ignite in the ride to Verbier.         
	Riders get a rest day on Monday before two more stages in the Alps, an individual time trial in Annecy on Thursday, and then a ride up the dreaded Mont Ventoux on Saturday. The Tour ends Sunday in Paris.           (AP)

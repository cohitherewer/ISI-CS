	New Delhi: Five senior West Indies players, including captain Chris Gayle, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Shivnarine Chanderpaul, have threatened to pull out of the forthcoming England series in May and play in the Indian Premier League (IPL) instead, after their discussion with the board over pay dispute failed yet again.         
	The two-day long meeting between the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) and the West Indies Players Association (WIPA) ended Wednesday without reaching any consensus over the pay dispute and in protest the players are now considering standing down from national duty, according to a cricket website.         
	The players, who were represented by WIPA President Dinanath Ramnarine, would require No Objection Certificates from the WICB first before taking part in the April 18-May 24 IPL to be held in South Africa.         
	West Indies tour to England starts from April 21 with the first Test begins at Lords from May 6.         
	Players said they didnt get their full payments for the tour to New Zealand this winter and are awaiting payments for the England series. They also want to know the length of time they can play in the IPL before joining the team in England, according to the website.         
	The players also raised voices against the central contracts which are due to expire at the end of the England tour but new agreements are still not in place.         
	Last Friday, the players refused to take part in three domestic one-day matches, while the national team blanked out Digicel branding on their kit with masking tape during the ODI against England.Ramnarine also resigned from the WICB executive committee last week in protest against the payment related dispute.         
	Meanwhile, all-rounder Andrew Flintoff will return to Englands team in the third ODI against the West Indies in Bridgetown on Friday.         
	Flintoff has recovered from the hip injury he sustained in last months third Test which forced him to fly home.Captain Andrew Strauss said the return of the 31-year-old would leave one player disappointed.         
	After only two games there are no obvious candidates to be dropped but that is a minor problem when you put it into the context of having Fred back in the side, Strauss told the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) website.         
	There are a few options for us to consider and well be considering them before tomorrow.The five-match series is level at 1-1.           (AGENCIES)

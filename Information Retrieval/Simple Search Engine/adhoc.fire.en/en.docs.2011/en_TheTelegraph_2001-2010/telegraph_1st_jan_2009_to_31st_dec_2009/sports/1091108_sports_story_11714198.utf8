    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  KKRs new coach is for a strong relationship with Sourav             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              Dav Whatmore      
	Calcutta: Dav Whatmore, the new coach of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), spoke to The Telegraph on Saturday, the day after the franchise made his appointment official.         
	Whatmore (55), it may be recalled, has coached Sri Lanka and Bangladesh at the international level.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Is this a good or a bad time to take charge at KKR?         
	A (Laughs) Depends on the glass youre looking through... Im comfortable with the timing of my appointment and am hoping to do the best I can to help the franchise improve.         
	Are you on a three-year contract?         
	Yes.         
	Did principal owner Shah Rukh Khan call personally or did the all-important call come from co-owner Jay Mehta?         
	Id rather not get into all that...         
	Fine, but how did you react?         
	Was very excited... Very happy, but I first had to be released by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (from the post of director of operations at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore).         
	Today, what do you see as your biggest challenge?         
	The IPL is something which erupts, like a volcano, once a year and is played over six weeks or so... The time leading up to those six weeks would be important... One will have to think more laterally... Besides working with the domestic players, one will need to integrate those coming from overseas... It will be my duty to create a positive environment, to have harmony within the group. Because one moves from one series to another, coaching a national team is a lot different.         
	What goes into the making of a successful team?         
	Skill, supportiveness within, a shrewd leader... Sound strategy, good training... This list could go on.         
	How would you describe your style of coaching?         
	After so many years, Im still figuring that one out! One works with a range of people and the coachs role keeps evolving... Much depends on the group one is working with, but Im sensitive to the needs of players... I care about them... I didnt play more than seven Tests, but can appreciate the pressures of international cricket and know a thing or two about its requirements.         
	Being a (1996) World Cup-winning coach, youve come on board with quite a reputation. How are you going to handle the reputation-driven pressure?         
	Im no stranger to that... Ive been in pressure situations many times in the past... This challenge is different... Im very much up for it, though.         
	Captain Sourav Gangulys record, so to say, with Australian coaches hasnt been good... Greg Chappell, John Buchanan... Is that at the back of your mind?         
	Look, an easy answer would be that its a thing of the past... I know about it, but Im looking forward to a strong relationship with him... Sourav, I know, feels the same way.         
	But would there be enough space in the KKR dressing room for two rather strong-minded individuals?         
	Strong-minded... Youre saying that...I guarantee that there will be harmony within the group. Unless theres harmony, no team can be successful.         
	Your impressions of Sourav as captain?         
	Hes Indias most successful (in Tests) and figures dont lie... Hes definitely shrewd and has a lot to offer... Souravs got the experience and that, coupled with his desire that the franchise do well, is a potent combination... Indeed, hes central to the scheme of things.         
	When do you intend coming to Calcutta?         
	Pretty soon... Id like to spend some time with Sourav. He wishes to do the same.         
	Most feel that KKR lacks the ammunition...         
	I wouldnt necessarily subscribe to that view... Names dont guarantee success, performances do... Look at somebody like young Manish Pandey, who made headlines in this years IPL (for the Royal Challengers Bangalore)... Ill be focusing on getting the best out of every individual.         
	Are you happy that the Pakistan government and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) wont stop Pakistani players from competing in IPL 2010?         
	Oh, I didnt know about this development.         
	That bit got confirmed when the PCB chairman, Ijaz Butt, spoke to us in Chandigarh, on Monday...         
	Well, who comes in from there is something that will be decided by the franchises management... Sourav will have a big role.         
	From a coachs perspective, just how different is T20 from the more established forms?         
	T20 is still new for us coaches... The principles of preparation and planning dont change too much, its just that everything has to be done very quickly... Youve got to be thinking on your feet all the time.         
	Is T20 only about entertainment?         
	Its certainly very exciting, but there are parts of T20 cricket which can actually help players improve their game.         
	Were you overawed the first time you met Shah Rukh?         
	I was made to feel comfortable... Shah Rukh came across as a wonderful person... Hes genuinely interested in the franchise doing much, much better... Both of us have a vision to take it forward... Im looking forward to working with him.         
	You were in Bangalore for a couple of years. Where will you be based now?         
	Mumbai, as the franchise is keen on centralising its operations as much as possible.         
	Over the years, youve kept a low profile. Now that youre close to Bollywood, how much of a change can we expect?         
	But Ill be coaching cricketers, not film stars!         
	What are wife Kathryns views?         
	(Laughs) Shes quite excited and will come to Mumbai in January.         
	[The Whatmores have two children  daughter Alexandra, who is 25, and son Davenell (Jr), who will soon be 18.]         
	Lastly... Have you either spoken to or intend speaking to predecessor Buchanan?         
	No.

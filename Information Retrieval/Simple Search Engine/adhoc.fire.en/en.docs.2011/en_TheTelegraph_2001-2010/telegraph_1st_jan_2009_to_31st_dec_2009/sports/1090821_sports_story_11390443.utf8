	Qasim is   at it again
    
	Karachi: Ex-Pakistan cricketer Qasim Umar, who is known to make wild allegations, has claimed that former West Indies captain Vivian Richards used to take performance enhancement drugs before anti-doping regulations were enforced by the ICC.  
	Appearing on a television talk show Thursday, Qasim, a controversial figure in Pakistan cricket, said Richards had confessed to him that he used to take drugs to release tension and improve stamina and endurance levels.        
	Karachi: Controversial pacer Mohammed Asif on Thursday cleared the Bleep test, a multi-stage fitness test, to more or less secure his place in Pakistans Champions Trophy squad.        
	London: VVS Laxman continued his prolific run in county cricket, hitting another half-century to guide Lancashire to 226 for seven against Yorkshire in their County Championship match at Headingley Carnegie. Laxmans 121-ball 50 included eight hits to the fence.         
	New Delhi: Shuttlers Chetan Anand and Arvind Bhat advanced to the quarter finals of Macau Open Grand Prix in China with straight-game victories on Thursday. Seventh seed Chetan beat Hans-Kristian Vittinghus of Denmark 21-15, 21-15, while 10th seed Arvind went past another Dane, eight-seeded Jan O Jorgensen, 21-13, 22-20.            
	Vienna: Staff at a World Anti-Doping Agency laboratory in Austria have been questioned by police probing the supply of banned drugs to athletes, officials said Thursday. The interrogations were sparked by Stefan Matschiner, the disgraced former manager of cyclist Bernhard Kohl who was arrested in March for allegedly playing a main role in a nation-wide doping scandal.

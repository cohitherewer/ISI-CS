	Rome: Defending champion Jelena Jankovic had an easy ride to the quarter finals of the Italian Open on Wednesday after her opponent was taken ill, while Ana Ivanovic squandered a four-game lead in the decisive set to lose 6-1, 3-6, 6-4 to Polands Agnieszka Radwanska. World No. 1 Russian Dinara Safina had to battle it out for more than two hours, before she finally downed Zheng Jie of China 5-7, 6-1, 7-6 (7-3).         
	Ivanovic, the French Open champion and fifth seed here, started off poorly and couldnt hold serve in the first set. But the Serb began dictating play with precise groundstrokes in the second, and appeared to be headed towards victory as she jumped to a 4-0 lead in the final set.         
	Radwanska thought otherwise. Playing solid and consistent tennis, the 20-year-old won the last six games, ending the match with one of her 19 winners.         
	I dont know how I did it, shes a great player, the 10th-seeded Radwanska said in a court-side interview. Its always very tough to come back.         
	Ivanovic was more aggressive, and in the end had 31 winners. But she also committed 32 unforced errors  20 more than her opponent.         
	By contrast, Jankovic was in impressive form and was leading 6-1, 1-0 when Kateryna Bondarenko of Ukraine called for the trainer and then pulled out. The two players had been on court for 35 minutes.         
	I would have loved to finish the match, because I was playing pretty well in that first set, Jankovic said. I felt the ball really well and I had good timing.         
	The 24-year-old Serb has won the Italian Open for the past two years and is looking to regain her best form after a slump at the start of the year.         
	Jankovic next plays Russias Svetlana Kuznetsova, who ousted crowd favorite Flavia Pennetta 6-3, 3-6, 6-0 in a little less that two hours.         
	Ivanovics early exit from the tournament has not dented her optimism ahead of her Roland Garros title defence later this month.         
	I feel really good, said Ivanovic, who beat Italian Francesca Schiavone 6-3, 6-4 in the second round on Tuesday, told reporters when asked about her claycourt form before the second Grand Slam, which begins from May 24.         
	Yesterday I played an unbelievable match and that gave me a lot of confidence. My serve is getting much better. I feel power in it. Its back, she said. I just have to stick with the things Ive been doing. Ive been working really hard and obviously I havent played too many matches on clay courts. I feel confident.

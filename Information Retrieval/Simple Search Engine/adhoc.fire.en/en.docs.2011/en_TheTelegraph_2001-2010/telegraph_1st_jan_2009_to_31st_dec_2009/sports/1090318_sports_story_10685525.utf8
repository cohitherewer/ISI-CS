                                                     Field is strong: Randhawa
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Chowrasia                           
	Gurgaon: Ace golfers Jyoti Randhawa and S.S.P. Chowrasia, buoyed by their fine show in the Thailand Open two weeks ago, are hoping to maintain their impressive home record when they start their campaign in the SAIL Open on Thursday.         
	Back in the limelight after his comfortable two-stroke victory in the Singha Thailand Open, Randhawa has sweet memories of the Classic Golf Resort, the venue for the $30,000 Asian Tour meet.         
	In 2000, he secured the first of his three Indian Open titles here. Out of the eight Asian Tour titles Randhawa has bagged so far, five have come on his home turf.         
	I know I have a good record at home, but the field here is still strong, said Randhawa.         
	Chowrasia, too, seems to have finally found the Midas touch that made him an overnight star after his sensational triumph in the Indian Masters in New Delhi in February 2008. Unfortunately, Chowrasia has never been the same in the following 12 months.         
	In Thailand, however, Chowrasia was in good form as he finished fourth, after leading the pack at the end of the penultimate day. The Calcutta-based golfer said he has a good chance of returning to winning ways in the SAIL Open.         
	I am confident of doing well here, Chowrasia said.         
	My game is coming well again and the fourth place finish in Thailand boosted my confidence.         
	I recently got a new putter Tried it in Indonesia and then in Thailand and it feels well. Someone suggested there was some problem with the loft of my previous putter and hence I bought a new one. Im more confident now with my short game, said Chowrasia.

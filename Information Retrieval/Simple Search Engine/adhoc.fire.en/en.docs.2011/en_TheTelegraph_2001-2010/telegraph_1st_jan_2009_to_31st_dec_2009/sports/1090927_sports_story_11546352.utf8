The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods grabs 1-shot lead
                                                   Woods grabs 1-shot lead
                      
	Atlanta: Tiger Woods had to settle for a one-shot lead in the US Tour Championship, which was still not a bad place to be on Friday.         
	Over the final four holes, Woods missed consecutive putts from about 4 feet  one putt for eagle, the other for birdie  and closed with a bogey for a 2-under 68 in sweltering conditions at East Lake to lead Padraig Harrington and Sean Hair.         
	Woods was fuming over the missed putts. He found perspective shortly after signing for his seventh consecutive round in the 60s.         
	Despite the lost opportunities, he was at 5-under 135 and in great position to capture the FedEx Cup and its $10 million bonus.         
	None of the other players among the top five seeds  who can win the FedEx Cup with a victory at East Lake  were among the top 10 on the leaderboard going into the final two rounds.

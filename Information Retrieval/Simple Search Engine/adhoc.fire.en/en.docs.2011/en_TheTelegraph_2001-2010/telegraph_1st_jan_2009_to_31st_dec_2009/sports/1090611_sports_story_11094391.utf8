                                                     By the brace of Gauranga
    - Bengal enter Santosh Trophy final with a 2-0 win over Services           ANSHUMAN ROY            Action during Bengals Santosh Trophy semi-final match against Services in Chennai on Wednesday                                 
	Chennai: Minimum effort maximum effect. Bengal did not do much against Services but got what matters most to book a final berth in the Santosh Trophy, at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here on Wednesday.         
	A brace from Gauranga Biswas (35th and 66th minutes) was enough to show last years finalists the door and give the 29-time champions a chance to bring back the trophy they used to treat like it was their property.         
	For those with a penchant for history, the last time Bengal won was at the same venue some 10 years back.         
	Before Wednesday, in the quarter final league stage, Biswass profligacy had given the Bengal camp some sleepless nights.         
	He found himself in goalscoring positions time and again but could not finish it off.         
	But Wednesday was his day. He made amends for all those muffed chances and how.         
	With P.C. Lalawmpuiya, billed as Bengals saviour in this tournament, huffing and puffing in the inhuman Chennai heat, Biswas took up the cudgels and delivered the goods.         
	If the first goal was about quick thinking  getting into position between two central defenders and the goalkeeper and deflecting Lalawmpuiyas ambitious but harmless volley into the net with a smart header  the second one was all about delivering the knock-out punch on the break.         
	Services earned an indirect free-kick inside the Bengal penalty area but made a mess of it. Off the rebound, substitute Surojit Roy got the better of his marker and laid it off for Biswas who had acres of unmanned space in front of him.         
	Biswas ran and ran with the ball and then zoomed past an onrushing Services goalkeeper, Sujan Seku before slotting it home.         
	The scoreline stayed that way till the end even though Services refused to give up without a fight.         
	With ten minutes remaining, Services had two good chances but one Subhashish Roy Choudhury had other ideas.         
	Twice, the India reserve goalkeeper came to his teams rescue  once diving to his left to fist out a header from Manish Negi and then denying T.L. Kukki a chance to get his name on the scoresheet with an equally acrobatic save.         
	Like Biswas, Roy Choudhury too had a point to make. And his performance under the bar would have silenced those who were for fielding Abhra Mondal on the eve of this semi-final clash.         
	Bengal on Wednesday had a simple plan. Soak in pressure from the fast Services players and catch them off guard on the break.         
	Subho Kumar and Denson Devadas, the Bengal midfielders in the centre of the park, didnt allow Services skipper Shajia DSilva to mastermind the moves by constantly hassling him.         
	So, even though Services had most of the possession, they just could not find a way to break the Bengal defence.         
	Although R. Laldingliana did test Roy Choudhury with a rasping volley midway through the first half, the India reserve goalkeeper was equal to the task and fisted it away for a corner. And S. Raleng, who was such a hit in Srinagar last year, looked like a man bereft of any ideas. But surprisingly he was kept on the field for over 75 minutes by coach Raghuvendra Singh.         
	Barring the brace, not once did Bengal manage to get a look at the rival goal. It had more to do with their reluctance to venture into rival territory than anything else.         
	Maybe last years drubbing at the hands of the same opponents in the semi-final was weighing too much on their minds and they did not want to show too much ambition.         
	After the match, an over-enthusiastic IFA secretary Utpal Ganguli tripped while entering the pitch. Hopefully his Bengal wont stumble at the final frontier. Ten years is quite a long wait. Isnt it?

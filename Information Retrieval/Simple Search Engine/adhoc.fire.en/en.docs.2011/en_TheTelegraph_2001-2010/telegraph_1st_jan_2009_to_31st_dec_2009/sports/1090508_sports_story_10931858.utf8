                                                     Rohit: I hope Dhoni was watching me
            A STAFF REPORTER            Rohit Sharma                           
	Calcutta: Deccan Chargers Rohit Sharma hopes that his hattrick in the Indian Premier League (IPL) match against the Mumbai Indians was watched by Team India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni as he attempts to cement his place in the national ODI squad.         
	Despite the bundle of talent, Rohit has been in and out of the one-day squad but feels Wednesdays performance would serve as a message to the Team India think-tank.         
	I hope he (Dhoni) has watched the game... Maybe... yes... he may have, Rohit said.         
	His hattrick was spread over two overs and included the wickets of Abhishek Nayar, Harbhajan Singh and JP Duminy.         
	I am a good bowler I have been working hard at my bowling. I didnt get enough opportunities at the international level. I have been bowling well in whatever opportunities I have been getting. I am happy that I came out with a hattrick, Rohit was quoted a saying to the IPLs official website.         
	The 22-year-old Mumbai Ranji player, who was quite surprised bagging the hat-trick, the second in the ongoing IPL after Yuvraj Singhs feat, considered himself lucky.         
	I never thought so, to be honest. I was lucky to get a hattrick. I never thought I would get wickets, so let alone get a hattrick. So it was quite surprising actually, said Rohit.         
	Since his was a split hattrick, Rohit was confused about the hattrick at first and it needed Ryan Harris to inform him about his feat.         
	I really had no clue about it. It was Ryan who informed me and then I started running all over the ground and I enjoyed it, he said.         
	After Wednesdays bowling performance, Rohit feels he could now be called an all-rounder. I think so maybe, you can call me that now, he said.

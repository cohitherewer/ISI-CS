The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Defence continues to worry the Red Devils
                                                                                                                       7                                      Defence continues to worry the Red Devils
                      
	London: Manchester United still have problems in defence as they attempt to close the three-point gap at the top of the Premier League with a victory at Fulham on Saturday.         
	Rio Ferdinand, John Shea, Gary Neville and Wes Brown are still out injured, Nemanja Vidic is carrying a calf strain and United manager Alex Ferguson this week let goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar visit his native Netherlands to have a second opinion on the knee injury that has kept him out for four weeks.         
	Ferguson was hoping to have the veteran back to help his side in their battle with Chelsea at the top of the standings but does not know when he will return. United could be level on points with Chelsea by the time the Blues play at West Ham on Sunday.         
	Edwin is going back to Holland, Ferguson said. It is a change of scenery for him and the Holland team doctor will have a look at the injury. He has never had an injury like this before so we think it is a good idea and expect him back in a couple of days.         
	Fortunately for United, they do not have another Champions League match until the meeting with AC Milan in mid-February and do not face any of their top-four rivals in the domestic league until the Jan. 31 visit to Arsenal. But Saturdays match could still be tricky.         
	Fulham won last seasons corresponding fixture 2-0 on their way to a best-ever topflight finish of seventh and are on a high after reaching the knockout phase of the Europa League this week.         
	Brown and Neville should be fit to return within the next 10 days but Vidics chances of playing will only be clear once Ferguson sees how he reacts to training on Friday. Vidic limped out of Tuesdays 3-0 win over Wolverhampton.         
	Winger Nani is out for another two weeks with an ankle injury, but Ryan Giggs could be fit to return to midfield Saturday after signing a one-year contract extension.         
	Ferdinand and midfielder Owen Hargreaves should return next month.         
	The only thing that is sure is that he will not play on Saturday, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said. Beyond that, it all depends on the scan. Is it a tightness that just presents a small risk on Saturday or is it a slight strain?  
	Saturday rsquo;s matches  
	 Portsmouth vs Liverpool; Aston Villa vs Stoke City; Blackburn Rovers vs Tottenham Hotspur; Fulham vs Manchester United; Manchester City vs Sunderland; Arsenal vs Hull City

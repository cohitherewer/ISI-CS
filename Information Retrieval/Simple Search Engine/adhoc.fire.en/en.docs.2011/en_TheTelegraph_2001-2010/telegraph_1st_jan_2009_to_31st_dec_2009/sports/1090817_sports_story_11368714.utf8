	Bulawayo: Zimbabwes Charles Coventry equalled the highest individual one-day International score Sunday, but saw his big-hitting party gatecrashed by Tamim Iqbal as Bangladesh wrapped up the one-day series here.         
	Coventry blasted an unbeaten 194 to equal former Pakistan opener Saeed Anwars 12-year record as Zimbabwe piled up 312 for eight in their 50 overs, but Bangladesh opener Tamim then hit his countrys highest individual ODI score (154) as the tourists won with 13 balls to spare.         
	I was due for a big innings. I was getting good starts but not big hundreds. It would have felt better had I finished the match, said Tamim.         
	Coventry praised the tourists for their response to the big total.         
	Well done to the Bangladeshis for the way they chased. Well be out there trying the hardest the next time, said the 26-year-old, who was playing in his 15th one-dayer. He dominated Zimbabwes innings with the next highest score, a more modest 37.         
	Coventry hit seven sixes and accelerated from 129 in the 42nd over to 180 in the 47th as fans wondered if he would become the first player in history to hit a one-day International double century. But he had to settle for a share of Anwars record.         
	Coventry shared an 82-run stand for the second wicket with Hamilton Masakadza as the home side eyed levelling the five-match series at 2-2. But 20-year-old left-hander Tamims innings put paid to their hopes. He first made his third half-century of the series before going on to hit his highest score in his 60th ODI. Tamims 154 came off 138 balls with seven fours and six sixes.         
	Zimbabwe captain Prosper Utseya looked for positives in defeat.         
	The innings of 312 wasnt enough. But our game is improving. Were playing international cricket and we missed chances that should have been taken. 3-2 sounds better than 4-1 and we need to come back strong and play well for the fans.         
	Bangladesh captain Shakib-al Hasan said: Tamim batted magnificently, cant get better than that.           (AFP)

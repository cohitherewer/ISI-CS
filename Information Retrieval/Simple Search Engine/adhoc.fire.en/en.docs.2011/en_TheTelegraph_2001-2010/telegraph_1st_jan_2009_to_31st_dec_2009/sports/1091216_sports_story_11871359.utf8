    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  Ace marksman on team India and Sachin             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Rajkot: Abhinav Bindra, Indias only individual gold medallist in the Olympics and a former world No.1 (owing to a long break, hes No.4 now) in shooting, spoke to The Telegraph, the other day, on being at the very top and on cricket.                             Bindra      
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Youre the reigning world and Olympic champion in the 10m rifle. For a period, those successes made you the No.1. Were you, at any time, conscious of that?         
	A For me, winning a world title or an Olympic gold is more important than having a particular ranking... Rankings probably glorify the sport, thats it... In shooting, rankings started in 2005 and, today, they matter because of Wada... The top-ranked shooters come under scrutiny... (After a pause) Im not obsessed with rankings, but they exist in black and white.         
	Keen on cricket, whats your take on Team India becoming No.1 in Tests?         
	Its absolutely fantastic... Test cricket is, after all, the purest form of the sport... It would be great to have a World Test Championship and that would make the rankings more meaningful... The Australians are no longer No.1 in Tests, but Ive been an admirer... Theyre No.1 in the ODIs, but had briefly slipped from that position... That, however, didnt reduce my admiration for a country which has won three World Cups in a row...         
	What has been the difference between this Indian team and others of the past?         
	Weve seen a progression... There are many aspects to this climb, one being that todays generation is more confident and more aggressive... Is far more competitive... Then, facilities have improved and there are many in the support staff to help... Also, besides the senior pros, some good players have worn the India colours in the past few years... Theyve brought quite a few things to the table.         
	Did you follow the recent Brabourne Test, after which we became No.1?         
	(Excitedly) I did... I watched (Virender) Sehwags innings of 293... What I admire about him is that he plays his natural game, whatever be the situation... He may not do well all the time, but doesnt change his approach... Sehwags consistent with his style of play.         
	Having been a No.1, what would you tell Team India?         
	Offer my congratulations, first... I assume theyll always be playing to win, so I wont have to say much, really.         
	Isnt retaining the No.1 position possibly tougher than getting there?         
	Shouldnt be a problem if you play to win and, in that process, achieve a high degree of consistency.         
	Surely, theres more pressure on a No.1?         
	There is... I mean, you cant go any further... The only way, then, is down... When youre the best, you can try to get better, but you cant have a higher ranking than No.1... So, theres definitely pressure...         
	You hold the biggest titles, but arent the No.1 today. How will you handle pressure in 2010, the year of the World Championships (in Munich) and the Commonwealth Games (in New Delhi)?         
	I look at it differently... To talk of the Commonwealth Games, I already have six medals from such competitions and will be looking to enjoy myself... Ill be looking to prepare to the best of my ability... That, indeed, is the bottomline... In terms of preparations, I need to be at my best mentally, physically and tactically... If Im ready in all respects, the result will take care of itself... I detach myself from the outcome... Of course, Ill definitely be backing myself.         
	Sachin Tendulkar has been one of your heroes. When did you meet him for the first time?         
	During the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Malaysia... I remember requesting him to pose for a photograph... I still have it...         
	What did you tell him?         
	Not much, it was rushed... The first time that we really talked was during a recent awards function (in Mumbai)... Sachin wanted to know what had been my thoughts going into the last shot in Beijing.         
	So, what did you say?         
	That Id been aggressive in the mind... That I badly wanted to score and take the gold medal.         
	Which is the last Sachin innings that caught your attention?         
	The one in Hyderabad recently, against Australia... Sachin scored 175... Id been training in Germany, so had to follow it on the net.         
	Besides Sachin, who is the one cricketer youd pay to watch?         
	Nobody, perhaps... It was during the 1996 World Cup that Sachins performance (523 runs in seven matches) attracted me to cricket... Nobody has mattered more... I havent looked beyond Sachin, so I dont know what will happen when he retires!         
	Any thoughts on the present captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni?         
	Look, any captain is as good as his team... Dhoni is fortunate to have such good players under him... Hes been successful... Comes across as calm... If the going becomes rough, we should be patient and let him be...         
	Should something like T20 come into shooting?         
	(Laughs) We have that, for example, in the Bundesliga... Instead of 60, the competition is limited to 40 shots. The biggest difference is in the atmosphere... Its open to spectators and theyre allowed to cheer their favourites... Can get very noisy... Takes time to get used to it.         
	How should success and the money which comes with it, one example being through the IPL, be handled?         
	Youve got to accept that there will be good days and bad... Enjoy your moment of success, but dont allow it to go to your head... Bear in mind that nothing lasts forever.         
	The last one: In a few days, your 16-month break from competitive shooting will end... A new journey, then, is about to begin...         
	Actually, after Beijing, I wanted to quit... I went through different emotions and I wanted the true answer to come from within... Didnt force anything on myself...

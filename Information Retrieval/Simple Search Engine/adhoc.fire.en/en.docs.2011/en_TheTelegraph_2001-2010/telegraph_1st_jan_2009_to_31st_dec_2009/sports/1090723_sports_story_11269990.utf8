                                                   Gambhir: Its difficult to maintain consistency
                      
	New Delhi: Despite his meteoric rise to the top of the International Cricket Council (ICC) Test batting charts, India opener Gautam Gambhir admitted that maintaining consistency is becoming increasingly difficult given the hectic international schedule these days.         
	The elegant left-hander said failures were bound to come by, as players need to constantly change their mindset from one format to the other in the cramped calendar.         
	Nowadays we are playing so much cricket and that also in three different formats Its difficult to perform consistently because we play so much of cricket, Gambhir said on Wednesday.         
	The 27-year-old opener, who made his international debut in November 2004 against Australia, was, nonetheless, excited about his numero uno status in Test rankings as well as the news of being recommended for the Arjuna Awards, both coming in a space of one week.         
	No one can expect to reach the top so soon and no one can plan it either. It just happens. But its really very exciting to be on top, Gambhir said.           (PTI)

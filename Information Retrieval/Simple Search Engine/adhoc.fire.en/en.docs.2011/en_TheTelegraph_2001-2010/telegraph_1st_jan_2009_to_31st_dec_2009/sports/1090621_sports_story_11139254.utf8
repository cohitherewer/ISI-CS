                                                     Got to prove I can still perform: Bond
                  Bond                     
	Christchurch: After parting ways with the rebel Indian Cricket League, fast bowler Shane Bond is now determined to play for New Zealand again and eyeing a gradual comeback to the national team.         
	The 34-year-bowler, who once expressed his unwillingness to don the national colours again, has clearly changed mind after his stint with the ICL ended last month.         
	Ive spoken to (selection panel manager) Glenn Turner and said Im available to be picked but I expect to be picked on merit, like everyone else. But Ive got to get cricket behind me and prove I can still perform, Bond said.         
	New Zealand would tour Sri Lanka in August-September, around the same time an A team is expected to visit India and the speedy is hopeful of a berth in either of them.         
	I hoped that through my domestic cricket it perhaps put me into consideration for an A tour. If it didnt then Id try and do my time in first-class cricket and get back that way, Bond said.         
	I still felt I was the fastest bowler going around, but I wasnt in the best condition and have made a real concerted effort to pick my fitness up, he added. (PTI)

	Aged 39 years and 212 days, Jayasuriya became the oldest to score an ODI hundred. The previous oldest was Englands Geoffrey Boycott who scored a century at 39 years 51 days when he scored 105 versus Australia in Sydney on December 11, 1979. This was Jayasuriyas 28th ODI hundred and seventh against India.         
	This is also Jayasuriyas 12th century after the age of 35. The next best performance after 35 is five centuries each by Gordon Greenidge, Matthew Hayden and Zaheer Abbas.         
	Jaysuriyas hundred is only the second scored at this ground in 26 ODIs. The only other player to score a hundred at this ground is Rahul Dravid (104) vs UAE on July 16, 2004.

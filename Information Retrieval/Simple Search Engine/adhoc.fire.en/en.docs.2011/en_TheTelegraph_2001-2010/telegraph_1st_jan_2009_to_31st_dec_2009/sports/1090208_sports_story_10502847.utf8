                                                   Churchill blank United SC 
                      
	Margao: Felix Chimaokwu starred with a brace in Churchill Brothers 3-0 win over Chirag United in the 14th round of the ONGC I-League at Nehru Stadium here Saturday.         
	The Goan team, who led 2-0 at half-time, scored through Ogba Kalu Nnanna (17th) and Man of the Match Chimaokwu (44th, 69th minutes). Churchill Brothers hardly felt the absence of their prolific striker Odafe Okolie as Bineesh Balan combined well with Chimaokwu upfront.         
	Nnanna controlled the midfield well and opened the score for his team in the 17th minute when he headed home a well-directed pass by Khan Thang Paite from a flag kick.         
	Earlier, Chimankwu had the first chance to give the Goans an early lead but he ended up shooting straight at keeper Somnath Khara.         
	However he made amends for the miss and doubled his teams lead in the 44th minute with a curling shot from a free kick that hit the post before sneaking in.         
	Chimankwu sealed United SCs fate when he slotted home a low cross by Bineesh Balan. (PTI)

                                                     Kaneria takes 5
  - Pakistan spinners run riot as hosts lose last five wickets for only 69 runs             Danish Kaneria in action against Sri Lanka, in Colombo, on Tuesday. (Reuters)                           
	Colombo: Pakistan took an 82-run lead against Sri Lanka in the third Test match after Danish Kaneria bagged five wickets to restrict the hosts first innings to a modest score.         
	Pakistan reached 16 for one at close of play on the second day. It made 299 in the first innings before dismissing Sri Lanka for 233.         
	Opener Khurram Manzoor (2) was out bowled by Rangana Herath. Fawad Alam and captain Younis Khan were at the crease.         
	Sri Lanka lost their last five wickets for 69 runs in the post-tea session despite Mahela Jayawardenes 79 runs and his 71-run partnership for the fifth wicket with Anjelo Mathews (31) that lifted the team from 82 for four.         
	Captain Kumar Sangakkara contributed 45.         
	It was the wicket of Sangakkara just before lunch that tilted the scales in Pakistans favour.         
	Sangakkara had been reprieved twice.         
	Twice, Manzoor could have had him off Mohammed Aamers bowling.         
	The first chance went to him at face-height at gully, while the second brushed his outstretched fingertips and went for four.         
	The first reprieve was especially costly, with Pakistan right on top of proceedings.         
	Off-spinner Saeed Ajmal took three wickets for 70 runs while Kaneria returned best figures of five for 62, his 13th five-wicket innings haul.         
	Kaneria, who had been overlooked for the first two matches of the series, triggered the collapse after tea, trapping Chaminda Vaas leg before for seven runs. Jayawardene faced 153 balls and hit 10 boundaries for his runs before being bowled by a Kaneria delivery that hurried from the pitch.         
	Kaneria later trapped Herath leg before, and had Tillekaratne Dilshan caught behind by wicket-keeper Kamran Akmal.         
	Dilshan came to bat at No.8 instead of his usual No. 6 position because of a fractured finger, and he was also cut in the eyebrow after being hit by a ball. Dilshan did not take the field on the second day after suffering an injury to his right hand on day one.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mortaza debut today
                                                   Mortaza debut today
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mashrafe Mortaza is set to make his debut for the Kolkata Knight Riders against the Deccan Chargers in Johannesburg on Saturday.         
	The Bangladesh all-rounder, who went for a whopping $600,000 at this years auction, will make the XI in place of Angelo Mathews. The team management deemed it fit not to field the Bangladesh strike bowler for 11 games despite their shoddy performance.         
	Brad Hodge, who missed the Knight Riders last match against the Royal Challengers Bangalore, will return in place of Ajantha Mendis.         
	Captain Brendon McCullum and David Hussey would be the other two foreigners in the side. Though a system of rotation has been put in place, there were no indications till late on Friday that any of the big guns would be dropped.         
	Anureet Singh is also certain to make a comeback after missing most of the tournament because of an injury suffered in the early stages. However, it wasnt clear whose place he would take although Ajit Agarkar could get the boot.         
	With nine defeats in 11 matches so far, the Knight Riders have nothing to lose and will be playing for pride, expecting to cause a few upsets to further spice up the semi-final race.         
	The outfit can take heart from the fact that their batting has at last clicked with captain McCullum returning to form with an unbeaten 84 off 64 balls to take his side to their highest score of 173 in this edition, against the Royal Challengers on Tuesday. Husseys return has also added some much-needed stability to the middle-order.         
	The Deccan Chargers will be hoping to cash in on the Knight Riders horrid form to take themselves a step closer to the semi-finals.

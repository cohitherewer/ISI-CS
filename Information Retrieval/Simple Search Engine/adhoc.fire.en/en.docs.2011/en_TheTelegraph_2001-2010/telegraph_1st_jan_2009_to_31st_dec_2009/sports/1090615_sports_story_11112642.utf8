The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Needed this victory, says Sangakkara
                                                   Needed this victory, says Sangakkara
                      
	London: Ireland have gone from strength to strength at the World T20 and Sunday, despite their eventual loss, the minnows gave quite a fright to mighty Sri Lanka. The Lankans would have had the ignominy of posting a meagre total and then handing a handsome and memorable victory to the Irish had it not been for Mahela Jayawardene with the bat and Muttiah Muralidharan and Lasith Malinga with the ball.         
	Lanka meet New Zealand next, on Tuesday and a loss to Ireland would have seriously jeopardised their campaign. Kumar Sangakkaras men have won all their matches so far and defeat to Ireland would have been a blow to their confidence.         
	We had to win, Sangakkara said. There was a hint of desperation in the Lanka captains voice after the match. But he confessed that during it his teams performance was far from satisfactory. We probably lacked a bit of intensity, is what Sangakkara had to say. The wicketkeeper batsman credited Jayawardene and the bowlers for the outcome. The way Mahela batted was brilliant the bowling was spot on.         
	The Irish captain William Porterfield knew how close they were to an inspiring win. We bowled and fielded well but couldnt quite pull through.         
	The Irish might be greenhorns but there are some match-winners in their side. Sundays hero was Alex Cusack whose three overs yielded 18 runs and four wickets. Thus, despite the loss, their performance at Lords has given them reason to be hopeful.

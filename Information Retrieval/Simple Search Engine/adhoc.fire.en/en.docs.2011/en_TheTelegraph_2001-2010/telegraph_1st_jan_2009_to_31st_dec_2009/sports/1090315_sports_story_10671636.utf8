                                                   Bowlers need to improve, says Tiwary
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Zone captain Manoj Tiwary lauded his teams efforts after their emphatic win against North Zone in the Deodhar Trophy match on Saturday at the Barabati Stadium in Cuttack but said there is room for improvement in the bowling department.         
	It was a great victory, especially because we won the bonus point, too. All our plans and strategies worked brilliantly today, Tiwary told The Telegraph over phone.         
	Showering praise on the teams batsmen, the captain said: All batsmen except me played well. Its heartening to see every body contributing.         
	The pacers bowled well but there is still a lot of room for improvement, he remarked.         
	Tiwary felt North Zone made a mistake in asking East to bat after winning the toss. He said: We were surprised to see them opt to field after winning the toss. I think they failed to judge the wicket.         
	East Zone coach Samir Dighe gave all the credit for the win to the players.         
	See, the credit is not mine. Its a collective effort from the boys and they should be get the credit, the former India wicketkeeper said.         
	The zonal team is comprised of players from different states. The way Manoj has handled the boys is superb. The combination of the team and the dressing room atmosphere have been great. We hope to continue in this fashion in the rest of the matches, he added.

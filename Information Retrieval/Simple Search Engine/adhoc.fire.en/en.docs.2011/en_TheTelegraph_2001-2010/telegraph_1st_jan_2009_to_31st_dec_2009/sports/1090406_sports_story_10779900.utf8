	Calcutta: Al Kuwait SC, Mohun Bagans AFC Cup opponents in the third round, arrived in the city Sunday evening. The two teams face off on Tuesday at the Howrah Stadium.         
	The club, who have won the Kuwaiti Premier League 10 times, currently share the lead with Al Weehdat of Jordan in Group D with four points from two matches.         
	Kuwait SCs coach Dragan said that they expect tough competition from Mohun Bagan and are not taking the match lightly. We have some idea about Mohun Bagan. They are a good side and I think its going to be a difficult match, he said.         
	Speaking on their chances in the AFC Cup, the Serbian coach said: We are currently enjoying a good place in the points table. But that doesnt guarantee anything. We need to play well to advance to the next round and I hope we put up a good show in Calcutta.         
	Meanwhile, Mohun Bagan looked a worried lot during practice at the club ground on Sunday. Keyman Jose Ramirez Barreto and goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee are down with viral fever and that is quite a concern for coach Karim Bencharifa. The Moroccan sounded hopeful about Barretos availability on Tuesday but was not too sure about Sangram.         
	The coach, who had earlier said that the I-League was much more important than the AFC Cup, said that he was concentrating on Tuesdays match. We have to perform well in the remaining matches to keep alive our chances of progressing to the next round, he said. Mohun Bagan have lost both their matches, against Al Karamah of Syria and Al Wehdat, in the tournament so far.

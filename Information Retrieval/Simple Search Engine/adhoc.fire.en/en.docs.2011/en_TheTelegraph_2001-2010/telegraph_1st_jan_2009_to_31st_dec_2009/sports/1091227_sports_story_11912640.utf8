The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Soccer lets money and hope flourish

    - Magical Messis essence is that he is a team player             ROB HUGHES            Lionel Messi                                 
	Soccer seemed to defy financial gravity in 2009. While much of the world buckled into recession, Fifa, the sports governing body, declared that each of the 32 nations that qualified for the 2010 World Cup would receive financial rewards 60 percent higher than ever before.         
	Working on similar lines, Real Madrid paid Manchester United about $132 million for Cristiano Ronaldo. That was only the transfer sum; the salary is $15 million a year extra. But Madrid reckons that it is a viable deal, and, like every other club in the Champions League, can start reducing its debts through prize money that is guaranteed to be 33 percent more over this and the next three seasons.         
	This is because soccers big television and sponsorship deals are locked into the period of prosperity that existed before the global financial crash. The recession may hit the sport down the road. But soccer lives for the now, and if there are bankruptcies in the system, none of them have been declared during 2009.         
	But if Ronaldo is worth so much, what price should be put on Lionel Messi? This has been his year, Barcelonas year and Spains year.         
	Messi, the little man from Argentina, has eclipsed Ronaldo for the Player of the Year titles in 2009. His essence is that he is a team player, and his team, Barcelona, has garnered all the trophies available to one club in one season. Not only that, Barcelona has raised the game back to beauty.         
	With Messi down either wing, with Xavi picking out passes as if by the instinct of a homing pigeon, with Andrs Iniesta and Thierry Henry, and now with Zlatan Ibrahimovic replacing Samuel Eto as the focal point of attack, it has a style so easy on the eye, yet also so competitive.         
	Madrid has support from the Spanish institutions prepared to help it pay more than its means to try to ensure that Barcelona does not keep running away with all the prizes. Madrids policy was to buy  not just Ronaldo, but also Kak, Karim Benzema, Xabi Alonso and others in a single summer.         
	What it cannot buy is the roots of Barcas beauty, its renowned style. That is a product of La Masia, the school built on an 18th century farm in the lea of the clubs Nou Camp.         
	The player who has passed through La Masia has something different to the rest, Coach Josep Guardiola said. Its a plus that comes from having competed in a Barcelona shirt from the time you were a child.         
	Guardiola knows, because he passed through the school and played for the first team for a decade before graduating to be its coach. One of his players, the meticulous Xavi, has just played his 500th senior game in the shirt.         
	Xavi is a born and bred Catalan, a child and now a man of F.C. Barcelona. But though Messi was born abroad, Txiki Begiristain, the clubs technical director, insists, Messs from Argentina, but he was formed in our house. Indeed he was, from age 13.         
	That raises the conundrum of 2009. Messi scored the winning goal in extra time Saturday in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, as Barcelona defeated Estudiantes de la Plata of Argentina, 2-1. He was the star of stars wherever Barcelona performed, yet he could barely shine for his homeland. He could look like a boy indulging in a great fantasy even in the Champions League final in Rome, but he shrank whenever he pulled on the blue and white stripes of Argentina.         
	The reason must be Diego Maradona. Once the greatest star of Argentina  and, incidentally, of Barcelona for a time  Maradona took his national squad to the brink of lunacy in his first year of attempted team management. A novice coach, inconsistent and unwilling to listen to advice, he never picked the same line-up twice and came within a hairs breadth of failing to reach the World Cup.         
	Csar Menotti, the coach of Argentinas 1978 World Cup-winning side, spelled it out in two sentences: Argentina does not have a functioning team. Messi is not responsible for the strategy at Barcelona, he is the one that completes the moves.         
	The star, yes, but the star of a fantastically integrated team.                 NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Proteas take 2-1 lead
                                                   Proteas take 2-1 lead
                      
	Sydney: David Warners blitzkrieg went in vain as South Africa edged out Australia by three wickets in the third one-day International to take a 2-1 lead in the five-match cricket series here on Friday.         
	South Africa first bowled out the hosts for 269 in 49.2 overs before going on to overwhelm the target with 21 balls to spare in a keenly contested match under floodlights. Warner top-scored for Australia with a 60-ball 69, adding 114 runs in about 18 overs with fellow opener Shaun Marsh (43).         
	South Africa rode on significant contributions from Herschelle Gibbs (64), Jacques Kallis (60), Albie Morkel (40) and Mark Boucher (31 not out) to reach 270 for seven in 46.3 overs. Both the teams now move to Adelaide for the fourth ODI on Monday.         
	South Africa stumbled early in their chase as Hashim Amla (13), dropped in the slips by Ricky Ponting in the first over, was run out.         
	In that eventful first over, bowled by a hapless Shaun Tait, David Hussey dropped Gibbs on no score at point as well and it proved to be costly in the end.         
	Gibbs struck form on Friday and with Kallis too putting his foot down, the veteran duo milked the Australian attack with consummate ease, scoring at a healthy rate.         
	They had added 104 runs for the second wicket when Mitchell Johnson removed Gibbs and that triggered a mini collapse with South Africa losing the crucial wickets of AB de Villiers (5), JP Duminy (9) and Kallis. From 125 for one, South Africa suddenly found their top half blown away with the score reading 165.         
	Gibbss 52-ball 64 had 10 fours and a six in it while Kallis 72-ball 60 included five hits to the fence.         
	Neil McKenzie (27) and Boucher then arrested the slide and Albie Morkel played a crucial cameo as South Africa romped home.         
	Earlier, on a good batting track at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Ricky Ponting didnt hesitate to bat first after winning the toss and he soon had reasons to feel vindicated.         
	Warner and Marsh gave Australia a blazing start and the South African bowlers had no clue how to tame Warner.         
	Dale Steyn eventually dismissed Warner in the 19th over when the left-hander attempted a heave only to see his timbers rattled.

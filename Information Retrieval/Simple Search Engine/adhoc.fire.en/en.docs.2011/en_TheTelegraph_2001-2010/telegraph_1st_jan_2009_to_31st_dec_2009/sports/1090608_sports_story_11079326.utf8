The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Blistering start by the Proteas
                                                   Blistering start by the Proteas
                      
	London: South Africa made a blistering start to their Twenty20 World Cup campaign, beating Scotland by 130 runs on Sunday to qualify for the Super Eight stage.         
	AB de Villiers hit 79 not out off 34 balls, smashing six sixes and five boundaries to help South Africa post 211 for five at The Oval  their highest Twenty20 score and the fifth best in the short history of the format.         
	Openers Jacques Kallis made 48 and Graeme Smith 38, while Albie Morkel scored 24 in 11 balls.         
	Credit to the openers, because they gave us a platform to go out and express ourselves, De Villiers said. We had good fun out there today.         
	Scotland never looked like chasing it down, slumping to 13 for four before being bowled out for 81 in the 16th over with only Kyle Coetzer (42) and Majid Haq (15) reaching double figures. Morkel took two for 15, while spinners Johan Botha and Roelof van der Merwe each took two for 17 and Dale Steyn two for 21.         
	South Africa play New Zealand at Lords on Tuesday. Scotland have been eliminated from the tournament.         
	Today was just about confronting early tournament nerves and playing high-intensity cricket, Smith said. (We) probably had a few more nerves after watching the opening few days of the tournament, but we knew today was about sending a message. I think the first six overs and the last six overs of the innings are crucial, and with someone like AB at the crease, youre always going to get a big total.         
	Scotland captain Gavin Hamilton won the toss, but his decision to field looked rash as Kallis hit five fours in a single over. The Scots didnt help themselves with some erratic fielding. Kallis was dropped on 43 when he chipped a ball from Glenn Rogers to Hamilton, who initially took the catch but then lost control of the ball as he hit the ground.         
	Haq briefly halted the South African charge when he removed both openers in the space of three balls in the 10th over. Kallis dragged a delivery on to his stumps to make it 87 for one. Smith was out attempting to sweep, the ball looped into the air, wicketkeeper Colin Smith took the catch.         
	Herschelle Gibbs was stumped for 16 off Ryan Watson, making it 125 for three in the 15th over, but De Villiers and Morkel reignited the innings with a 50-run partnership from only 19 balls.         
	The pair hit 22 from the 17th over before Morkel was caught by Coetzer off Gordon Drummond for 24 in the 18th over. De Villiers reached his 50 from 25 balls.         
	In the final over, Coetzer produced a diving catch to remove Mark Boucher for two, but De Villiers responded with two successive sixes.         
	Scotland made a disastrous start to their reply. Watson was bowled by Steyn           (AP)

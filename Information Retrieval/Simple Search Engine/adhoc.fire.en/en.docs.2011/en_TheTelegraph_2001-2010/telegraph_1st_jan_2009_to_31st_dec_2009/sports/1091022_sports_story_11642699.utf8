                                                     Not over the moon: Subrata
            A STAFF REPORTER            Subrata Paul                           
	Calcutta: Subrata Paul, the 2009 Indian Footballer of the Year, is happy but not over the moon for becoming the first goalkeeper to get the prestigious award. Yeah, its a good feeling to win the award. Nice to become the first goalkeeper (to have won it) but I am not going overboard. I have seen enough in life. Now these things dont matter to me anymore, the India goalkeeper told The Telegraph from Pune on Wednesday.         
	But isnt recognition a big impetus for moving ahead in life? True. But, at the same time, if you are carried away just by the recognition, it doesnt count after some years. I have to perform consistently well and win many such awards, the Pune FC goalkeeper said.         
	The Indian Footballer of the Year Award, which was instituted by the AIFF in 1992, never had a goalkeeper hitting jackpot. It has been a strikers award. Isnt it? Hopefully its not the last time a goalkeeper wins it. he said laughing.         
	Paul said his match-winning performance in the Nehru Cup final against Syria last August could have helped him in winning the award. I feel so. May be that performance (he saved three shots in the tieb-breaker) tilted the balance in my favour, he said.         
	Just some months ago Paul was branded by East Bengal as a goalkeeper fit only for the national team and not for club football. This award once again proved how wrong the Calcutta club were in releasing him. The red and gold brigade, who won their first match of the season on Wednesday, has been undone by some poor goalkeeping and Pauls presence under the bar could have been a boost for the team. I dont want to get into that controversy again. I am happy playing for Pune FC (PFC), he said.         
	Pauls main target now is to shine for the newly promoted club in the I-League and would like a mid-table finish. We have to win matches. Saturday we are playing Mahindra United at home and we are confident that our first win will come there, he said. He feels that the teams bench is not strong enough. But I am sure our coach (Derreck Perreira) will overcome that problem.         
	So what is his take on the October 25 Calcutta derby? Its a 50-50 match. But I have a feeling that the artificial turf will be the decisive factor. .         
	But how will he feel sitting far away in Pune when the city clubs cross swords. I will watch, definitely. But the feeling wont be good, he signed off with a tinge of sadness.

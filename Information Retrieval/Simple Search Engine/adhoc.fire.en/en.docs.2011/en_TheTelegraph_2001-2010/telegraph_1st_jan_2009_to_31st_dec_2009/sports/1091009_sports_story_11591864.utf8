The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jordan told to stub   it out 
                                                     Jordan told to stub   it out 
                  Michael Jordan                           
	San Francisco: Basketball great Michael Jordan has been told to butt out if he wants to continue to be part of the US Presidents Cup team that will take on the Internationals at Harding Park Golf Course.         
	After seeing a picture of Jordan puffing on a cigar in a Tuesday daily, city officials asked the PGA Tour to remind the basketball legend who is in the Hall of Fame that there is no smoking allowed on public golf courses, including Harding Park.         
	Ive already sent off an email to the PGA Tour director, city recreation and park general manager Phil Ginsburg said.         
	It was sort of a gentle nudge reminding them that smoking is illegal and that we would appreciate their support.         
	The cigar-chomping Jordan, who has joined the US squad as a special assistant, could face a $100 fine if he is again seen smoking on the course.         
	Asked by the PGA Tour.com how many cigars he planned to smoke during the tournament, Jordan was faced with the prospect of going cold turkey.         
	I heard this is a public place so they limit what you can smoke, said Jordan. Im not even suppose to be smoking but this was a practice round and no one said anything.         
	Jordan, who led the Chicago Bulls to six NBA championships and is considered by many the greatest basketball player of all time, was appointed by Couples to be an assistant assistant for this weeks matches.         
	Hes been to every Presidents Cup and Ryder Cup that Ive played in, said former world No. 1 Couples. Hes extremely passionate about the game of golf. I believe he can bring something to our team.         
	He has won six NBA championships, been MVP of the league forever. Hes dealt with teammates that were phenomenal players and maybe teammates that couldnt play for another team. I think he may be able to instil something to my team.         
	Jordan, who plays golf off a single-digit handicap, is a good friend of world No. 1 Tiger Woods with whom he occasionally plays practice rounds.         
	Kenny Perry is looking forward to spending time with the 46-year-old Jordan in the US locker room at Harding Park.         
	Its going to be cool just to hang around with that cat, just to be able to go up and shake his hand and listen to his stories, said the 49-year-old Perry.         
	I want to hear some NBA stories; I dont want to hear no golf stories.           (REUTERS)

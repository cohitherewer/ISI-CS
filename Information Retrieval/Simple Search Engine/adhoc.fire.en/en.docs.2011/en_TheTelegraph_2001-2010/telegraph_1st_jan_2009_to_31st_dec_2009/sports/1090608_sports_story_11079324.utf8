The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pragyan owes it to IPL
                                                   Pragyan owes it to IPL
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nottingham: Man of the Match Pragyan Ojha spoke to the media after Indias 25-run victory against Bangladesh in their opening match in the World Twenty20 on Saturday.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	His performance         
	Thanks to IPL I bowled quite well in the IPL, so I had a lot of confidence in myself and I backed myself. We are the defending champions so when you get into the team there is a lot of responsibility on you. I feel great that whatever faith my coach and captain had on me, I was able to stand by it.         
	The cold conditions         
	I think it was quite chilly but I did learn to bowl in cold conditions in South Africa. Actually I was here a couple of years ago just for one month and then I had to go back to India. It was cold then too.         
	The main contributors to the victory         
	I think everyone contributed equally and especially Yuvibhai with the bat and in the field as well.         
	His strategy against the onslaught in T20         
	Obviously, Twenty20 is a batsmans game. So I think they will try to dominate but I try to stay cool and back myself. I think varying the pace is important and I feel when I flight the ball it helps me a lot.         
	Indias planning         
	We are taking it match by match. There is nothing special that we were planning Just that we were playing Bangladesh and we had to win.         
	The decision to play two spinners         
	It was the management, coach and captains decision to play two spinners. It was helping a bit when you were bowling a bit slow. Their spinners also got a bit of help when they bowled.         
	His thoughts when he came on to bowl         
	Not really, I just had a blank mind. I didnt think about anything. I just wanted to come and bowl. It was my debut and I didnt want to put pressure on myself. I wanted to bowl the way I have been bowling.         
	Sehwags injury         
	We hope he is back because he is one of the best batsmen in the world. We are looking forward to see him back.

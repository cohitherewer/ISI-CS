                                                     Sania   enters second round
                  Sania Mirza                           
	Pattaya: Sania Mirza of India rallied from a break down in both sets to overcome unheralded Nicha Lertpitaksinchai of Thailand 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 on Tuesday to reach the second round of the Pattaya Open.         
	Mirza trailed 3-5 in both sets against the 945th-ranked Nicha before winning in just under two hours.         
	She didnt play like she is 945. She hit like she is in the top 50, Mirza said. Its always difficult to play with someone you dont know in the first round. But Im happy to raise my level and pull through.         
	In other matches, second-seeded Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark shook off a slow start to beat Chan Yung-jan of Taiwan 6-3, 6-0.         
	No. 1 seed Vera Zvonareva of Russia beat Slovenias Andreja Klepac 6-4, 6-3 while fourth seed Sybille Bammer of Austria defeated Polands Urszula Radwanska 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 in three sets.         
	Yuliya Beygelzimer of Ukraine beat Anastasia Rodionova of Russia 6-2, 6-2 and Neuza Silva of Portugal defeated Jessica More of Australia 6-2, 6-1.         
	Yaroslava Shedova of Kazakhstan also advanced, beating Tamira Paszek of Austria 6-3, 6-4 and Ivana Lisjak of Croatia stopped qualifier Sesil Karatancheva of Kazakhstan 6-2, 4-6, 6-3.         
	Incidentally, Sania had pulled out of the Fed Cup Asia/Oceania zone tie citing an abdominal injury.         
	She suffered the injury during her Australian Open campaign, according to the All India Tennis Association.         
	Last year also, Sania did not play the Fed Cup matches though she was part of the team.         
	On Monday Sania improved her ranking by a place to climb to 126 on the singles chart in the WTA rankings released on Monday. In doubles Sania moved up two places to 70.         
	Sania became the first Indian woman to claim a Grand Slam when she won the Australian mixed doubles title last month with Mahesh Bhupathi. She crashed out of the Australian Open singles after losing to Russian Nadia Petrova in the second round.

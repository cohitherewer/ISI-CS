The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC wary of the windfall
                                                   ICC wary of the windfall
                      
	Mumbai: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has warned about the potential downside of the inflow of huge amounts of money into cricket and said unregulated cash flow could harm the development of the game.         
	In his annual report for 2008-09, ICCs Chief Executive Haroon Lorgat has said while the ICC welcomed innovation and enterprise in taking the game to new audiences, they must be done in a manner that benefited the game.         
	Today, we can say with some confidence that cricket has reached unprecedented heights, particularly in terms of the numbers of people playing and watching all three formats. This can only bode well for the games long-term development and success, Lorgat said in his annual report.         
	With success and opportunity, we should also be aware of the potential pitfalls. Only by dealing with these challenges directly can we be assured that the game will continue to grow.         
	We have witnessed unprecedented flows of money into the game. Sponsors have understood the tremendous potential of a captive audience. With 104 members, cricket is now played in more than 70 per cent of the world, he said.         
	While we welcome the tremendous financial investments in the game, we must be conscious that the unregulated flow of cash could present a myriad of hitherto unrealised issues, Lorgat warned.

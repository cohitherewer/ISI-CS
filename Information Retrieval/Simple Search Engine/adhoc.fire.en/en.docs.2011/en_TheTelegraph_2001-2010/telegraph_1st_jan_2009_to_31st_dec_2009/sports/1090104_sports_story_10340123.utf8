                                                   Captain Bhutia appeal to Patel
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The first interaction between the acting president of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) Praful Patel and national team captain Bhaichung Bhutia, in Goa on Saturday, resulted in a renewal of hope for the players.         
	Bhutia decided to speak out on behalf of the players when Patel made his first visit to the national camp to meet the chief coach Bob Houghton and his wards.         
	Bhutia said that there were many issues regarding the welfare of the players that were yet to be addressed and requested the president to resolve them as soon as possible.         
	The Indian team is currently preparing for their one-off friendly against Hong Kong to be played on January 14.         
	Patel, who is also the union minister for civil aviation, gave Bhutia a patient hearing and promised to look into the issues after the team returned from Hong Kong.         
	Bhutia later said he would take up issues like recognition of Football Players Association of India (FPAI) and model contract for professional players. The ace striker felt that the federation has dilly-dallied in recognising the players association.

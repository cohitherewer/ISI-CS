	Milan: Shaggy-haired Stevan Jovetic lit up a largely predictable Champions League night with both goals in Fiorentinas surprise 2-0 win over Liverpool on Tuesday.         
	The Montenegro striker, only playing in the Group E clash because Alberto Gilardino was suspended, beat the offside trap to net the 28th minute opener and then touched in a cross at the near post nine minutes later to stun the five-times winners.         
	I am very happy, to score two goals against Liverpool is a big thing, he told Italian television after ending a tough period for Fiorentina, who lost their group opener. Club president Andrea Della Valle also resigned last week.         
	While Jovetic was bursting onto the scene in Florence, Lionel Messi was reaffirming his position at the very top of the world game with a typically stylish strike in Barcelonas 2-0 home win over Dynamo Kiev.         
	Dynamo had their chances, with Andriy Shevchenko blasting over on his 33rd birthday, but Pedro sealed Barcas win with some more nifty footwork on 76 minutes.         
	The holders top Group F with four points from two games after Champions League debutants Rubin Kazan were unlucky to only draw 1-1 with 10-man Inter Milan in Russia.         
	Argentine forward Alejandro Dominguez put the hosts ahead when he surged past Lucio to fire home and although Dejan Stankovic pegged them back, Mario Balotellis second-half dismissal left the stuttering Italian champions clinging on.         
	Given the circumstances of the game, It is a point gained. Our opponents started better, they pressed and had their fans urging them on as it was their home debut, coach Jose Mourinho said after Inters seventh Champions League game without a win.         
	Arsenal had to wait until the last 12 minutes to seal a 2-0 home win over Olympiakos Piraeus in Group H with forwards Robin van Persie and Andrei Arshavin on the scoresheet while AZ Alkmaar drew 1-1 with Standard Liege in a Benelux battle.         
	Standard substitute Moussa Traore scrambled in the equaliser in stoppage time to leave both sides on one point.         
	Group E leaders Olympique Lyon plundered a 4-0 victory at Hungarys Debrecen after Kim Kallstrom had slammed in from the edge of the area on three minutes to start the rout.         
	Sevilla were also in goals, notching up a 4-1 win at Rangers in Group G after Abdoulay Konkos finish early in the second half had set them on their way to six points from two games. Romanias Unirea Urziceni, making their home debut in the competition, had a Dacian Varga equaliser to thank from their 1-1 draw with VfB Stuttgart in the same group.

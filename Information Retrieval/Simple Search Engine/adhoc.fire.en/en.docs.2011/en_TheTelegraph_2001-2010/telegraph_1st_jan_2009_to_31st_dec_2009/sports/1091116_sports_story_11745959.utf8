                                                                                                                                     Dhoni is hoping for Tendulkar century
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Dhoni in Ahmedabad on Sunday                           
	Ahmedabad: Mahendra Singh Dhoni is hoping Sachin Tendulkar will score a hundred in the first Test against Sri Lanka to make completing of 20 years in international cricket memorable.         
	That will be the ultimate, the Team India captain said at a press conference on the eve of the Test.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Sachin Tendulkar completing 20 years in international cricket         
	It cant get better than this. Playing Test cricket after a really long time and Sachin completing 20 years. The passion and the way he has played, conducted himself on and off the field is exemplary. He has been a role model for the past 20 years. Its really amazing. I am honoured to share the dressing room with him. Not even in my dreams did I think that I would be playing with him, so it is an honour for me. I hope he gets a century here. That will be the ultimate.         
	The build-up to the Test         
	Its been nice. We are playing good cricket. We are playing Test cricket after a long time, so it will be good. We need to shift attention weve played a lot in the shorter format. After New Zealand, we are playing a Test for the first time, so we have to plan a bit differently. Hopefully, we will see some nice crowd coming in and supporting us.         
	Getting back to the Test mode         
	There are quite a few players who have been playing one-day Internationals for quite some time now. The guys who are only part of the Test side have played County cricket and Ranji Trophy matches. Apart from having an impact on a few batsmen, I dont think it will be a major factor.         
	The return of Zaheer Khan and his light workout at nets         
	Its a general way of preparation. Usually on the eve of the Test, he has a light workout... Prefers spending time at the gym.         
	The pace bowling combination         
	We will be thinking about that... All the seamers are bowling very well right now. We will see whatever suits us the best. When it comes to pace, all the three fast bowlers in the side bowl around the same speed. I dont think speed will be a major factor.         
	If choosing the spin combination will be tough         
	It is important to see what form a bowler is in. The think tank will sit and decide who is best suited for the conditions and have a look at a bit of stats, to see which particular bowler has been successful against them. It will be a factor because all the three spinners are quality bowlers.         
	Message for the Sri Lankans         
	I dont have any message for them. I have enough things to think about as far as my team is concerned. I am quite happy with the bowlers and the amount of cricket they have played, domestic cricket, county cricket all included. Even Zaheer has recovered fully and has bowled in two Ranji games. I am not worried too much about the bowling. That doesnt mean I am worried about the batting. I am quite happy with the bowlers. Amit Mishra is one of the bowlers who hasnt got a chance for a long time in the one-dayers. Pragyan Ojha is back. We have got the potential to get the opposition out.         
	On whether he is wary of the Lankan spinners         
	It will be interesting to see how their spinners bowl. Murali has got the experience of bowling in India. At the same time, bowling in India means using the SG ball. It has been said it assists the spinners a bit more. It will be interesting to see how their other spinners bowl with that ball. Reverse swing is also a factor.         
	Comparing this wicket with the one against South Africa, the last time a Test was held here         
	It looks very different, thats for sure. Thats what we are predicting and hoping for. Its not really the same wicket.         
	If memories of that last Test here still haunts         
	Not really It was long time back, and we have played enough cricket in between, be it Test cricket or one-day cricket. We didnt play well in the first session and we lost the game. But I dont think we have got any bad memories of that. We are not worried about what happened in the last match we played here.         
	The pressure         
	Indian team and pressure go hand in hand. I have not played a series where it was said that we were not under pressure. Thats nothing new. When you play in the best side in the world, you are under pressure. When we play the lowest ranked side, then too, we are under pressure. We are always under pressure, whatever the opposition. So we are not bothered too much about that. We will try to play to our potential.         
	The Monday start to the Test         
	Never really thought about it. For us, it is a Test match and it is important to start well. You never really think about such things. But of course, it is better off if you start with a Saturday and Sunday or if it ends on a Sunday.

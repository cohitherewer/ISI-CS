                                                        Fifa, Uefa reject   Wada rule  Copenhagen: The two most powerful bodies in football have rejected the World Anti-Doping Agency rsquo;s (Wada) out-of-competition drug-testing rule and asked the organisation to reconsider.  The Wada rule requires athletes in all sports to give drug-testers three months rsquo; notice of their whereabouts for one hour each day of the year. Fifa and Uefa say there are ldquo;fundamental differences rdquo; between an individual athlete training alone and one who spends six days a week at a stadium and is ldquo;thus easy to locate. rdquo;  Uefa team  Copenhagen: Uefa has created a team of legal and financial experts to police the finances of Europe rsquo;s top clubs. Clubs cannot play in the elite Champions League and second-tier Uefa Cup, which is renamed the Europa League next season, unless they have a financial license approved by the governing body.  Threat to sue  Manchester: Brazil striker Robinho threatened Pele with legal action Tuesday over the former great rsquo;s suggestion that the Manchester City star had a drug problem. Robinho is angry at Pele rsquo;s comments last week that he and Ronaldo had both had a drug problem.   Gibbs case  Durban: Herschelle Gibbs was Tuesday asked to put in 100 hours of community service as part of an agreement with the state to let him off the hook on a drunk driving charge.  Gibbs was to have appeared in the Cape Town magistrates rsquo; court Tuesday but the charges were withdrawn after an agreement with the national prosecuting authority.  Andrew cleared  Melbourne: Queensland Cricket has given a clean chit to Andrew Symonds on the Brisbane bar incident, saying the all-rounder did nothing that was unacceptable. 
  Media reports had alleged that Symonds was asked to leave the bar after he had accidentally broken a glass.  Force India  Melbourne: Force India became the ninth ranked team with Germany rsquo;s Adrian Sutil and Italian Giancarlo Fisichella taking the numbers 18 and 19. Formula One newcomers Brawn GP were dropped to the bottom of the paddock pecking order in a revised championship entry list.  Drivers rsquo; fees  Melbourne: Formula One drivers will pay less for their racing licences next year after meeting the sport rsquo;s governing body to settle grievances before the first race of the season.  Glock threats  Berlin: Timo Glock was a victim of personal threats after Lewis Hamilton passed him in the closing stages of last year rsquo;s Brazilian Grand Prix to secure the F1 drivers rsquo; title, the German said on Tuesday.

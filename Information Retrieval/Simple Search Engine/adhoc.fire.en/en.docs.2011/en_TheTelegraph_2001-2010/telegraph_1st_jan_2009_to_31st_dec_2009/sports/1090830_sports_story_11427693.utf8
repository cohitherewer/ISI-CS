The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Somdev in US Open main draw
                                                     Somdev in US Open main draw
                  
	New York: Somdev Dev Varman Saturday qualified for the mens singles main draw of the US Open, defeating Polish Jerzy Janowicz 6-3, 6-2 at Flushing Meadows.         
	This is Somdevs maiden Grand Slam main draw.         
	After rain stopped play Friday when the 24-year-old was leading 6-3, 5-2; 15-15, against his 229-ranked Polish opponent, Somdev took only a matter of minutes Saturday to fulfil his long cherished dream.         
	Somdev broke Jerzy once and saved a breakpoint to clinch the first set.         
	Indias top singles player had got the better of USs Alex Bogomolov Jr and Danish Igor Sijsling in tough battles in the first and second round respectively. Somdev becomes the first Indian in seven years to figure in the singles event of a Grand Slam tournament. Prakash Amritraj was the last player when he played in US Open in 2002.         
	Somdev had failed in all three attempts before this year to book a berth in the singles competition of a Grand Slam.         
	Who the world No.161 meets next will depend on the luck of the draw. (Agencies)

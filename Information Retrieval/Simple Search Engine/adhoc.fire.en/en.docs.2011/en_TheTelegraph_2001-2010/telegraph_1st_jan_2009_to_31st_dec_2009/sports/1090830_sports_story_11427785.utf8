                                                   Craving for a winning start 
            FREE KICK - P.K.Banerjee          
	In my football career spanning over 50 years, I have participated in every big tournament in India, both as a player and a coach. Though I enjoyed taking part in all these meets, IFA Shield would always remain very close to my heart. During my childhood, I grew up hearing stories about how Mohun Bagan defeated British teams to win the IFA Shield in 1911 and dreamt of playing in the prestigious tournament.         
	This years IFA Shield, too, I am confident, would be a highly competitive one. The presence of eight I-League teams will also make the tournament interesting as it will be a perfect opportunity for the top teams to test their strength before the start of the I-League.         
	As usual, the focus will once again be on the two Calcutta giants - Mohun Bagan and East Bengal. Both have not done too well in the national circuit in the past few years and should be eager to retain their coveted positions. As the season opener, the IFA Shield should be the right tournament for them to plug the loopholes. The presence of a team from Senegal will also increase the competition.         
	On paper, East Bengal look a slightly better side than their arch rivals. Apart from Brazilian Edmilson, East Bengal have two other good foreigners in the Czech midfielder and the Lebanese defender. And if Bhaichung Bhutia manages to free himself to play for East Bengal, then the red and yellow brigade will be ahead of all others in the competition.         
	But then, there is no point undermining the strength of Mohun Bagan despite the absence of an injured Jose Ramirez Barreto. Mohun Bagan are also unlucky to lose the services of defender NS Manju, who suffered an injury in the Nehru Cup. Still, the likes Deepak Mondal, Brazilian Marcos Pereira and Nigerian Edeh Chidi, who are capable of carrying the team on their shoulders.         
	Other than the three I-League teams from Calcutta and Mohammedan Sporting, I am looking forward to watch teams like Pune FC and the Lajong FC. Both were formed only a few years ago but have worked hard to get promoted to the premier division of the I-League.         
	The main attraction of Pune FC would be their goalkeeper Subroto Paul. He had a rather forgettable last season with East Bengal and found no takers in the Calcutta maidan. Now that Pune coach Derek Pereira has kept faith on him, Paul should be eager to display his class on his original home ground.         
	After a fairly long time the IFA bosses have managed to give the century-old tournament a true all-India look. The decision of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to allow the national team players to play for their clubs has added glamour to the IFA Shield.         
	Recently Bob Houghton described Durand Cup, IFA Shield and Santosh Trophy as nonsensical and wanted them to be scrapped. He is certainly a good coach but doesnt seem to have the required flexibility.         
	He may not be around in India after a couple of years, but the IFA Shield, like the FA Cup in England, would continue to be a source of entertainment for football fans in Calcutta for many more years.

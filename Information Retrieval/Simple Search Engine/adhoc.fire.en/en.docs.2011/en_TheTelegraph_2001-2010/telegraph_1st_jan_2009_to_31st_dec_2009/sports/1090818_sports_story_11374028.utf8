                                                   BOB TO GO WITH SUNIL
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES                      
	New Delhi: National coach Bob Houghton has decided to keep striker Sunil Chetri in the final squad for the ONGC Nehru Cup to be announced on Tuesday.         
	The Dempo forward, who suffered an ankle injury during the I-League last season, looked a doubtful starter, but Houghton said Chetri will still be in the squad.         
	He will be in the squad that I will announce tomorrow (Tuesday), said the British coach, after the practice session on Tuesday. Houghton is hoping his ace goal scorer would be available for the later stages of the tournament.         
	On Monday, Houghton tried a 4-3-3 formation during training, with captain Bhaichung Bhutia, Sushil Singh and Chetri playing as forwards.         
	The opening encounter against Lebanon, the Indian coach said, would be extremely crucial.         
	Lebanon are always a tough team, though Im confident that we would beat them, said Houghton.         
	Apart from Chetri, defender Samir Naik is also nursing an injury and may not be available for the first match.         
	In that case, N.S. Manju and Surkumar Singh are likely to play in the two wing back positions with Anwar and Gourmangi Singh as central defenders.         
	In case Houghton persists with the 4-3-3 formation, Steven Dias, N.P. Pradeep and Climax Lawrence would play in the midfield.         
	Meanwhile, Syria coach Fajir Ibrahim feels India would be a formidable opponent despite the former being ranked 61 positions above India. Syria, the 2007 Nehru Gold Cup runners-up, are ranked 95th in the latest Fifa rankings.         
	We may be much higher than India in the Fifa rankings but they will be the team to beat for us. They are the hosts and defending champions, and with the crowd support they have the home advantage. So we cant say they dont have the chance to win again, Ibrahim said on Monday.         
	Syria have come with just 17 players, three less than the permissible 20 and at least half of them were there in 2007.         
	We have brought 17 players and I think these will do for the tournament. Three of our regular international players are injured and three have club commitments  two in Kuwait and one in Qatar, he informed.         
	This is the Syrian national squad and the best available except for the six, he added.         
	Like India, Ibrahim said his side were also preparing for the 2011 AFC Asian Cup in Qatar.         
	For us this tournament is also part of preparation for the 2011 Asian Cup. So we want to win this time, he said.         
	Syria are yet to qualify for the 2011 Asian Cup while India have already made it to the AFC elite event after winning the AFC Challenge Cup last year.

                                                   Knight Riders camp ends
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Rain marred the last day of the Kolkata Knight Riders fitness camp at the Eden as the franchise had to call off outdoor practice on Friday and sweated it out at the Cricket Association of Bengals indoor facilities instead.         
	Physio Andrew Leipus and trainer Adrian le Roux handed over fitness charts and CDs, which summarises the programme to be followed in the lead up to the third edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), to each of the players.         
	Sourav Ganguly, who played the mentors role for the past two days, made a brief visit to the camp on Friday.         
	Speaking on the induction of the Indian Cricket League players into the different IPL franchises, the former India captain said: We will definitely try and get some ICL players, but the other teams too will be aiming for them.         
	So it depends on the situation as to who we take... But of course, all the ICL players are on the radar.         
	Sourav was also hopeful that the Knights would be able to organise more such camps before the mega Twenty20 event, which starts on March 12 next year. We will try to organise these type of camps whenever the players are free.         
	Asked if the dates were finalised for the next camp, he said: Lets see Whenever theres a seven-day window available where we can assemble the players, we will try for a three or four-day camp.         
	However, according to a Knights official, a second camp may be held at the end of September or early October.         
	On the recent controversy which cropped up following Manoj Tiwary and Ranadeb Boses presence at the Knights camp, the southpaw said: They came to meet the physio (Leipus) regarding their injuries. We know that they are with other franchises and we cant have them.         
	But it happens everywhere Taking advice from the physio of another team is not uncommon.         
	Expressing satisfaction over the overall outcome of the camp, Sourav said that it was too early to single out anyone from the bunch of the youngsters.         
	The basic idea was to have a look at everyone before the season starts.         
	We tried to see everyone and assess their fitness levels. They will now have to implement the planned programme. But overall, it has been a very good camp, he said.         
	He didnt want to make any specific comment on the World Anti-Doping Agencys row with the Indian players. The BCCI has also supported the players stand. Ive read about it in the newspapers but I dont want to comment on that. Its for the BCCI and the ICC to sort it out, he said.

                                                   Paul: My best yet to come
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                Subrata Paul.   A Telegraph picture    New Delhi: Life has come full circle for Subrata Paul, the goalkeeper who was once slammed for a footballers death. on the field         
	In 2005, the highly talented goalkeeper was summarily held responsible by the media and the football fraternity for the death of Brazilian striker Junior in the Federation Cup final in Bangalore. The youngster was exonerated but not before passing through a torrid time.         
	Paul had vowed to make a comeback and he has done so with a vengeance. For two years, he has been undoubtedly the best Indian keeper and his performance on Monday definitely puts him on the list of the countrys all-time greats.         
	To say this was my best match ever will not be right, a calm Paul said after the match. Perhaps I am yet to play my most memorable match, he said.         
	Paul, however, admitted that he had never pulled off three penalty saves in one match. Forget about international matches, in domestic matches also Ive never saved more than two spot kicks. May be at the district level.         
	Paul said he thought of his coach and former India goalkeeper Debasis Mukherjee immediately after the victory. Only yesterday (Sunday), Debasis sir offered some valuable tips on penalty shoot outs. It was of great help today.         
	I am also thankful to (coach) Bob Houghton, Paul said in the same breath. He kept faith in me. Thats important.         
	Paul was definitely referring to the humiliation he suffered in the hands of his old club, East Bengal last season. He was dismissed as no good by the Calcutta club after a below-par performance in a few matches. But Houghton maintained that Paul was the best in the country and said he would continue to be his first choice keeper.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hamiltons night out 
                                                     Hamiltons night out 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Lewis Hamilton on the podium in Singapore on Sunday. (AFP)                           
	Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton led from start to finish to win the Singapore Grand Prix as Jenson Button came in fifth to increase his championship lead. The victory brought McLaren driver Hamilton his 11th Grand Prix triumph but his compatriot Button will be equally delighted by finishing one place ahead of team-mate and championship rival Rubens Barichello.         
	Toyotas Timo Glock secured a career-best second while last years winner in Singapore, Fernando Alonso, took third in his Renault.         
	Meanwhile, Force Indias Vitantonio Liuzzi finished 14th, while Adrian Sutil retired after lap 38.         
	With three races remaining Button improved his championship lead over the Brazilian to 15 points. But it was a night of misfortune for Red Bull as Australian Mark Webber failed to finish, while Sebastian Vettel, a further 10 points behind Barichello in the title race, finished fourth after his race was ruined by a pit lane speeding penalty.         
	Hamilton made a fine start to maintain his pole position place at the front of the grid after the first lap.         
	But behind the 24-year-old, Williams Nico Rosberg moved ahead of Vettel to take second. BMW Saubers Nick Heidfeld started in the pit-lane having been relegated to the back of the grid because his car was found to be underweight after qualifying.         
	His removal from the fourth row meant all behind him moved up one place and consequently Button started in 11th. And the 29 year-old climbed one place after the first lap into 10th when he overtook the Williams of Kazuki Nakajima.         
	Buttons team-mate Barrichello moved up through the field to seventh. Hamilton, meanwhile, was building a healthy lead at the front and by the end of the fourth lap he was 1.9 seconds ahead of Rosberg.         
	There was disappointment for Renaults Romain Grosjean, however, as he was forced to return to the pits due to a problem with his brakes, ending his race.         
	Webber had started fourth on the grid but had dropped to sixth by lap nine with both Alonso and Glock moving ahead of the Australian.         
	Hamilton continued to increase his lead at the front in his McLaren as he again set the fastest lap to move 2.2 seconds ahead of Rosberg by lap 10.         
	There was an intriguing battle towards the back of the grid between Ferraris Giancarlo Fisichella and Tonio Liuzzi. Liuzzi produced a fine passing manoeuvre on lap 14 to move ahead of the Italian into 16th but Fisichella swiftly went back inside his compatriot. The yellow flag was waved soon after when a piece of debris flew off the back of Glocks car just before turn eight while by lap 16 Hamiltons lead had increased further as he was 3.1 seconds ahead of Rosberg before the latter made his first pit stop three laps later.         
	But there was mistake from the German as he was too quick exiting the pits and bounced over the pit-exit line and was subsequently hit with a drive-through penalty.         
	Hamilton then entered the pit-lane on lap 20 and made a clean exit but the safety car was deployed on the following lap after Sutil and Heidfeld collided. Sutil spun on the kerb of turn 14 before pulling out straight into Heidfeld and the crash brought an end to both their races. Alonso, Heikki Kovalainen and Button took the opportunity to make their first pit stop and Button re-emerged in eighth place.         
	The safety car left the circuit at the end of lap 26 and racing resumed with Hamilton at front followed by Rosberg and Vettel. Rosberg took his drive-through penalty two laps later and returned to the circuit behind Jarno Trulli in 14th.

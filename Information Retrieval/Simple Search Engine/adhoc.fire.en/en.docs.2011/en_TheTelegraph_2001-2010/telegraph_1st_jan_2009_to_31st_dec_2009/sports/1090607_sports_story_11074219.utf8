	London: Jesse Ryder hit 31 as New Zealand began their World T20 Cup campaign by easing to a seven-wicket win over Scotland on Saturday in a match reduced to seven overs a side due to rain.         
	Ryder put on a 51-run partnership with stand-in captain Brendon McCullum in 19 balls to quickly chip into Scotlands score of 89 for four and exploit poor bowling. After losing two wickets, the Black Caps entered the sixth and penultimate over requiring 22. Two sixes from Ross Taylor and another from Scott Styris off medium-pacer Jan Stander completed the win with six balls to spare.         
	Ryan Watson got the Scots off to a flying start by hitting a spectacular 27 from only 10 deliveries once the match finally started 2 hours, 20 minutes late after heavy rain at the Oval disrupted the start of the second day of the tournament.         
	New Zealand did not begin to assert control until they introduced seamer Ian Butler in the third over. Butler struck with his first delivery to dismiss Watson, who was caught in the deep attempting to hit over cover.         
	Scotlands scoring rate remained strong with Watsons fellow opener Navdeep Poonia and Kyle Coetzer sharing a half-century stand in just 22 deliveries.Coetzer was given a reprieve when he was dropped on four by McCullum, the stand-in captain for Daniel Vettori, who is recovering from a shoulder injury.         
	He went on to hit 33 from 15 balls, including three fours and two sixes before edging Butler to wicketkeeper Peter McGlashan with just two balls of the innings remaining.         
	After Coetzer departed, Poonia was run out attempting to steal a single and Colin Smith was bowled by a full toss.         
	The final three balls of Scotlands innings resulted in wickets, preventing them adding to their score of 89.         
	New Zealands final group D match is on Tuesday against South Africa, which plays Scotland on Sunday.           (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Committee wants talent pool, Super League
                                                     Committee wants talent pool, Super League
            A STAFF REPORTER            Sourav Ganguly                           
	Calcutta: In the first meeting of the cricket development committee (CDC) of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) under Sourav Gangulys chairmanship, on Monday, the former India captain made some valuable suggestions.         
	Sourav reportedly said that CAB should select a pool of players from local cricket, and monitor them for at least three years.         
	These cricketers should practise together throughout the year for at least three years. The players would, of course, be playing for their clubs but would be monitored by the CAB to develop their game, particularly during the off-season.         
	The other committee members included Arun Lal, Pranab Roy and Ashok Malhotra, but Malhotra was not present. Lal is said to have suggested a Super League, which would make local cricket more competitive. Lal found Souravs support on this.         
	The committee also discussed the conditions of the grounds. Sourav said the Rangers, YMCA and Town grounds should get better matches of the league as they are in better condition.         
	Some of the other things, which came up for discussion, included age verification and harsher punishment for match fixing.         
	CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya told reporters that the first meeting had been useful.         
	The committee prepared a master plan for the improvement of the game at all levels in the state, he said. The committee would be responsible for assessment of the cricketers after the end of each season. They would be receiving a report from the selectors.         
	The committee was formed at the working committee meeting of the CAB in August.         
	However, the CDC would not take care of disciplinary issues. We will have a separate committee which will look into disciplinary issues, Dalmiya further added.         
	The next date for the CDC meeting has not yet been decided.

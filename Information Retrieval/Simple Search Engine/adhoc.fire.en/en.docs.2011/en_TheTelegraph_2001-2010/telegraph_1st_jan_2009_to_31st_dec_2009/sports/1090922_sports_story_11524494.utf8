The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Churchill, Bagan look up to foreign recruits
                                                     Churchill, Bagan look up to foreign recruits
            JAYDEEP BASU                Churchill Brothers Odafe Okolie and Jose Barreto of Mohun Bagan                             
	New Delhi: On Tuesday, when Mohun Bagan meet Churchill Brothers in the Durand Cup final, the foreigners of both the teams are likely to decide where the title goes.         
	Like any other Indian club, both Mohun Bagan and Churchill owe their recent successes to the foreign recruits. If the presence of the two Nigerians  Odafe Okolie and Ogba Kalu  was the key factor behind Churchills spectacular run in the last three seasons, then the Jose Barreto-Edeh Chidi combination should be credited for transforming Mohun Bagan in a span of just one week.         
	Looking at the Mohun Bagan team in the Durand Cup, it is hard to believe that they managed just two victories in four matches in the IFA Shield. The induction of Barreto and Chidi has resulted in a flood of goals, nine to be precise, in three matches. Seven of them have been scored by foreign duo.         
	Churchill, on the other hand, are slightly off colour because Odafe and Kalu are yet to hit the required form. Without the two, Churchill can hardly expect to repeat their IFA Shield performance as no other player in the team can carry the team on his shoulder.         
	Look at Dempos showing in the Durand Cup. Packed with national team players, they cut a sorry figure against Churchill because Ranty Martins and Beto were not in their elements. Ditto with East Bengal, who blamed it on poor foreign recruits for their miserable showings.         
	Only three weeks ago, the Indian footballers were on a high at the Ambedkar Stadium when they won the Nehru Cup. In Durand, the same boys were either tired or not good enough to deliver the goods for their respective clubs.         
	Nevertheless, Odafe has already sounded a war cry. I am happy that Mohun Bagan have got Barreto and Chidi, he said. Now both the players have two foreign players each. All of you will get to know the result at the end of the 90 minutes.         
	Odafe made it clear that he was not afraid of facing a rejuvenated Mohun Bagan. How many national team players Dempo had? Six? Seven? What was the result of the Churchill-Dempo match? You tell me which team is better ... Dempo or Mohun Bagan? he asked.         
	Whatever Odafe has to say, going by the current form, Mohun Bagan hold a slight edge because Karim Bencherifa has done a wonderful job in tightening his defence and the midfield. Yet, the presence of Odafe on the other side can make things difficult for them.         
	To say Odafe stands between Mohun Bagan and their 17th title wont be an exaggeration. The Nigerian has scored more than 150 goals in the last three seasons that surely makes him the biggest threat to any defence in the country.         
	At the same time, there is no reason to undermine the class and quality of Barreto. Churchill have a young and energetic defence but they have to really stretch themselves to contain the scheming Brazilian. To Mohun Bagans delight, Barreto has already talked about winning the Durand as a warm up to the I-League.         
	Why talk about me only? I dont play the game alone, said a modest Barreto. Everyone has played a role behind reaching the final.         
	Initially, I wasnt too enthusiastic about Durand. But now that we have reached the final, I am determined not to return to Calcutta without the trophy. The Durand Cup should be ours this time, said the Brazilian.         
	Knowing Barreto, one is sure he would do everything to keep his words.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wild card Cilic up
                                                                                                                                   Wild card Cilic up
                      
	Basel: Fourth-seeded Marin Cilic won his first round match at the Swiss Indoors on Wednesday, beating Philipp Petzschner of Germany 6-4, 6-4.         
	The 21-year-old Croat broke Petzschners serve in the fifth game of each set.         
	Cilic, a wild-card entry in Basel, can still make a run at qualifying for the ATP Tour finals in London this month.         
	He likely needs to win the Swiss Indoors and advance several rounds at the Paris Masters next week.         
	Cilic is currently 12th in the points race with only the top eight qualifying for London. He had won the Chennai Open earlier this year.           (AP)

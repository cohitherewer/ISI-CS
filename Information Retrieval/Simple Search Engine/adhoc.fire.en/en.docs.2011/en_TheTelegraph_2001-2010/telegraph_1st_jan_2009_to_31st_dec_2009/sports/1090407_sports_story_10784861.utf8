The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I believe in one captain, says Glenn McGrath
                                                     I believe in one captain, says Glenn McGrath
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Glenn McGrath in New Delhi on Monday                           
	New Delhi: Former Australian pacer Glenn McGrath Monday joined the debate on John Buchanans multiple captains theory saying there should be only one captain on the field.         
	The legendary fast bowler, who will play for the Delhi DareDevils in the Indian Premier League (IPL)s second edition, said he was not impressed by Buchanans idea.         
	I have played under Buchanan for a long time, said McGrath. He was the coach of the Australian national team andhad many such theories. Sometimes he said these to test the players and even to test the media. He just wanted to see how far they could go, the Aussie bowler commented.         
	Perhaps this was one of his many ideas. As far as I am concerned, I believe in one captain, McGrath said.         
	The DareDevils star, however, felt that Buchanan was not seriously going to appoint more than one official captain.         
	I think all he wanted was to have some advisors for the captain on the field. But that is nothing unusual. A good captain never takes his decisions alone. He always discusses with the senior players on the field. Thats a regular practice in the game of cricket, said McGrath.         
	On his own fitness, McGrath said he was fit and his competitive edge was still intact.         
	The last few months were very tough indeed. But then I had to do something. The IPL is something very special to me.         
	I struggled a bit last year but that was more about (wife) Jane and how the situation was back home, McGrath said. That wont be a concern this time. Mum may bring the kids over for the middle period, depending on the schedule. My whole focus will be a lot different, which I think will all be positive.         
	As a fast bowler, McGrath said he was looking forward to playing in South Africa. The pitches in South Africa should be quick with a lot more bounce. I am sure the youngsters in the team should be able to adjust to the situation.         
	Asked to comment on Virender Sehwag, McGrath said the Indian opener was a devastating batsman. I have always enjoyed bowling to Sehwag. He is a very destructive batsman and takes the game away.         
	As a skipper also I rate him highly, I have played under him and I hope this time we will help him to win the cup.The lanky McGrath also threw his weight behind Brett Lee.         
	Brett is very experienced and a class bowler and he has put a lot of hard work in this last few months and has grown much stronger, he said.

	Dubai: Novak Djokovics bid to close in on Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer in the absence of the top two this week began with symptoms of the stresses of the modern game.         
	The top-seed former Australian Open champion was self-admittedly not impressed with his own performance as he struggled with Flavio Cipolla, an Italian qualifier who has yet to break the top 100.         
	Djokovic broke early but could not get away from a tenacious opponent, who covered the court superbly and mixed slices with topspins cunningly on the backhand and even sometimes on the forehand too.         
	Djokovic could not add to his break and took a long time trying to close out the set. He also needed a monster game before he could consolidate his early break in the second set.         
	Andy Murray has a difficult half here, with a second round against one Frenchman, Arnaud Clement, who has won both their previous meetings, and a possible quarter final against a second, Richard Gasquet.         
	Clement came back well to overcome Rainer Schuttler by 1-6, 6-3, 6-3.         
	Gasquet won 6-3, 5-7, 6-3 against Marat Safin. Another Frenchman to reach the second round was Gilles Simon who is trying to take the challenge to the worlds top four.         
	Earlier, third seeds Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy made a shock first round exit from tournament after losing 4-6, 6-2, 8-10 to the unseeded pair of Simone Bolelli and Ivo Karlovic, as reported in Tuesdays Late City edition.         
	Mahesh Bhupathi and Prakash Amritraj are also in the fray with their respective partners. Bhupathi and Mark Knowles of Bahama will play their opener against UAEs Hamoud Abbas and Mahmoud-Naden Al Baloushi.         
	Amritraj and his Pakistani partner Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi have been given a wild card entry and they will begin their campaign against Czech Martin Damm and Robert Lindstedt of Sweden.

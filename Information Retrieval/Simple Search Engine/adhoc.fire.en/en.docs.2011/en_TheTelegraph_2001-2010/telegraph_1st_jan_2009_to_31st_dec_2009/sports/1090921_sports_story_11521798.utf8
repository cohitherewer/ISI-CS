	Mumbai: After leading India into the Davis Cup world Group for the first time in 11 years, Somdev Dev Varman said he believed that he was finally settling down in the role of the leading singles player.         
	I hope so, but it was a team effort and one should not forget the contribution that Rohan (Bopanna) and the entire staff have made, Dev Varman told The Telegraph from Johannesburg on Sunday.         
	The last time India played in the elite group of mens team tennis was in 1998, when Dev Varman was still learning the basics of the game.         
	Its a great feeling. I am happy for my team, particularly the older guys who were playing in the World Group before, and also the entire nation, Dev Varman said.         
	The 24-year-old Assam-born said that winning the third set tie-break was the turning point of the match.         
	I was not going to lose today come what may. But I couldnt have done it without my team. They really got behind me and never let me drop my head. I cant thank the team enough for the way they lifted me today, he said.         
	The two-time NCAA singles champion admitted that Indias loss in Saturdays doubles meant a lot depended on his match against Rik de Voest.         
	There was pressure to win but I was focussing on executing my game plan. I must give credit to Rik (de Voest) for the way he played. He really took the fight to me, he said.         
	Dev Varman and De Voest trained under the same coach Scott McCain earlier this year, but the former said that had little influence on the outcome of the match. It was the same for both of us, he said.         
	Indias non-playing captain S.P. Misra was also happy that under his captaincy, the team qualified for the World Group, and heaped lavish praise on Somdev for his effort.         
	I am a relieved man today. After being 0-2 down, it was difficult way to stage a comeback, but I had faith in Somdev. Because once he gets started, he climbs up. He gave us whatever we wanted. He is a brilliant player.         
	Its a great achievement for us. After 11 years, we are into the World Group, and I am the captain, he said.         
	As the fifth rubber became inconsequential, Misra handed Yuki Bhambri his debut in the Davis Cup. He was all praise for the 17-year-old, who is the world No.1 in junior tennis.         
	Misra said he has high hopes from Yuki.         
	Our future is very bright. Yukis got a great future, he is just 17 and he will be around for a long time. He and Somdev will make a great team for India in the Davis Cup, Misra signed off.         
	India went into this crucial playoff tie without Leander Paes, their maninstay for over a decade. Mahesh Bhupathis injury forced India to concede the doubles tie on Saturday.

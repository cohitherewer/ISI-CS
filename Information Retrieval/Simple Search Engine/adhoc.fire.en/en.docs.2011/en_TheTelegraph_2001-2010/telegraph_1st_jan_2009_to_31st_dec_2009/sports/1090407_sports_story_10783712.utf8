The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No place for Strauss
                                                   No place for Strauss
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Test and one-day captain Andrew Strauss was left out of Englands preliminary 30-man squad for the Twenty20 World Cup in June, which was announced at Lords on Monday.         
	England will host the tournament from June 5-21.         
	The selectors will name the England Twenty20 captain once a comprehensive review of the recently concluded West Indies tour has taken place.         
	According to an ECB release, the squad, which will be halved to 15 players on May 1, contains five players who are yet to be capped at international level.         
	England national selector Geoff Miller said in a statement: Andrew Strauss had an outstanding tour of the West Indies during a difficult winter. Andrew and the selectors believe his game is better suited to Test and ODI cricket and it is for that reason he has not been selected in the squad.         
	Also in are spinner Shaun Udal, who turned 40 last month, and all-rounder Samit Patel, who was left out of the Twenty20 and one-day matches in the West Indies after failing to reach acceptable standards of fitness.         
	Meanwhile, South Africa also named its provisional 30-man squad. The squad will be reduced to a final group of 15 next month.         
	England probables

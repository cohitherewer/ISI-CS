The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fletcher open to ECB offer
                                                   Fletcher open to ECB offer
            Steve James                      
	Former England coach Duncan Fletcher would consider a dramatic return to the job in the wake of Peter Mooress sacking last week. One understands that Fletcher, currently on part-time consultancy deals with both South Africa and Hampshire, would listen to an offer were the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to approach him.         
	But Fletcher will need to be approached. It is thought he will not be applying for the post when it is advertised.         
	Fletcher spent 20 days in Australia recently with the victorious South Africa team, leaving after the first-Test success in Perth with ringing endorsements of his work from players and coaching staff alike. He is due to spend another 30 days with the team this year.         
	From his Cape Town home, Fletcher, who resigned from the England job in April 2007, has watched the crisis in English cricket unfold with a mixture of sadness and disbelief. A return is highly unlikely given his controversial autobiography, in which he criticised Andrew Flintoff and the ECB in general.         
	But given the extraordinary events of the past week, anything is possible. The ECB are beginning their search for the best coach in the world and there are many, including some in the England dressing-room, who believe that man is Fletcher.         
	Meanwhile, Darren Lehmann has put his hand up for the role. The retired South Australia batsman said: Yes, Im interested. Its something I would definitely consider. Shane Warne has recommended Lehmann for the job.           THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

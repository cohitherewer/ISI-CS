                                                   AIFF defers decision 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: A final decision on the Goal 2011 project will be taken later this month, according to the All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources.         
	The senior officials of the AIFF on Friday met the representatives of the clubs and sought their opinion on the project.         
	While some clubs felt that the federation should start the ambitious project from July 2009, others preferred to begin it from July 2010.         
	As per the Goal 2011 plan, 25 to 30 top players will be selected for the camp under chief coach Bob Houghton and will be kept reserved for the exclusive use of the national team till the Asia Cup in January 2011.         
	Top AIFF functionaries will meet the acting president Praful Patel to apprise him of the situation. The project will start from 2009 only if the federation manages to rope in some sponsors, said a source.         
	Dempo coach Armando Colaco opposed the entire idea and said camps should be held for shorter durations.         
	 My team will be a depleted side and will find it difficult to play in the AFC Cup if the federation decides to take five of my footballers for such a long time, said the Dempo coach.         
	Some other clubs, including East Bengal, wanted the quota of foreigners to be increased in case the federation decided to reserve 25 to 30 players for the national team.         
	While Sporting Clube de Goa feared that the entire project could prove to be a colossal waste of money, Henry Menezes, a member of the technical committee stressed on youth development.         
	Houghton, later, said he was happy that the plan could receive support from the clubs.         
	The Nehru Cup football tournament, which India won last year, will be held from August 19 to 31, national coach Bob Houghton said on Friday. Although the venue of the tournament is yet to be decided, Delhis Ambedkar Stadium is the frontrunner.

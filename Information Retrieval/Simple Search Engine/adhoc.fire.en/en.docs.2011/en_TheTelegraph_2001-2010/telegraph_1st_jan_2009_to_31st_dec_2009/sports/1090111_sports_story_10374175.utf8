The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brad Hodge spits fire
                                                     Brad Hodge spits fire
                  Hodge                     
	Melbourne: Australian batsman Brad Hodge took the national selectors head on with his caustic comments after being ignored for the one-day and Twenty20 ties against South Africa.         
	The 34-year-old Hodge questioned the selectors logic, claiming players with lesser records had been favoured over him. The idea to be selected for Australia is to score runs, isnt it? And thats what Ive done. Maybe they might change it and score less runs and I might get selected, said Hodge sarcastically.         
	Hodge, who last played for Australia during their West Indies tour, has scored 264 runs at an average of 52.8 in six Ford Ranger Cup matches this season and is the leading scorer in the Twenty20 Big Bash with an average of 65 from four games.         
	In contrast, 25-year-old Shaun Marsh, who has secured berths in both the squads, has averaged 25.16 in the one-day tournament and has scored 68 runs in his past four Twenty20 matches.         
	I think if you look at the criteria, there are some guys in that side who mightnt have done as well as I have. Unfortunately, thats the way it is, he was quoted as saying by a local newspaper.         
	As I say, the criteria is to score runs, and Ive done that heavily for a number of years. Unfortunately, it doesnt seem to be working for me. Maybe Ill play for Australia in lawn bowls in the future, maybe tennis, maybe rowing. Im not sure yet, he said.         
	Hodge felt he was no longer wanted in the national set-up.         
	Ive no idea (if Ill play for Australia again). I dont know and I dont think so. The disappointing thing about is that I played well in the Test match in the West Indies (when) Australia was under pressure. My performances for Australia have always been pretty good and my credentials are there but unfortunately a knock on the doors not coming my way.         
	Hodge also revealed that he spoke to Merv Hughes on Thursday and said it was his first conversation with a national selector in a long time, but did not reveal the details of the discussion.         
	I dont think it matters whether you are 20, 30 or 40, if you are getting the runs Im sure anyone can be considered if youre up to it, Hughes said. I dont think age will come into it if youre scoring runs and doing your job. If an opportunity arises anywhere, you wouldnt knock it back.

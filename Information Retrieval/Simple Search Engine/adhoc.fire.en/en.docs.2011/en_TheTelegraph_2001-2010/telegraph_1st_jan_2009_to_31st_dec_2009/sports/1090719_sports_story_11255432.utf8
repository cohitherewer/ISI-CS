                                                   Stage 14 marred by death
                      
	Besancon (France): The Tour de France was marred by the death of a spectator on Saturday as Russian Serguei Ivanov won the 14th stage, a 199-km ride from Colmar.         
	A woman was hit by a motorcycle involved with the race when she crossed the road near the town of Wittelsheim, 38.5 km into the stage, and died almost instantly, according to a gendarmerie officer.         
	Two other people were injured when they were hit by the motorcycle but their lives were not in danger, officials said. It was the first fatal accident on the Tour since a child died in 2002 after being hit by a car from the publicity caravan.         
	The accident happened shortly after a 12-man breakaway, featuring American George Hincapie, went past the crowd.         
	Spains Oscar Freire and Julian Dean of New Zealand started the stage after they were shot and slightly injured during Fridays ride. Police investigating the incident said they were hunting two teenagers. The group built up an advantage of eight minutes 40 seconds as the Astana team set up a leisurely pace in front of the pack.         
	The AG2r-La Mondiale team, defending Italys Rinaldo Nocentinis yellow jersey, started to work some 50 km from the finish and were able to keep him in the overall lead. I want to thank my team mates, Nocentini, who has been in yellow for eight days, told reporters. They have been doing great work.         
	Nocentini now leads Hincapie by five seconds with Spains Alberto Contador in third place, also six seconds off the pace.         
	Seven-times champion Lance Armstrong slipped to fourth, eight seconds adrift of Nocentini, but the positions are expected to be upset by Sundays first Alpine stage to the Swiss ski resort of Verbier.         
	Ivanov attacked the breakaway group with just over 10 km remaining and never looked back, beating Irelands Nicolas Roche and New Zealands Hayden Roulston, by 16 seconds.         
	I waited for the right moment (to attack). I surprised some riders and at that point I just gave everything I had, Ivanov said. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania up, Bopanna bows out
                                                   Sania up, Bopanna bows out
                      
	Paris: Sania Mirza with Chia-Jung Chuang, her partener from Chinese Taipei, managed to win the first round in the womens doubles event of the French Open. The 14th seeds beat the Turk-Belgian pair of Ipek Senoglu and Yanina Wickmayer 7-5, 6-1.         
	Sania had crashed out of the singles event on Tuesday, losing to Kazakhistans Galina Voskoboeva in straight sets.         
	The Indo-Chinese Taipei pair will now meet Polands Radwanska sisters in the second round.         
	Meanwhile, Rohan Bopanna and Jonathan Erlich crashed out of the mens doubles event after suffering a 4-6, 6-7 (10-12) defeat at the hands of Guillermo Garcia Lopez and Sergio Roitman.         
	After conceding the first set, the Indo-Israeli duo had a good chance to draw level as they were leading 4-1 at one stage but allowed the Spanish-Argentine pair to claw their way back into the set.         
	Guillermo and Sergio stretched the second set to a tie-breaker and converted their third match point to seal the fate of Bopanna and Erlich. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Somdev enters quarters
                                                   Somdev enters quarters
                      
	New Delhi: Somdev Dev Varman registered a brilliant come-from-behind win over Pavol Cervenak to storm into the quarter finals of the $125,000 ATP Challenger in Seoul, but it was all over for Prakash Amritraj.         
	The fourth-seeded Somdev came back from a set down to beat the Slovak 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the second round of the hard court event.         
	Prakash, however, went down 1-6, 3-6 to second seed and Taipei Davis Cupper Yen-Hsun Lu.         
	Somdev, who is out of the doubles event after losing in the first round, next faces Czech Republics Dusan Lojda.         
	Prakashs challenge is over in doubles as well, as he and partner Marin ko Matosevic lost the opening round 4-6, 4-6 against the top-seeded Thai pair of Sanchai and Sonchat Ratiwatana.         
	Also biting the dust was Purav Raja, who along with Australian partner Sadik Kadir, lost his first round match 7-5, 2-6, 8-10 to the Japanese pair of Hiroki Kondo and Go Soeda.

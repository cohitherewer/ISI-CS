	Calcutta: Poor refereeing cost Subrata Bhattacharyas Chirag United a win as the men in purple had to settle for a goalless draw against Camellia George Telegraph in a CFL Premier Division match at the Barasat Stadium Tuesday.         
	Chirag, who had won their first three matches, had to start with Parveen Kumar and under-19 Soumik Chakraborty upfront as Brazilian Joshimar was out with a double booking. And Parveen almost made the day for Chirag in the 17th minute.         
	After the George goalkeeper Swarup Das had parried a Hardip Singh shot, Parveen executed a back-volley off the rebound. With the keeper beaten, the ball had just appeared to cross the goalline when a George defender cleared it. Though the Chirag players claimed the goal, referee Kashinath Sen refused to budge disallowing the goal.         
	The rest of the match was all about Chirag pressing men forward in search of that elusive goal and George crowding the defence to unsettle the opposition. Soumik had an impressive game with sudden bursts and decent ball control. At the half-hour mark, his shot had beaten the keeper only to find the vertical on its way.

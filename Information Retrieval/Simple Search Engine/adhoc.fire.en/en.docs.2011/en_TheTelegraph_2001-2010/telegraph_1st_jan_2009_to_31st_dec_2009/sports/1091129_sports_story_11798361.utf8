The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kuruppu: Murali form part and parcel of the game 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kuruppu: Murali form part and parcel of the game 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: One is a superstar, the other a star in the making. The first is in India for most probably his last full-fledged series, and the second on his maiden visit. For Muttiah Muralidharan and Angelo Mathews, apart from their bowling styles, the difference ends there.         
	For both the players, the current tour of India has been a leveller. So far, at least.         
	Murali has not been able to make an impact on the Indian batsmen whereas Mathews has failed to match the high standards his captain Kumar Sangakkara had spoken of at the start of the series.         
	Murali is a legend. He has been around for many years and has consistently bowled well.         
	That he has not been able to take enough wickets in this series is part and parcel of the game, Brendon Kuruppu, former Sri Lankan Test batsman and present team manager, said on arrival from Kanpur on Saturday.         
	Fast-bowling all-rounder Mathews was touted by Sangakkara as the X-factor in his team, lending the team flexibility and balance.         
	Three weeks into the series, the 22-year-old would be eager to swap his batting averages (15.00) with that of his bowling (128.00).         
	Mathews is still learning the game. He got a rough decision in Ahmedabad and did not score in the two innings (in Kanpur) after that. I dont see any issue there, Kuruppu said.         
	I dont think he has struggled with his bowling either. He is doing well.         
	Hopefully, the Brabourne track, venue for the third and final Test starting on Wednesday, with its sporting nature, would help them.

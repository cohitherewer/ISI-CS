The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chelsea ease past Arsenal
                                                   Chelsea ease past Arsenal
                      
	London: Chelsea clinched an automatic spot in next seasons Champions League on Sunday with a 4-1 win at an Arsenal side that still look ill-equipped to challenge for the Premier League.         
	Alex and Nicolas Anelka scored first-half goals at the Emirates Stadium before an own goal by Kolo Toure and a late strike by Florent Malouda sealed Arsenals first loss in 22 Premier League matches.         
	The Gunners had been the only team that could have overtaken Chelsea for third place but failed to turn their long periods of possession into goals and are now certain to finish fourth  forcing them to play an early season qualifying match to get into the Champions League.         
	Chelsea moved to 77 points with two games remaining. Although that is nine ahead of Arsenal, Chelsea have just about no chance of catching leaders Manchester United and are almost as unlikely to overtake second-place Liverpool  who are three points ahead and have a better goal difference.         
	Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger had already acknowledged his desire to bolster his young side with experienced players during the offseason and the need looked even more urgent after the Gunners struggled to hurt Chelsea with their intricate passing.         
	Arsenal had dominated possession and missed a cluster of half-chances when Alex put Chelsea in front in the 28th minute. Didier Drogba floated in a free kick that he had won out on the right and the Brazil defender jumped highest to head the ball in off the bar from about 12 metres.         
	The Gunners defensive frailty was exposed again 11 minutes later when Anelka spun away from a challenge near halfway and ran with the ball to the edge of the area. With Silvestre failing to close him down, Anelka unleashed a shot that bent away from goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski and went just inside the post.         
	Any hopes of a comeback were ended four minutes after halftime when Toure redirected a cross by former Arsenal fullback Ashley Cole, whose every touch was loudly jeered by the home fans, past his own goalkeeper at the near post to make the score 3-0.         
	Although Nicklas Bendtner got a goal back, Malouda completed the scoring in the 86th with a close-range finish.

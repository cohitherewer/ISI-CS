    - Ghanaian forward nets a brace as East Bengal defeat JCT 2-1           A STAFF REPORTER                                              Yusif Yakubu kisses the turf after scoring the first goal in East Bengal rsquo;s I-League match against JCT at the Barasat Stadium on Friday.

	Calcutta: They say age is just a number. And the 34-year-old Yusif Yakubu is living up to that maxim day in and day out.         
	Friday was no different. East Bengals Ghanaian striker netted a brace (35th and 68th) as the red-and-gold brigade defeated JCT 2-1 in an I-League match at the Barasat Stadium on Friday. JCTs Brazilian striker Eduardo da Silva, who came in as a substitute for an injured Paul MacJames just before half-time, reduced the margin in the 75th minute. But it was too little, too late for Sukhwinder Singhs boys.         
	When East Bengal roped in Yakubu, before the I-League in September last year, Doubting Thomases questioned the rationale behind choosing an ageing striker. But as the season wore on and the red-and-gold brigades campaign went from bad to worse, it was Yakubu who was the only silver lining.         
	Playing behind the striker  it was generally Sunil Chetri, but on Friday Syed Rahim Nabi was on deputation for the injured India player  Yakubu had always been in a class of his own.         
	 Whether taking out his marker from the opponents defensive third to create that extra space for the teammates or laying it off for his striking partners with delightful touches, Yakubu has simply been outstanding this season. No wonder his coach Subhas Bhowmick gushes every time Yakubus name crops up: Wish I got him six or seven years back. It would have been a dream. Well, next season too, Bhowmick will be getting Yakubu with him, and hopefully the fans will be treated with more magic.         
	Like, say, Fridays first goal. The Ghanaian striker subtly chested down Rennedy Singhs cross which left his marker Anwar beaten hands down.         
	He then unleashed a fierce 22-yard drive, which went past JCT goalkeeper Karanjit Singh like a bullet. A goal worth going miles to see and even the JCT bench was seen nodding in approval.         
	East Bengals second goal was a culmination of a delightful build-up; something every coach should be proud of.         
	Ismael Addo weaved his way through the JCT midfield and played it to Alvito DCunha. Alvitos return pass found both Addo and Yakubu inside the box. Addo allowed his countrymate to get himself under the light for the second time, and Yakubu obliged with a smart finish. Two-nil, too good.         
	And JCT suddenly woke up from their slumber. Eduardo and Amadeep Singh started showing more urgency in building up moves and their persistent effort paid off.         
	Amandeeps centre found the Brazilian inside the six-yard box and East Bengal goalkeeper Abhra Mondal hardly managed to parry his stab. Off the rebound, Eduardo, who will be joining Churchill next season, made no mistake.         
	The hosts could have added one more, but Alvito  who was freed on the left by one of Yakubus trademark through balls  could not find the target with only Karanjit to beat.         
	East Bengal now have 27 points from 21 matches and all those fears about relegation has been put to rest. Theoretically JCT, 22 points from 21 matches, are still in the danger zone.         
	They need to win their last match against Mumbai FC in Ludhiana; a draw or loss can also see them stay in the premier division provided Chruchill Brothers defeat Mohammedan Sporting in Goa, thanks to the better goal difference.         
	On current form, Churchill losing to Mohammedan Sporting doesnt look a likely result, so it wont be preposterous to say that Sukhwinder Singhs men will be there in the next edition.

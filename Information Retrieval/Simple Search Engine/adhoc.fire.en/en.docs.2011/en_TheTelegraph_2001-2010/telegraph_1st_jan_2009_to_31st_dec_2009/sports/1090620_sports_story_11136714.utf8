The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cup is everything to us: Younis
                                                   Cup is everything to us: Younis
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nottingham: Pakistan captain Younis Khan spoke to the media after their seven-run victory over South Africa in the semi-final of the World Twenty20 on Thursday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	How important is this World Cup for Pakistan?         
	Actually, this World Cup is everything to us, especially under the conditions we are in back home. The security situation is not good and theres lot of fighting going on. If we win this World Cup, it would change a lot of things in our country, especially in the north, the region I come from.         
	What does it take to be a T20 super power?         
	Twenty20 is nothing special. You just need some match-winners, like we have Shahid Afridi, Kamran Akmal, Umar Gul and Misbah-ul Haq. All you need is to get the combination right and do the right things at the right time. Luckily for me, everything is falling in place. If you look at it, theres no Australia, South Africa or India left in the tournament and South Africa hadnt lost a game till they met us. They couldnt deliver on a particular day while we did.         
	Was Misbah demoted in the batting order because of fitness?         
	Misbah is fully fit but it all depends on the match situation. I am flexible when it comes to the batting order. At one stage, I thought I would not go out to bat today (Thursday) but then I did and got some runs. Maybe Misbah will bat higher in the next match.         
	On the slow start made by the team         
	These days, nothing is stable in Pakistan. So how can our team be stable? This is our nature. We have always been slow starters, but now we are in the final. Nobody expected us to come this far.         
	On switching Guls end         
	There was nothing special about it. Fawad Alam generally does not get a chance to bat or bowl. So I thought I would give him an over. I gambled a bit like I did with Mohammed Aamer in the last over. In a Twenty20 game, you have to take chances with players like Aamer and Alam.         
	Plans for the final         
	There is no plan for the final. We just want to go out there and play our natural game. I still believe Twenty20 is for entertainment, because there are no big teams left in the tournament.         
	Criticism by Abdul Qadir         
	He has criticised two players  myself, and Shoaib Malik, who has taken the comments to heart. I would say if you have left the scene, dont talk about it, even Islam teaches you that. [Qadir made the comments after quitting as chief selector of Pakistan]. Our performance is there for everyone to see.         
	On Afridis innings         
	Afridi is a match-winner. Whenever his bat talks, we come out winners. Abdul Razzaq was in the ICL. So he will take some time to be up there again. We thought we were short of 15-20 runs.

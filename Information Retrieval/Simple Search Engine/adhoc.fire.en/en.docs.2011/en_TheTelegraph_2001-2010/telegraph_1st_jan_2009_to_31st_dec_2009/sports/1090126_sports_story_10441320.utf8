The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ECB yet to hand over contracts 
                                                   ECB yet to hand over contracts 
            Nick Hoult                      
	Just when it seemed that months of laborious negotiations over the central contracts were at an end, it appears the players and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) still have issues to settle, and the Indian Premier League (IPL) continues to offer a potentially damaging distraction as the team prepare for the opening Test in the West Indies.         
	Sean Morris, chief executive of the Professional Cricketers Association, told this newspaper: The players have signed the contracts but they are on my desk and I am holding on to them until we get resolution on this. The players have asked me to make sure the finer details are all in place before they are released.         
	Lalit Modi, commissioner of the IPL, reaffirmed on Saturday that he wanted a two-year commitment from the players who are hoping to be bought in next months auction.         
	The ECB, however, are in a difficult position because the dates for the 2010 IPL have not been released, making it problematic to offer a commitment to Modi and the players.         
	If the 2010 IPL is played in its usual slot in April-May it will clash with the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean and Englands home Test series against Bangladesh.         
	While ensuring the future of Test cricket is a valid argument when England are to play the West Indies, it may be much tougher to persuade the players to forego IPL millions to play against Bangladesh.         
	The IPL may finally be granted an official tournament window this week, which would be ideal for all parties. A meeting of the International Cricket Council in Australia will try to reshape the calendar, with sources suggesting the Asia Cup will be scrapped and the World Twenty20 and IPL brought forward.         
	It is up to the ECB and the BCCI to organise fixtures going forward that leave a window for the IPL so there is not a clash for 2010, said Morris. The ball is in their court.

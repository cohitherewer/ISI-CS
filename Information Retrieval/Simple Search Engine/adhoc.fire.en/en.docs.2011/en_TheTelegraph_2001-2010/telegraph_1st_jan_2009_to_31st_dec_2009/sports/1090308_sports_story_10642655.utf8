                                                     Administrators must treat all lives as significant: Taufel
    - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 
  -  Worlds numero uno umpire reflects on the Lahore mayhem             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                    
	Calcutta: A back injury put an end to Simon Taufels hopes of making it big as a fast bowler. The New South Welshman, though, took to umpiring and quickly made an impact with a high percentage of correct decisions.         
	Adjudged No.1 by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for five years in a row, the 38-year-old Taufel was in Lahore when terrorists ambushed the Sri Lanka team bus and the match officials vehicle.         
	That was on Tuesday.         
	On Saturday, Taufel spoke to The Telegraph at length (almost half-an-hour, in fact) from his Sydney residence. Today, Ive stayed away from the computer and emails... Ive tried to spend quality time with my children, he said.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q Youve now had more time to reflect on the close shave in Lahore. What, then, are your feelings?         
	A My strictly personal feelings are pretty much the same but, yes, Ive had time to reflect on the lives lost... Be concerned about my colleague (fourth umpire Ahsan Raza)... Reflect on the uncertainty which cricket faces... I do feel sorry for the cricket-loving public of Pakistan... Ive received a number of messages from friends there, whore sorry for what happened... Theyre feeling bad. I can understand their sentiments.         
	What were your thoughts when the driver of the Toyota Coaster, Zaffir, got killed in the very first round of firing by the terrorists?         
	Peter (Manuel, the ICCs regional umpires performance manager) and I had been sitting right at the back... I didnt immediately get to know that our driver, whod just been doing his job, had been killed... The overriding thought, the first one, was whether wed get out of it all... When would the firing and the grenades stop? At the same time, I tried to remain positive and wasnt convinced that my time indeed was up... You could say Id been quietly confident that morning.         
	You must have prayed...         
	Im a spiritual person at heart and I did fall back on my faith... Did seek divine assistance.         
	How long did the attack last?         
	Look, mate, we werent looking at our watches... My guess would be between seven and 15 minutes... I cant, obviously, be absolutely accurate.         
	On returning home, you said that on the security-scale, match officials had been promised nine, but got delivered two out of 10... What had been the assurances?         
	That our security would be of the level given to Presidents... The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) operations people had asked us not to worry and, having never faced problems in the past, I didnt have reason to be anxious.         
	Didnt the ICC make its own assessment?         
	Im not aware... What I do know is that wed sent some questions to the ICC and the ICC got back to us after referring them to the PCB.         
	But shouldnt the ICC have done something independently?         
	Im not a security expert... As Ive said, I know the ICC went back to the PCB with our questions... One expects people to do the job theyre expected to... There are certain things which you accept on face value.         
	[Hours after the interview, speaking exclusively, an ICC spokesman confirmed that the world body hadnt commissioned an independent review.]         
	Did you, at any time, have misgivings over travelling to Pakistan for the Test series?         
	No, because of the positive experiences there over the past many years.         
	What about the family (wife Helen, sons Harry and Jack, daughter Sophie)?         
	(Laughs) Irrespective of the country Im headed for, they get concerned every time I leave Sydney for an assignment.         
	Did you, in the lead-up to Tuesday, sense something was amiss?         
	Not at all, it seemed business as usual. Of course, there used to be political demonstrations (because of the Supreme Court judgement against the Sharif brothers), but nothing more... Those demonstrations had restricted our movements in Lahore.         
	Youve raised a question which the world is asking: Why was no terrorist killed or even caught?         
	Indeed, it left me amazed... At this point, I have more questions than answers... Im willing to help the investigating agencies, for I want cricket to blossom not contract. As Ive told you, Ive already had a session with our Federal Police (on Friday).         
	Reports have suggested that the terrorists actually wanted to hold the match officials hostage and use them for a trade-off with Islamabad...         
	Ive heard of that, yes, but its mere speculation at this stage. Id rather not comment on speculation.         
	Has Lahore changed cricket forever?         
	Nothing is forever and I never say never... Certainly, in the short term, the impact will be significant Id like to be optimistic, though... Once the political issues and terrorism are dealt with, then things could get back to normal.         
	So, whats the top lesson to learn?         
	Its an interesting question... Not easy to answer too... Look, my response has to be purely personal... The administrators must treat all lives, including that of drivers, as significant... Theyve got to provide a safe working environment... One accepts that terrorists could strike anywhere, but the administrators have to take care... Theyve got to protect everybody... Players, umpires, Match Referees, liaison officers, drivers... Like Ive pointed out, our driver was only doing his job Yet, he got killed.         
	The PCB chairman, Ejaz Butt, has attacked Match Referee Chris Broad for his condemnation of (or, rather, a lack of) the security arrangements. Whats your take?         
	Id rather not react... All Ill say is that I hope the administrators learn from Tuesday morning and ensure that nobody is ever again placed in the situation we were in.         
	Have you been in touch with Razas family?         
	Not with his family, but Ive been getting news from other colleagues in Pakistan. Im glad hes recovering fast.         
	Would you go back to Pakistan?         
	Its a hypothetical question... If stronger processes are in place, then Id consider... Right now, I dont see international cricket happening there for some time.         
	The final one: Your next assignment is in New Zealand (most probably in the first Test against India, in Hamilton, from March 18), which is far removed from Pakistan. Still, would there be a degree of uneasiness on the first morning?         
	No... It will be like any other assignment and Ill be preparing myself with positive thoughts... Counselling is on the cards and it will involve the family.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bolt turns on heat
                                                     Bolt turns on heat

	Berlin: Usain Bolt burnt up the track during Wednesdays 200m semi-finals, looking set for an assault on a second world record at the World Championships.         
	On the eve of his second medal race, Bolt thrived in 26 degree C heat in Berlin, running hard before closing it down just past the halfway mark and strolling past the line in 20.08 seconds.         
	If he had pushed, Bolt could easily have broken Tyson Gays 2007 Championship record of 19.76 seconds. Bolts world record stands at 19.30. Defending champion Gay is injured and out of the 200, and American teammate Shawn Crawford had to push harder to qualify as third in Bolts heat.         
	In the second semi-final heat, American sprinter Wallace Spearmon finished first in 20.14, edging Steve Mullings of Jamaica.         
	The temperature is set to exceed 30 C at the Olympic Stadium on Thursday, and Bolt loves the heat. He cut through the swelter of Beijing last year on his way to three Olympic gold and as many world records.         
	Bolt will be looking to give his Caribbean nation a 3-0 edge over the United States in sprint events, bringing Jamaica closer to the 5-0 thrashing of Beijing.         
	Defending womens 200 champion Allyson Felix will try to lift the gloom hanging over the American sprint team when she enters qualifying for the 200. But much like the American runners facing Bolt, Felix will have to battle the surging Jamaican women sprinters.         
	After being the big star, with three gold at the last World Championships in Osaka, Felix was upstaged at the Beijing Olympics in the 200 by Veronica Campbell-Brown. So far, the Americans have three golds and seven medals overall, ahead of Russia with two gold and seven total. Jamaica have two gold and five medals overall.         
	Olympic champion LaShawn Merritt and defending champion Jeremy Wariner left little doubt the US could count on another gold in Fridays 400 final, firing each other up for another battle for one-lap supremacy. Merritt looked at the stadium clock to make sure of winning his semifinal heat and still set a world leading time of 44.37 seconds. Wariner coasted to a 44.69.         
	What looked like a guaranteed gold for Cuba with Dayron Robles in the 110 hurdles suddenly looked very shaky when the Olympic winner hit the first obstacle and struggled throughout to get to the semi-finals with the slowest qualifying time.         
	Meanwhile, India ended their miserable campaign with women discus throwers Seema Antil and Krishna Poonia failing to qualify for the final round. (Agencies)

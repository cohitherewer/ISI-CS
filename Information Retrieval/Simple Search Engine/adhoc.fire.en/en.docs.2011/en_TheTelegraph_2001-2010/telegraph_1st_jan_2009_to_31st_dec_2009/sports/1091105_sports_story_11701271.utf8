The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nielsen: 5-match series would have been nice 
                                                                                                                                     Nielsen: 5-match series would have been nice 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad: The Australians, no doubt, have been rattled by the spate of injuries that has rocked them on this tour. Coach Tim Nielsen said at a media conference on Wednesday that a five-match series would have been nice in the circumstances.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Moises Henriques absence         
	There is every reason to be upset that Moises wont be there. The most difficult part is that in every game there has been a change in the side because of injuries. As far as consistency is concerned, we are happy that weve been able to perform. Having said that, Im pleased with the way the players have fought. The seniors and youngsters have adapted to different roles Ricky opened the batting and Shaun Marsh has batted in the middle order.         
	 The injuries         
	It is never easy to be saddled with injuries before the match has begun. Were really excited about the young players. Every time somebody takes rest or gets injured, it gives another player an opportunity to play for Australia.         
	The demanding itinerary         
	It is pretty much the same around the world. Tournaments like the IPL and the Champions League make the schedule more hectic. But we have managed quite well. A seven-game series is a bit demanding on the players and five would have been nice and right in the circumstances. But youve got to realize that other things, like TV rights, are also involved in determining these things.         
	Mitchell Johnsons performance         
	He didnt have a great game the other night. I hope that he gets better. He is a sort of bowler who can make a comeback because he bowls quickly. He is a left-armer, he can angle across the right-handers, specially to a player like Sehwag. He has a lot of potential. In a couple of games he will be okay.         
	Doug Bollingers show         
	I think he is up to the contest. He runs in hard. He bowled beautifully in Mohali. He got important wickets for us in Delhi. He is really positive. At the moment he is putting on a fine performance at every opportunity that he is getting. He is a big kid, brings the ball from a height and gets a little bounce.         
	Ravindra Jadejas bowling         
	We didnt know much about him. He is a bits and pieces player... We certainly did not expect his left-arm orthodox spin to have more impact than his batting. He has played well.         
	If Yuvraj Singhs batting is a worry for him         
	He is a fine player. He batted so well in Delhi. He paced his innings well... got runs on a difficult wicket. He has the ability to time the ball sweetly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Winning is a habit, says Gambhir
                                                   Winning is a habit, says Gambhir
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	The Delhi DareDevils stand-in captain Gautam Gambhir lauded his bowlers for their seven-wicket victory over the Kolkata Knight Riders in their Indian Premier League (IPL) match on Sunday.         
	The bowlers set up the match for us. It was a brilliant effort from them to restrict the Knight Riders to a paltry total. They were reduced to three for nine and that, I think, put us in an advantageous situation, said Gambhir, who scored 18 in the match.         
	The left-handed India opening batsmen also appreciated the efforts of South African A.B. de Villiers, who top scored for the Delhi side with an unbeaten 40.         
	AB was great today (Sunday). We have not been chasing too well in the IPL. It was important for someone to hang on till the end to see us through. If we have wickets in hand, we can always accelerate later. AB did that job well for us in this match, he said.         
	Gambhir also stressed on the importance to continue the winning momentum saying it will be extremely difficult to recover from any slip-up.         
	We still have five more games to play. We have to continue winning. Winning is a habit and we have to maintain that. It will be difficult to recover from any loss at this stage of the tournament, he explained.         
	Losing captain Brendon McCullum admitted that his side didnt put up enough runs on the board on a dry pitch.         
	We certainly didnt have enough runs on the board. Three quick wickets at the start pegged us back. With only 123 on the board, our bowlers tried hard. But in the end, the better team won, he lamented.

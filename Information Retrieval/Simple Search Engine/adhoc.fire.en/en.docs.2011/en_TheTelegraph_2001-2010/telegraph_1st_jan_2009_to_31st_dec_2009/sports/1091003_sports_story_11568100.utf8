The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dempo take on Mumbai FC
                                                   Dempo take on Mumbai FC
                      
	Mumbai: Dempo SC appear to carry too big an artillery for the comfort of the revamped Mumbai FC when the two clash in an I-League match at the Cooperage here Saturday.         
	A virtual player exodus, in addition to the departure of coach David Booth and manager Henry Menezes, has considerably weakened Mumbai FC.         
	Dempo, with an outstanding record of having won the league title thrice in the last five seasons  including back-to-back crowns in 2006-07 and 2007-08  would be eager to start off with a bang against the home team.         
	Meanwhile, the match between Salgaocar and Viva Kerala which was to be played on Saturday in Goa has been postponed due to heavy rain. If rains continue on Saturday, the match between Sporting Clube and Air India, to be held on Sunday, too will be postponed.           (PTI)

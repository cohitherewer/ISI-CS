                                                   BHA leads demand for elections
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Bengal Hockey Association (BHA) on Wednesday raised the banner of revolt against the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), alleging the parent body was unnecessarily delaying the elections for the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF).         
	Addressing a press conference, the president of the BHA, J.B. Roy, said that he, along with representatives of 28 other member associations, would meet M.S. Gill on Thursday to demand immediate elections for the IHF. We will also meet the IOA officials and request them to start the process of conducting, Roy said.         
	The BHA chief, considered a hot contender for the post of IHF president, paraded 28 representatives of different state associations in the press conference. Roy denied that he was eyeing the top chair in the IHF but claimed he had the support of the majority.         
	The game is in complete mess in the country and the IOA has introduced the ad hoc culture, Roy said. We have waited for nearly a year now. IOA president Suresh Kalmadi promised to hold the elections as soon as possible but nothing has been done.         
	Roy contested IOAs claim that elections are not possible till the case filed by K.P.S. Gill is settled in the Delhi high court.

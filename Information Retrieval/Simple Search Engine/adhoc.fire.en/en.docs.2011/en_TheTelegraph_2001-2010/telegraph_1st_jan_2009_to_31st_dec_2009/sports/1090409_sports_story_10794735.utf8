The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Crowe joins the late declaration chorus
                                                   Crowe joins the late declaration chorus
                      
	Wellington: Former New Zealand coach Martin Crowe feels that Team India have messed up with the timing of their declaration in the recently drawn third Test and urged Mahendra Singh amp; Co. to be more careful with the weather forecasts in future.         
	As predicted, India should never have messed with the Wellington weather Gods. Even in hindsight there was no need to gamble by batting on and on. They had plenty of runs and only needed plenty of playing time. In the end they ran out by about 30 minutes. Anyway thats Indias miss, Crowe said.         
	They are at the height of their powers with a few years to come. So no matter where they tour, they will always be contenders for the world crown. They just need to take more notice of weather forecasts, Crowe wrote in a cricket website.         
	Unlike many, Crowe feels the pitches for the Test series were the best that New Zealand has produced in a while. Looking back on the tour, it was colourful and entertaining. Despite the weather showing an inconsistent nature at times, the pitches were very good, probably the best ever produced in this country, he said.         
	Batsmen prospered in the main with Indias vaunted line up rarely tested, he added.         
	Crowe lauded the Indian batting line-up particularly openers Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir.         
	Virender Sehwag may have missed out on a big one in the Tests but he thrived in the ODIs and continues to show why he is the most feared in world cricket today.         
	Gautam Gambhir was a magician during the Tests. He grew an extra leg with his heroics and enabled India to always be in charge through the series. Most admirably, he proved he can adjust to pressure situations as he did in Napier, he said.         
	Crowe said the senior trio of Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman also proved their worth.         
	The trio were consistently superb and the only blemish was that Dravid didnt post another ton. (PTI)

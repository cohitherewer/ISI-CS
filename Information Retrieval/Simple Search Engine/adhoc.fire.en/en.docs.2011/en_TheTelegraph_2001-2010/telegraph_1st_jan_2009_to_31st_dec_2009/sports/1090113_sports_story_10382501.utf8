                                                     Barcelona leave it till late vs Osasuna, Real romp

	Madrid: Leaders Barcelona needed two goals in the last ten minutes to beat bottom club Osasuna 3-2 away, and move 12 points clear at the top of the Primera Liga on Sunday.         
	Xavis brave strike in the 80th minute levelled the scores at 2-2 and Lionel Messi cut in from the right flank to bury a shot in the far corner four minutes later.         
	Barcelona move to 47 points from 18 games extending their lead over second place, which is now occupied by improving champions Real Madrid, who beat Real Mallorca 3-0 away. Sevilla also have 35 points but are third on goal difference after their 3-1 comeback win at Deportivo Coruna on Saturday.         
	Messi set up Samuel Eto for his 16th goal of the campaign just before the break in a frozen Pamplona, but Osasuna bit back in the second half.         
	Miguel Flano looped in a header from a corner and Walter Pandiani slotted home from close range forcing Barcelona on to the back foot, before Xavi and Messi struck late on.         
	Real were quickly ahead in Mallorca when in-form winger Arjen Robben raced away on a counter-attack to score after only three minutes. Gonzalo Higuain set up captain Raul to score with a deft back heel in his 500th league game soon after.         
	Atletico Madrid fell to pieces at home to Athletic Bilbao letting slip a 1-0 lead to lose 3-2.         
	Atletico are fifth with 30 points, ahead of Villarreal and Deportivo on goal difference.         
	In Serie A, AC Milan drew 2-2 at AS Roma on Sunday with David Beckham playing almost the whole game on his debut.         
	Mirko Vucinic put mid-table Roma ahead midway through the first half with his third goal in three games against Milan when he shrugged off Marek Jankulovski and blasted home.         
	Alexandre Pato equalised just after the restart when he tapped in Kakas cross and the 19-year-old Brazilian soon clipped in a superb second. Montenegro striker Vucinic again netted with a clever diving header on 72 minutes to bring the hosts level and both sides had decent chances to win the game in a frantic last few minutes.         
	Beckham, on loan from Los Angeles Galaxy for two months in a bid to stay in England reckoning, was given a surprise start in Milans three-man midfield and was tidy before being substituted on 89 minutes.         
	The 33-year-old had one shot and put in a few crosses but often dropped deep, playing as a defensive midfielder at times. Second-placed Juventus earlier cut the gap on Serie A leaders Inter Milan to four points after an Alessandro del Piero free-kick gave them a 1-0 home win over Siena.

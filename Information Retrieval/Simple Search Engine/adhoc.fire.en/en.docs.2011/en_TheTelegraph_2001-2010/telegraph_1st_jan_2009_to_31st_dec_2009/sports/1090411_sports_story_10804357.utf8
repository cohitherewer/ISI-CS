                                                   Clinical SA take lead
                      
	Cape Town: Jacques Kallis and AB de Villiers shared a century partnership to set up a comfortable 25-run win for South Africa in the third one-day International against Australia at Newlands on Thursday.         
	Kallis (70) and De Villiers (80) laid the foundation for a South African total of 289 for six, putting on 114 off 131 balls for the third wicket. With wickets in hand, South Africa were able to score 94 off the last 10 overs.         
	Australia made 264 for seven but were effectively out of the game after slumping to 114 for five with less than 20 overs remaining.         
	Callum Ferguson (63) and James Hopes (63 not out) gave the Australian innings respectability with a sixth wicket stand of 97. Australia finished with 264 for seven.         
	The win gave South Africa a 2-1 lead in the five-match series, which continues in Port Elizabeth on Monday. (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Englishman throws hat   into the ring
                                                   Englishman throws hat   into the ring
                            
	Julien Fountain, an Englishman, has applied for the Team India fielding coachs job.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Fountain, who has worked with cricket teams in almost all age-groups, sent his CV after the early exit of Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men from the Champions Trophy.         
	Till late on Thursday, it wasnt possible to confirm whether (after Robin Singhs sacking) the Board would either seek more details or call Fountain for an interview.           LPS

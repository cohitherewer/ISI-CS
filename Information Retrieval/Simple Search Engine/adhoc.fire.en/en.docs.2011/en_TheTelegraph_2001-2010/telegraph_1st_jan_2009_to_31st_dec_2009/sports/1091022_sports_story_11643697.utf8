            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal all-rounder Avik Chowdhury, who was critically injured in a car accident last Sunday, was taken off the ventilator Wednesday. The 24-year-old also spoke to his parents for a few minutes.         
	Avik had been responding to treatment since Tuesday.         
	Ruby Hospital CEO SB Purakayastha Wednesday said: He was far better today and so we decided to take him off the ventilator. His blood pressure and oxygen saturation are normal which is a good sign.         
	A medical board, comprising of six doctors, will be formed tomorrow (Thursday), to decide on further treatment. We will discuss the situation with his parents and the Cricket Association of Bengal as per the medical boards advice. An MRI scan is essential for us to start treatment of his lower portion which is still paralysed, he added.         
	However, sources in the CAB said that the cricketer will be shifted to the Apollo Hospital on Thursday. We will of course listen to what the medical board has to say But it has almost been decided that Avik will be shifted to Apollo tomorrow, said a CAB official.

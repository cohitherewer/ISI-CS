	Dempo, who took field without two key players  striker Ranty Martins and midfielder Beto  due to double bookings, are still on the top of the group with seven points from four matches. Al Muharraq, who have six points from four matches, are placed second.         
	Dempo suffered an early jolt when striker Peter Carvalho had to be carried off with a head injury following a collision with rival defender Juliano de Paula.         
	The hosts had the first chance to go one-up, but Joaquim Abranches failed to beat rival goalkeeper Sayed Mohammed from close. Al Muharraq slowly found their rhythm and came close to scoring twice. First, Sdhiyas shot missed the target narrowly. and later Hussani Alis powerful shot off a free-kick hit the bar in the 27th minute.

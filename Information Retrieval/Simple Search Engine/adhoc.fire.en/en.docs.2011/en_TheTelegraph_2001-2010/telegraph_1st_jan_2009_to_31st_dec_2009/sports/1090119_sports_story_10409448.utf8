                                                   Mahindra face Dempo
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mahindra United will look to build on their creditable performance in the Federation Cup when they resume their I-League campaign with a rescheduled match against Dempo SC here Monday.         
	Finishing was a problem for Mahindra in the first leg of the season but coach Derrick Perreira was hopeful that the team would carry the goal-scoring momentum of the Federation Cup.         
	We scored nine goals in three matches, so thats a positive sign. We played well but narrowly missed out on qualifying by goal difference, Perreira told The Telegraph on Sunday.         
	The match was originally slated for November 27 but was postponed following the terror attacks in the city the day before.

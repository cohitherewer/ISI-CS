The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Air India held by Mumbai FC 
                                                   Air India held by Mumbai FC 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: First Air India were blessed by the Hand of God and, then, they were cursed by the Hand of the Devil.         
	As poetic justice goes, Bimal Ghoshs men took the lead against Mumbai FC through a hand-aided goal by ND Opara but were denied victory as the city rivals scored in added time from a penalty from a hand ball.         
	The outcome of the fifth round I-League encounter was a nail-biting 2-2 draw, which improved Air Indias tally to five points and that of Mumbai FCs to three.         
	Interwoven in the plot were the four goals. Opara, who scored a brace, put his team ahead twice, only for Mumbai FC to make a spirited fightback and find the equalisers.         
	Opara put Air India ahead in the 37th minute when, locked in a tussle with rival custodian Nidhinlal, he handled the ball before unleashing a fierce drive into the net.         
	Jamils men pulled level when Dane Pereira struck within six minutes of coming on for Nishant Mehra.         
	Opara, then, beat Bernard Achaw and Nidhinlal to score his second in the 83rd minute.         
	Harpreet Singh blocked with his hand inside the box and Noel Wilson held his nerve to convert the penalty that came at death.

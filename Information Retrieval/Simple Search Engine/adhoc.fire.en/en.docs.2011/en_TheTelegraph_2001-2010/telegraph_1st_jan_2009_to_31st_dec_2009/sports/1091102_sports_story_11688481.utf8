The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Butt: Im hopeful 
                                                       Butt: Im hopeful 
                  Ejaz Butt                     
	The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman, Ejaz Butt, reached Chandigarh late on Sunday.         
	Butt will be watching Mondays ODI between India and Australia in neighbouring Mohali and is expected to hold informal discussions with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, Shashank Manohar.         
	Im hopeful... Inshallah, things will smoothen out, Butt told The Telegraph soon after landing in Chandigarh. Bilateral ties between India and Pakistan have, once again, ceased.         
	The PCB chief, incidentally, is staying at the residence of an industrialist friends family.         
	Manohar apart, other BCCI officials are also expected to be present during the day-night match in Mohali.                 LPS IN CHANDIGARH

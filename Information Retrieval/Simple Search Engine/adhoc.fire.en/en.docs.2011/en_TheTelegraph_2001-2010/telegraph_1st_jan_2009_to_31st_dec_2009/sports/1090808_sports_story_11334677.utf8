The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India beat Belgium, win Test series
                                                   India beat Belgium, win Test series
                      
	Braxgata (Belgium): Arjun Halappa and Dhananjay Mahadik sounded the board as India beat Belgium 2-0 in the final Test to clinch the three-match hockey series 2-1 here on Friday.         
	After losing the opener on Tuesday, India bounced back winning the second Test 4-3 and the visitors Friday scored once in each half through Halappa (31st minute) and Mahadik (60th) to win the series.         
	The Indian midfield sparkled with swift rotations and overlaps which bewildered the Belgians.         
	Gurbaj Singh, Sardar Singh, Mahadik and Prabodh Tirkey kept a steady flow of passes among themselves and frequently stepped up the pace to set up attackers Rajpal Singh, S.V. Sunil, Tushar Khandker and Shivendra Singh.         
	India made their intentions amply clear with onslaughts from the start of play as the forwards penetrated in Belgiums danger zone repeatedly.         
	India eventually got the better of the Red Lions with a display of well manoeuvred skills and position interchanges.         
	They took the lead through a classic foray from the left flank where Khandker and Prabhjot moved in tandem at the baseline to set up Halappa who tapped past the hopelessly unbalanced Vincent.         
	India scored their second goal in the 60th minute from a penalty corner as Sandeep pushed the ball to Mahadik atop the circle. India later left for Barcelona to begin the third leg of their Europe tour with a three-Test series at Terassa against World No. 4 Spain.

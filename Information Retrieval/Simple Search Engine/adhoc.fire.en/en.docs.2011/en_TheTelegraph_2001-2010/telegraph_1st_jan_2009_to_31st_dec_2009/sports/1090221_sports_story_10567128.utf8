                                                     John has Wright ideas for hosts
                  John Wright                     
	Wellington: A five-year coaching stint with Indian cricket under his belt, John Wright, now a New Zealand national selector, says he has the ideas that can help Daniel Vettoris men beat the visitors in the upcoming series.         
	India have not won a Test series in New Zealand for the past 41 years. Wright coached the team between 2000-05 and was here when they were blanked 0-2 six years ago.         
	Im on the other side now and that may be helpful. I have a few ideas but it always boils down to what happens on the park, the accuracy and quality of the cricket our blokes play, Wright was quoted as saying by a newspaper.         
	India kick off their tour here with a couple of Twenty20 games followed by a five-match one-day series and three Tests.         
	Recalling the Test series that India lost in 2003, Wright said the seaming tracks would still be fresh in the visiting players minds and they would be eager to see how the pitches have been prepared this time around. Theyll be interested to see the first pitch. They have not won (a series) here for 41 years. Theyll definitely want to put that right but I dont think they think about settling old scores, he added.         
	The tour before, their batters did well, Dravid got a couple of hundreds at Hamilton, so he will have good memories of that, said the former India coach.         
	My recollection from last time was they were extreme conditions and probably not the best for watching, so lets hope there is a bit more even balance because they are the most exciting batting lineup to watch, Wright said.         
	Youve got a bloke like Sehwag when hes on, it doesnt matter what the wicket is like, he added.         
	As far as the Tests are concerned, Wright feels New Zealands new ball bowlers will be key to putting pressure on the Indians.         
	If you can get early wickets, then it will be interesting. It is probably the same with most sides that come here, but they (India) wont have forgotten the last experience here. Sometimes those ghosts are hard to hide, so the key is putting them under pressure early and just bowling in a very tight area.         
	The former New Zealand batsman believes the difference between India in 2003 and now is the strength and balance of the bowling attack.         
	Speedsters Ishant Sharma and Zaheer Khan have had a phenomenal season and will be backed up by the guile of off-spinner Harbhajan Singh and the deceptive leg-spin of Amit Mishra.         
	India must be very excited about his (Ishants) potential. Weve only seen him bowling in subcontinental or Australian conditions, where its pretty hard work for the pacemen, he said.         
	Youd expect once he gets to a place like New Zealand or England, where the conditions favour the seamers more, hell be at least as influential again, said Wright.         
	Zaheer has really matured, he has come of age. He had a spell of county cricket with Worcester and just did lots of bowling and that did him a lot of good. He hasnt really looked back since then.         
	Wright feels India might opt to field an extra seamer in Munaf Patel at the cost of one of the spinners. The former India coach also had a word of praise for skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	Hes done outstandingly well to lead India at such a young age with some big people in the side.         
	Asked about Sachin Tendulkar, Wright said it would be good to see him in New Zealand. (PTI)

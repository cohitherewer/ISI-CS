            STAR RACER                          Vivek				                           
	Calcutta: Trainer Havinder S. Baths colt, Secret Whispers, enjoys a thick edge over Arctic Force and Spectacular Style in the 1,400m Flying Saucer Handicap, the main event in Thursdays six-event card. The three horses are closely handicapped but the Whispers marginal advantage at the weights may tilt the scales in his favour. Vivek partners the three-year-old.          
	Trainer Pesi Shroffs classic youngster Terrazas, too, may come good in the 1,400m Nikita Handicap. The well-rested Glory Of Dancer-Licata progeny has had an easy mock race early this month. The horse had finished close behind Credit Squeeze last winter in the Million. Trainer D.Byramjis ward Agility is the other one who may be hard to beat in the Treasure Land Handicap. The China Visit filly is looking much improved after her recent win in Bangalore.

	Napier: New Zealand lock horns with Pakistan in the third and final Test that begins Friday knowing that they would need a vastly improved show with the bat to have any chance of victory in the series decider.         
	The three-match rubber is currently tied 1-1 after Pakistan produced a brilliant bowling display at Wellington to win the second Test by 141 runs. The hosts had triumphed in the first Test.         
	According to cricinfo, the track at McLean Park, the venue of the third Test, is batting-friendly and the last Test there  against India earlier this year  produced five hundreds in all, including a double.         
	Home captain Daniel Vettori has said hell be batting at No.6 to accommodate an extra bowler. He added it was a toss-up between four seamers and three seamers and two spinners. Bradley-Joe Watling, replacing Peter Fulton, is likely to make his Test debut.         
	Pakistan are likely to make one change; both Mohammed Yousuf and Intikhab Alam have said that Shoaib Malik, who has endured his worst Test series for a while, is unlikely to play. There is thus a chance of Faisal Iqbal coming in.

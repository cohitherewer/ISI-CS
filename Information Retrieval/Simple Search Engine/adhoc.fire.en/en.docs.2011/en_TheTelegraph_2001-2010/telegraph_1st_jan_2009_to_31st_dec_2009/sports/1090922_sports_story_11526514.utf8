The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Blatter sees no reason to worry
                                                     Blatter sees no reason to worry
  - Fifa president says concerns over security in South Africa exaggerated       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Joseph Blatter                                 
	Zurich: Joseph Blatter, the Fifa president, has conceded that theres no place in the world with 100 per cent security.         
	However, hes also of the view that, in the lead up to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, theres no reason to have misgivings over security.         
	A special event security structure is being put in place, as was done during the 2008 Beijing Olympics... Lets trust the South Africans... I really dont see why I keep getting asked about security, Blatter said on Monday.         
	He was speaking at the ceremonial start of the all-gold World Cup trophys global tour, sponsored by long-standing partner Coca-Cola.         
	Roger Milla, who made such an impact on the 1990 World Cup, and Muhtar Kent, the chairman and CEO of Coca-Cola, were among those present.         
	Indeed, Milla may return to Calcutta after 20 years, next January, as Coca-Colas brand ambassador to roll out the trophy there. His visit in 1990 had been as a guest of Mohun Bagan.         
	At this stage, thats a possibility, a well-placed source told The Telegraph, shortly after the days function at Fifa House.         
	Besides being a star goal-scorer in the 1990 edition, after coming out of retirement for Cameroon, Milla had wowed fans with his celebratory dance around the corner flag each time he found the net.         
	It has since taken on an iconic status.         
	Inspired by Millas act, which he re-enacted at the ceremonial launch, Coca-Cola has decided to institute a celebration award, which will go to the player adjudged to have scripted the best celebration in 2010.         
	Voting will be online and, for each celebratory dance after a goal, Coca-Cola will make an additional donation to the companys Water for Schools effort in the African continent.         
	The celebrations will have to be with discipline and respect must be shown, emphasised Kent.         
	As for Milla himself, he said: It puzzles me that people not only remember the goals I scored in 1990, but my way of celebrating... Just goes to show how unique the World Cup is... Back then, I didnt know my little dances would inspire so many footballers...         
	I hope the 2010 edition will be the most festive in World Cup history... Its a regret, though, that I wont be on the pitch...         
	You can, however, bet on Milla celebrating off it!         
	Footnote: The Bhaichung Bhutia case has been making headlines back home, but Fifa doesnt seem to be keeping track of the India captains travails. Secretary general Jerome Valcke, for example, looked rather surprised when asked if he had a comment to offer.

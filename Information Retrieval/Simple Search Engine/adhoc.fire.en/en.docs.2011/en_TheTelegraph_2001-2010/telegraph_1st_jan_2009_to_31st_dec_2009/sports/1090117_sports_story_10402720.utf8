	Calcutta: Scheduled to play two practice matches against East Bengal, the coach of the second-string Bayern Munich side, Hermann Gerland said: We are here on an exposure trip.         
	Talking to reporters after their second practice session at the East Bengal ground on Friday evening, Gerland appeared a bit dissatisfied when asked about the training facilities here. Training facilities here are not up to mark But for the youngsters its a learning process, Gerland said.         
	On his plans for the first practice match on Saturday, the German coach admitted having no knowledge about the red-and-gold brigade.         
	We really dont have much knowledge about East Bengal. But well play our own game. We have to showcase our young talent. Our visit has also got a lot to do with our academy here (in Burdwan).         
	Assistant coach Gerd Muller, who landed in the city in the morning, was also present at both the practice sessions.         
	Meanwhile, East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick said that he would not include the players who have just returned from the India camp.         
	Itll be a good experience for my team We want to see if the boys are mentally and physically ready, Bhowmick said.

                                                     Sehwag: Didnt miss McGrath
                  McGrath                     
	Centurion: Virender Sehwag insists that the Delhi DareDevils did not miss Glenn McGrath in IPL 2009 because the former Australia spearhead had not been in form.         
	I dont think we missed McGrath because he hasnt played in the last one year. He was not in that kind of form, the way he bowled last year. (Dirk) Nannes was fantastic right through the tournament, Sehwag said after the crushing six-wicket loss to the Deccan Chargers in the semi-final.         
	Asked whether McGraths experience would have come in handy against Adam Gilchrist in Fridays semi-final, Sehwag said no bowler could have stopped the rampaging Aussie.         
	I think he batted extremely well. I dont think anyone could have stopped him. It was Gilchrists day, he said.         
	However, Gilchrist said he was surprised by the DareDevils decision to not play McGrath. I am very surprised that McGrath didnt get a chance to bowl in the tournament. But you cant be too critical. They had set the benchmark during the entire tournament. They were the team who were at the top and the other teams were chasing them. Their overseas players have served them really well.         
	I was surprised that McGrath didnt get an opportunity but that does not mean they needed him to play today, Gilchrist said.         
	Sehwag said the loss was disappointing and that he was not expecting such a brutal assault from Gilchrist.         
	Nobody was expecting it to go the way it did. Gilchrist played extremely well and he just finished the game in the first 10 overs. We couldnt do anything. We tried everything; I tried every bowler. I bowled myself in the Powerplay, but I couldnt stop him. So its very hard to stop Gilchrist when he is going that way, he said.         
	It is very difficult to stop a batsman when he is in flow. If the strategy break was before the 10th over, then we had a chance. But he had finished the game before the 10th over and they required around five runs an over. It is very difficult in that case. The only chance you have is when he makes a mistake and gets out himself, he added.

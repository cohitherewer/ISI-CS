    - Captain Dhonis valiant century goes in vain                   Mahendra Singh Dhoni en route to his century, in Nagpur, on Friday. (Reuters)                           
	Nagpur: Tillekaratne Dilshan struck a blistering 123 as Sri Lanka held their nerves in the dying moments to snatch a three-wicket victory in a high scoring second ODI against India to level the five-match series 1-1 Friday night.         
	Chasing Indias 301 for seven, built around a captains knock of 107 by Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the visitors made up for their narrow defeat in Rajkot by overhauling the target with five balls to spare in a pulsating floodlit contest.         
	The explosive Dilshan notched up his second consecutive and fourth one-day hundred to lay the platform for the run chase.         
	India did well to recover from a rather sluggish start to post 301 mainly relying on Dhonis fireworks in the end, but a few fielding lapses in the fag end of the Sri Lankan innings tilted the scale in the visitors favour. The capacity crowd at the VCA Statium, in nearby Jamtha, were treated to another run feast with both teams scoring over 300 runs but unlike the Rajkot feast the bowlers did get some assistance from the track.         
	The Indians, whose fielding has left a lot to be desired in the ongoing series against Sri Lanka, were patchy in their bowling and the early dismissals of Virender Sehwag (4) and Gautam Gambhir (2) when they batted did have a bearing in the final outcome.         
	The two sides travel to Cuttack for the third one-dayer on Monday.         
	Pacer Zaheer Khan struck thrice in quick succession after Ashish Nehra got the prized wicket of Dilshan to raise visions of a second successive come-from-behind win for the hosts before Angelo Mathews, who remained unbeaten on 37, guided the visitors home.         
	Dilshan, who struck 12 fours and two sixes, and fellow opener Upul Tharanga (37) gave the Lankan innings a flying start scoring 102 in 14 overs to ease the job for the later-order batsmen.         
	Dilshan fell in the 36th over, yorked by Ashish Nehra bowling his second spell, and then Zaheer sent back Mahela Jayawardene (39), Thilina Kandamby (27) and Chamara Kapugedara (2), the last two in a space of three balls.         
	But Mathews, who used a runner in the later part of his crucial knock, kept his cool and gathered runs after having lost Kandamby in the first over of the batting power play, taken after the 44th over when the visitors were 262 for four.         
	Earlier, Dhoni cracked his sixth hundred and strung together a breezy century stand with Suresh Raina to lift his side to an imposing 301 for seven after electing to bat first.         
	Dhoni, who faced 111 balls and struck eight fours and two sixes, had the proverbial cats luck as he was let off on four occasions by the butter-fingered Lanka fielders, thrice by his counterpart Kumar Sangakkara before he reached 50.         
	The India captain punished the Sri Lankans with his second successive hundred in ODIs at this venue, following his match-winning 124 against Australia on October 28.         
	Dhoni, who fell to impressive debutant Suraj Randiv for 107 in 111 balls that included eight fours and two sixes, and Raina (68) stitched a stand of 126 in only 119 balls for the fifth wicket to lift India to the 300-plus score after the hosts were struggling just past the halfway stage.

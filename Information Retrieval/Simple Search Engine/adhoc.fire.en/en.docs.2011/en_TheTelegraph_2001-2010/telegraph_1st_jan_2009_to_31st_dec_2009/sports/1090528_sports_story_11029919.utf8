The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Flintoff backs India to retain World T20 title
                                                     Flintoff backs India to retain World T20 title
  - England all-rounder is hoping to be fit for the ashes               Andrew Flintoff                           
	New Delhi: England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff has tipped India as favourites to win the ICC World Twenty20 next month and said the Indian Premier League experience will come in handy for Mahendra Singh Dhonis boys in their title defence.         
	Flintoff said from Lancashire that Australia, South Africa and England would pose a strong challenge to India in the June 5-21 event to be held in England.         
	Indian players just played in a world-class competition in IPL and naturally they are the favourites. Australia, South Africa and England would be strong challengers. England can spring a few surprises, he said.         
	Flintoff defended his decision to play in the IPL in South Africa from where he sustained a cartilage tear on his right knee putting him in doubt for the World Twenty20.         
	My injury was not from just one event or tournament, it was over a period of time and I think ECB should not be blamed for allowing me play in the IPL, he said.         
	Flintoff underwent a keyhole surgery earlier this month after playing three IPL matches for the Chennai Super Kings and that ruled him out of the Test and ODI series against the West Indies and the World T20 at home.         
	The 31-year-old all-rounder said he was hoping to be fit for the Ashes starting on July 8.         
	I met my surgeon today (Wednesday) and he was happy with my progress. I started light running today. I am hoping to be fully fit for the Ashes, he said.         
	Flintoff spoke highly of the IPL in South Africa and said he looked forward to playing more matches for the Chennai Super Kings next year in India. IPL has become huge and I am looking forward to playing in India. I want to play a bigger role for the Chennai Super Kings next year, hopefully play the entire tournament. I think I could have done better this year but I am looking forward to next year, said Flintoff who was bought for a whopping $1.55 million but managed just 62 runs and two wickets in the three matches he played.         
	Flintoff also believes that with IPLs success the profile of Twenty20 cricket has risen and more matches should now be allotted in international fixtures. IPL has done wonders for Twenty20. Yeah, we should think about more Twenty20 Internationals but it is for the administrators to take the call, he added.         
	Flintoff predicted a Manchester United win in the Champions League final.           (PTI)

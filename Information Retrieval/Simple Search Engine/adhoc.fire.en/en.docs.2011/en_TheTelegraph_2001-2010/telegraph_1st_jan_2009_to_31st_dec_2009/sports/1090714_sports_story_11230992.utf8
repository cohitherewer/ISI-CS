The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pak team is divided, fears Inzy
                                                     Pak team is divided, fears Inzy
                  Inzamam                     
	Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq Monday said groupings within the team could be the reason behind Pakistans dismal show in the ongoing Test series against Sri Lanka.         
	I fear there might be groups in the team. I think Younis Khan has not been successful in gelling the team as yet, Inzamam said.         
	If any player is indeed involved in such things, then he should be penalised immediately by the board and team management, Inzamam told a local newspaper.         
	The former captains comments came at a time when unconfirmed stories are doing the rounds that some senior players were not wholeheartedly supporting Younis as captain.         
	Inzamam, who retired in 2007, said the Pakistan team had not been able to live up to the expectations after winning the World Twenty20. I think the players have not been able to handle the pressure which has come with increased expectations of the people who want to see more victories after the Twenty20 World Cup, he said.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Calcutta: A replacement for a replacement!         
	Getting one is today a priority for the Kolkata Knight Riders as Australias Mark Cameron, the first-choice replacement for Umar Gul, is injured and wont be featuring in edition No.2 of the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Cameron, unfortunately, is out of the scene now... At the moment, South Africas Charl Langeveldt looks well-placed to join the Knight Riders, somebody associated with the Shah Rukh Khan-owned team told The Telegraph.         
	While Cameron is 28, Langeveldt is a veteran  the 34-year quick has played six Tests and 59 ODIs, but hasnt turned out for South Africa (in any form) for a year now.         
	Gul wont be around in the 2009 IPL as the Pakistan government has denied its cricketers permission to turn out in the T20 tournament.         
	Edition No.2 will be played between April 10-May 24.

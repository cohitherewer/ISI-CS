The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Massa back on his feet again
                                                   Massa back on his feet again
                      
	London: Ferraris Felipe Massa will leave intensive care on Wednesday after taking his first steps since he fractured his skull in a crash at last weekends Hungarian Grand Prix, the Formula One team said.         
	The champions said on their website that the Brazilians condition was improving steadily in Budapests AEK military hospital.         
	The driver has had more exams carried out, confirming his continuing improvement, the team said. Felipe speaks, can sit upright and was even able to take his first steps. Today (Wednesday) he will leave intensive care.         
	Massa underwent emergency surgery on Saturday after being flown to the hospital in what doctors said was a life-threatening condition.         
	The 28-year-old was hit on the helmet during qualifying by a metal spring, the size of a Coke can and weighing almost a kilo, that fell off compatriot Rubens Barrichellos Brawn car and bounced down the track.         
	From the clinical and radiological point of view everything is going extremely well, said Ferrari. Felipe will stay at the AEK hospital for the next few days, until he can be taken somewhere else.         
	On Wednesday, Brazilian driver and friend Popo Bueno said Massa had asked about his chances of racing in Valencia in three weeks, the next race on the F1 calendar.         
	Friends and relatives want to see him well, at home, healthy. But the driver always wants to return to racing soon, Bueno said. But only the doctors can know if he will be able to return this year or the next.         
	And the doctor treating Felipe Massa has said he is confident the Ferrari driver will race again.         
	From the beginning I felt the trauma wasnt as extended as it was believed but the improvements have gone beyond our wildest expectations.         
	I have no doubt Felipe will race again. Im sure of that. The situation is still delicate but I believe his life is not in danger anymore, Dino Altmann told Gazetto dello Sport.         
	Altmann added that he was encouraged by Massas response to cognitive and physical tests, and revealed that fears surrounding Massas left eye had subsided.         
	Massas father, Luiz Antonio, had said Tuesday that his son still doesnt remember anything about the accident.         
	If it continues like this, maybe Thursday Felipe can be transferred to the hospital in Paris, where he would continue his recovery until he can return home, Luiz Antonio told a Brazilian sport website.         
	But we still have to obey what the doctors say. The most important now is to know that his life is not at risk.         
	Meanwhile, Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo, who went to Massas bedside on Monday when the Brazilian was under sedation, was flying back to Budapest to greet him.

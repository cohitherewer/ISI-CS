The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Houghton targets bigger teams 
                                                     Houghton targets bigger teams 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bob Houghton                           
	New Delhi: National football coach Bob Houghton said on Friday that this season the team was looking to challenge the higher-ranked teams in Asia.         
	Under the British coach, India have progressed steadily on the Asian level in the last one year. Ranked 27 in January 2008, India have now moved to 20 in the latest AFC rankings, ahead of teams like Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Lebanon.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph on Friday, Houghton said: We had a great time in the last 18 months. We won two tournaments and even qualified for the 2011 Asia Cup.         
	When I took up responsibility in 2006, we suffered some back to back defeats. Slowly the team has realised its potential and has gained in confidence. The victory in the AFC Challenge Cup proved that we have a good bunch of players at the moment.         
	Houghton said that may be the team has reached a stage where they should play against higher-ranked teams in Asia. It will not be a bad idea to play against teams like Qatar or China , he said.         
	The national coach said India would play some friendlies this year. The matches will be played as per the Fifa dates, he said. The coach also said that he expected better challenges in the Nehru Cup to be held in August.         
	Houghton said that India would be fielding their Olympic team in the SAFF Cup to be held in December.         
	I will not be coaching the Olympic team, he said. Our technical director, Collin Toal will be training the team. Since there could be simultaneous training camps for the national team as well as the Olympic team, I wont be in a position to look after both the teams.         
	The British coach sounded very happy with the current set of players in the national team. This is definitely the best bunch of footballers we could have. Even juniors like Anthony Pereira and Rakesh Masih are coming up well, he said.         
	On Saturday, a 20-member Indian team will travel to Honk Kong to play a friendly match against the hosts.

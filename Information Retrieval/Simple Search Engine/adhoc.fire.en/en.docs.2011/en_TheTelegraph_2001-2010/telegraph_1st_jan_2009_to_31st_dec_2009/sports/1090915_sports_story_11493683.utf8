                                                   Special training for Trophy
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) director Javed Miandad is using innovative techniques to prepare the national team for the upcoming Champions Trophy to be held in South Africa.         
	The Pakistani players are holding three to four extended sessions under lights everyday at the National Stadium on the insistence of Miandad.         
	A 50-over match means you have to be on the field for at least seven hours, and the way I am training these players is the right way to prepare for the conditions in South Africa, said Miandad.         
	Since the training camp started on Saturday, Miandad has focused on holding special sessions with groups of players.         
	Known for his street fighting qualities in his playing days, Miandad is using innovative methods to remove any chinks in the batting armour of the batsmen, and to prepare the players for the bouncy tracks in South Africa.         
	One method has been to make the batsmen play on a bouncy pitch with reduced width, forcing them to play straight and avoid playing shots square of the wicket. Another method has been to get them to negotiate with extra bounce by bowling short.

                                                   Australians level series
                            
	Adelaide: Twin half centuries from David Hussey (79) and elder brother Michael (75 not out) fashioned Australias six-wicket victory against New Zealand in the fourth ODI as the hosts recorded their second successive win to level the five-match cricket series 2-2, here on Tuesday.         
	Chasing 245, Australia lost Michael Clarke (14) and Ricky Ponting (15) inside 15 overs but the Hussey brothers and Brad Haddin (43) made useful contributions with the bat as the hosts cruised to 247 for four in 48.2 overs.         
	Earlier, Ross Taylors 71-ball 76 and Martin Guptills 70-ball 45 helped New Zealand post a modest 244 for eight in their 50 overs after captain Daniel Vettori had won the toss and decided to bat first.         
	Both teams now move to Brisbane for the series decider on Friday.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shane belittled role of coach: John
                                                     Shane belittled role of coach: John
                  John Buchanan                     
	Melbourne: John Buchanan Monday defended himself against Shane Warnes allegation that the high-profile coach overcomplicates things with his methods, saying the legendary spinner felt that way because he was naturally gifted and for him everything was straightforward.         
	Because of his natural gifts, for him everything was straightforward and he would accuse me of complicating things. However, Shane underestimated how easily things came to him. After all, when you have such natural talent, why would you want to over complicate things? Buchanan said.         
	What he was doing by dismissing me was belittling the role of coach, he was quoted as saying by an Australian daily.         
	Warne had taken a dig at Buchanan for accepting the role of a consultant with the England team ahead of the Ashes, saying the coachs habit of over complicating things could only benefit Australia against traditional rivals England.         
	Buchanan said he was puzzled why Warne, who has had a strained relationship with him since their days together in the Australian team, continues to ridicule him at every given opportunity.         
	Since Shane and I left the Australian cricket team his critical views about my role have continued. It is disappointing coming from someone like Shane who, on the field, has been a player and a person who has changed the face of the game, he said.         
	It is puzzling that a person of his stature in cricket, someone with iconic status, would continue to criticise me, Buchanan said.         
	It would seem at times he does not put the same thought into these comments as he would in extracting batsmen from the crease, he said.

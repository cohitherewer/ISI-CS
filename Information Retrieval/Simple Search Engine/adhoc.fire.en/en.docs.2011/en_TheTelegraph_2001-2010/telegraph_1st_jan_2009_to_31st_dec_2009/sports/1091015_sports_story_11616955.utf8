	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan and East Bengals I-League campaigns have been anything but perfect so far. While Bagan, with one win and two losses are seventh on the league table, the red and gold brigade are languishing at ninth and are yet to win a match.         
	On Wednesday, both teams, in an endeavour to change fortunes tested their new foreign recruits at practice sessions at the Salt Lake Stadium. Ahead of their derby clash on October 25, Palestinian Yusef Mezyan is expected to fill the gap in the Bagan defence while Ghanaian Abel Hammond is East Bengals ray of hope upfront.         
	Mezyan was tried out in the practice match against Peerless. Playing at the heart of defence, the tall defender looked a tad slow and the rival strikers went past him on more than one occasion. But the Palestinian was struggling with the humid conditions and that may have affected his play.         
	Bagan may have managed to register their first win (against Viva Kerala) but Karim Bencharifas boys need to brush up their skills before the next match.         
	Bagan were held to a goalless draw in the practice match. True, they fielded a second-string XI, but that, in fact, is a reason for worry since, time and again, Karim has had to fall back on his reserves due to injuries and suspensions.         
	Hammond said after the practice session: I am jet lagged So, my performance will surely improve gradually. Im comfortable in every position and wont mind if the coach plays me in the midfield.         
	I will give my best if I am given a chance in the big match (against Bagan). I dont think there will be any problem in gelling with the team since I know most of the East Bengal players, he added.         
	Meanwhile, in the Calcutta Football League, which tentatively starts Friday, Bagan begin their title defence on Tuesday.

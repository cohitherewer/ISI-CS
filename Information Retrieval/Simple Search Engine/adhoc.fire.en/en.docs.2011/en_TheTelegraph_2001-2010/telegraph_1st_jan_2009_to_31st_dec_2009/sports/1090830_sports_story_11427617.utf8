	London: Chelsea scored three goals in seven minutes to secure a 3-0 home victory over Burnley and Aaron Lennon scored an injury time winner in a 2-1 triumph over Birmingham on Saturday as the two Premier League pacesetters made it four wins from their first four games.         
	Chelseas three goals took Carlo Ancelottis team to the top on goal difference and, counting last seasons last five matches, Chelsea have now won nine in a row in the league.         
	After Martin Paterson had missed a great chance for Burnley at Stamford Bridge, firing wide of the post while unmarked, Nicolas Anelka gave Chelsea the lead in first half injury time when he turned home a cross from strike partner Didier Drogba. Michael Ballack headed home a cross from Frank Lampard in the 48th minute and Ashley Cole swapped passes with Lampard and drove a shot into the roof of the net in the 52nd.         
	Steven Gerrard scored Liverpools 83rd minute winner after his team had twice trailed at Bolton. Kevin Davies fired Bolton ahead and, although Glen Johnson equalised, Tamir Cohen made it 2-1 in the 47th minute. In the 56th minute, Fernando Torres netted his third goal in three games.

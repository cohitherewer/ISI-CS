                                                     West Indies need 162
                  Pietersen scored 31                     
	London: Ravi Boparas elegant half-century helped England reach 161 for six in a crucial but rain-affected Super Eight match against the West Indies at the Oval here Monday.         
	Bopara (55) looked in excellent touch as he reached his 50 in 43 balls with the help of five boundaries. He also starred in two crucial partnerships. He first added 56 with Kevin Pietersen and then shared a 34-run partnership with Owais Shah to help England set a competitive target in this must-win match for both teams.         
	Knowing that a win would ensure a semi-final spot, England won the toss and opted to bat but lost Luke Wright (6) early, who tried to send Kieron Pollard out of the park.         
	Then Pietersen (31) joined Bopara and the former greeted Pollard with back-to-back fours. The South Africa-born former England captain looked in good nick, showing no signs of the Achilles injury that has been plaguing him of late.         
	He was complemented well by Bopara, who batted with elan. The duo added 50 in just 34 balls but Pietersen fell soon after, going for a needless shot. He went for a big heave off Lendl Simmons but found Andre Fletcher at the mid-on boundary, ending his 19-ball stay at the crease that included five boundaries.         
	Shah (18) joined Bopara and the duo scored at a quick pace before Fletcher plucked the former at the mid-on boundary off Dwayne Bravo.         
	West Indies captain Chris Gayle then dealt a body blow to England when he trapped Bopara in front of the wicket, ending his 47-ball innings.         
	Collingwood was joined by James Foster when rain intervened with England at 129 for four. However, with the rain stopping soon, the players were back on the pitch after a 30-minute break without any deduction in overs. England, though, suffered a jolt almost immediately as Bravo trapped Collingwood (11) in front of the stumps.         
	The West Indies slow bowlers did an excellent job as England struggled to get a boundary towards the end before pacer Stuart Broad (10 ..) hit a four and a six off the last two deliveries to push the score past the 160-run mark.         
	England stayed in the hunt for a semi-final spot with the win over India on Sunday.           (PTI)

                                                     Misra: Yuki a bit raw now
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Yuki Bhambri                           
	Mumbai: Yuki Bhambri is thrilled to be part of the Indian Davis Cup squad but captain S.P. Misra feels that the 17-year-old sensation may have to wait for a while before he making his India debut.         
	Yuki definitely has great potential and he is going to play for India in the years to come but as of now he is a bit raw, Misra told The Telegraph from Johannesburg. South Africa host India in a Davis Cup World Group playoff that runs from Friday through to Sunday.         
	Besides, he came in just this morning. To expect him to be ready in two days is a bit too much, Misra added.         
	Bhambri, originally in the squad as a reserve player, was named Leander Paess replacement after the 2009 US Open doubles champion pulled out of the playoff with a shoulder injury.         
	Misra said Paess absence would affect the teams chances.         
	He is a big name in doubles and with him not there, it will affect the game plan and the teams morale as well, he said.

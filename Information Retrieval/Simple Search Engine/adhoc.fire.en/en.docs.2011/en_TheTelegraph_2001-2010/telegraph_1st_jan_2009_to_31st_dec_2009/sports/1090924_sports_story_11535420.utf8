                                                     Yuvraj Singh out of Champions Trophy
    - U-19 cup-winning captain Virat Kohli to replace injured vice-captain             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Yuvraj Singh                                 
	Johannesburg: Team India vice-captain Yuvraj Singh, a key player in limited overs cricket, is out of the Champions Trophy.         
	Three years ago, Yuvraj hurt his left knee during a game of kho-kho on the eve of the Trophy match against Australia, in Mohali. The injury was so severe that it kept him off cricket for months.         
	On Wednesday, Yuvraj fractured the little finger on his right hand in the midst of a conventional training session at the University ground here.         
	This time, hes out for six weeks.         
	Yuvraj is leaving for home tomorrow (Thursday), manager Anurag Thakur told The Telegraph.         
	U-19 World Cup-winning captain Virat Kohli will, once again, be joining the team as a replacement. He has already filled that role twice  both times in Sri Lanka.         
	Kohli replaced Virender Sehwag last year. Then, earlier this month, he was rushed there when Gautam Gambhir got injured before the tri-series.         
	Its not clear whether the team management specifically asked for Kohli, but the selection committee, headed by Krishnamachari Srikkanth, chose him nevertheless.         
	The event technical committee, constituted by the ICC, has approved the change. Not that it was anything more than a formality.         
	Thakur, meanwhile, couldnt confirm Kohlis travel plans. Hell have to get his visa first. The details should be known in the morning...         
	Indias first match, against Pakistan, is on Saturday.         
	Yuvrajs injury couldnt have come at a more demanding time, as the team, in any case, is sans top guns Sehwag and Zaheer Khan.         
	Incidentally, Yuvraj is likely to also miss the entire seven-match ODI series at home (October 25-November 11) against Australia.

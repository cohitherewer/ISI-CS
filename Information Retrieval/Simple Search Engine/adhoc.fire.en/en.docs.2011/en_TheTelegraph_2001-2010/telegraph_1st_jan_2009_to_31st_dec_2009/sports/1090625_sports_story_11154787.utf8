                                                     Saina storms into pre-quarters
                  Saina                     
	Johor Bahru: Saina Nehwal stormed into the pre-quarter finals of the Malaysian Open Grand Prix Gold badminton tournament with a straight-game victory over Porntip Buranaprasertsuk of Thailand here Wednesday.         
	Fresh from her Indonesian Open Super Series win, second seed Saina needed less than half an hour to send Buranaprasertsuk packing with a 21-18, 22-20 victory in her opening round match to set up a clash with another Thai, Ratchanok Intanon in the round of 16.         
	The world No.8 Indian rode her better net play and powerful smash to pocket the first game after going neck and neck at 14-all at one point.         
	In the next game, Saina opened a lead of 8-3 but her rival took three quick points to close the gap at 9-7 and draw level at 12-12 before surging ahead at 20-19. The Indian, however, clinched three straight points to seal the match.         
	Arvind Bhat and Ajay Jayaram also advanced to the pre-quarter finals. However, it was curtains for compatriots Chetan Anand, Anup Sridhar, P. Kashyap, Anand Pawar in mens singles and Aditi Mutatkar in the womens singles.         
	Ninth seed Arvind had to toil hard for his 21-16, 16-21, 21-16 first round win over Sune Gavnholt of Denmark. The lanky Indian then defeated Yongzhao Ashton Chen of Singapore 21-18, 17-21, 21-15 in the second round to set up a pre-quarter final clash with Long Chen of China.         
	Promising young shuttler Ajay beat Malaysian Chong Chieh 21-16, 21-8 in the first round and then got the better off Iskandar Zulkarnain Zainuddin 21-13, 24-22 in 30 minutes to set up a last 16 clash with Yun Hu of Hong Kong Thursday. Third seed Chetan tumbled in the first round after losing to Iskandar 16-21, 21-18, 17-21, while 16th seed Anup went down to Japanese Koichi Saeki 21-17, 11-21, 17-21 in a 45-minute duel.

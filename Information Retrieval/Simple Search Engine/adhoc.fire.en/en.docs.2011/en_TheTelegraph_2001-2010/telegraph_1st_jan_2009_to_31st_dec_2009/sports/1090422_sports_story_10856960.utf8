The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tikolo quits as captain
                                                   Tikolo quits as captain
                      
	Nairobi: Steve Tikolo said Tuesday he was stepping down as Kenya captain four days after leading his team to qualify for the 2011 World Cup.         
	The 37-year-old batsman offered to play on with the team for the next two years before retiring.         
	I told the boys before the last qualifying game against the Netherlands in Potchefstroom that this would be my last match as captain, Tikolo said on his return from South Africa. It has been a privilege being captain for the last seven years. I believe this is the right time to give a younger player the chance of leading Kenya into the fifth successive World Cup, he said.

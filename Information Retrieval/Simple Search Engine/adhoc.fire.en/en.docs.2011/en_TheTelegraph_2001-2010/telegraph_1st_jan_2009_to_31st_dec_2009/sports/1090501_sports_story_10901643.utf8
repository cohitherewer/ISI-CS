The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pakistan look to level ODI series
                                                     Pakistan look to level ODI series
                  Clarke                     
	Abu Dhabi: Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam is positive about his teams chances against Australia on Friday and feels that, despite being 2-1 down after losing the third game Monday, they can still win the one-day International series.         
	We desperately want to win the series for the sake of millions of fans who have been deprived of watching (international) matches because security concerns, Alam said.         
	Pakistan was forced to move the current series to neutral venues in the United Arab Emirates after Australia refused to tour Pakistan, citing the high security risks.         
	Pakistan started the series promisingly by winning the first match by four wickets. But Australia came back strongly, winning the second match by six wickets and the third by 27 runs here Monday.         
	Despite the setback, Alam believes that Australia are still beatable.         
	If you look at the results of the last two matches, they did not outplay us. We made mistakes in batting, especially in the third match, he said while speaking of his teams failure Monday to chase a modest 199-run target.         
	Pakistan were cruising along at 95 without no loss before Australian spinners Nathan Hauritz and Michael Clarke shared six wickets between them, to blow their opponents away for 171.Alam said he had asked the senior batsmen to take more responsibility.         
	We had a pep talk for two hours before training on Wednesday and I told the senior batsmen that they must stay at the wicket and put a value on their wickets, he said.         
	Pace spearhead Shoaib Akhtar, rested for the third match, will return at the expense of Sohail Tanvir. Pakistan may also strengthen their batting by including all-rounder Fawad Alam in place of off-spinner Saeed Ajmal.         
	Clarke, Australias captain, said his players would be on their toes on Friday. Obviously, they need to win on Friday but dont worry, we will be doing our best to make sure that we prepare better than we have done thus far in this series, said Clarke.         
	Fast bowler Brett Lee joined the Australian squad on Tuesday and trained with them for two days. However, he is unlikely to play as the team management is still assessing his progress towards full fitness after injury.

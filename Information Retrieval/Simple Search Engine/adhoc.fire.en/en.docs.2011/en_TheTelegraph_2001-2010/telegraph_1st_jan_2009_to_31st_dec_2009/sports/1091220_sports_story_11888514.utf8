	London: Champions Manchester United suffered a 3-0 thrashing at Fulham on Saturday to remain three points adrift of Chelsea in the Premier League title race.         
	Goals by Danny Murphy, Bobby Zamora and Damien Duff condemned United to their second league defeat in eight days and Chelsea can stretch their lead to six if they beat struggling West Ham United on Sunday.         
	Another surprising day in Englands top flight began with Liverpools 2-0 loss at bottom club Portsmouth, their seventh league defeat this season.         
	Third-placed Aston Villa moved to within two points of United with a 1-0 home win over Stoke City and Tottenham Hotspur won 2-0 at Blackburn Rovers to return to the top four.         
	Manchester City edged a cracker against Sunderland at Eastlands, winning 4-3 for only their second victory in 11 league matches.         
	A costly defeat for second-placed United began on 22 minutes when midfielder Murphy seized possession from Paul Scholes before firing past goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak from long range.         
	Immediately after the restart, in-form striker Zamora met a Clint Dempsey knockdown to half volley past Kuszczak and double Fulhams lead with his 10th goal of the season.         
	United manager Alex Ferguson threw Dimitar Berbatov and Danny Welbeck on in a three-pronged attack alongside Wayne Rooney but a superb Damien Duff volley with 15 minutes remaining sealed an emphatic victory for the hosts.         
	Under pressure City boss Hughes watched his side move up to sixth place after finishing on top in a goal fest against a Sunderland side reduced to 10 men late on at Eastlands.         
	Craig Bellamy set up Roque Santa Cruz for Citys opener and Cruzs first league goal for the club, before winning a penalty which Carlos Tevez scored to go 2-0 up inside 12 minutes.         
	Soon after Sunderland drew level through defender John Mensah and a rocket from Jordan Henderson, only for the impressive Bellamy to curl home on 35 minutes.         
	The goals continued after the break when substitute striker Kenwyne Joness header hauled Sunderland level on the hour only for Cruz to grab his second with 20 minutes remaining.         
	Earlier, Liverpools crisis continued at Fratton Park where they suffered another damaging defeat to bottom club Portsmouth and had Javier Mascherano sent-off for the second time this season.         
	Nadir Behaldj, the Algerian who will face England in the World Cup, struck the decisive first-half goal to stun Liverpool, who lost Mascherano for a challenge on Portsmouths Tal Ben-Haim before half-time.         
	And with eight minutes left Frederic Piquionne was allowed an easy second goal to hand Liverpool their seventh Premier League defeat of the season before Christmas.         
	Liverpool were without Alberto Aquilani, with a calf strain, but Fernando Torres returned after starting from the bench on Wednesday when he scored the winner against Wigan.         
	Jamie Carragher was making his 600th appearance for Liverpool but, having seen clean sheets in his 100th, 200th, 300th, 400th and 500th games that record was ruined before half time when Belhadj scored an outstanding goal.         
	Kevin-Prince Boatengs well struck volley was met with an equally impressive save by Pepe Reina but the clearance, from former Portsmouth defender Glen Johnson, fell to Belhadj near the by-line from where he dispatched a marvellous right-footed volley into the roof of the Liverpool net.         
	Prior to the 33rd minute goal Portsmouth had squandered chances with Boateng, Jamie Hara and Hassan Yebda all wasting opportunities, while Torres was inches from connecting with a Steven Gerrard cross in front of Portsmouths goal.         
	Liverpool had the chance, six minutes from the interval, to equalise when from Gerrards floated free-kick Daniel Agger was well-placed but succeeded only in heading over.         
	And in the 42nd minute Andrea Dossena caught Portsmouths Tal Ben Haim and as he fell Javier Mascherano followed up and with a second foul while also appearing to catch the Israeli around the head with an arm.

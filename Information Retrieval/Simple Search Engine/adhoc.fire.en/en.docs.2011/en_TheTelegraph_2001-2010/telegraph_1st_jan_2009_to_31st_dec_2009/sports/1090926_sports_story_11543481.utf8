The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gary Kirsten is offended
                                                     Gary Kirsten is offended
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Paddy Upton                           
	Johannesburg: Gary Kirsten, the Team India coach, has confirmed Fridays report in The Telegraph that he had absolutely no role in authoring a rather controversial document, which was given to the Mahendra Singh Dhonis some months ago.         
	The report had extensively quoted a Kirsten confidant and everything said by him has been corroborated by the coach himself.         
	Kirsten read out a statement before Dhonis pre-match media conference in Centurion and, then, left the room.         
	The statement:         
	My family and I have been deeply offended and hurt by the many allegations that I encouraged the Indian players to engage in sexual activity before a match.         
	I would like to state that I have never and, I repeat, never encouraged or told the team or any player to engage in any form of sexual activity.         
	These allegations are absolutely not true and completely against my religious and moral beliefs.         
	The leaked article was compiled by Mr. Paddy Upton and provided information for the players on the relationship between sexual activity and sports performance. I never wrote the article and read it for the first time two days ago. It has never been and never will be part of team strategy.         
	I have been deeply disturbed by these false allegations and wish to focus my attention on helping Team India have a successful Champions Trophy.

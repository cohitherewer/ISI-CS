            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: The 8-10 favourite Credit Squeeze kept his date with the Colts Trial Stakes which the Bharath Singh-trained colt lifted without a fuss on Saturday. Jockey Suraj Narredu guided the unbeaten horse, in last three starts, to victory. The Fillies Stakes, on the other hand, was a close affair between the favourite, Gloriosa and the winner Adriana. The former lost the Stakes, thanks jockey C. Alford, who appeared have ridden a badly judged race.RESULTS

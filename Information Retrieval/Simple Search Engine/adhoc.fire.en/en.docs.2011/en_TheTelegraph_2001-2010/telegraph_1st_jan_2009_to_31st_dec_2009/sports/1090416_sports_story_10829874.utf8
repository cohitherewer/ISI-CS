The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mohun Bagan have prayer on their lips
                                                     Mohun Bagan have prayer on their lips
    - I-League 
  -  Title to be decided today; Md. Sp. fight to avoid relegation             OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bhaichung Bhutia in New Delhi on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	New Delhi: On Thursday, when Mohun Bagan take on Mahindra United in their concluding I-League match at the Ambedkar Stadium, all they would be looking for is champions luck.         
	The green and maroon brigade still have an outside chance of winning the title. They first need to ensure full points against the Mumbai club, which won the Durand Cup at this venue only a few months ago.         
	Bagan know that their destiny is not in their hands as the city giants party could be spoiled by Churchill Brothers, who need a victory against Mohammedan Sporting in Margao to bag the title.         
	Yet, one still has to hand it to Bagan for their amazing comeback in the penultimate game against Dempo. Given how it went in that match it would seem champions luck is something Bagan have in abundance and coach Karim Bencharifa said he hoped it didnt run out on them when they needed it the most.         
	I am sure we can carry this luck with us, Bencharifa said after Wednesdays practice session. As a professional, I am always an optimistic person. The advantage is with Churchill but minds can make miracles. We can still pip them, added the Moroccan.         
	The reality is that Bencharifa has no other option but to pray and hope for a vastly improved showing by the relegation-threatened Mohammedan Sporting in Margao. Bencharifa, however, refused to believe that his entire team would be thinking more about the Margao match when they play Mahindra on Thursday.         
	Thats not right, Bencharifa said. We are not going to lose our focus. There is no point doing so. I have already reminded the boys about the JCT match, which we drew and later found that Churchill had done the same against Air India. We thought a victory would have taken us to the top. There is no point thinking about all these things now.         
	But the fact remains that Bagans first priority should be to beat Mahindra, something that may not be easy under the present circumstances. Without three of their key players  Marcos Pereira, N.S. Manju and Rakesh Masih  Bagan may find the going tough against the well-balanced Mumbai side.         
	The absence of the Brazilian Pereira could prove to be the biggest blow. Though there is speculation that Bencharifa might push Rahul Kumar in along with James Singh, Ishfaq Ahmed and Malsawmtluanga to manage the midfield, it may not be enough to create the needed pressure.         
	In the end, a depleted Bagan would once again rely heavily on their two seasoned campaigners  Bhaichung Bhutia and Jose Ramirez Barreto  to deliver the goods.         
	The duo has done it for years with a lot of flourish. They only need to tap into their experience and pull off one sensational coup. And as their coach observed: The legs may be weary but the minds are fresh. Bagan supporters may just be praying his words come true.

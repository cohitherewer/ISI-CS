The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ronaldo hits out at liars
                                                     Ronaldo hits out at liars
            Mark Ogden            Ronaldo                           
	Cristiano Ronaldo has declared that he wants to stay at Manchester United after dismissing as lies comments attributed to the Real Madrid director, Pedro Trapote, that an agreement has already been struck for the European Footballer of the Year to sign for the Spanish club this summer.         
	Although Trapotes alleged statement last month was quickly dismissed by United and high-level figures at Real, Ronaldos lack of form  his last Premier League goal was against Stoke City on November 11  and noticeably increasing irritation at his treatment from both opposing defenders and supporters have done little to dispel the belief that he will once again pursue a move to the Bernabeu this summer. Since accepting defeat in his attempts to leave United last summer, Ronaldo has used his words carefully, expressing his happiness at being at Old Trafford, yet opting against more unambiguous statements of his commitment.         
	However, his assertion that he wants to stay, during an interview with MUTV, suggests that the 23-year-old might finally have accepted that his future will be better served by remaining at United, who plan to offer him a new contract in the summer, rather than heading to Madrid. Ronaldo said: What people are saying now (about a deal with Madrid) is not true. Whoever says that is a liar because I am happy at the club and I want to stay here. I feel at home here and I feel very happy here.         
	Theres always speculation, not just about me, but about the future of players all around the world. People were speaking about me last summer but that was normal because of what I did during the season.         
	Ronaldo remains a divisive figure among United supporters. Many regard recent displays of petulance as evidence of his annoyance at being denied his wish of a move to Real. The players name is no longer sung by the United fans.         
	Ronaldo insists, however, that he has overcome the negativity since returning from ankle surgery in September.         
	He said: I think the people dont forget quickly what you do for the club. When I arrived to play (my first game of this season) against Villarreal, I felt a little bit of pressure, but the fans were very good and this is why I feel the United supporters are amazing. I feel at home in Manchester.         
	Sir Alex Ferguson is always important for me, not just last season, but every season. I am at this club because of him.         
	He has always helped me and I said to him, I want to be part of this club with you. I want to win trophies with you.         
	Ronaldo has called for greater protection from referees, however. If you want a brilliant league with skilful players, you have to protect them. These are the players who put on the show in the stadium and sometimes the referees dont protect us enough.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

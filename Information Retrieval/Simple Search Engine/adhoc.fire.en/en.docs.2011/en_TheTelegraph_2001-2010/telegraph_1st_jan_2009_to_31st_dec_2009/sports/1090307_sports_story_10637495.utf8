                                                   Tiff unsettles Bengal camp
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Everything doesnt seem to be hunky dory in the Bengal camp despite their entry into the final. One understands that a tiff between Ranadeb Bose, Manoj Tiwary and Ashok Dinda late on Thursday resulted in Ranadeb reportedly calling up Jagmohan Dalmiya on Friday evening.         
	The pacer is believed to have told the CAB president that he wont appear in the final if Dinda plays. Joint secretary Arun Mitra has been asked to go to Agartala on Sunday morning to settle the issue.         
	Weve asked the concerned players to keep their cool and concentrate on Mondays final. The CAB will look into it once the final gets over, a senior official said.         
	Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla, however, wants to keep all such controversies aside.         
	This is a result of nothing but sheer hard work, Shukla said after Bengal made it to the final. Everybody has given his best and that is why we are getting the results, the 27-year old all-rounder said.

                                                   U-19 player succumbs to injury
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Shillong: A Meghalaya under-19 cricketer, who was struck on the head by a cricket ball during a practice session in Shillong, died Saturday night in Guwahati after a 10-day battle.         
	Barun Passah (18) was rushed to the GNRC Hospital in Guwahati after he suffered the injury while batting on September 30 at the Polo Ground here.         
	A Class XII student of St Anthonys Higher Secondary School, Barun was preparing for a BCCI tournament.         
	Although there was a brief recovery, Barun had complained of discomfort and uneasiness after reaching home. General secretary of the Meghalaya Cricket Association (MCA), Naba Bhattacharjee said the deceased was not wearing his helmet when the injury occurred.         
	He had removed it as he was feeling uncomfortable during practice. Barun was immediately rushed to GNRC for advance treatment and operated upon on October 2.         
	He was convalescing at the hospital when he breathed his last. We spoke to the doctors at GNRC and they told us that he had developed other complications, Bhattacharjee said.         
	A pall of gloom descended upon the cricketing fraternity as the body was brought here and then cremated later Sunday. The MCA said it had taken care of Baruns treatment and had also asked the BCCI to extend financial help to the bereaved family.         
	The MCA and the Shillong Cricket Association (SCA) condoled the tragedy at a joint meeting held at the cricket ground at Polo. Officials and players of both associations recalled the talent and potential of Barun.         
	Both associations suspended their activities as a mark of respect to the young cricketer.

	Silchar: Okolie Odafe converted a second-half penalty as Churchill Brothers prevailed 1-0 over Mumbai FC in their second league match of the Federation Cup at the Satindra Mohan Dev Stadium on Wednesday.         
	Odafe scored in the 70th minute after Mumbai defender Kamaljeet Kumar handled the ball inside the box in a Group C match.         
	With this win, Churchill are on six points from two matches. They had beaten Hindustan Aeronautics Limited Bangalore 3-0 in their opening clash.         
	The I-League champions take on Goan rivals Sporting Clube-de-Goa on Saturday in their last group match.         
	The first half was evenly contested with both sides on equal terms in ball possession and shots at goal.         
	Mumbai FC had the first look at Churchill goal in the 20th minute but the free kick landed straight in custodian Lalit Thapas hand.         
	Eight minutes later, Churchill got a free-kick after Ogba Kalu was brought down. Ogba himself took the free kick and Odafes header went straight to Mumbai FC custodian Lihaz Khoya.         
	Just before half-time, Odafe, who had been mostly quite till then, dodged past a couple of Mumbai FC defenders but his powerful shot missed the target.         
	In another match, Sporting Clube-de Goa blanked Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) 2-0.

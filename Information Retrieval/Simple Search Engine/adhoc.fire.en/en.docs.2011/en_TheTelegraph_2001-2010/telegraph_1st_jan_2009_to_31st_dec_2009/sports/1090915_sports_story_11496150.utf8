The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Raj Sir had such a big heart 
                                                     Raj Sir had such a big heart 
    - Azhar very disappointed no one from BCCI was present at the funeral           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Azharuddin                                 
	Calcutta: Mohammed Azharuddin, whose first innings as India captain began when Raj Singh Dungarpur was the chief selector, spoke to The Telegraph on Monday, the day after attending the charismatic administrators funeral.         
	Azhar, now a Congress MP from Moradabad, flew to Ahmedabad (from New Delhi) and, then, drove for around two-and-a-half hours to reach Dungarpur.         
	Raj Singh was a former president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), but nobody was present on its behalf.         
	So very disappointing, to say the least.         
	In his moment of triumph, though, Mahendra Singh Dhoni didnt forget Raj Singh: He dedicated Indias tri-series win, in Colombo, to him.               
	The following are excerpts from the telephonic interview with Azhar         
	On travelling to Dungarpur for Raj Singhs last rites         
	Raj Sir would treat me like a son and I was duty-bound to pay my last respects I was, as you know, very close to him and his passing away is a personal loss In fact, Raj Sir and Kapil paaji were the only ones (from the cricket fraternity) who supported me during a difficult time in my life (for some years from the summer of 2000) Ill never forget that.         
	First interaction with Raj Singh         
	It was in 1984-85, after being selected for India I was sitting at the back of the team bus and, seeing me there, he invited me to the front That was the first of many gestures from Raj Sir.         
	Last interaction         
	I met him twice in Mumbai towards the end of March this year He didnt recognise me the first time, and asked who I was I was close to tears that day I met Raj Sir again, a few days later, and he recognised me then I felt better, but never thought it would actually be my last meeting with him He should have lived for another 10 years, at least The controversy in the CCI, a few years ago, affected him in a big way and his health began to deteriorate. I didnt find him the same after that.         
	The other gestures which instantly come to mind         
	Raj Sir met me on the morning of the Brabourne Stadiums golden jubilee match, featuring the CCI and Pakistan in 1986-87, and promised me the CCI membership if I got the MoM award. I did and, sure enough, was handed the honorary membership card that very evening! That was Raj Sir. Then, after my hundred (102, against South Africa in Bangalore, 1999-00) in what became my last Test innings, I remember hed been waiting at the boundary to applaud me back to the pavilion (Emotionally) I could list other instances         
	Raj Singhs No.1 quality         
	Humility He came from a princely family, but had no airs Also, he would go out of his way to help people, without expecting anything in return. Raj Sir had such a big heart. (After a pause) People dont seem to remember that hed been a good cricketer  over 200 wickets in 86 first-class matches.         
	His reaction when Raj Singh offered him the India captaincy, in January 1990         
	(Laughs) Everybody remembers the Mian, kaptani karo ge? bit The offer, let me clarify, came in Bangalore and not in Mumbai Initially confused, Id replied Sir, Im already the South Zone captain Raj Sir said he was talking about my captaining India! Why would I have refused?         
	Nobody from the BCCI being present at Raj Singhs funeral         
	Very disappointing Raj Sir had served Indian cricket and the BCCI so loyally, the least it could have done was to have sent a representative Remember, he never ever sought anything in return Its such a nice quality to possess.         
	Finally, whether the BCCI should institute a trophy in Raj Singhs memory         
	Of course Id even say why just a trophy? A lot many things could be done.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Easy IPL money taking its toll
                                                     Easy IPL money taking its toll
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI    
	Cape Town: The Indian Premier League (IPL) has done wonders for bank balances across the globe, but a senior administrator associated with cricket in India has said its totally ruining the emerging players, particularly bowlers.         
	Its because of the IPL that some players who got fat sums, either in the inaugural auction (last year) or through negotiations with certain franchises, are just not keen on going through the grind of domestic cricket...         
	When theyre assured of lakhs for bowling no more than four overs in a T20 match, why sweat it out in the Ranji Trophy? Somebody has to review this whole business, the senior administrator told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking in Durban on Wednesday morning, the senior administrator added: There were good reasons why most of us initially opposed Indias taking part in the first World T20 meet... Its because we were worried about the consequences... Later, other things came into play and, after India won the World T20, everything changed...         
	The senior administrator pointed out that one of the new ball-bowlers, whod made such an impact in the inaugural IPL, had been warned by his association to take care of his fitness or else hed be dropped from the Ranji Trophy squad.         
	Its fine for the players to earn money, but the IPL has changed the lifestyle of some so fast that they arent able to cope with it... Perhaps, they arent looking at a career beyond a couple of seasons of T20, the senior administrator lamented.         
	Clearly, a very different (and worrying) take on the money-spinner.

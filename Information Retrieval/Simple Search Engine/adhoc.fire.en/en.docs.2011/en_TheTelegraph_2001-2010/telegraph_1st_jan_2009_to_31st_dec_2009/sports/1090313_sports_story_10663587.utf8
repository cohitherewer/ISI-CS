                                                     Its tough to stop me: Sehwag
            A CORRESPONDENT            Virender Sehwag after reaching his century in Hamilton on Wednesday                           
	Hamilton: Virender Sehwag blasted Indias fastest ODI hundred as the visitors swept to a 10-wicket win that secured their maiden one-day series triumph in New Zealand.         
	Sehwag reached his century off 60 balls with a signature six and his awe-inspiring hitting overshadowed Gautam Gambhirs near run-a-ball half-century.         
	Sehwag later said playing his natural game has helped.               
	The following are excerpts         
	If he thought it would turn out to be so smooth         
	No, I thought the ball would move under lights, but the rain messed it up for New Zealand. When they started bowling, every ball would get wet, so it was not easy. I was playing my shots, and it looked easy.         
	His innings         
	I played some good shots, especially the hook and pull shots which I never expected to play on this track. I dont know how it comes or where it comes from, but I managed to hit the ball.         
	If he was aware of having hit the fastest hundred among Indians         
	I knew it was off 62 or 63 balls made by Azharuddin. I didnt see it though.         
	If he thought getting a 200 was possible         
	In New Zealand, yes. Because the grounds are small...         
	Any special strategy         
	We were batting normally. We didnt think about Duckworth-Lewis. We knew we needed a minimum of 20 overs. If 20 overs dont happen you cant win or lose.         
	The plan at the outset         
	My coach and captain gave me full authority to go and play my natural game. Go and hit the ball... So I was not worried about getting out. I was worried about giving a quick start to the team, and then if the middle order can finish the game.         
	The psyche of the batsmen         
	Were not worried about getting out. If youre worried about getting out, then youll not make runs. But we know our strengths and weaknesses and have been backing ourselves to play our shots.         
	The secret of his success         
	The wickets are good to bat on and its very tough for them to stop me. They are bowling into my body and Im playing my hook and flick shots to get boundaries. There is no other way they can bowl to me.         
	If he is the most destructive batsman         
	No I dont think so. Brendon McCullum is one, David Warner is another.

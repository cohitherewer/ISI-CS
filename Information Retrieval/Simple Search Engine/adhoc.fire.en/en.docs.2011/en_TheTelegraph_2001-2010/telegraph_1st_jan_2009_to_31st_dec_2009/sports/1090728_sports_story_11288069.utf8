The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pietersen: Tough time ahead for Mitchell
                                                   Pietersen: Tough time ahead for Mitchell
                            
	London: Mitchell Johnson, Australias out-of-form bowler, will be preyed upon by Englands batsmen if the paceman is selected for the third Test at Edgbaston.         
	That is the Glenn McGrath-style prediction emblazoned by Kevin Pietersen, Englands injured batsman who will miss the rest of the series after surgery on an Achilles tendon. He said: We certainly know that hes struggling and we certainly can see it. I think everybody can see that hes struggling.         
	It is something that past teams prey on in weaknesses in oppositions and I think the good thing were doing at the moment in this England team is that were preying well on guys that arent playing well in the opposition.         
	And I think Mitchell Johnson is a guy that the guys are preying on.         
	Pietersen also had a dig at the current Test team., saying that Ricky Pontings squad is a pale imitation of the personalities that featured in Englands humiliation Down Under in the last Ashes series.         
	Pietersen said: They dont have the presence and personalities we used to play against.         
	In my first 10 Tests I had Warne at first slip, Hayden in the gully, I had Langer, Gilchrist, Ponting.         
	You had all these guys behind you. You play and miss a ball and theyre telling you exactly what youre doing and what you shouldnt be doing  which I enjoyed and found a whole load of fun.

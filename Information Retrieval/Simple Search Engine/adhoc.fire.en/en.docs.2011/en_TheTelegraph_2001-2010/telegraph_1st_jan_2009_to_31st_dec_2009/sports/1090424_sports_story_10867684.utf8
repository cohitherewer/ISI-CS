            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Crisis in the Mumbai Football Club deepened on Thursday when three members of the football team management submitted their resignations.         
	According to sources, chief coach David Booth, assistant coach Arshad Hussain and general manager Henry Menezes quit their posts leaving the squad a headless body. Sources said that former international Khalid Jamil, who was looking after the under-19 squad, may temporarily take over as the coach of the senior team.         
	Earlier in the week, the Mumbai FC management informed the players that they might have to accept huge pay cuts because of the recession.         
	Meanwhile, another Mumbai based team, Mahindra United, removed their coach Derek Pereira on Thursday. The club, however, is yet to appoint a new coach.

	London: The Premiership was decided Saturday by a home draw, but a similar result has Middlesbrough standing on the brink of relegation.         
	Middlesbrough have little chance of survival after they threw away a lead and were held 1-1 at home by Aston Villa while Newcastle slipped back into the relegation zone after a 0-1 defeat at home to Fulham.         
	Hull moved out of the zone with a 1-1 draw at Bolton and the survival struggle now goes into the final round of games next Sunday .         
	The results mean that Hull have 35 points, Newcastle 34, Middlesbrough 32 and West Brom 31 with three to go down. Sunderland, who visit Portsmouth Monday, are still not out of danger with 36 points.         
	Everton came from behind to beat West Ham 3-1 with two goals from Louis Saha and Tottenham edged Manchester City 2-1 with strikes from Jermain Defoe and Robbie Keane.         
	Stoke maintained their impressive home form by beating Wigan 2-0. Thus, while United celebrated another title, the battle for survival goes on although West Brom will go down if they lose at home to Liverpool on Sunday.

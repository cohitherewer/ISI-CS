                                                   Dont fret over pitches: Taylor
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Christchurch: India should not lose sleep over the nature of the tracks here and the two Twenty20 Internationals would be enough for them to get used to the bounce, New Zealand middle-order batsman Ross Taylor said on Monday.         
	The flamboyant right-hander said things have changed a lot since India toured New Zealand the last time.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The character of the wickets in New Zealand         
	I think a lot of people have made a lot about the wickets the last time they were out here.         
	I think the wickets have improved a lot since then. I dont think the Indians need to worry about green, seaming wickets. It shows in our domestic form.         
	The little dibbly-dobbly bowlers arent having as much success as they had five or ten years ago I am sure over the next month or so, the Indians will see how our conditions have changed.         
	What the visitors need to do to adapt to the pace and bounce here         
	The idea is to adapt as quickly as possible. There will be a little bit of getting used to for the Indians but our wickets arent as bouncy as Australia.         
	I am sure after the first two T20 games, they would get used to the bounce and in the nets as well.         
	That wont be a factor come the first one-dayer.         
	It will be interesting to see how it goes.         
	Are India the best in the world now?         
	I think consistently over the last 12-18 months, India would be the best team in all forms of the game.         
	They have beaten Australia consistently.         
	Definitely, I think they are the worlds best team at the moment and it is exciting for us to play against them and see where we really are on our home turf.         
	Hopefully, we will have some success and I am sure the New Zealand public will have a good series to watch.         
	The big names in the Indian line-up         
	Not only rubbing shoulders in the Indian Premier League, but growing up watching them.         
	I think as a youngster, (Sachin) Tendulkar was coming through and it was someone I looked up to.         
	I wouldnt say I modelled my game on him but he was always one of my favourite players.

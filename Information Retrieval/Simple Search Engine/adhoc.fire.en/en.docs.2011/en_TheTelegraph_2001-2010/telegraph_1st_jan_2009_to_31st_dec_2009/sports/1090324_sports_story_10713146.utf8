The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin: It will be different
                                                   Sachin: It will be different
                      
	Auckland: The Indian Premier League (IPL) wont be the same if held outside India, Sachin Tendulkar said Monday, expressing disappointment at the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias (BCCI) decision to shift the T20 event abroad.         
	It is disappointing that the IPL has been moved out of India. We will certainly miss playing in front of our supporters. It wont be the same, Tendulkar said.         
	Obviously, the Indian public would have liked to have the IPL played in India. Due to certain circumstances it is difficult. Im sure the authorities must have tried, but it is not workable. That is the reason it is not in India. I guess we have no choice at this moment, said the champion batsman.         
	It is obviously going to be different. In India it is about home games and away games. Right now, looking at the itinerary, either in England or South Africa, everything is going to be an away game. It really doesnt matter where you play, everything is going to be an away game, he said.         
	The BCCI made the surprise decision Sunday after the government informed the organisers that it might not be possible for them to provide adequate security during the 45-day event due to general elections in the country.         
	Tendulkar said although there was no dearth of Indian fans abroad, it had been great playing matches on a home and away basis in the inaugural edition.         
	It is always fantastic to have Indian fans away from India. Support in any part of the world is always welcome. Virtually wherever we go we have a lot of Indian support and that is something that has been of strength to us. It is always nice to play in front of your supporters. But I guess we cant help it this time around, he said. However, the Mumbai cricketer said the decision did not surprise him as the schedule for the T20 event was clashing with the general elections.         
	This was expected. Wherever we play, we hope to have the same fervour that we had last season.         
	Other IPL players were echoing Sachin when they said what they would miss most was playing on a home and away basis, a format made redundant by the relocation.         
	This is what the other cricketers had to say (alphabetically):         
	LAKSHMIPATHY BALAJI: Definitely, it will be different. I am sure the IPL is trying its best to hold the tournament. So we have to accept whatever options we are getting. It is tough at present because elections are more important in India now. Its just that the fans will have to watch all the fun and action on TV instead of being a part of it at the grounds.         
	GAUTAM GAMBHIR: I think it is going to be good if the IPL happens in England because the T20 World Cup will be played there. We would have a good chance to get acclimatised to the conditions and to the wickets as well. That should be good for the Indian team. But at the same time we would have loved to play in India and spend some time with family. Also there is a lot of support for the home team. It is going to be a lot different from last time but at the same time it is going to be exciting.         
	BRENDON McCULLUM: It is a sensible decision based on the situation in India (with the elections). If you cant guarantee the safety of the players involved, it makes it pretty hard to hold the tournament. Security is first and foremost regardless of where its held. It is disappointing not to play in India because it is an amazing place. People there get right behind the tournament, but I guess what it does is create an opportunity to take the IPL on the road. You may grow a different fan base. It is going to be hard to know until we are there.         
	YUVRAJ SINGH: It is a mixed bag of feelings. We were looking forward to playing in front of home crowds, but now we have to play away. You feel sad for Indians who were looking forward to watching the IPL. But then again there are Indians around the world in places like America who cant make it to India, but maybe they can come to England. It will be different. The whole concept of home and away games is gone now. It will be all away games, no home crowd; no home conditions. We are always looking to play cricket, whether it is in India or away. The IPL is such a popular tournament, it should go ahead. T20 is enjoyed by fans all over the world. There are a lot of Indians in England and South Africa, so numbers will not be a problem.

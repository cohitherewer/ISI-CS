	London: Sania Mirza tamed world No.51 Anna-Lena Groenefeld 6-2, 2-6, 6-2 to advance to the second round of the womens singles at the Wimbledon championships here on Monday.         
	Sania next faces Sorana Cirstea of Romania, who defeated compatriot Edina Gallovits 7-5, 6-1. This will be their first Tour meeting.         
	With this win, Sania, ranked 85, has now taken a 3-0 lead over Germanys Groenefeld, whom she beat in 2004 and 2005.         
	After taking the first set comfortably Sania faced some fire in the second set as the German put up a determined fight and refused to throw in the towel.         
	Sania had her chances right from the start but Groenefeld did not let the Indian cash in on those. Sania earned three breakpoints in the first game by hitting some good winners but the German hung on.         
	Groenefeld then broke Sania in the next game, using drop shots very effectively and held her own to take a 3-0 lead.         
	Sensing danger, Sania stepped on the gas and broke back Groenefeld only to drop her own serve in the sixth game to squander the opportunity to attain parity.         
	The Indian then saved two set points in the eighth game but unforced errors dented her chances and she eventually lost the set.         
	The Indian, however, made a brilliant start to the do-or-die third set by breaking her rival in the very first game and won four of the first five games to take a 4-1 lead.         
	The next three games went with serve and the Indian wrapped up the set and match in style.         
	At the post-match conference Sania said if she had been a boy she probably would have reached for a cricket bat instead.         
	I always said maybe if I was a guy I would have played cricket, the 22-year-old said.         
	Cricket is like a religion in the country. Every second person plays cricket no matter what. If any boy is born, he is going to pick up a cricket bat, she added.         
	The Hyderabadi said she was thrilled to be playing again after a wrist injury kept her out of action for almost eight months. I was top 30 in the world, even today I am top 100 and it has been like that for four or five years, she said.         
	Sania said she was doing her best to keep the sport in the headlines after making a comeback.         
	I couldnt hold a fork and could not eat with my hand and never knew if I was ever going to play again, said Sania, who has worked hard to recover her fitness.         
	That determination has been with her since childhood. I used to swim and I used to pass the tennis court every day with my mum and said I wanted to play tennis. I was six, she said.         
	We spoke to the coach and he said, No, no, you are really small. We cant put you in. The racket is bigger than you. I remember that meeting with him.           (AGENCIES)

	Karachi: The Pakistani cricketers misery in freezing temperatures in New Zealand has been compounded by a shortage of warm clothes in their kits for the Test series, which starts on Tuesday.         
	Apparently, the kits sent by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to New Zealand have turned out to be inadequa te to counter the cold conditions there.         
	The team left directly for New Zealand from Dubai, and the kits, including track suits, blazers, sweaters, trousers and shirts were basically ordered keeping in mind the warm weather, a source in the board said. He said players have already complained to manager Abdul Raquib about it.         
	Basically, the playing kit has been stitched in such a way that it keeps the players cool in warm weather. But for the cold conditions in New Zealand, it is inadequate protection for the players, the source said.         
	Raquib, when contacted in Dunedin, admitted there were problems with the playing kit, but played down the issue.         
	It is not as if the wrong kits have been sent. The problem arose because the players also didnt bring enough warm clothes with them. But we have asked for more stuff from Pakistan, and well get it soon, Raquib stated.         
	This is not the first time that the Pakistan team management has been caught napping. During the ODI series in Sri Lanka, in August, the logo of premier sponsor Pepsi was absent from the Younis Khans jerseys for the first two ODIs of the five-match series  something that did go down to well with the cola giants.         
	Everybody is passing the buck, is what one source had said about the logo bungling.         
	Yawar Saeed had been the manager at the time.         
	That series the Pakistanis had lost 3-2 and the job in New Zealand, if anything, will be tougher.         
	After all, the build-up to the Test series hasnt been what a team that are currently ranked No.6 and looking to rise on the table would have wanted.         
	Mohammed Yousuf was named captain for the Test tour of New Zealand after Younis Khan asked for a break from international cricket.         
	The change in captaincy came after Pakistans one-day series loss to New Zealand, in Abu Dhabi amid growing criticism of Youniss poor batting form. Local media reports suggesting Younis had lost the confidence of his teammates did not help either.         
	Pakistan play the first Test in Dunedin on Nov. 24 followed by a couple more in Wellington and Napier respectively.           (AGENCIES)

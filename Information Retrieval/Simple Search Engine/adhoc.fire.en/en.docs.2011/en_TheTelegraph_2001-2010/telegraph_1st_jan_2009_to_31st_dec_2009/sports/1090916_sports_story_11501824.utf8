                                                   Huge task for the Aussies
                      
	Nottingham: England reached their highest total of the one-day International series against Australia with 299 all out in the fifth match at Trent Bridge on Tuesday.               
	At midnight, Australia were 73 for one after 14 overs with captain Ricky Ponting (23) and Shane Watson (36) at the crease. Tim Paine was dismissed for 16               
	After an ominously slow four overs when England crawled to 4 for no loss, the home side hit out on a helpful wicket and kept scoring despite the loss of key wickets.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Form a concern: Dhoni

	Mohali: Indias inconsistent performance in Twenty20 is an area of concern, according to captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who reckons the only way to improve in this format is to play more matches and adopt a different mindset.         
	We have done well in Tests and one-dayers but our performance in Twenty20s has not been that good. You just play one Twenty20 before a one-day series, and that has not helped. It was disappointing the way we performed in the last Twenty20 World Cup. We have to improve, Dhoni told reporters here Friday.         
	The problem of playing a Twenty20 game before a series is that you treat it as a preparation for the series, you think about the series and not the Twenty20. In the last match in Nagpur, we were outplayed, Dhoni said.         
	Hopefully, before the next World Cup, we would get it right. We will have the third edition of the IPL before that, which I think will help. IPL will help us get the right preparation, he said.         
	Asked whether the Indians should play more Twenty20 matches instead of one-dayers to get into the groove, the Indian captain said, We will play whatever is offered to us. If we play more Twenty20s, you will say we are not playing enough one-dayers. What is important is that there should not be an overdose.         
	Dhoni refused to blame the bowlers alone for the defeat against Sri Lanka in the first game, saying most of the middle-order batsmen did not contribute much.         
	Twenty20 is a batsmans game. The bowlers will go for runs. Just because some bowlers gave away a lot of runs does not mean they are bad.         
	It happens in Twenty20 and scores of over 200 are quite common nowadays, he explained.         
	If we start worrying just because the bowlers did not ball well in one game, well have to worry for the whole year.         
	Dhoni reckoned the Mohali track would assist the pace bowlers to some extent while the batsmen will also be able to score freely. At this time of the year, there will be some swing. The Mohali pitch is known to have some pace, so I think it will help the fast bowlers, he said.         
	Asked whether dew will be a factor here, Dhoni said: I dont think dew will be a big factor. They will spray the chemical. So I think it should not be a problem.         
	On pacer Ishant Sharmas fine show in Nagpur, Dhoni said: Ishant is really bowling well. He is looking in rhythm and swinging the ball.         
	Meanwhile, the Indian team is planning a big bash Saturday when Yuvraj Singh turns 28, and the celebrations will be irrespective of the outcome of the match. The team intends to cut a cake late in the night.         
	Its going to be special for him (Yuvraj). We will celebrate his birthday whatever the results may be, Dhoni said.

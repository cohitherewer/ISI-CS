The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - 18 for Sundays Derby
                                                                                                               18 for Sundays Derby 
            SRIMAX                        
	Bangalore: The 2,000m Kingfisher Derby, sponsored by the UB Group on Sunday, has attracted 18 runners. In fact 20 had accepted initially but two horses had to be balloted out to suit the stalling capacity. The eliminated two horses were non winners. Nevertheless, Sundays is the largest ever field vying for the Kingfisher Derby.          
	However, only four of the 18 Derby runners  Polish Patriot, Astral Flash, Jacqueline and Gypsy Magic  merit attention           
	Polish Patriot (Polish Precedent-Be Mine) is a got-abroad horse. The staying prowess of the S. Padmanabhan-trained was evidenced in his preparatory run which he won effortlessly over a nine-furlong race. It has to be seen whether the highly-rated horse has the class to make it.          
	Astral Flash (Belong To Me-Burooq) is also a quality horse but her recent hoof injury has kept her out of action for a while.           
	Jacqueline (King Charlemagne-Talita Kumi), has a real tough task at hand after her two-length victory over another Padmanabhan-trainee, Gypsy Magic (Placerville-Stunning), in the Fillies Trial Stakes over a metric mile.           
	Gypsy Magic, a full sister to the celebrated multi-classic winners like Southern Empire and Classical Act, was unfortunate to have lost the Fillies Stakes because of poor jockeyship of Wayne Smith. Gypsy Magic will be ridden by jockey Richard Hughes this time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Schumi is free to move on: Ferrari 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Schumi is free to move on: Ferrari 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Ferrari would not stand in Michael Schumachers way if the seven-times Formula One world champion decided to come out of retirement and race for Mercedes, president Luca di Montezemolo said Monday.         
	The 40-year-old German driver has worked as a consultant for the Italian team since retiring at the end of 2006 but reports say he is close to signing with Mercedes, who have taken over the world drivers and constructors champions Brawn.         
	Schumacher announced in September that he would work as a consultant for Ferrari for another three years. Asked if Ferrari would enforce the deal, Montezemolo said: No, not binding. Its clear that if he decides to take another road our agreement will no longer be valid, that is logical. You cant work with a competitor and with us at the same time.         
	Schumacher was expected to come out of retirement to replace the injured Felipe Massa at Ferrari last year, but the after-effects of a neck injury sustained in a motorbike race prevented his return.         
	Usually reliable websites are suggesting that he is close to signing a one-year race deal with Mercedes, where he would partner Nico Rosberg in a German dream team.

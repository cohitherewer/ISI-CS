The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Win takes India to final
                                                   Win takes India to final
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India sealed a place in the final of the Emerging Players tournament after a five-wicket win over New Zealand Thursday.         
	Leg-spinner Amit Mishra and batsman Virat Kohli starred in the win.         
	New Zealand won the toss and chose to bat first. Their openers were dismissed in succession by fast bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar, with the scoreboard reading 47.         
	The New Zealand batting was held together by B.J. Watling, who scored an unbeaten 94. However, the middle order failed. At one stage, they were 105 for six.         
	Watling forged an 87-run partnership with Tarun Nethula to help their team to 246. Mishra picked up four of the last five wickets to finish with four for 44 from his 10 overs.         
	India lost in-form opener Ajinkya Rahane for 24 and Naman Ojha fell almost immediately for a duck to leave them at two for 49. Captain S. Badrinath then joined Kohli, and the duo added 106 to put India in the drivers seat.         
	Kohli was dismissed for an aggressive 92 off 86 balls, but Badrinath ensured victory with a 52-run partnership with Manoj Tiwary.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brendon: We gave our best
                                                   Brendon: We gave our best
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Johannesburg: Brendon McCullum, the Kolkata Knight Riders captain, believed that they gave their best in spite of suffering their tenth defeat in the Indian Premier League against the Deccan Chargers on Saturday.         
	The following are excerpts         
	The mood in the camp after losing yet another game         
	Obviously the guys are pretty disappointed. Right through the tournament, I think, we have played some really good cricket. We have played our hearts out.         
	What exactly was the argument about in the last over?         
	Its a decision I probably cant talk about here. There was a contrast of opinions to what unfolded. I guess we will debate long and hard into the night and probably for the next couple of weeks as well. But thats cricket sometimes things dont go your way. You dont always get those 50-50 decisions in your favour. We made a mistake by not having all four men in the ring but we thought there was a theory there that calls for the ball to be re-bowled.

                                                     Jaffer, Mukund settle issue
          
	Nagpur: Abhinav Mukund and Wasim Jaffer smashed gallant centuries as India Blue crushed India Green by 88 runs here Saturday to set up the title clash of the NKP Salve Challenger Trophy against India Red.         
	Mukund and Jaffer had a huge 265-run stand, highest in the tournament for the first wicket, to lead India Blue to a massive 351 for two after opting to bat.         
	They then restricted a fighting India Green team to 263 for nine to move to the final, scheduled for Sunday.         
	Tanmay Srivastava did his best by scoring a century for India Green and accumulating 113 runs for the first wicket with fellow opener Anirudh Srikkanth, but other batsman crumbled under the pressure of chasing such a big total.         
	Srivastava scored his runs off 133 balls with just seven boundaries, while Anirudh batted aggressively, taking just 55 balls.         
	Ajinkya Rahane and R. Inder Singh got starts after their skipper Suresh Raina fell cheaply.         
	Bengal pacer Ashok Dinda took three wickets while Siddharth Trivedi and Harbhajan Singh took two wickets each for India Blue.         
	Earlier, Mukund and Jaffer hit majestic centuries after a slow start.         
	After Blue opted to bat, Mukund and Jaffer played out the first four overs quietly.         
	In the fifth, bowled by Vikramjeet Malik, they took 18 and increased the rate from there on. Dhawal Kulkarni, who began very tidily, should have had Jaffer on 28 but dropped an easy return catch during a maiden ninth over.         
	Kulkarni lost his line hereon and Jaffer went on to cross his half-century off off 59 balls. Mukunds half-century came up off 71 balls.         
	The pair batted very well in tandem, taking smart singles and rotating the strike. They maintained a constant run-rate and eased past the 200 mark in the 34th over just after Mukund was put down by Suresh Raina on 80. in the last five overs.         
	Jaffer hit 17 elegant boundaries and a six in his run-a-ball knock, while Mukunds 123-ball innings was studded with nine fours and a six.         
	Dhawal Kulkarni, who was the only India Green bowler to get a wicket, broke the partnership, when he castled Mukund.         
	There was no respite for the India Green bowlers as India Blue captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Yusuf Pathan continued bashing them. (PTI)

	Christchurch: Indias tour of New Zealand is going to fetch the host countrys cricket board a windfall with more than $25 million expected from a multimillion dollar deal for television rights.         
	New Zealand Cricket (NZC) is likely to pocket $1 million for the each of the 22 days the Indians are to take the field, making the deal the biggest in the countrys sporting history. NZC chief Justin Vaughan did not reveal the exact details but admitted that a tour by India generates many times more income than those by Australia, South Africa and England.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dyson: Have to monitor Indians
                                                   Dyson: Have to monitor Indians
                      
	Kingston: The visitors may be short on star power but West Indies will do well not to underestimate the lesser known Indian cricketers, coach John Dyson said.         
	The visiting Indian team is without their star players Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag and Zaheer Khan. The team under Mahendra Singh Dhoni includes the likes of Abhishek Nayar, S. Badrinath and Murali Vijay in the ranks  players who are virtually unknown to the West Indies.         
	Dyson said the hosts would make a mistake if they took the Indians lightly in the four-match ODI series starting at Sabina Park here on Friday.         
	We dont know how theyre going to perform and thats something we have to monitor as the series progresses, Dyson said.         
	Dyson arrived in Jamaica Tuesday with six other West Indies players, including Trinidadian Darren Bravo, Dwaynes brother, and the coach felt the youngster stood a good chance in the series.         
	If you look at the possible side that could walk out on the field, we have an extra batsman, we have an all-rounder who is also a very good batsman, normal pace and reserved pace which is good, and a spinner. Hopefully, (Chris) Gayle will be providing back-up spin to him, he said.         
	Captain Gayle has already said that he is wary of the Indians. The West Indies not only beat India in the Super Eight stage of the World Twenty20 but also laid bare their frailty against rising deliveries which was exploited well by England.         
	Gayle believes the side under Dhoni, however depleted, would seek to settle scores in the ODI series.         
	We have a big game on Friday against India. Were all looking forward to it, Gayle said. India is always a good ODI team and they will be looking to beat us based on their Twenty20 disappointment, he added.         
	Gayle said the Indians were still good enough to make life miserable for the hosts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ojha took the game away: Tendulkar
                                                   Ojha took the game away: Tendulkar
                      
	Durban: Mumbai Indians captain Sachin Tendulkar Saturday hailed the Deccan Chargers spinner Pragyan Ojha, who, he believed, took the match away from them with his brilliant spell. Ojhas three-wicket haul earned him the Man of the Match award.         
	Yeah, I thought till the 10th over, we were doing quite well but thereafter we lost a bit of momentum and lost wickets and didnt score enough runs. Most of the time we were in control but we lost it when Pragyan (Ojha) came to bowl, said Tendulkar, who made a useful 36 at the top.         
	Asked whether the strategy break had anything to do with their momentum loss, Tendulkar, a stern critic of the concept, said: This has (time out) gone against us, hopefully, next time it favours us.         
	He, however, ruled out any possibility of changing the composition of the team for the next match before having a look at the pitch. I have to go and look at the wicket before taking any decision, but I am quite happy with the way we have approached the game so far.         
	Asked whether the washout against the Rajasthan Royals had any affect on Saturdays result, he said: To a certain extent, because we were all set to play the last match against Rajasthan. I thought in those five six days in between the two matches, we didnt get match practice as such. But no excuses, I think in the next match, well be able to put up a good show.         
	Victorious skipper Adam Gilchrist was delighted with the form of his side who finished last in the inaugural edition of the event last year.         
	The Deccan Chargers have started their IPL campaign this year with a bang and are atop the points table at the moment, with three consecutive wins from as many matches.         
	Its a nice start. We picked up a little milestone. Weve already got a lot more points than last year and thats quite pleasing, the former Australian wicketkeeper said. Its nice to see the enthusiasm in the group, both among the playing and the non-playing members. The outfit is quite unified and these are encouraging signs.         
	Man of the Match Ojha, meanwhile, admitted that he was nervous while bowling to Tendulkar.         
	I was very nervous. I was bowling to the best batsman in the world. I am happy that my team backed me and supported me. They told me that if I put in the effort, I can do it, and I did it for my team, he said.         
	Ojha bowled a great line, never allowing the batsmen any room for shots. While Tendulkar mishit an inside-out shot off Ojha, Shikhar Dhawan was bowled going across the line and Duminy paid for not being watchful.           (PTI)

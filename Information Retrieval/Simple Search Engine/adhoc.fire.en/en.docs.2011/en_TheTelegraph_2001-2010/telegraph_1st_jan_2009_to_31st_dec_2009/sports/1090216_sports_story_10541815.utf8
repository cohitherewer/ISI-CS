The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Injured Nadal falls to Murray
                                                     Injured Nadal falls to Murray
                  Rafael Nadal                     
	Rotterdam: Second-seeded Andy Murray overcame an injured Rafael Nadal 6-3, 4-6, 6-0 on Sunday to become the first British winner at the World Indoor Tournament here.         
	The top-ranked Nadal was bothered by a right knee injury and had to call a medical timeout in the second set, before deciding to continue the match.         
	Thought the first set was very good, I played well and saw nothing on Nadals movement, Murray told reporters. But after his time out he wasnt running anymore and just hitting the ball hard from the baseline.         
	It was disappointing as it wasnt particularly entertaining at the end.         
	Rafael was hurt at the beginning of the second set, said Murray. On one leg he could still go on. Thats how good he is.         
	Murray took the first set after breaking Nadal in the sixth game, but the Spaniard fought back in the second. However, he struggled with his serve in the third set because of his sore knee, and Murray was able to seal the win with an ace.         
	Murray, the world number four, knew he needed to play his best tennis to beat Nadal, but neither player reached the high standard they achieved in earlier rounds.         
	After the first set and Nadals problem I really struggled with my service game and got a bit nervous, Murray said.         
	Britains Tim Henman was runner-up here three times, losing the 1999, 2000 and 2002 finals.         
	Nadal was also attempting to become the first Spaniard to win in Rotterdam after Juan Carlos Ferrero lost the 2004 final to Lleyton Hewitt for the countrys best Rotterdam result.         
	Appearing in his 41st career final, the Australian Open champion wasnt at his best, struggling to counter Murrays powerful service game. After breaking Nadals first game in the deciding set, Murray held on to claim his 10th career title.         
	Nadal refused to blame his injury for his second successive loss to Murray after last years US Open semi-final. Murray just played better today, Nadal said.         
	I tried but couldnt give anything more in the third set.         
	It was an option not to finish the match, but that is not a good way to finish a final, not for me not for Andy and not for the crowd.         
	Nadal said he did not sustain the injury during the final but that it had got worse during the week.           (AGENCIES)

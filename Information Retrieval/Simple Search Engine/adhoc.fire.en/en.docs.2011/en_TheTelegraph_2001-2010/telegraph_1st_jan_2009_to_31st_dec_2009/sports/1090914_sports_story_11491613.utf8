                                                   Impasse far from over
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Bhaichung Bhutias hopes of playing in the Durand Cup for East Bengal evaporated Sunday, when the All India Football Federation (AIFF) appointed arbitrator failed to resolve the Bhaichung-Mohun Bagan impasse.         
	The arbitrator, Amarendra Sharan, who heard both the parties for the second time at his residence on Sunday, has asked them to return for another hearing on Wednesday.         
	I have asked them to come on September 16 again. I am still hoping for an amicable solution, Sharan said.         
	While Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra was present during the hearing, Bhaichung was represented his lawyer Ushanath Banerjee.         
	According to sources, Sharans attempts to settle the matter amicably failed to break the ice as neither of the two parties was ready to budge from its postition.         
	Mohun Bagan, on their part, said they were ready for a settlement if Bhaichung agreed to don their jersey this season. The proposal was rejected.         
	Sources also revealed that Mohun Bagan wanted the meeting to be treated as reconciliation instead of arbitration.         
	It would leave the Mohun Bagan officials with an option to go to the court of law if the result of the arbitration fails to satisfy them, said a club official.         
	The arbitrator is believed to have told the warring groups that he would take his own decision if his offer for an amicable settlement was not accepted.         
	There is a definite chance of Bhaichung receiving an interim relief, which would make him available for the I-League.         
	The Mohun Bagan secretary said: We will hold a meeting of the club officials before deciding about our future course of action in this issue.

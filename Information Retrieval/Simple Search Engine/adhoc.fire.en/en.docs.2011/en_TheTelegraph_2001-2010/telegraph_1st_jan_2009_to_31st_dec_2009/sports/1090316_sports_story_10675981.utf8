                                                     Mendis: Not asked to quit
  - SLC chief executive likely to weigh options in the near future       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Duleep Mendis                                 
	Calcutta: Duleep Mendis, the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) chief executive, has denied that hed been asked by the new chairman, one-time teammate Somachandra de Silva, to put in his papers.         
	Thats just not true... The bit about my migrating to Australia is also rubbish, the Colombo-based Mendis told The Telegraph on Sunday evening.         
	Mendis, whose contract with SLC is till December, was commenting on a report in one of the leading newspapers of Sri Lanka.         
	The denial notwithstanding, top sources in Sri Lanka have confirmed that, for whatever reason, Somachandra and Mendis havent been on the best of terms for quite some time.         
	Its quite likely, therefore, that Mendis (a former captain, chief selector and manager) will weigh his options at some point in the near future. He may, on his own, choose to leave.         
	After all, Mendis is aware that Somachandras been hand-picked by no less a person than Sri Lankas President, Mahinda Rajapakse. So, hes bound to be on a strong wicket.         
	That Mendis could get marginalised by the new regime was reported in these columns on Sunday.         
	Mendis, however, has the complete support of the sports minister, Gamini Lokuge, who isnt an insignificant player in matters concerning SLC. Indeed, around three months ago, hed sacked Arjuna Ranatunga, a World Cup-winning captain and a member of Parliament, as chairman.         
	Incidentally, Somachandra (a quality leggie) captained Sri Lanka in two Tests, back in 1982-83, in New Zealand, when Mendis was injured.         
	While the two shared the Sri Lanka dressing room, their relationship outside the team environment obviously didnt grow.

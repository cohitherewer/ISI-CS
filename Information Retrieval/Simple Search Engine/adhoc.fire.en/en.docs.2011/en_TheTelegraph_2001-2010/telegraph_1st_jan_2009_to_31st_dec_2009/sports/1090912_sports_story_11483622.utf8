    - Shield final Odafe returns as bencharifas men brace for tough battle today             ANSHUMAN ROY            Mohun Bagan goalkeeper Shilton Paul during a practice session at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. Picture by Gautam Bose                                 
	Calcutta: Starting the season with a title. Thats what Mohun Bagan and Churchill Brothers will be looking at when they square off in the IFA Shield final at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.         
	While the green and maroon brigades endeavour for a title win has been somewhat blunted by the absence of striker Edeh Chidi, who was given a red card against Chirag United in the semi finals, Churchill have been bolstered by the return of the prolific Okolie Odafe.         
	The Nigerian missed the semi-final against Air India due to a double booking and the Goan teams lack of bite in the attacking third, sans their prolific striker, once again came to the fore.         
	Indeed, Churchill look different when Odafe is in the line-up. The sheer strength and arrogance of this Nigerian makes him the most vaunted frontliner in Indian football.         
	So does this make Churchill Brothers a favourite? Not really. Bagan have enough character and courage to face any adversity, and Karim Becnharifa harped on that at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday.         
	I will be lying if I say Chidi wont be missed. I will be lying if I say Odafe will not be a factor.         
	But then, we have our options. We are in final of the first tournament of the season and the boys are charged up. They know their job and I am confident of a good show on the morrow, said the Moroccan.         
	Bencharifa said that he would like to see supporters turn out in droves on Saturday for that will be the best way to compensate for Chidis loss.         
	Even Jose Ramirez Barreto was counting on the supporterss vocal backing. They will make the difference.         
	Bagans practice session hinted that Suraj Mondal may come in place of Chidi. If that happens then Bagan will go for a 4-4-1-1 formation with Marcos playing just behind the frontman Suraj.         
	Bencharifa may also go for a five-man midfield to stifle down Churchills free-flowing style. And then Subho Kumar may be drafted in with Kulothungan playing as the lone striker.         
	The problem is that neither Kulothungan nor Suraj Mondal revel in the No. 9 slot and prefer to operate on the flanks.         
	It will be interesting to see how they live up to the challenge against the likes of Gourmangi Singh and Rowlsison Rodrigues.         
	Bagans ace in this tournament has been their central defender Deepak Mondal. The India international, wearing the captains band in the absence of Sangram Mukherjee, has once again proved his critics wrong.         
	He has been doing a great job for the team. Amazing dedication, Bencharifa heaped praise on Deepak.         
	Churchill looked upbeat about their chances of having the last laugh.         
	Having been together for the last four seasons, Churchill players know each other like the back of their hands.         
	As their new coach Brazilian Carlos Perreira was saying on Friday: This is a very talented bunch of players. I am expecting a good show from them.         
	During his stay with East Bengal and Mohun Bagan, Carlos showed his liking to play attacking football. You ask him and he tells you: Thats what I have been doing for the last 36 years.         
	To bring more thrust upfront, Carlos may play R Vashum upfront along side Odafe and bring in Naveen Kumar as the right half.         
	The Churchill camp, though, refused to believe that Chidis absence gives them an advantage. No way they still have some good players in Marcos, James Singh and Snehasish Chakraborty, he said.         
	Lastly there is always a chance of the match going to the tie-breaker. But Churchill goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya doesnt see that. The match will be decided in the 90 minutes. Whoever wins will win in regulation time, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Baba Khatri, one of Nepals best referees, will be reaching the town on Saturday morning to officiate the final.         
	Bagan had earlier threatened to pull out of the final citing poor standard of refereeing.

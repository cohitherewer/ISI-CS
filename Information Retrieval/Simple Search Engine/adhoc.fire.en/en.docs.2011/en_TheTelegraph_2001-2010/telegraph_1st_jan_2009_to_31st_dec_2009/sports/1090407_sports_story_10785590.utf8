The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fleming to wait and watch
                                                   Fleming to wait and watch
                      
	Chennai: Former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming said John Buchanans multiple-captain theory looked complicated but added that he would prefer to wait and watch what came out of the idea.         
	It sounds complicated. John thinks about a lot of challenges that the game throws out. I will wait and see what happens, said the Chennai Super Kings coach-cum-player, before the teams departure to South Africa for the second edition of the Indian Premier League.         
	It is certainly not something that I want to try I firmly believe that the captain makes the decisions on the ground. I am interested to wait just to see how he decides and what explodes out of it, he added.         
	Kolkata Knight Riders coach Buchanan has floated the multiple-captain concept for his team for the second season of the IPL, which has evoked mixed reactions in the cricketing world.         
	The former New Zealand southpaw spoke highly of the Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	To me our captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is the best. He is fantastic. He has proved himself as a captain by leading the Indian side. I have been lucky enough to witness him in New Zealand in the ongoing series. He is a hundred per cent leader.         
	He is fantastic both with the bat and the gloves and that fact is not talked about enough, Fleming said. (PTI)

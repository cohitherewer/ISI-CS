	Seville: It was supposed to be all about Aston Villa but sadly it ended up being all about David Villa. Englands starting strike-force of Gabby Agbonlahor and Emile Heskey toiled hard but the real finishing touch was supplied by Villa, Valencias finest, who took his first-half goal in stunning fashion, demonstrating a guile in attack of which the visitors could only dream. England were outclassed, the 2-0 scoreline of mere academic interest in a game in which Capellos boys were given a lesson in ball-possession.         
	Just as Villa eclipsed Agbonlahor and Heskey, rapier proving more effective than broadsword, so Spains midfield were almost embarrassingly superior to their counterparts in white. Xavi ran the show, Barcelonas little wizard working triangles around the bemused pair of Michael Carrick and Gareth Barry, and even lifting in a late free-kick that Fernando Llorente headed powerfully home.         
	On the high road and low road, England were overtaken with ease by Xavi and his cultured company, who have not tasted defeat in 29 games. While Marcos Senna patrolled deep midfield, Xavi was ably assisted by Andres Iniesta and Xabi Alonso. Superficially, Spain lacked width in midfield. But the European champions exude threat from all corners and their full-backs, Joan Capdevila and particularly Sergio Ramos, kept raiding forward to provide rich and relentless service from the flanks.         
	This was a chastening evening for the English, placing all the talk in certain quarters of strolling to World Cup glory in its proper perspective. Fabio Capellos England remain a work in progress. Before a crowing Andalusian audience, England were given a lesson in the art of possession by Xavi, in the art of finishing by Villa and Llorente, and in the art of keeping their discipline. Peter Crouch, a half-time replacement for Heskey, kept fouling Senna. David Beckham received a card on his record-equalling 108th appearance, of the yellow variety for dissent. He also caught Gerard Pique and received another present, this time a vindictive riposte from Alvaro Arbeloa which left Beckham crumpled on the mottled turf.         
	Arriving after the break, Beckham matched Bobby Moores outfield record for England and was lauded by the 4,000 supporters who had trekked to Andalusia. He created some promising moments, including a fine pass through the middle which another substitute, Carlton Cole, managed to drag around Pepe Reina but he was then denied on the line by Carlos Marchena.         
	Capello rang the changes at the break, introducing Beckham, Matthew Upson, Frank Lampard, Robert Green and Peter Crouch, but the force, and the ball, remained with Spain. Beckham brought some neat touches to the right, including one superb flick, but Spain continued to menace. When Torres glided through the middle it required a vital interception by Upson to rescue England.         
	Spains fans were loving it, and some even sought to taunt the English further by unveiling a long banner declaring Gibraltar Espanol. England were certainly caught between a rock and a hard place.         
	Llorente doubled their pain, exposing England in the air just as Villa had punished them on the ground. Carlton Cole was then denied, but an England goal would have been an affront. Spain were simply too good for England.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

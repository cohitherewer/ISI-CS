	New Delhi: With the Asian Cup final rounds in Doha just 13 months away, India are planning to test their skills against the top grade teams in the continent. If everything goes right, Bob Houghtons men are likely to take on Asian champions Iraq in a friendly encounter at the Ambedkar Stadium here on December 12.

	Apart from Iraq, two other top teams  Australia and Thailand  were asked by the AIFF to come to India . While Australia said they were keen to host India, Thailand promised to play a friendly next February.         
	The national camp that started in Goa in Tuesday with all the footballers undergoing medical tests, will continue till the friendly match is played on December 12. The players will be released after that.         
	Meanwhile the AIFF has written to Dempo Sports Club asking them to release defenders Samir Naik and Mahesh Gawli for the camp immediately.

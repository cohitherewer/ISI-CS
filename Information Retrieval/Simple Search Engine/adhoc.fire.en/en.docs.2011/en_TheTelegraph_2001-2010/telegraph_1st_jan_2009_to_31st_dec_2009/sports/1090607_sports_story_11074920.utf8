The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England players face wrath
                                                   England players face wrath
                      
	 London: Englands shocking four-wicket defeat against The Netherlands in the World T20 Championship opener has drawn flak from the British media, who described it as the darkest day in the hosts cricket history.         
	The Dutch, who dont even enjoy the status to play one-day Internationals, stunned England with a last-ball victory at Lords on Friday. Never in the error-strewn history of English cricket, never in the rich 195-year history of Lords, has there been a day as dark, wrote one of the leading British newspapers.         
	It has also labelled the loss as a humiliation and compared the most embarrassing defeat in Englands history to a rocking horse winning the Grand National.         
	Collingwood returned to the captains role nine months after he resigned from the one-day position, saying it had a negative effect on his game.               
	 London: England Test and one-day captain Andrew Strauss does not hold his Twenty20 counterpart, Paul Collingwood, responsible for the humiliating loss to the Netherlands in the opening match of the World Cup.         
	After reluctantly accepting the captaincy for the Twenty20 tournament, Collingwood has found himself in the firing line after Fridays four-wicket defeat to a team considered rank outsiders.         
	I dont think you can blame the captain for a defeat like that, Strauss said. The batsmen can hold their hands up and say We didnt get quite enough runs and probably the bowlers and fielders would say We could have done better.               
	 Karachi: Talismanic all-rounder Andrew Flintoffs absence has severely dented Englands prospects and given Pakistan the edge in their crucial group match in the Twenty20 World Championships on Sunday, feels Shoaib Malik. He said Flintoffs absence has neutralised the home advantage that Paul Collingwoods men have.         
	Though England have a slight advantage over us due to home conditions, Flintoffs absence has tilted the balance between the two teams. But obviously England will have tremendous support when they play us on Sunday, Malik said.         
	Malik also played down Pakistans losses to South Africa and India in the warm-up matches and attributed the setbacks to the teams late arrival in England.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Defensive Gayle a rare sight
                                                     Defensive Gayle a rare sight
            Guest Column - Mike Atherton    
	Oh, what a wheeze. A quiet practice day before a low-key Test is usually head-scratching time. What to write? And then Chris Gayle pops up with what must be one of the most unorthodox promotional interviews ever given.         
	Paid by Sky Sports to publicise the second npower Test match at the Riverside, which is in dire need of a lift, Gayle questioned the future of Test cricket, admitted to not wanting the West Indies captaincy and threw a spat with Andrew Strauss, who had criticised his opposite numbers late arrival before Lords, into the mix.         
	Splendid.         
	Gayle on the defensive is a rare sight in cricket, but by lunchtime yesterday (Wednesday), hours after the interview appeared in a national newspaper, he was in full-scale retreat. Echoing Michael Vaughan two years ago, after a similar interview, Gayle claimed that he had been misquoted and misrepresented. There would always be a place for Test cricket, he now felt, and as for the captaincy, well, he had a job to do helping to rebuild West Indies cricket. And Strauss? I dont keep malice with anybody, he said.         
	There will be the temptation in some quarters to squeeze every last ounce of controversy out of this little episode, but that would be distorting. This was an early-morning interview  Gayle is a notoriously late riser  in which some half-baked thoughts were honestly expressed.         
	He is not the only cricketer to prefer one-day cricket and he certainly will not be alone in future in choosing Twenty20 cricket over Tests. It is an open secret that he would not prefer to be captain and if Gayle was irritated by Strausss criticism of his late arrival before last weeks first Test at Lords, he is far too laid-back to bear a grudge.         
	Indeed, as the England captain walked into his press conference yesterday (Wednesday)  clean-shaven, smiling, polite and pukka  it was hard to imagine anybody falling out with him, ever. An ad mans dream. Clever enough, too, to articulate the kind of defence of the longer form of the game that he knew everyone would want to hear before a Test match.         
	I certainly feel that Test cricket is the primary form of the game, he said, with just the merest hint of pomposity.         
	Worthy thoughts these, sincerely held. Strauss and Gayle, though, are chalk and cheddar: the Englishman, foot to the ball and front elbow high, clinging on to national loyalties and a game that has dominated the past; the West Indian, standing and delivering, ready to become a wandering, highly paid mercenary in thrall with a game that will dominate the future.         
	Indeed, the suspicion remains that Gayles enthusiasm for the short form of the game is rather more in tune now with a greater number of players and spectators than Strauss might imagine. Twenty20 has come on board and its made a huge impact on the world, said Gayle, sounding like a man who rather wished he was somewhere else. Its brilliant, games have been sold out and it has taken the place by storm.         
	Certainly, he did not sound like a captain who was ready to provide the kind of leadership his obviously demoralised team need right now. There is no sorrier sight in cricket than watching a team without heart and spine and if West Indies do not show more spirit than they did at Lords, it will be a surprise if Gayle is allowed to decide for himself how long he carries on as captain.

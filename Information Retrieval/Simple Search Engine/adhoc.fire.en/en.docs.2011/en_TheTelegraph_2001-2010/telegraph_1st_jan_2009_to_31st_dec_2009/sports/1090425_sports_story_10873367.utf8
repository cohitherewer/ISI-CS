                                                   Sangram for AIFF award
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi : Mohun Bagan custodian Sangram Mukherjee could be the only player from Calcutta to figure in the list of I-League awardees to be announced on Sunday.         
	While Churchill Brothers footballers are set to sweep the rest of the awards, Mukherjee, who last played for India in 2005, is likely to be the first choice for the best goalkeeper trophy.         
	Three other goalkeepers  Arindam Bhattacharya (Churchill), Subhasis Roy Chowdhury (Mahindra United) and Felix DSouza (Sporting Clube de Goa)  were also in the race for the award.         
	Mukherjee was in top form during Bagans I-League campaign, where the green and maroon brigade conceded just 29 goals.         
	The awards are given on the basis of choices made by the coaches of the I-League teams.         
	The All India Football Federation (AIFF) asks each coach to spell out their first three preferences for five positions  goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, striker and the overall best player  and then select the top finishers for the awards.         
	No coach is allowed to cast their votes in favour of players from their own teams.         
	Apart from Mukherjee, Churchill defender Gourmangi Singh is likely to be named the best defender while his teammate Ogba Kalu leads the race for the best midfielder award.         
	Some of the coaches have also cast their votes in favour of Ishfaq Ahmed of Mohun Bagan.         
	Churchill Brothers Nigerian striker Odafe Okolie, who will receive the Golden Boot for the third consecutive season, is also a frontrunner for two more awards, the best forward and the best player.         
	Odafe, who set a record by scoring 26 goals in the I-League, was a unanimous choice of all the coaches for the best player trophy.         
	The awards will be presented after the Super Cup match between Mohun Bagan and Churchill Brothers to be held in in Gurgaon on Sunday.

                                                     Indians look to seal series
    - Abdomen injury rules tendulkar out of fourth one-dayer today                   Ishant Sharma in Hamilton on Tuesday                           
	Hamilton: India will miss the services of Sachin Tendulkar, as they go into the fourth one-dayer against New Zealand here on Wednesday. The visitors will look to wrap up the series by taking an invincible 3-0 lead.         
	Tendulkar, who has been in superb form, has been ruled out of the match due an abdomen injury but the visitors have the batting might to get past the hosts who have no option but to win the match to stay afloat in the series.         
	The MRI scan done on Indias premier batsman has revealed internal bleeding in his stomach.         
	I had stiffness in the region before the third ODI, but I had stretched myself too far. But I should be ready to play in a couple of days time, Tendulkar said.         
	Considering the momentum the Indians have gained since the debacle in the Twenty20 series, the Black Caps would have to produce something more than their best to stop the marauding visitors at the Seddon Park on Wednesday.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhonis troops have been playing a sort of firebrand cricket, as there is self-belief, confidence and camaraderie.         
	Indian cricket has never been so good, so consistent and so dominating. The results have been remarkably encouraging over the last two years or so.         
	New Zealand would take comfort from the fact that Tendulkar, who smashed a match-winning 163 before he retired hurt at Christchurch, would be rested.         
	However, the return of Ishant Sharma, who should replace Munaf Patel, will lend more thrust to the Indian attack, which seemed to wilt under the early and late New Zealand onslaught in the third ODI at Christchurch.         
	It will be an interesting battle between the highly regarded Indian new ball pair, Ishant and Zaheer, and the Black Caps openers, Brendon McCullum and Jesses Ryder.         
	Ryders wielding of the willow was a revelation as he literally butchered Zaheer, Praveen and Munaf, whose deliveries were dispatched to the pickets with utter contempt.         
	Ryder is the one to watch. While thundering to his maiden ODI hundred (105), the burly left-hander made it loud and clear to bowlers around the globe that he could destroy any attack on his day. But he has to be a lot more consistent to win the respect of the bowling tribe.         
	New Zealand do have a couple of more young batters who could make a mark in international cricket soon. But at this point in time, it is the Indian batting which holds court in the series.         
	Teams         
	India (likely): Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Rohit Sharma, Yusuf Pathan, Praveen Kumar, Harbhajan Singh, Ishant Sharma, Zaheer Khan.         
	New Zealand (likely): Jesse Ryder, Brendon McCullum, Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, Jacob Oram, Peter McGlashan (wk), Grant Elliott, Daniel Vettori, Ewen Thompson, Kyle Mills, Iain Brien.         
	Umpires: Rudi Koertzen, Gary Baxter. TV: Evan Watkin         
	Match starts: 6.30 am (IST).           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Delhi DareDevils release Asif 
                                                   Delhi DareDevils release Asif 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Delhi DareDevils on Monday decided to release Mohammed Asif, following a request from the player, with immediate effect.         
	Due to personal reasons Im having to take this step, and definitely it has not been easy requesting for this as I still have a contract valid for another two seasons, with lucrative financial benefits, Asif said in a statement without elaborating on whether the contract could be revived in future.         
	Asif, who was caught in Dubai on charges of drug possession on his way back to Pakistan after the inaugural Indian Premier League (IPL), had a series of meetings with Delhi DareDevils officials over the past two days following which it was mutually agreed to release the bowler.         
	Currently Im under tremendous amount of pressure at all ends and need to regain my focus after resolving matters by addressing them individually, the bowler said.         
	My only purpose and wish is to play for my nation Pakistan again, and for that I need to disengage from any other cricket engagements, he said.         
	Asifs decision came four days before he is due to appear before the IPL drug tribunal.         
	I have had a wonderful time playing for the Delhi DareDevils and I will continue to follow their progress as also of the players who were my teammates in the Indian Premier League and continue to be my friends hereafter, he added.         
	Delhi Daredevils owners GMR Sports director B. Vanchi said the franchisee respected Asifs wish to prioritise country before club cricket.

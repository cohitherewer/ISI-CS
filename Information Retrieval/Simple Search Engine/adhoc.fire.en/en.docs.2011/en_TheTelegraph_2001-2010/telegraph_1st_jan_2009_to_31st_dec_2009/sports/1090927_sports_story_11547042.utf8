The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hamilton shines in the dark
                                                   Hamilton shines in the dark
                      
	Singapore: World champion Lewis Hamilton put McLaren on pole position for Sundays Singapore Grand Prix after title contender Rubens Barrichello crashed in the dying seconds of Saturdays qualifying.         
	The Briton lapped the floodlit 5.067km Marina Bay street circuit in one minute 47.891 seconds to top the timesheets, with the final session red-flagged with just 26 seconds remaining on the clock.         
	Its absolutely fantastic and I am very happy for the team, Hamilton told reporters. It was his second pole in a row, third in four races and 16th in 49 career starts.         
	Throughout the weekend we have constantly been performing upgrades, so we didnt really know how fast we were. Friday practice didnt go that well so to come here today and do so well is a testament to the team as they worked through the night, he added.         
	Red Bulls Sebastian Vettel and Williams Nico Rosberg, who was quickest in the second part of qualifying, will start second and third respectively after Barrichellos crash prevented either from trying to beat Hamiltons time.         
	Meanwhile, Force India endured a disappointing qualifying as neither Adrian Sutil nor Tonio Liuzzi made the cut.         
	Brawns championship leader Jenson Button, 14 points ahead of team mate Barrichello with four races remaining, qualified 12th. Barrichello, who hit the wall heavily at Turn Five, will start two places ahead of him.         
	The Brazilian qualified fifth but incurred a five place penalty for changing his gearbox after the final free practice session.         
	Hamilton had complained that sections of the track were dangerous prior to Saturdays final free practice but the 24-year-old Briton was all smiles when he addressed the media afterwards.

                                                   Yousuf rockets to No.1
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Pakistan cricketer Mohammed Yousufs return to international cricket just became more amazing.         
	The right-hander, who scored a century in the first innings of the first Test versus Sri Lanka at Galle, zoomed to the top of the International Cricket Council (ICC) rankings for Test batsmen released Wednesday.         
	Yousuf topples his captain Younis Khan to see the top two spots occupied by players belonging to a team that was skittled out for 117 in the second innings against Sri Lanka; conceding the match from a position of strength.         
	Yousuf was at second when his name was taken off the table early in 2009 as Pakistan had not played a Test since before the qualification date for the rankings.         
	Yousuf, who is the only Pakistan batsman to have reached the 900-point mark.         
	This latest update, with another scheduled for after the completion of the first Test of the now-endangered series between hosts West Indies and Bangladesh, has Gautam Gambhir at No.3 as the highest-ranked Indian batsman on the ICC list.         
	Sachin Tendulkar, V.V.S. Laxman and Virender Sehwag, the remaining Team India players in the top-20 were at No.14, No.16 and No.20 respectively.

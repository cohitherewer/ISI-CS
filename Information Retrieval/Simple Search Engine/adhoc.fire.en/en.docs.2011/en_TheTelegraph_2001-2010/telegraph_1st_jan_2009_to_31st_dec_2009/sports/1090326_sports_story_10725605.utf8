            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India wrist spinner Priyanka Roy feels that her best is yet to come. The 21-year-old Bengal cricketer is happy to be chosen in the ICC womens World XI, but believes that she still has a long way to go.         
	For her, the selection in the ICC World XI was totally unexpected. It was a surprise call Totally unexpected I am overjoyed. This will definitely help my career, Priyanka told The Telegraph from Delhi on Wednesday evening.         
	I know I still have a long way to go. I have to work hard and learn many things. I believe its only a start and I am still learning. The best is yet to come, she added.         
	The ICC named Priyanka along with two other Indians, Mithali Raj and Amita Sharma, in the squad.         
	Clearly on top of the world after bagging 12 wickets from seven World Cup matches, Priyanka aims to hone her bowling skills. She emerged as the third best bowler at the World Cup.         
	The World Cup was a great learning experience. I felt that at that level you need to be much more tougher mentally. And that is what I am working on now, Priyanka, who is currently playing at the inter-Railway tournament in Delhi, said.

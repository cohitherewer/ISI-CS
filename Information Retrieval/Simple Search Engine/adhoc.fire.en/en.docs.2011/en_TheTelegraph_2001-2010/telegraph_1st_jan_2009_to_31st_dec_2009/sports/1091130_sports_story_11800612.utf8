The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhupathi,   Knowles part ways
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bhupathi,   Knowles part ways
                            
	London: Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles doubles partnership ended on a disappointing note after the third seeded Indo-Bahamian pair was handed a straight-set defeat by Americans Bob and Mike Bryan in the semi-finals of the ATP World Tour Finals.         
	The Bryan brothers, who are two-time former winners here, won 6-4, 6-4 Saturday night at the O2 arena in London.         
	This was Bhupathi and Knowles final match as partners.         
	In a hugely successful second season together, the Indo-Bahamian duo reached two Grand Slam finals, finishing runners-up at the Australian Open and US Open.         
	Next season will see Bhupathi team up with Max Mirnyi, while Knowles will combine with Mardy Fish of America.         
	With Mirnyi, Bhupathi had won the US Open in 2002. Also, the duo had reached the Wimbledon final the next year.         
	Incidentally, ever since winning the US Open with the Belarussian, Bhupathi has not won a mens doubles Grand Slam title.         
	Im going to spend some time with Mahesh Bhupathi as he and Knowles are not playing together after this tournament.         
	So him and I are going to play some tournaments, though we are not sure which these tournaments are, Mirnyi said.

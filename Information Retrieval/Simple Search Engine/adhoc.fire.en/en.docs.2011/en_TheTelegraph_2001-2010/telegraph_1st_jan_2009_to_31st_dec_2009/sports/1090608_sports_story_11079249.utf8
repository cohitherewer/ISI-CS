	Buenos Aires: Brazil went atop the South American World Cup qualifying group with a commanding 4-0 win in Uruguay on Saturday as previous leaders Paraguay slumped to a 0-2 home defeat by Chile.         
	Bolivia, 6-1 winners at home to Argentina in La Paz two months ago, were brought back to earth with a bump as they lost 0-1 to a youthful Venezuela team in the same stadium at 3,600 metres above sea level.         
	Argentina, meanwhile, were relieved to win 1-0 at home to Colombia and put their campaign back on track.         
	Saturdays results left Brazil, Paraguay, Chile and Argentina as clear favourites to claim the four direct places at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.         
	The fifth-placed team faces the fourth side from Concacaf in a two-leg play off.         
	With five matches each to play, Brazil lead the 10-team group with 24 points, ahead of Paraguay on goal difference. The two sides meet in Recife on Wednesday.         
	Chile are one point behind in third place with Argentina a further point adrift in fourth. Fifth-placed Uruguay are five points behind Diego Maradonas team on 17 and only one ahead of Venezuela, who they visit in Puerto Ordaz on Wednesday.         
	Colombia, eighth with 14, still have an outside hope but Bolivia, ninth with 12, appear to be out of contention. Brazil, who appear to revel when the opposition attacks them, stunned Montevideos Centenario stadium when Daniel Alves scored with a 40-metre shot which was badly misjudged by goalkeeper Sebastian Viera in the 12th minute.         
	Juan headed the second against the run of play before halftime and Luis Fabiano blasted the third into the roof of the net early in the second half, his seventh goal of the qualifiers.         
	Although Luis Fabiano was sent off for a second bookable offence, Kaka won and converted a penalty in the 75th minute to give Brazil their first win in Uruguay since 1976. The hosts had Maximiliano Pereira sent off for a wild lunge at Ramires.         
	The Netherlands became the first European side to qualify for the 2010 World Cup on Saturday and England moved closer to joining them in South Africa as both countries made it six wins out of six.         
	Mark van Bommels early goal clinched a 2-1 victory for the Dutch in Iceland, and Wayne Rooney scored his sixth goal in Englands qualifying campaign in a 4-0 win at Kazakhstan.         
	While Group 6 leader England wont be assured of qualification even if they beat Andorra on Wednesday, the Netherlands are already celebrating winning Group 9 with two games to spare.         
	Norway, bottom in The Netherlands group, remains without a win as they were held to a 0-0 draw in Macedonia. Scotland are second in Group 9 with seven points from five games. Japan became the first side to qualify for a World Cup, booking their spot with a 1-0 win at Uzbekistan on Saturday night. Australia and South Korea too qualified for South Africa 2010 hours later after matches in the Middle East.

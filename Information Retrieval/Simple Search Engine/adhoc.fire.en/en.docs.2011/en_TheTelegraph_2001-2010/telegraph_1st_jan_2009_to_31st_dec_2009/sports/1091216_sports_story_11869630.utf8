The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav: Saha batted better
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sourav: Saha batted better
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly has stepped up whenever Bengal have been in the dumps. Tuesday was no different; the former India captain scored an unbeaten 110 during Bengals final Ranji Trophy encounter against Delhi at the JU (Salt Lake campus) ground.         
	However, the senior most pro in the team was happy to give greater credit to junior colleague Wriddhiman Saha for an unbroken 222-run fifth wicket partnership.         
	Full credit to Wriddhiman for the manner in which he batted. In fact, I feel he batted better than me on the day, Sourav told mediapersons at the end of days play.         
	From anchoring a special quiz show to taking the bowlers to the cleaners, how does he manage to multi-task with such elan?         
	Youve got to remain focused on what you are doing. I still enjoy my game. Its always satisfying to perform for Bengal. It was a difficult situation as we were four down for 43. But the job is still not over. We will have to bat well and put up a good score, Sourav added.         
	Wriddhiman was delighted to hear that someone of Souravs stature had showered accolades on him.         
	When a great player like Sourav says something like this, it cant get bigger. Its always satisfying to get a century. Also the fact that we have recovered well after losing early wickets, the glovesman said.         
	How did Souravs presence help him during the partnership, which has now lasted close to four-and-a-half hours.         
	The best part about Dada is that he always advises juniors to play their natural game. He was constantly talking to and encouraging me. Even when we put on more than 200 runs, he told me to be careful as one mistake could prove costly. It is a batting wicket and the team batting first should score in the region of 500, he added.         
	Was he a little worried that the only specialist batsman still to come was skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla? We have a very able batsman in Laxmi and, Sourasish Lahiri, too, can bat. There is no reason why we cant cross 500.         
	On his personal form, which hasnt exactly been satisfactory, Wriddhiman said: There are times when you dont score big. But one needs to have faith in ones abilities and back ones strengths. This, so far, is my best first-class century. Delhis attack is better than Vidarbha and Hyderabad (teams against whom came the remaining two centuries).         
	Although it is a batting wicket, Wriddhiman was confident that Bengal spinners Iresh Saxena and Sourasish will prove useful.         
	The ball has already started turning. I am confident that Sourasish and Iresh will do well, he signed off.

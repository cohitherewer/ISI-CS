The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pressure pays off, Ram gets entry to Dubai
                                                   Pressure pays off, Ram gets entry to Dubai
                      
	Dubai: The United Arab Emirates (UAE) will allow Israels Andy Ram to play in the mens Dubai Championships next week, the state news agency WAM said on Thursday.         
	A UAE foreign ministry official was quoted as saying that the doubles specialist would be given special permission to take part.         
	This ... does not politically imply any form of normalisation with countries with which the UAE has no diplomatic relations, the official told WAM.         
	Top Israeli player Shahar Peer had to forfeit her place in the womens tournament in Dubai this week after the UAE blocked her visa application.         
	Tournament officials defended the stance, saying local fans would have boycotted the event if an Israeli was allowed to compete and that Peers safety could also have been compromised.         
	The UAE, like most Arab countries, has no diplomatic ties with Israel and routinely denies entry to Israelis.         
	Tensions have been heightened after the three-week Israeli offensive against the Gaza Strip, which killed 1,300 Palestinians and 14 Israelis. Although the conflict ended in January, it caused deep anger around the Arab and Muslim worlds.         
	The refusal to issue a visa to Peer violated WTA Tour rules, which state that any player should be able to compete where she wishes if she has the required ranking.         
	After players, officials, Jewish leaders and even some sponsors condemned the UAE for excluding Peer, pressure mounted on the mens ATP tournament to be cancelled if Ram was also denied entry.         
	If the ban on Israelis had persisted, tennis governing bodies warned future tournaments in Dubai could be scrapped.         
	Before Rams entry was confirmed, WTA chief Larry Scott said: I would be very pleased if as a result of this awful situation some good could possibly come out of it, where there is a revision to the decision of their (UAEs) policy.         
	Ive always believed sport should be separate from politics and political intervention.         
	If that (Ram getting a visa) winds up being the outcome, that would be a very positive thing.         
	The rivalry between Israel and Palestine has always had a negative impact on the relations between the Arab countries and Israel.           (REUTERS)

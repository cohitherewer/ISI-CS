The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Flintoff wanted to keep bowling
                                                   Flintoff wanted to keep bowling
                      
	London: Andrew Flintoff, after his match-winning spell on Monday, said there was no way captain Andrew Strauss was going to get the ball off him.         
	Man-of-the-match Flintoff took five wickets for 92 runs in 27 overs, including three in an unbroken 10-over spell on Sunday for 43 runs as England defeated Australia at Lords after 75 years.         
	Flintoff sent England on their way on Sunday when, with only his fourth ball, he had Brad Haddin taken in the slips by Paul Collingwood. And once that happened, there was no way Strauss was going to stop him. There was no chance! Flintoff said. He would have been on a losing battle there.         
	Before this match, the 31-year-old Flintoff announced he would retire from Test cricket at the end of this Ashes series.         
	But he began the process of bowing out in style, with only the third five-wicket haul of his 77-match Test career and first at Lords.         
	Its been a good Test match and a real team performance, there were some very special performances in this Test, the all-rounder said. Its nice to get five wickets this morning and take the plaudits but it has been a real team effort.         
	Flintoff is now in the elite company of Hedley Verity, the unassuming left-arm spinner from Yorkshire, who was the Man of the Match in Englands 1934 victory.           (AGENCIES)

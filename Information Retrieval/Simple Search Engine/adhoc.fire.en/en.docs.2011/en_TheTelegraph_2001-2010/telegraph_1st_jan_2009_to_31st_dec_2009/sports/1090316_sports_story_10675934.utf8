                                                   Bangla tour in jeopardy
                      
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is gearing up for yet another cancellation as its Bangladesh counterpart has still not confirmed the itinerary for the already shortened and postponed one-day series there.         
	Sources in the PCB said they were not very hopeful of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) getting clearance for the tour from their government.         
	Pakistan were due to tour Bangladesh from March 7 to play five one-day Internationals and two Twenty20 matches. But the tour was postponed by the BCB on government advice. (PTI)

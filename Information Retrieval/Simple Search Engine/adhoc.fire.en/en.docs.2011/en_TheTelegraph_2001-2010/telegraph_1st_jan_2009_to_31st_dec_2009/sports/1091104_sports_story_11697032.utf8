The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Afridi shines in Pak victory
                                                                                                                                     Afridi shines in Pak victory
                  Shahid Afridi in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday                     
	Abu Dhabi: Shahid Afridi smashed 70 off 50 deliveries and took two wickets to lead Pakistan to a 138-run win over New Zealand in Tuesdays first ODI.         
	Afridi put on 101 with Kamran Akmal, who made 67 not out off 43 balls, in less than 15 overs to help Pakistan reach 287 for nine after they lost two wickets for nought at the start of their innings. Khalid Latif too chipped in with 64 from 112 balls.         
	Afridi then returned to become one of four Pakistan bowlers to take two wickets, finishing with two for 46 as New Zealand were dismissed for 149 with more than 10 overs remaining at the neutral venue of Sheikh Zayed Stadium.         
	Aaron Redmond top-scored with 52 for New Zealand, while captain Daniel Vettori made 38.         
	Afridi, vice-captain of the side, was instrumental in initially driving up the run rate with bold hitting. He smashed three sixes and four boundaries in his 30th half-century.         
	He added 101 runs for the fifth wicket with Latif after New Zealand paceman Shane Bond dismissed opener Salman Butt and Younis in his incisive five-over spell.         
	Latif, who scored 19 in his only previous one-day in January last year, was also involved in a 57-run stand for the third wicket with Mohammed Yousuf, who shaped well for his 30 before being run out.         
	Afridi hit Vettori for a six before smashing two off successive deliveries by Nathan McCullum. He hit Bond for a straight drive to reach his half-century off 36 deliveries, his first after 33 matches.         
	Afridis last ODI fifty came against Zimbabwe in Multan last year.         
	Paceman Jacob Oram finally got Afridi off a miscued shot, caught at short fine-leg in the 39th over to break the partnership. Latif followed, bowled by Vettoris vicious arm ball two overs later.         
	Latif hit only two boundaries in his 112-ball knock.         
	Kamrans innings was special as he made full use of the Powerplay, and added 86 off just 37 balls for the seventh wicket with Abdul Razzaq, who made a 20-ball 26.           (AFP)

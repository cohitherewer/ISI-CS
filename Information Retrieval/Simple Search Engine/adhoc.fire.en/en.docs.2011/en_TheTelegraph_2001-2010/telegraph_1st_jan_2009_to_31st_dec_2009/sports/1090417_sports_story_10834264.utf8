The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania goes down fighting to Venus
                                                     Sania goes down fighting to Venus
                              
	Charleston: Second seed Venus Williams needed three sets to beat a gritty Sania Mirza 6-1, 3-6, 6-2 in the second round of the Family Circle Cup on Wednesday (as briefly reported in Thursdays Late City edition).         
	After dominating the opening set, Venus found herself in trouble in the second with the 100th-ranked Indian producing some great defence to save 10 out of 11 break points while breaking the American twice. But Venus finally took control of the match in the third set, dominating Sania to finally move on after a battle lasting almost two hours.         
	Venus will face Sabine Lisicki, seeded 16th, in Thursdays third round match after the German beat Slovakias Lenka Wienerova 6-4, 6-3.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mental fatigue no cause for concern: Dilip
                                                   Mental fatigue no cause for concern: Dilip
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                            
	Mumbai: Former India captain and chairman of selectors Dilip Vengsarkar on Monday disagreed with national coach Gary Kirsten, saying that mental fatigue would not be an issue for the Indian team when they take part in the ICC World T20 championship in England next month.         
	I dont think there is a cause for worry. We have seven days after the finals of the IPL and sufficient time for the players to get that much-needed rest. I hope they dont enter into the studios (for ad shoot) after coming back (from South Africa), Vengsarkar said at a function to unveil the ICC World T20 Championship trophy here.         
	Kirsten had said that the players could be mentally drained after the 39-day extravaganza of the IPLs second edition in South Africa just ahead of the ICC World T20. The tournament begins on June 5, with India playing their first warm-up match, against New Zealand, on June 1.         
	Vengsarkar was confident that India could successfully defend the title they won in the inaugural edition in South Africa two years ago.         
	We were the last team to accept this format. It was difficult choosing the skipper. When we picked Dhoni he hadnt even captained Jharkhand. So we spoke to (Sourav) Ganguly, (Rahul) Dravid and (Sachin) Tendulkar. They said that he had a good cricketing brain. We were slightly apprehensive on how he would handle the team. But after the first match, he was in control of the World Cup, he said.         
	We have more or less the same team that played two years ago. Zaheer (Khan) is in the form of his life, he added.         
	On the referral system, Vengsarkar felt the concept should be scrapped. I agree with Tendulkar on this.. We should get rid of it, he said.         
	He criticised the IPL for introducing a mobile phone contest that involved predicting scores and other live match details, saying the move would hurt the games credibility.         
	Vengsarkar said that he agreed with sports minister M.S. Gill who had slammed the IPLs marketing concept as one that promoted match-fixing. Vengsarkar, however, sought to emphasise that the launch of mobile gaming  which asks the users to predict scores and other details related to a match through messaging  doesnt necessarily lead to corruption in the game.

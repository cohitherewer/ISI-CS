                                                     Bengal mull a few changes
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Lalkamal Bhowmick                           
	Calcutta/Chennai: Bengal are likely to ring in changes against Punjab in their Santosh Trophy quarter final group league match at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on Saturday. Billed as the do-or-die match for the 29-time champions, Bengal need to win to advance to the semi-final stage. The defending champions, though, are in a better position, needing just a draw to extend their stay in Chennai.         
	On Saturday, Bengal are likely to bring in Subhasish Roy Choudhury in place of Abhra Mondal under the bar. Abhras blunder on Thursday allowed Manipur to take home a point. However, Subhasish, too, isnt in good form and it remains to be seen how he performs on Saturday.         
	Upfront, coach Raghu Nandy may bring in Surajit Bose, in place of a profligate Tarif Ahmed. Surajit and PC Lalawmpuiya may pose a few problems for the Punjab defence. Lalawmpuiya is in good form getting two goals in as many matches and much of Bengals hopes rest on this talented Mizo striker.         
	On Saturday, if we can convert half of what we missed in this tournament, we will be through, Raghu said from Chennai. The Bengal coach may give midfielder Lalkamal Bhowmick a start but Denson Devadass knee inury has left him a creased forehead.         
	Punjab, will be missing striker Balwant Singh who will be serving a match-ban for a double booking. In another match, Manipur will lock horns with Tamil Nadu. A point will be enough for Manipur to earn a berth in the last four.         
	Meanwhile, on Friday, Sanath Kumar and Dada Nabeel found the net as Karnataka tamed Maharashtra 2-0 in a Group B quarter final match. Maharashtra who lost their second match, are out of the competition.         
	In another tie, Goa defeated a 10-man Services 1-0, with Climax Lawrence scoring the match-winner. Services goalkeeper Robikanto Singh was shown the red card early in the first half .         
	Karnataka now have four points and need a draw against Services on Sunday to enter semi-finals. Goa, who also have four points, need a point to advance. Services, who have three points, will have to beat Karnataka.

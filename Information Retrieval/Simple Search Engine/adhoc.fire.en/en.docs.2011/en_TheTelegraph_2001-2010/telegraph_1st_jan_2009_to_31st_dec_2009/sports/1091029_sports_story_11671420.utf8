The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Afridi open to Younis return
                                                   Afridi open to Younis return
                      
	Islamabad: Pakistan Twenty20 captain Shahid Afridi says Test captain Younis Khan is more than welcome to make a return to the national T20 team.         
	If he wants to play (T20) he is more than welcome. I will even step down from the captaincy and play under Younis Khan, Afridi said in an interview Wednesday on a television channel.         
	Younis said Tuesday that he might be persuaded to make a comeback to shortest form of the game if his teammates were willing to accepted him in the squad.         
	Younis recently offered to step down as captain of Pakistans Test and one-day teams in protest over match-fixing allegations arising from the Champions Trophy semi-final exit, but he was persuaded to stay on by the Pakistan Cricket Board.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Water fuels Ricky Ponting fire
                                                   Water fuels Ricky Ponting fire
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Australia captain Ricky Ponting, on Friday, accused the groundsmen at the Kotla of hampering their morning practice session by watering the practice pitches.         
	I was disappointed when I had a look at the practice wicket, which was watered this morning, said a livid Australian captain, after the practice session.         
	Everyone in the world knew we were coming for training, except the groundsmen. When we turned up, it was completely unusable. By the time India will arrive, the wicket will be fine, and its a disadvantage for us, Ponting said.         
	The groundsmen at the Kotla, however, said they were not informed that the Australians would come so early. They were supposed to come at 10.15, but showed up at around 9am, said one of the ground staff.         
	When Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was told about the incident, he quipped: One day of practice would not make much of a difference.

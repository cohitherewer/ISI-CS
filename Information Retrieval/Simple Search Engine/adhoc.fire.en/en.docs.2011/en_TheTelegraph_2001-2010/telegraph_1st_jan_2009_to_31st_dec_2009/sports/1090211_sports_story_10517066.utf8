The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arjuna hearing on May 25
                                                     Arjuna hearing on May 25
  - Supreme Court makes exception       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Arjuna Ranatunga                                 
	Calcutta: Unless hes himself removed as the countrys sports minister, Gamini Lokuge will continue to call the shots in Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) till May 25-26, at least.         
	May 25 is when the Supreme Court will begin hearing the fundamental rights application moved by Arjuna Ranatunga, challenging his sacking as SLC chairman by the sports minister.         
	The 1996 World Cup-winning captain was removed in late December, after being in the chair for less than a year. He has sought damages too.         
	Ranatunga, incidentally, is a member of Parliament and a former deputy minister.         
	The hearing is likely to be over in two days and the judgement given soon afterwards. So, till then at least, Lokuge will remain in absolute control of SLC, a well-placed source, based in Colombo, told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Tuesday, the source added: Actually, the Supreme Court has expedited the hearing Normally, such applications arent listed before six months Ranatungas will be heard in four. He has reason to be happy.         
	Ranatunga and the sports minister clashed on a number of occasions and the formers firm (country comes first) stand on the players-for-IPL issue was deftly used by Lokuge to get him out of the SLCs plush headquarters on the Singhalese Sports Club premises.         
	The sports minister is running SLC through his departments secretary, S. Liyanagamage, who has been designated as the competent authority.         
	Decisions of a wholly technical nature are, of course, being taken by chief executive Duleep Mendis, a former captain, chief selector and manager.         
	Mendis, clearly survivor No.1, has been providing much-needed continuity in administration.         
	His presence has ensured that, despite frequent changes at the very top, cricket doesnt suffer.         
	Also that tours get completed without a hitch.

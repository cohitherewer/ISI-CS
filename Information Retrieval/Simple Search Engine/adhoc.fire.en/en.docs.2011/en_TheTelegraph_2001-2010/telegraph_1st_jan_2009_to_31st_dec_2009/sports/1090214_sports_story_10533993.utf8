The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kulkarni gets a call-up
                                                     Kulkarni gets a call-up
    - Fit Harbhajan, Munaf in Karthik makes comeback Jadeja for t20             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni with national selectors (from left) Raja Venkat, chairman Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Surendra Bhave (partly hidden), Yashpal Sharma and Narendra Hirwani in Chennai on Friday. Coach Gary Kirsten did not attend the meeting
  as he is away in South Africa. (PTI)                                   
	Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkars confirmation that he would no longer be available for Twenty20 Internationals, on the eve of Fridays selection committee meeting in Chennai, brought relief and joy.         
	Relief to the selectors (chairman Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Yashpal Sharma, Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave, Raja Venkat); joy for young all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja.         
	Indeed, Sachins announcement allowed the selectors keep Jadeja in the squad for the two Twenty20 matches in New Zealand. He couldnt be retained for the five ODIs, but Srikkanth and Co. have let it be known that he remains on their radar.         
	Had Sachin not gone public, at a promotional in Mumbai, the selectors wouldve picked only two squads  for the Tests and ODIs (Sachin, obviously, is in both) instead of breaking with tradition and choosing 16 for the Twenty20 action too.         
	Sachins confirmation gave Srikkanth and his colleagues a chance to not disappoint Jadeja altogether... He now knows hes in their scheme of things for good and his confidence wont take a beating, a top source told The Telegraph.         
	Jadeja had been impressive on his ODI debut in Sri Lanka just a few days ago. He scored an unbeaten 60. Then, in the one-off Twenty20, hed bowled sensibly. However, with Harbhajan Singh returning and Pragyan Ojha bowling well on the last tour, Jadeja couldnt be accomodated for the upcoming ODIs.         
	Sachin for Jadeja is the only change from the Twenty20 to the ODI squad. The 16 for the three Tests, though, has many changes.         
	Predictably, so.         
	Specialists Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman, Amit Mishra and Murali Vijay are in the squad, as is Lakshmipathy Balaji (in a Test 16 after years) and rookie Dhawal Kulkarni of Mumbai.         
	Kulkarni has been rewarded for an excellent first-class season. That the right-arm medium-pacer is just 20 is a distinct plus.         
	Getting him on board now is a smart investment.         
	Kulkarni is, of course, the fifth specialist medium-pacer in the squad. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, one learns, was pretty firm on having that many new-ball bowlers.         
	For the fifth medium-pacer to be New Zealand-bound, middle-order bat Subramaniam Badrinath had to be dropped.         
	The other change from the last Test squad (which did duty in the home series against England) is that Ojha is out. Besides, Dinesh Karthik has made a comeback. He has been picked as the second keeper and a reserve middle-order batsman.         
	Karthik, in fact, is in all three squads.         
	Bengals Wriddhiman Saha was discussed, but Karthiks far better credentials as a batsman worked in his favour real big. That the selection-cookie could crumble in such a manner had been reported in these columns.         
	Saha will probably continue to be at a disadvantage till he gets to regularly bat at No.3 for his state. That would allow him the best opportunity to script significant innings and catch the eyes of those who matter.         
	Clearly, its time for the Bengal selectors to work in unison with the zonal representative (also from Bengal), Raja Venkat.         
	The injury-prone Munaf Patel has also made it to all squads. He did so after Srikkanth and Co. were shown the post-rehab all-clear from the National Cricket Academy.         
	Munaf, it may be recalled, had come back from Sri Lanka after the first ODI.         
	Former Board secretary Niranjan Shah, meanwhile, will be the manager only during the Twenty20 and ODI series.         
	I cant be away for so long The Board will send somebody else for the Tests, he said.         
	The limited-overs matches are between February 25-March 14, while the Test series is from March 18 to April 7.

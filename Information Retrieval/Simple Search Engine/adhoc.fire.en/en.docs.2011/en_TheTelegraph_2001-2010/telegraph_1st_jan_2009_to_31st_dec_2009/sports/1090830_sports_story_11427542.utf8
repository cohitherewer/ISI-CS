                                                   Batting for soccer
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Its not often that soccer and cricket have a common vein in this country. Well, Pune FC, a club established in 2007 and who have already made it to the elite division of the I-League, have one  Rohan Gavaskar.         
	Rohan is a stakeholder at the club along with the Ashok Piramal group, the corporate house which promotes the club. On the eve of their match against Air India in the IFA Shield, which kicks off on Sunday, coach Derek Pereira praised Rohan, the son of India legend Sunil Gavaskar.         
	If cricketers and Bollywood stars take an interest in soccer, it can only benefit the game. Their image and popularity will help draw fans. So, it will be nice if more such cricketers come forward with an interest in football, he said.

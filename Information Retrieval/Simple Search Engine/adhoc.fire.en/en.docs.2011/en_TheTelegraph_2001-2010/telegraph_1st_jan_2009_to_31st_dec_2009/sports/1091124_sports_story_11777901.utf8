            A STAFF REPORTER            Soumik Chakraborty (centre) and teammates celebrate his goal against Tollygunge Agragami, at the Mohun Bagan ground, on Monday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Chirag United rode under-19 player Soumik Chakrabortys injury-time winner to beat Tollygunge Agragami 1-0 in a CFL Super Division match at the Mohun Bagan ground Monday. This was the second win for Chirag in as many matches.         
	Two minutes into injury time, just when everyone  around 400 spectators  was thinking that Tollygunge would manage to take home a point, disaster struck. Substitute Ayan Dey played it to Joshimar whose effort hit a Tollygunge defender. Chakraborty who was lurking nearby pounced on the rebound and slotted it home much to the delight of the Chirag bench.         
	To be fair, Tollygunge fought tooth and nail and, had it ended even, would have deserved the point. But, then, a momentary lapse of concentration left them despondent and dejected.         
	Chirag looked ordinary on the pitch and, with most of the first team players rested, the reserves did not give coach Subrata Bhattacharya much reason to smile about.         
	Save Basudeb Mondal. Playing his first match since the I-League tie against Vasco, in April, Basudeb once again proved that class is permanent.         
	The half-turns, a flick here and a through pass there showed that the veteran was in full flight. Its just that his teammates were not smart enough to read those.         
	On one occasion, Basudeb freed substitute Gauranga Biswas on the left but the latter lost his balance when he had only the rival keeper to beat. Then, the former India international freed Parveen Kumar on the right but Kumars volley was wayward. Tollygunge, the cradle of many a former star, too, had their moments but failed to capitalise on those.         
	In the seventh minute, Salau Nooruddin picked out Saidul Islam on the right but the latter ran out of ideas in front of the goal.

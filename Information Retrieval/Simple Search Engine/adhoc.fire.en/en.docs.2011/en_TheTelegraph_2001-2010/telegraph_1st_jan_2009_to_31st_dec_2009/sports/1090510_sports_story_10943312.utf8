The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hussey boost for Knights
                                                   Hussey boost for Knights
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders will be looking to bounce back from a string of defeats when they take on the Delhi DareDevils in the Indian Premier League (IPL) in Johannesburg on Sunday.         
	The two teams met for the first time in the competition on Tuesday, and it ended with Brendon McCullum outplayed by the Delhi side.         
	The Knight Riders would have been emboldened by the return of David Hussey after the departure of the explosive Chris Gayle. The Australian middle-order batsman is back after missing the first leg of the tournament on national duty.         
	Hussey is set to take Moises Henriquess place in his first appearance for the Knight Riders this season.         
	The Knight Riders, lying at the bottom of the table, are desperate for that one win which can turn things around.         
	Hussey had done fairly well last season and the side will be hoping he holds the innings together in the crucial middle overs.         
	It is in these middle overs that they have often lost the plot.         
	Anureet Singh had a long bowl at nets on Saturday and it is possible he could come in for Ashok Dinda. Singh was injured during the match against the Mumbai Indians in Port Elizabeth and has since missed quite a few matches.         
	Such has been the DareDevils domination that they can afford to have a bowler of Glenn McGraths stature being reduced to a bench-warmer.         
	A rookie pacer, in Dirk Nannes, has done the job for them and the DareDevils have been more than happy to give him a spot in the playing XI ahead of McGrath.         
	The contrasting form makes the DareDevils an overwhelming favourite Sunday and it would take something extraordinary from the Knight Riders were they to pull off that elusive win.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Two hungry teams promise a thriller
                                                   Two hungry teams promise a thriller
                      
	Cape Town: A thrilling encounter is on the cards with Shane Warnes the Rajasthan Royals challenging win-hungry Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League match here Sunday.         
	The Royals pulled off a win via the Super Over in a nerve-wracking tie against the Kolkata Knight Riders, putting behind their two successive losses to emphasise that they are on the right path to defend their title in the eight-team tournament.                     
	Warne fulfilled the promise to hit back strongly after they had collapsed for the lowest IPL total of 58 runs in their opening match, and their second match was washed away. The Jaipur brigade would now try their best to build on their success and improve the run rate so that they do not slip beyond the first four positions from here on.         
	With all-rounder Yusuf Pathan coming of age and rookie pacer Kamran Khan living up to Warnes expectations, the Royals are not missing the services of Shane Watson and Sohail Tanvir, their heroes during the inaugural edition of the tournament last year.         
	Kings XI Punjab, with just one win in their kitty, would require to be extra cautious as they bump into the Royals, who would again be waiting to surprise the opposition by flinging yet another surprise after baffling the Knight Riders in their previous match.         
	Punjab captain Yuvraj Singh would rely on another stint of apt execution of plan, especially by his bowlers, to tame the Royals. (PTI)

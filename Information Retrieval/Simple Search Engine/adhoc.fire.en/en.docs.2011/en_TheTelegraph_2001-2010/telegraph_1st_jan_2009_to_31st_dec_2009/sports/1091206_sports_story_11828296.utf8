The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chidi wants some relief
                                                                                                                       7                                        Chidi wants some relief
            A STAFF REPORTER            Chidi                           
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan striker Edeh Chidi is tired. Playing day in and day out, the Nigerian is finding it difficult to cope with the pressure. He has already featured in 20 matches of the 21 played by Bagan and is now complaining of fatigue.         
	The only match he missed was against Churchill Brothers in the IFA Shield final following a suspension for a red card against Chirag United.         
	I am tired. I am playing non-stop. I need to take some rest, Chidi Saturday.         
	The Federation Cup is staring later this month and I-League also will start by early January. I need to keep myself afresh for those tournaments.         
	You cant expect me to play every match. I will talk to my coach Karim Bencharifa once he returns from Singapore, Chidi said.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Hockey India (HI) secretary general Mohammed Aslam Tuesday claimed that the newly-formed body has been recognised by the international hockey federation (FIH).         
	In support of his claim, Aslam produced a letter from the secretary general of the FIH, Peter L. Cohen.         
	The letter, which called HI a full member of the FIH, said: You (Hockey India ) have provided FIH with the copy of the constitution of Hockey India and you have provided me with a copy of the certificate of registration.         
	The IOA has also confirmed that Hockey India has been accepted as a member of the IOA and has been registered by the IOA as the sole governing body of hockey, men and women in India..         
	Hence all the formalities required by the FIH Congress for transfer of membership have been fulfilled and I am pleased to confirm that Hockey India is now formally recognised by the FIH

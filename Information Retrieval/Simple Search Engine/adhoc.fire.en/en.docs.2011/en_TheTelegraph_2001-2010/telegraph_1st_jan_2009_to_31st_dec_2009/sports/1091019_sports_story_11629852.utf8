                                                   Football dates in a mess
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: On Tuesday, when the All India Football Federation (AIFF) meets to elect Praful Patel the new president, it would be a rare occasion this season when the federation will stick to its schedule.         
	With at least half a dozen national championships are yet to be held as per the calendar, the federation bosses have decided to advance the annual general meeting by more than two months to felicitate the election of Patel in place of an ailing Priya Ranjan Das Munshi.         
	It has been done as per the constitution of the federation, said an AIFF official.         
	Patel was made the acting president in the last AGM after Das Munshi was taken ill. Our constitution clearly indicates that in this case a full fledged president has to be elected in the next AGM.         
	Since Patel is the only one to file his nomination, he will be elected the president unopposed, the official said.         
	The same official, however, has no clue whatsoever why so many national level tournaments have missed the schedule this season. The most important is the Federation Cup qualifiers. It is unlikely to be played this time.         
	It was originally scheduled for September but no one has talked about it so far.         
	Since Guwahati has already been chosen the venue for the final rounds in December, the smaller teams from different states will have to wait for another season to try their luck in the Federation Cup, an official said.         
	The worst hit is the age group meets. Though the youth development programme (YDP) is said to be AIFFs priority, no one has bothered to keep a check on why tournaments like under-19 I-League, sub-junior Nationals for boys, under-13 Youth Festival for boys or under-19 Nationals for girls have not been held in time.         
	The AIFFs standard excuse is that lack of enthusiasm among the state associations to host these meets is the main reason for the delay. States allege that in several cases, the federation doesnt even bother to intimate them .         
	Tournaments and their status         
	Under-19 I-League (August/Sept.) Yet to be held; Fed Cup qualifiers: (Sept.): Yet to be held; Under-16 National for boys (Sept.): Yet to be held; Under-13 boys festival (Oct.) Yet to start; Under-19 Natl for girls (Oct.) Yet to start; Under-19 National for boys (Nov.) No intimation yet; Under-14 Festival for girls (Nov.) No intimation yet.

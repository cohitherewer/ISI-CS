                                                   IPL revived my career: Watson
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Johannesburg: Man of the final Shane Watson has credited his success to his Indian Premier League (IPL) stint under talismanic Shane Warne. The allrounder, who plays for Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, said the opportunity was the turning point in his career.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On being successful         
	First of all, the thing that I have learnt playing in the bigger games throughout my career is that in the end, it is just another game of cricket. You have got to be in a good place mentally. Previously, I have taken it as more than a game. The thing that stands out for me is the semi-final of the 2007 World Cup against South Africa. I was pumped up to do well but didnt. I was a little bit overawed by the situation. Its part of the learning process how to deal with those situations. Today to be involved in such a great win is one of the better feelings I have had in my career. As Ricky said, it is very very special moment for everyone in the team.         
	Opening the innings         
	I think it is more of my developing as a cricketer. Of course, seeing Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist bat the way they did was obviously a big opportunity for me To try and fill their void was tough because they always got off to fliers, especially in big events Adam in the World Cup final, Matt throughout the whole World Cup showed how good a player he was. I love batting against the new ball and I have that opportunity I have got to do the best that I possibly can.         
	If the IPL played a role in his success         
	Definitely, theres no doubt about that. Thats what got me back on the field. Thats what really got my confidence going as a player. It got me back in the Australian team quicker than I thought it would be. Thats the turning point in my career, to be able to play on such a big stage when I was not even playing for Australia It was a massive opportunity Time to learn a lot through the captaincy and coaching of Shane Warne. It has also helped me to control my emotions. IPL did play a role in my development, no doubt about that. Id been in and out through injuries and it came along at the perfect time of my career. But today was another amazing opportunity as well.

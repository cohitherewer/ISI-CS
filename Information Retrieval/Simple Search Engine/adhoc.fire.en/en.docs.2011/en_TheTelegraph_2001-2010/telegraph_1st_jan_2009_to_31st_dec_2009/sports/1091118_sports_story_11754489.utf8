	Mumbai/ Hyderabad: Medium pacer Vikramjeet Malik scalped six wickets as Himachal Pradesh restricted defending champions Mumbai to a paltry 162 in their Ranji Trophy Super League tie at the MCA ground here on Tuesday.         
	Malik, 26, exploited the seamer friendly conditions to claim six for 33 and rip through the hosts batting line-up.         
	At stumps, on the first day of the Group A encounter, Himachal were 100 for three with Bhavin Thakkar batting on 48 and Vineet Indulkar unbeaten on 10 at the other end.         
	Malik claimed his first three wickets in the space of six balls (in his third and fourth overs), including that of skipper Wasim Jaffer for a two-ball duck.         
	Rohit Sharma made a patient 22, but Mumbai owed it to Ajit Agarkar (45) and Dhawal Kulkarni (28) who put on 53 runs for the ninth wicket to save the hosts from further embarrassment.         
	In Hyderabad, fighting half-centuries by Ambati Rayudu (60) and Syed Quadri (51 not out) helped Hyderabad to reach 175 for five on the opening day of their Group A match against Gujarat.

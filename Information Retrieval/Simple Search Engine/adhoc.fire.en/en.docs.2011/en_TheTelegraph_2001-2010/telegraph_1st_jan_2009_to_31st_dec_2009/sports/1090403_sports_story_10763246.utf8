The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Andy Flower favourite for coachs job
                                                   Andy Flower favourite for coachs job
                      
	St Lucia/Wellington: Results in the West Indies will not count against Andy Flower when the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) comes to decide the new England head coach over the next month. Flower is the frontline candidate, despite his inexperience, to replace Peter Moores and the surprising loss of the Test series in the Caribbean was a potential blot on his application.         
	Hugh Morris, the managing director of England cricket, is here for the deciding one-day international Friday and praised Flower, the batting coach under Moores, for the way he has quietly earned the respect of players and management since taking temporary charge after the drama of the first week of the year.         
	The ECB has drawn up a fairly short shortlist for the revamped job and has laid down detailed specifications to avoid confusion and conflict in the relationship between captain and coach. Flower may face strong competition from South African coach Mickey Arthur and Gary Kirsten, who is pushing India forward.         
	[I am not a candidate, Kirsten, who is in New Zealand was quoted as saying on a cricket website.]         
	John Buchanan and Tom Moody declined invitations to apply, and Graham Ford, the candidate favoured by Pietersen, pulled out last week.           THE TIMES, LONDON AMP; AGENCIES

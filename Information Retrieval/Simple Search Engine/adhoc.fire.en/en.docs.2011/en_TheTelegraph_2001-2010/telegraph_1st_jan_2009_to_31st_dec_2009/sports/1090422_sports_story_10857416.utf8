	When the going gets tough, the tough get going. Chris Gayle and Sourav Ganguly brought back the smiles to the Kolkata Knight Riders camp, defeating the Kings XI Punjab in the rain-curtailed match at Kingsmead on Tuesday.         
	Chasing 159, the Knight Riders were 79 for one in 9.2 overs when rain stopped play. According to the Duckworth-Lewis method they needed 68 at that stage, and thus won by 11 runs. This was the second consecutive defeat for the Preity Zinta co-owned franchise after having been done in by the rain against the Mumbai Indians too.         
	McCullum rightly chose to field on a pitch that, he said, had something in it. His players didnt disappoint, exhibiting a good all-round performance. The bowling was disciplined, the fielding sprightly and the batting adventurous.         
	It seemed the Knight Riders had a spring in their steps and were determined to log full points. They played and stuck to a plan.         
	The Kings XI Punjab batsmen found the going tough but managed to post a decent total, thanks to a late surge from Yuvraj Singh and Mahela Jayawardene.         
	The loss of two wickets at the start could not peg Kings XI back. Karan Goel tried desperately to break free after being bogged down by Ishant Sharma. As he tried to force one through the off side without getting to the pitch, it took the outside edge and Chris Gayle timed his jump to perfection to snap a sharp chance at first slip.                     
	Sourav was not to be left behind and used the opportunity with the ball. Having lost the captaincy and managing just 1 from 12 balls in their opening match against the Deccan Chargers, he looked determined to prove a point. Two wickets in a spectacular first over did subdue the Kings XI batsmen.         
	The former India captain used the moisture on the pitch to trouble the batsmen with lateral movement. Irfan Pathan had just hit 14 in one Ishant over, when his mighty slog was caught neatly, perilously close to the deep mid-wicket boundary.         
	One ball later, Ravi Boparas thin edge went straight to McCullum who was standing up. New man Yuvraj then narrowly survived the last two deliveries.         
	At 48 for three, Kings XI were suddenly looking down the barrel. They moved from 46 for one in six overs to 67 for three in 10 before the rain interruption.         
	It could have been worse had Yashpal Singh, who replaced Ajit Agarkar in the XI, held on to a brilliant diving attempt to dismiss Yuvraj at deep square leg off Laxmi Ratan Shukla. Replays showed Yashpal grounding it with his outstretched left hand as he landed on the turf.         
	The break did upset the momentum. Yuvraj made most of the life adding 56 runs for the fourth wicket with Kumar Sangakkara (26 off 24 balls). Yuvraj was the more flamboyant of the duo, timing the ball to perfection in his 28-ball 38. His knock included three boundaries and two sixes.         
	The return of Sangakkara and Yuvraj in quick succession did put the pressure on Kings XI, but Jayawardenes 31 off 19 balls in the closing stages helped them cross the 150-run mark.         
	Thirty six runs came off 26 balls after Yuvrajs fall, thanks largely to Jayawardene. Ashok Dindas last over cost 16, the maximum off an over in the innings.         
	All that, however, vanished into thin air in the face of some calculated assault by the West Indian captain. Gayles unbeaten 44 came off only 26 deliveries and included two fours and four sixes. Kings XI were made to pay dearly for two dropped chances  on two and 32  as Gayle rode roughshod over the bowling. None of the Kings XI bowlers escaped his lethal charge with Pathan and Vikramjit Malik being the worst sufferers.         
	By the time the dark clouds gathered over Durban, Gayle had truly and surely put it beyond the reach of Yuvrajs men.

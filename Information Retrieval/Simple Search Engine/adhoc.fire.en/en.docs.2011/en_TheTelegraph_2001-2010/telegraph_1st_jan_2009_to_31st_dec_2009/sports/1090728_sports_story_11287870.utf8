The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jenson feels the pressure
                                                     Jenson feels the pressure
    - Our car does not feel the same as it did 3 races ago, says brawn driver                   McLarens Lewis Hamilton with his trophy on Sunday                           
	Budapest: Formula One leader Jenson Button fears he could be like an early pacesetter in the Tour de France who can see his advantage vanishing as the mountains approach.         
	The Briton finished seventh in Sundays Hungarian Grand Prix, his lowest placing this season and the third disappointing result in a row for the Brawn team that dominated the opening races.         
	Red Bulls Mark Webber finished third at the Hungaroring, and set the fastest lap, to go second overall 18.5 points behind Button.         
	Ive lost 15 points to Webber over the last three races and thats massive, said Button, who won six of the first seven races and had hoped for a return to form at the track where he took his first victory in 2006.         
	Its five points a race. Hell be in front of me in four races time. And theres seven left so its for sure not comfortable but I cant do anything about it at the moment, added the Briton.         
	Australian Webber, a cycling hard nut who has ridden some of the more gruelling Tour de France stages for fun in the past, is the rival cast in the role of Alberto Contador, Spains relentless Tour winner.         
	We are leading the championship but its inevitable they are going to overtake us if we keep going like we are, said Button.         
	Its like wearing the yellow jersey knowing that when you get to the mountains you are going to be useless.         
	Webber refused to give his friend any comfort after his fourth podium in a row.         
	We are in the hunt and we can take our car to a lot of venues and be competitive, he said.         
	Button had arrived in Hungary after two cold races in Britain and Germany, with a new aerodynamic package and hoping the hotter temperatures would allow him to work the tyres better.         
	Friday practice was reassuring but he lost out in final qualifying when Brawn kept him in the pits to change a part that had failed on teammate Rubens Barrichellos car and that injured Ferraris Felipe Massa who was hit on the head.         
	Sundays race, won by McLarens Lewis Hamilton in a resurgence for the former frontrunners and second placed Ferrari, then saw a marked dip in the track temperatures.         
	We keep complaining and saying its the weathers fault but it basically is, said Button.         
	Weve got a car that looks after its tyres when its in the right temperature range but as soon as it drops out of that weve got a problem.         
	We cant blame the weather in a way, added Button.         
	Its our fault for building the car the way it is and weve got to work out what we can do to make it work in conditions that dont suit our car so much.         
	Many of the teams at the front have improved their cars but, forgetting them, our car does not feel the same as it did three races ago. So there are lots of areas we need to look at.         
	Button predicted Hungary would not be the only win for a KERS car.         
	The big KERS circuits will be Spa and Monza, he warned, referring to the Belgian Grand Prix in late August and the Italian Grand Prix in mid-September.         
	They are just going to destroy us on those two circuits.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chelsea want it for Guus 
                                                   Chelsea want it for Guus 
                      
	London: Chelsea plan to win the FA Cup as a parting gift for Guus Hiddink, a coach who has brought the same sort of buzz to Stamford Bridge as his predecessor Jose Mourinho, said captain John Terry.         
	Speaking after a training session for the final against Everton, Terry said the London side wanted the Dutch manager to stay but admired his commitment to the Russian national side and wanted to give him the perfect send off.         
	The players love working with a manager whos enthusiastic, who leaves that buzz around the place, who has players on the edge of their seats when they talk, Terry said. Mourinho was very much the same. Well always have a special place for Mourinho and Im sure well have that for Guus as well.         
	Inter Milan coach Mourinho led Chelsea to two Premier League titles, two League Cups, two Champions League semi-finals and an FA Cup before he left after falling out with Russian owner Roman Abramovich in 2007.         
	Hiddink took over last February after the dismissal of Luiz Felipe Scolari with Chelsea in the doldrums and team spirit ebbing. They finished third in the Premier League and came within a whisker of beating Barcelona in the Champions League semis.         
	It would be a lovely way to send the manager off with the FA Cup back at Stamford Bridge, Terry said. You can see our tempo of training for him. We are three days away from being on our holidays and the lads are pushing right through to the end. Hes made some great changes on the pitch but its round the camp as well the way he conducts himself. Hes got total respect.         
	Abramovich struck a deal with the Russian federation to allow Hiddink to steer Chelsea to the end of the season before returning to help the national side. (Reuters)

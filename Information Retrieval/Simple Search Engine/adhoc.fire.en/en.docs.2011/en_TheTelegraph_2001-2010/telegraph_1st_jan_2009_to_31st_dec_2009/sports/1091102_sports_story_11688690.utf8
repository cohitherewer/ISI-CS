The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCA wants T20 tie from 5pm
                                                   PCA wants T20 tie from 5pm
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chandigarh: The Inderjit Singh Bindra-headed Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) will be requesting the Board to schedule the December 12 T20 International in Mohali, against Sri Lanka, from 5.00 pm instead of from three hours later.         
	There will be thick dew if the match is played between 8.00-11.00 pm... It would be best for the T20 International to end around the time it is supposed to start, a PCA official told The Telegraph.         
	A formal communication may be sent as early as Monday.

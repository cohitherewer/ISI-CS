            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Australia and South Africa are vying for the No. 1 spot in Test cricket and the Mace that goes with it, but only one of them will walk away with the prize at the end of the three-match series that starts in Johannesburg Thursday.         
	Australia are currently top of the ladder, a position they have held for almost six years, but a series win for the Proteas would see Smiths side overtake them. A series win for Australia or a draw would see the touring side retain their place at the top.         
	RANKINGS         
	1. Australia; 2. South Africa; 3. India ; 4. Sri Lanka; 5. England; 6. Pakistan; 7. West Indies; 8. New Zealand; 9. Bangladesh 0

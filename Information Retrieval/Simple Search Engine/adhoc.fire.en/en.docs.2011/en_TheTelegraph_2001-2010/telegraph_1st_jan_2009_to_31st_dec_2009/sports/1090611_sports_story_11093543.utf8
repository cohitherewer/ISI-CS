The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies make it tougher for Bahrain
                                                   Aussies make it tougher for Bahrain
                      
	Bangkok: Saudi Arabia and Bahrain spurned their chances of a smoother passage to the World Cup finals on Wednesday after failing to clinch vital away wins against two teams already through to South Africa.         
	Both countries must now contest final matches next week to decide who takes the remaining automatic berth and the two playoff spots.         
	Bahrain lost 0-2 to a weakened Australian team in Sydney, while the Saudis were held to a goalless draw by South Korea in Seoul. Elsewhere, already-qualified Japan secured a 1-1 draw with Qatar in Yokohama, with an own goal after three minutes effectively ending the Gulf sides faint hopes of reaching their first finals.         
	The five teams in contention will now gear up for a thrilling finale on June 17 for the three remaining places.         
	The Saudis are level on 11 points with North Korea, whom they will meet in Riyadh to decide the second automatic place in Group Two.         
	With Japan and Australia already through, Bahrain must avoid a home defeat by Uzbekistan to gain Group Ones playoff place.         
	Australia held their unbeaten record with a second-string team after goals from Mile Sterjovski and David Carney. (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Renault hint at Alonso departure
                                                   Renault hint at Alonso departure
                      
	Singapore: Fernando Alonso said his mind was made up about his future after Renault hinted strongly on Sunday that the double world champion would be leaving the Formula One team.         
	This podium (finish) doesnt change anything, the Spaniard smiled after finishing third in the Singapore GP. I made a decision already... and soon we will know.         
	Alonso won world titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006 and rejoined the team in 2008 after an unhappy one-year spell at McLaren.         
	Renaults temporary managing director Jean-Francois Caubet indicated the driver would not stay with the French manufacturer after the end of the season.         
	Renault will remain his family, Caubet told a French television channel when asked whether Alonso might leave. We will miss him but he will miss us.         
	The Spaniard has been linked to reigning world champions Ferrari for months with his move, as a replacement for Finlands Kimi Raikkonen, considered an open secret in the Formula One paddock.         
	Renault were handed a suspended permanent ban recently. Obviously, now we have had these recent problems, I would like to dedicate my third place to Flavio Briatore, who watched this race at home, Alonso said.

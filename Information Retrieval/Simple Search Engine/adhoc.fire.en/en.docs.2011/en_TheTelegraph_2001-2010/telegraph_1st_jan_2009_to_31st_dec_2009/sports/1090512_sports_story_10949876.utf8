The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anil, Mushtaq inspire Afridi
                                                     Anil, Mushtaq inspire Afridi
                  Shahid Afridi                     
	Islamabad: Pakistan all-rounder Shahid Afridi said that, ahead of the World T20 Cup in England in June, he would be taking inspiration from the performances of Anil Kumble and Mushtaq Ahmed, who had done well in England earlier.         
	The 29-year-old Afridi recently took 10 wickets in five match one-day International series against Australia, to become the highest wicket-taker, from either side, in the series.         
	Indias Kumble and Pakistans Mushtaq had successful stints in English county cricket before quitting the international game.         
	Both of them have taken lots of wickets in England and Ill be looking to take inspiration from them, Afridi said in an ICC newsletter released Monday.         
	Pakistan is in group B of the World T20 Cup with England and the Netherlands. The top two teams from each of the four groups advance to the Super Eight stage. I dont think weve got an easy group, Afridi said. If you remember, we lost to Ireland in the one-day format World Cup 2007. In Twenty20, you cant say anything about any side because its anyones game.         
	Pakistan made a group-stage exit from the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies after losing to Ireland.         
	Afridi, who took 12 wickets at the inaugural World T20 in South Africa two years ago, said his team and defending champions India are the favourites for the title. India beat Pakistan in the 2007 final.         
	I think I will definitely go with Pakistan as favourites, he said. Last time, we played very well in South Africa and I think along with Pakistan, India will also be a favourite.         
	Afridi believes Twenty20 is attracting larger crowds than Tests because of the shorter duration of the format. Twenty20 is a good form of entertainment in cricket for all the people, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India not a bully, says ICC chief
                                                   India not a bully, says ICC chief
                      
	New Delhi: The International Cricket Council (ICC) president, David Morgan Friday said he has never regarded India as a bully. Morgan was responding to remarks by some cricket commentators that financial muscle ensured India always had its way.         
	I have never regarded India as a bully at the ICC, Morgan said. I refer to my experience with India at the ICC under the leadership of Dalmiya, Pawar and now Shashank Manohar. I do not accept that India acts in a bullying fashion, Morgan said. He also sought to dispel fears of an Indian takeover in the ICC when Pawar succeeds him.         
	I have another year in office and have every confidence in Pawar that he would be a good leader when he takes over in a years time, Morgan said.         
	Regarding the controversy over the presence of just three Indian cricketers in the ICC Hall of Fame, the governing body said more Indians would be added to the elite list.         
	The ICC said that the list would be updated annually and would have adequate Indian representation.         
	This is not the final list. I do believe that a number of magnificent Indian cricketers deserve to be in the Hall of Fame. We will soon develop a mechanism and have plans to add more players to the list, Morgan said.

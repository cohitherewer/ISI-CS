	Cape Town: The Fifa have left Diego Maradona in no doubt that he will be thrown out if he attempts to attend Fridays World Cup draw.         
	The Argentina coach has been banned for two months from all football activities although there have been claims that he may try to be part of his countrys delegation in Cape Town for the World Cup 2010 draw which could lead to an embarrassing confrontation.         
	The ban was handed down by Fifa last month following Maradonas obscene remarks to reporters after Argentina reached the World Cup with a 1-0 win over Uruguay.         
	He was punished for using offensive gestures or language and has been banned from football until January 15, 2010.         
	On Wednesday Fifa general secretary Jerome Valcke said: If he is asking for accreditation then there is no way. Maradona has been banned from football activity, not just matches, for two months and the draw is in that period of two months. We have been very clear.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB poised for a contest, after all
                                                   CAB poised for a contest, after all
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB)s annual general meeting on July 31 may see a contest for the vice-presidents post.         
	Abhijit Dutta of Howrah filed his nomination for the vice-presidents post on Thursday, the last day for filing nominations. The CAB has four vice-presidents, and the ruling Jagmohan Dalmiya group has endorsed Shibaji Dutta, Shib Kumar Kalyani, Samar Kar and Timir Ghoshs candidatures.         
	As per the CAB constitution, a candidate can withdraw on the floor of the house.         
	I decided to contest last (Wednesday) night. I feel Timir Ghosh of Murshidabad is not a suitable candidate and I will contest as a mark of protest, said Abhijit.         
	A total 120 of the 121 units submitted their papers for the annual general meeting, with Malda DSA failing to meet the deadline.         
	There, however, seems to be some uncertainty over the representation and voting rights of two clubs  Victoria SC and Balak Sangha.         
	While Victorias executive president Samir Dasgupta has submitted papers, vice-president Ranjit Gupta has challenged his presence in a letter to the CAB. On the other hand, the president and secretary of Balak Sangha, have been locked in a legal tangle.         
	Both the clubs fates will be decided once the scrutiny of papers is complete.         
	Sourav Ganguly, who will represent Mohammedan Sporting Club at the AGM, returned to the city from London on Thursday. He, however, chose not to react. Let me first go and see whats happening the former India captain said on arrival.

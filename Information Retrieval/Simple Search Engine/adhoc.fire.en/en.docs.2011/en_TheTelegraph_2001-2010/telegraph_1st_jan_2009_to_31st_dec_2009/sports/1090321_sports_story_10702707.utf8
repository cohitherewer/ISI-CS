The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ahsan Raza now a VIP in hospital
                                                     Ahsan Raza now a VIP in hospital
    - PCB GOES INTO OVERDRIVE: GETS UMPIRE OUT OF ICU AND RELEASES PAYMENTS           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ahsan Raza                                 
	Calcutta: Much to his familys joy, Ahsan Raza smiled on Friday, a first from him since the March 3 terror strike near the Gaddafi which almost killed him.         
	That was in the afternoon, around 1.00 pm, according to a family member, when the umpire was shifted to one of the VIP rooms at the government-run Services Hospital in Lahore.         
	Till then, Raza was in the ICU, where the conditions (beginning with the airconditioning not working) had been quite awful.         
	Its the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), largely insensitive so far, which took the initiative to get him shifted.         
	Oh, its a relief... Yahan to bahut behtar hai... Rooms such as this are meant for members of the National Assembly or members of the state assemblies... Im feeling good today, Raza told The Telegraph, late in the evening.         
	Speaking on the cellphone of a family member, the 34-year-old father of three girls, added: Its because of Allahs benevolence that Im talking to you... This is my second life... Yeh doosri zindagi hai...         
	Raza, whod been the fourth umpire in the Pakistan-Sri Lanka Test at the Gaddafi, took bullets in his kidney, diaphragm and lungs during the attack which led to eight deaths.         
	It was such an unbelievable security lapse... What Ive learnt is that, among other things, no sharpshooters were deployed on the highrises around the Liberty roundabout (near the Gaddafi) that morning... The story couldve been different if the men had been where they were supposed to be... Perhaps, that was our destiny, Raza pointed out.         
	Asked whether hed be tense the next time he sat in the match officials vehicle, Raza replied: Actually, Ive never been comfortable being driven with escorts and so on... Sab log aap ko dekhne lagte hain... Really, you draw unnecessary attention... Lets see how I feel... Inshallah, Ill soon be available for assignments and, one day, I hope to umpire in India...         
	Recalling those 10-15 minutes of mayhem, Raza said: I think I was the first to shout put your heads down... (Match Referee) Chris Broad was the one closest to me and, when he ducked, I fell on him... After I got hit, it was his turn to try and save me... Chris tried to stop the bleeding... That act probably made a big difference... I cant forget him.         
	Raza is hoping to be discharged by Sunday/Monday.         
	The PCB hasnt announced any compensation as yet, but the umpire informed this paper that the national body would be working out something  apparently, sooner rather than later.         
	Friday, in fact, brought more good news: The PCB released the match-related payments due to Raza. Before the Gaddafi Test, this year, hed been the TV umpire during two Pakistan-Sri Lanka ODIs in January.         
	The family, one understands, received cheques for Rs 2,07,000.

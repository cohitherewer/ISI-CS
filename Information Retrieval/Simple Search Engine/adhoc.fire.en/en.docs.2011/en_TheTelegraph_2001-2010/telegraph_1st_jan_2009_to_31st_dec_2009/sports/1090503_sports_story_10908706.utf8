	We will have an advantage because were playing as a team (and) a lot of these guys are going to be involved in the Twenty20 World Cup, said Clarke, after Australia won the fourth match of a five match-series Friday.         
	Australias victory by eight wickets gave them an unassailable 3-1 lead in the series, with the fifth match to be played here Sunday.         
	Clarke led Australia from the front Friday, scoring an unbeaten 100 as they chased down a modest 198-run target for the loss of only two wickets. Shane Watson struck 85 not out as Australia won their first one-day series since September. Left-arm pacer Doug Bollinger broke the backbone of Pak batting with five wickets for 35.         
	Clarke said the victory augured well for Australias prospects in World Twenty20, to be held in England. If anything, its a positive that were all together at the moment, said Clarke.         
	The right-hander said he was satisfied with the way his players had adapted to conditions in the United Arab Emirates.         
	To play the type of cricket we have, in hot conditions and tough wickets  especially after coming from South Africa, where the conditions were so different  Im impressed with the way weve performed, said Clarke.

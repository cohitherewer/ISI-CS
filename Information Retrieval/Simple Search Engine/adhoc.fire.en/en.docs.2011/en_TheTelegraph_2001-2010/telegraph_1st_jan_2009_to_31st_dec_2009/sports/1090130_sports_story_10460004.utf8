	Mumbai: East Zone batsmen displayed lack of skill and heart as they were skittled out for a paltry 171 on the first day of the Duleep Trophy semi-final against West Zone here Thursday.         
	Put in to bat on a damp and bouncy pitch at the Brabourne Stadium, the visitors blew themselves up  their last seven wickets producing just 35 runs  through some bad shot selection compounded by a tidy spell of left-arm spin bowling by Barodas Rajesh Pawar.         
	Pawar, a Mumbai native, knows the CCI pitch like the back of his hand and exploited the home conditions to return figures of six for 34, his 11th five-wicket haul.         
	Rashmi Ranjan Parida was the lone batsman who kept himself insulated from the madness that gripped the rest of his teammates. The right-hander top scored with 63 and with the support of Saurabh Tiwary, stitched together a 61-run partnership for the fourth wicket that proved to be the only positive phase of the East innings.         
	But even Parida was guilty of playing against the turn of Pawar to be adjudged leg before wicket.         
	At stumps, West had weathered the probing new ball spell of Ranadeb Bose to reach 102 for two with Bhavik Thaker and Cheteshwar Pujara at the crease.         
	Bose scalped rival captain Wasim Jaffer for naught before returning to send back the dangerous Ajinkya Rahane for 23.         
	Twenty-nine-year-old Pawar broke the back of East, who were at one stage decently placed at 136 for three, with a spell that read 7.3-3-22-6.         
	In the course of his devastating spell, Pawar was on a hat-trick after dismissing Saurabh Tiwary and Wriddhiman Saha off successive balls in the 48th over. The diminutive spinner very nearly achieved the rare feat when the fielders went up in an appeal for stumping against Halhadar Das, but the third umpire gave the benefit of doubt to the batsman.         
	Pawar then had Parida and Anand Katti in the space of six balls before adding Ranadeb Bose and Ashok Dinda to his tally. The early damage, however, was done by the seamers.         
	Dhawal Kulkarni removed East skipper Shiv Sundar Das (zero) in the fifth over of the day before Siddarth Trivedi nipped the promising second-wicket stand in the bud between opening batsman Dibyendu Chakraborty and Parida.         
	Then Manoj Tiwary tried to flick Abhishek Nayar on the half-volley and was caught at mid-on.

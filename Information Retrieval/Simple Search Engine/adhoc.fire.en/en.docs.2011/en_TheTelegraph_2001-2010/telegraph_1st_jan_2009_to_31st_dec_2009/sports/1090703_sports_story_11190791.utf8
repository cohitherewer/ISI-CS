                                                   BCCI waiting for the ACA report
  - Chamundeshwaranath issue       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is awaiting a report from the Andhra Cricket Association (ACA) before deciding on Vankenna Chamundeshwaranaths continuation on its very high profile marketing committee.         
	Headed by former BCCI president Sharad Pawar, the committee includes other heavyweights, like Farooq Abdullah and Vijay Mallya, as well.         
	Chamundeshwaranath, whod been the Team India manager during the recent World T20, has been removed by the ACA as its secretary and is at the centre of a state government inquiry.         
	Allegations against Chamundeshwaranath, once a confidant of cricketer-turned-politician Mohammed Azharuddin and a one-time junior national selector, range from financial wrongdoings to harassing women cricketers.         
	Like it or not, theres politics in every association We dont know the truth as yet and, so, a report from the ACA is awaited A number of unsigned letters have been received by us, but we cant act on the basis of the allegations listed in them         
	Chamundeshwaranath has the right to give his side of the story, first within the ACA For now, at least, he remains on the marketing committee, a top BCCI official told The Telegraph.         
	So far, the one formal communication from the ACA has only informed the BCCI that its president, Ganga Raju, had started to function as the secretary too.         
	Chamundeshwaranath, meanwhile, declined to comment on the happenings of the past few weeks.         
	A government inquiry is on and Ive been advised not to say anything till it has been completed, he said on Thursday, when contacted on his cell phone.         
	The buzz is that Chamundeshwaranath is close to the powers-that-be in Congress-run Andhra Pradesh and is trying to convince the state government to take over the ACA.         
	With officials playing dirty instead of promoting cricket, its not surprising that nobody from Andhra has actually made an impact.         
	The M.S.K. Prasads and Venugopal Raos have come and gone.

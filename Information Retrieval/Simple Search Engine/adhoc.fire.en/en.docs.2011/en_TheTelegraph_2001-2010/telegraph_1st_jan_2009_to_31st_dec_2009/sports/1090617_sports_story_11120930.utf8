                                                   Vijender, Nanao loss surprising: Coach
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Indian boxing squad, which finished third in the Asian championships recently, could have done better, said chief coach Gurbax Singh Sandhu.         
	The Dronacharaya awardee, who returned with the team from China on Tuesday, said at least two Indian boxers were unlucky not to have received justice from the judges.         
	India won one gold, two silver and four bronze medals, their best ever showing in the Asian meet in 27 years.         
	Flyweight boxer Suranjoy Singh of Manipur became the first Indian boxer after Rajkumar Sangwan (1994) to win a gold medal in the elite continental championships.         
	The defeats of Vijender Kumar and Thokchom Nanao Singh were surprising, he said.         
	They did not receive justice. Both lost narrowly and the bouts could have gone either way, the coach commented.         
	A smiling Suranjoy Singh said he had first aspired to be a footballer but later changed his mind to take up boxing.         
	My brother Suranjit was an international boxer. He used to go for foreign trips very frequently. Thats the way I got attracted to the sport, the diminutive pugilist admitted.         
	Sandhu said it was only the beginning for the Manipur boxer.         
	He is immensely talented and would go very far in the sport. I am sure this time we will be able to bag medals in the next world championships.

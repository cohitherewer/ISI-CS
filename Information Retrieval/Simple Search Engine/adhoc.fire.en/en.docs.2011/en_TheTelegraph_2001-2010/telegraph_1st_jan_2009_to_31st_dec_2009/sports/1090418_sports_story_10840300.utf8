The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vishy Match Referee on the opening day
                                                     Vishy Match Referee on the opening day
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Gundappa Viswanath                           
	Cape Town: Former India captain and one-time International Cricket Council Match Referee, Gundappa Viswanath, will be in the Referees chair during both matches on Saturday, Day I of the IPLs second edition.         
	Besides doing duty on the opening day, Ill be officiating in nine other matches... Its nice returning to South Africa, where Id been one of the Match Referees during the 2003 World Cup, Vishy told The Telegraph in Dubai on Friday morning.         
	Hed been in transit there.         
	Speaking at the airports dazzling Terminal 3 before boarding a 10-hour flight from Dubai to Cape Town, Vishy had added: T20 is fun to watch and I guess I wouldve enjoyed playing this format... Perhaps, it wouldve allowed me to play all my shots...         
	Vishy started his journey from hometown Bangalore, on Thursday, but had to spend a day in Dubai as a delayed arrival made him miss the Cape Town-connection.         
	I realise there wont be time to get over the jet lag... Ill be starting business almost straightaway, he quipped.         
	Vishy, who has consistently rated Mansur Ali Khan Tiger Pataudi as the finest Indian captain, said he would neither endorse nor condemn John Buchanans multiple leaders concept.         
	Look, I believe one captain has to run the team, but lets see how the Buchanan stuff works... I wouldnt like to pass judgement right now, he pointed out.         
	Brother-in-law Sunil Gavaskar, though, has torn the concept to shreds.

                                                   Borders advice for Tendulkar 
  - He should appear in fewer ODIs       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Former Australia captain Allan Border Thursday said Sachin Tendulkar should play fewer limited-overs matches in order to prolong his Test career.         
	Border, who led Australia to World Cup triumph in 1987, is here as the brand ambassador for the Delhi Half Marathon, to be held Sunday.         
	There is absolutely no doubt that Tendulkar is a great batsman, said Border. I have high regard for him. But it would be better for him to appear in fewer limited-overs matches. It would help him extend his Test career.         
	Representing your country for 20 years in the international arena is not a small achievement. There is always a lot of pressure on an international cricketer and I must say he (Tendulkar) has managed it beautifully, Border said.         
	Like with all other cricketers who have played for a long time, Tendulkars career, too, is marked by injuries and several ups and downs. But what surprises me is that he has managed to retain the same passion for the game he had 20 years ago. He is certainly an amazing cricketer, said Border.         
	Tendulkar is a player who always looks for improvement. It would be very difficult for others to climb to his stature, Border added.         
	Border also praised Mahendra Singh Dhoni saying he was impressed by the India captains leadership qualities.         
	Dhoni is an aggressive captain and has managed to inculcate the same attitude in his teammates. He gets full support from the other players because he leads by example, like in the last match at Nagpur, said Border.         
	Border said the visitors would come back strongly after the defeat in the second one-dayer. India may have gained the momentum after the big win but the Australians are good enough to topple their rivals. I expect a close finish.         
	Border was also quick to point out that Australia were passing through a transition period after the retirement of players like Shane Warne, Adam Gilchrist, Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden. It is always difficult to fill the void, he said. Here, India have the home advantage. They know the environment better.

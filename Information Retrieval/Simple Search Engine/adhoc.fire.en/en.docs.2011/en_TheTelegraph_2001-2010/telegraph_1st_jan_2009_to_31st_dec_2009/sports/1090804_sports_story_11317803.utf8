The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arjuna Awards criteria faulty
                                                     Arjuna Awards criteria faulty
            Free-Kick -P.K Banerjee    
	As I sit down to write this column my mind goes back to the year 1961 when the government instituted the annual Arjuna Awards for outstanding sportspersons. As it turned out, I was the first footballer to receive the award along with legendary players like Ramanathan Krishnan, Salim Durani, Gurcharan Singh Randhawa, Nandu Natekar and others.         
	Later, I learnt that some officials in the football circle had tried to scuttle my chances of landing the honour. However, I received the support of the then national coach S.A. Rahim of Hyderabad. He firmly supported my cause and recommended my name for the award.         
	The other day I read in the newspapers that no footballer has been awarded the Arjuna for the seventh consecutive year. The reports said that when former India captain Syed Nayeemuddin proposed defender Mahesh Gawlis name in the meeting it was shot down by the other members.         
	I dont know how far these reports are true but it is certainly a sad reflection on the way things are managed in our country. I know Gawli from the time he joined the Tata Football Academy, when I had been the director. I have no doubt that he should have received the Arjuna this time.         
	I feel there is something gravely wrong with the criteria set by the government for the awards. One has to win medals at the Olympics, the Asian Games and the world championships or Asian meets to be eligible for the Arjuna. Given the current standard of Indian football, one should not expect our national team to win medals at these tournaments.         
	At the same time, our team has done reasonably well in the last couple of years. Apart from winning the Nehru Cup, the boys did extremely well to qualify for the Asian Cup after 24 years. Since Gawli has been playing for India for nearly 10 years now, he should have been considered for the award.         
	Sadly, the awards in India are sometimes distributed haphazardly and without logic. I am the only Indian footballer till date to have received an award from Fifa but the achievement did not bring me any recognition from the government. Even my employers, Indian Railways, never recognised my contribution to the Railways team, which I served for many years, both as player and a coach.         
	Still, I must admit I was lucky to be the first Indian footballer to receive the Arjuna Award. Six of my colleagues, who were in the immortal 1962 team that won the Asian Games gold medal, also received the award in the following years.         
	But what about those players who created history by winning the countrys first Asian Games football gold medal in 1951? Has anyone ever spared them a thought? I know that Arjuna Awards were not instituted at the time and Sailen Manna, the captain of the team, was later awarded the Padmashree. But his teammates never got the recognition they deserved.         
	I know most of you never had the opportunity to watch the members of the 1951 team in action. Let me assure you that some of them, like Ahmed Khan and Shew Mewalal, could be considered among the all time greats. Now that the ministry of sports has instituted lifetime achievement awards for former sportspersons it is sad that no one from the 1951 team was selected for the award.         
	The Indian team will play the Nehru Cup this month in Delhi. My advice for the players is that they should not feel cheated for not having been given recognition. Let our boys play with renewed vigour to prove their detractors wrong.         
	In the end, I have a word of advice for the national coach Bob Houghton. Please dont waste too much of your energy criticising others. It is always better to focus on the task at hand and make the best of the prevailing conditions.         
	A true professional should always follow this practice.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fica warns ICC of T20 danger
                                                   Fica warns ICC of T20 danger
                      
	Melbourne: Players may be forced to choose Twenty20 leagues over national duties if a healthy balance of optimising commercial revenues and cricketers workload was not struck by the International Cricket Council (ICC), warns the Federation of International Cricketers Association (Fica).         
	Fica chief executive Tim May has asked the ICC to take the matter seriously and rework the Future Tours Programme (FTP), the current version of which will end in 2012.         
	Something must be sorted out or players will be faced to make a decision between representing their country and playing in franchise-type Twenty20 events, May said.           (PTI)

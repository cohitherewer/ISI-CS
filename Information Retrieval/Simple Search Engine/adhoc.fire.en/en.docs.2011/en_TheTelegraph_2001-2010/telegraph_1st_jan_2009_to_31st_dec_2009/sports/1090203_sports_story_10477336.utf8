The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gary keen to wrap it up
                                                   Gary keen to wrap it up
                      
	Colombo: India coach Gary Kirsten on Monday said the team were keen to keep the momentum going after taking a 2-0 lead in the series against Sri Lanka and would look to wrap up the five-match ODI series on Monday.         
	India are up 2-0 in the series and victory in Tuesdays third match will round off things quickly.         
	Yes, it would be nice if we could finish off the series as quickly as possible. We know we have a lot of work to do but the momentum is with us at the moment, Kirsten said.         
	We just have to focus on what we have been doing and give us the best chance of winning the next match, he said at the pre-match press conference.         
	Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni had also said after the second match that the visitors would love to wrap up the series and rest some of the key players.         
	Sri Lanka were found wanting in most departments of the game in the previous two matches but captain Mahela Jayawardene said his side were capable of raising their game.         
	We have been in this situation before. We have to raise our performance.         
	The boys understand the situation, the mistakes they had made, Jayawardene said.         
	We have to be a bit more consistent and play an all-round game.         
	You cant keep making mistakes especially when you are playing against a good team. We know Tuesdays match is very crucial, the Sri Lanka skipper said.         
	Jayawardene said his team needed to put more pressure on the visitors, who are on a roll after winning their last seven one-dayers, and to do that his openers will have to fire in the remaining three matches.         
	Their confidence is pretty high because they have been consistent in the last six months. Thats something probably what we lack. We have to put pressure on them.         
	(Sanath)Jayasuriya and (Tillekeratne) Dilshan are capable of batting according to the situation.         
	Dilshan went for a few shots which did not come off, but he can get a big hundred which he showed in Pakistan. We know the talent they have got, said the skipper.         
	The lack of wickets for Muttiah Muralidharan and Ajantha Mendis  they have combined figures of 40-1-175-3  was not a worry for Jayawardene.         
	The Indian batsmen are not taking chances against our spinners. I think that can work for us because they are not going for too many runs. At the same time if they can pick up one or two wickets I will be very happy.         
	They have been consistent although they are not picking up wickets and they are bowling well. The other bowlers, who have been match-winners for us, are going for a few runs. If they can tighten up a bit more because they know India are taking chances against them they can create opportunities to pick up wickets.

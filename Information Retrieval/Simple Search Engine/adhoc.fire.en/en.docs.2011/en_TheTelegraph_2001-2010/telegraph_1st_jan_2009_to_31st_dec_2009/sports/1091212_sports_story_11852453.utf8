The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Players associations want separate window
                                                                                                                       7                                      Players associations want separate window
                      
	New Delhi: The players associations of South Africa and New Zealand feel that there should be a separate window for the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the Champions League.         
	Yes, there is a need for an IPL and Champions League window, but then they must not expand outside this window. International cricket, the IPL and the Champions League must co-exist and not compete. Players should not be put in a position of having to choose between playing one or the other, Tony Irish, chief executive officer of South African Cricketers Association (SACA), said.         
	Irishs views were backed by New Zealand Cricket Players Association (NZCPA) chief executive officer Heath Mills, who said while creating the window for the Twenty20 tournaments, it should be ensured that international cricket is not devalued.

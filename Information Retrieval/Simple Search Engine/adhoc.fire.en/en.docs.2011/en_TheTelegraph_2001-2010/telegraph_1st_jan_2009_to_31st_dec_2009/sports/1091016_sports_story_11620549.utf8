                                                   Usain Bolt to play cricket
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Usain Bolt will get to show his cricket skills when he joins West Indies stars in a Pro 15/15 tournament in Kingston on Sunday.         
	The worlds fastest man has agreed to play with some of his Caribbean cricket heroes in a 15-over tournament organised by West Indies captain Chris Gayle at Discovery Bay to promote the sport. Cricket is my first love, said Bolt, the Olympic and world 100 and 200-meter champion and record-holder, in a release.         
	I grew up watching cricketers like Courtney Walsh take the West Indies to new heights and I am a big admirer of Chris Gayle for his power batting and calm attitude; he is my favourite player right now. So, to have the chance to play with these guys is a dream come true for me.         
	He will join the likes of West Indies greats Walsh, Richie Richardson and Curtley Ambrose and current stars Gayle, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Jerome Taylor in the four-match, one-day invitation event.

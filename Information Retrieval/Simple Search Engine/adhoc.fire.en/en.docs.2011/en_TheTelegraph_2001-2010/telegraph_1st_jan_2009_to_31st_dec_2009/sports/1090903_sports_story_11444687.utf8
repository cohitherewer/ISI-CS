                                                     Md. Sporting hold Churchill 1-1
            A STAFF REPORTER    
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting held I-League champions Churchill Brothers 1-1 in their IFA Shield encounter at the Mohun Bagan ground on Wednesday.         
	Reisangmi Vashum put Churchill ahead in the 26th minute and Mohammedan Sporting equalised through Dipendu Biswas three minutes later.         
	Having won against Shillongs Lajong FC in their opening match, Mohammedan Sporting now lead their group with four points. Churchill Brothers have to beat Lajong in their last group match and ensure a healthy goal difference for a last-four berth. Lajong are out of the tournament as even a victory wouldnt be enough for them to progress.         
	We could have won... Sheer bad luck, Dipendu said after the match.         
	Churchill coach Carlos Alberto Pereira was disheartened by the outcome. Weve come here with only three weeks of training. These are early days. We didnt play to even 40 per cent of our potential. The defence is our main problem There is no option but to win, said the Brazilian coach.         
	Thankfully, Gourmangi Singh will be available for their next match.         
	After Vashum had given Churchill the lead through a superb volley from inside the penalty area, Dipendu capitalised on a defensive lapse to head home the equaliser. The Churchill defence was caught napping as Peter Odafes centre near the second post found Dipendu scoring unchallenged.         
	The Mohammedan Sporting defence, on the other hand, kept the Churchill forwards at bay with intelligent interception and anticipation. Odafa Okolie was kept quiet by Amrit Pal Singh and that left Churchill struggling.         
	A frustrated Odafa ended up being booked for quarrelling with the referee midway through the second half.         
	The Calcutta giants could have won had Lalchuan Awma and, then, Dipendu not squandered an opportunity in the fag end of the first session. Lalchuan Awmas shot was saved by Lalit Thapa, and then Dipendus volley off the rebound also ricocheted off the goalie.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Irfan: I have been dropped for even a slight dip in form
                                                     Irfan: I have been dropped for even a slight dip in form
  - India discard hopes things will take a turn for the better         A STAFF REPORTER            Irfan and Yusuf Pathan during a promotional in the city on Monday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Irfan Pathan, who was left out of the 15-member India squad for the upcoming tri-series in Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in South Africa, on Monday rued that he has been dropped from the national team whenever there was a slight dip in his form. He added that he would like to raise his performance so that the selectors couldnt touch him.         
	It has been happening with me for the past five-six years. Whenever there has been a slight dip in form, I have been dropped. But thats not an excuse I dont like giving excuses. If I have been dropped, it means that somebody else has done better than me. I want to take my performance to such a level that the selectors cant touch me, Irfan said.         
	Its both, a disappointment and a challenge I will have to take the challenge and come back, he added.         
	At the promotional, which was also attended by Yusuf, a young girl did manage to touch Irfan as she attempted to kiss him. The 24-year-old all-rounder, however, managed to ward her off with alert reflexes.         
	Speaking on brother Yusufs comment a few days back that his omission was because of non-cricketing reasons, Irfan said: First of all, Yusuf didnt say any such thing It was the handiwork of some irresponsible media-person. And I dont think that I was ever dropped for reasons other than cricket.         
	When told that Virender Sehwag has alleged the Delhi and District Cricket Association of interfering in selection matters, the Baroda speedster said: As far as politics in cricket is concerned, well, I dont want to step into that sphere.         
	Asked if the dip in his pace was a worry, he said: Performance is the key Its only when you dont perform that people start asking various questions. I have never been an out and out 140km/hour bowler and my speed has always hovered around the 130km/hour mark. Speed is important, but not to a large extent.         
	Irfan also hoped that things would be better in the future. I have full confidence in myself. Not many people have achieved what I have at such a young age. My performance hasnt been that bad too I did quite well with both bat and bowl in the last IPL. So though I may be a little down now, things are certainly going to be better in the future.         
	Asked if his interest in batting was affecting his bowling, he said: Ive never said that Im a batsman. Im a bowler who wants to contribute with the bat. I dont think batting has affected my bowling. However, if I am given time, I can be an all-rounder.         
	Citing a busy schedule this season, Irfan said he might not able to approach Pakistan great Wasim Akram to help him out. Theres a busy schedule ahead of us. I wont find time to approach him. But whenever he is in India, I would like to seek his advice, he said.         
	Yusuf, on the other hand, said that he often got dismissed trying to score quick runs. I bat at such a position that I have to score quick runs for the team. That brings about my downfall sometimes. But if the team is being benefited, nothing else matters, he said.         
	The brothers selected each other as the toughest opponent on the field. Its debatable though whether thats for brotherhood!

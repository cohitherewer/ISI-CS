                                                   Jeev ends tied 16th
                      
	Dubai: A final round card of three-under 69 was not enough for a top-10 finish but Jeev Milkha Singhs tied 16th position was still the best by an Indian in the Dubai Desert Classic golf tournament here Sunday.         
	Jyoti Randhawa (278) brought home an even-par final round card to finish tied 44th, four shots ahead of S.S.P. Chowrasia who carded two-over 74 that had him tied 57th.         
	Jeev birdied the second hole before dropping his first shot on the third. He bogeyed the 17th as well but squeezed in four birdies in between for an aggregate of 10-under 278. Playing his back nine first, Randhawa was one-under at the turn but eventually the ninth-hole bogey denied him a sub-par card.         
	Chowrasia, another 10th tee starter, was one-under as well after 14 holes before bogeys on the sixth and eighth holes marred his card.         
	Northern Ireland teenager Rory McIlroy (269) carded 67 to win his first professional title by one stroke ahead of Englishman Justin Rose who returned an identical 67 Sunday.

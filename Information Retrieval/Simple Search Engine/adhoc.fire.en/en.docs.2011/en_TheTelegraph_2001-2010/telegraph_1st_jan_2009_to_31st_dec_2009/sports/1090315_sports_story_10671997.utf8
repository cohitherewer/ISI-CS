The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Torres, Gerrard a class apart
                                                     Torres, Gerrard a class apart
                                          
	What a match! A cracker! Did anyone think that a team like Manchester United  invincible at home  will be beaten this badly by Liverpool. The 4-1 victory is in fact Liverpools biggest win at Old Trafford in 73 years! Quite a long time, huh! A fantastic performance from Rafa Benitezs men; Liverpool fans will talk about it even after 73 years!         
	With both the teams coming from convincing wins in the Champions League, I expected them to come hard at each other. And thats how it started. United got an early penalty and went 1-0 up. But then Nemanja Vidic  probably his first mistake of the season  lost the ball to Fernando Torres and the visitors were 1-1. This goal turned the game upside down.         
	Vidic, a very dependable central defender in Alex Fergusons stable, just could not get his act together on Saturday.         
	The mistake had a telling effect on him as he lost possession once again in the second half, this time to Steven Gerrard and was sent off. The resultant free-kick was a goal (Fabio Aurelio) and it was all over for United. A man less and 1-3 down, you can not have a fight-back.         
	So what made this Mission Impossible possible for Liverpool? I think Torres and Gerrard made the difference on the day. Playing 4-4-1-1 in Liverpools scheme of things, Gerrard and Torres act as a perfect foil for each other.         
	Torres in my mind is the best single striker in Europe right now.         
	 He is electric in speed and takes the rival defence head-on. Gerrard, playing just behind the Spaniard, is just out of the world. I see them bringing more glories for Liverpool.         
	Ferguson, according to me, erred in keeping Dimitar Berbatov on the bench. Both Carlos Tevez and Wayne Rooney are very similar in style and they revel only when they have Berbatov alongside.         
	The Bulgarian is strong both in air and the ground and could have posed problems for the Liverpool defence.         
	Two minutes after Ferguson brought him in  in fact, the coach had a triple substitution in the 74th minute  Vidic committed that howler and Berbatov failed to have any effect on the match.         
	The statistics show that Manchester United had more possession, and created more chances. But then in football those things mean nothing.         
	What counts is efficiency and Liverpool had loads of that on Saturday.         
	This win will have a huge impact on the EPL this season. What a performance! Benitez and his boys will never walk alone.

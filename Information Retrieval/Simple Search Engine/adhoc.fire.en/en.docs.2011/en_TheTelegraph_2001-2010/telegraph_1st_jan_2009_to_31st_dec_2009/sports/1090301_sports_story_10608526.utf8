The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | NZ hold India with late strike
                                                   NZ hold India with late strike
                      
	Auckland: The India defence led by captain Sandeep Singh faltered in the dying moments to allow New Zealands Dean Couzins sound the board and have the hosts draw the third and penultimate hockey Test 1-1 here Saturday.         
	With this victory, the Black Sticks kept the series alive, as India go into Sundays decider with a 1-0 lead in the four-match rubber.         
	India started the proceedings on a confident note and dominated the match for the most part of the opening half. However, New Zealand came out rejuvenated after the change of ends and responded well to their coach Shane McLeods call for increased tempo.         
	They earned as many as three penalty corners in the second half against the visitors zero, but every time Indian custodian Bajit Singh came to his sides rescue.         
	Baljit was, as usual, outstanding in front of goal, making several crucial saves, including a strong Richard Petherick drag flick and a cracking reverse follow up shot on the rebound by Simon Child.

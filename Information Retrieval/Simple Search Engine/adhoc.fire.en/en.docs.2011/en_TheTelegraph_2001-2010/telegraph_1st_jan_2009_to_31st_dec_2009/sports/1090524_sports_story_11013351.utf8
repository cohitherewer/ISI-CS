The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No place for Gilchrist in XI
                                                   No place for Gilchrist in XI
    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  As the edition draws to an end, BUCHANAN names his dream team      LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: Adam Gilly Gilchrist has been absolutely mind-blowing in the ongoing edition, but he hasnt made his one-time Australia coach John Buchanans Dream IPL Team.         
	Reason being the Kolkata Knight Riders head of cricket operations, who is never quite away from the headlines, favours a left-right opening combination and has gone for Matthew Hayden and Virender Sehwag.         
	And, yes, Buchanan named one captain  Mahendra Singh Dhoni  not multiple leaders!         
	His selection, exclusively for The Telegraph, is as follows:         
	1. MATTHEW HAYDEN (left-handed bat, Chennai Super Kings): Ive gone for him because hes a left-hander and Id like a left-right opening combination... Hes so dominant at the top of the order and so very consistent... Have preferred him over Chris Gayle.         
	2. VIRENDER SEHWAG (right-handed bat, Delhi DareDevils): Hes very destructive at the top and exceedingly difficult to get out... Plus, he bowls off-spin and could be used for a couple of overs. Its because Ive picked a right-hander at No. 2 that Gilly lost out.         
	3. BRENDON McCULLUM (right-handed bat, Kolkata Knight Riders): Hes an impact player and attacks the bowling... He could also open, with Sehwag then coming at No.3... My Dream Teams reserve wicket-keeper.         
	4. AB de+ VILLIERS (right-handed bat, Delhi DareDevils): Very consistent and has the ability to score whatever the conditions... Can get boundaries at will, almost... Preferred over Rohit Sharma, Jean-Paul Duminy and Ross Taylor.         
	5. SURESH RAINA (left-handed bat, Chennai Super Kings): A left-hander after two right-handers in the middle-order... Is very exciting, with skills on both sides of the wicket... Besides, hes a quality fielder and his off-spin could come in handy... Again, Sharma, Duminy and Taylor lost out.         
	6. RAVINDRA JADEJA (left-handed, Rajasthan Royals): Hes my genuine all-rounder in the XI... Is talented and has been preferred over Andrew Symonds, Tillekaratne Dilshan and Dwayne Bravo.         
	7. MAHENDRA SINGH DHONI (right-handed, Chennai Super Kings): My Dream Teams captain and wicket-keeper... Can bat anywhere in the order and, with his leadership qualities, is an inspirational presence. The ones who lost out are Kumar Sangakkara, Mark Boucher and Dinesh Karthik.         
	8. MUTTIAH MURALIDHARAN (right-handed spinner, Chennai Super Kings): The sole specialist slow bowler... Capable of taking wickets with an excellent economy rate... A strong team man... Have preferred him over Anil Kumble, Shane Warne, Pragyan Ojha and Amit Mishra Kumble was certainly a good option, but Ive decided to go for Murali.         
	9. LASITH MALINGA (right-handed quick, Mumbai Indians): Bowls very well both at the start of the innings and at the end... Clearly, makes an impact.         
	10. DIRK NANNES (left-handed quick, Delhi DareDevils): A forceful type with good pace... Hes been impressive... The likes of Rudra Pratap Singh and Irfan Pathan lost out.         
	11. ISHANT SHARMA (right-handed quick, Kolkata Knight Riders): Hes always learning and lends pace and bounce to the attack... Have picked him ahead of Dale Steyn, Fidel Edwards and Munaf Patel.         
	12th man  BRAD HODGE (right-handed, Kolkata Knight Riders): Can bat at the top of the order, bowls useful off-spin, is an outstanding fielder and has leadership skills as well.         
	Criteria in making the selection: Well, as youve seen, Ive gone for seven batters (including the No.1 keeper and an all-rounder) and four specialist bowlers... All whore capable of impacting big... Most are outstanding fielders too... Fielding is a critical element, particularly in T20 cricket.         
	Finally, his choice to coach the Dream Team: (Laughs) Wouldnt name one!

	Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar cut his cheek and nearly broke his nose after falling on his face in a Johannesburg hotel during the Champions Trophy, Team India manager Anurag Thakur said here Friday.               
	Late on Friday, in a texted reply to The Telegraph, Sachin said: Im better now. Thanx, reports Our Special Correspondent from Johannesburg               
	Tendulkar Friday returned home after Indias doomed Champions Trophy campaign in South Africa and his left eye looked swollen as the star player left the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport.         
	Thakur, who arrived by the same flight, said that Tendulkar had food poisoning on the eve of Indias last league match against the West Indies and he collapsed in his hotel room.         
	He had food poisoning and was possibly dehydrated. He was feeling weak and that was the reason why he felt giddy and hurt himself in the hotel room. But the injury to his cheek is not serious. He is perfectly fine now, Thakur said.         
	Even though Tendulkar did not play against the West Indies, he was present at the ground when India played their last league match last Wednesday, Thakur pointed out.         
	He was present at the ground and hes perfectly fine now. He was not well that day, Thakur said.         
	According to reports, Tendulkar, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Ashish Nehra and Harbhajan Singh had gone to an Indian restaurant in Johannesburg for dinner on Tuesday.         
	When he returned to his hotel room, Tendulkar felt dizzy, lost consciousness and hurt himself when he fell on the table in his room.         
	A cut near his nose and another below his left eye as a result of the fall were indications of the impact of his fall, the reports said.           (AGENCIES)

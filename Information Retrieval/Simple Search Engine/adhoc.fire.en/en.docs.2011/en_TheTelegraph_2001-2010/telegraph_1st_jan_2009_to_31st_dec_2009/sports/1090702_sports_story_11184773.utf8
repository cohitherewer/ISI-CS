                                                   Eden awaits turn as BCCI cites rotation
            OUR CORRESPONDENT AMP; A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Mumbai/Calcutta: The Eden Gardens has once again missed out on hosting a one-day International.         
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Wednesday announced the list of venues for seven one-dayers against Australia after a meeting of the tour programme and fixtures committee at its Cricket Centre in Mumbai.         
	Guwahati, Delhi, Mumbai, Mohali, Hyderabad, Nagpur and Jaipur were named hosts by the BCCI. However, the full itinerary wasnt announced.         
	A BCCI source said the likely dates of the matches were October 25, 28 and 31, and November 2, 5, 8 and 11, but did not divulge the order of the venues.         
	Secretary N. Srinivasan, who chaired the meeting in the absence of committee chairman Lalit Modi, said on Calcuttas exclusion: It is all done by rotation Please remember that a centre gets only one out of 22 matches.         
	Calcutta last hosted a one-dayer way back in February 2007, a washout, between India and Sri Lanka. The last Test to be held at Eden Gardens was between India and Pakistan in November of the same year.         
	The matches, it was learnt, have been slotted according to the new rotation policy adopted by the BCCI, which came into effect from June 2007. The Cricket Association of Bengal was then headed by Prasun Mukherjee, and not Jagmohan Dalmiya, who returned to power last year.         
	Calcuttas turn would come when the Sri Lankans visit India at the end of this year or during South Africas tour early next year.         
	Dalmiya, though, has shot off a letter to the BCCI wanting to know the rationale behind the exclusion.         
	Sources in the BCCI dismissed any ulterior motive.         
	We have a system of rotation which has been arrived at based on the number of matches each of the 22 centres had hosted between 2000-01 and 2008-09.         
	If Mohali or Delhi are getting more matches, they might have lost out on matches earlier. Similarly, Calcutta might have hosted more matches earlier, the source said.         
	It may be noted that the rotation system applies mainly to bilateral series matches and not multilateral tournaments like the Champions Trophy, which India hosted in 2006.         
	The other decisions taken by the committee were:         
	 The Duleep Trophy to be played on a knock-out basis.         
	 The Deodhar Trophy for the 2009-10 season has been scrapped because of a crammed domestic schedule.         
	 Womens cricket to be restricted to one-dayers and T20s.         
	 South Zone to host the inaugural edition of the Boards Corporate tournament between September 1 and 8.         
	 Junior tournaments for the CK Nayudu Trophy (Under-22) and Cooch Behar Trophy (Under-19) to have two tiers  Elite and Plate groups  and to be played on home-and-away basis.

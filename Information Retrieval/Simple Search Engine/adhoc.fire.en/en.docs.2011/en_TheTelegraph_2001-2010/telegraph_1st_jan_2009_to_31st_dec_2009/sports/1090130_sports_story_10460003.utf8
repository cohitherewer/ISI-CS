The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Proteas name a young XI
                                                     Proteas name a young XI
            A STAFF REPORTER AGENCIES            Ponting                           
	Calcutta: South Africa will put their youngest team on the field in a decade when they take on Australia in the final one-day International of their tour at the WACA on Friday.         
	National coach Mickey Arthur on Thursday named a starting line-up in which Herschelle Gibbs and Neil McKenzie are the only experienced players. Even McKenzie has come back into the side after an absence of more than five years. This for a match which would hand the Proteas the No.1 ODI ranking if they win. They had held the top spot briefly during the 2007 World Cup.         
	Arthur dismissed the notion that there was not much at stake for the squad. Every time we go on to the field for South Africa it is an important game that needs to be won. In addition, I cant wait to see how our new caps, Wayne Parnell and Lonwabo Tsotsobe, go. The same applies to Vaughn van Jaarsveld who has only had one game in this series so far, Arthur added.         
	Australia captain Ricky Ponting, talking to reporters on the eve of the fifth and final ODI, said a bit of experience for the youngsters, together with the return of senior players, can bring back Australias aura of invincibility. He termed the last few months as a difficult phase for Australian cricket.         
	With a new generation coming through, and some of our more experienced guys returning from injury, I firmly believe that Australia can regain its aura. A little more experience from the young blokes and a few more senior players returning to the team, such as vice-captain Michael Clarke, can be the difference between success and failure in big matches, he said.         
	It has certainly been a difficult few months... But as I look around the sporting world, there are all sorts of encouraging signs for the future which give me heart that we will soon be consistently back on the winners list again, he added.         
	Teams         
	Australia: Shaun Marsh, David Warner, Ricky Ponting (captain), Michael Clarke, Michael Hussey, David Hussey, Brad Haddin, James Hopes, Mitchell Johnson, Nathan Bracken, Ben Hilfenhaus.         
	South Africa: Hashim Amla, Herschelle Gibbs, Neil McKenzie, A.B. de Villiers, J.P. Duminy, Vaughn van Jaarsveld, Albie Morkel, Johan Botha (captain), Morne Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Lonwabo Tsotsobe.

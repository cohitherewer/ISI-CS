The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Eden Gardens security a hit
                                                                                                                       7                                        Eden Gardens security a hit
            A STAFF REPORTER            Even Sunil Gavaskar had to go through the routine security checks, at the Eden, on Thursday                           
	Calcutta: Cricket crazy Calcuttans may have never found the security arrangements at Eden Gardens as foolproof as it was during the fourth one-day International between India and Sri Lanka, on Thursday.         
	Around 44,000 people, who thronged the ground to watch the match, did not have much of a difficulty entering the venue although security arrangements were beefed up  courtesy a three-tier security check introduced by the police authorities.         
	For the first time in the history of international matches held at the venue, general spectators were first frisked at the starting point of the channelisers, where gate numbers were indicated. The second security check was done at the end of the channelisers. The final security check was done at the entry point. Around 4000 policemen were deployed for this match, which is around 1000 more than the earlier matches played at the Eden. Never has the Eden witnessed so many commandos for an international match.         
	The security arrangements were so tight that even someone like the legendary Sunil Gavaskar and former Sri Lanka cricketer Russel Arnold, both doing commentary for the official broadcasters, had to go through the routine security check. Arnold was held back for a few more minutes than Gavaskar, before the production people took him inside.

	As decided by the police authorities, the Sri Lankan team bus went straight into the stadium and dropped the players right in front of the teams dressing room. However, due to unavoidable circumstances, the same could not be done for the Indian team. Their bus stopped in front of the Club House gate.         
	There were no complaints from the spectators about inadequate water-pouches this time.         
	Biswarup Dey, joint secretary of Cricket Association of Bengal, said: The security part was hassle-free and we are happy that people were able to enter the ground peacefully.         
	Till late in the evening, there were no untoward incidents.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ranatunga is vindicated
                                                     Ranatunga is vindicated
    - SC RULES removal wrongful           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Arjuna Ranatunga                                 
	Calcutta: Details werent available till late on Monday, but the Supreme Court is understood to have upheld Arjuna Ranatungas contention that his removal as Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) chairman had been wrongful.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources in Colombo, Sri Lankas only World Cup-winning captain has been awarded damages, but reinstatement isnt part of the apex courts order.         
	The sports ministry, one learns, will have to pay the damages.         
	Ranatunga (MP and a former deputy minister), it may be recalled, was sacked by sports minister Gamini Lokuge last December. Hed then moved a fundamental rights application before the Supreme Court, on January 22.         
	The application named bete noire Lokuge as the No.1 respondent. Other respondents were sports secretary S. Liyanagama, SLC chief executive Duleep Mendis, junior sports minister Bandura Basnayaka and the countrys attorney-general.         
	Among other things, the application listed instances of favours (unsuccessfully) sought by Lokuge and also cited examples of his interference in SLCs functioning.         
	Thanks to Ranatungas standing and his clean image, the apex court disposed of his application in four months instead of the usual six or even more.         
	He stands vindicated today.         
	Somachandra de Silva, hand-picked by President Mahinda Rajapaksa, is the present chairman of SLC. Incidentally, one of the Ranatunga brothers, Nishantha, is its secretary.         
	Not that Arjuna and Nishantha are on the best of terms, but thats another story.

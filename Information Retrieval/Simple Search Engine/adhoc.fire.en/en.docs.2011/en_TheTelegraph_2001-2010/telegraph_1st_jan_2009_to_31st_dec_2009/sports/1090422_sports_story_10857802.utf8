                                                     Chris rocks as Kings XI roll over
    - Yuvraj second time unlucky after rain brings D-L Method into play           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sourav Ganguly celebrates with teammates the wicket of Ravi Bopara on Tuesday. (AFP)                                 
	Durban: Chris Gayle rocked and the Kings XI Punjab rolled over in crickets rockroll version, giving the Kolkata Knight Riders their first points in IPL 2009.         
	Of course, Tuesday afternoons match was decided on the Duckworth-Lewis Method, with the Knights 11 runs ahead (79 for one in 9.2 overs) of what they shouldve been at the rain-forced stoppage.         
	For the Yuvraj Singh-led Kings XI, it was their second defeat in as many matches via the same Method.         
	Here, theyve only themselves to blame for falling around 20 runs short of what theyd been heading to achieve. Indeed, 158 for six just couldnt have been enough if Gayle and Brendon McCullum got going.         
	They did, especially MoM Gayle (44 not out from 26 balls, 2x4,4x6), who made the most of two let-offs, the first reprieve coming very early.         
	However, the one defining moment featured Sourav Ganguly, sacked as captain two days before this edition got under way.         
	Introduced in the seventh over, with Irfan Pathan firing on all cylinders, Sourav sent back the all-rounder, whod made his India debut under him, and Ravi Bopara, within three deliveries.         
	A smart banner  Dada Jai Ho  surfaced almost on cue. Later, captain McCullum praised his predecessor.         
	One expects a senior player to come and make an impact... I knew the (overcast) conditions would suit Sourav and that he could handle the pressure, McCullum, who confessed to a sense of relief, remarked.         
	Sourav, a partnership-breaker during his days as an India cricketer, returned figures of 4-0-24-2.         
	McCullum, by the way, said that he and Gayle didnt begin the chase with the D-L target in mind. Of course, one had a rough idea... But there was no need to complicate things at the start...         
	Having learnt from the Newlands experience the other day, McCullum didnt choose to bat at Kingsmead.         
	Wed asked ourselves questions over the past couple of days (since Sundays thrashing by the Deccan Chargers) and Im happy the players responded... Yes, getting to winning ways is a relief, McCullum pointed out.         
	The Kings XI Punjab proved to be poor losers, as neither the captain nor coach Tom Moody bothered to turn up at the media conference. Doing so is mandatory.         
	On the eve of the match, Yuvraj had (in a chat with The Telegraph) voiced his concern over the weather and the forecast for rain. His worst fears came true.         
	Despite the hype and the presence of Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta, there were only a few thousand fans at the start. That number didnt swell significantly, even though Durban is packed with those of Indian origin.

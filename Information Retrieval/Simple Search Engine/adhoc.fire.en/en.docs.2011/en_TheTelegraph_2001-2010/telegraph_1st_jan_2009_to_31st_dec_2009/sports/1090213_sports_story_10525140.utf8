                                                   Difficult to play all 3 formats: Ponting
                      
	Melbourne: With Twenty20 adding to the already crammed international schedule, Ricky Ponting feels it is going to be difficult for Australias star cricketers to play in all three forms of the game.         
	The Australia captain is among the handful of Australia cricketers who consistently play Test, one-day and T20 cricket  which currently also includes Brad Haddin, Mike Hussey and Mitchell Johnson.         
	Its going to be difficult (to play all three forms). International cricket has been difficult for the last couple of years anyway, trying to get the right amount of time between games is something that everybody in cricket has been working on and trying to make better, Ponting said.         
	With a tight schedule in place, Australia skipper feels he is going to come across the busiest season ever. This next 12 months will probably be the busiest I have ever played in 13 years, he said.         
	Ponting conveyed his gratitude to the public for their unbelievable support to the fund raising initiative aimed at helping the bushfire victims.         
	The Commonwealth Bank Series Bushfire Appeal has so far raised more than $ 9.6 million to help those affected in Australias biggest natural disaster. (Agencies)

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The West Indies coach John Dyson said that despite the defeat in the Test series, he was expecting competitive performances in the ODI series.         
	This is a totally different game now. We were playing 50-over cricket. The matches were closely fought, we could have won both, said Dyson, in a statement.         
	Dyson also called for pitches which will nullify the Bangladesh spinners.

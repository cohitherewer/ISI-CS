	Mumbai: Mahendra Singh Dhonis fantastic performance for Team India was aptly reflected as he was nominated in the top three categories of the ICC Awards, which were revealed here on Wednesday.         
	Dhoni, who bagged the ODI Player of the Year in 2008, is in the running for a second successive award in that discipline besides being in contention for the Cricketer of the Year and the Test Player of the Year awards as well.         
	India opener Gautam Gambhir and off-spinner Harbhajan Singh received double nominations.         
	Both Gambhir and Harbhajan have been nominated for the Cricketer of the Year and the Test Player of the Year titles.         
	Besides Dhoni, Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh were the other Indians to get nominated for the ODI Player of the Year award.         
	Veteran VVS Laxman made it to the Test Player of the Year nominations.         
	Pacer Zaheer Khan was nominated for the Twenty20 International Performance of the Year.         
	Leg-spinner Amit Mishra bagged a nomination for the Emerging Player of the Year award.         
	Among the women, Mithali Raj and Priyanka Roy were in the line for the Womens Cricketer of the Year award.         
	The awards will be presented on October 1 in Johannesburg, South Africa during the Champions Trophy.         
	The nominations were based on performances from August 13, 2008 to August 24, 2009 and were selected by a five-member selection panel, headed by former West Indies captain Clive Lloyd.         
	The panel also included former India Test captain Anil Kumble, Mudassar Nazar of Pakistan, Bob Taylor of England and New Zealands Stephen Fleming.         
	The awards include eight individual prizes and also features the selection of the Test and ODI Teams of the Year.         
	There will also be an award to the side that has adhered most to the Spirit of Cricket.         
	Besides Dhoni, Sri Lankan Tillekaratne Dilshan has also been nominated in three different categories, while 18 players make appearance in two distinct categories in the sixth edition of the awards.         
	The individual player awards will be selected by an academy of 25 highly respected cricket personalities from around the world.         
	The academy includes a host of former players and respected members of the media and the representatives of the Emirates Elite Panels of ICC Umpires and ICC Match Referees.         
	The nominations for the Womens Cricketer of the Year were decided by a committee of former players, current administrators and journalists.         
	The nominations were announced by Sehwag and former captain Ravi Shastri in the presence of International Cricket Council chief executive Haroon Lorgat.         
	Its good to have awards. Its the Oscar of cricket. When I was young, I used to watch Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar get awards, and used to think I also should get one, Sehwag said.         
	I am hopeful that this year also I can win an award.         
	Its an added incentive for every cricketer to be recognised for his performance and be a part of the World XI like I was last year, Sehwag said.         
	The flashy batsman, who is recovering from a shoulder injury sustained during the May-June IPL in South Africa, hoped he would be fit for the Champions League T20 where he would represent the Delhi DareDevils if fit.         
	Im hoping to be fit for the Champions League, said Sehwag who is to miss the short tour to Sri Lanka for the tri-series starting on September 10 as well as the ICC Champions Trophy.

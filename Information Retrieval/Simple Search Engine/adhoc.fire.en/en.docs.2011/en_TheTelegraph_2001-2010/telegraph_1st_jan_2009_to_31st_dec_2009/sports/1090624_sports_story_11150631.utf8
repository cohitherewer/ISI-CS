                                                   Visa problem for India trio
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Three members of the Indian squad for the four-match ODI series in the Caribbean have had their departure delayed by a hitch in procuring transit visas.         
	Abhishek Nayar, Murali Vijay and S. Badrinath were scheduled to join the rest of the team in the West Indies on Monday, but were still awaiting their UK transit visas on Tuesday.         
	The three of them will leave tonight. Suru Nayak (the BCCIs manager for cricket operations) is in London and is co-ordinating the visa work, a BCCI official said.         
	It means that the earliest the trio would be able to join Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co.  who have already begun their training after reaching Jamaica direct from England following a premature end to their campaign in the World T20  is Wednesday, two days before the first one-dayer at Kingston.         
	The remaining matches are to be played on June 28 (Kingston), July 3 and 5 (Gros Islet).         
	The delay in the departure has left the trio with little time to get accustomed to the conditions in the Caribbean before the opening match. The trio has also not played competitive cricket after the conclusion of the IPL on May 24.

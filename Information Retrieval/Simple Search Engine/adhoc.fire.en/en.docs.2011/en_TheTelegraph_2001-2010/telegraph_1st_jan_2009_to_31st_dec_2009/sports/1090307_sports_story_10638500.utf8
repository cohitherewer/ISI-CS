	Linares: World champion Viswanathan Anand played out his sixth draw on the trot when he signed peace with Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine to slip to joint fourth after the conclusion of the 12th round in the Magistral Ciudad de Linares chess tournament here Friday.         
	With just two rounds to go, Norwegian Magnus Carlsen opened up the tournament with a thumping victory over leader Alexander Grischuk.         
	After the end of the 12th round, Grischuk remains in sole lead on seven points, half a point ahead of Carlsen and Ivanchuk, while Anand, on six points, shares fourth spot with Levon Aronian of Armenia.         
	Anand could not do much even as he changed gears and came back to his first love  the king pawn opening  for the first time in the tournament. Ivanchuk surprised Anand early by going for the Berlin defence and after a theoretical battle, the Ukrainian equalised comfortably.

	Bangkok: The valiant Indian womens hockey team had to be satisfied with the silver medal after they went down 3-5 to formidable China in an action-packed final of the seventh Asia Cup here Sunday.         
	Surinder Kaur and her teammates, who have already booked their berth for the 2010 World Cup in Argentina with this final appearance, tried every trick in the book but just could not get the better of their Chinese opponents.         
	Surinder earned the lead for India in the eighth minute, while Mamta Kharab (47th) and Deepika Thakur (54th) sounded the board in the second half but the Chinese scored thrice in the first session (13th, 18th and 27th) and twice (47th, 51st) in the second to emerge victorious.         
	This was Chinas second Asia Cup triumph, coming exactly 20 years after their 1989 victory in Hong Kong.

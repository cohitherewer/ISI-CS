	Napier: Rain came to Pakistans rescue and robbed New Zealand of a probable victory on the final day of the third Test here Tuesday.         
	According to cricinfo, the hosts needed 118 from a minimum of 23 overs to win the match and the series and BJ Watling was leading the chase with a spirited half-century and no Pakistan bowler looked threatening when the rain came down in Napier to kill the contest.         
	New Zealand were 90 without loss at the end of 19 overs with Tim McIntosh (23n..) and Watling (60n..) at the crease.

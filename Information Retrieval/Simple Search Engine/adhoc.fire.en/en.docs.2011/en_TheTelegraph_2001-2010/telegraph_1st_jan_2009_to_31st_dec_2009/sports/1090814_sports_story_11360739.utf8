The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav: Buchanans a thing of the past, were looking ahead
                                                     Sourav: Buchanans a thing of the past, were looking ahead
    - ICON says he doesnt know whether hell be cordial towards john at next meeting           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sourav Ganguly                                 
	Calcutta: To talk of big off-the-field moments, the one to watch out for will surely be when Sourav Ganguly and John Buchanan come face to face at some point in the future.         
	That would be a first after the Australians removal from the Kolkata Knight Riders and the publication of his latest book, The Future of Cricket: The Rise of T20.         
	A courtesy-oozing crossing of paths, clearly, isnt on the cards.         
	Buchanan, who headed the franchises cricket operations in the first two seasons of the IPL, has been rather negative about Sourav, the Knights icon, in his book.         
	Then, a couple of days ago, he repeated much the same things in an interview to a daily at home.         
	Sourav, for his part, has chosen not to respond to specifics. In a chat with The Telegraphon Thursday, though, he did offer a few biting comments.         
	In fact, even if he didnt set out to, Sourav more than made a point.         
	Buchanan has expressed his opinion I dont wish to react, except to say that Id been the franchises top scorer (349 runs) in the first season Where were concerned, hes a thing of the past Buchanans gone and were looking ahead to the third season, next year, Sourav said.         
	Speaking exclusively to this newspaper last month, Buchanan had (generally) defended the contents of his book. If individuals choose to read those few words as a personal attack, then that is for them to decide.         
	Asked if hed be cordial towards Buchanan at their next meeting, in whichever part of the world, Sourav replied: Dont know I cant tell you right now         
	Sourav, who lost the Knights captaincy in the IPLs second season, earlier this year, is set to be reinstated by principal owner Shah Rukh Khan.         
	By all accounts, only a formal announcement is awaited from the Bollywood badshah.         
	Buchanan, it may be recalled, had been instrumental in removing Sourav (Indias most successful Test captain, by the way) and elevating New Zealander Brendon McCullum.         
	Sourav, meanwhile, declined to spell out the favourite to succeed Buchanan. The buzz, of course, is that John Wright is the clear front-runner.         
	I have a lot of respect for John and hes a fantastic human being Im on the franchises panel which will be interviewing the candidates, but youve got to remember that the decision wont be mine alone, Sourav pointed out.         
	The Knights panel is expected to complete its work by the end of this month.         
	Its well known that Ive worked closely with John, but Ill be okay with whoever is chosen as Buchanans successor, Sourav signed off, heading towards the nets off the indoor centre at the Eden.         
	Sourav and the New Zealander ran a pretty successful partnership, as the Team India captain and coach, respectively, from November 2000 to April 2005. They combined to achieve a success percentage of almost 40 in Tests and 52-plus in ODIs.         
	However, more than the results, Sourav and Wright helped steel the players and made opponents treat the team with much more respect. Thats their legacy.         
	After two poor seasons (finishing third from the bottom and last), the franchise needs exactly that kind of a make-over.

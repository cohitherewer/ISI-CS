The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hansiegate character surfaces at Wanderers
                                                   Hansiegate character surfaces at Wanderers
                      
	Johannesburg: A key figure in the 2000 match-fixing scandal that rocked world cricket, Hamid Banjo Cassim made a sly appearance at the Wanderers to watch an Indian Premier League match before the media forced him into a hasty exit.         
	Cassim, who reportedly introduced the late South African skipper Hansie Cronje to an Indian bookie leading to the infamous Hansiegate episode, walked into the hospitality area of the Wanderers with two ladies in tow, believed to be family members, to watch the match between the Kings XI Punjab and the Deccan Chargers on Sunday.         
	In a white T-shirt, dark trousers and shades, Cassim took his seat and had barely settled down when a journalist recognised him and tried to rekindle his old acquaintance.         
	How are you? he asked the journalist and shook hands with him. With other journalists also identifying him, Banjo, looked less than amused and repeatedly asked them not to pose any questions, insisting he had moved on in life.         
	Im here to watch cricket, thats it, he said.         
	Just not interested in raking up his dubious past, Banjo insisted, I am not talking about something I have been absolved of. And Banjo made it clear this was not his first appearance in the IPL.         
	I have been a regular here and watched many matches of IPL II, he said nonchalantly before going silent. Minutes later, he made a silent exit, just as he had come, leaving the media in a tizzy.         
	Interestingly, playing in the Deccan Chargers jersey was Herschelle Gibbs, another Hansiegate character, who had deposed before the King Commission and admitted taking money from his late skipper for under-performing in an ODI against India in Nagpur. South Africa played five one-dayers in India under Cronje in March 2000. They lost the series 2-3 to India who were playing under the leadership of Sourav Ganguly. Gibbs was a frontline batsman of the South African side in that series.         
	Earlier in the IPL, much was made of the Kolkata Knight Riders player Brad Hodges presence in the hospitality suit with efforts to link it to match fixing. Even though Banjo claimed he has turned over a new leaf, his presence in the hospitality suit created quite a stir, questioning the organisers effort to battle corruption in cricket.         
	Incidentally, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had earlier turned down an offer from the International Cricket Council (ICC) to provide cover from match fixing, apparently because hiring ICCs anti corruption and security unit (ACSU) for the cash-awash league would have cost them nearly $1.2 million.         
	IPL commissioner Lalit Modi, however, assured the organisers have put in place an efficient mechanism to deal with such issues.           (PTI)

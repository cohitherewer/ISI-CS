The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England hope to put it across NZ women
                                                   England hope to put it across NZ women
                      
	London: England would look to continue their supremacy in women-cricket by winning another major title when they clash with New Zealand in the final of the inaugural Womens Twenty20 World Cup Sunday.         
	England, the one-day champions, have hardly put a foot wrong in the ongoing Twenty20 clash and have won all their four encounters with consummate ease. The Black Caps are no pushovers as they too are unconquered so far, winning all their league matches before crushing India in the semi-final.         
	Both the sides have some exciting batswomen and going by their performance so far, another high scoring match is on the cards.         
	The trio of skipper Charlotte Edwards, Sarah and Claire Taylor at the top makes a dangerous England line-up and New Zealand bowlers have to get rid of them quickly if they are to upset the formidable hosts.         
	The awesome threesome share five fifties among them and have done bulk of the scoring for the hosts.         
	Claire has hit two half-centuries in the event with the second and a scintillating one coming against Australia in the semi-final on Friday.         
	New Zealand left-arm seamer Sian Ruck, who has the ability to swing the ball, will have to deliver if New Zealand are to contain the England top-order. For New Zealand a lot depends on the performance of skipper Aimee Watkins, who is in good touch. She has two half-centuries under her belt and has a penchant of making big scores.         
	The left-handed skipper will have to fire one more time to put the hosts under pressure although she has a strong batting line up with Suzie Bates at the top and Nicola Browne and Sara McGlashan in the middle.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Talent has edge
                                                                                                               Talent has edge 
            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Arktouros, Bountiful Talent, Noble View and Safari are the front runners in the nine-horse field vying for the Calcutta 2000 Guineas, the star attraction in Saturdays nine event card.          
	Arktouros and Noble View are yet to show their summer and monsoon season form in their recent starts while Bountiful Talent and Safari have been getting stronger with each outing. More importantly, the two horses have also made their presence felt in earlier classics.           
	Bountiful Talent (B.Prakash-up) and Safari (Suraj Narredu) may, therefore, fight out the Guineas finish. Between the two, Bountiful Talent has been showing his penchant for the middle and the longer distance races and this factor may help the Daniel David-trainee challenge the authority of the 1000 Guineas winner Safari who was no match for the Talent in the 2,000m monsoon Derby.

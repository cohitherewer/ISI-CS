The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Haddin: Pretty easy to get a comment from Buchanan
                                                     Haddin: Pretty easy to get a comment from Buchanan
    - Good combination and consistency make a team tick in T20: Misbah-ul haq             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Misbah-ul Haq and Brad Haddin (below)                                        
	Dubai: John Buchanans advice to the Australia selectors has been greeted with sarcasm by the countrys stand-in T20 captain, Brad Haddin.         
	The other day, Buchanan (who heads the cricket operations of the Kolkata Knight Riders) told an Australian daily that Andrew Hilditch and Co. shouldve been talking to in-form former players like Shane Warne, Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist, getting them to make themselves available for next months World T20.         
	Haddin, Gilchrists successor behind the stumps, snapped: ... Hes entitled to his opinion... Sure looks pretty easy, at this moment, to get a comment out of him.         
	The stand-in captains reaction had been sought by The Telegraph after Thursday nights T20 International at the Dubai Sports Citys Cricket Stadium.         
	Incidentally, the match (UAEs first T20 International) was the last featuring national teams before the World T20, in England.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Suffering a massive seven-wicket defeat         
	I think we were in control for our first five overs, but lost it after that... From then on, we had half a foot on the plane (home)... From then on, we were totally outplayed.         
	Whether its tough focusing on the last day of a tour         
	Shouldnt be... We all knew the itinerary... Knew wed be leaving soon after this match... Cant be an excuse.         
	Australias rather pedestrian record (11 wins, 10 losses) in T20 Internationals         
	Our last few matches (in South Africa, Dubai) havent been great... I find getting to form in T20 quite hard, as you could be playing one or two matches at the end of a tour... I expect the results to be different when the World T20 comes along, for well be focusing on just that once were back home... Any team would benefit from such an exercise... I think our T20 record should be judged after the World T20.         
	Shane Watsons groin injury         
	Its such a disappointment for Shane... He suffered a mild strain while batting and, so, is returning with us (instead of going to South Africa for IPL 2009) for scans... The assessment will be done after the reports are available... We all know Shanes such a class act.         
	Brett Lees comeback, after five months         
	He bowled fast, especially the first ball... If this match is any indication, then hes going to be bowling at a pretty good pace.         
	Shahid Afridis success in the five-match ODI series and the T20 International         
	Obviously, hes done well, but I dont believe weve got a problem facing spin... Throughout, Afridi bowled in the right areas.         
	Matthew Haydens excellent form in the ongoing IPL         
	He served Australia very well and (still) is such a fine player... When one hits a purple patch, its important to keep that form.         
	Buchanans take on the retired players         
	(Grim-faced) Look, Buchanan coached Australia for a long time (late 1999 to early 2007)... Whether I agree with what hes said or I disagree, hes entitled to his opinion... Sure looks pretty easy, at this moment, to get a comment out of him.         
	The following are excerpts from what Pakistans stand-in captain, Misbah-ul Haq said:         
	Many, including Brian Lara, regarding India and Pakistan as favourites for the World T20         
	Back in 2007, during the first edition, nobody had expected Pakistan and India to do well in South African conditions... But, as it turned out, both made the final, which was won by India... Both teams have done well since too... Dono ka bahut achcha chance hai... Inshallah, well do well.         
	Thrashing Australia         
	It has boosted our morale, ahead of the World T20... Its good for our dressing room that we beat one of the best teams.         
	What prompted him to field         
	A lot of factors... Dew in the second innings was one... Also, this is a new ground, so nobody has a clear feel of the conditions... I was influenced by the two ODIs (team batting second won on both occasions) last month too... My reading was that its difficult to set a target here.         
	Kamran Akmals fine run         
	Under pressure (two wickets had fallen quickly), he played a terrific innings...         
	Possibility of Akmal regularly being in the top four         
	Thats something to be looked at... Its nice that we have him as an option, especially as (Mohammed Yousuf) Yousufbhai isnt available... Kamran has, in the past, opened.         
	Pakistani players having been able to quickly adapt to T20         
	Thats because we play a lot of T20 back home and the players have learnt to respond to T20 situations...         
	[Pakistans T20 record is excellent  13 wins, three defeats, one tie.]         
	Players from Pakistan having to miss the IPL         
	Yes, the preparations of individuals for the World T20 have been affected, but we arent worried... Once we return home, a T20 programme will be ready, giving the players more exposure before the team leaves for England.         
	What makes a team tick in T20         
	A good combination and consistency... Teams having both are bound to prevail more than teams which lack one or both features... Its because of the combination factor that India, Pakistan and South Africa are able to get good results and be consistent... New Zealand, because of all-rounders, too is good in T20.         
	Safe total in T20         
	(Grins) Probably anything more than 160-170... Chasing that many makes it tough... However, no total is really safe...

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kevin: Im not good at T20
                                                   Kevin: Im not good at T20
                      
	London: The most expensive Indian Premier League (IPL) player and flamboyant England batsman Kevin Pietersen has confessed that he is not good at playing the hugely popular Twenty20 format but vowed to make amends during the World T20 Cup, beginning on June 5.         
	Im not very good at Twenty20 cricket, am I? said Pietersen.         
	The more you play T20 cricket the better you become and I havent played a lot of it, and Im not very good at it, he was quoted as saying in an English newspaper.         
	Pietersen, who was not a part of the inaugural edition of IPL, played only six matches in the second edition in South Africa and has made just one 50 for England in the T20 format, averaging 26.         
	Pietersen disclosed that he had developed new theories to suit his batting to the shortest format of the game.         
	The more I play it, the more Ill catch up with my records in Test and one-day cricket definitely.         
	I just know that I will get much better at it. Ive worked out some new theories about how to go about my batting in T20 and that will make a difference, hopefully starting next week! he said.         
	The 28-year-old ex-England captain, who failed to impress as the Royal Challengers Bangalore captain in IPL, said he loved the experience.         
	I made a great captain, didnt I? Pietersen said on a lighter note.         
	We won two out of six when I was there and then Anil Kumble took over and they got to the final. People are going to take pot shots at me over the IPL and the money I earned in two weeks, but it was such a great experience. I loved it, he said.         
	He sought to explain the reason behind gaffes like not knowing the names of his Royal Challengers team members even at time of toss in IPL.         
	To captain the side four days after arriving and not knowing what some of the guys did and not knowing most of their names made it a huge task for me.         
	I wasnt as focused on my batting as I was on trying to learn the guys names and what they did, he said.         
	It was less than two years ago that Pietersen called Twenty20 a silly game with silly shots but he admits his attitude to the game has since changed. (PTI)

            A STAFF REPORTER                       
	Calcutta: Sreesanth has been ruled out of Saturdays Twenty20 tie against Sri Lanka after testing positive for swine flu.         
	The Team India pacer had been admitted to a private hospital, near Mohali, with swine flu like symptoms Thursday night.         
	Sreesanth was admitted to Fortis Hospital on Thursday at 11.30 pm and was seen by physician Dr Vikas Bhutani prior to admission. Since he had persistent symptoms of cough, fever and body ache, his throat swab was sent for H1N1 testing.         
	The report came Friday evening and was found to be positive. He has been put on Tamiflu medication since, the Punjab Cricket Association joint secretary G.S. Wali said in a statement.         
	He will remain admitted in the hospital for a day or two. He is recovering well and all his vital signs are normal, the release added.         
	Earlier in the day, Fortis Hospital director Dr A.R. Banerjee said Sreesanth was brought with cough, sore throat and fever and samples had been taken for swine flu tests, reports PTI.         
	Sreesanth had also missed the opening Twenty20 against Sri Lanka in Nagpur because of a stomach bug. Bengal speedster Ashok Dinda, who made his debut for the national side, was the one to benefit.         
	Sreesanth returned to international cricket after 19 months in a spectacular fashion by bowling India to an innings victory over the Lankans in the second of the three-Test series in Kanpur. He played in the third and final Test at Mumbais Brabourne Stadium, which India won by an innings and 24 runs to wrap up the series 2-0.         
	The pacer is also unlikely to be available for the first two one-day Internationals in Rajkot and Visakhapatnam on Tuesday and Friday.         
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India is yet to decide on a replacement and a decision is expected to be taken Saturday. Ishant Sharma, who wasnt included in the squad, may get the nod in the circumstances.         
	The Gujarat Cricket Association president, Narendra Modi, was the first from the cricketing fraternity to have contracted swine flu. This was days after he had been introduced to both the Indian and Australian players during the opening ODI of the seven-match series against Australia in Vadodara.         
	Modi had left for Moscow immediately after meeting the teams in Vadodara. Hed been ill since returning home.

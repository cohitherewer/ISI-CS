The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wont forget meeting Sachin, says Hughes
                                                   Wont forget meeting Sachin, says Hughes
                      
	Melbourne: Australian opener Phillip Hughes did not share the details of his meeting with Sachin Tendulkar but said it was one interaction he would never forget.         
	The 20-year-old opener met Tendulkar in a Mumbai hotel earlier this month after his unceremonious axing from the Ashes squad.         
	Back in Australia to join his New South Wales teammates, Hughes did not reveal what he discussed with the Indian batting great but said he would cherish it.         
	I had questions for him, and he had a few questions for me, mainly about my family. I do know I felt refreshed after meeting him. I grew up watching him on TV and it will be one meeting I never forget, Hughes was quoted as saying.         
	Asked if slump in form and how to overcome it came up for discussion, Hughes answered in the negative.         
	I dont think Sachin has ever had one, he said.         
	The first thing I did say to him was, I think Ive got you covered height-wise, and that hasnt happened too often, said Hughes.         
	Sachin had just finished a gym session and we basically had a casual conversation over lunch and coffee. We did speak about a couple of things, but I wont let on too much, said the left-hander who was axed after the second Ashes Test.         
	NSW coach Matthew Mott praised Hughes for taking the initiative to meet Tendulkar and said: Any time you can pick the brains of a great player, especially if theyre a Test player, its got to be a great opportunity.         
	We were fortunate enough to have Steve Waugh come in and speak to the (NSW) players last week and you could tell by their questions they were genuinely excited to pick the brains of a great.

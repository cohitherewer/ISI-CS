The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jadeja gets maiden call-up
                                                   Jadeja gets maiden call-up
    - Harbhajan Singh unfit for Lanka; Praveen Kumar 5th medium-pacer           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: The national selectors recognised both current form and past performance in choosing the Team India 15 for the short tour of Sri Lanka.         
	Five ODIs and a one-off Twenty20 International have been scheduled on the January 26-February 11 trip.         
	That 13 picked themselves was highlighted in these columns in the lead-up to Sunday afternoons meeting in Mumbai. That Ravindra Jadeja was in line for his maiden call-up and Praveen Kumar could make a comeback had also been mentioned by The Telegraph.                     
	The selection-script unfolded exactly that way.         
	Saurashtra allrounder Jadeja, No.6 among run-getters and No.2 on the bowlers list in the just-ended Ranji Trophy, has come in for Harbhajan Singh.         
	The offie has a hamstring injury.         
	Jadeja, 20, would almost surely have been heading to Sri Lanka even if Harbhajan was fit. He would, in all probability, then have been in the squad at the expense of Pragyan Ojha, a left-armer like him.         
	UP medium-pacer Kumar had a pedestrian Ranji Trophy, managing only 18 wickets in seven matches, but he has a good record in ODIs. That worked in the 22-year-olds favour, whose last India appearance had been in Colombo, five months ago.         
	Krishnamachari Srikkanth and his colleagues have, in fact, chosen five medium-pacers. Thats because spearheads Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma need to be fielded judiciously.         
	Zaheer and Ishants workload has to be monitored, or else we may have a major problem with their fitness.         
	As expected, young Virat Kohli has had to miss the tour, otherwise a fifth medium-pacer couldnt have been accommodated.         
	Irfan Pathan and Munaf Patel complete the quintet.         
	Rudra Pratap Singh, meanwhile, has informed the selectors that he intends undergoing rehab at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore. In the just-ended Ranji Trophy final, hed bowled only four overs in the second innings.         
	RP has withdrawn from the Duleep Trophy and his place (in the Central squad) has gone to the promising Bhuvneswar Kumar. A replacement will also be named for (Praveen) Kumar, said a source.         
	Srikkanth and Co., one learns, will (among others) be closely watching Ajinkya Rahane, Cheteshwar Pujara, Dhawal Kulkarni and Bhuvneswar in the soon-to-begin Duleep Trophy.         
	The likes of Lakshmipathy Balaji (who was briefly discussed on Sunday) and Sreesanth as well.  
	THE SRI LANKA-BOUND 15  
	 (Seniority-wise)  
	Batsmen: Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag  (vice-capt.), Yuvraj Singh, Gautam
  Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma.

	Spinner: Pragyan Ojha.  
	Medium-pacers: Zaheer Khan, Irfan Pathan, Munaf  Patel, Ishant Sharma, Praveen Kumar.  
	 Note: Sachin, Sehwag, Yuvraj, Yusuf and Jadeja can be  called up on to bowl their brand of spin.

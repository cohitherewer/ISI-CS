The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bench strong enough: Viru
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bench strong enough: Viru
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Stand-in Team India captain Virender Sehwag is confident his boys will capitalise on the initiative gained from the victory in Cuttack and said they would like to close the series at Eden Gardens on Thursday.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Missing the men in form (Yuvraj Singh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni)         
	Yuvraj and Dhoni are both match winners. When the series is going on the team has to play the matches, irrespective of who is in or out. Definitely, we will miss their services but we have to look at our other options and make do with what we have.         
	Expectations from Virat Kohli         
	He is an extremely talented player. In the Champions Trophy, he scored a fantastic half-century (vs the West Indies in Indias final group match). He has impressed with whatever opportunities he has got so far. Even in Nagpur, he scored a fine half-century. Its always a good opportunity for youngsters to prove themselves in these circumstances. We are hopeful that Virat will do well.         
	Challenge of leading a side missing key players         
	Even when someone like Sachin Tendulkar is injured and misses a match, people talk. But the game never stops. It goes on and we have to adjust to the situation. Having said that, we have a lot of talented youngsters who are ready to take up the challenge. You have Virat, Rohit Sharma all of whom are capable of doing well at the international level. This shows we have good bench strength, which is important for the development of the side. If they do well and make a mark its good for the team as well. The bench strength will get stronger and stronger.         
	Indians have often slipped in bilateral series         
	Yes, it was really disappointing to lose the one-day series against Australia after leading at one point. Yes, it is a concern that we didnt win from an advantageous position. However, we will definitely have to fight till the end and not become complacent. We have to grab each and every opportunity that comes our way.         
	The Eden wicket         
	Eden Gardens has always had good batting wickets. Theres always been high-scoring games over here. Once we scored close to 300 and yet Pakistan easily chased the target. Its not going to be much different this time.         
	Will dew be a worry?         
	Dew has always been a factor at the Eden over the years. Therefore, if we win the toss, we should field first.         
	Seamers getting an advantage due to the open ends at the stadium         
	I dont think seamers will get any special help. ODI cricket is very much dominated by batsmen. So, the breeze that will be coming in from the open ends will hardly be of any help.         
	Role of the spinners         
	They will play a significant role in the match. Both Harbhajan (Singh) and (Ravindra) Jadeja bowled brilliantly in the last match. I am confident they will keep up the good work.         
	Ashish Nehra coming in as first change bowler         
	Yes, we are sticking to the same plan.         
	Tillekaratne Dilshans batting         
	Its very difficult to have a strategy for Dilshan. He is in such fine form that it is difficult for any bowler to contain him. Lets hope that we get him early.         
	Eden reduced to half its capacity         
	Its always enjoyable to play in front of a full house. But this is something weve got to accept as renovation work is on for the 2011 World Cup. Remember, there will be a full house during the World Cup with better seating arrangements.

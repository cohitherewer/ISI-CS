	In the world of tennis, Grand Slam titles are used as the yardstick to measure the stature of the alltime greats. With a tally of 14, Pete Sampras has ruled the world of the alltime greats for many years. In the summer of 2008, preWimbledon, Roger Federer with a total of 12 such titles seemed to have Sampras record in his sights.         
	Specially, since, the next 3 Grand Slams  Wimbledon (on grass), the U.S. Open and the Australian Open 2009 (on hard courts)  were on his most favoured surfaces. At Wimbledon 2008 Federer succumbed to Nadal in a four hour and 48 minute epic match (9/7 in the fifth set) which was rated as one of the greatest finals ever.         
	Written off by critics Federer came back strongly to win the U.S. Open water boarding Andy Murray with a deluge of winners in the final. The final of Australian Open 2009 produced yet another gem of an encounter against Nadal, which will be remembered as a milestone in the history of the game. It was clear that Nadal had finally pinned Federers shoulders to the mat and established himself as a worthy No. 1 of the tennis world.         
	Unlike Sampras and Federer, Nadal has conquered on all surfaces. He toiled hard and adapted his spinladen game to win on faster surfaces by adding a flattish forehand and a flat first service. Nadal can now be rated as the greatest claycourt player of all times. Though Federers decline is evident from his losses to Murray and Novak Djokovic, he still has in his sights the elusive French Open  a tournament he would have won but for the presence of Nadal.         
	After his recent marriage to long time girlfriend Mirka Vavrinec, Federer stated that I dont necessarily need to get to No. 1! I just need to win the French Open. He could not do it when he was younger and when at his peak, so can Federer now stoke his intensity and passion to conjure one final burst of brilliance to grasp his first French title.         
	To succeed Federer will have to vault over the debilitating physical drain of 782 matches over 10 years, capped by an amazing 237 weeks as No. 1. Federer is the $ 45 million man (prize money) of tennis who crisscrossed the globe like the lines of the birds nest and adorned his crown with 57 titles. He left a trail of unmatched winning streaks, and stirring performances bordering on the surreal.         
	Three things hastened Federers decline. Firstly, his bout of mononucleosis in the later part of 2007, secondly, the relentless pursuit by Nadal, and finally, the imperceptible but inevitable decline in reflex and movement with age.         
	The mononucleosis bug further depleted the 28-year-old Federers near empty fuel tank (after 10 punishing years of protennis).         
	Sadly Federer fell short of equalling Sampras record by just a few shots in the 2008 Wimbledon final. The loss shattered Federers dreams of being the greatest ever and was a crippling blow to his self-belief  a vital ingredient in the makeup of a champion.         
	For Djokovic and Murray they can now believe that they can beat Federer. Nadal, a new monarch of the game has distanced himself from the field and left Federer by a substantial margin in the rankings. The others, Murray  No. 3 and Djokovic  No. 4 are within striking distance of Federers No. 2 ranking.         
	With the French Championships coming up this month, Nadal, a fourtime champion from 2005 to 2008, seems unassailable and firmly established as the No. 1 of the world.         
	2009 will be a fascinating year for tennis rich with promise.

                                                   Win keeps England alive
                      
	London: England kept themselves afloat in the ICC World Twenty20 Championship after humbling Pakistan by 48 runs in their must-win Group B match, here on Sunday.         
	Englands chances to make the Super Eight stage were hanging by a thread after suffering a humiliating defeat against The Netherlands in their opening match on Friday.         
	Facing early elimination from the home event, England top-order responded to the SOS call by superb batting as the hosts reached challenging 185 for 5 after sent in to bat.         
	Kevin Pietersen made a timely return to the side with a masterly 58 and was well supported by Luke Wright (34) and Owais Shah (33).         
	The hosts, riding on a spirited attack, then restricted the Pakistanis to 137 for seven in their 20 overs at the Oval.         
	Feeling the pressure of chasing a huge total, Pakistan never recovered from a top-order collapse though skipper Younis Khan held one end with a defiant unbeaten 46.         
	Stuart Broad (3/17) did the early damage by dismissing Kamral Akmal and Salman Butt (28) on consecutive balls in the sixth over after Dimitri Mascarenhas had got rid off Ahmad Shahzad (4).         
	Younis and Shoaib Malik (20) put some resistance and revived the innings with a 46-run partnership but the required run rate soared over 12 runs per over.         
	Once Malik was caught behind off Wright, Younis was left stranded as his teammates came and departed in a hurry.         
	Luke Wright was adjudged Man-of-the-Match for his all- round show. He took one wicket after making 34 off 16 balls in England innings.         
	Pakistan now must win their next match against The Netherlands on Tuesday to qualify for the next stage.         
	Earlier, Pietersen and Wright shared a 53-run stand for the second wicket after the early loss of Ravi Bopara (5). Pietersen then added 66 for the third wicket Owais Shah.         
	At one stage the hosts were heading towards a 200-plus score but Saeed Ajmals double strike in the 17th over pegged them back. The off-spinner first dismissed rival skipper Paul Collingwood (15) and then sent back Pietersen.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ferrari warning for Badoer
                                                   Ferrari warning for Badoer
                      
	Valencia: Formula One champions Ferrari could replace stand-in driver Luca Badoer if the Italian does not raise his game significantly in Belgium next weekend.         
	Badoer, the 38-year-old test driver making his comeback nearly a decade after his last race, struggled as a replacement for injured Brazilian Felipe Massa in Sundays European Grand Prix.         
	The Italian has said he has the job until Massa returns, which may not be this season, but team boss Stefano Domenicali sounded less sure of that after Badoer was the last car to cross the line in 17th place.         
	For us the first priority is to understand when Felipe Massa will come back, he told reporters. For sure it is an important race for Luca next weekend. We are expecting a big jump from him and then we will see. (Reuters)

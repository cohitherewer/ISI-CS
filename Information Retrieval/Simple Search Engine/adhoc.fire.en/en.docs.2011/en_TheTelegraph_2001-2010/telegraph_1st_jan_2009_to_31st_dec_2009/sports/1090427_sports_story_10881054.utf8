The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Super Sunday for Bagan 
                                                     Super Sunday for Bagan 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Barreto                           
	Gurgaon: Mohun Bagan nudged past Churchill Brothers 2-1 in the battle of the champions  the Super Cup  but it was only a small consolation for losing out on the biggest of them all, the I-League.         
	Mohun Bagan finished runners-up to Churchill Brothers in the I-League, but at the Devi Lal stadium here on Sunday, the Calcutta side displayed greater tactical sense to rein in the Goa side.         
	Evergreen Brazilian striker Jose Ramirez Barreto once again made all the difference when he scored the match winner with a brilliant header two minutes before the final whistle.         
	Bagans masterstroke Sunday was their ability to keep Odafe Okolie on a tight leash. The Bagan defenders kept strict vigil on Naoba Singh, Robert Lalthlamuana and Ogba Kalu and did not allow the trio to build the game in the middle for Odafe to finish it off in the danger area.         
	Yes, it was a tactical move and it clicked, said a visibly happy Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa at the end of the match. We are all very happy with the win.         
	Bagan were definitely the better side and took the lead in the 21st minute through N.S. Manju, who headed in a corner kick from James Singh. Churchill equalised a minute from half-time when Reisangmi Vaschum made his way through the right and took a shot. Defender Deepak Mondal tried to clear but all he managed to do was to put the ball into his own net.         
	In the end, there was celebration in the Bagan camp. Skipper Bhaichung Bhutia, who received the Super Cup and a cheque for Rs 10 lakh on behalf of his club, said he was delighted to end the season on a winning note.

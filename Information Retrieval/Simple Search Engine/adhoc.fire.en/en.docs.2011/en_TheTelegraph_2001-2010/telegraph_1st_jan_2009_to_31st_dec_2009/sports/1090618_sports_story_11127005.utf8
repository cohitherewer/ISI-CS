The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spain in last four
                                                   Spain in last four
                      
	Bloemfontein: Spain earned their record-tying 14th straight win and a spot in the Confederations Cup semi-finals by beating Iraq 1-0 on Wednesday.         
	David Villa slipped between two defenders and beat Iraq goalkeeper Mohammed Kassid for the only goal of the match in the 55th minute, sending Joan Capdevilas cross low and inside the right post for his 30th goal in his 46th international appearance.         
	The Valencia striker moved into sole possession of second place in Spains scoring charts, trailing only Raul Gonzalezs 44.         
	Spain matched Brazil, France and Australia as the only teams to win 14 straight games and is now within one game of matching Brazils record 35-game unbeaten run. A victory against host South Africa in Spains final Group A match would see them become the first team to win 15 straight in all competitions.         
	Spain lead the group with six points, while Iraq still have one.         
	Despite the defeat, Iraq coach Bora Milutinovic was beaming after a near perfect performance.

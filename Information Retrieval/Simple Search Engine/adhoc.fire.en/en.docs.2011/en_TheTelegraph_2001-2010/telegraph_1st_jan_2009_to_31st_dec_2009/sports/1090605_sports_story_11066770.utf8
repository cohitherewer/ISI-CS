                                                     The Thoroughbreds
                      The best of the best will walk out to show who the masters are in the shortest format of cricket when the ICC World Twenty20 starts at Lords today. After an exhilarating IPL, the second edition of the tournament is sure to once again provide edge-of-the-seat excitement to all.   Heres a look at the seeded teams from each group:                                                     
	GROUP A     INDIA 
                        Are the Indian players mentally, if not physically, jaded? That seems more the talking pointthan the sides solid performance in all forms of the game during the past year. Opinion has varied, but the big stage is sure to spur the Mahendra Singh Dhoni led side on. This young and talented bunch will have to deal with the pressure of being the defending champions but they have shown the resilience of beating the odds in the past. The failure of some of their top-order batsmen in the recently concluded IPL could in fact prove to be a boon in disguise. And, not to forget the pacers, who can prove to be a handful in the English conditions if they wish to recreate the summer of 1983!       BANGLADESH                  The minnows have not really transformed their image, but as history suggests, they have the capability to upset calculations at any time. A bright chance to make it to the Super Eight would be an extra motivation for Mohammed Ashrafuls boys. Tamim Iqbals pyrotechnics, as India learnt the hard way in the West Indies in 2007, and Mashrafe Mortazas pace and movement could embarrass the big guns. Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahims presence also lends solidity to the top-order. The lack of class can be supplemented by a committed young bunch keen to make their mark on the world stage.       
	GROUP B   
	 PAKISTAN                   Deprived of international cricket at home, Pakistan will be keen to prove a point. That the likes of Umar Gul and Sohail Tanvir can be a handful for any   side was discovered by the Kolkata Knight Riders and the Rajasthan  Royals, who missed them in this years IPL. Gul will have a relatively inexperienced, but exciting, left-armer Mohammed Aamer for company, who is capable of providing anxious moments to the batsmen. The English conditions may test their batsmen but in captain Younis Khan and all-rounder Shahid Afridi they have the experience and potential to tame any opposition. Pakistan can never be written off given their unpredictability.            ENGLAND
                    Home advantage can both work for or against England, but Paul Collingwood and Co. can take heart from the fact that they have the momentum going in their favour after the series against the West Indies. They will, however, have to cope with the absence of Andrew Flintoff. Kevin Pietersen could still tilt the scales, though by his own admission, he is no good at T20. But dont discount Ravi Bopara. Englands stand-out performer for Kings XI Punjab at the IPL, translated his confidence into back-to-back hundreds in the Test series versus the West Indies. Lack of expectations could spur the home side on in their bid to surprise a few.    
	GROUP C   
	 AUSTRALIA
                      Twenty20 is one form where the Australians have failed to establish their dominance. Ricky Ponting wasnt sure of success in the games latest format and only promised a bold showing in the lead-up to the tournament. They lost to Pakistan in Dubai in their last T20 encounter and have never shown the confidence that has been their hallmark in international cricket. To make it tougher, they have been placed with Sri Lanka and the West Indies in their group. But the presence of David Hussey, Nathan Bracken and Brett Lee always makes them formidable. The urge to treat the format more seriously may finally help them achieve success.      SRILANKA
                    An opportunity for Kumar Sangakkaras men to put behind the dreadful memories of the past. If the IPL is any yardstick, Sangakkara has enough matchwinners in his side to make his debut as captain memorable. A tough group will mean they cant afford to relax and have to strike form early to make it to the Super Eight. An enviable batting line-up and a versatile bowling attack make them formidable, but ageing players can be a drawback. Lasith Malinga could be more than a handful in helpful conditions. If Sanath Jayasuriya gets going at the top, and Muttiah Muralidharan and Ajantha Mendis are able to mesmerise in the English climes, therell be no stopping them.    
	GROUP D   
	 NEW ZEALAND
                    Daniel Vettoris men are the dark horses, mainly because the side is stacked with allrounders, a vital component in this format. The way they demolished defending champions India at home earlier this year lends credence to their capabilities. In the inaugural edition, they bowed out to Pakistan in the semi-finals. The success of their players in the IPL also makes them formidable opponents. While Vettori remains the most important with his left-arm spin, Jesse Ryder and Brendon McCullum can destroy any attack on their day. Jacob Oram has the ability to finish it off in style, lending the indomitable tag to their line-up.     
	SOUTH AFRICA
                    The No.1 team in one-day cricket will look to extend their supremacy in the games shortest version as well. No doubt, they are sturdy challengers given the success of their players in the IPL. Graeme Smith has used the warm-up games to put to rest doubts over his form. But the biggest challenge will be to shed their chokers tag on the big stage. The achievements of Herschelle Gibbs, AB de Villiers and JP Duminy in the IPL lends extra solidity to their batting. In Johan Botha and Roelof van der Merwe they have an excellent spin pair. Given their athletic fielding and solid bowling, Smiths men have a good chance to cap off a great season in style.

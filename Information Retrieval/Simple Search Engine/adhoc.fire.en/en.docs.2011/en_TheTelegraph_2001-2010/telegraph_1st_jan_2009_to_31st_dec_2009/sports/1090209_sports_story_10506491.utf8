                                                     Australians end losing streak

	Sydney: Australia on Sunday snapped their losing streak in one-day Internationals by registering a 32-run victory over New Zealand in the must-win third tie here and kept the five-match series alive.         
	Australia, who were bolstered by the forced return of captain Ricky Ponting, rode on wicketkeeper Brad Haddins maiden ton (109) to post 301 for nine, after New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori inserted them in.         
	They then bundled out the Black Caps for 269 in 47.3 overs to notch up their first win of the series. New Zealand lead the series 2-1.         
	The hosts with Grant Elliott (115) almost single-handedly threatening to win the match for New Zealand with a superb crunch-time maiden hundred only to fail near the finishing line. Chasing a target of 302 to seal the series, New Zealand started their reply disastrously and by the sixth over they were two down for 16.         
	But Elliott, with some initial help from opener Peter Fulton (40 in 63 balls), carried the New Zealand innings to 225 for seven at the end of the 40th over.         
	Needing 77 runs from the last 10 overs with three wickets in hand, it looked like Australia would suffer a back-to-back ODI series loss, but Elliotts dismissal off James Hopes in the 45th over settled the issue.         
	Elliott, who came in the sixth over when his side was 16 for two, made his 115 from 125 balls with the help of eight fours. For Australia, Nathan Bracken, Ben Hilfenhaus, James Hopes and Cameron White shared the spoils with two wickets apiece.         
	Earlier, the hosts tinkered with the opening combination for the second time in the series with Haddin replacing David Warner at the top but that proved a masterstroke as the wicketkeeper blasted a 114-ball 109.

                                                     Mary Ann happy with Paris show
            A STAFF REPORTER            Mary Ann Gomes                           
	Calcutta: WGM Mary Ann Gomes, who was adjudged the Best Woman Player in the recently-concluded Championship International de Paris, said that it was one of the strongest tournaments she had ever competed in.         
	The experience in Paris was very good, Mary Ann, who reached the city on Tuesday, said.         
	The tournament had a very strong field. There were only 62 players in the meet and all were above the 2200 Elo rating. It wasnt a usual tournament where you get to play lower ranked players, the BA student of St Xaviers College said.         
	A product of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship, Mary Ann got her first International Master (IM) norm during the tournament.         
	Honestly speaking, I did not expect it. It was my first tournament after a six-month lay-off. I had stopped playing due to my board examinations and all I had wanted to do was play well. That was my main aim, said Mary Ann who is currently rated with an Elo of 2332.         
	She garnered 31 Elo points from the Paris meet.         
	About her future plans, the 19-year-old said she would like to complete the IM as early as possible. Completing the IM norm is my priority right now. The Calcutta Open is scheduled to be held in September and a good performance will take me forward, said Mary Ann, who practises at the Dibyendu Barua Chess Academy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav set to attend AGM
                                                     Sourav set to attend AGM
            A STAFF REPORTER            Sourav Ganguly                           
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly is all set to attend the annual general meeting of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) on July 31.         
	According to sources, it is still undecided as to which club the former India captain will represent at the AGM, but it could be one from among Mohammedan Sporting, South Suburban and Barisha Sporting.         
	According to a source, Sourav has agreed to be present at the AGM before leaving for London on Monday evening. He has been invited to lecture at Oxford as part of the International Cricket Councils centenary celebrations.         
	Sourav, who has expressed a desire to get into cricket administration, decided against contesting the CAB presidents post this time. The opposition, in a desperate attempt to oust Jagmohan Dalmiya, had tried hard to convince Sourav to join the fray.         
	He has no reservations about attending the AGM and is open to the idea. Finding a club for him wont be a problem, said a member of the opposition.         
	Souravs presence could be the only surprise at the AGM, which is unlikely to see a fight for the presidents post. In the absence of Prasun Mukherjee the opposition has failed to find a suitable candidate after Sourav turned down the offer.         
	The joint secretarys posts may, however, see an election where Sujan Mukherjee is likely to challenge the current incumbents.         
	Sourav is also likely to find a place in the CAB working committee when it is newly constituted after the AGM. The committee comprises 40 members with each of them being appointed on a rotation basis. He can also be co-opted in the committee if the members want to include him.         
	Souravs wish to get into administration set the rumour mills abuzz with some even tipping him for the Board of Control for Cricket in India presidents post in 2014.         
	This is all speculation. I havent decided anything and its not about fighting elections Its about trying to help the game. I want to be at a place from where I can help the game, he said recently.         
	Meanwhile, the CAB has decided to honour former Bengal captain Shyam Sundar Mitra with the lifetime achievement award. The award carries prize money of Rs 1 lakh.         
	Newly-appointed Bengal coach Roger Binny may get a fielding coach in his support staff. The CAB has also decided to utilise former consultant Mohinder Amarnaths experience through seminars and other suitable means.

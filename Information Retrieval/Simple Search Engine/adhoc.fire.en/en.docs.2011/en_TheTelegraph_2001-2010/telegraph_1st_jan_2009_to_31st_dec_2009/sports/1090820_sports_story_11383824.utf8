The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arindam included in Bengal probables
                                                   Arindam included in Bengal probables
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Five players, including Arindam Das, were added to Bengal probables list Wednesday. The others are Kamal Hasan Mondal, Surajit Das, Soumya Pakre and Ranjit Singh.         
	Arindam was the notable absentee from the earlier list of 35 probables. CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey, who is also the convenor of the selection committee, admitted it was a mistake.         
	Arindam and the others have the performances. Bengal need them. As convenor, I missed the names It was an administrative oversight.         
	These guys have a good record in local cricket in the last season So I decided to include them in consultation with the selectors, Dey said.         
	The new selection committee will be formed after September 15.         
	Bengal will have their physical conditioning at the SAI complex from Friday under Vece Paes. Coach Roger Binny is expected to join at the end of this month.         
	Meanwhile, Sourav Ganguly is likely to be included in the cricket development committee that will be formed at the first meeting of the newly-formed working committee on Saturday.         
	Besides the former India captain, national selector Raja Venkat is also part of the working committee.         
	The meeting could thus turn out to be a stormy one in case the members decide to discuss the issue of Bengal players not finding favour with the national selectors.         
	It will, however, depend on whether Jagmohan Dalmiya gives the necessary permission to discuss the issue, which is not listed in the agenda.

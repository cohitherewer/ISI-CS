The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rueful Tiger gets support
                                                                                                                       7                                        Rueful Tiger gets support
            'Larry Dorman amp; Stuart Elliott            Tiger Woods                             
	Companies that pay Tiger Woods to endorse their products are standing by him but at least one squeezed in a time-bound rider.         
	The world No.1 golfer confessed to unnamed sins on Wednesday, and although he was not specific about exactly what he was sorry for, the unusual admission by the usually composed Woods has prompted his biggest sponsors to reaffirm their support for him.         
	Nike, Woodss biggest sponsor, said that its advertising plans involving him would not change. Tiger and his family have Nikes full support, a Nike statement read. We respect Tigers request for privacy and our thoughts are with Tiger and his family at this time.         
	Woods is the lone athlete among the top 10 celebrity pitchmen, behind only Will Smith and Brad Pitt, according to a recent survey by a research firm.         
	The Gillette unit of Procter amp; Gamble  which on Monday issued a brief response that Tigers statement speaks for itself  on Wednesday issued an expanded comment.         
	Like each of us, they are human, Gillettes statement said. And like each of us, they make mistakes. By acknowledging and learning from their mistakes, we hope they will become even better, both in the game and beyond.         
	A Gillette spokesman, Michael Norton, added on Wednesday, At this time, we are not making any changes to our existing marketing programs.         
	Although the tone of that remark was neutral to positive, saying at this time kept Gillettes options open. Large corporations play hardball, and as Phil de Picciotto, president of a marketing firm, sees it, recent events have made hardball much more of a possibility in future negotiations with Woods.         
	Companies may use this opportunity as an excuse to try to renegotiate compensation, given their outside budget pressures due to the economy, De Picciotto said. Or they may take the tack that, We stood by Tiger, we had to suspend some advertising, and therefore theres some diminished value and wed like a reduction in price or an extension.         
	Somebody might come in and say, We wont terminate Tiger, but we want a sizeable reduction because weve protected Tiger and his image  we protected you when he most needed it  and we want a reduction in payments or more years. They would need a legal hook to grab onto.         
	If there is such a hook, IMG would have to give it to them, he said, referring to Woodss management group.           NYT NEWS SERVICE

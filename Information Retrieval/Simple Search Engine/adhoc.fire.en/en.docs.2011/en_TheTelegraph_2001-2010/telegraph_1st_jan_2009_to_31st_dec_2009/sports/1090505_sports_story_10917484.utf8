The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan to play for pride
                                                     Bagan to play for pride
                  Bhaichung Bhutia                     
	New Delhi: Federation Cup winners Mohun Bagan would be looking to salvage some pride in their AFC Cup campaign when they take on Al Wehdat of Jordan at the King Abdullah International Stadium in Amman on Tuesday.         
	Mohun Bagan have so far lost all the four matches they have played in Group D. Their worst defeat came in the last match when they lost 0-6 to Kuwait SC at home.         
	The team, which finished runners-up in the I-League, would be banking on captain Bhaichung Bhutia to provide some respectability to their campaign.         
	Bhutia left India on Monday and would be joining the team for the match. However, the green-and-maroon side is dogged by injuries. They will miss the services of talismanic striker Jose Barreto, goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee and right full back Habibur Rehman Mondal.         
	Coach Karim Bencherifa said they would have to go ahead with what they have.         
	We have some injuries in the team, Bencherifa told the AFCs official website. However, we have suitable replacements and I dont think that we will have any problems with this.         
	Things are not easy for us in the game and hopefully we can get a convincing result, the Moroccan added.         
	Jordan champions Al Wehdat won their first leg encounter 2-1 and a win on Tuesday could increase their qualification chances for the next round provided group toppers Kuwait SC dont lose to Al Karama of Syria in the other league match.         
	Our win against Al Karamah gave us a big push to get back into contention to qualify from the group, said Al Wehdat assistant coach Jamal Mahmoud. The players are ready for the game especially because we dont have any local matches at the moment.

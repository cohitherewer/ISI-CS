The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vettori hands NZ the edge
                                                                                                                       7                                      Vettori hands NZ the edge
                      
	Napier: Captain Daniel Vettori carved out an unbeaten 127-ball 100 to give New Zealand the upperhand at the close of the second days play of the third Test against Pakistan here Saturday.         
	Vettori, with able assistance from Brendon McCullum (89), helped the hosts to finish the day on 346 for six, a lead of 123 runs with four wickets still to go.         
	According to Cricinfo, leg-spinner Danish Kaneria was the most successful Pakistan bowler claiming four for 119.         
	The Test, however, was evenly balanced at tea. New Zealand were trailing by 57 runs with only five wickets in hand, McCullum and Vettori were yet to settle in, Kaneria was on a rampage and the second new ball wasnt far away. Either team could have grabbed the advantage.         
	It was Vettori and McCullum who broke the shackles of the first two sessions with a combination of intelligence and exhilarating strokeplay, and seized control of the game.         
	McCullum was explosive, improvising constantly, while Vettori combined aggression with solidity.

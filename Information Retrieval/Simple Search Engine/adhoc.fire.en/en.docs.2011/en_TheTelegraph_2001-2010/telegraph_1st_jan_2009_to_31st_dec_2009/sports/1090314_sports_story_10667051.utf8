                                                   Raise your game: Jhulan
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India captain Jhulan Goswami Friday urged teammates to raise their standard when they take on Australia in the first Super Six match in Sydney Saturday.         
	The two teams have met 32 times with Australia winning 27 matches and India just five.         
	Jhulan said the team is yet to play its best cricket and hoped her players would fire in this stage.         
	We havent been playing up to our standards, but tomorrows match is very important and we have to play good cricket and play positively, said the pacer.         
	Last time we learnt lots of things and I am hoping we wont make the same mistakes again. Hopefully we will play sensible cricket and perform like a champion, she added.         
	Australia captain Karen Rolton said the team would start afresh in the Super Six stage.         
	We will go into the Super Six stage as if it was the start of the tournament, going game by game, she said.         
	In other matches on Saturday, New Zealand take on England at Bankstown while Pakistan meet the West Indies at Drummoyne.         
	Meanwhile, the bowling action of England fast bowler Jenny Gunn has been declared legal after analysis, according to an ICC release.

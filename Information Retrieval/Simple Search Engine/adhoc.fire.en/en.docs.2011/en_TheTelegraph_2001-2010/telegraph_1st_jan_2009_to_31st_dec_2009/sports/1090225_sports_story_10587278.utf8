The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We may move court: Kapil Dev
                                                     We may move court: Kapil Dev
  - Things should be clear after a week or so, says ICL board chairman       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Kapil                                 
	Calcutta: As a sportsman, I dont like matters of sport being decided in court, but with the talks failing (again), we may have no choice but to take recourse to law, is how Kapil Dev reacted on Tuesday morning, some 12 hours after the impasse in Johannesburg.         
	Kapil is chairman of the board which runs the Zee-promoted Indian Cricket League (ICL). The ICL is seeking recognition from the International Cricket Council (ICC) as that would then have a direct bearing on the turf in India.         
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has outlawed the ICL and is aggressively promoting the Indian Premier League, which also has the Twenty20 format.         
	I cant understand who has given the BCCI the right to be the sole authority for promoting cricket in India... The ICL too is doing just that, so why should our boys be punished? That, to me, is not justice, Kapil, a World Cup-winning captain, told The Telegraph, when contacted on his cellphone.         
	The talks in Johannesburg had been convened by the ICC, which is aware that the courts could get into the picture sooner rather than later.         
	Given the BCCIs clout in the ICC, its highly unlikely that the latters executive board will grant recognition to the ICL. With no settlement being reached, the ball is back on the executive boards table.         
	Obviously, the BCCI wants the ICL to be scrapped but, from a cricketing point of view, thats not possible... I got a call from our people late last night (from Johannesburg), saying they were returning home as no agreement was reached... From our side, things should be clear after a week or so, Kapil pointed out.         
	Asked why he hadnt been part of the ICL delegation (which comprised Zee boss Subhas Chandra and Himanshu Mody), Kapil replied: It wasnt necessary... Those responsible for the finances were there...         
	The stakes, clearly, are high.         
	Kapil disagreed with a suggestion that an environment where recession was thick in the air would hurt the ICL.         
	I dont think the ad revenues fell in the second edition (2008-09)... I dont see a problem... We had to scrap the World Series because of the terror strikes in Mumbai, but that was a one-off happening... Please wait for a few days... As Ive said, from a cricketing perspective, the ICL cant be stopped... We do have plans...         
	Incidentally, Kapil and the other former India cricketers whose pensions have been stopped by the BCCI have already initiated legal action.         
	Footnote: Following an order by the Sindh high court, those playing for the ICL have again become eligible for domestic cricket in Pakistan. Its a fairly recent development.

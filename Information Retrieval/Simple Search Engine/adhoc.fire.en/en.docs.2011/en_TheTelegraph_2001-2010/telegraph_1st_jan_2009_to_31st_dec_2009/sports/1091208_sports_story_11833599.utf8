The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bayern, Juve face moment of truth

	London: With six European titles between them, Bayern Munich and Juventus have grown accustomed to advancing in the Champions League, but one of them will be eliminated Tuesday when they meet in the last round of the group stage.         
	Having already seen five-time champions Liverpool crash out two weeks ago, AC Milan, Inter Milan and Marseille also know that their status as former European Cup winners doesnt make them immune from exiting in a tense finale.         
	Bordeaux can breathe easily having topped Group A and the French side are an onlooker as Munich and Juventus face off for second. A repeat of Septembers 0-0 draw at Germany would see double-European winners Juve prevail because they are a point ahead of Munich.         
	We must be wise and humble and understand that if we put all into the match we can do well, Juve captain Alessandro del Piero said.         
	Knowing they have to win in Turin to advance, Bayern, who captured their fourth continental title in 2001, are determined to ignore the Italians 16-match unbeaten home run in the Champions League.         
	But Bayern will be without midfield star Franck Ribery, who has only recently started practising again after being sidelined for two weeks with tendinitis in his left knee.         
	The teams with the most European Cups between them  Madrid (nine) and Milan (seven)  occupy the top two qualification spots in Group C, but 1993 champions Marseille could deny either of them a place in the knockout phase on Wednesday.         
	Third-place Marseille must beat Real to have a chance of advancing. If FC Zurich, who cant take the Europa League spot, can repeat their earlier victory over Milan, Marseille would advance alongside Madrid even by beating the Spanish club.         
	Madrid, who are without the injured Kaka, can only be eliminated if Marseille beat them by at least a three-goal margin and Milan also triumph. But Madrid drawing with Marseille would send the big-spenders through with Milan regardless of the Italian sides result.         
	In Group B, Manchester United just need to draw at Wolfsburg on Tuesday to secure top spot, but the German champions can still be caught by CSKA Moscow in the tussle for second. CSKA must better Wolfsburgs result against leader United.         
	United have flown to Germany with only one first-team defender in their 19-man squad. Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic, Wes Brown, Gary Neville, Rafael, Fabio, John Shea and Jonny Evans are all absent due to injury or illness.         
	Fullback Patrice Evra is the only first-choice back in the squad with 19-year-old Oliver Gill the only other recognised defender after Uniteds hopes to add Belgian youngster Ritchie de Laet were foiled when he was ruled ineligible due to registration issues. Midfielder Michael Carrick, who played in the back four in Saturdays 4-0 win at West Ham United, is likely to continue in the role, surrounded by a group of inexperienced youngsters.         
	Group Cs top two places have already been taken by Chelsea and Porto. Atletico Madrid, which host Porto, will take the Europa League place by matching Apoel Nicosias result at Chelsea. But the Cypriot champions have to better Atleticos result to continue their European journey.

                                                     Sehwag: Hope Ill find form
                  Virender Sehwag                     
	Bloemfontein: An out-of-form Delhi DareDevils captain Virender Sehwag feels it is just a matter of time before both he and teammate Gautam Gambhir would be back in form.         
	According to the swashbuckling right-handed batsman, who is yet to fire in the ongoing second edition Indian Premier League (IPL), it will be an added advantage for his team if he and Gambhir both start firing from the opening overs in the next matches.         
	Both of us (Gautam Gambhir and I) have flopped but AB de Villiers and (Tillekaratne) Dilshan batted well again. They played sensibly and according to plan to take us to 150, Sehwag said after his sides 14-run victory over Rajasthan Royals Sunday night.         
	I hope I will get runs in next couple of matches that we have to play before the semi-final. And if Gautam and I manage to find our form, that will be bonus for our team, he said.         
	Meanwhile, De Villiers said that he and Dilshan were successful in the IPL because they stuck to their game plans. De Villiers said that the common thing between him and Dilshan was having faith in their skills.         
	I think we both have a simple game plan. He follows his plans in every game and I follow mine. And we have managed to stick to them throughout the tournament and that is very important for both of us, De Villiers said.         
	The idea is to stick to your game plan in any circumstance or pressure situation. We have to back our skills and that is what we both have been doing, he added.         
	Talking about his own batting, the South African said patience has been a key factor in his style of batting.         
	I think I have been following the same game plan for the last two years now. Whether I play Tests, one-day Internationals or Twenty20, I give myself a chance to get my eye in and get used to the conditions. I always try to get through the first 20 balls and from there on, I try to express myself, he said.         
	De Villiers said that though the next months World T20 Cup would be of a different level, yet the IPL experience would help.         
	It is always good to score some runs and get momentum going. I think skill level at the World Cup will be a bit higher but I have got runs here and will stick to my game plan and play my game, he told the IPL official website.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Collingwood mulls stepping down
                                                     Collingwood mulls stepping down
                  Collingwood after his dismissal on Monday                           
	Paul Collingwood will consider stepping down as the England captain in the shortest format after his side were knocked out of the World Twenty20 by the West Indies at the Brit Oval Monday night.         
	Although Collingwood found the latest experience of leading England more enjoyable than the inaugural event in South Africa two years ago, he twice stopped short of saying that he wants to retain the job.         
	I dont know, Collingwood said. I dont even know when our next Twenty20 game is.         
	Englands next Twenty20 international is against Australia at the end of August, but the third ICC event comes around as soon as April next year, when the West Indies play host.         
	Collingwood described elimination by five wickets under the Duckworth/Lewis method as a cruel way to go out. England had made 161 for six in their innings  which included a half-hour delay because of a shower  but heavy rain delayed the start of the West Indies innings until just before the cut-off point.         
	Chasing a revised target of 80 off nine overs, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Shivnarine Chanderpaul added an unbeaten 37 from 20 balls, but the failure of the England lower middle order to hit boundaries again proved costly.         
	We have shown fighting spirit all the way through the event, Collingwood said.         
	Hitting boundaries in the middle overs is obviously an area to look at for the future. We are catching up with our skills but it is very important we play more 20-over cricket if we are realistic about winning this kind of competition.         
	Chris Gayle, the West Indies captain, said: England needed a couple of power hitters in the middle overs and lost wickets at crucial moments.         
	Although Gayle won $1 million for winning the $20 million game in Antigua last November, he took greater pleasure from the latest success.         
	For England, the next challenge is the Ashes, with Collingwood happy to hand over to Andrew Strauss and rejoin the ranks for Test cricket.           THE TIMES, LONDON

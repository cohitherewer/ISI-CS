  - Green and maroon brigade to play for pride against Al Karamah today       A STAFF REPORTER            Al Karamah players (top) during a practice session on the eve of the AFC Cup match against Mohun Bagan.

	Calcutta: The build-up to Mohun Bagans last AFC Cup group match against Al Karamah of Syria is not at all to coach Karim Bencharifas liking. Whether the controversy over Bhaichung Bhutia being served a show cause notice and his subsequent news conference declaration that he wants to part ways with the club or missing key players due to card problems, Bagans preparation for their last match of the season has taken a severe beating. So, it wasnt surprising to see the green and maroon brigade looking disjointed during the practice session at the Howarh Stadium on Monday afternoon.         
	This is not an ideal way to prepare for an international match. The Bhaichung controversy has surely affected us, a young Bagan player, in his first season with the club, said on Monday evening.         
	Bencharifa, though promised that the green and maroon brigade will not bow down without a fight at the Howrah Stadium on Tuesday afternoon.         
	We are short on motivation, thats for sure. It happens when you play your last match of the season with nothing at stake. But then in a home match you cant afford to be lax, the Moroccan said at the customary pre-match news conference on Monday.         
	Apart from Bhaichung, Bagan will be without Deepak Mondal, Marcos Pereira (both serving a match-ban for a double yellow) and Anand Vasan who has gone to back Kerala for a family engagement. Bagan would draw strength from the fact that they played a great match against the Syrian club in Damascus. Had luck been on the their side, Bagan would have got at least a point from that match.         
	Pereira missed a penalty in that match and on Tuesday the man was ruing that.         
	That was a bad miss. But I think we played a great match and we deserved at least a point. If we can repeat that performance, Karamah wont have it easy on Tuesday, he said. But that was when they were still in contention for the I-League title and the players were motivated enough to put up a good performance. Post I-League, Bagans AFC Cup campaign has gone from bad to worse.         
	They conceded six goals against Al Wehdat (April 21) and five against Kuwait SC (May 5) on the road.         
	Bagans practice session on Monday hinted that Bencharifa might go for a 4-2-3-1 formation. Rakesh Masih and Lalramluaha will be playing in front of the back four with Ishfaq Ahmed, Lalkamal Bhowmick and James Singh giving support to the lone striker Jose Ramirez Barreto. The defence may see either Rino Anto or Habibur Rahman Mondal on the right side, with N. Mohanraj or Rahul Kumar on the left. Young and impressive Karanjit Atwal is likely to partner N.S. Manju in central defence.         
	If Bagan have only pride to play for, Al Karamah have a lot at stake. Now in third position with nine points from five matches, a victory for the visitors will see them through to the knock-out stage. Kuwait SC host Al Wehdat on the same day and, with both on 10 points each, whoever wins the match will top the group.         
	We have to win this match and we are confident of doing that, coach Mohammed Kwid said at a news conference.         
	The visitors have two foreigners in their ranks  defender Richard Etigieh of Cameroon and French forward Stephane Owona. Etigieh is huge and intimidating and just how Barreto deals with this Cameroonian remains to be seen.         
	But then, sometimes in soccer size doesnt matter.         
	Kick-off is at 3.00 p.m.

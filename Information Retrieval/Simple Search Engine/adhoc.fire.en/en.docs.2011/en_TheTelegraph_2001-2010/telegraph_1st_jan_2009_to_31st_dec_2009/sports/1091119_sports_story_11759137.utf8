The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karnataka in control
                                                                                                                                     Karnataka in control
  - Sourasishs late charge carries bengal to 324; pujara unbeaten on 204               Sourasish                           
	Mysore: After conceding three points at home in their last Ranji Trophy Super League match against Baroda, Bengal are staring at yet another disappointing result as Karnataka seized control on the second day of their tie in Mysore.         
	Unbeaten half-centuries by K.B. Pawan (77) and Amit Verma (84) steered Karnataka to a strong 186 for two after bundling out Bengal at 324 in the group B match.         
	Bengal, resuming at 252 for five, managed to add only 72 to their overnight score. Off-spinner Sourasish Lahiri used the long handle to good effect to chip in with 37.         
	Sourasishs quickfire knock off 26 balls helped the visitors cross the 300-run mark. He slammed seven boundaries during his stay. Karnataka took 16 overs to wrap up Bengals first innings at the Gangotri Glades ground on Wednesday.         
	R. Vinay Kumar and S. Arvind took three wickets each while Abhimanyu Mithun scalped two.         
	However, Bengal struck early with Ashok Dinda claiming Karnataka skipper Robin Uthhapa (5), caught by wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha.         
	Ganesh Satish (18), coming in place of Rahul Dravid, showed promise before Ranadeb Bose uprooted his stumps.         
	Pepped up by the early wickets (37 for two), Bengal sought to run through the Karnataka middle-order only to find two gutsy customers in Pawan and Verma, who added 149 for the third wicket. The duo batted with admirable grit and caution to ensure that their side would be in the reckoning to snatch the vital first innings lead.         
	Pawan struck six boundaries during his 286-minute stay in the middle, while Verma smacked 12 fours.         
	Sayan Sekhar Mondal, Bengals third specialist seamer who made his Ranji debut in the last match against Baroda, hardly got to roll his arm as he bowled only three overs.         
	Stand-in captain Manoj Tiwary was, no doubt, looking to the spinners to trouble the middle-order but Lahiri and left-arm spinner Shibsagar Singh were dealt with very well by Pawan and Verma.         
	Part-timer Abhishek Jhunjhunwala was brought into the attack but the offie, too, failed to make any impact. (PTI)

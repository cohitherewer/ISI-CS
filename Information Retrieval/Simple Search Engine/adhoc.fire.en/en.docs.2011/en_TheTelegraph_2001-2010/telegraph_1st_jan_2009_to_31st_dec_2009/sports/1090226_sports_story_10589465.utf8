The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Henry earns Barcelona 1-1 draw
                                                   Henry earns Barcelona 1-1 draw
                      
	London: Barcelona settled for a 1-1 draw at Olympique Lyon and Arsenal produced the only victory of the night, 1-0 at home to Roma thanks to a Robin van Persie penalty, in the Champions League on Tuesday.         
	Barcelona needed an untidy goal from Thierry Henry to take a slim advantage from the first leg of their last-16 tie against Lyon. Porto twice came from behind to draw 2-2 at Atletico Madrid.         
	Barcelonas elegant passing game, similar to the one that took Spain to victory at Euro 2008, has been the envy of Europe this season but their form has deserted them lately and they made another jittery start against Lyon.         
	The French side took the lead from a source familiar to anyone following the Champions League down the years, as the games leading set-piece specialist Juninho deceived Victor Valdes with a dipping free kick from the left.         
	Barcelona were terrible in the first half and Karim Benzema came within a whisker of making it 2-0 but they improved after the break and got a deserved equaliser when French striker Henry stooped to head in a deflected corner.         
	The away goal gave Barcelona, twice former champions, a slim advantage to take to the Nou Camp in two weeks.         
	We missed our chance in the first half, when we should have been rewarded for our efforts but we gave everything, said Lyon coach Claude Puel.(In the return leg) we will have opportunities.         
	Arsenal were the only winners but it should have been a more commanding victory.         
	They had to be content with the penalty from Van Persie, which the Dutchman won himself when he was bundled over by French defender Philippe Mexes after 37 minutes.         
	Goals were plentiful in Madrid, where Atletico and twice former champions Porto fought out a thriller.         
	Atletico hit the ground running, Maxi Rodriguez giving them the lead in the third minute before Lisandro Lopez burst through to put the Portuguese side level. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Owners okay with decision
                                                   Owners okay with decision
            OUR CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Mumbai: The Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise owners and representatives said Sunday they have no problem with the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias (BCCI) decision to shift the cash-rich Twenty20 league out of the country as the general elections are much more important. Although a few of them were disappointed that the Indian fan will be denied a first-hand experience of the cricketing spectacle, they were unanimous on the decision to go ahead with the tournament this year, even at the cost of its being held abroad.         
	If there was any resentment with the Union and the state governments over their unwillingness to provide security during the event, the owners hardly showed it. The elections are paramount, they all agreed.         
	To the possibility that this time around, given the shift, the buzz around the event would be not as strong as last year, the owners said that they would have to do with whatever interest is generated by television coverage.         
	The following is what they had to say (alphabetically)               
	Nita Ambani (co-owner, Mumbai Indians): We (franchisees) had left it to the government and the IPL. We had said that we would go whichever way they decide.         
	Manoj Badale (chairman, Rajasthan Royals): The news that we received at the owners conference is disappointing, given the huge anticipation and excitement that exists for the IPL in India. However, if the choice is between no tournament and the tournament in another country, then we clearly prefer the latter. The locations and options presented are all viable, and we are working closely with the IPL as they formulate a decision over the next 24 hours.         
	Shah Rukh Khan (principal owner, Kolkata Knight Riders): We have to respect the elections in the country. That is a bigger issue than ours. By shifting the IPL abroad, we have tried to find a solution to the problem. Of course the local buzz wouldnt be as strong as it is here but I guess elections will take care of the buzz. We dont know the financial issues. It is a television-based game and Im sure sponsors will stick together. All eight of us as team owners have decided to stick together. I will try to be there for as many matches as possible. Hopefully the schedule will help me.         
	Vijay Mallya (owner, Royal Challengers Bangalore): We are happy that the tournament is being held. It is unfortunate that it is not in India despite trying to adjust the dates because of the ensuing general elections. The franchises, without exception, wanted the show to go on.         
	Preity Zinta (co-owner, Kings XI Punjab): My views are similar to that of Shah Rukhs. Elections are No.1 in the country. It is a good decision. Otherwise the tournament would not have happened. As itll be coming at primetime on television, the fans will not suffer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Schumi back to testing
                                                     Schumi back to testing
                  Michael Schumacher test drives a 2007 Ferrari model on the Mugello track, north of Florence, on Friday                     
	Rome: Michael Schumacher returned to the wheel of a Formula One car on Friday when he tested a 2007 Ferrari in the first step of his comeback.         
	The seven-time world champion is poised to fill in for injured Ferrari driver Felipe Massa at the European Grand Prix in Valencia on August 23 and will continue to race until the Brazilian is able to return.         
	Italian media said the 40-year-old, who retired at the end of 2006, had gone out for a few laps in the car at the Mugello track near Florence.         
	F1 testing is banned during the season but Schumacher is being allowed to drive an old car as he undergoes a programme of preparation to make sure he is fit to race in Valencia.         
	Meanwhile, Massas doctor says the Formula One driver will return home to Brazil on Monday.         
	Dr. Dino Altman said on Friday at the AEK hospital that Massa is in a good mood and in good shape and wants to race again as soon as possible.         
	Altman didnt reveal how long Massas full recovery would take, but said the Brazilian would not need special treatment to overcome his injuries.         
	The 28-year-old Massa underwent surgery on multiple skull fractures after he was hit in the helmet by a loose part from another car and crashed into a protective tire barrier during qualifying for Ferrari at the Hungarian Grand Prix last Saturday.

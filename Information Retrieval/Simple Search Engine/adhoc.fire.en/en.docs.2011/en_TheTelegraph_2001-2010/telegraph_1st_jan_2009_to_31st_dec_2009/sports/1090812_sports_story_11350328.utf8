  - IPL III 
  -  KKR to open versus Deccan Chargers; Ahmedabad, Vizag among 4 new venues         OUR CORRESPONDENT            Sourav Ganguly with physio Andrew Leipus during a fitness camp of the Kolkata Knight Riders, at the Eden, on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Mumbai: The 2010 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), which is to be held from March 12 to April 25, could mark the symbolic end of an era for Indian cricket as it is likely to be the last time the multi-million dollar T20 league features the Icon players.         
	The icon player status  accorded to Sachin Tendulkar (Mumbai Indians), Sourav Ganguly (Kolkata Knight Riders), Rahul Dravid (Royal Challengers Bangalore), Virender Sehwag (Delhi DareDevils) and Yuvraj Singh (Kings XI Punjab)  would not be a mandatory clause as regards squad terms from 2011.         
	There will be no icon player status from 2011 The icon status was only for two years (and was extended by another year to 2010) anyway. The franchises can retain it if they want but it would not be mandatory, IPL chairman Lalit Modi told reporters after a meeting of the IPL governing council here Tuesday.         
	The third edition will kick-off with the Kolkata Knight Riders taking on the defending champions, Deccan Chargers, in the latters home at Hyderabad with the semi-finals slated for April 21 and 22.         
	The 2010 edition will also witness a change in the controversial Strategic Time-Out (STO). The STO will now comprise two mandatory breaks of two-and-half minutes each  one to be called by the fielding captain between the sixth and tenth overs and the other by the batsmen at the crease between the 11th and the 16th overs.         
	The event would feature an extra match, a playoff for the third place on April 24, making it a total of 60 matches in 45 days.         
	Besides, the tournament will also see matches played in new venues  Nagpur (featuring Mumbai Indians), Visakhapatnam (Deccan Chargers), Ahmedabad (Rajasthan Royals) and Dharamsala (Kings XI Punjab).         
	The multi-million dollar IPL will get bigger from its fourth edition, in 2011, with two new franchises entering the fray.         
	The auction for the two new franchises would be held in January 2010. We will be floating the tenders by the end of this year. The reserve price for the new franchises will be disclosed at a later date when the tender is ready, Modi said.         
	It may be noted that the auction for the existing eight franchises in 2008 fetched $723.59 million after the IPL had set a total base price of $400 million.         
	Ahmedabad (which has returned high TV ratings in the last two editions) and Kanpur (with the backing of Anil Ambani) have been mentioned among other venues set to bid for the franchise rights.         
	More teams means more matches, and so IPL IV would witness 94 games.         
	The number of days, however, would remain the same  45. The salary caps would be revised but other restrictions like the number of foreign players, catchment area players, etc. would stay.         
	Among other decisions of the IPL governing council:         
	The rule dealing with No Objection Certificate has been modified to the effect that a player who has NOT retired from international cricket but has not been contracted by his national board would require an NOC from the respective board for two years from the time when he last played for his country.         
	Subject to the BCCI working committees approval and guidelines, those players who had availed the BCCI Amnesty Scheme would be able to play in IPL III. They would be paid a maximum of Rs 20 lakh and a minimum of Rs 8 lakh and all capped international players would have to go through an auction.         
	The IPL would discuss with the franchises and sort out the issue of shortfall in revenues incurred by the latter owing to IPL II getting shifted to South Africa.         
	The IPL will use the services of the ICC Anti-Corruption and Security Unit for the 2010 season.         
	The transfer window for IPL III would be between December 15, 2009, and January 5, 2010.

  -  Laxmans 35-ball 46 in vain               VVS Laxman in action in Hyderabad on Saturday. (PTI)                           
	Hyderabad: Alfonso Thomas (30 not out) and James Hildreth (25) pulled off a sensational one-wicket victory of the last ball for Somerset against reigning IPL champions Deccan Chargers in a Group A match of the Champions League Twenty20 tournament here Saturday.         
	Chasing 154 for victory, the English side was tottering at 99 for seven at one stage, but Thomas and Hildreth snatched victory from the jaws of defeat by raising a superb 50-run stand for the eighth wicket.         
	Somerset required five runs from the last over, bowled by Scott Styris, and what followed was a heart-stopping drama.         
	Styris bowled Hildreth with the first ball to break the partnership and dismissed Max Waller of the third ball. Thomas dispatched a full toss for a four to level the scores, played a dot ball and smashed another boundary, an inside out shot, to seal a thrilling win for his team.         
	Thomas unbeaten knock came off just 17 balls and contained four boundaries and a six.         
	Earlier, sent in to bat, VVS Laxman hit a brilliant 46 at the top and Venugopal Rao sizzled with a fiery 22 down the order to guide the hosts to a competitive 153 for nine.         
	RP Singh (3/17) polished off the Somerset top-order in a fiery opening spell to give the hosts the kind of start they needed to defend their modest total.         
	The left-arm pacer first dismissed Marcus Trescothick (14) and then broke a 34-run second wicket partnership between Justin Langer (15) and Zander de Bruyn (19) by sending back the latter.         
	Two balls later, RP dismissed skipper Langer, causing ripples in the rival camp.         
	The Deccan Chargers spinners Pragyan Ojha (2/20) and T Suman (2/15) bowled well as they stifled the Somerset middle-order with some good bowling.         
	Somerset were staring at defeat having lost seven wickets before getting past the 100-run mark, but Hildreth and Aflonso batted superbly to bring their team back in the match.         
	Earlier, the IPL-II winners suffered a middle-order collapse to squander a breezy start but managed to put on a fighting total on a batting friendly wicket.         
	Laxman, who opened the innings with Adam Gilchrist, played brilliantly during his 35-ball knock and struck seven elegant fours. Coming at No. 7, Rao played a crucial 12-ball cameo to help his team get past the 150-run mark.         
	Deccan looked headed for a massive score at one stage but wickets fell regularly and that put paid to their hopes. Rohit Sharma made 24.         
	Ben Phillips took three wickets while Peter Trego and Alfonso took two wickets apiece for Somerset and were backed by some electric fielding.         
	Laxman began in a brilliant fashion, hitting Charl Willoughby for two boundaries in the very first over.         
	The left-handed Gilchrist also chose Willoughby for some special treatment as he fetched 17 runs from his next over by hitting two fours and clearing the ropes once at mid-wicket.         
	The IPL-II champions were off to an explosive start and crowd was on its feet, cheering every run scored.         
	Gilchrist went for a big shot off Alfonso Thomas but miscued his pull and ended up in the hands of Trescothick.           (PTI)

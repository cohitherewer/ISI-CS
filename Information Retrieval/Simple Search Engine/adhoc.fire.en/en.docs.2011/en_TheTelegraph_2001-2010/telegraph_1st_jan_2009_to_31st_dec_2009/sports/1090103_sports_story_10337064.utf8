                                                     Three Indians in Hall of Fame
            A STAFF REPORTER                      {From top)Bishan Singh Bedi, Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev                             
	Calcutta: Indian cricketing legends Bishan Singh Bedi, Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Devwere among 55 former players named on Friday in the International Cricket Councils (ICC) inaugural Hall of Fame list.         
	The Hall of Fame was launched in association with the Federation of International Cricketers Associations (FICA), as part of the ICCs centenary year celebrations.         
	ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said the initiative would provide the chance for the game to recognise its greatest achievers.         
	Given that a key theme of the ICCs centenary year is celebrating the games heritage, the foundation of the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame is an entirely logical step, he said.         
	It will provide a means of recognising the historical contribution of past players, officials and even institutions in making cricket what it is today, a great sport with a great spirit, he added.         
	Gavaskar said it was an honour to be named among so many greats.         
	To be recognised by the premier authority in the game, the ICC, and that, too, in its centenary year, is an honour indeed.         
	It is a privilege and I am overwhelmed and humbled to be included in such august company as Sir Donald Bradman and the one and only Sir Garry Sobers, the former Indian captain said in a statement.         
	Former Australia captain and India coach Greg Chappell said: Like many other youngsters growing up in Australia, I dreamed of emulating the feats of my boyhood heroes Neil Harvey, Richie Benaud, Norman Neill, Ray Lindwall and the greatest cricketer in my time, Sir Garfield Sobers, so, to be recognised alongside some of the greats of the game is a great honour.         
	Pakistan World Cup-winning captain Imran Khan said: Its kind of an icing on the cake for having a good career. I am truly honoured to have been included with icons from the older generation and stalwarts from my era.         
	Each year, starting 2009, new inductees will be announced during the LG ICC awards ceremony.         
	The initial inductees or, in the case of those who have passed away, their relatives will be presented with a commemorative ICC Cricket Hall of Fame cap at an appropriate stage during the ICC centenary year. The living members of the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame will also have the chance to choose new inductees.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Success leads the charge
                                                                                                               Success leads the charge 
            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: The RCTCs stand members wished they were barred entry at the racecourse gates on Sunday, the opening one of the winter season. The afternoons eight-event card was totally ruled by friendless winners, leaving most of the punters in a state of shock.           
	The re-introduction of a strict dress-code  jacket with a necktie for men  took a majority of the members by surprise. Members protest, however, got them the entry but with a warning that there will be no such concession in the future meetings.          
	The divine warning was ignored and punters got what they deserved minutes later when trainer Jasbir Singhs 88-1 shot, St Moritz, scored a start-to-finish victory in the days opener, the Silver Balm Handicap. The rule of outsiders continued until jockey Neeraj Rawal guided the half-money favourite, Snowden to an easy victory in the Ich Dien Cup.           
	Rawal, in fact, was the saviour for punters. He also guided Sephora, in the Adelina Handicap (Div-I). The Harvinder Singh Bath-trained horse was the only other favourite to win.          
	The main event followed the afternoons trend. Trainer Rutherford Alfords Solid Success (apprentice Srinivas Rao-up) lifted the trophy. The champion apprentice, who has changed the fortune of the stable, rode a well-judged race  keeping the four-year-old in an iron-grip till 300m from home before making his winning bid.          
	 The trophy was presented by Lawrence Fownes who trained in the city with remarkable success before shifting base to Hong Kong about three decades ago. Fownes is on a private visit to the city.          
	Trainer John Stephens Italian Star and Errol Bhungards Island Warrior turned out to be the giant-killers. They had an easy measure of the piping hot favourites  Accessor and Royal Dance  in their respective events.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Confident India wary of complacency

	Colombo: A confident India will aim to wrap up the five-match series when they take on Sri Lanka in the third one-dayer on Tuesday.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhonis men have been on target in the first two matches but the Indian captain would be taking no chances under floodlights after India just about managed a victory in a nail-biting finish at the Premadasa Stadium on Saturday.         
	Dhoni, who has now led the team to seven successive ODI wins, warned his teammates against complacency.         
	A few chinks were noticed in the Indian ranks in the second match when bowlers looked confused during the powerplay overs. Naturally, Dhoni wants a more disciplined show from his bowlers.         
	Dhoni, who is known for his calm composure, lost his cool when he saw bowlers struggling with their rhythm in the powerplay overs during the second ODI. It was tough and we did not have such a game for a long time, Dhoni said.         
	It is unlikely that Laxmipathy Balaji, who replaced the injured Munaf Patel, will play.         
	Although Indian batsmen did not fall prey to Sri Lankan spin wizards Muttiah Muralidharan and Ajantha Mendis, they struggled to hit boundaries against the duo.         
	We have to be careful as such wins often make us a bit relaxed. We should remember that the series is yet to be won. We want to win the series and for that each of us have to give 100 per cent, Dhoni said.         
	For a jaded looking Sri Lanka, it is a must win situation and they would be desperate to keep the series alive by clinching a win in the third match.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhutia: Not surprised by AFCs diktat 
                                                     Bhutia: Not surprised by AFCs diktat 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bhaichung Bhutia                           
	New Delhi: Top coaches in India should work out ways to get more exposure at the international level and improve their knowledge of the game, according to Indian captain Bhaichung Bhutia.         
	 Talking to The Telegraph on Thursday, Bhaichung said the recent ruling by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) that no coach without an AFC A License should be allowed to coach an I-League side was expected.         
	 All of us knew it was coming. There is no surprise element in it, said Bhaichung. Thats the way modern football is played all over the world.         
	 Indian coaches should go to other countries more often to obtain advanced coaching degrees, Bhaichung noted. Otherwise they wont be able to refresh their knowledge.         
	 Bhaichung agreed that the AFC decision was a little harsh on some of the experienced coaches in India. AFC should have set a deadline for the coaches to obtain necessary degrees. There also should not be any age bar on them.         
	 Bhaichung, who has been playing for India for 15 years, the last 10 years as the captain, said the current side was perhaps the best organised ever.         
	 Looking back at my career, sometimes I feel the team we had in 1997 was the best as we had some great individual players like IM Vijayan, Jo Paul Ancheri, Carlton Chapman, Bruno Coutinho and Godfred Pereira. Given a chance I would like all of them to come back into the present side.         
	 But then, as far as the duty and discipline are concerned the current set of players is the best as a team. These boys are certainly in a better frame of mind as international footballers, said Bhaichung.         
	 Most of these players are capable of playing in other countries. They are all physically fit to play outside. Only thing  they need to improve psychologically. They should play wherever they get a chance. Even a stint in UAE, Qatar or Kuwait will help our boys, said Bhaichung.         
	 Asked how long he wants to extend his international career, the Indian captain said he was looking forward to playing in the 2011 Asian Cup final rounds first.         
	It all depends on how I feel physically to carry on at the top level. I even aspire to play one more World Cup qualifiers, may be in the next three or four years. At the moment, I feel very enthusiastic and physically fit to carry on.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal wins; Bhupathi stumbles
                                                   Nadal wins; Bhupathi stumbles
                      
	Barcelona: Rafael Nadal has won his fifth straight Barcelona Open title after beating David Ferrer 6-2, 7-5.         
	Top-ranked Nadal exploited Ferrers inconsistent service game to win the first set while also overcoming his own erratic play in the second set to win the Godo trophy at his fellow Spaniards expense for the second straight year.         
	In the doubles final, Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles had to be content with the runners-up title following their defeat to the reigning ATP World Tour Champions Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjic. Bidding for their first title in six months, the fourth-seed Indo-Bahamian pair lost 3-6, 6-7(9-11) to the Canadian-Serbian pair in one hour and 33 minutes.         
	Nadal, who was coming off a record fifth straight Monte Carlos Masters title, improved to 24-1 in clay court finals to pick up his fourth title of the season. The four-time defending French Open champion goes into the Rome Masters on a 25-match unbeaten run with only three defeats in his last 133 matches on the red surface.         
	Bhupathi and Knowles were playing their second summit clash of the season after ending runners-up at Australian Open to Bryan brothers.           (AGENCIES)

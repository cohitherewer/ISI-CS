The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chidi to partner Suraj upfront
                                                     Chidi to partner Suraj upfront
            A STAFF REPORTER            Surkumar Singh                           
	Calcutta: Even before the season began, Mohun Bagan have often been in the news, thanks to their much-publicised row with India captain Bhaichung Bhutia. When they take on George Telegraph on Friday, in a group C encounter of the 114th IFA Shield, Karim Bencharifas wards will have a chance to shift their focus back to soccer.         
	For that to happen, Bagan, in the absence of the Jose Ramirez Barreto, will have to depend on a new combination upfront  Edeh Chidi and Suraj Mondal. Though Bencharifa declined to reveal his team combination on the eve of their first match of the season, Chidi and Suraj looked the preferred choice.         
	Bagans new recruit Surkumar Singh is set to don the club colours on Friday and as admitted by Bencharifa, his addition has only enhanced the quality of the side.         
	Surkumars addition is definitely a positive sign. I have two three options for each position which is a welcome problem. Its good that Im not at a loss for choice, he said.         
	Expressing confidence with the fitness of his team, Karim said: My team is in a good shape and I would go all-out for a victory. With only two group league matches to play, one cannot allow a slip as that may cost dear.         
	George Telegraph had lost their first match against Mahindra United but the Bagan coach refused to take them lightly.         
	In the other match of the day, Churchill Brothers face Lajong FC at the Barasat Stadium. Indian defender Gourmangi Singh is set to play for Churchill on Friday.

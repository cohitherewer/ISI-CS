	Paris: Sania Mirza, Indias first female Grand Slam winner in doubles, will open her French Open campaign against Kazakhstans Galina Voskoboev, ranked 95 in the world.         
	Sania, ranked 91, is expected to cross the first hurdle but the Indian can run into a really tough opponent in the second round where she could meet formidable seventh seed Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova, who is pitted against Claire Feuerstein of the host nation in her opening round.         
	Sania enjoys a 1-0 lead over Voskoboev with the Indian defeating her Kazak rival in straight sets in San Diego in 2005 in their only outing.         
	The Indian ace had skipped the last French Open, in fact the entire clay court season, due to a wrist injury.         
	Sania has never moved beyond the second round here and it will be Herculean task for her to improve her record.         
	Sania has had a wonderful start to the season as she annexed her first Grand Slam title, winning the mixed doubles title at Australian Open with compatriot Mahesh Bhupathi.         
	Meanwhile, sisters Serena and Venus Williams were placed in opposite sides of the French Open field on Friday, while the mens semi-finals could pit four-time defending champion Rafael Nadal against Andy Murray, and Roger Federer against Novak Djokovic.         
	Trying to become the first man to win five consecutive French Opens, the top-seeded Nadal will begin against a qualifier. He could meet former No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt in the third round and 14th-seeded David Ferrer in the fourth.         
	Federers bid to tie Pete Sampras record of 14 career major singles title will start against Alberto Martin of Spain.         
	The potential mens quarter finals are Nadal vs No. 8 Fernando Verdasco, Murray vs No. 7 Gilles Simon, Federer vs No. 6 Andy Roddick, and Djokovic vs No. 5 Juan Martin Del Potro.         
	The possible womens quarter finals are top-ranked Dinara Safina vs defending champion Ana Ivanovic, Venus Williams vs No. 6 Vera Zvonareva, Serena Williams vs No. 7 Svetlana Kuznetsova, and No. 4 Elena Dementieva vs No. 5 Jelena Jankovic.         
	Safina starts against Anne Keothavong of Britain.         
	The second-seeded Serena  one of two past womens champions in the draw  will meet Klara Zakopalova of the Czech Republic in the first round. The third-seeded Venus faces Bethanie Mattek-Sands of the United States in her opener.         
	The Williams sisters could only meet in the championship match.         
	Serena beat Venus in the 2002 French Open final.         
	Maria Sharapova will play Anastasiya Yakimova of Belarus in her first Grand Slam match since Wimbledon last year. Sharapova returned to the tour this week after missing nearly 10 months with a shoulder injury and is not seeded.         
	Meanwhile, Somdev Dev Varman couldnt materialise his dream of playing in the main draw of the French Open after suffering a straight sets defeat at the hands of third seed Marcos Daniel of Brazil in the final round of qualifiers, on Friday.         
	The Indian, seeded 26th in the qualifiers, surrendered 0-6, 1-6 meekly before Daniel in a one-sided affair that lasted just 58 minutes.         
	The Brazilian outclassed Somdev in every department of the game as the Indian failed to hold on to his serve for once to hand over the opening set in just 23 minutes. The 35 minute-long second set was no different as Somdev could hold his serve only once before surrendering to his fancied rival.         
	The Brazilians dominance in the match could be gauged from the fact that he registered 30 winners compared to nine from his opponent.         
	 Somdev was no where near his usual best as he failed to convert a single break point opportunity out of the five he earned in the entire match. In contrast, Daniel utilised five of the eight break points he earned.

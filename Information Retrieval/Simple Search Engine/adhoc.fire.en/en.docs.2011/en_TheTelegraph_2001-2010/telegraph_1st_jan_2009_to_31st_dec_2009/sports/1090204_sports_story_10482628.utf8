	I am quite happy with my game today But it is only the first day and theres still a long way to go, Himmat said.         
	I had a solid round today. I hit it really well and did not miss too many putts. In fact, I hit the green in two strokes on the par five 10th and 13th. On both these occasions I set up 10 feet putts for eagle.

                                                   State refs fail to make Fifa cut
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: For the first time in many years, no one from Bengal will be on the list of Fifa referees for the year 2010.         
	In the fitness test conducted by the AIFF in Jamshedpur Monday, the three Bengal referees who were in the running for a place on the prestigious list failed the tests.         
	The trio  Minaghshu Bhattacharya, Dhanapati Roy and Chaitali Pal  will not be recommended for the new Fifa list, the deadline for which expires at the end of this month.         
	When contacted, the deputy general secretary of the AIFF, Gautam Kar admitted that all three had failed to clear the tests. They were on the Fifa list for 2009 but their performance was not up to the set standard.         
	Out of the 18 at Jamshedpur, 14 have passed the tests. While Goa and Services have contributed three each, Manipur have two while Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi, Kerala and Maharashtra have one each.         
	The final list will be prepared later this month.

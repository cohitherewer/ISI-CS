The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Not sure the Knights have team spirit, self-belief: Warne
                                                     Not sure the Knights have team spirit, self-belief: Warne
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Shane Warne congratulates Kamran Khan after he dismissed Sourav Ganguly on Thursday                           
	Cape Town: After beating the Kolkata Knight Riders tactically, Shane Warne, the Rajasthan Royals captain, rubbed it in off the field.         
	He left nobody in doubt that hed been delighted with the win over a team which is cricket-wise managed by John Buchanan, with whom he had major differences during their years together in the Australia dressing room.         
	Irrespective of what else happens in IPL 2009, Warne would like to win both games against the Knight Riders, somebody who knows both told The Telegraph.         
	The following are excerpts from Warnes media conference:               
	Giving the Super Over to Kamran Khan         
	Look, even before the tournament began, Id said Ive got a lot of faith in him... Unfortunately, he got a little confused with the field, but Kamran is a star of the future... Hell learn from that Super Over. The rest of us too.         
	Options considered for that over         
	There was Yusuf (Pathan) and I thought of myself as well, but the ball was getting wet (because of dew) and spinners wouldve had a problem gripping it... Plus, Kamran had just bowled a good (20th) over and, so, was warmed-up.         
	If hed expected Ajantha Mendis to bowl the Knight Riders Super Over         
	Either Ishant Sharma or Mendis, but dew was there...         
	The Super Over concept         
	Its exciting... This match will kick-start this edition of the IPL.         
	What had been his target         
	To get 150-plus... We got 150... Our batting was pretty good and, later, I liked our intensity on the field.         
	The outcome         
	You know, both the Knight Riders and our team thought we could win... With five overs to go, Id thought wed do so quite comfortably, but (Sourav) Ganguly got it away in one over (the 16th) and that brought them right back... With only seven needed in the last over, they shouldve won from there... Im happy that we got over the line... Of course, we can improve a few things, but I think we played exceptionally... Were the champions and are a lot better than what the result (defeat at the hands of the Royal Challengers Bangalore) of our first game showed... Were here to win... In this match, wed been very good in the first 10 overs of the Knight Riders... Wed won some close ones in last years IPL and those wins helped build team spirit.         
	What helps in tight finishes         
	Team spirit and self-belief... With three-four captains, Im not sure the Knight Riders have got that!         
	Having proved that captains, not coaches, win cricket games         
	(Laughs) I believe in one captain... I also believe coaches should be there for age-group and first-class cricket (at the domestic stage)... At the international level, its the captain who runs the show and one voice as captain is the best way to go, because everybody then knows where he stands...         
	Lesson learnt         
	That one bad over (referring to the 16th, by Munaf Patel) can bring the opposition right back into the match... Also, that if you win games like this one, then you could take the tournament... Weve taken an unbelievable amount of confidence from this win.         
	Communicating with Munaf, who isnt fluent in English         
	A bit of Hindi, but mostly English... I try and speak slowly... Ive got signals for him, depending on what I want.         
	The difference which the IPL is making         
	Look, the good thing is that there are so many Indian players in each franchise and theyre getting the opportunity to mix with players from overseas... We, foreigners, can help develop Indian players and thereby help Indian cricket.         
	Finally, his approach as the Royals captain         
	To get the players to think... To help them become the best they can be... Im backing my players to back their own skills. If it doesnt work, it doesnt work, but theyll still be learning from tough situations... If you hide them, they wont learn.

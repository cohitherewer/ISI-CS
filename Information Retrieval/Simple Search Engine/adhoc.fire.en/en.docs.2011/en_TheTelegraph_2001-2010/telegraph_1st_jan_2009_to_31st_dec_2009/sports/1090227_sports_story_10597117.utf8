                                                   Familiar faces, unfamiliar turf
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Its not quite a contest of titanic proportions, but when the two teams have illustrious coaches whose reputation is second to none, the clash takes a different meaning altogether.         
	As Hindustan Club play Indian Nationals at the Ambedkar Stadium for the Delhi Soccer Association (DSA) title on Friday, it would be no less than a fight between two former coaches of East Bengal and Mohun Bagan  Manoranjan Bhattacharya and Nigerian Bernard Oparanozie.         
	Another star footballer-turned-coach of the Calcutta Maidan  Chima Okerie  is also plying his trade in the capital. Under the former Mohun Bagan coach, New Delhi Heroes have finished fourth in the DSA Championship and are currently gearing up to play in the Second Division I-League.         
	None of the three coaches were ready to accept that they had to come to Delhi after being discarded by the big Calcutta clubs.         
	The new assignment has done me a world of good, said Manoranjan. I got an opportunity to prove myself as a coach. It was not easy to take Hindustan Club to the final.         
	The former India captain conceded he took time to adjust to the conditions here. Compared to Calcutta, football in Delhi hardly gets any media coverage. The system here also lacks professionalism. Delhi football will have to go a long way before it can match with Calcutta or Goa .         
	Chima, who is camping in the capital for the past two seasons, said he was happy coaching the Delhi club. I do miss Calcuttas crowd, he admitted. But I dont miss Calcutta football. In Calcutta, everyone knows football. They dont want to learn, he said.         
	Bernard said that as a professional coach he was happy to take any assignment in any city.

	Colombo: Sri Lanka Test captain Kumar Sangakkara has told his players to concentrate on their game instead of complaining about conditions during their upcoming tour of India.         
	The attitude should be simple. The first thing we should start with is no complaints with anything, Kumar Sangakkara said on Thursday.         
	He said the players should focus on things within their control rather than complaining about the pitches, weather or food when Sri Lanka travel to India for three Test matches, five one-day internationals and two Twenty20 games next month.         
	Sangakkara said he expects the tour to be very exciting and also a daunting task, with Sri Lanka yet to win a Test in India. Sri Lanka have lost eight of the 14 Tests they have played in India.         
	According to him the principal factor for his teams poor form in the ODI in the last few years is mainly due to an inconsistent batting line up.         
	The biggest let-down we had is our batting.         
	We suffered because we had lots of batting position changes up and down the order, Sangakkara said.         
	For the batting to improve you must give the players the confidence. They must know what role they are supposed to play. Role identification has been a big problem.         
	Except for the openers no one knew what their role was in the side.         
	We have never clicked in all departments those are things the team ignored for a while.         
	The players have now started to realise that they take a lot of pride not just representing the country but to be up to the task that is required of them by the team, he reasoned.         
	Talking about Sri Lankas new fielding coach, Gavin Fingleson, a former Olympic baseball player, Sangakkara said: He (Gavin) didnt come and change but showed us how do things right.         
	He showed us little points that will make us better and quick fielders, at the same time we also realised to be quicker on the field youve got to be fitter as a side.         
	We started doing a lot of work on fitness running. Gavin showed us a lot of drills and how you can gain that extra second advantage when going for a catch or trying to stop the ball.         
	At the same time the most important point was to make sure at practice you do everything as perfectly, those are the habits we have to build on.         
	Meanwhile, Sangakkara also said veteran opening batsman Sanath Jayasuriya will drop down the batting order in the one-day Internationals to allow left-handed batsman Upul Tharanga to open with Tillakaratne Dilshan.         
	The 40-year-old Jayasuriya has opened batting in 387 of his 441 ODIs, scoring 12,738 runs as an opener with an average of 34. (Agencies)

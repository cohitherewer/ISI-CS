The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Haddin may miss rest of Ashes series
                                                   Haddin may miss rest of Ashes series
                      
	Birmingham: A fractured finger just before the third Test has cast a shadow on Australian wicket-keeper Brad Haddins participation in the rest of the Ashes series with coach Tim Nielsel saying keeping wickets in such a condition may further aggravate his injury.         
	Nielsen said Haddin is in doubt for at least the fourth Test at Leeds, which starts next week, and the team was waiting for more information on the glovemans prognosis from a specialist in Australia.         
	Haddin fractured his finger just minutes before the start of the third Test in almost the same spot where Glenn McGrath sprained his ankle during the warmup for the corresponding game four summers ago.         
	He was catching the fast bowlers at the end of the warm up. Knowing we were batting, he stayed out to catch a few extra balls, one dipped a bit and hit him on the end of the left ring finger and hes got a fracture in the last part of his finger, Nielsen said.         
	Well send the pictures off to Australia tonight. When the doc had a look, it was unstable, a real risk that if he played it was broken worse. Wed have to be careful looking at the fourth Test, but we dont know, he added.         
	Haddin wanted to play in the third Test but was told that he would need to take regular injections and also risked a more serious injury.         
	We were concerned if he was going to play he would have had to have it injected pretty much every session because it was a pretty significant crack. The other issue is its a fracture at the moment, so healing will be better than if its totally broken off.

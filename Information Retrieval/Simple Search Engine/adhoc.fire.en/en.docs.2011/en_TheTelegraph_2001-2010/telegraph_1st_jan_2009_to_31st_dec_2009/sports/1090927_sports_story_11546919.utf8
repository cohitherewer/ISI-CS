The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lanka eye a turnaround 
                                                   Lanka eye a turnaround 
                      
	Johannesburg: Sri Lanka, after their Friday loss to England, would be aiming to revive their Champions Trophy campaign back on track against a struggling New Zealand in their final Group B match Sunday.         
	In a group where hosts South Africa and the consistent Lankans were seen as favourites to qualify for the semi-finals, the race to the last-four stage has been thrown wide open after Englands win Friday night.         
	Sri Lanka beat South Africa in a rain-hit opener before being upstaged by the inspired Englishmen on a seam-friendly track. A win Sunday would put them back in contention for a semi-final spot.         
	On the other hand, New Zealand would be looking for their first win of the meet. Beaten by South Africa, the Black Caps will have to raise their game by several notches to get the better of Kumar Sangakkaras men. The Lankans boast of a solid batting line-up, which had a rare bad day in office against England, while the bowling has a lot of variety to offer.         
	Sanath Jayasuriya, dismissed for a naught Friday night, would be aiming for a big knock. The likes of Tillekaratne Dilshan, Mahela Jayawardene and Sangakkara himself would be relishing the opportunity of having a go at the Black Caps attack, which they had taken to the cleaners in a home series.         
	Bowling has been Sri Lankas major strength and Ajantha Mendis and Co. would be expected to continue with fine form. The Black Caps, in contrast, have been struggling for long in batting. If batting has been a let down, the bowling hasnt been any good either. Lot was expected from comeback man Shane Bond but he hasnt quite made an impact so far.         
	In Vettori, the Black Caps have one of the best spinners in the world and though he has done his job well, he cant come up with solo winning efforts all the time.

                                                   Dhoni best captain in world now: Wadekar
                      
	New Delhi: Former India captain Ajit Wadekar feels Mahendra Singh Dhoni is the best leader in world cricket at the moment and that he will surpass Sourav Ganguly as the most successful Indian captain.         
	Wadekar, under whose captaincy India won their first series in England and the West Indies back in 1971, feels Dhoni will break all records of Indian captaincy.         
	The Indian team is lucky to have a captain like him. He is the best captain in the world at the moment. He knows how to get the best out of the team and leads from the front. He is very cool and has tremendous faith in his decisions, Wadekar said.         
	The former chief selector said Dhoni will eventually surpass Sourav as Indias most successful captain.         
	Definitely Dhoni will become the most successful Indian captain soon. He will break the record set by Sourav, he said. He does not believe in giving big statements. He is well balanced in dealing with media, Wadekar added. The former India captain said the current Indian team has what it takes to clinch the 2011 World Cup to be held in the sub-continent.         
	This team has got a lot of young blood. It has won matches without senior players. In fact, for the first time in the history of Indian cricket we have a balanced team. It has great pacers and spinners, an equally good batting line up and fielders. I think this team has a chance to win the World Cup, he said.         
	We are defeating the champions in every format of the game. We have pacers and batters who performed well everywhere including Australia. No one should have any doubts on the their capabilities now, he added.

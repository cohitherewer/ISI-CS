The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Douanes do all but win
                                                   Douanes do all but win
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Senegalese club AS Douanes displayed good skills and dominated the game throughout, but could only manage one point after they were held to a goalless draw by Air India in their group D IFA Shield match, at the Howrah Stadium on Wednesday.         
	With tall, lanky and athletic footballers, Dounaes maintained supremacy from the early minutes of the match.         
	Their aggressive game pushed the airmen on to the back foot and they launched back-to-back forays at the Air India goal. However, it was their poor finish that let them down as they squandered chance after chance.         
	While Ibrahima Faye missed with only Air India custodian Arnab Das Sharma to beat, Landing Sani Aiaha headed out to squander another opportunity in a match that witnessed nothing but rough football. At the final whistle Air India had earned six yellow cards.         
	The Senegalese almost took the lead in the 35th minute. It was a free-kick awarded just outside the top-box after Yaba Mboup was brought down by Ravinder Singh. Pape Kaly Kowe took the shot but his fiery left-footer missed the target.         
	In the 49th minute, a Soccor Velho free-kick from the right had Senegal goalkeeper Issa Haiaye completely foxed as it fell to an unmarked N. Dbuisi Opara on the left. The Nigerian forward had been off-colour in this match, and could only head it out of play.

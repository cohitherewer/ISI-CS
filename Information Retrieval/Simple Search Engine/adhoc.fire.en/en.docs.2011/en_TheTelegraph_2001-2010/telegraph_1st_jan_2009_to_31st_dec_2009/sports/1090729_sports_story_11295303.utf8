The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Visitors eager to avenge defeat
                                                   Visitors eager to avenge defeat
                      
	Dambulla: Pakistan are banking on a fresh set of players to deliver in the one-day International series starting here on Thursday.         
	The visitors would look to avenge their defeat in the Test series. Pakistan were beaten in a Test series for the first time on Sri Lankan soil when Younis Khans men lost the first two matches before drawing the final game in Colombo last week.         
	But Younis is confident that a change in personnel and infusion of fresh blood for the five one-dayers will revive the tourists and provide entertaining cricket for fans.         
	There are many players in the team who did not play the Test series, and they are keen to prove that Pakistan are one of the best one-day teams in the world, he said.         
	The Tests are behind us, we look forward to doing well in the one-dayers, said Younis, who led Pakistan to victory over Sri Lanka in the World Twenty20 final at Lords in June.         
	Shahid Afridi returns to bolster the tourists after opting out of the Test series.         
	Pakistan will also welcome back seamer Rana Naved-ul Hasan, 31, and opening batsman Imran Nazir, 27, who will represent the country once again after breaking links with the unauthorised Indian Cricket League (ICL).         
	All eyes, however, will be on talented 19-year-old batsman Umar Akmal, the younger brother of wicketkeeper Kamran, who forced his way into the side with impressive scores in domestic cricket.         
	Umar hit an unbeaten 101 in a warm-up match in Kurunegala on Monday when Pakistan failed to chase down Sri Lanka As 348 for six by just 15 runs.         
	Sri Lanka, meanwhile, will be boosted by the return of Muttiah Muralidharan and fiery fast bowler Lasith Malinga, after they both missed the Test series with knee injuries.         
	Thilan Samaraweera returns to the one-day arena after four years, but dashing Tillekeratne Dilshan will miss the series after sustaining finger and eye injuries during the third Test. Upul Tharanga is expected to open the innings with Sanath Jayasuriya.

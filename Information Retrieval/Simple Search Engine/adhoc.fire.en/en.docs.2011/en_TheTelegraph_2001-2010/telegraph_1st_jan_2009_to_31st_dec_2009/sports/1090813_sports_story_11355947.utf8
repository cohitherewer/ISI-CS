	Baku: Bastian Schweinsteiger and Miroslav Klose scored a goal in each half Wednesday to help Germany beat a spirited Azerbaijan 2-0 in a World Cup qualifier and take a four-point lead in Group C.         
	Germany only have one match left to play, but second-place Russia could still deny the Germans an automatic place in next years finals in South Africa because they have a game in hand.         
	Schweinsteigers goal came in the 12th minute after the Bayern Munich midfielder cut in from the right and fired a left-foot shot from the edge of the area that ricocheted off a defender into the top left corner of the goal.         
	Azerbaijan goalkeeper Farhad Valiyev got a glove to the ball but it wasnt enough.         
	Klose doubled the lead in the 54th by heading home a rebound, after Mario Gomez skillfully beat a defender and struck the crossbar with a left-foot shot on the turn.         
	Germany can secure qualification with a win when they host Azerbaijan on Sept. 9.         
	Andre-Pierre Gignac scored his first international goal Wednesday as France laboured to a 1-0 win at the Faroe Islands in a Cup qualifier match.         
	Gignac scored in the 42nd minute when he collected a pass from Florent Malouda just inside the penalty area, spun quickly and placed a low shot into the bottom left corner.         
	France have 13 points from six matches, bringing it to within five points of Group 7 leader Serbia. But it was far from a convincing performance from Raymond Domenechs team, which has to play Romania and Serbia next month.         
	Its always the same problem, you have to score. We created enough chances, Domenech said.         
	I said before the match that only the three points matter, so Im not going to start moaning now.         
	France host Romania at Stade de France on September 5 and play Serbia in Belgrade four days later. The crucial double header could decide whether or not France finish in first place and qualify directly for the 2010 World Cup.         
	In Russia, Argentina overcame the absence of injured Lionel Messi to beat Russia 3-2 in a friendly and take some pressure off coach Diego Maradona.         
	Messi was ruled out after he pulled a muscle in a training session on the eve of the game. Igor Semshov fired Russia ahead in the 17th minute at the Lokomotiv Stadium, only for Sergio Aguero to level with a 20-metre drive in the final minute of the first half.         
	The second half was less than a minute old when substitute Lisandro Lopez gave Argentina a 2-1 lead, and Jesus Datolo added a third with a long-range left-foot shot in the 59th. Roman Pavlyuchenko made it 3-2 with a deflected free kick.         
	Maradona had initially objected to the match being played, fearing injuries ahead of a crucial World Cup qualifier against Brazil on Sept. 5, and said Messi was rested as a precaution.         
	We will not risk Messi for a single minute, Maradona said.         
	Even if a single player is injured, it will make Brazils life easier.         
	At Teplice, Milan Baros converted a penalty to help hosts Czech Republic rally for a 3-1 win over Belgium in a friendly. Baros gave the Czechs a 2-1 lead when he scored from the spot in the 41st minute, after Belgian defender Daniel van Buyten fouled Vaclav Sverkos in the area.         
	David Rozehnal secured the win from close range in the 78th after Belgian defence failed to clear a corner kick.         
	Jan Vertonghen had put the visitors ahead in the 12th minute with a left-footed swerving drive, before Roman Hubnik headed in an equaliser 15 minutes later.         
	In Seoul, Park Chu-young came off the bench to score a late goal to give South Korea a 1-0 win over Paraguay in a friendly. The Monaco winger collected the rebound after goalkeeper Justo Villar had deflected a close-range shot and fired the ball into the top corner in the 83rd minute.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Easy victory for Sri Lanka
                                                   Easy victory for Sri Lanka
                      
	Dambulla: Sri Lanka cruised to a 2-0 series lead with a comfortable six-wicket victory against Pakistan in the second one-day International on Saturday.         
	Left-arm pace bowler Thilan Thushara claimed three wickets as Sri Lanka bowled out Pakistan for a below-par 168 in 47 overs.         
	Sri Lanka made a shaky start, collapsing to 44 for three after the loss of Upul Tharanga (10), Sanath Jayasuriya (30) and Kumar Sangakkara (2), but eventually won with 6.2 overs to spare.         
	The hosts were guided home by middle-order batsman Chamara Kapugedera, who top-scored with a stylish 67 not out from 97 balls with eight fours and one six.         
	Thilan Samaraweera gave him solid support with 38 from 69 balls.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Do-or-die match for India
                                                   Do-or-die match for India
                      
	Kuantan (Malaysia): Defending champions India will be under tremendous pressure and will have to come out all guns blazing when they take on China in their do-or-die last pool match of the Asia Cup hockey tournament here on Tuesday.         
	Stung by their first loss to Pakistan after the 2006 Commonwealth Games, India face a must-win situation against the nimble-footed Chinese as even a draw will show them the exit door from the event with China progressing to the semi-finals from Pool B as the second best team alongwith Pakistan. With a draw against China in their opening match and then Sundays 3-2 victory over India, Pakistan have already booked their place in the last four stage as the group toppers.

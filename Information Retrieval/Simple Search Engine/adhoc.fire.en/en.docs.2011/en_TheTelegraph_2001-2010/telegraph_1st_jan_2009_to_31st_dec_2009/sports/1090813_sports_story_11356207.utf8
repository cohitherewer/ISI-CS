	Colombo: Pakistan clinched a 52-run victory over Sri Lanka in a one-off Twenty20 International to finish their losing tour on a high on Wednesday.         
	Pakistan, who lost the Test series 2-0 and the ODI series 3-2, dominated the match with skipper Shahid Afridi guiding his team to a competitive 172 for five in 20 overs.         
	Sri Lanka, cheered on by capacity crowd, stayed in contention until skipper Kumar Sangakkara was bowled by off spinner Saeed Ajmal for 38 from 31 balls.         
	The fall of Sangakkara triggered a middle-order collapse as the run-rate rocketed. The hosts losing four wickets for 15 runs before being bowled out for 120 in 18.1 overs. Ajmal was the pick of the Pakistan bowlers, claiming three for 18 from his four overs. Pacer Naved-ul-Hasan took three for 19.

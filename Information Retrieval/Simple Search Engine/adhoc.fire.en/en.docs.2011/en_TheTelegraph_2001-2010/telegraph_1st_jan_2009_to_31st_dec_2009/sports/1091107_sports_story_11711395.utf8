The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brendon century vs Pak 
                                                                                                                                   Brendon century vs Pak 
                      
	Abu Dhabi: Opener Brendon McCullum returned to form with a brilliant hundred to guide New Zealand to an imposing 303 for eight in the second ODI against Pakistan Friday.         
	The 27-year-old right-handed batsman scored 131 for his second one-day hundred and added 126 for the second wicket with Martin Guptill (62) after the Black Caps won the toss and decided to bat in a must-win match.         
	New Zealand, who lost the first match by 138 runs to trail 0-1 in the three-match series, had McCullum to thank for salvaging the innings after Aaron Redmond (six) fell in the sixth over, caught off pacer Mohammed Aamir.         
	Stripped of the vice-captaincy last month to allow him to concentrate on batting, McCullum steadied the innings, driving and cutting with authority during his 129-ball knock. He hit 14 boundaries and three sixes.         
	Guptill, declared New Zealands best one-day player last month, matched his partner shot for shot, hitting five boundaries and two sixes during his 70-ball knock before holing out to pacer Abdul Razzaq.         
	Leg-spinner Shahid Afridi, Man-of-the-Match in Pakistans 138-run win in the first match, removed Ross Taylor for a duck before Scot Styris was run out for nine runs as Pakistan hit back to reduce their rivals to 160 for four.         
	McCullum and Daniel Vettori (30) added 44 for the fifth wicket before Razzaq returned for his second spell to have the New Zealand captain caught behind off a miscued hit.         
	McCullum, whose previous hundred (166) was made against Ireland at Aberdeen last year, reached his three-figure mark off 108 deliveries. He was finally dismissed in the 47th over, bowled off an inside edge by Umar Gul. He also added 56 for the seventh wicket with Oram who made 33 not out.

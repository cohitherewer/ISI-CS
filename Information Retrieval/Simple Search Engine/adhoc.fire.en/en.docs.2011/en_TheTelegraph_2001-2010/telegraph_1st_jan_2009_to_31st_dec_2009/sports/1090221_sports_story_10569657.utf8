                                                     Shukla amp; Co. keen to keep clean slate
            A STAFF REPORTER            Laxmi Ratan Shukla                           
	Calcutta: Bengal will eye a clean state when they lock horns with Orissa in their last league match of the East Zone National One-dayers for the Vijay Hazare Trophy, Saturday.         
	Bengal will have to beat Orissa, arguably the strongest among the home teams opponents, to top the group from the East Zone.         
	The hosts, though, are already through to the next stage of the tournament.         
	Bengal are currently on 14 points from three matches, while Orissa have garnered nine points from two matches.         
	The hosts will be bolstered by the return of Sourav Ganguly in the team. Sourav, who has already retired from international and first-class cricket, skipped the last match against Tripura owing to personal reasons.         
	Souravs return, however, has posed a problem for the Bengal selection committee. Sreevats Goswami, who came in for Sourav in the match against Tripura, played a useful knock of 74 and will, thus, retain his place in the team.         
	The axe might come down either on middle-order batsman Debabrata Das or Dibyendu Chakrabarty to accommodate Sourav. Till late on Friday, Debabrata was likely to be retained his place in the team.         
	Debabrata had the chance to bat only once in the tournament and scored 25 runs while Dibyendu managed only 23 and 12 in the two innings he batted in.         
	A decision will be taken in the morning. But as of now, Debabrata is a bit better-placed to play tomorrow, a source close to the selection committee said.         
	However, Bengal coach Utpal Chatterjee claimed that the toss-up would be between opener Abhisek Banerjee and Sreevats.         
	Orissa match will be tougher. Were looking at a harder performance against them tomorrow, captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla said.         
	The Bengal team, who played their last match on Thursday, decided to skip practice on Friday.         
	TEAMS         
	Bengal (likely): Wriddhiman Saha, Abhisek Banerjee, Sourav Ganguly, Manoj Tiwary, Laxmi Ratan Shukla (captain), Sreevats Goswami, Debabrata Das/Dibyendu Chakrabarty, Avik Chowdhury, Ashok Dinda, Ranadeb Bose, Iresh Saxena.

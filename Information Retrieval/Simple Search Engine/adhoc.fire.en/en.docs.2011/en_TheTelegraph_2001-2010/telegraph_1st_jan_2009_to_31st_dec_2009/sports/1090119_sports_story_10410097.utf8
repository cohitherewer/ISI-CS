The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Was hopeful of getting the call: Ravindra
                                                   Was hopeful of getting the call: Ravindra
                      
	Rajkot: Ravindra Jadeja, after his selection for the upcoming one-day International series against Sri Lanka, said he had been hopeful of getting the call after a great Ranji season.         
	India will play five ODIs and one Twenty20 International in the island country.         
	After such a good Ranji season I hoped my name would be in the reckoning, Jadeja said after learning of his selection.         
	Jadejas 42 wickets makes him the joint leading wicket-taker along with Mumbais Dhawal Kulkarni. He finished sixth on the run-charts, with 739 at an average of 67.18.         
	The promising allrounder talking from hometown Jamnagar sounded confident of playing a positive role and getting the winning momentum going if given an opportunity in the final XI.         
	I have been selected for the Indian team and I will try my level best to do well, the 20-year old said.         
	It is a great moment for me to be selected in the national team and I will give more than hundred per cent to prove my selection.         
	I look at myself as an allrounder and I am confident I can score those 50-60 runs in the middle order and play my hand with the ball and take a few quick wickets in the middle overs, he added.         
	Jadeja, who played for the Rajasthan Royals in the inaugural Indian Premier League (IPL) last year, said he had been lucky to get a chance to play with legendary international cricketers.         
	I was lucky to play in the IPL. Its a great platform for young players like me.         
	Playing with the likes of Shane Warne was really a great opportunity for me, Jadeja said.         
	He also gave full credit to his parents, family members, and coaches, Mahendrasinh Chauhan and Debu Mitra.         
	Jadeja will become the second player from Saurashtra to play ODI cricket after right-arm off-spinner, Ashok Patel in 1980. Patel is now chief coach of Gujarats Ranji Trophy team.

                                                   Better form, team spirit give East Zone the edge
  - Deodhar Trophy 
  -   Star-studded west not at their best         A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                                        Manoj Tiwary      
	Cuttack: West Zone boast of a star-studded line-up and appear favourites but East Zones current form gives them the edge as the two teams gear up for Wednesdays final of the Zonal One-Dayers for the Deodhar Trophy at the Barabati Stadium here.         
	Known for their batting depth, West Zone have, surprisingly, struggled to put up a combined effort. In their first match against South Zone, it was the individual brilliance of skipper Wasim Jaffer which took the team through. The team will yet again bank on the dependable Jaffer, who recently led Mumbai to their 38th Ranji Trophy triumph.         
	Their opening combination of former India wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel and the talented Ajinkya Rahane is yet to give the side a good start. In the middle-order, Cheteshwar Pujara has the ability to play a defiant innings but his orthodox style has not helped the teams cause in the shorter version of the game.         
	Pujara scored an unbeaten 50 off 100 balls against Zimbabwe Presidents XI Monday, but it was his Saurashtra teammate Ravindra Jadeja who hit an unbeaten 13-ball 28 to help the side notch a victory with a bonus point.         
	We have made the final with bonus points from both the matches. I dont think there is any problem in any of the departments. We are confident of a good show against East also, coach Debu Mitra said, adding that their injured medium pacer Jitendra Patil has been replaced by Saurashtra seamer Jayesh Odedara.         
	West suffered an early setback Monday when Patil was ruled out of the match after twisting his ankle while bowling.         
	Odedara, who was the stand-bye, has been brought in place of Patil. I dont think it will be a factor, Mitra insisted.         
	For East Zone, it is their team spirit that has done the trick so far in this tournament. In Manoj Tiwary, East have a talented and energetic skipper, who is focussed on unity among the players.         
	Team spirit and backing each other has been our main strength in this tournament. After coming here, I have told the boys about the importance of playing as a team. Most in our side are youngsters representing different states, but I have made sure that they play as a team and compliment each other on the field, Tiwary said.                 
	Wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman Saha has been the pick of the batsmen, giving the side a perfect start with his opening partner Natraj Behera. Jharkhand youngster Ishank Jaggi has been a revelation with an unbeaten century against North Zone that helped the team get past the 300-run mark.         
	In bowling, the experienced Ranadeb Bose will take charge with the mercurial Ashok Dinda, even as the fifth option continues to be a worry.         
	Tiwary had to bowl the full quota of 10 overs in the last match after the fifth bowler Tushar Saha gave away 21 runs in his three overs. The think-tank is contemplating replacing Saha with either Assam all-rounder Shib Sankar Roy or Orissa left-arm pacer Pritamjeet Das.         
	The pitch, which is yet to be used in the tournament, may be a concern for both the teams who have already complained about the slowness of the Barabati track.

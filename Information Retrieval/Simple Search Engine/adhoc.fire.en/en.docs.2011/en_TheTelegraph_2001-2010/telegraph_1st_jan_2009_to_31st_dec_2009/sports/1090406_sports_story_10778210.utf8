The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jiang test awaits Saina 
                                                     Jiang test awaits Saina 
                  Saina Nehwal                     
	New Delhi: Ace shuttler Saina Nehwal will have to shrug off the Indian Open disappointment as she faces defending champion Jiang Yanjiao of China in the first round of the Asian badminton Championship starting in Suwon, Korea from Monday.         
	Seventh-seeded Saina, who lost to Julia Pei Xian Wong in the quarterfinals of the recently-concluded Indian Open in Hyderabad, will have to put up a consistent performance as even if she gets past the former World Junior champion, Jiang, she will, in all probability, bump into world number five Lin Wang or Malaysian world number 15 Wong Mew Choo in the last eight round.         
	However, Saina will be hoping to meet Mew Choo in the quarterfinals as she had defeated the Malaysian on her home turf in the World Super Series Masters Final last year.         
	I tend not to think about my opponents strengths or if she is the defending champion. I know I am playing well and she would be also in fine form as she has been training hard for sometime now, so it would be a tough match, said Saina.         
	The last time I played against her it was a three-game match, so I am confident and I know if I can play well I can beat her, she added.         
	On her latest rise in world rankings to the number eight position, Saina said she was happy but the road ahead would be difficult.         
	It will be tough going ahead. I will have to win more tournaments and gather more points if I have to reach my aim of reaching the top five, she said.         
	Meanhwhile, returning to the court after a long injury lay-off, the other Indian in the womens singles category, Aditi Mutatkar will take on Chiang Pei Hsin of Chinese Taipei in another opening round encounter.         
	Among Indian men, third-seeded Chetan Anand will meet Japanese Kozai Kazuteru in the opening round, while P. Kashyap will face Nepalese Rana Kishor and Anand Pawar will take on a qualifier.         
	Top Indian mixed doubles pair of Jwala Gutta and V Diju, who cracked into the top 10 bracket recently by virtue of their runner-up finish at the Indian Open, will take on a qualifier in the first round.         
	While, mens doubles pair of Rupesh Kumar and Thomas Sanave will open their campaign against Chinese pair of Xu Chen and Guo Zhendong.           (PTI)

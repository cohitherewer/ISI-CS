The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Messis my Maradona, says Diego
                                                     Messis my Maradona, says Diego
                  Lionel Messi                     
	Buenos Aires: Argentina coach Diego Maradona says Lionel Messis importance to the national team is reminiscent of himself.         
	Messi is my Maradona. There is no other player more important than Messi, Maradona said in Mondays edition of a sports daily. I could say that in my team, there is Messi and 10 others.         
	Messi, one of the best players in the world, has never performed as well with Argentina as he has with Barcelona, which won an unprecedented triple of the Champions League, Spanish league and Copa Del Ray titles last season.         
	I love working with him, Maradona said. He makes everything seem easy. Hes got the ball stuck to his foot, part of his body. Its like, here comes his foot and the ball as well. This is something I havent seen in any other player, and Ive seen lots of players.         
	Maradona joked that the Barcelona star is so famous now, he cant be bothered to return his calls.         
	Hes impossible to reach, Maradona said. Its easier to speak with (US President Barack) Obama than with Leo.         
	Argentina host Brazil on September 5 in a crucial World Cup qualifier. Brazil lead South American qualifying with 27 points. Argentina are in fourth place with 22. Only the top four teams automatically qualify for next years tournament in South Africa. The fifth-placed side face a playoff with the No.4 side from the North, Central and Caribbean region to advance.         
	Argentina also have qualifying games remaining with Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay.         
	We have four very tough games, but we are aiming at the Brazilians. Brazil are the team to bring down, Maradona said.         
	(Brazil is) a team that plays well, that has talent, that has luck, and that has played so well for so long that it has many World Cups.         
	But we are Argentina  you cant forget that!         
	Maradona again suggested it was unlikely that playmaker Juan Ramon Riquelme would be re-called to the team.         
	The 31-year-old Riquelme retired from international football in March, saying he and Maradona did not get along. Maradona had criticised Riquelmes play and overlooked him for several friendlies after being selected as coach in November.         
	Julio Grondona, the head of the Argentine football federation, has tried to intervene and bring Riquelme back on the team.         
	However, Maradona said the situation is closed, although nothing is definite.         
	But Riquelme has many things to explain to the players and staff, Maradona added.           (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Somebody couldve been killed: Bedi
                                                                                                                       7                                        Somebody couldve been killed: Bedi
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              Bishan Singh Bedi                      
	Calcutta: In former India captain Bishan Singh Bedis opinion, somebody couldve been killed at the Kotla on Sunday morning.         
	The surface was very dangerous... Somebody couldve been killed and I hold two people directly responsible  Chetan Chauhan of the DDCA and Daljit Singh (head of the Boards grounds and pitches Committee till the fiasco)... Having said that, I doubt if anybody will ever be held accountable, though, Bedi told The Telegraph.         
	[Later, in the evening, news came that Chauhan and the rest of the DDCAs grounds and pitches committee had put in their papers, owning moral responsibility.]         
	Outspoken as ever, Bedi added: I say that because whenever theres a problem, everybody comes together (to save their skins)... These things only happen in India... Generally speaking, the norm is that crumbs are thrown at people and theyre happy to accept the crumbs... Thats how our Board functions...         
	According to Bedi, a vicious cycle is in operation and thats why a big majority of former cricketers stay away from the Board. We just dont have the right persons for the right job... Thats the reality... Thats why we have to face shameful incidents... I dont think lessons are going to be learnt, he asserted.         
	Bedi pointed out that the DDCA president, senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley, had good intentions, but wanted to make peace with everybody. Jaitley should, instead, be putting his foot down whenever needed... There are too many corrupting influences in the DDCA.         
	One cant really disagree with Bedi.         
	Incidentally, two months ago, the DDCA had goofed up on the distribution of mandatory complimentaries. Chris Broad, Match Referee during the India-Australia ODI series, didnt get his quota. As also some affiliated units of the Board.         
	So much for the DDCAs functioning.

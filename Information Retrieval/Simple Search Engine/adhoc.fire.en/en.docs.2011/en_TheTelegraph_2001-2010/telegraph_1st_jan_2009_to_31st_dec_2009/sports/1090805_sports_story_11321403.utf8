            STAR RACER                                    
	Calcutta: Fields are packed to the capacity of the monsoon track in Wednesdays six-event card, featuring the 1,100m Great Scot Cup. Although there are 12 horses in the line up, the race may see the Arti Doctor-trained Artistical calling the shots in the hands of jockey Rajinder.           
	Artis Excel, too, is fancied to claim the 1,400m Vagabond Handicap. C. Alford partners the Serious Spender colt.          
	Meanwhile, the computerised betting system, which crashed on Sunday, is learnt to have been restored. The totalisator, therefore, is expected to function normally.

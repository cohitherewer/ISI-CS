The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barreto blues for Bagan
                                                   Barreto blues for Bagan
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagans Jose Ramirez Barreto will not play their I-League match against JCT Thursday. Barreto, who limped through his 24-minutes on the field versus Chirag United Monday, has injured his quadriceps muscle and is also doubtful for the October 12 clash against Viva Kerala.         
	Barretos injury has come at a time when Bagan need their talismanic forward the most. With Edeh Chidi yet to hit the purple patch and fringe forwards like Branco Cardozo and Suraj Mondal not making the most of their chances, Barreto is Bagans best bet. Coach Karim Bencharifa though is yet to decide who partners Chidi. I have my options. I will take a call only on Wednesday, he said.         
	With Bagan in trouble, rivals JCT are fancying their chances. And they have every reason to. An emphatic 5-1 win against Lajong FC has given them the confidence that they can beard Bagan in their own den. We can do it. I dont see any reason why not, said hattrick hero Baljit Singh Sahni.         
	Baljit said he would at least try to score one on Thursday. Its not possible to get a hattrick in every match. But I will definitely try to get one at least, he said after a practice session at Makardah in Howrah on Tuesday. Baljit feels consistent performance in the I-League would definitely earn him a national call-up. I want to wear the national jersey as soon as possible. And for that I have to perform. I have started well and hopefully this will continue, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Bencharifa allegedly got into a scuffle with a journalist from a vernacular daily Tuesday morning. The reporter apparently entered the dressing room at the Bagan tent without his permission and it was not to the coachs liking. Bagan officials, however, ruled out any action against the Moroccan coach.         
	Also Tuesday, Bagan have written to the IFA saying the AIFF arrange to pay N.S. Manjus monthly salary as the defender picked up an injury while on national duty.

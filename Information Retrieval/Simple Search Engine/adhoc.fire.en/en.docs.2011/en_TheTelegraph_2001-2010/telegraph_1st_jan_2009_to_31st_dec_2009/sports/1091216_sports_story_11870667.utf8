The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | My best ODI knock: Sehwag
                                                                                                                       7                                      My best ODI knock: Sehwag
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Rajkot: Virender Sehwags blistering form continued as he smashed a 102-ball 146 in the first India-Sri Lanka one-day International to lead his team to an imposing total here Tuesday.         
	At the post-match press conference, Man of the Match Sehwag rated his knock as the best but complimented his teammates for a narrow three-run victory saying that it was only possible because of a team effort.               
	 The following are excerpts                 
	Tuesdays knock         
	This is definitely my best one-day innings. Before this, I had made 130 against New Zealand But today (Tuesday)s innings was special for me as this is my highest one-day score as well.         
	The teams performance         
	The victory was not made possible only because of my knock. I could not have won the match alone. There were contributions from (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni, Sachin (Tendulkar), (Virat) Kohli and (Ravindra) Jadeja as well. So it was a team effort.         
	If there was a target on mind         
	We knew the wicket was flat and the ground was also small. So we knew that there would be quite a few runs. When me and Sachin were batting we were looking at 350. But the partnership between Dhoni and me changed the whole approach as we reached 300 in some 35 overs. So at that stage, we thought 400 was possible.         
	Bowling at the death         
	One-day cricket is batsmans game. It was a very good one-day wicket. But Zaheer (Khan) and Ashish (Nehra) were very good in the last five overs or so. Zaheer bowled nearly 25 yorkers and Nehra also bowled excellently, choking the Lankans effort in the late overs. Harbhajan too was good as he got the important wicket of Dilshan. That helped us win in the end.         
	His injury         
	I had banged my knee on the field, so I had to leave the ground. But physio Nitin Patel is attending me and, hopefully, I will be fit for second the one-dayer in Nagpur.         
	The turning point of the match         
	Both (Kumar) Sangakkara and (Tillekaratne) Dilshan were batting superbly. They exploited the conditions well, and Dilshan, especially, was good. When they were batting so well it looked as if we might lose the match. But even then we did not think the match would run so close.         
	Bhajji got rid of Dilshan and Sangakkara too did not last the distance, though, at one stage, we feared that he would. However, we got their wickets at the right time, and the run out of (Mahela) Jayawardene, a good piece of fielding from Virat, brought us back into the match.         
	Team Indias fielding         
	We have dropped a lot of catches in the T20 and also dropped a few here. But we effected run-outs and fielded very reasonably well which contributed a lot to the victory.

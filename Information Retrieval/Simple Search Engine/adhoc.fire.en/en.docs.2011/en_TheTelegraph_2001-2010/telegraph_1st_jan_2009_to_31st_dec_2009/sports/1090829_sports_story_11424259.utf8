The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tomba signs for Bagan
                                                   Tomba signs for Bagan
            A STAFF REPORTER                       
	Calcutta: Snehasish Chakraborty finally signed for Mohun Bagan on Friday. The Players Status Committee, which met at the IFA office on Friday, not only cleared him for the forthcoming season, it also reduced the Rs 2-lakh penalty, imposed on him for criticising the apex body, to Rs 50,000. Chakraborty had sent a letter to the IFA on Wednesday apologising for his comment and sought a reduced penalty.         
	Jose Ramirez Barreto, Habibur Rahman, Tomba Singh and Edeh Chidi also signed for the club. Mohun Bagan sources, however, said that Barreto and Habibur would not be included in the IFA Shield squad.         
	Tomba has been in the wilderness for more than two seasons and it will be interesting to see how he performs. I never thought I will play again after that right knee injury. I was low in confidence during my two years with East Bengal. But coach (Bencharifa) helped me a lot, he said.         
	East Bengal have already dashed off a letter to the IFA saying that Tomba cannot play for Mohun Bagan till he clears Rs 8 lakh due to the club. He cannot play for Bagan till we get the money back, a club official said.         
	Mohammedan Sporting, meanwhile, signed Brazilian Eduardo Escobar, who was with the JCT till the last season.         
	Chirag United also bolstered their squad by signing Brazilian striker Joshimar. Chirags young frontliner Shankar Oraon, who had a ligament tear on his right knee and was expected to be out for at least six months, underwent an operation on Friday.

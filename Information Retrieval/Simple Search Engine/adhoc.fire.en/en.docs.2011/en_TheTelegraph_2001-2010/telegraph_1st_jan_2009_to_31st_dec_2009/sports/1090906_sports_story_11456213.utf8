The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kapil doesnt buy Sachin formula
                                                   Kapil doesnt buy Sachin formula
                      
	New Delhi: Former India captain Kapil Dev does not favour any tinkering with the one-day format. Asked about his views on Sachin Tendulkars proposal that 50-over cricket be spilt into four innings of 25 overs each, Kapil said he would rather the original format was kept.         
	I dont think you can have so many combinations and so many things. Every format  20 over, 50 over and Test match  has its own place so let us not muck around. The more you muck around the more you are going to spoil cricket, said Kapil, who led India to victory in the World Cup in 1983.         
	Cricketers should understand, the ICC should understand and cricket Boards should understand this. Why are we trying to spoil the basics thats my logic, he added.         
	Kapil, however, was quick to add that Tendulkar had the freedom to air his view, and that he respects it. This is his view and one should respect it. But at the end of the day I dont think you can have so many combinations, he told a television news broadcaster.

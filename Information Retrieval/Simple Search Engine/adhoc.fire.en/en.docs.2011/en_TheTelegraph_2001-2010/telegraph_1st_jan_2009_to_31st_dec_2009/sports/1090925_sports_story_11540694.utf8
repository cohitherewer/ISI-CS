	London: Holders Manchester United overcame the 29th-minute sending-off of teenaged Brazilian defender Fabio Da Silva to beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 1-0 in the third round of the League Cup on Wednesday.         
	League leaders Chelsea made it eight wins out of eight in competitive games with a 1-0 win over west London neighbours Queens Park Rangers, Peter Crouch bagged a hattrick as Tottenham Hotspur won 5-1 at Preston North End and Everton put Phil Browns future in jeopardy by thrashing Hull City 4-0 away.         
	Aston Villa beat Cardiff City 1-0 while a near-full strength Manchester City needed extra time to beat Fulham 2-1.         
	Manchester United fielded an entirely changed team from that which won the Manchester derby on Sunday and the stand-ins were presented with a stiff test of their character when 18-year-old Fabios first appearance of the season ended after 29 minutes when he was sent off for hauling down Michael Kightly.         
	United, with Michael Owen among the starters, remained the more dominant side though and won it in the 66th minute when Danny Welbeck finished off a neat passing move.

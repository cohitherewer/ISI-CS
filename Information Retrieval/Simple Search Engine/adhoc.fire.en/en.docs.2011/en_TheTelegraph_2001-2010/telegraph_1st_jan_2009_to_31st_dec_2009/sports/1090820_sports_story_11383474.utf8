The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | NZ claw back into match
                                                     NZ claw back into match
                              
	Galle: New Zealand fought back over the final two sessions on day two to put the first Test against Sri Lanka on an even keel Wednesday.         
	The visitors reached 87 for two at stumps after Thilan Samaraweera top-scored with 159 to take Sri Lanka to a first innings score of 452.         
	For New Zealand, it was seamer Chris Martin (4/77) and captain Daniel Vettori (4/78) who played key roles in preventing the hosts from recording the giant score they threatened to when they were only four wickets down with the score approaching 400.         
	In reply, New Zealand opener Tim McIntosh was unbeaten on 36 in a patient 88-ball innings batting with night watchman Jeetan Patel on six.         
	Martin Guptil (24) was the first New Zealand batsman to be dismissed. Daniel Flynn (14) was bowled by spinner Ajantha Mendis approaching stumps.

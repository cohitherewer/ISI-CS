    - SECOND ODI vs AUSSIeS Munaf may replace Praveen; Yuvraj returns           INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                                      Yuvraj Singh      
	Nagpur: Mahendra Singh Dhoni had a wry smile on his lips after practice on Tuesday evening. If the news that Australia were struggling to put together a decent bowling attack for the second one-dayer had come as a welcome relief for a side trailing 0-1 in the seven-match Hero Honda Cup, the Team India captain wasnt showing it.         
	Were not really worried about their injuries. We needed to work on a few areas and we are working on that, Dhoni said. Brett Lee and James Hopes are out with elbow and hamstring problems and there were doubts over Mitchell Johnsons left ankle as well, but Tim Nielsen was hopeful of the left-arm quicks participation.         
	Mitchell woke up a lot better today (Tuesday) morning than we thought he would beSo its really pleasing to see him get up today and shine We will see how he pulls up through the training session and all the indications are that he might well be available Wednesday morning, the coach said.         
	Theres further respite for Dhoni  Yuvraj Singh will play Wednesdays day-night encounter after missing the Champions Trophy and the opener in Vadodara.         
	The return of Yuvraj couldnt have been timed any better. For a side struggling with middle-order blues, he comes in with the confidence and the belief that his presence will reassure and reignite the passion in his teammates. If he and Virender Sehwag can provide the sparks, not to mention Sachin Tendulkar, there will be no stopping the Indians.         
	Yuvrajs inclusion will mean Virat Kohli missing out while Ravindra Jadeja will keep his place because of his all-round abilities.         
	The bowling, though, will continue to be a worry. As Dhoni admitted: Weve not been great with our death bowling. If you see the last game, the first few overs  42nd over onwards  it was good and in the 50th we gave away one run.         
	In between there was a span of four overs when we gave away 50-52 runs. If we can bring that down, say by two to five runs, it can count at the end.         
	Praveen Kumar, who gave away 77 runs in his 10 overs, may have to pay for his profligacy in Vadodara. Despite his heroics with the bat and Dhonis support, the Uttar Pradesh pacer could make way for Munaf Patel.         
	The batting Powerplay has also confused both sides. We are discussing how to go about it. It is a work in progress. In Vadodara, we lost Cameron White in the second ball of the Powerplay. Then we lost a couple of wickets and it affected our chances of a bigger total, said Nielsen.         
	Both teams scored around 30-35 runs in the Powerplay and lost three wickets in Vadodara. One of the games where the batting teams did not capitalise on that. Getting to know what time is the best to take it is important, was Dhonis view.         
	Besides the injury worries, the way Australia nearly surrendered the advantage in the opening match has also left Ricky Ponting and Co. worried. Assuming Johnson is passed fit, they will have to replace Lee and Hopes.         
	Doug Bollinger or Ben Hilfenhaus is likely to fill up one while the visitors could strengthen their batting with the inclusion of Shaun Marsh. The flat conditions could mean Marsh proving to be a handful, but the dew factor has both captains wary of the toss.         
	Yes, it will be a bit more difficult with dew around, especially for the spinners. They will find it hard to grip the ball It will have an impact. The team batting second will probably have difficulty chasing... so the team batting first needs to make a competitive total, Nielsen sounded a bit wary.         
	Despite their handicaps, you can never underestimate the Aussies. India, no doubt, will have to display mental and technical fortitude to overcome a hungry opponent ready for the kill. Dont forget they are a confident unit coming off a tremendous run in one-dayers  a 6-1 decimation of England and the Champions Trophy triumph.         
	Match begins: 2.30 pm.

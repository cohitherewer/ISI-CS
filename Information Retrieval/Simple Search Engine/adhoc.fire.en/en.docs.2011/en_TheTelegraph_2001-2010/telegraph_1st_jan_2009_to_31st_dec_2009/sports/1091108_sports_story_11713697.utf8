            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Newly recruited East Bengal coach Philippe de Ridder on Saturday said that a turn around in his teams fortune is imminent but the fans have to be patient.         
	After rain there is always sunshine. The fans have to be a little patient and support us but there will be sunshine definitely, De Ridder, who watched from the stands as the East Bengal beat Air India 1-0 at the Cooperage, said.         
	De Ridder, who had coached East Bengal in 2005-06, said the team did not lack quality but it needed to be a more cohesive unit.         
	The team is down but good. There is individual quality but they have to work as a team, the Belgian said.         
	It is like a clock. The hands are of different size but they work in unison. Similarly, in football, all the eleven players must know where they have to go. Even if one player doesnt know, then we have problem .         
	De Ridder has brought along his assistant Daniel Ghersihon, who will work with the players in the role of a physiotherapist and individual coach for one month.

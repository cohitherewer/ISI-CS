                                                   Want to finish 5-0: Dhoni
    - Unruly elements hold up play for 27 minutes Murali breaks Akram record           A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                            
	Calcutta/Colombo: The Indians are on a roll. In recording their longest winning run  nine matches  Mahendra Singh Dhonis men pushed Sri Lanka further towards their first 5-0 whitewash at home.         
	Sachin Tendulkar and Zaheer Khans absence  both rested for the fourth one-dayer  had no effect as Gautam Gambhirs career best 150 off 147 balls and Dhonis 94 at No.3 helped India set a daunting target of 333. Sri Lanka didnt seem to be in the chase and eventually ended 67 runs behind.         
	Not for the first time in the series, unruly elements in the crowd at the Premadasa Stadium interrupted play, and this time Dhoni led his team off the field. Only 17.2 overs had been bowled then, and 27 minutes were lost due to the disruption. Play resumed only after a few stands were vacated and additional policemen deployed.         
	An indication of Sri Lankas plight was their decision to rest mystery spinner Ajantha Mendis. Muttiah Muralidharan took the one wicket he needed to break Wasim Akrams record in the 48th over of the innings.         
	The start wasnt easy as Virender Sehwag left early and Gambhir and Dhoni found the going tough. But the pair batted with precision and ran the singles hard as the Lankan fielding crumbled under pressure.         
	Dhoni and Gambhir stepped up the pace when Mahela Jayawardene turned to his fourth and fifth bowlers. In back-to-back overs, Gambhir hit Angelo Matthews for a six to bring up his half-century and Dhoni treated Muttiah Muralidharan with disdain. That opened the floodgates and there was no looking back as they stitched together 188 runs.         
	Dhonis dismissal triggered a mini collapse but there was no stopping Man of the Match Gambhir.         
	The lefthander switched from steady accumulator to ruthless hitter. He was on 87 off 98 balls when Yusuf Pathan got out, but scored 63 off the next 49. Along with Gambhir, Suresh Raina kept finding the gaps and India gathered 97 in the last 12 overs.         
	I am happy for the ninth win (on the trot) but if we can add one more to it, it would be great, Dhoni said after the match.         
	Dhoni missed the well-deserved century as he batted aggressively in the nineties but justified the game plan. There was a ball change in the 34th over and we had to take the second Powerplay as well. So I thought one of the batsmen had to quickly get his hundred and capitalise on the Powerplay.         
	Tillekeratne Dilshan and Sanath Jayasuriya got Lanka off to a blazing start but the weight of the required run-rate was too much and they perished.         
	Still at 108 for two, Lanka were in the chase but lost the plot after the interruption in the face of a disconcerting turn which the Indian spinners derived from the pitch. Pragyan Ojha was the most impressive. Sehwag and Yuvraj, too, made full use of the conditions.         
	The following are excerpts from what the captains and Gambhir had to say:         
	Dhoni: Well, of course, if we add one more (to the nine on the trot) we will be happy, but Im happy with the ninth win. We look to perform as a unit. We hunt in a pack I had not batted at No. 3 for a long time. Today with the series in the bag, I had an opportunity. We had a long batting list so I knew that even if I got out on zero there are many to follow.         
	Jayawardene: Chasing 330-odd was tough... With the ball still hard we went for it, but with the ball getting softer we lost wickets at regular intervals.         
	We needed to strike a balance in the chase, consolidating first before going for the runs. India again had a big partnership at the top The wicket turned in the latter half of the match.         
	Our spinners didnt have the opportunity of bowling then. We have to improve in the next game. Our fielding has been sloppy. We also have to get our batting and bowling right.         
	Gambhir: I was hitting the ball well. It was a perfect platform for me today to play a long innings. There was very little pressure on me. I try to stay positive. When you have Viru at the other end you dont have to do much. He takes care of the scoreboard.         
	I could take it easy. Credit must also go to MS (Dhoni) for the confidence and security... And to the coach as well. I want to continue my 2008 form in 2009. (Gary) Kirsten is one of the best coaches India has ever had. Under Kirsten and MS India are performing very well.

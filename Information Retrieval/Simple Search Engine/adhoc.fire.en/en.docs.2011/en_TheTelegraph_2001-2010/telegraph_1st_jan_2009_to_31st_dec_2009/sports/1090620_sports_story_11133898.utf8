The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brilliant Egypt upset Italy 1-0
                                                   Brilliant Egypt upset Italy 1-0
                            
	Johannesburg: Egypt scored their greatest ever victory with a thoroughly deserved 1-0 win on Thursday over world champions Italy who had never previously lost to an African team.         
	The shock result means Group B in the Confederations Cup hangs in the balance with all four teams still able to progress to next weeks semi-finals.         
	Mohamed Hommos goal five minutes before halftime clinched the first points of the tournament for the African champions, who narrowly lost 4-3 to Brazil in their opening game.         
	Most of the Egyptians and coach Hassan Shehata shed tears of joy at the final whistle as they became the first African side in 15 attempts to beat the Italians.         
	Key second half saves from veteran goalkeeper Essam Al Hadari, who had an inspired match, kept the Italians at bay while Vincenzo Iaquinta hit the crossbar with just minutes remaining as Egypt weathered a late onslaught.         
	All the teams today are very good. You always have to be at your best, said Italy coach Marcello Lippi. We tried some different things. It didnt go very well. We didnt do the things wed prepared and wanted to do. We played a bad first half. We did very well in the second. Their keeper made three or four very difficult saves.         
	Brazil, who beat the United States in Pretoria earlier on Thursday, lead the standings with six points while Italy and Egypt have three.         
	Brazil and Italy meet in Pretoria on Sunday, while the Egyptians play the Americans, who have yet to pick up a point, in Rustenburg at the same time.         
	Despite losing both games the US still have a remote chance of getting through to the last four.         
	Lippi made five changes to the team that started against the US on Monday, with the return of fit-again captain Fabio Cannavaro, winning his 124th cap  two short of Paolo Maldinis all-time Italian record of 126.         
	Cannavaro, typically, added steel to the Italian defence, while Giuseppe Rossi, who came on as a substitute and scored twice against the U.S., added youthful zest to the attack.         
	Both teams enjoyed plenty of possession in their first meeting since Italy beat Egypt 5-1 in a World Cup qualifier 55 years ago, but it was a still a real surprise when the Egyptians took the lead five minutes before the break.         
	Italy only had themselves to blame, leaving Hommos unmarked to score with a powerful header from Mohamed Aboutrikas perfect inswinging corner. (Reuters)

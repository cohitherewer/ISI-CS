The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev, Randhawa make the cut
                                                   Jeev, Randhawa make the cut
                      
	Doha: Jyoti Randhawa was the lone Indian to return a sub-par card as he and Jeev Milkha Singh made the cut while compatriots Shiv Kapur and S.S.P. Chowrasia fell by the wayside in the Qatar Masters here on Friday.         
	Randhawa brought home a second round card of two-under 70 to aggregate three-under 141 and join the likes of Ernie Els at tied 25th place.         
	One shot behind at tied 36th position was Jeev, having carded an even-par 72 in the second round. It was the end of the road for Kapur (148) and Chowrasia (149) who found themselves way off the mark after the cut was set at 144.         
	Randhawa played compact golf and mixed four birdies with a couple of bogeys to finish the day on a satisfying note. Jeev too began well and took the turn at two-under before the 13th hole double bogey undid the good work.         
	After his opening round of 72, Kapur needed a strong show on Friday to hang on for weekend action but the Delhi pro went four-over 76At the top, Louis Oosthuizen (132) blasted 65 for a three-shot lead over Andrew Coltart who carded 69 on Friday.

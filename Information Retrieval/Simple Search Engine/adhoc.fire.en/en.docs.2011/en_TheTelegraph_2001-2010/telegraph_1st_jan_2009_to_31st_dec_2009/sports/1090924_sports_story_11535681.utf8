The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Renault ring Bell
                                                     Renault ring Bell

	London: Renault technical director Bob Bell will take over from the departed Flavio Briatore as team principal following the recent race-fixing controversy, the Formula One team said on Wednesday.         
	Bob Bell will attend all the remaining races of the season and will be the teams spokesperson on all sporting and technical matters, the team said in a statement. Bell will also be the teams chief technical officer.         
	Meanwhile, Renault have told Formula Ones governing body they want to stay in the sport. They have also withdrawn criminal proceedings in France against Brazilian driver Nelson Piquet and his father, a triple world champion and namesake, for false accusations and attempted blackmail.         
	The former champions, who were handed a suspended permanent ban on Monday, made their position clear in documents posted on the website of the governing International Automobile Federation. Renault F1 and its parent company have given serious consideration as to whether it should remain in the sport following the prejudice caused to its corporate image by the conspiracy, in addition to the existing background of financial pressures that have caused car manufacturers to withdraw, the team said.         
	But it has concluded that it would like to remain in Formula One and continue to make an important contribution to the sport. The race-fixing controversy came to light after Piquet was dismissed by the team and told the FIA he had crashed deliberately in last years Singapore Grand Prix in a plot with Briatore and Symonds to help team mate Fernando Alonso win.         
	Renault did not contest the allegations and said in a letter that the conspirators were on a frolic of their own, acting against the interests of the team and sport in general. Renault F1 will introduce a new structure within the team and will review its internal procedures in an effort to ensure that this type of incident will never happen again, the team added.

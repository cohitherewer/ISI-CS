The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | City test for Reds

	London: Manchester Citys visit to Liverpool is the eye-catching game of the Premier League schedule Saturday when the big four resume their quest for the title after the international break.         
	Chelsea, with an impressive home record of six straight wins, will be confident of staying five points clear by beating Wolves at Stamford Bridge. The Blues havent conceded at home since the opening game of the season against Hull.         
	Third-place Manchester United host 12th place Everton but have problems in defence, with Rio Ferdinand out, John Shea and Johnny Evans doubtful and Gary Neville suspended. United hope to have Nemanja Vidic back after a calf muscle injury.         
	Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez will get a close-up of the missing piece of his jigsaw puzzle on Saturday when Gareth Barry runs out for Manchester City at Anfield for a match with huge implications for both clubs.         
	Had things gone to plan for Benitez, Liverpool would have signed the versatile midfielder from Aston Villa at the end of the 2007-08 season and gone to win a long-awaited Premier League title a year later.         
	That deal fell through, however, and now England international Barry is a key figure at ambitious City, one of several clubs looking to challenge Englands top four.         
	Failure to sign Barry was a huge blow for Benitez, although Liverpools superb title charge last season, which ended in narrow failure behind Manchester United, disguised the impact.         
	This season, however, five defeats in 12 league games have left Liverpools title aspirations in ruins and with Xavi Alonso sold in the off-season, the Anfield club looks short on the kind of proven midfield quality Barry would have brought.         
	Defeat against City on Saturday would leave Liverpool in grave danger of becoming mid-table also rans.         
	The thing about Barry is that he can play in three positions, Benitez said Wednesday. To sign Barry would have been a good addition for the team. Everything was perfect. Good player, good mentality and English. The priority was Barry, then (Robbie) Keane.         
	Keane, who was only signed from Tottenham Hotspur, according to Benitez this week, to link up with Barry lasted just six months at Anfield before returning to north London.         
	While Liverpool have struggled badly this season, Manchester Citys impact on the Premier League has not quite been what their billionaire Abu Dhabi owners would have hoped for.         
	A stoppage time defeat by Manchester United is Citys only league loss this season but Mark Hughess side have drawn their last five matches and, for all the millions spent on signing the likes of Barry, Emmanuel Adebayor and Carlos Tevez, they still look far from the finished article.         
	Defeat for City on Saturday would shift the spotlight away from the under-fire Benitez for a while and turn up the heat on Hughes and Benitez has been confidently predicting all week that the real Liverpool is about to stand up.         
	For me, its three points in the next game, Benitez said. I have confidence that the squad is better than people think.         
	Both sides have injury problems. Liverpool are expected to be without striker Fernando Torrres for the lunchtime kickoff at Anfield although Steven Gerrard and Glen Johnson, who both missed Englands weekend friendly against Brazil in Doha, should be fit. City will be without Bulgarian winger Martin Petrov who is sidelined with a knee injury.         
	Leaders Chelsea host Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday with a five-point lead over Arsenal and Manchester United.         
	United could be eight points behind Chelsea by the time they kick off against Everton while Arsenal, who have problems at left-back with Gael Clichy and Kieran Gibbs both injured, face a test of their dazzling form at Sunderland.

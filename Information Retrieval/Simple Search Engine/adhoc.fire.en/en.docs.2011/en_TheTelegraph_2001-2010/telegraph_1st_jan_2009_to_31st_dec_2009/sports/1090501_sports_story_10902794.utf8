The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bangladesh likely to toe BCCI line
                                                   Bangladesh likely to toe BCCI line
                      
	Dhaka: Bangladesh may lift their ban on Indian Cricket League (ICL) players after India offered a similar amnesty, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said on Thursday.         
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said on Wednesday that the players who joined the unauthorised league would be allowed to play domestic competition if they sever ties with the rebel body by May 31.         
	India took the decision in line with a directive from International Cricket Council (ICC) and we will also consider the same in our next board meeting on May 9, said BCB vice-president Mahbubul Anam.         
	According to the ICC decision, which will be effective from June 1, the cricketers playing in any unapproved leagues will be ineligible to play international cricket, but they could return to the international level after scrapping their contract with that unapproved league, he said.

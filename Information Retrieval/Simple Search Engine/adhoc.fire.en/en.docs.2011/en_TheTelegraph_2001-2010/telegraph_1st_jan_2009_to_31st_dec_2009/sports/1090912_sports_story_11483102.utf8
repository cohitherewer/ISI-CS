                                                     IAAF refuses comment
                  Semenya                     
	Monaco: The IAAF said Friday it has received the results of gender tests on South African runner Caster Semenya but is still reviewing them and will not issue any final decision until November.         
	The International Association of Athletics Federations did not confirm or deny Australian reports that the recently crowned womens world 800m champion has male and female sexual organs.         
	We would like to emphasise that these should not be considered as official statements by the IAAF, the federation said in a statement.         
	No decision on the case will be communicated until the IAAF has had the opportunity to complete this examination. We do not expect to make a final decision on this case before the next meeting of the IAAF Council which takes place in Monaco on November 20-21.         
	Semenyas father, Jacob, expressed anger when contacted on Friday morning, saying people who insinuate his daughter is not a woman are sick. They are crazy.         
	He said he had not been told anything by the IAAF, Athletics South Africa or his daughter. (AP)

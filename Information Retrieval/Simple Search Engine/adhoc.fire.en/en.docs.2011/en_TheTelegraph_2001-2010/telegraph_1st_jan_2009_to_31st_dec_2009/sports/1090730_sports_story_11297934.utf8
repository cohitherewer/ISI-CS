The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bangla make short work of the Windies
                                                     Bangla make short work of the Windies
                  Shakib-al Hasan                     
	Roseau (Dominica): Half-centuries from Shakib Al Hasan and Mohammed Ashraful trumped a maiden ODI hundred from Travis Dowlin to inspire Bangladesh to a three-wicket win over the West Indies in the second ODI and see the visitors take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the series.         
	Shakib, the stand-in Bangladesh captain, struck 65 from 61 balls to earn the Man of the Match award and skipper Ashraful scored 64 from 77 balls, as the Tigers successfully chased down 275 in the match at Windsor Park on Tuesday.         
	Left-hander Abdur Razzak sealed the result with six balls to spare, when he top-edged a pull off Dave Bernard Jr to third man for four.         
	It was Bangladeshs highest successful run chase in more than 200 ODIs, and the victory followed their first-ever against the West Indies at the same venue on Sunday.         
	The series concludes on Friday at Warner Park in St Kitts, where the two sides will also contest a Twenty20 International on Sunday.         
	But the Tigers stumbled through their chase after Dowlin struck an even, unbeaten 100 to help the hosts post 274 for six from their quota of 50 overs.         
	They made a steady start and then wobbled at 64 for two before Ashraful featured in two successive half-century stands that stabilised the innings and put Bangladesh firmly on course.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Amlas century puts SA on top
                                                                                                                       7                                      Amlas century puts SA on top
                      
	Centurion: A fine century by Hashim Amla put South Africa in control of the first Test against England at the close on the fourth day on Saturday.         
	Amla made exactly 100 as South Africa declared their second innings closed on 301 for seven, leaving England a target of 364 for victory and 96 overs to survive for a draw.         
	England were 11 for one after six overs at the close after Morne Morkel had captain Andrew Strauss caught behind for a single to complete a day of dominance for the South Africans.         
	Mark Boucher scored 63 not out and Morkel lashed four boundaries in his unbeaten 22 not out off 13 deliveries, the flurry of runs enabling South Africa to declare 37 minutes before stumps.         
	James Anderson was the best of the England bowlers, taking four for 73 in 20.5 overs.         
	South Africa, leading by 62 runs on first innings, were in early trouble on 46 for four before Amla and AB de Villiers put on 119 for the fifth wicket. De Villiers played daring strokes in his 64 which came off 101 balls and included six fours and a six when he skipped down the pitch to off-spinner Graeme Swann and drove him over long-on.         
	Amla was less flamboyant but remained impressively unflappable as he compiled his seventh test century before Anderson snatched his wicket with a delivery that shot along the ground into the stumps.         
	It was a top-class innings by Amla on a pitch with disconcertingly inconsistent bounce, frustrating an England charge in which they claimed three wickets in the morning session.

                                                                                                                                   Sourav: Im sure Sachin will be around till the 2011 Cup
    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  Former India captain on his one-time opening mate             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              File picture of Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar        
	Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly, who quit international cricket exactly a year ago, formed the most successful opening pair in ODIs  21 hundred-plus and 23 in excess of 50 partnerships.         
	In fact, in that role, they totalled over 6,600 runs for India, yet another record as an opening combination.         
	On Friday, the day after Sachins classic 175 in the Hyderabad ODI, Sourav spoke to The Telegraph at some length about his one-time partner.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q Did you see the entire innings of Sachin?         
	A I did.         
	Your thoughts on that 175?         
	It was a fantastic knock... Sachins best... To be honest, I havent seen a better one-day innings from anybody.         
	Better even than the innings he himself authored in Sharjah, 11 years ago, when the Shane Warnes were taken to the cleaners?         
	Absolutely.         
	In your view, what was special?         
	The way Sachin paced the innings... Batting second and chasing 351... It was such a huge ask, yet he kept finding the gaps and clearing the field... To get 175 off only 141 deliveries says everything, doesnt it? Theres no need for me or anybody else to elaborate on such a performance.         
	What makes Sachin tick? At 36, he seems as hungry as ever...         
	Age has nothing to do with performance, so lets not talk about the age bit... Ill just say that Sachins a class act... Indeed, passion and commitment have been key elements in his representing India for as long as 20 years.         
	Today, how do you look back on your experiences with him, particularly in ODIs?         
	It was always a pleasure being in the same dressing room as Sachin... A day after that 175, people are still talking of Sachin and that innings... So, lets keep the focus on him.         
	Sachin and you hold the record for the most hundred-plus opening partnerships in ODIs and the most number of runs as an opening combination...         
	We understood each others game and complemented each other... It wasnt that one was competing against the other... Some days, Sachin hit the ball superbly, other days, I could strike it a bit better... We worked as a team and succeeded. The understanding between us was important.         
	Was there something for you to learn?         
	Yes... The way Sachin approached the game, which continues to mean everything to him... His application... The mental strength he exhibited... Sachin, to me, is all quality.         
	What can the present generation learn from Sachin?         
	Discipline, for one... Staying focused, too... He does care playing for India, otherwise he wouldnt have been around for 20 years.         
	How much longer do you expect Sachin to keep turning out in the India colours?         
	(Laughs) Till he wants to... Im sure Sachin will be around till the 2011 World Cup... You can take that from me.         
	Have you spoken to him after his 175?         
	No.         
	What will you tell Sachin the next time you meet him?         
	Will depend on the occasion... Whatever comes to mind then, probably.         
	Do you intend inviting him on your hugely successful quiz show, Dadagiri Unlimited?         
	Cant be in 2009 as the show, this season, is about to end... Four episodes remain to be shot, thats it... (After a pause) Sachin spent 12-13 years with me, in the dressing room, but didnt learn Bengali!         
	To talk of the ongoing series, can India win from this position (2-3 down)?         
	Yes, its possible... Id say the series is wide open... India should look at the remaining matches as the semi-final and final of a tournament... Should see it only as a two-game affair... Take it that way... If Australia can make a strong comeback, after being 1-2 down, what stops us from doing the same? Having said all that, the pressure is definitely on (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni.         
	Finally, given the injuries Australia have had, arent you surprised that theyre holding the upper hand?         
	No... Actually, by accident, the Australians fielded their best XI in Hyderabad... Of course, they missed Brett Lee, but nobody else who had to go back... At times, it does happen that circumstances bring together the best combination on the park... A combination that clicks... Lets see what happens over the next few days, though.

                                                   Post for Moraad
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Arjuna award winner and Manchester Commonwealth Games (CWG) gold medalist Moraad Ali Khan has been appointed the government observer for shooting.         
	The order came into effect from February 19. I would be a conduit between the federation (National Rifle Association of India) and the government, the former double-trap shooter told The Telegraph.         
	In his new role, Khan has the responsibility to advise the NRAI on all issues and proposals concerning the sport. With Delhi set to host the Commonwealth Games, as well as a World Cup for rifle events in 2010, the first issue that Khan has to resolve is the lack of ammunition.         
	There should have been more foresight. We all, including me, are responsible for this situation, 47-year-old Khan said.

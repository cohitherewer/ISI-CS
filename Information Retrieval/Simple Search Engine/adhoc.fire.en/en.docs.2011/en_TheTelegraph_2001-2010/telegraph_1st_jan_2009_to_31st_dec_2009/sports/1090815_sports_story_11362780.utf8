The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Inzy shocked by fixing allegations
                                                   Inzy shocked by fixing allegations
                      
	Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq has called on the PCB to take action against those individuals who have made match-fixing allegations against members of the national team that toured Sri Lanka recently.         
	I want to see the Board take action against such individuals for making such irresponsible statements that have harmed Pakistans image immensely, Inzamam said in an interview.         
	Former leg-spinner Abdul Qadir who resigned as chief selector in June due to differences with the PCB, has been in the forefront to call for an inquiry into allegations of Pakistani players mixing with Indian bookies in Sri Lanka.         
	Qadir had also said he suspected some players were involved in fixing matches in Sri Lanka but later retracted stating he had only voiced concerns.         
	Former pacer Sarfaraz Nawaz had also raised the match fixing issue after Pakistans humiliating defeat in both Tests and one-day matches in the series.         
	Inzamam, who played 120 Tests, said he was shocked by such allegations.         
	Match-fixing allegations have already done Pakistan cricket a lot of harm in the past and now that the ICC anti-corruption unit has given a clean chit to our players, I urge the Board to take legal action against former players who made these accusations, he said.         
	Inzamam also made it clear that he was not in favour of having separate captains for Tests, ODIs and T20 cricket. I dont support this theory because I believe that to have continuity in the team and for players to know they have one leader, there should be only one captain for all forms of the game, he said.         
	Inzamam also stated that the PCB must look into reports off discord within the team.         
	If these reports are true that some players are creating problems for the captain or management then they should be dropped immediately, he said.           (PTI)

    - Little master to auction a days camp for noble cause             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin Tendulkar                                 
	Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar, who has been promoting The Joy of Giving Week (September 27-October 3) on television, has volunteered to auction a days coaching camp to be conducted by him.         
	Clearly, a once in a lifetime opportunity awaits the highest bidder.         
	The format of the auction is still being finalised, but the proceeds will go to Apnalaya, an NGO which has been working with the underprivileged children of Mumbai.         
	Sachin, in fact, has been associated with Apnalaya for a number of years.         
	Details will be made public in a few days... We expect a handsome response, a well-placed source in GiveIndia, an NGO coordinating the first-ever Week, told The Telegraph on Saturday.         
	Another iconic cricketer, Rahul Dravid, has pitched in: He has promised to talk on Pursuit of Excellence at a fund-raiser in hometown Bangalore.         
	Owing to Dravids India commitments, the date hasnt been worked out, though. The subject, of course, suits him perfectly.         
	According to the well-placed source, achievers in other walks of life have also offered their time or skills or resources for auction. The Love Aaj Kal team, for example, has volunteered to auction memorabilia from the film.         
	The Week, which has brought together dozens of NGOs across the country, is set to become an annual affair. Those associated with it are confident that, with time, the response is bound to be even more impressive.

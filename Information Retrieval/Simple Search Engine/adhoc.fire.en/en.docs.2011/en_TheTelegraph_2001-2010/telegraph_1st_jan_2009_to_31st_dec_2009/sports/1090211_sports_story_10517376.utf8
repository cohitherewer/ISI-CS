                                          ECB chief urges referral rethink
    London: The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chairman Giles Clarke believes that the umpire referral system used in the Stanford T20 series has its merits and that it too deserves a trial.
    Clarke said that as opposed to the International Cricket Council rsquo;s (ICC) referral system, on trial in the England vs West Indies four Test series, which undermines the authority of on-field umpires, the Stanford system allows the third umpire to intervene on his own in case of doubt. In the ICC system the players appeal against the on-field umpires rsquo; decisions.

                                                   Viru to play next match: Gambhir
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Delhi DareDevils are undoubtedly the most formidable outfit in this years Indian Premier League (IPL) and stand-in captain Gautam Gambhir says the team would be further bolstered by the return of regular captain Virender Sehwag in their next match against the Deccan Chargers on Wednesday.         
	Gambhir said Monday that his opening partner Sehwag has fully recovered from his finger injury and would be fit to play the next match.         
	He (Sehwag) will play the next game. He was 80 per cent fit for this game (against the Kolkata Knight Riders Sunday) as well. But we never wanted to risk him. We still have five games and possibly the semi-final and final. So we thought its better to have him back once he is fully fit, rather than hurrying him into the side, Gambhir said.         
	Sehwags injury has given the explosive David Warner an ideal opportunity to prove his worth and the Australian has grabbed it with both hands, making substantial contributions at the top and Gambhir feels it came as a blessing in disguise for the Delhi outfit.         
	I dont think if Viru was fit, David Warner would have fit into the XI. I think this is what the depth of this batting line-up is. We have got some very good stroke players in the side. I dont think its a headache, its a plus for us, its a bonus for our side, he said.         
	Its an advantage for us having Virender Sehwag, David Warner and Dilshan. All the three are big stroke players, Gambhir was quoted as saying by the IPLs official website.         
	Imagine the kind of batting line-up we will have when Viru gets back. If you are winning without Viru, it gives a lot of confidence to the team, he said. (PTI)

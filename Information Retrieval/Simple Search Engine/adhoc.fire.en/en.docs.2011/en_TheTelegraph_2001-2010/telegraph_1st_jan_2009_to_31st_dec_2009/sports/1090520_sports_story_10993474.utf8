	Royal Challengers Bangalores seven-wicket victory over the current table-toppers Delhi DareDevils in the Indian Premier League on Tuesday has made the race for the semi-finals even more interesting with almost all of the remaining matches becoming crucial. The Royal Challengers captain Anil Kumble said after the match that their superiority during the Powerplay overs of each innings made the difference.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Anil Kumble: Everyone chipped in today (Tuesday). We performed excellently in the first six overs  first it was Praveen Kumars burst with the ball and then it was Jacques Kallis solid effort with the bat. Its very important to put the opposition under pressure in the initial overs.         
	Virender Sehwag: The loss of early wickets brought our downfall today. We are lacking a good start and I, along with Gambhir, will have to ensure that in the next match.         
	Jacques Kallis (MoM): The seniors have to perform in the big games and I did it today.

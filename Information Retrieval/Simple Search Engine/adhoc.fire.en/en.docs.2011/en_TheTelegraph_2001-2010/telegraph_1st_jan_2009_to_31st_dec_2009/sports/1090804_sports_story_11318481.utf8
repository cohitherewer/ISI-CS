                                                   Sodhi steals show
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Ace double trap shooter Ronjan Sodhi warmed up for the upcoming Shotgun World Championships by winning the prestigious Fiocchi Cup in Maribor, Slovenia, on Sunday.         
	Ronjan, conferred the Arjuna Award this year, shot a score of 138 and was placed sixth in the finals but a brilliant final round of 48 out of 50 gave him the championship, according to a release Monday.         
	All the participants of the upcoming World Championships were competing in the Fiocchi Cup, organised by Fiocchi of Italy, one of worlds leading ammunition manufacturers.         
	The 2009 World Championships, an ISSF event, is to be held at the same venue from August 6 to 17.         
	Ronjan, who won gold in the ISSF World Cup in Belgrade last year with a world record-equalling score, could have won a Mercedes Benz by repeating that performance.         
	Nevertheless, he still pocketed prize money of euros 8000 and a gold shotgun cartridge.

                                                   Sponsor worry for Nehru Cup
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: At a time when the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is planning to provide maximum international exposure to the national team, it is not yet sure whether the sponsors of the Nehru Cup would once again back the tournament.         
	In the recent meeting of the senior officials of the federation, the general secretary, Alberto Colaco, said that ONGC were yet to respond to AIFFs offer of sponsoring the Nehru Cup for the second consecutive time. The tournament is scheduled to be held in Delhi in August this year.         
	Under the Goal 2011 project, the AIFF has chalked out a plan to arrange 40 international matches for the national team, which includes playing four tournaments. The Nehru Cup is a vital part of our plans for the 2011 Asia Cup, an official said.         
	Sources in the ONGC, however, said the decision about sponsoring the Nehru Cup would remain suspended till the elections are over.

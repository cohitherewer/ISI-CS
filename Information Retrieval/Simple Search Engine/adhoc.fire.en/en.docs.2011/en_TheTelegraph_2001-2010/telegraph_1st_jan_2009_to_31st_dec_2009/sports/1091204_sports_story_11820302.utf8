The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vettori spell checks Pak

	Wellington: New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori ensured that the hosts were in control at the end of the first days play in the second Test against Pakistan here Thursday.         
	The Black Caps bowlers exploited the overcast conditions to restrict Pakistan to 161 for six on the opening day. Acco rding to cricinfo, Vettori scalped three for 42 while pacer Daryl Tuffey bagged two for 32. Umar Akmal was the top scorer for Pakistan with 46.         
	Pakistan made two changes to their batting order after the debacle in the first Test, bringing in Salman Butt and Misbah-ul-Haq.         
	But for Pakistan it was the same old story of uncertain prods outside off, awkward encounters with short balls, airy swishes and brain-dead shots.         
	Openers Butt and Imran Farhat had made Vettoris decision to bowl first look misguided early.         
	Chris Martin and Tuffey  looking every inch a man returning to Tests after nearly five years  had been tight, nothing more. Nothing moved off the pitch and the bounce was true and good.         
	It was only after that break, however, that New Zealand finally got into the act with Martin, Tuffey and Iain Brien returning to more basic plans.         
	Tuffey bowled short, and Brien reaped the benefit, Butt pulling loosely straight up to the skies.         
	The impressive Umar Akmal was thrown in at one-down. Just when he seemed to be settling, however, Tuffey undid him with a peach that hit off.

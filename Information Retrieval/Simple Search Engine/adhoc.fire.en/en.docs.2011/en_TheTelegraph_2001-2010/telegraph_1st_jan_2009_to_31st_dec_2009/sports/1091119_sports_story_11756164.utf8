The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sulking Kimi takes break
                                                                                                                                   Sulking Kimi takes break
            THE TIMES, LONDON                      
	Kimi Raikkonen will take a year out of Formula One after he failed to reach a deal with McLaren for next season, according to Steve Robertson, the 2007 world champions manager.         
	The alternatives at F1 level for next season were McLaren or nothing, Robertson said. Kimi and McLaren did not reach an agreement, so he will not drive at F1 level at least during next year.         
	Raikkonen, who spent five years at McLaren before joining Ferrari at the end of 2006, announced that he would quit the Italian team before the end of last season even though he had a year to run on his contract. He has been replaced by Fernando Alonso.         
	Raikkonen had cast doubt on his Formula One future, saying last month that any contract he signed would have to allow him to continue rallying. He competed in this years Finnish round of the World Rally Championship and entered three non-championship events.         
	Kimi still lives and breathes the ambition to drive, Robertson said. A year off in that sense does not mean anything. More significant is to find a place for Kimi where he can fight for victory and a world championship.         
	Raikkonen had made it clear that he wanted to drive only for a top team. If I do decide to stay in Formula One, I wouldnt go to any of the small teams where I would not have the chance to fight for the championship, he said.         
	Toyota had made Raikkonen an offer but have since quit Formula One while Red Bull, runners-up last season, have Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber under contract. Brawn, were unlikely to meet the Finns salary demands.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United aim to carry form
                                                     United aim to carry form
                  Kaka                     
	Moscow: Manchester United are unconcerned about playing on an artificial pitch for Wednesdays Champions League match at CSKA Moscow; the club would rather worry about missing the talismanic Wayne Rooney and the tireless Ryan Giggs, among others, for the Group B tie. Real Madrid and AC Milan, opponents in a Group C fixture at the Bernabeu, too, would be bothered by similar problems although Kaka should be back in the Real starting line-up to face his former club.         
	Moscows game will be played at Luzhniki Stadium, the ground where United manager Alex Ferguson lifted his second Champions League trophy almost 18 months ago when the Red Devils beat Chelsea on penalties. That match was played on a patchwork field of real grass, but the stadium will have its regular plastic surface this time.         
	Ferguson  whose team lead Group B with two wins from two games  is without a number of key players for the match. Rooney injured a calf muscle during Englands 0-1 loss in Ukraine last week, while midfielder Giggs and left back Patrice Evra picked up injuries against Bolton on Saturday.         
	The injured Park Ji-sung and Darren Fletcher have been left out with Sundays league match against Liverpool looming.         
	There are also concerns over defender Nemanja Vidic and striker Dimitar Berbatov, who could face his former manager at Tottenham in CSKA coach Juande Ramos.         
	Berbatov, if declared fit, and Michael Owen will be vying for a place in attack, while Jonny Evans and John Shea offer options in defence with Evra, and possibly Vidic, out.         
	In Madrid, with Cristiano Ronaldo sidelined, Real will expect a match-winning performance from Kaka who was used as a second-half substitute in Saturdays 4-2 La Liga win over Valladolid.         
	But midfielder Lassana Diarra and defender Alvaro Arbeloa have shaken off injuries and should be available for Wednesdays match, coach Manuel Pellegrini said. (AP)

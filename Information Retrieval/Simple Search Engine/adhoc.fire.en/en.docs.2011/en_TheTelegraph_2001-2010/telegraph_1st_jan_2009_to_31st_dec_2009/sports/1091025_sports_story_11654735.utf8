The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tough battle ahead, says Gilchrist
                                                   Tough battle ahead, says Gilchrist
                      
	Chennai: Former Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist expects the seven-match ODI series between India and Australia starting Sunday to be a tough and hard-fought contest with the home team looking to make amends of their Champions Trophy debacle.         
	I would love to say 7-0 result for Australia but I dont think that is going to be easy. It is going to be a tough, hard-fought contest. India would be very keen to make amends for their early exit from Champions Trophy while Australia would be keen to maintain their number one position in ODIs, Gilchrist said here Saturday.         
	Gilchrist said Australia would start as favourites at the back of their Champions Trophy triumph but warned that India have the capability to turn the table. There has been a very healthy and fierce rivalry between the two teams in recent times. It is always intriguing to watch India-Australia encounters, Gilchrist, captain of the Deccan Chargers, said.         
	Historically, Australia has not lost any one-day series in India in the last 10 years. They start as the favourites, but we have also come as favourites for Test series a few times but had returned empty handed. India play their conditions very well and I am sure they will be determined to turn around their recent results, said Gilchrist on a university promotional tour.         
	In an apparent reference to the racism row involving Harbhajan Singh and Andrew Symonds during Indias last tour to Australia, Gilchrist said: though there were some incidents that gained attention they are things of the past.

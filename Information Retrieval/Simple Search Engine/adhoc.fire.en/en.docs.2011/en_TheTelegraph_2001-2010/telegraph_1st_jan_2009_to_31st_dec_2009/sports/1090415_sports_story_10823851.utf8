                                                   Botha is under scanner
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Tuesday confirmed that South Africa off-spinner Johan Botha has been reported for a suspected illegal action following the completion of the fourth ODI between Australia and South Africa in Port Elizabeth on Monday.         
	The report was made by the two on-field umpires, Brian Jerling and Asoka de Silva, along with third umpire Rudi Koertzen. Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle has informed both the ICC and the South Africa team management of the report. The umpires report cited concerns over two types of deliveries employed by Botha, his quicker ball and the doosra.         
	Standard procedures under the ICC regulations for the review of bowlers reported with suspected illegal bowling actions will now come into effect. The player will undergo independent analysis of his action by a member of the ICCs panel of human movement specialists. This will take place within a maximum period of 21 days from receipt of the formal notice of the report by Cricket South Africa (CSA).

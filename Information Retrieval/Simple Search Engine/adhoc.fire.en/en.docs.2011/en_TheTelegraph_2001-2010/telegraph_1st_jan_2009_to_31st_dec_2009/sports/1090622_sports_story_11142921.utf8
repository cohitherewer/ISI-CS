    - Pakistan captain quits T20 after lifting World cup             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	London: Pakistan had much bigger names in 1992 and the World Cup was then the trophy to possess. Yet, the significance of the World T20 win, on Sunday, is probably greater.         
	For one, it has come when suicide attacks in Pakistan are as frequent as big hits from Shahid Afridi.         
	There were, in fact, quite a few in the tournament.         
	Then, the success has come at a time when Pakistan is being pushed around within the International Cricket Council, made to feel a pariah.         
	As an elated Younis Khan received the trophy at Lords, which had been wrapped in green, or almost, the message was clear: Cricket needed Pakistan as much as Pakistan needed it.         
	Unpredictable or not.         
	A decade ago, by the way, Pakistan had lost the (50-over) World Cup final to Australia at the very same address.         
	For me, the 1992 win (under Imran Khan) will probably mean more because it was our first on the world stage... However, this one too is awesome, coach Intikhab Alam told The Telegraph moments after the all-important 139th-run came off a leg-bye.         
	Intikhab, the oldest around in the trade, had been the coach in 1992 as well.         
	Predictably, Younis dedicated the success first to his compatriots and, then, to the late Bob Woolmer.         
	We know that in these times we needed a win like this, in a World Cup... Its a gift for our whole nation, Younis said, adding that he was also dedicating it to the memory of somebody whod been a source of strength in difficult times  Woolmer.         
	This final must go to Bob... He was doing good work with us and wouldve been very proud if he was still alive... He was like a father-figure...         
	After being politically correct  Imran, it may be recalled, got criticised for talking of his cancer hospital project after collecting the Benson amp; Hedges World Cup  Younis stunned everybody by announcing he was quitting T20 cricket.         
	There had been whispers that he wasnt that keen on the format and, then, couldve been irritated by barbs directed at him by the Abdul Qadirs.         
	Where Sri Lankas concerned, former captain Arjuna Ranatungas worst fears came true. The other day hed been apprehensive that the semi-final or final may turn out to be the one bad day.         
	Indeed, Sri Lankas unbeaten run ended when it hurt the most and captain Kumar Sangakkara was left ruing the poor show in the first six overs both while batting and bowling.         
	While Sri Lanka stumbled to 34 for four in their first six, they couldnt get a single wicket as Pakistan reached 39 in theirs.         
	Barring acts of individual brilliance at a later stage, the first six overs have come to be defining moments in T20.         
	Kamran Akmal, who played a huge role in Pakistans success, thanked Allah in an exclusive chat with this newspaper.         
	Yeh sab Allah ki dua hai... Allah hi jaanta hai meri khushi kitni hai... Im too overwhelmed to say anything else...         
	Incidentally, bowling coach Aaquib Javed was a member of the playing XI which made history in 1992.         
	Of course, Im very happy for the country and the players... Actually, this is my third World Cup win, as Id been the coach when the U-19s won in 2004, Aaquib pointed out.         
	Hes my right hand, quipped Intikhab as the time came for the presentations and a lap of honour which saw security being breached by fans high on a shaandaar jeet.         
	Footnote: Sunil Gavaskar, meanwhile, complimented Younis and Co. Its a success well deserved... As in 1992, the team was slow to start in this tournament... One Khan did it then, another did it this evening...

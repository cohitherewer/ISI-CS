The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tamim stars in Bangla victory
                                                   Tamim stars in Bangla victory
                      
	Dhaka: Tamim Iqbal hit 80 runs off 72 balls as Bangladesh cruised to a four-wicket victory over Zimbabwe to take a 2-1 lead in the five-match one day International series here Saturday.         
	Zimbabwes weakness against spin was exposed as the visitors were bundled out for 196 in 41.1 overs with left-arm spinner Enamul Haque picking up three vital wickets.         
	In reply, Tamim made a brilliant half century and Mohammed Ashraful (63) returned to form to guide the hosts to victory in 40.4 overs.         
	Tamim, who was declared the Man of the Match, said he rued missing the century.         
	I am not happy. I did not complete the job. But the boys are playing good cricket. We are hopeful for the remaining matches, he said.         
	Bangladesh skipper Shakib-al Hasan elected to field. Zimbabwe captain Hamilton Masakadza gave the visitors a rollicking start.

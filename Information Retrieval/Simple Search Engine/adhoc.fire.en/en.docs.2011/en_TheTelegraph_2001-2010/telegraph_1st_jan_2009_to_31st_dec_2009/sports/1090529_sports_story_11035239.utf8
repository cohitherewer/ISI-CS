                                                   Paes, Black in Round II
                      
	Paris: Second-seeded Leander Paes and Cara Black overcame a sluggish start to book a second round berth in the mixed doubles event of the French Open, scoring a 6-3, 6-3 win over Virginie Razzano and Jeff Coetzee here on Thursday.         
	After trading early breaks and squandering many breakpoints in the first set, the Indo-Zimbabwean pair raised their game and closed the match in style. Paes-Black wasted as many as three breakpoints in the first set and dropped their serve once but did not give any chance to their opponents in the second.         
	They broke the French-South African pair twice in the second set and saved one of the two breakpoints to progress to the next round.         
	They will next take on the winners of the match between Dominika Cibulkova/Filip Polasek and Sybille Bammer/Lukasz Kubot.         
	In the mens doubles, Paes and his Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy sailed into the second round with a straight-set win over Sebastien de Chaunac and Benoit Paire. (PTI)

                                                   Shukla retained captain
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Laxmi Ratan Shukla was retained captain of the Bengal squad for the Ranji Trophy after the senior selection committee meeting at the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) Tuesday.         
	However, the CAB didnt clarify whether the appointment was for the full term or for the first two matches  against Maharashtra in Pune from November 3 and against Baroda at home from November 10.         
	When asked, CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey said: We needed to select a captain before the selection of the team. Hence, Laxmi was retained after todays meeting. That is all I have to say.         
	The selection of the Bengal squad for the ensuing Ranji Trophy, however, was in doldrums after the selectors failed to arrive at a common consensus at the meeting. According to sources, the selectors had differences of opinion on the inclusion of certain senior players in the squad and hence the CAB wanted to buy time before taking at a decision.         
	While a certain section wanted to drop a few non-performing seniors and include youngsters, the others opposed the move.         
	Dey though begged to differ: The squad couldnt be selected today because we wanted the coach, Roger Binny, to be present at the meeting. He is away due to personal reasons and will be arriving tomorrow (Wednesday). Along with the coach, captain and the selectors, president Jagmohan Dalmiya will also be present at the meeting.         
	He added: The coach certainly wants to give some inputs before the team is selected and we have to respect that. That is the reason why we didnt select the team today.         
	The presence of the president, who didnt attend Tuesdays meeting, for Wednesday indicates that he might take the final call over the selection.

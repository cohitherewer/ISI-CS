The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SRK receives hate mail
                                                     SRK receives hate mail
                  Knight Riders principal owner Shah Rukh Khan watches the match in Durban on Tuesday                     
	Durban: The Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) principal owner Shah Rukh Khan Tuesday revealed he has been receiving strange hate mails for stripping Sourav Ganguly of the KKR captaincy.         
	I get strange hate mails from people for taking a decision for the teams sake, Shah Rukh said after the Knights tasted their first win of IPL 2009 against Kings XI Punjab Tuesday.         
	But that is okay, Im saving them all so that I can go to each house and say (the KKR anthem) Korbo, Lorbo, Jeetbo..., he added.         
	In a fervent plea to the Calcuttans to stand by KKR, Shah Rukh said: Along the way if we go wrong, please feel for us and send us positive energies.         
	Arguably the most hyped IPL franchise, KKR has been in news this year ever since coach John Buchanan floated the multiple captains theory, which many in Calcutta saw as yet another Australian ploy to strip local favourite Sourav of the captaincy.         
	Buchanans idea was eventually shelved but Sourav didnt retain his job either as KKR named New Zealand stumper Brendon McCullum as their new captain, a decision that did not go down well in Calcutta.         
	Shah Rukh said it was not easy pleasing people in Calcutta where emotions run high and admitted there was tremendous pressure on the team.         
	We are under a lot of pressure. We are a hyped team because the owners are from the film industry and because we have the most passionate city backing us, the Bollywood actor said.         
	For good and bad, the Calcuttans love us one night and one night they get angry with our decisions. But I promise you guys that the dream I have is to come to Calcutta with the IPL trophy and dance. Will do some new steps for Korbo, Lorbo, Jeetbo, he said.         
	Incidentally, Sourav played a cameo in Tuesdays win with two quick wickets even though he didnt get a chance to bat.         
	Shah Rukh took the occasion to pledge his support for Sourav and said that for him, the former India captain remained the greatest KKR player.         
	I want him to be the Player of the Tournament this year. Whoever feels he is not given importance in the team, let me tell you that for me, he is the greatest Knight Riders player. He and (Chris) Gayle will compete for the Player of the Tournament award, he said.         
	Dwelling on Tuesdays win against the Kings XI Punjab  which came via Duckworth-Lewis Method  Shah Rukh admitted it came as a huge relief.         
	Its nice to be here. This is surely not the best way to win a game but a win is a win nevertheless.         
	I understand that we are a team under pressure. With multiple captains, choice of captain and the way we played the first game were signs of a team in disarray. But we know we will stick together. Its good we started coming together, he said.           (PTI)

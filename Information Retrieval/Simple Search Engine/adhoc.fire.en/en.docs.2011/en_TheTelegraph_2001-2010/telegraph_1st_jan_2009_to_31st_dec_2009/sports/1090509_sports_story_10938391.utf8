The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Abbasi wants the PCB to be less emotional and more practical
                                                     Abbasi wants the PCB to be less emotional and more practical
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Arif Ali Khan Abbasi                           
	Dubai: Arif Ali Khan Abbasi, a former chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and one of the most respected administrators in the subcontinent, has called on the present dispensation to be less emotional and more practical about matters after the 3/3 attack in Lahore.         
	Today, theres no choice but to be less emotional and more practical about where we stand in relation to world cricket... Weve got to wait till memories recede and, then, take it up from there, Abbasi, a Royal Box invitee for Thursdays T20 International here, told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Friday, Abbasi, whod also been a minister in Sindhs interim government before the February 2008 elections, added: Sri Lankas tour earlier this year was an absolute test for us and, while security is the governments responsibility, the PCB shouldve ensured it actually was of the Presidential type... Failure to do so resulted in crickets 3/3... We let everybody, including ourselves, down.         
	Abbasi, an architect of the successful hosting of the 1996 World Cup in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, said he wasnt convinced that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had played an active role in Pakistan losing the 2011 World Cups co-host status.               
	Abbasi expressed disappointment at the International Cricket Councils inability to see to it that the FTP, which drives bilateral series, is followed. Whats the point of grand announcements when things dont get implemented on the ground? The world body has too many people doing too little... In fact, Im sorry to say, its the same with the PCB, he signed off, preparing to leave for Karachi.         
	Incidentally, Abbasi maintained its a contradiction to insist that a neutral venue could be treated as home if teams refuse to play in a particular country.

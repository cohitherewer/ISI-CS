The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shilton saves Bagan   blushes
                                                                                                                                   Shilton saves Bagan   blushes
                            
	Margao: Mohun Bagan goalkeeper Shilton Pauls fine saves denied Sporting Clube de Goa their first win in the ongoing I-League as they were held to a 2-2 draw in a seventh round match at the Nehru stadium Saturday.         
	The Goans, who dominated major part of the match, took the lead in the 23rd minute through Nathaniel Amos. Branco Cardozo restored parity in the 33rd minute while Marcos Pereira put Bagan ahead in the 42nd minute. However, Man of the Match Joseph Pareira equalised for the Goans in the 43rd minute.         
	Both the teams started at slow pace but the tempo picked up in the second-half. Joseph Pereira, who was more enterprising on the left, troubled the Mohun Bagan defence and came near scoring twice in the second-half, but could not beat Shilton.         
	The second-half entirely belonged to Sporting who probed more and came close to scoring at least on three occasions but Shilton saved the day for Bagan making brilliant saves off Bisheshwar Singh and Joseph Pereira twice. Bagan now have 10 points from seven matches, while Sporting have three from six.

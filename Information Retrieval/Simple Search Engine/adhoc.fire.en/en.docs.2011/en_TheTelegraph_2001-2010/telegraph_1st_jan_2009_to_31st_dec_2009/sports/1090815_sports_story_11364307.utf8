                                                     Selectors inclined to pick a common squad of 15 
    - Rahul dravid looks set for a recall; Amit Mishra is in the reckoning             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                Sehwag,Dravid                                  
	Calcutta: The national selectors, it seems, are looking to pick a common squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy to be hosted by South Africa.         
	If that does happen, in Chennai on Sunday morning, then it can more or less be taken for granted that Virender Sehwag wont be in the Team India 15.         
	While the tri-series is from September 8-14, the Champions Trophy will be held between September 22-October 5.         
	The selectors (Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Yashpal Sharma, Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave, Raja Venkat) have quite a soft corner for Sehwag... Having said that, hes still in the rehab stage after his shoulder surgery...         
	Sehwag hasnt played any cricket after the third week of May (not since the IPL) and it probably wouldnt be fair on him and on the team, as well, if he straightaway gets selected for the high-pressure Champions Trophy, a well-placed source told The Telegraph on Friday evening.         
	Reinstated as the vice-captain last November, Sehwag had to be pulled out of the World T20 squad in England. All because of an injury to his right shoulder during the IPL.         
	The well-placed source suggested that former captain Rahul Dravids ODI comeback may just get linked to the Sehwag issue.         
	Look, Dravid has made the 30 probables for the Champions Trophy, but hes not exactly assured of a place in the 15 if the selectors decide to gamble on Sehwag... Dravid will definitely be there if Sehwags return to international cricket isnt rushed... The latter scenario is, of course, much more likely, the well-placed source pointed out.         
	Significantly, at a function in New Delhi, Sehwag himself didnt sound confident about quickly regaining match fitness.         
	The 36-year-old Dravids last ODI appearance was as far back as October 2007. In todays cricket, it really is a long time.         
	Senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkar, who made himself unavailable for the four-match ODI series in the West Indies, in June-July, will be back.         
	Indications are that Suresh Raina, too, will make the 15. An injury had kept him away from the West Indies.         
	Sachin and Raina should come in for Subramaniam Badrinath and Ravindra Jadeja, respectively. For Dravid to return, Rohit Sharma would have to be dropped.         
	Rohit needs a bit of a shake-up... He hasnt done well in recent times and has probably begun to take his place for granted, the well-placed source remarked.         
	Medium-pacer Praveen Kumar and left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha, one gathers, are under some pressure.         
	Munaf Patel appears to be breathing down Kumars neck, while leggie Amit Mishra, who was outstanding in the recent Emerging Players meet in Australia, is pushing Ojha hard.         
	With Zaheer Khan not available, the XI could do with a wicket-taking bowler... Mishra is exactly that... So, at this moment, he stands a very fair chance of making the 15, is how the well-placed source put it.         
	Mishra, who made his Test debut last October, hasnt played an ODI for well over six years.         
	Totally out of the reckoning is Murali Vijay, whod featured in the Team India 16 which went to the West Indies less than two months ago.         
	Vijay, to say the least, had been lucky then.   
	LIKELY 15 FOR Sri Lanka, CHAMPIONS TROPHY  Mahendra Singh Dhoni (capt.), Yuvraj Singh (vice-capt.), Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Dinesh Karthik, Yusuf Pathan, Avishek Nayar, Harbhajan Singh, Amit Mishra/Pragyan Ojha, Ashish Nehra, Rudra Pratap Singh, Ishant Sharma, Praveen Kumar/Munaf Patel.
    Note: As of Friday evening

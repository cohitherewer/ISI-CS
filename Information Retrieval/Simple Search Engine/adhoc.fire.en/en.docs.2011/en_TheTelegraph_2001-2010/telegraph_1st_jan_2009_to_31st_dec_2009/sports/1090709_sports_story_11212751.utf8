The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | East Bengal strike off unwilling Snehasish
                                                   East Bengal strike off unwilling Snehasish
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick on Wednesday named a squad of 33 footballers for the upcoming season which included Bhaichung Bhutia but did not feature Snehasish Chakrabarty.         
	The coach said that the squad for the upcoming season was finalised barring a couple of changes. Bhowmick will leave for Puri on July 17 with the squad for a 21-day pre- season conditioning camp.         
	I am very happy with the squad. The club had given me full responsibility and authority to select the squad and I think we have a very balanced side this time, Bhowmick said.         
	Asked on the inclusion of Bhaichung, whose ongoing impasse with Mohun Bagan will be heard at the governing body meeting on Thursday, Bhowmick said: See I am always ready to wait for a player of his stature. He is an icon. I am hopeful that the club will be able to get his services this season.         
	The club is also trying to organise five practice matches in Rajsahi, Bangladesh, after returning from the Puri camp.         
	Asked about the omission of Snehasish from the squad, Bhowmick shot back: I have always said I dont want unwilling horses. I have dropped him from the squad Now the club will decide on him.         
	Snehasish, incidentally, had alleged that East Bengal has forged his signature.         
	Bhowmick named five foreigners in the squad, including one of Asian origin, in the squad of 33.         
	Ghanaian Yusif Yakubu and Brazilian Edmilson Marquez are the known faces. Argentine striker Sebastian Omar Monesterolo, Czech Republics central midfielder Jan Berger and Lebanese defender Ramez Dayoub (Asian origin) are the other foreigners.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Irate Kalmadi wants Games CEO out
                                                   Irate Kalmadi wants Games CEO out
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The confrontation between the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) and the organising committee for the 2010 New Delhi Games came out in the open Thursday when Suresh Kalmadi asked for the immediate replacement of Games CEO Mike Hooper.         
	Addressing a news conference, Kalmadi, who is the chairman of the organising committee, said: Hooper should be sent back to London. He has not been beneficial to the organising committee and is of no use to us. The CGF should replace him immediately.         
	Launching a scathing personal attack on Hooper, Kalmadi, who is also the president of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), said: Hooper, in fact, is an impediment to the smooth functioning of the organising committee.         
	Making no secret of his unwillingness to accept CGF president Michael Fennells recent announcement that a technical committee would be formed to monitor the preparations of the Games, Kalmadi said he was against setting up of a review team by the CGF.         
	I am willing to take any expert suggested by the CGF into our coordination committee, but we feel there is no need to impose an additional technical committee upon us, Kalmadi said.         
	There is no need for a separate monitoring agency. If they want they can add some technical experts to the coordination commission which is already monitoring the work, Kalmadi added.         
	For quite some time now, the organising committee for the New Delhi Games has been facing widespread criticism for the slow pace of preparations. So much so that Fennell went on record saying Melbourne was prepared to host the Games as per the plan B of the CGF.         
	Fennell even went to the extent of writing to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last month requesting him to intervene so that the Games could be held on time.         
	According to a senior IOA official, the executive committee of the body, which met on Wednesday, decided to suggest that the organising committee should not pay the salaries of the technical experts to be appointed by the CGF.         
	Let the CGF take care of all these foreigners. Why should the organising committee be burdened with such unnecessary expenses, the official said.         
	When asked, Hooper described Kalmadis comments as unfortunate and inappropriate.         
	I am very disappointed to hear the comments by Kalmadi. Its his view. I view that my role here has been independent in the last two years. It seems I was in a position to seriously address the real issues. Launching a personal attack was most unfortunate. To me its unfortunate and totally inappropriate, said the CEO.

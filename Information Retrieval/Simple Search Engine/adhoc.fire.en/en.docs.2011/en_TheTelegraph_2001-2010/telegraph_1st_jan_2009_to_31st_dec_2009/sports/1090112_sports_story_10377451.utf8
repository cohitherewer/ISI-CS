The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shark remains in hunt for Masters
                                                     Shark remains in hunt for Masters
            Mark Reason            Greg Norman                           
	When Greg Norman drives up Magnolia Lane for the first time in seven years, it will be like Joe Frazier jogging back into the boxing ring in Manila or Donald Bradman walking out onto the pitch at the Oval for one more final innings.         
	These places are haunted by the failure of the great ones. Earlier this week, Normans qualification for the 2009 Masters through his third-place finish at last years Open was confirmed. The hills of Augusta still shimmer with the roars for Jack and Tiger, but in many ways the modern Masters is defined by the men who lost. And no one lost more magnificently than Norman.         
	In 2003, Justin Rose, Trevor Immelman and Adam Scott were interviewed ahead of the Masters.         
	Immelman, this years defending champion, said: I remember watching in 1986 when Nicklaus won (and Norman finished second).         
	Scott: 1987 was when Larry Mize chipped in against Greg.         
	Immelman: A lot of my memories are of Norman: 1986 was Norman, 1987 was Norman. He was involved a lot.         
	Scott: I went to the Royal Queensland breakfast in 1996. Thats where Greg grew up. The people couldnt watch because everyone there had known Greg for 30 years.         
	Rose: I saw more someone winning a tournament [Faldo] more than someone losing one.         
	The 2003 Masters was the first that Norman would not play since 1980, the year that Rose and Scott were born. People expected the Aussie to receive a special invitation to return. Norman just shrugged and accepted his exclusion with typical good grace.         
	Now he is coming back. Norman started practising for this years Masters on December 1, 2008. Do you think the Great White is practising to put on a good show, or because he genuinely thinks that he can win? My money is on the latter. At the age of 54, Norman will believe that he can win his first Masters.         
	Perhaps the notion is not quite as preposterous as it sounds. Norman has not played Augusta since they started toughening it up. The Aussie is one of the greatest drivers of a golf ball of all time and, as he proved at last years Open, he can still compete when the going gets tough enough.         
	While his wife Chris Evert tossed and turned on that anxious Saturday night, Norman says that he slept well. Win or lose, he knew that he was not on hostile ground. The Open had given the Shark his three greatest moments in golf. But you wonder if he will be quite so laid-back if he leads the Masters on the night of April 11, 2009.

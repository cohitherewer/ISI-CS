The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni wages a lone battle
                                                   Dhoni wages a lone battle
                      
	Kingston: Mahendra Singh Dhoni waged a lone battle with a defiant 95 as India recovered from a collapse to reach 188 against the West Indies in the second one-dayer here Sunday.         
	Dhoni stitched together a record 101-run partnership for the ninth wicket with RP Singh to lead Indias recovery, after they were reduced to 82 for eight in 22 overs.                     
	The West Indies were 23 without loss after five overs. Runako Morton and Chris Gayle were batting on 8 and 11, respectively.                     
	The Indian batting collapsed like a house of cards against a pace attack led by Ravi Rampaul, who produced career-best figures of 10-2-37-4, and Jerome Taylor, who grabbed three for 35.         
	Rampaul combined with Taylor to rip through the Indian top-order, before joining hands with Dwayne Bravo (3/26) to polish off the tail.         
	With a 1-0 lead in the four-match series, Dhoni won the toss and elected to bat first but his decision backfired as India lost half their side inside 15 overs with three batsmen going for a duck.         
	The visitors had a pathetic start, losing Dinesh Karthik (4), Gautam Gambhir (0) and Rohit Sharma (0) for eight in 1.4 overs.         
	Playing his first match in the series, pacer Rampaul struck twice in his first over but it was his partner Taylor who drew first blood, removing Karthik in the fifth ball of the innings.         
	 After India struggled to 82 for eight in 21.4 overs, a 101-run ninth-wicket stand between Dhoni and RP Singh took India to a respectable total.         
	Two days ago, 658 runs were scored on the same Sabina Park pitch by the same set of batsmen, but the early swing exposed the Indians technical flaws.         
	 There was a personal milestone for Denesh Ramdin, who took five catches.         
	Rampaul removed Gambhir and Rohit in the second over, both chasing wide deliveries. Karthik fell in Taylors first over and then Rohit chased a wide outswinger. Ramdin went too hard at the catch, but second slip took the rebound.         
	Yuvraj Singh was promising another treat. By the end of 12 overs, India seemed to have weathered the storm, momentarily. Yuvraj reached 35 off 32, as opposed to Dhonis 11 off 31. It was fine until then, because the partnership read 47 off 62.         
	But Taylor wasnt done yet. He was asked to bowl his seventh over on the trot, and he got Yuvraj with the first ball. Back came Rampaul, in came a leg gully and a slip, and out came the open secret: the bouncers.         
	After an edgy nine-ball stay, Yusuf Pathan edged an accurate bouncer from Dwayne Bravo. Ravindra Jadeja repeated his dismissal from the first match, pushing at a delivery away from his body.         
	After the second slump of the innings, India stood at 70 for six, and Dhoni stood looking for some support.         
	Harbhajan Singh and Praveen Kumar fell to flashy shots, and soon India were 82 for eight. Rampauls fourth wicket came in his 10th over, a maiden, and Taylor and Bravo were nearing the completion of their quotas as well.         
	The new Dhoni, the more circumspect Dhoni, has come in for some criticism of late, but his methods came in handy this time.         
	He wasnt in the cleanest of touches, but took charge of the rescue work. The West Indies, on their part, seemed content in limiting the damage before Taylor and Bravo came back.         
	The period of recovery for India resembled a Test match. RP was happy to watch from the other end. RPs first run came off the 13th ball he faced, but the partnership had reached 21 by then. Dhoni gradually changed gear and neared what would have been a fifth century.         
	By the time RP got out for a career-best 23, the two had put together a century ninth-wicket stand for only the fifth time in ODI history.         
	But by then, Bravo and Taylor had also come back, ending the innings swiftly and making sure India didnt play their full quota. Dhoni was the last to go, to a perfect slower from Taylor in the 49th over.         
	The third ODI of the four-match series will be played on Friday.           (AGENCIES)

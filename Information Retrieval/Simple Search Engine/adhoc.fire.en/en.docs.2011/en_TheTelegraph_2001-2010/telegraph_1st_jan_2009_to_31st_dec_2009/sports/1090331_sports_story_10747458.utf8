	Bridgetown: Andrew Strauss gathered 79 from 61 balls to lead England to a nine-wicket victory under the Duckworth-Lewis Method over the West Indies in the rain-affected fourth ODI at Kensington Oval.         
	A two-hour long rain delay left the tourists with a victory target of 135 from 20 overs Sunday. The five-ODI series is now tied 2-2.           (AFP)

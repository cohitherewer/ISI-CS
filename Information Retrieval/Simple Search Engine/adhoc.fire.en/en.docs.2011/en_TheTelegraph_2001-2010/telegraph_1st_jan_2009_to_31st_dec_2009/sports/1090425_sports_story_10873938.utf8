                  Salman Butt en route to his 57 on Friday                     
	Dubai: Australia put in a disciplined bowling performance Friday to dismiss Pakistan for 207 in the second of five one-day Internationals.               
	Australia reached the target in 45.1 overs, with six wickets in hand. Andrew Symonds scored 58 while James Hopes hit 48.               
	Batting first after captain Younis Khan won the toss and leading 1-0 in the series, Pakistan never got going as wickets fell at regular intervals at the Dubai Sports City cricket stadium. They were eventually bowled out in the 47th over.         
	Spinners Nathan Hauritz and Andrew Symonds took a total of five wickets, and the fast bowlers were difficult to score runs from. Opener Salman Butt top-scored with 57 off 112 balls before becoming one of Hauritzs three victims. It was left to some late hitting from Shahid Afridi (41 from 40 balls), and Shoaib Akhtar (25 in 14 balls) to ensure Pakistan crossed the 200 mark.         
	Hauritz also dismissed Misbah-ul-Haq on 12 after he reverse-swept and David Hussey took a diving catch at short third-man, and former captain Shoaib Malik, who edged a delivery onto his ankle on 7 and wicketkeeper Brad Haddin caught the ricochet.         
	Hauritz finished with three for 41 off his 10 overs, while Symonds took two for 12 and James Hopes two for 45.         
	Afridi hit five boundaries and a six before being caught by Haddin off Hopes.           (AP)

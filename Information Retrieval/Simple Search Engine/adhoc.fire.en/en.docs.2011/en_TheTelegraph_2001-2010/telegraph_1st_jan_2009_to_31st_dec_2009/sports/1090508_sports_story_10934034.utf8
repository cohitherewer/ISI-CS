The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvis heroics go in vain
                                                   Yuvis heroics go in vain
                      
	Centurion: Yuvraj Singhs unbeaten 58-run blitzkrieg turned out to be an exercise in futility for the Kings XI Punjab as the Chennai Super Kings survived some torrid moments before eking out a 12-run win in the Indian Premier League here on Thursday.         
	Chasing a mammoth 187 runs from 18 overs under the Duckworth-Lewis method, the Punjab side eventually managed 174 for three, largely due to Yuvraj (58 not out), Simon Katich (50) and Mahela Jayawardene (44 not out).         
	Hayden slammed a 58-ball 89 and Dhoni hammered an unbeaten 56 off just 27 balls as the Chennai outfit posted a mammoth 185 for three in the rain-marred tie, which was reduced to 18-overs-a-side following a 90-minute rain interruption.         
	Albie Morkel castled Sunny Sohal (2) with the second ball of the innings and Shadab Jakatis second delivery too turned out to be a wicket-taking one, accounting for Karan Goel (14) as the Kings XI stumbled early on in their chase.         
	Simon Katich (50) decided to take the attack to the bowlers and the result was three sixes in a row off Manpreet Gonys first over.         
	Jakati also copped some punishment before catching the left-hander near the ropes.           (PTI)

                  Safina                     
	Los Angeles: An annoyed Dinara Safina has had enough of people questioning whether she can justify being the world number one, despite not having won a Grand Slam title.         
	The Russian bristled at the Los Angeles Championships on Monday when asked about world number two Serena Williamss comments that she was the peoples number one as she holds the US, Australian Open and Wimbledon titles.         
	I didnt do the ranking system, said Safina. If she has questions, she can give these questions to the WTA who is doing the ranking system.         
	Its the result of how you play the whole year, not just the four Grand Slams. Ive been playing the whole year and Ive been having great results all through the Grand Slams.         
	Safina has won at Rome, Madrid and Portorotz and reached the Australian Open and the French Open finals, as well as the Wimbledon semi-finals this year.         
	However, she has been thrashed in all of those Grand Slam matches, to Serena at the Australian Open, to Svetlana Kuznetsova at Roland Garros and to Venus Williams at Wimbledon.         
	Her top ranking was also questioned by former world number one Jelena Jankovic, who also had similar criticisms levelled at her when she held the mantle as the top-ranked player.                   Serena      
	If I had to pick someone after me, Id pick Serena, Jankovic said last week. To be number one, you should be complete and if you are number one you have to be beating the Williams sisters.         
	Im one of the rare players who have a positive record against the Williams sisters.         
	Safina, who is a combined 2-9 against the Williams sisters while Jankovic is 8-8, said the Serbs perception of what should define the number one ranking was ill conceived. The ranking system is not only based (on) if you beat Serena and Venus, she said. Its based on how you play the whole year.         
	It has nothing to do with what your record is against them.         
	Did she beat them in the final of a Grand Slam? No. It doesnt count when you beat them at a tier four (tournament).           (REUTERS)

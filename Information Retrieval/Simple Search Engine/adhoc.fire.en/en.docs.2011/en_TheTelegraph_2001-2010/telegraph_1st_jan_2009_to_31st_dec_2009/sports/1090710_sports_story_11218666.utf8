The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | New deal on its way: FIA
                                                   New deal on its way: FIA
                      
	Nuerburgring: A new commercial agreement to end the threat of a breakaway Formula One series could be ready within days, the governing body suggested on Thursday.         
	At present it seems probable that a final draft of the 2009 Concorde Agreement will be agreed and ready for signature in the coming days, the International Automobile Federation (FIA) said in a statement headed Setting the Record Straight.         
	The document was published after technical directors of the eight Formula One Teams Association (Fota) members walked out of a meeting with the FIA at the German Grand Prix circuit on Wednesday after being told they could only be observers to proceedings.         
	The FIA had maintained that the five non-Fota teams, including three complete newcomers due to enter next year, were the only ones fully confirmed for 2010 at present because the others had still to sign a new commercial agreement.         
	The walkout triggered fears that a deal agreed between Fota and the FIA in Paris last month could fall apart. A new Concorde Agreement would bind all the teams to Formula One to at least the end of 2012.

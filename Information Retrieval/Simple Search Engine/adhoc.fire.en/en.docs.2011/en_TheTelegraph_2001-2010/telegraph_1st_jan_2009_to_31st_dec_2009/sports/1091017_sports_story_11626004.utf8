The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Easy victory for the Eagles
                                                   Easy victory for the Eagles
                      
	Hyderabad: Decent bowling, complemented by disciplined batting, scripted Diamond Eagles five-wicket victory over Somerset Sabres, who kissed their semi-final hopes good bye after losing the League B encounter in the Champions League here Friday.         
	The Eagles bowlers, especially Cornelius de Villiers (4/17), did a brilliant job  allowing just one significant partnership in the Somerset innings  restricting the English outfit to a modest 132 for eight wickets.         
	The same discipline was the hallmark of their chase as Morne van Wyk (47) and Ryan Bailey (29) guided them near the victory mark and their teammates completed the rest with 1.2 overs to spare. The Eagles got off to an eventful start in their pursuit of victory, with in-form Rilee Rossouw (13) in the thick of things.         
	The attacking left-hander, who had slammed a half-century against Sussex Sharks, was clearly in a hurry. He came down the track to meet the first ball he received, to send it across the rope, while depositing the fourth delivery on the sightscreen for a massive six, to make a statement of intent.         
	Charl Willoughbys torment, however, was soon over as Alfredo Thomas pouched Rossouws skier at mid-on to see the back of the batsman, who was looking ominous.         
	Morne van Wyk and Adrian McLaren (13) maintained the tempo, picking boundaries at will and their stance had yielded 30 quick runs when McLaren fell to Willoughby.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arshavin on course for Arsenal
                                                   Arshavin on course for Arsenal
            OLIVER BROWN                                   
	Dick Advocaat, the Zenit St Petersburg manager, confirmed Monday that Andrei Arshavins 15 million transfer to Arsenal was all but assured.         
	Arshavin has travelled to Dubai on a pre-season tour but Arsenal executives are due in St Petersburg on Tuesday to finalise the details of the deal.         
	The forward held talks before leaving with Advocaat and Alexander Dyukov, the Zenit president, at which he was told that the club were ready to accept an improved offer.         
	The Arsenal board are believed to have tabled an initial 8 million  despite Zenits valuation of 20 million. They have since raised their offer to 15 million. Advocaat admitted: Negotiations with Arsenal continue, and the chances are very high that Arshavin will soon play in the Premier League.         
	Zenits change in attitude has been brought about largely by their acquisition of Portugal striker Danny from Dinamo Moscow, for a Russian record 30 million.         
	The transfer represents a substantial coup for Arsenal in light of the interest already expressed in Arshavin by Manchester City and Inter Milan.         
	Manager Arsene Wenger, who has remained evasive on the subject of Arshavin, has acknowledged progress in Arsenals search. Im very hopeful, in days, yes. We are not close to signing but we know what we want to do.         
	Arshavin was included in Russias Euro 2008 squad by manager Guus Hiddink, despite being unable to play in the first two group matches due to suspension. He announced his return by setting up the first goal and scoring the second in Russias final group game against Sweden which helped his team qualify for the next round.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Koneru Humpy held in third round 
                                                   Koneru Humpy held in third round 
                      
	Istanbul: Grandmaster Koneru Humpy could not breach Betul Cemre Yildizs defence and settled for a draw against the lowest ranked local favourite in the third round of the IS Bank Attaturk Fide Womens Grand Prix chess meet Tuesday.         
	After two victories against much tougher opponents  Swede Pia Cramling and Armenian Elina Danielian Humpy lost her way against Betul.         
	In other matches, Second seed Yifan Hao defeated former world champion Antoaneta Stefanova of Bulgaria in a splendid game where the former played black. After three rounds, Yifan, Martha Baquero Fierro of Ecuador and Zhao Xue of China joined Humpy in lead on 2.5 points out of a possible three.         
	The four leaders are now a full point clear of Antoaneta, Elina and former world champion Maia Chiburdanidze of Georgia. It was a game of fluctuating fortunes between Humpy and Betul. Playing the white side of a Sicilian Rossolimo, Betul stood slightly better after the opening but Humpy neutralised the initiative quite easily with timely strikes on the king side.         
	In the middle game, Betul was content holding on to her level position but Humpys quest for more took the position to wild complexities. Betul, to her credit, did quite well to keep herself in the game.         
	Humpy eventually had an extra pawn in the endgame and she made it better by winning a piece a few moves later. Surprisingly, white still had a defence as Betul proved in the game, which lasted 122 moves.

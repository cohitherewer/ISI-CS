The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Air India snatch a point
                                                   Air India snatch a point
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Air India came from behind to hold Mumbai FC 1-1 in a 17th round I-League encounter at the Cooperage here Saturday.         
	Bimal Ghoshs men looked ragged for the most part of the match and it seemed as if Mumbai FC would prevail with a lone goal, which came in the 38th minute through a Kalia Kulothungan header.         
	But Air India showed why they are considered the most obdurate team in the league as they clawed their way back into the match and found the equaliser through Emmanuel Ovieghara.         
	Oviegharas header was largely due to an error from goalkeeper Amit Singha Roy who, instead of rushing forward to collect, chose to let John Benedict fight with the African for a perfect floater from Michael Tayo. The Indian was no match for Ovieghara and the latter out-muscled Benedict to score his first goal for Air India.         
	Yet, it may also be said that the mistake itself was due to the pressure from Air India after the change of ends.         
	The substitution of an off-colour Surojit Roy by H. Thomte in the 54th minute seemed to enliven the Air India midfield. Gouranga Biswas began to pierce the Mumbai FC left flank more often and Subhas Singh, who was a bit rusty in the first half, rediscovered his menacing form to trouble the opposition defence. On the other hand, Mumbai FC let the match slip from their control after dominating in the first half.

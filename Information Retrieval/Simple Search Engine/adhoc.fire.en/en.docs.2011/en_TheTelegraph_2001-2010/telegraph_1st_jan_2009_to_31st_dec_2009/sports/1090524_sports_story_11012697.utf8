The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Strauss not missing Flintoff, Pietersen
                                                   Strauss not missing Flintoff, Pietersen
                      
	Leeds: England captain Andrew Strauss insists injuries to Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen are not casting a shadow over the sides preparations for the World Twenty20 and the Ashes.         
	All-rounder Flintoff suffered a knee injury playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL), and is doubtful for the hosts World Twenty20 opener against the Netherlands at Lords on June 5. Star batsman Pietersen, who played in both of Englands Tests in their recent 2-0 win over the West Indies, has also been ruled out of the ongoing one-day series against the same opponents with an Achilles injury.         
	Thursdays first one-dayer campaign at Headingley was washed out without a ball being bowled but Flintoff and Pietersens absence could go against England in the second one-dayer in Bristol on Sunday.         
	Its not an ideal situation, but any time you get injuries is not an ideal situation, said Strauss. Its so hard to guess whether Fred (Flintoff) would have been injured anyway, you just dont know. Thankfully, there is still plenty of time before the Ashes and I think we fully expect KP (Pietersen) to be ready in 10 days or so  theres no need to panic just yet injury-wise, its something we can manage.         
	Strauss said: I dont think the fact they are not playing right now is a cause for concern. The guys who came in and played in the two-match series, played well and thats encouraging rather than something to be concerned about.

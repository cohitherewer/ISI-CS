	Mumbai: Sourav Ganguly, who turned 37 Wednesday, kept the speculation about him entering cricket administration alive by speaking of his wish to become an administrator while, at the same time, keeping his fans guessing as to when and where he makes the new beginning.         
	The former India captain, who spent the birthday morning attending his first BCCI Technical Committee meeting at the Cricket Centre, also spoke about the challenges faced by captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Rahul Dravids comeback to the ODI team.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	You have started playing many roles after your international retirement         
	Everything is new; I am getting used to it. But it has not been that long, just six months (since the retirement). Its new and different.         
	What is the objective behind your joining cricket administration?         
	Lets see how it goes in due course. I cant say anything now. I want to be a part of cricket. In Bengal, there are a lot of things that need looking after. Hopefully, I will be part of it. Lets see.         
	On reports about your contesting the CAB elections         
	I have just seen it in the papers. I am not going to comment on it Will take one step at a time and see how it goes.         
	Dhoni has been facing a few challenges as captain         
	Its bound to happen. You cannot go through a long period winning everything. There will be some tough challenges. Dhoni has faced a little bit of it there will be more (in the long run). I dont know how long he captains India, but he is a smart cricketer and has a good head.         
	Your views on Dravids return to the ODI scheme of things         
	He is such a good player he will always be a bonus. Im sure he didnt expect it (the recall). It is good for Indian cricket. He is a top player and will do well for the country. It is a right decision if he does well, which he will.         
	How do you think Irfan Pathans career is progressing?         
	The comeback of Dravid and Ashish Nehra is a prime example of how you can keep coming back if you keep performing. I am sure Irfan himself must be feeling he can do a bit better. We all know that he is exceptionally talented, we shouldnt worry too much.         
	On the idea to have 4-day and day-night Tests         
	I am a supporter of five-day Tests. Regarding day-night Tests, I wont say I am averse to it but the white ball thing must be sorted out to make it interesting.

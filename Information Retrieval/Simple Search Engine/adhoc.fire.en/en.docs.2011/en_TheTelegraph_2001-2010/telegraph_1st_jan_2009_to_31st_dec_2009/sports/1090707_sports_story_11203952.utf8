The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pak in sight of victory in opener
                                                   Pak in sight of victory in opener
                      
	Galle: Left-arm pace bowler Mohammad Amir claimed three wickets in an outstanding post-lunch spell to leave Pakistan chasing just 168 for victory in the opening Test against Sri Lanka on Monday.         
	Pakistan bowled out the hosts for 217 and then finished the third day on 71 for two  just 97 runs shy of their victory target having lost the wickets of Khurram Manzoor (15) and Younis Khan (3).         
	Salman Butt was unbeaten on 28 with Mohammed Yousuf on 12 with the tourists closing in on a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.         
	The 17-year-old Amir followed up on his impressive first innings performance (3-74) by capturing the key wickets of Tharanga Paranavitana (49), Mahela Jayawardene (0) and Kumar Sangakkara (14) as the tourists took control.         
	Amir went wicketless during a rain-shortened morning session but swung the ball both ways in the afternoon to reduce Sri Lanka to 101-5 after they had appeared comfortable on 86-2.         
	The debut-making teenager finished with figures of 3-38 from 11 overs and a match haul of six for 112.         
	In the morning after a delayed start, opener Malinda Warnapura lasted just two balls before edging an Umar Gul delivery to slip.         
	However, Paranavitana steadied the innings in partnership with Rangana Herath, the pair adding 68 for the second wicket

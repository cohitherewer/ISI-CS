The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand ends second 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Anand ends second 
                      
	Moscow: Viswanathan Anand had to be content with the second place in the World Blitz Chess Championship. He managed 28 points, three behind winner Magnus Carlsen of Norway.         
	Anand, who started off brilliantly by winning 12 out of the first 14 games, was three points clear of Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine, who finished third.         
	The Championship saw Anand going in to a two point lead after the first day with Carlsen on his heels but the remaining two days belonged to the Norwegian who scored massively to romp home.         
	Carlsen is likely to become the top rated player in the new-year, when the next Fide rating list will come out. (PTI)

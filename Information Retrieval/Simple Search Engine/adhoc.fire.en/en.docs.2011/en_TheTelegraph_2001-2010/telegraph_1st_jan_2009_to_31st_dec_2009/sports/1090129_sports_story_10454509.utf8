                                                   Country, cricket in a mess: Imran
                      
	Karachi: World Cup-winning captain Imran Khan on Wednesday said that cricket was in as much of a mess as Pakistan and urged the countrys President Asif Ali Zardari to take initiatives to reform the state of the game.         
	If Zardari really wants to help Pakistan cricket then he must allow it to be an institution. It should be constitution-based and have an elected chairman with elected representatives, Imran said.         
	Pakistans cricketing woes saw Shoaib Malik replaced as captain by Younis Khan following the teams humiliating 234-run loss  their worst defeat in ODIs  against visitors Sri Lanka in the deciding match of the series.         
	The change was the third major reshuffle in as many months. In October, Zardari appointed Ijaz Butt chairman of the cricket board, following Nasim Ashrafs resignation. Butt then sacked Australian coach Geoff Lawson for the teams poor performance. Javed Miandad also resigned on Wednesday as director-general of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).         
	Our cricket is as much in the mess as is the country, said Imran.         
	Imran, who led Pakistan to their only World Cup triumph in Australia in 1992, said the countrys head of state appointing the cricket board chairman was the bane of Pakistan cricket.         
	No way should the President of the country appoint the cricket chief, said Imran. The President of Pakistan is patron of the cricket board and appoints its chairman, unlike in countries abroad in which the chairman is elected.         
	Imran said cricket needed to be organised properly in a country obsessed with the game.         
	Why cant Pakistan cricket be based on successful models like Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, where the talent is concentrated in six regional teams set up by nurseries below? said Imran, who played 88 Tests for Pakistan.         
	Miandad has resigned in protest against the limited responsibility given to him. I have taken this decision since I am not satisfied with the terms of the contract given to me, in particular my areas of responsibility which is limited. I have no hard feelings towards anyone but a cricketer of my stature cannot be happy with the responsibilities they are giving me, Miandad said.         
	Miandad, who has coached Pakistan thrice in the past, also admitted he had opposed the immediate removal of Malik as captain.

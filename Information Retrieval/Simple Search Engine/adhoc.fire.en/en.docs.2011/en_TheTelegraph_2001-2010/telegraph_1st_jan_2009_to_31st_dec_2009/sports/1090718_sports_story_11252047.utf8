The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fitness is key, says India bowling coach
                                                     Fitness is key, says India bowling coach
                  Prasad                     
	New Delhi: Team India bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad says cricketers who want to prolong their career, especially reserve players waiting to don India colours, must not compromise on their fitness.         
	When the senior team is touring, what are the other contracted players who are not involved, doing, especially when they are not playing any domestic tournament? Are they working on their fitness? Are they coming to the NCA? I have no idea, Prasad said.         
	When there is a centre of excellence like the NCA, the reserve players should regularly make use of the facilities there, he said.         
	According to Prasad, international players who are struggling to maintain their fitness levels may opt for shorter format of the game like IPL. (PTI)

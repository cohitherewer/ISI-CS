                                                   Sri Lanka close gap on India
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sri Lanka consolidated their position in the fourth place in the Reliance Mobile ICC Test Championship table after a 2-0 home series win over Pakistan that ended on Friday.         
	Kumar Sangakkara amp; Co. gained three ratings points and moved to 111, stretching their lead over fifth-placed England to 10 points.         
	They thus move within just six points of Team India, who are currently placed on the third position of the table.         
	Losing the series, Pakistan slipped further behind England. They were just one-rating point behind England prior to the series but have now slipped to six points adrift in sixth position following the defeat.         
	Where on the table England will finish after the ongoing Ashes series remains to be seen as the ladder is only updated after the conclusion of each series.         
	Meanwhile, Australia still lead the table with South Africa following them in second place.         
	While Fridays championship table may reflect a nine-point lead for Australia over South Africa, that lead will narrow to just two ratings points when the annual update is carried out on August 1.         
	THE RANKINGS         
	Teams  1. Australia; 2. South Africa; 3. India; 4. Sri Lanka; 5. England; 6. Pakistan; 7. West Indies; 8. New Zealand; 9. Bangladesh.

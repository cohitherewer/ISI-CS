The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Rs 70 lakh at stake
                                                                                                               Rs 70 lakh at stake 
            STAR RACER      
	Calcutta: There is lot at stake for horses and for punters, as well, at the RCTC ground on Saturday, the Derby Day. The star event in the afternoons nine-event race card, the 2,400m Eveready Calcutta Derby Stakes, is handsomely rich - offering a total stake of Rs 1.13 crore, with winners take being close Rs to 70 lakh, including the trophy valued at Rs One lakh  an all times record prize for this edition of the classic.           
	The expected magnitude of Derby Day lovers, too, have a rich bonanza in stores for them. A carried forward jackpot amount of over Rs 9.5 lakh will be added to the afternoons pot. The combined pool may not be any comparison with the Derby winners purse but it may certainly outdo the stake of Rs 26 lakh-plus, meant for the second placed horse in the classic.           
	There are 11 horses, including five fillies, in the Derby line-up. Most of the classic horses, who have played second fiddle to the two champion fillies  Set Alight and Icebreaker  in the southern circuit, will be seen in action. The one who has much at stake is Abs Fabs. She is an easy winner of the Mysore Derby. She, however, failed to beat Icebreaker in her subsequent starts  the Bangalore 2,000 Guineas and the Derby.           
	The Derby, in any case, is going to be a very competitive affair. However, fillies are doing well this year and it may not come as a surprise if they down the masculine power, notably Noble View, the likely Derby favourite, and, of course, the local hope, Romantic Tactics, sporting the famed gold-and-red-belt colours. Then there is Abs Fabs whos victory may certainly enhance Icebreakers winning chances in the Indian Derby, on April 12.          
	The added attraction in the days card is the Alokananda Stakes, a platform for younger fillies who may be nurturing classic ambitions, next year. There are eight in the line-up and the race also bears a competitive look.          
	The Telegraph Cup, a 1,200m sprint for horses in the upper classes, has a crowded field of 13 runners. The race may see those drawn in the inner-half of the field having an advantage over the rest. The fancied horses and the hot-footed runners have been, however, drawn on the far side of the track.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Going For Gold may do the trick
                                                                                                               Going For Gold may do the trick
            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Rain Gods have been kind of late, giving hope to the city turfites for a good racing day on Wednesday. The topsy turvy form of favourites in past weeks has been a worrying factor but things are expected to settle down now.          
	Coming to the afternoons seven-event card, the feature event, the 1,800m Rising Bell Cup may see a keen contest among three youngsters  Going For Gold, Spectacular Style and Validate. However, Going For Gold selects herself purely on her superior South India class. The Darius Byramji-trained filly has also done reasonably well during the just concluded Bangalore summer season. With Imran Chisty in the saddle, the Major Impact daughter is, therefore, taken to win.

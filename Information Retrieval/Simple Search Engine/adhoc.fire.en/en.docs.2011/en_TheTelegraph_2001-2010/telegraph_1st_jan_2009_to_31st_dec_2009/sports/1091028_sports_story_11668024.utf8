The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India will make a comeback: Vengsarkar 
                                                     India will make a comeback: Vengsarkar 
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR            Vengsarkar                           
	Nagpur: Dilip Vengsarkar thinks India have a fair chance of making a comeback despite being 0-1 down in the current series.         
	India played good cricket in Vadodara  It wasnt that they were outplayed. It was a close game and could have gone either way. I expect them to make a strong comeback, the former India captain and national selection committee chairman told The Telegraph on Tuesday.         
	Vengsarkar is also not reading too much into Indias failures in the ICC World Twenty20 and the Champions Trophy in South Africa.         
	I dont think much should be made out of these defeats. Its a one-off thing and can happen to any team. Theres no need to press the panic button. Cricket at this level is always a mental game and its only a matter of adjustment. Im sure we will do well, Vengsarkar said.         
	He has full faith in Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who was appointed captain during his tenure as chief selector, and thinks India can turn the tide under him. Hes doing well and has been excelling in pressure situations. Theres no need to worry about his leadership qualities.         
	Vengsarkar, though, had a word of advice for Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Co. The 2011 World Cup is still quite sometime off  Theres enough time in hand and the selectors should look to create more options as backup in every position.         
	Vengsarkar felt the Rahul Dravid issue could have been handled better instead of unceremoniously dropping him from the squad after the Champions Trophy.         
	In hindsight you can say a lot of things The selectors must have had some policy in mind when they picked him Im not sure as to what went on their minds. But Dravid is one of the great players and should have been treated with more respect.         
	He didnt want to make a comment on the sacking of bowling and fielding coaches Venkatesh Prasad and Robin Singh, saying, its the Boards call.         
	Is easy money from the Indian Premier League spoiling the players attitude? Very very difficult to say  Its up to the individual to decide how to keep a balance between the two --- the money and also at the same time not lose focus on the game.         
	Dont forget the players also need money You cant expect them to excel in all matches with so much of cricket going on, he explained.

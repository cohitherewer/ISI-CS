                                                   ICC: Cant go against local law
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The ICC on Tuesday admitted that it cannot go against the local law of a country when it comes to ICL players playing in domestic tournaments.         
	There is a resolution from the ICC members not to promote any unauthorised cricket. But there are situations when the local law takes its course. We cannot go against it, ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said.         
	He was referring to the Sindh high courts decision to lift the domestic ban on Pakistani players who had joined the ICL. I dont want to speculate, he added, when asked if the lifting of the ban would lead to these players staking claim to play for their country in the future.         
	The ICC announced a tie-up with Yahoo as the official internet partner. Rahul Dravid was present on the occasion.

            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            The victorious Indian team with the Azlan Shah Cup in Ipoh on Sunday. (AP)                           
	Calcutta: Olympians hailed Indias victory Sunday at the Azlan Shah tournament saying it was the right step forward for Indian hockey with some major engagements in the offing. Although the field this time for Azlan Shah wasnt that strong in that the top international sides werent involved, hockey veterans said they hoped that the team can build on this victory and revive the interest for the game in the country. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and sports minister M.S. Gill also congratulated the team.               
	The following are excerpts (alphabetically)                 
	Leslie Claudius: Its a tremendous boost for Indian hockey definitely encouraging. This should entice the younger generation to take up hockey. The team played really well, especially the captain (Sandeep Singh).         
	Keshav Dutt: I wish they can keep up the good work. The players are performing well but you have to perform well against the stronger sides, and that too consistently. I dont want to single out anyone for special praiseit was a team effort.         
	Zafar Iqbal: Its (the win) undoubtedly a huge morale booster for the team, but we cant think big about it. The team should now focus on the Asia Cup and next years World Cup.         
	Ashok Kumar: Its a wonderful victory. The win was very important to regain Indian hockeys past glory. Its a confidence booster for the team. Sandeep led from the front. He displayed amazing skills with the stick and also a mature head as captain.         
	Gurbux Singh: Its a good show from the Indians. Beating Malaysia in Malaysia, that too twice (earlier in the round robin stage), is really commendable. Sandeeps performance is really heartening.

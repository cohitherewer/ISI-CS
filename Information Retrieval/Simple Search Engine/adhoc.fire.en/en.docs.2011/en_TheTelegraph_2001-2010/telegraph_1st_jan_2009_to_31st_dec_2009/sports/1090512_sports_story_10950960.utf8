	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) is likely to offer Deep Dasgupta the post of coach-cum-captain of the Bengal side if he severs all ties with the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL).         
	Deep had an hour-long meeting with CAB joint secretary Arun Mitra on Monday. Even though he is yet to decide on his move, if sources are to be believed, the former Bengal captain might be offered the top job. Apart from Deep, Subhomoy Das, Abhishek Jhunjhunwala and Eklakh Ahmed also came to the CAB to meet Mitra.         
	Subhomoy, Abhishek, Shib Sagar Singh and Eklakh have already sought release from the ICL. Deep is expected to follow suit.         
	We (Mitra and the players) had a long chat. Deep has a great cricket brain. It will be great for Bengal if he comes back to the fold. He has served Bengal well in the past and we still need him, Mitra said after the meeting.         
	We had a long discussion on various issues. We discussed the coaching issue. All these players are Bengal crickets assets. Once they get the release from the ICL, theyll be up for selection for the Bengal squad, he added.         
	Deep, too, sounded eager to make a comeback as a Bengal cricketer.         
	I am honoured to be called for a meeting by the CAB. I believe I still have two to three years of cricket left in me. Im fit enough to play any format of the game, he said. We discussed many things. It would be good to play mainstream cricket again. But Im still undecided. I have four days in hand to make up my mind.         
	Asked if he would be happy to coach Bengal, the 31-year old wicketkeeper-batsman said: Look, Im really passionate about coaching. But at this moment, I have to wait and think about my next move.

                                                     You cant teach somebody to bowl quick, says Ian Bishop
  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  Former Windies pacer on, among other things, the complete fast bowler         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ian Bishop                                 
	Johannesburg: Injuries forced an early end to a most promising career, but Ian Bishop made a big impact in the time that he opened the bowling for the West Indies  161 wickets in 43 Tests and 118 from 84 ODIs.         
	Bishop, now 41 and among the most sought-after TV commentators, spoke to The Telegraph on Thursday.               
	The following are excerpts               
	A complete fast bowler         
	Somebody like a Richard Hadlee or a Malcolm Marshall or a Dennis Lillee... Even a Wasim Akram... All could swing the ball, get it to seam and had good control. Indeed, all were very versatile, able to make the most of the conditions on offer.         
	His top five quicks of the present times (alphabetically):         
	James Anderson (Eng): Comes across as an all-round bowler, though conditions have to be right for him... Swings the ball both ways and has good pace... Early in his career, he had problems with control, but that has been sorted out... To become a complete bowler, he needs to do well in all conditions, not only when they suit him.         
	Fidel Edwards (WI): His performances have improved in the past year, but appears to be underrated... Hes among the quickest around and, in this years IPL, showed better control... Dont go by his stats only... Where he does need to get better is the length he bowls... When he swings it away, he often bowls either short or too full... So, thats an area he needs to work on.         
	Umar Gul (Pak): Hes probably been better and more consistent in limited overs cricket, but has the qualities to be a big performer in all forms... He has a good yorker, good reverse-swing... His control, at the moment, is reasonably good... I dont see many weaknesses, but he has to be more consistent and fitter.   
	Mitchell Johnson (Aus): Certainly stands out because of the wickets taken in the past year-and-a-half. Hes still developing as a fast bowler, but is quick throughout his spells and, if he gets it right, then is more than a handful... He needs to work on his wrist position, though... Needs to get it right consistently. That way, then, hes a work under construction.   
	Dale Steyn (SA): Has the pace and a good outswinger... Whats nice is that his control is getting better... Actually, I have a lot of time for him and hes pretty close to becoming an outstanding quick.         
	Avoiding injuries         
	(Grins) Today, there are fewer stress fractures... In the 1990s, there would be stress fractures left, right and centre... Obviously, the bowlers are spending a lot more time in the gym, working on their legs and core muscles... Thats all that one can do, besides getting the action streamlined bio-mechanically.         
	Whether hes disappointed at the way Ishant Sharma is bowling         
	Yes... Hes going through some problem... Hed been good the first time I saw him, at the end of 2007 in India... Hed got better in Australia... Now, however, he looks different... I dont know him personally, but a young body (hes 21) cant take the workload of Tests, ODIs, T20 Internationals, the IPL... Hes playing everything and, over a period of time, the body cant sustain it... Hes falling away just a little bit more... Seems to be losing balance a bit.         
	Impact of T20 on bowlers in general         
	Well, in a way, it encourages bowlers to develop skills... Whats disappointing is that not many are consistently hitting the right areas, the right spots... I dont see enough of the (Glenn) McGrath-type bowling, the (Curtley) Ambrose-type bowling... Thats a worry, not so much the T20 game.         
	Finally, tips for young fast bowlers         
	Bowl as quickly as you can, provided you have the strength... Control will come later, once you understand the game and your body better... You cant teach somebody to bowl quick, he either has it in him or he doesnt. Pace, control and consistency are the elements which matter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its time to make it really big, says Yuvraj Singh 
                                                     Its time to make it really big, says Yuvraj Singh 
    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  Senior pro on entering his 10th year in international cricket             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Yuvraj Singh                                 
	Chandigarh: Former captains Steve Waugh and Ramiz Raja have, in recent times, been effusive in praising Yuvraj Singh. With good reasons, of course.         
	In fact, Yuvrajs return to Team India (after yet another injury-forced lay-off) has straightaway been impact-making, with Mahendra Singh Dhoni emerging the winning captain in the Nagpur and New Delhi ODIs against world champions Australia.         
	Yuvraj, who turns 28 next month, recently spoke to The Telegraph. With time being at a premium for him, the one-on-one had to be somewhat rushed.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Having started his 10th year in international cricket         
	That Ive been playing for the country for so long is an honour...         
	Looking back on the years that have gone by         
	It has been quite a long journey... You could say Im in the middle period of my career and the idea, most definitely, is to get better... For much of this period, Ive batted down the order... Now, Im getting the chance to bat higher... Today, my batting is looking better and, indeed, its time to make it really big.         
	Areas for improvement         
	Right now, there are more ODIs than Tests... So, its important to produce match-winning performances in the 50-over game... The country expects that from me... Talking of Tests, I accept that I need to be more consistent in that form. Hopefully, the more I play, the better Ill become... Experience, as they say, is invaluable.         
	Whether the limited-overs-cricketer-only label is off his neck now         
	Yes, dont think its there... I had a pretty decent run in Tests last season... Unfortunately, we havent played a Test since early April (in New Zealand)... I have fond memories of the unbroken 163-run partnership with Sachin (Tendulkar) in the Chennai Test against England, last December...Batting at No.6, I contributed 85 and will look back on that innings with plenty of satisfaction... That partnership helped India win.         
	The point about too few Tests         
	Look, the way cricket is moving, there will be more T20... I wouldnt say T20 is entertainment only... Theres a fair bit of cricket involved and skills do come into play... Test cricket, though, is the real cricket... I believe that the more Tests you play, the better you become as a cricketer.         
	Whether T20 will take the 50-over ODIs off the calendar         
	Its easier to sit for three hours and watch a T20 match, rather than spending seven watching a 50-over contest... The ODIs will take a hit, but that form of cricket remains important.         
	Challenge No.1 for Team India         
	To become No.1 in both Tests and ODIs and, then, to stay there... Our goals for this season are clear and the team is working towards the No.1 position in those two forms.         
	The challenge for him         
	To raise the bar and challenge myself in all forms...         
	Insisting that hes not indispensable in limited overs cricket, but only gives the team balance         
	Absolutely. Thats the way I see it.         
	Having been the Team India vice-captain during the World T20, the ODI series in the West Indies and the recent tri-series in Sri Lanka         
	The captain and the coach have a much bigger role to play... Contributing to the team is important, not whether one is the vice-captain or not. Its not about positions         
	Graduating from a rookie to a senior pro         
	Its like a family in the dressing room... I try and pass on, to the youngsters, things that Ive learnt.         
	Injuries forcing him to start from scratch, almost         
	Its something that has to be accepted by sportspersons... Like it or not, its a part and parcel of the career of sportsmen like me.         
	The pressure on Team India as the 2011 World Cup draws near         
	Its bound to grow... At the same time, we ourselves are determined to become the biggest force in world cricket by the time the World Cup begins... The grooming of youngsters, between now and then, is going to be critical.         
	Sachin indicating that hell be around till 2011, at least         
	That would be his last World Cup and who wouldnt be delighted to have him around? Having said that, dont forget he has already put in 20 years and its hard on his body         
	The Yuvraj Singh Foundation, launched in South Africa during this years IPL         
	Some things are planned, but time is a factor... Any event has to take my availability into account.         
	Finally... Being linked to different women in different seasons         
	(Laughs) Two months ago, Id been linked to eight women at the same time... Often, its news even to me! I have a good laugh... Im not unhappy at being treated as the pin-up boy of Indian cricket... Let me assure you Im happy being single!

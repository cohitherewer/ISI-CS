The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Akhtar ruled out of World T20
                                                   Akhtar ruled out of World T20
            THE TIMES, LONDON                       
	Shoaib Akhtar has been withdrawn from Pakistans squad for the World Twenty20 in England next month, with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) being surprisingly candid in revealing that the fast bowler had received treatment for genital warts.         
	The 33-year-old had missed Pakistans conditioning camp last week as well as the first of three practice matches on Wednesday.         
	We have pulled him out of the World Twenty20 on the basis of a medical report given by our doctor which said that Akhtar needs ten days to recover from groin wounds, the PCB said. The medical board has reported that Akhtar was suffering from genital viral warts.         
	Akhtar has undergone electrofulguration, a surgical procedure that involves passing an electrical current through the affected area.

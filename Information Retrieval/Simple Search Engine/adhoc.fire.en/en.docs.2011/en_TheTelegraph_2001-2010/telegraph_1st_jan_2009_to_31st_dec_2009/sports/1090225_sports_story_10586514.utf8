The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Players still hopeful
                                                   Players still hopeful
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The city-based players, who joined the Indian Cricket League (ICL), remain positive and hopeful despite the failure of talks with the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in Johannesburg on Monday.         
	Deep Dasgupta is hoping something positive will emerge in the coming months. A little bit disappointed yes But happy that theyre talking now. Having a dialogue is always welcome. The ICC will discuss the issue again in April. Hopefully said the former Bengal captain.         
	Avishek Jhunjhunwala, though, couldnt hide his disappointment. We were hopeful that some sort of solution would come through at the meeting.         
	But nothing was decided and we still remain in the dark. The fact that the ICC has taken a positive approach towards solving the impasse gives us a lot of hope.         
	We are still not losing hope and will eagerly await the outcome of the ICCs meeting in April in Dubai, said the right-hand batsman.         
	The BCCIs stance is very disappointing. Our job is to play and we should be granted that chance, no matter wherever we play. The ban on the cricketers should be lifted and the BCCI should recognise the ICL. What is the difference between ICL and IPL? We will decide during ICLs domestic tournament in March, and see if we can put forward our side of the case to the BCCI.         
	Subhomoy Das echoed similar views. It is a serious matter. The problem has been lingering on for about two years now and we want a solution. I, too, want to play in Ranji Trophy and other domestic tournaments.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Players bodies want one rule 
                                                   Players bodies want one rule 
                            
	New Delhi: The players associations of South Africa and New Zealand share the Indian cricketers privacy and security concerns regarding the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada)s whereabouts clause but insist that rules are same for all and no special exemptions can be made for them.         
	We think that the Indian players have genuine security concerns regarding whereabouts filings under the code and the International Cricket Council (ICC) needs to deal with these. However all other players, including South African players, are currently complying with the whereabouts provisions, South African Cricketers Association (SACA) CEO Tony Irish said.         
	If the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) continues to reject the whereabouts provisions then we would expect ICC not to enforce these against players from other countries, he added.         
	Irishs views were backed by New Zealand Players Association CEO Heath Mills, who said even the Black Caps had reservations about the whereabouts clause, which requires cricketers to disclose their location three months in advance for out-of-competition dope tests.         
	We dont particularly like the whereabouts regulation either but we are obligated to follow it and all Wada rules since the ICC adopted the Wada code a few years ago. The Wada code is now part of all ICC and member boards rules and regulations which the players must follow, Mills said.         
	The situation with the Indian cricketers is interesting. We support the concerns they have about the new regulation. However, we also shouldnt have some players in the sport of cricket operating under different rules to others, as that isnt fair. The ICC should have everyone operating under the same rules, Mills added.         
	On whether the BCCIs refusal to accept the code would lead to a showdown between the Indian Board and the ICC, Irish said the bigger fallout would be the setback to the anti-doping campaign in cricket.         
	The fallout of this confrontation is obviously that the whereabouts provisions, and the ability to properly test out of competition will be negated, not only in India but in other countries. This may seriously hamper ICCs anti-doping efforts. Cricket needs to have credible anti-doping regulations.         
	The players international body, FICA (of which SACA is a member), has already told ICC that if Indian players are allowed not to comply then other players should be treated in the same way, he added.         
	Mills said all the players associations would be meeting in September to discuss the contentious clause.         
	There is a meeting of a number of World Player Associations in London in early September which FICA (Tim May) will be attending. Wada will also attend the meeting and will be discussing the whereabouts requirements for those who participate in team sports. Through Tim May we will be tabling our concerns at this meeting, he said.         
	It would be good if the Indians had a players association like in other countries and all other sports as the players could raise issues about this sort of thing more easily and at least have a representative group to act on their behalf, he added.         
	Irish, meanwhile, said the South African players would continue to comply with the code.           (PTI)

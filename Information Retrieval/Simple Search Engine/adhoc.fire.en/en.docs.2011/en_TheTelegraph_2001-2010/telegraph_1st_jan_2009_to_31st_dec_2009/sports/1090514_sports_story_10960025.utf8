The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Renault latest to threaten pull out
                                                   Renault latest to threaten pull out
            Edward Gorman                      
	The storm clouds are continuing to gather over Formula One as Renault followed Ferraris lead on Wednesday in declaring that they, too, will not enter next years World Championship unless the FIA changes its proposals on budget capping.         
	In what appeared to be a choreographed move before a key meeting between the Formula One teams, Max Mosley, the president of the FIA, and Bernie Ecclestone, the sports commercial rights-holder, at Heathrow on Friday, Renault said that they could not accept a two-tier championship. The French manufacturer joined Ferrari in criticising the way that Mosley has imposed new rules on the teams without what they view as proper consultation.         
	Our aim is to reduce costs while maintaining the high standards that make Formula One one of the most prestigious brands on the market, Renault said. We want to achieve this in a co-ordinated manner with the regulatory and commercial bodies, and we refuse to accept unilateral governance handed out by the FIA.         
	The move follows the Ferrari boards threat to leave Formula One at the end of this season unless Mosley abandons his plans for a two-tiered championship, with cars running under a  40million budget cap being allowed greater technical freedom than those funded by unlimited budgets. The intervention by Renault brings to five the number of teams who have said they may not enter next seasons championship, the others being Red Bull, Toro Rosso, and Toyota.         
	At Ferrari, Luca Di Montezemolo added coals to the fire by publicly thanking the teams fans for their support for a decision that could end 60 years of unbroken participation in Formula One. The Ferrari president said that his cars would find other formulas in which to compete, should the FIA not accede to his wishes. Ferrari sources mentioned the Indy Racing League series in the United States and Le Mans in Europe as candidates.         
	If it was really like that, then I have to say that our cars will race in other competitions, where they will find the enthusiasm and passion of millions of fans following us in every corner of the world, Di Montezemolo said.         
	In the face of growing opposition to its proposals and its style of governing, the FIA remained impervious to the criticism, an official saying: Our position hasnt changed. The reasons for what we are doing are well documented. He referred to recent comments by Tony Purnell, the FIA technical adviser, who believes that a deal will soon be reached with the teams and that the sound and fury from them is little more than hysteria.         
	Whenever change has been required, the teams have cried Armageddon, said Purnell, citing the introduction of Parc Ferme regulations, the switch from V10 engines to V8s and the introduction of the Kinetic Energy Recovery System. On each occasion, there were those who claimed that Formula One would fall apart.         
	The strange element about this crisis is that the teams keep issuing statements objecting to proposals that already look unlikely ever to be implemented. The most obvious case in point is the two-tiered championship, which Ecclestone has said does not look as if it will ever come into being.           THE TIMES, LONDON

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahesh, Sania reach final
                                                     Mahesh, Sania reach final
                  Sania Mirza and Mahesh Bhupathi celebrate their win on Friday                     
	Melbourne: Sania Mirza and Mahesh Bhupathi stand just one win away from their maiden mixed doubles Grand Slam title together after beating Iveta Benesova and Lukas Dlouhy of the Czech Republic 6-4, 6-1 in the Australian Open semi-finals here Friday.         
	Among the juniors, top-seed Yuki Bhambri continued his spectacular run to reach the boys singles finals with a 6-4, 6-4 triumph over French seventh seed Adrien Puget.         
	However, Yukis doubles campaign ended after he and his Taipei partner Liang chi-Huang, seeded No.1, lost 3-6, 1-6 to Mikhal Biryukov (Russia) and Yasutaka Uchiyama (Japan) in the semi-finals played just hours after the Indians singles match.         
	Sania and Bhupathi, who were runner-up at the Melbourne Park last year, trailed 1-3 in the opening set before storming back to seal the issue in 54 minutes.         
	In the summit clash, they will take on the unseeded French-Israeli combine of Nathalie Dechy and Andy Ram, who stunned seventh seeded Spaniards Anabel Medina Garrigues and Tommy Robredo 7-6(9-7), 6-4.         
	It was hardly the kind of start Sania and Bhupathi, who have dropped just one set en route to the semis, would have wanted as Benesova and Dlouhy broke them in the opening game to race to a 1-3 lead. However, the Indians got their act together and broke back twice to take the first set in 32 minutes.         
	Sania and Bhupathi continued their dominance in the second set and broke their rivals thrice.         
	Such was their hold over the proceedings that the Indians did not face a single break point in the second set, which they wrapped up in a mere 22 minutes.         
	The win makes it a double delight for Bhupathi, who along with Bahamian Mark Knowles, has also made the mens doubles finals. (PTI)

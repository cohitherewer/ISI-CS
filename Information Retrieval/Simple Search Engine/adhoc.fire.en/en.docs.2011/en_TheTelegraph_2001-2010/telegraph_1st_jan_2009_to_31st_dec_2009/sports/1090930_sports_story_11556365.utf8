	Manchester: Buoyed by seven straight victories in all competitions, Manchester United can topple Champions League Group B leaders Wolfsburg by beating the German champions at Old Trafford on Wednesday.         
	United manager Alex Ferguson has been impressed by the debutants in Europes premier club competition and their strikers Grafite and Edin Dzeko, who combined for 54 goals last season to help Wolfsburg to their first Bundesliga title.         
	It says a lot for Wolfsburgs ambition and progress that they did win the league last year and they did it in a very positive way, Ferguson said Tuesday.         
	The most amazing thing about our opponents is that you look at the history of German football for the last umpteen years, its unusual for a team with Wolfsburgs background to win the Bundesliga and the number of goals they scored was amazing.         
	Ferguson gave a guarded response when asked if he looked at Dzeko, a 23-year-old Bosnia-Herzegovina international, over the off-season as a possible replacement for the departed Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez.         
	We saw (Dzeko) and we very impressed with him, Ferguson said. Theyve got big lads, powerful, and Grafite is a good player, gets in good positions and gets players in behind him.         
	The 30-year-old Grafite scored a hattrick in Wolfsburgs Champions League debut two weeks ago to clinch a 3-1 victory over CSKA Moscow. United, the defending Premier League champions and current leaders, relied on 34-year-old midfielder Paul Scholess late goal to win 1-0 at Besiktas.         
	Ferguson believes obtaining six points from the four-team group will clinch qualification to the knockout stage.         
	Wolfsburg probably are the main dangers to qualifying, Ferguson said. It may turn into a very open game. You just have to be careful not to get too cocky, you still have to win your games.         
	The Red Devils boast an unbeaten home streak in the competition dating back to February 2005. Ferguson believes that will continue if they can exploit Wolfsburgs defensive frailties.         
	Those concerns are shared by Wolfsburg coach Armin Veh, especially with captain Josue an injury doubt. The Brazilian midfielder plays an important role in collecting loose balls and intercepting attacks, but is still in pain after returning from knee surgery.         
	Chelsea lead Group D but lost their perfect start to the Premier League season on Saturday when they surprisingly lost 1-3 at Wigan. Now they go to APOEL Nicosia, who did well to capture a draw with Atletico Madrid two weeks ago. The Spanish club hope to rebound with a victory at Portuguese champions FC Porto.         
	Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole could return to Champions League action against APOEL Nicosia Wednesday.         
	The England forward, who, aside from a League Cup appearance against Queens Park Rangers, has not played for the Stamford Bridge club since January, flew out with the rest of the Chelsea first-team squad to Cyprus on Tuesday.         
	Ancelotti will decide on Tuesday evening whether this is the right time to allow 27 year-old Cole back on to the big stage following his return from an eight-month injury lay-off and cruciate ligament surgery in the League Cup last week.         
	Real Madrid, who take on Olympique Marseille in their Group C match Wednesday, will be without injured midfielder Lassana Diarra.         
	The France international has a shoulder complaint, joining striker Ruud van Nistelrooy and defenders Alvaro Arbeloa and Christoph Metzelder on the injury list. (AP)

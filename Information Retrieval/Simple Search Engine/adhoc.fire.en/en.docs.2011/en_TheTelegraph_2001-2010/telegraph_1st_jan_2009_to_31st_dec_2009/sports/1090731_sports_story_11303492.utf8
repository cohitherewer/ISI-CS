                                                     Not enough food for rugby players
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Indian rugby team players make merry before leaving for their South African tour, in Mumbai, on Thursday. (PTI)                           
	Mumbai: The Indian rugby team, preparing for the 2010 Commonwealth Games, do not have enough food to eat.         
	On the eve of the 24-member squads departure to South Africa on Thursday, where they will train and play at the Stellenbosch University, coach Norman Laker explained the issue.         
	We dont get enough food and supplements. I started to work with the team three months ago and its been two months since we informed the authorities about our requirements. But nothing has changed, South African Laker said.         
	The players have three meals a day and thats not enough. In South Africa, elite rugby players have seven meals a day. I have told them (his players) they must eat at least 15 eggs a day, six for breakfast and the remaining nine any time, any how, during the day.         
	As Laker detailed the daily diet of an international rugby player, its disparity with the Indians diet became clear.         
	It starts with breakfast at 7am, snack at 10, lunch at 1pm, again snack at three, another snack at five or six clock, dinner at 8.30pm and another snack before you go to bed, Laker said.         
	What Laker means by snack comprises, in South Africa, a vegetable sandwich, apple or banana or both, and whatever one can add to it. Breakfast and a meal will include large chunks of chicken, fish and meat.         
	Indian players weigh 72-77 kg on an average whereas the international players weigh between 88 and 100 kg. That is the weight difference you have to make up, the coach said.         
	The problem for the India players, who had been training for the last three months at Balewadi near Pune, has been compounded by the Sports Authority of India (SAI) bureaucracy.         
	SAI, which handles the funds sanctioned by the government and monitors the training programme for all sports for the 2010 CWG, has fixed a food allowance of Rs. 550 per day for athletes taking part in power sports like rugby and wrestling. While the amount may sound frugal, it decreases as one moves across to disciplines like shooting. Moreover, SAI has contracted a single caterer for all sportspersons training in Balewadi, which means the same menu for athletes of all disciplines, irrespective of the varying needs of the players.         
	The players should at least have four meals and three diet supplements. The supplements should contain all the protein and should make up for the lack of snack, Laker said.         
	Hopefully, SAI and the sports ministry are listening!

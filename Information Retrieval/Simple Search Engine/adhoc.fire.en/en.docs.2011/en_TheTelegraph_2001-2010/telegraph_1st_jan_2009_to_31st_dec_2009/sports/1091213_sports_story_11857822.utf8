                                                                                                                       7                                      Birthday boy Yuvraj has a blast on his home turf
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mohali: Saturday was Yuvraj Singhs 28th birthday and he couldnt have gifted himself a better present than an India victory on his home turf in Mohali.         
	The target of 207 set by the Sri Lankans looked a challenging one once Virender Sehwags (64, 36 balls, 7x4, 3x6) swashbuckling innings was halted. But Yuvraj (60, 25 balls, 3x4, 5x6) attacked the bowlers with such gusto that the stiff target looked easy.         
	When his partnership of 80 in six overs with skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (46, 28balls, 3x4, 2x6) came to an end, victory was just a formality.         
	It was Yuvrajs fifth T20 half century and, definitely, an emotional one considering it was a special day for him. He completed his half-century off only 20 deliveries. It was fitting enough when his fifth six, off Angelo Mathews, finished off the match.         
	And the icing on the cake would definitely be the three Lankan wickets he scalped earlier in the evening.         
	India reached the target with five balls to spare and it was the highest successful chase in T20 Internationals which enabled them to level the two-match series at 1-1.         
	Although the Indians, courtesy Sehwag and Dhoni, kept the asking rate within control, it was the 16th over of the innings that tilted the scales completely in Indias favour.         
	Yuvraj suddenly launched into Nuwan Kulasekera and hit him for two fours and two huge sixes over long-on. From 159 for two in 15 overs, Indias total went up to 182 at the end of the 16th over.         
	After that, it was just a mere formality. But the hosts lost two more wickets as Dhoni was cleaned up by a Dilhara Fernando yorker and Suresh Raina (9) was needlessly run-out.         
	If Yuvraj deserves the credit for magnificently finishing the job, Virender Sehwag started it all as he hit Lankas new ball bowlers Kulasekera and Kaushalya Weeraratne all over the park.         
	However, he was lucky when Sanath Jayasuriya dropped a simple catch at mid-on after he had hit Weeraratne for a six in the previous delivery.         
	The Lankans were also guilty of not being able to effect couple of simple run-outs of Gautam Gambhir (21 off 18 balls, 1x4). Although Gambhir was not hitting the ball well, Sehwag made up for it with some clean hitting over long on and the extra cover region.         
	The most surprising decision by the Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara was not giving a single over to Jayasuriya who bowled brilliantly, the other night in Nagpur.         
	His faith on his pacers backfired completely as his new ball bowlers Weeraratne and Kulasekera gave away a whopping 93 runs in seven overs combined. Add to that Angelo Mathewss figures as he gave away 49 runs in 3.1overs. That makes it 142 runs in 10.1 overs.         
	Earlier, the Indian fielders had another forgettable day in the office as they let Sri Lanka off the hook dropping as many as six catches. This enabled the visitors to score 206 for seven.         
	At the start of the innings, Ishant Sharma bowled with a lot of fire. He worked up a fair bit of pace and his very second delivery saw Tillekaratne Dilshans leg stump being uprooted. Ishant pitched it on a fuller length and the extra yard of pace undid the Lankan opener.         
	Kumar Sangakkara seemed like starting from where he had left the other night in Nagpur. He started with a boundary off Ishant.         
	At the end of the first five overs, Sri Lanka were 61 for one with the Jayasuriya-Sangakkara duo completing the half-century partnership in a flash.         
	Yusuf Pathan finally got the breakthrough when his straighter one hit Jayasuriya on the full as the veteran batsman went for a sweep.         
	The Lankan skipper continued attacking the Indian spinners as the teams 100 came in only 9.2 overs.         
	Sangakkara who is a local boy (Mohali being the home ground for the Kings XI Punjab) completed his second half-century in as many matches when he hoisted Yuvraj over mid-wicket for a six.         
	Yuvraj had the last laugh though as the Lankan captain perished trying to repeat the shot. As a result, it was a simple catch to Nehra at long-on. Sangakkaras 31-ball 59 was studded with eight boundaries and two huge sixes.

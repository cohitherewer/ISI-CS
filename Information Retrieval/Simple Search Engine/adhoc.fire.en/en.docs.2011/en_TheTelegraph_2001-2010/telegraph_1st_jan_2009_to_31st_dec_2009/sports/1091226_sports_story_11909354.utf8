The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ricky Ponting hopes to pass fitness test
                                                                                                                       7                                        Ricky Ponting hopes to pass fitness test
                  Ricky Ponting                     
	Melbourne: Feeling better after Fridays practice session, Ricky Ponting is confident of leading Australia in the Boxing Day Test against Pakistan.         
	Ponting batted without guard on the injured elbow, facing teammates Peter Siddle and Doug Bollinger with the new ball. If he passes the fitness test, he will be available.         
	I went well today actually... I went better than yesterday. I had a bit of pain in the nets yesterday. I was always going to bat two days into the game. Im really confident that I can play the game, Ponting said.         
	However, New South Wales Phillip Hughes will stay with the team as standby until the match starts Saturday. Ponting had suffered the elbow injury in the third Test against the West Indies in Perth, when he was struck by a delivery from Kemar Roach, which caused tendon damage.         
	According to Cricinfo, Ponting will play only if he feels he is hundred per cent fit. Im not going to be playing until I feel I can play to my capabilities, its as simple as that, the Australia captain was quoted as saying.         
	At some stage I will probably have some discomfort but it is nothing to stop me functioning. That is the thing I have been gauging over the last couple of days: is the pain too much to stop me functioning in the right way and it certainly hasnt been that. Im surprised at how well I woke up this morning, how much better I feel today.         
	The reason I retired hurt in Perth  I couldve kept batting, stood around with one arm  but where the game was at that stage I felt other guys had a better chance of taking the game forward than I did at that time. It is a huge responsibility on players to be honest when they are going into a game.         
	In five-day games it is easy to get caught out and with one player going down it is the difference between winning and losing a match, and therefore winning and losing a series. Ive said all through the week that I wont be silly with it and do everything in my power to give myself best chance to play. Thats what Ive done, worked tirelessly to get my elbow right and it feels really good at the moment.         
	If he does play, he is likely to do so with an arm guard, a piece of protection he has avoided through his career and one which he admits will involve swallowing a little pride.         
	I wore it at training and got 30-40 text messages from mates whod seen me wearing it. I swallowed the pride and put it on again today  one thing that is going to rule me out is another hit, said Ponting.         
	I wanted to face Siddle and Bollinger with the new ball this morning, I wanted them to have a bit of a crack as well just to test me out as much as possible so I thought I would put it on this morning. If I happen to wear it tomorrow I might put on a long sleeve shirt to cover it over.         
	In addition to inflicting that injury, Roach dismissed Ponting three times out of five in the recent series, leading his captain Chris Gayle to claim that the Australian captain had a glaring weakness against the short ball.         
	In Umar Gul and Mohammed Aamer, Pakistan has two bowlers quick enough to test the claim, even if Ponting is widely considered to be one of the best pullers in the modern game.         
	Ive been hit on the arm once in my career so if I have a weakness against the short ball, Ill find out over the next few weeks because the Pakistanis have got some good fast bowlers. Im more than happy for them to bowl short at me all day. (Agencies)

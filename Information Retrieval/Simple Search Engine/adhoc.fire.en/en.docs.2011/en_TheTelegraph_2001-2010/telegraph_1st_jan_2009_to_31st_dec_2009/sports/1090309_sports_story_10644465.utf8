The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Randhawa best, SSP tied fourth
                                                   Randhawa best, SSP tied fourth
                      
	Phuket: Jyoti Randhawa blasted a flawless five-under 65 in the final round to cruise to a comfortable two-stroke victory over Rhys Davies of Wales at the Thailand Open here Sunday. The 36-year-old Randhawa sank as many as five birdies to take his tally to 17-under 263 and pip Davies, who hit three-under 67 at the Laguna Phuket Golf Club Sunday.         
	Chinese Taipeis Lu Wei-chih fired a five-under 65 to settle for third position, one stroke ahead of S.S.P. Chowrasia (69) at tied fourth along with Chinese Wu Ashun (66).         
	Randhawa was off to a brilliant start with a birdie on the first hole before hitting a birdie-brace on the fourth and fifth to take the turn at three-under.         
	His backward journey was equally magical as he picked up two more birdies on the 12th and 15th to clinch the title. Randhawas effort has him richer by $79,250.         
	Im feeling great. I played marvellous golf the last two days. To shoot five-under without any bogeys was good, Im very happy, said Randhawa. (PTI)

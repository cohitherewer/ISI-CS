The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuki deserves Davis Cup berth: Vijay
                                                   Yuki deserves Davis Cup berth: Vijay
                      
	Chennai: Former Davis Cup captain Vijay Amritraj feels there is no reason why Indias first Australian Open boys singles champion Yuki Bhambri, should not be straightaway granted his wish to play for the country.         
	Amritraj said that playing with seniors would help the new kid on the block to perform on the mens circuit.         
	Definitely, he said when asked if Yuki could be fielded in Indias Davis Cup team. He is the guy who has won a Grand Slam title for us after so many years. It is a big achievement. We need singles players. I find him a very good alternative and he obviously has the abilities to get better, Amritraj explained.         
	Yuki, who returned home from Down Under Monday, said his next target was to play for India in the Davis Cup.         
	Easily, by far, Yuki is the best youngster we have now. So there is no question of not bringing Yuki into the fold.         
	Playing other 16-year-olds in the Australian Open or Wimbledon is an entirely different cup of tea from playing against Jim Simon in a Davis cup tie, he added.         
	Amritraj said he was looking forward to greater success for Yuki at the higher level.         
	We are off to a terrific start in 2009. We have always had strong potential. We always had a fairly good set of juniors. But we have not been able to translate that into bigger results like the Europeans.         
	That is what I am looking forward to. For example, in Yukis case, he is doing the right thing. Living in Florida and training at the Nick Bollettieri Academy and working hard with the coaches there. The only thing that he needed to do was to get physically stronger, which he did.         
	He has got the height and good legs. I must say that he has an extremely bright future from the physical point of view, Amritraj added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brett Lee is ready for return
                                                   Brett Lee is ready for return
                      
	Leeds: Australia speedster Brett Lee insisted on Wednesday that he was ready to make a return from injury in the fourth Test as Australia look to revive their Ashes campaign.         
	Lee, the most experienced bowler in Australias attack with 310 wickets from 76 Tests, has not featured at all in the first three matches of this Ashes series after sustaining a side injury in the lead-up to the first Test.         
	But the 32-year-old New South Wales quick was adamant he would be fit to last the pace in the fourth Test, which starts at Headingley here on Friday with Australia 0-1 down in the five-match series.         
	Asked if he was fit for Test cricket, Lee told reporters: Yes, 100 per cent. I do believe I have done the work.         
	Most days Ive bowled back-to-back, morning and afternoon sessions. Today I bowled practically the whole session and my pace felt really good. Im 100 per cent ready to go.         
	The bowler didnt see a problem with his lack of match practice. Hopefully Ive done everything I can to prove Im ready to go.         
	Hopefully Ive passed that, bowling eight days straight and can prove that I can stand up. (AFP)

    - Dhonis Team equals record of eight victories on the trot             A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Yuvraj Singh leaps after completing his century as Virender Sehwag looks on in Colombo on Tuesday. (AP                                 
	Calcutta/Colombo: Sensational centuries from Yuvraj Singh and Virender Sehwag helped India pocket the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka, with two matches remaining, on Tuesday.         
	Yuvraj, who seems to be in the form of his life, hit a swashbuckling 117 off 95 balls. Sehwag was not to be left behind as he smashed 116 off 90 balls. The pair set the Premadasa on fire with their scintillating strokeplay, and in the process added 221 runs for the third wicket.         
	Yuvraj and Sehwag took the match away from us, Mahela Jayawardene admitted after the 147-run loss.         
	This was after the Indians were reduced to 24 for two with Sachin Tendulkar being the victim of yet another dubious decision from the umpire. Man of the Match Yuvraj took most of the strike, hitting some magnificent boundaries on either side of the wicket.         
	Sehwag was a spectator in the early part of the partnership, but when the opportunity presented itself, he was no less ruthless.         
	There was a big-hitting cameo from Yusuf Pathan towards the end of the Indian innings and four wickets for the promising Pragyan Ojha, but all that came to nought when compared to Yuvraj and Sehwags innings.         
	Muttiah Muralidharan equalled Wasim Akrams world record of 502 one-day wickets and Kumar Sangakkaras classy 83 proved to be little more than a footnote on a day when Sri Lanka were again way off the pace.         
	The victory also equalled Indias record of eight ODI wins on the trot. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, however, insisted fielding reserve players  so that they, too, get a chance to prove their mettle  was more important than retaining the winning squad in pursuit of their record ninth straight win.         
	The following are excerpts on what the captains and Yuvraj had to say:         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni: The teams doing well, and thats what is important. Yuvraj and Virender played very well today. They put pressure on them (Sri Lanka) to bowl in the bad areas, and then went after them. We did not want Yuvraj or Virender to get bogged down under pressure. We wanted them to play their natural game. Weve been playing well and as a team we want to enjoy our cricket, we want to enjoy each others success We are not really going for any record Rarely is a series wrapped up in the first three games. But now that weve won it, we will give a chance to the other players in the two remaining matches.         
	Mahela Jayawardene: We took two early wickets but Yuvraj and Virender batted well. It was a brilliant partnership. We had a fair chance but they took the game away from us. We have no complaints, but there are a few areas of concern. There are certain areas we need to tighten up. We have to win matches to gain confidence. We need to give our tired players a rest, we have a lot of cricket coming up.         
	Yuvraj Singh: First of all, I would like to share my Man of the Match award with Sehwag he took the pressure off me. We decided to bat normally. We got a lot of loose balls and luckily we put all the loose balls away to the boundary. We enjoyed each others shots and ran well between the wickets. It is a big achievement for me to score a century with Sehwag. It is normally he who races away. He generally gets there within a blink.

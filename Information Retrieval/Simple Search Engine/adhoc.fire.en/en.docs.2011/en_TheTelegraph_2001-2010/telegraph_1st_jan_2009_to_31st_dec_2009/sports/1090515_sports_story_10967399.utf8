The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhutia asked to show cause
                                                     Bhutia asked to show cause
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bhaichung                           
	New Delhi: Mohun Bagan on Thursday show caused their captain Bhaichung Bhutia for allegedly neglecting his club duties throughout the season and not accompanying the team for an exhibition tie at Jalpaiguri.         
	In a strongly-worded letter, the club secretary, Anjan Mitra has asked the national captain to clarify his conduct within 48 hours and has advised him not to join the team practice till that time.         
	Mitra, who is believed to be upset with Bhaichung for ignoring his directive to accompany the team to north Bengal, has accused the star striker for taking things lightly for a long time.         
	In the letter, Mitra has pointed out that Bhaichung chose not to travel with the team on the eve of some of the most important matches like the crucial I-League match against Mahindra United in Delhi and the AFC Cup tie in Jordan.         
	On both occasions, the club secretary pointed out, Bhaichung joined the practice sessions later.         
	Your performance during the later stages of the ONGC I-League and the Super Cup was not up to the desired standard, the letter said. This is one of the main reasons that Mohun Bagan could not win the league.         
	Accusing Bhaichung of taking things lightly, the letter even regretted that the star player forgot his role as the icon of Indian football and could not play the vital part that was expected of him. According to the club, the footballer not only failed to conduct himself on and off the field but also behaved in the most casual manner.         
	It is evident that this season your focus has shifted from football and it has now become your secondary interest. It is totally unexpected from a senior professional footballer, the latter said.         
	While Bhaichung was unavailable for comment, Mohun Bagan club sources said the officials were long been unhappy with the striker.         
	Their patience finally ran out when the footballer did not travel with the team to Jalpaiguri despite being informed well in advance.         
	The club officials felt that Bhaichung remained too occupied with other activities like television shows and was not at all committed to the cause of the club.         
	It may be recalled that in a similar incident in the 70s, the then East Bengal management show caused some of their key players like Tarun Bose, Sudhir Karmakar, Ashoklal Banerjee and Gautam Sarkar for not playing an exhibition match for the club.         
	All the four players, who were instrumental behind East Bengal winning the Calcutta league six times in a row, left the club in a huff the following season. The red and yellow brigade failed to regain the league title.

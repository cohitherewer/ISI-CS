The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dempo SC on guard
                                                   Dempo SC on guard
                                  
	New Delhi: Dempo SC have to guard against complacency when they take on Al Muharraq in the AFC Cup Group E away match in Manama, Bahrain, Tuesday. Dempo are currently on top of the table with six points from two matches while defending champions Muharraq are yet to open their account.         
	However, coach Armando Colaco has warned his boys against complacency.         
	I have warned my players to keep their feet on the ground in order to produce another good performance, Colaco was quoted as saying on the AFC website.         
	Last year too the two teams had met in the group stage. Dempo were hammered 0-4 at home but made amends with a 2-1 win in Bahrain. (PTI)

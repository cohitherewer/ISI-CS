	Calcutta: Snowdens easy victory, in the Amberdue Handicap, brought the curtain down on the 22-day monsoon season on Wednesday.

Vijay, in fact, also saddled the winner of the afternoons main event, the 1,400m Roll N Twist Cup, which the trainers less-fancied runner, Arnatta (Neeraj Rawal-up) won from a friendless Mustang Royal. Alford, on his part, was brilliant atop his two winners  Azureus, a 5-1 shot, and the public-choice Glamorous Spirit.

	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan may rest N.S. Manju and put Dipak Mondal in the centre of defence for Tuesdays match against Al Wehdat of Jordan. The move is planned keeping in mind Bagans I-League match against United Sports Club, scheduled for April 23, which first-choice central defender Peter Odafe will miss due to a double booking.         
	We need to keep players fresh for the I-League. Dipak and Habibur Rahman were rested for our AFC Cup match opener against Al Karama. So, on Tuesday, Dipak will return and Manju will sit out, coach Karim Bencharifa said.         
	Mondal has hardly started as a central defender this season, but the Moroccan didnt see the experienced player facing any difficulties. Dipak enjoys playing in the centre of defence. I dont see him and Odafe having a problem on Tuesday, he said.         
	Bagan will be missing Jose Ramirez Barreto once again. The Brazilian, who picked up a back injury against Churchill Brothers in Goa, skipped the Syrian trip and is not fit enough to have a go at Al Wehdat.         
	Al Wehdat reach the city on Sunday. The weather in Jordan is frighteningly cold but Bencharifa doesnt buy the argument that the heat here puts the hosts in an advantageous position.         
	The perception in Syria was we would find it hard to get ourselves acclimatised. But that thing fell flat and we put up a commendable show. Now, if we think that Wehdat would find it tough in this hot weather, we would have quite a few problems, he said.

                                                   Guptill hits century on debut
                      
	Auckland: A record-setting 122 not out by New Zealand debutant Martin Guptill brightened an otherwise dismal day here Saturday as the fourth one-day International against the West Indies was washed out by rain.         
	Guptill, starting in his specialist opening position after Jesse Ryder was dropped for disciplinary reasons, batted right through the innings as New Zealand made 275 for four.

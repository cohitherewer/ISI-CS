	Karachi: The Pakistani interior ministry Wednesday gave security clearance to the national cricketers to participate in the third edition of the Indian Premier League in March-April next year.         
	The foreign ministry had already given political clearances to the players (for taking part in the IPL) and, now, the interior ministry, too, has given its clearance, an official said.         
	However, it was learnt that the organisers of the league have sought go-aheads for only five players.         
	According to sources, IPL commissioner Lalit Modi had asked PCB to provide NOCs for Kamran Akmal, Sohail Tanvir, Umar Gul, Misbah-ul Haq and new signing, Abdul Razzaq. That is what we have heard. the IPL is not asking for a blanket clearance for all Pakistani players. They have specifically named players for the next IPL season, a source said.         
	While Razzaq is on the Kolkata Knight Riders radar, the rest appeared in the first edition, in 2008.           (PTI)

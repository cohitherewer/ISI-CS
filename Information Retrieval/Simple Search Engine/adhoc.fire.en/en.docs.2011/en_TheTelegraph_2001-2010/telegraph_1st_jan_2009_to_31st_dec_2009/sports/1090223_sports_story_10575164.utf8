	Wellington: India outplayed New Zealand 2-1 in the second Test of the four-match hockey series at the National Stadium here Sunday.         
	An early goal jolted India out of inertia.         
	The home side took the early lead with Simon Child sounding the board in the fourth minute. Stung by the goal, Tushar Khandker restored parity for India in the 30th minute while skipper Sandeep Singh produced the match-winner with a penalty corner conversion in the 55th minute to give his side a 1-0 lead in the series.         
	India, who came up with a vastly improved performance as compared to Saturdays 1-1 draw, could have won by a bigger margin but for the profligate forwards who missed chances galore.         
	India next play two matches against an Invitational XI side.. (PTI)

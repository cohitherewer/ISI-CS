                                                     Big Phils new gamble
            Rory Smith amp; John Ley            Ricardo Quaresma                           
	On Monday morning, Inter Milan left Ricardo Quaresma, the Portugal winger, out of their Champions League squad. A mooted swap with Tottenham for Jermaine Jenas never materialised and, instead, with just 30 minutes until the deadline, Chelsea acquired him on loan.         
	Luiz Felipe Scolari, the Chelsea manager, had insisted less than 24 hours previously that he saw no reason to add to his squad. So what tempted him to change his mind?         
	Quaresmas track record since his move from Porto to Inter, requisitioned by Jose Mourinho, hardly justifies his arrival. Voted the worst signing of the season by fans and chronically short on confidence, he can now add Inter to Barcelona in his list of abortive attempts to succeed at big clubs.         
	Mourinho admitted on Monday that his countryman had found it difficult to cope with all the criticism and was at a loss to explain his poor displays at the San Siro. To many, with his slicked-back hair and tendency to over-elaboration, Quaresma is Cristiano Ronaldo without the end product. Scolari, who worked with him for six years as Portugal manager, knows better.         
	He may have struggled at Barcelona, but he shone at Porto, where his coach Jesualdo Ferreira treated him with kid gloves.         
	He is a bag of tricks, famed for his trivela  crossing with the outside of his boot  and rabona  hitting the ball by wrapping his right foot around his left. On his day, he is magical, unpredictable and every bit as talented as Ronaldo.         
	Sadly, there is a down side, the reason Mourinho farmed him out and Rafael Benitez twice spurned the chance to take him to Liverpool. Quaresma does not work.         
	Both the former Chelsea manager and the current Liverpool manager demand that their wingers never shirk defensive duties. This is where Ronaldo and Quaresma, two years his senior, differ. Alex Ferguson harnessed Ronaldos energy. Quaresma remains true to his first nickname, Mustang. He runs free.         
	But another workhorse is what Chelsea do not need, and that is why the loan move has all the hallmarks of a masterstroke. On a good day, Quaresma could transform those games at Stamford Bridge where Chelsea are frustrated by a massed defence.         
	If Scolari can elicit the best out of his former protege, Chelsea could yet return to the title race. If not, he returns to Inter at the end of the season. It is a win-win situation.         
	Meanwhile, Chelsea won their appeal on Tuesday against Frank Lampards red card at Anfield on Sunday and avoided retrospective action for the blatant kick by defender Jose Bosingwa on Liverpools Yossi Benayoun.         
	Rafael Benitez, the Liverpool manager, called on video evidence to be able to be used in all cases after Chelsea avoided two possible suspensions.         
	Lampard has been cleared to face Aston Villa in a crucial Premier League clash at Villa Park on February 21. If his appeal had failed, he would also have missed the home league game with Hull and the FA Cup fifth-round trip to Watford.         
	Bosingwa apologised for his kick on Benayoun during Chelseas 2-0 defeat and while referee Mike Riley admitted that he had not seen Bosingwas challenge, it had been spotted by assistant Mo Matadar, who chose to take no action.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Boycott call leaves WI in a quandary
                                                   Boycott call leaves WI in a quandary
                      
	Miami: The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) is scrambling to get a team together for the first Test against Bangladesh starting on Thursday after the selected players decided to boycott the match due to contract disputes.         
	WICB president Julian Hunte said on Wednesday that the Test match would go ahead but the team would not be announced until shortly before the game due to fears about intimidation of players.         
	We are playing a Test match in St Vincent against Bangladesh, that is all I can say, Hunte said over telephone.         
	Hunte declined to comment on the recruitment of players but said there had been a lot of intimidation.         
	The WICB chief declined to comment on who had carried out the intimidation or give any details about which players had been approached.         
	However, Jamaican fast bowler Daren Powell, not included in the selected 13 for the game in St. Vincent, said on Wednesday he had been approached by the board to play.         
	Powell, dropped for Mays tour of England but a regular over recent years with 37 Test appearances, said he had turned down the chance to play.         
	I was contacted by the West Indies board but I told them I was not available this time, Powell said.         
	The WICB faces a huge challenge to find a team and make arrangements to get them to St Vincent for the game.         
	The Barbados Nation newspaper reported on Wednesday that 16-year-old Barbadian opening batsman Kraigg Brathwaite was among those who have been approached to play in the first Test.         
	Brathwaite is in Jamaica for the regional Under-19 tournament and the newspaper said that several other Barbadians were being considered including former Test player Tino Best.         
	The West Indies Players Association (WIPA) announced on Tuesday that the Test squad, captained by Chris Gayle, had withdrawn from the series with immediate effect.         
	The WIPA said they were owed payments for recent games and that the players have performed in the last four series without contracts.         
	Heading home. Sorry to all the cricket fans. This is the last thing we want to happen to the game. Need respect and stop taking us for granted, Gayle said on his Twitter feed.         
	The WICB said the boycott was extremely ill advised and premature and said it considered negotiations with the WIPA were ongoing.         
	Media reports in the Caribbean said most players from the West Indies squad had returned to their homes and were not preparing as planned for Thursdays game.         
	The union, which threatened strike action during Englands tour of the Caribbean in March, said the West Indies players have played the last four series without a contract.         
	In a lengthy statement, the WICB detailed the financial disputes between itself and the WIPA regarding payments for the tour of England in May, the Twenty20 World Cup and the recent four-match ODI series against India in the Caribbean.         
	All of those competitions were highlighted by WIPA as being at the centre of the dispute.         
	The WICB said as far as it was concerned negotiations were on to resolve their issues, though the players, who met at the weekend, have clearly lost patience with their employers.         
	Bangladesh are already in the Caribbean having played a warm-up game in Barbados against a West Indies A team.           (REUTERS)

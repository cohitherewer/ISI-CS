                                                     Focus on Amritraj on Day I
            OUR BUREAU            Prakash Amritraj                           
	Mumbai: Leander Paes introduced his partner Lukas Dlouhy to Indian fans; World No. 5 Nikolay Davydenko reached Chennai, and Stanislas Wawrinka, the Swiss who won the doubles gold in Beijing in the company of his more illustrious compatriot Roger Federer, addressed the media.         
	But come Monday, when the hush falls and the action starts in the Chennai Open, the spotlight will be firmly on Prakash Amritraj when he takes on former top-10 Rainer Schuettler of Germany in a first round match at the Nungambakkam stadiums centre court.         
	The US-born Amritraj, 206 in ATP World Tour rankings, has entered the event representing India, a stark irony considering that the government has come up with a decision barring players of Indian origin who, however, are not citizens of the country, ineligible to represent India in sports. Now, the 25-year-old son of former Davis Cup captain Vijay Amritraj has a chance to poke holes in the latest legislation.         
	It wont be easy, though. The 32-year-old Schuettler was once ranked as high as five in 2004 and was a finalist in 1999 in Chennai where he has a 10-7 win-loss record.         
	The Amritraj-Schuettler match is the second on the show court and will be preceded by the clash between third seed Marin Cilic of Croatia and Spaniard Alberto Martin.         
	Davydenko, who will begin his campaign on Tuesday, is of course the title favourite.         
	The other India interests are Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles of the Bahamas, who are the top seeds in the doubles, Somdev Dev Varman, Yuki Bhambri and Harsh Mankad, who have received a wild card in doubles, and Rohan Bopanna.         
	Bopanna eased past Sanam Singh 6-3, 6-4 in the second round of qualifying and faces German Michael Berrer in the final round to be played Monday afternoon.         
	Wawrinka said he was eyeing the Chennai Open as a launch pad for the years first Grand Slam, the Australian Open in Melbourne later this month.         
	It is the first tournament of the year and comes 10 days before the Australian Open. It is the way to the Australian Open and I am very happy to be playing here for the first time, the Swiss said.         
	I have a good chance to win but the first tournament is never easy. I will see how it goes after the first match.         
	Wawrinka has a long-term goal for the season, too. Yes, I hope to win the Masters in London. I will try my best to be in the top eight this year, said the world No.13.         
	Croat Ivo Karlovic, seeded fourth, could be the dark-horse. The 27-year-old has come a long way from being a big server to be ranked 26th on the ATP computer.

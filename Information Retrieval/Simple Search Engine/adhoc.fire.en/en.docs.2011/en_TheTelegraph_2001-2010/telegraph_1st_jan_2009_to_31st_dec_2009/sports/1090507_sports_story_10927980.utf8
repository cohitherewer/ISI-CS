                                                   Dress rehearsal for World T20
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Pakistan and Australia will get some practice for next months World Twenty20 when they play a one-off game at the Dubai Stadium on Thursday.         
	The match will be the last international encounter for both teams before next months tournament in England, and Pakistan captain Younis Khan wants to make the best of it, after losing the one-day series against Australia.         
	We need to take full advantage so that we know where we stand. Its good to have a match against worlds top team, said Younis, whose team lost the one-day series that ended Sunday in the United Arab Emirates 3-2.         
	In the inaugural World Twenty20, held in South Africa in 2007, Pakistan finished runners-up to India and beat Australia in the Super Eight Stage by six wickets  to date the only T20 match between the two teams. But Younis believes Thursdays game will not be an easy one.         
	We have to be at our best to win this match because Australia are dangerous in all forms of the game, said Younis.         
	Pakistan have included two teenagers in their squad of 15 for the World Twenty20, left-arm pacer Mohammed Aamir and spinning all-rounder Shazaib Hassan. However, both will be absent against Australia on Thursday. Australias stand-in skipper, Brad Haddin, who has taken over after Michael Clarke returned home for a rest after the one-day series, hoped for an exciting clash.         
	Its been a great one-day series and Pakistan have some very talented players; a few of those guys can win a game by themselves, said Haddin.

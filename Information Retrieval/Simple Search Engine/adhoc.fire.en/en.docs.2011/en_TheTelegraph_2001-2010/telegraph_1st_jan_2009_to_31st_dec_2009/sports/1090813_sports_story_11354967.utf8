  - Knights Icon helps out juniors with tips during camp at the Eden       A STAFF REPORTER            Ashok Dinda learns a trick or two from Sourav Ganguly during a practice session of the Kolkata Knight Riders at the Eden on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: A day after the Indian Premier League (IPL) decided it would do away with the icon player status from the 2011 edition onwards, Sourav Ganguly, the Kolkata Knight Riders icon player, was Wednesday seen in a new role  that of a mentor  for his franchise.         
	At the Knights fitness camp, being held at the Eden, the former India captain was seen taking an active part  giving suggestions and instructions to the batsmen and the bowlers.         
	The camp was held over two sessions, the first being a net session outdoors while an indoor fitness session later in the afternoon was supervised by physio Andrew Leipus and trainer Adrian le Roux.         
	The pre-season camp is being attended by many of the Knights Indian players. Bengals Wriddhiman Saha, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Arindam Ghosh, Debabrata Das, Ashok Dinda, Sourav Sarkar and Avik Chowdhury sweated it out along with the outstation players like Anureet Singh, Mohnish Parmar and Sunny Singh.         
	Ishank Jaggi, the promising youngster from Jharkhand, was also present. The right-handed batsman, on Royal Challengers Bangalores roster in the last edition of the IPL, is a free player this time and, from the way Sourav took an interest in him on Wednesday, one wouldnt be surprised if the prolific scorer in the domestic meets last season is roped in this season to bolster the Knights batting.         
	Im a free player now, but nothing has been decided yet. I have come just to take part in the camp, Jaggi said when asked if he would be joining the Knights.         
	Monitoring the progress of the players, Sourav himself didnt wield the willow; neither did he rotate his arm. But he had specific advice for almost all the youngsters.         
	While he instructed Wriddhiman to practice playing shots towards the third-man region, for Bengal captain Shukla his advice was to concentrate on the defensive shots.         
	Imagine youve come in when your team is at 30 for three play accordingly, he told Shukla.         
	Among the bowlers, Anureet was impressive with his pace and probing line with Sourav praising the youngster time and again. He shared his expertise with Bengal pacer Dinda trying to teach him the art of bowling the slower one.         
	Complete your bowling action to disguise the batsman with your slower, he instructed Dinda. The players, on their part, were only too happy to get some useful tips from the man who boasts over 10,000 runs in one-day International cricket.         
	Speaking during the breather, Sourav laughed away suggestions that he was playing the coachs role on Wednesday. I was just organising the camp today And it was not only me, the others too were helping me out. The Knights are in the process of appointing a coach and a captain soon, he said.         
	Meanwhile, the franchises will be choosing the Indian Cricket League (ICL)-returnee Indian players from a draft organised by the IPL.         
	According to sources, the Knights have a few names in mind, like Rajagopal Sathish and Ganapathi Vignesh (both represented the Chennai Superstars in the ICL) and a few international players like Imran Nazir, Craig McMillan and Justin Kemp.

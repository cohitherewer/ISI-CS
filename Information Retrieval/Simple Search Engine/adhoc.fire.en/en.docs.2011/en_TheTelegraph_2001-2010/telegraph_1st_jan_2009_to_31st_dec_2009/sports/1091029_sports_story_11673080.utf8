The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | De Ridder makes a comeback
                                                     De Ridder makes a comeback
  - I-League 
  -  Red and Gold brigade gets a new man at the helm; Karims boys upbeat vs Lajong         A STAFF REPORTER            Philippe de Ridder                                 
	Calcutta: Its official. Phillippe de Ridder is the new coach of East Bengal. The Belgian has agreed to the terms and conditions and will be reaching town in another 10 days.         
	Philippe de Ridder will be our coach for the remaining season. His appointment letter has already been faxed to the Indian embassy in Brussels and he is likely to apply for visa by Thursday, clubs football secretary Santosh Bhattacharya informed.         
	East Bengal actually decided to go ahead with the Belgian on Monday itself. But at the same time were flirting with former Churchill Brothers coach Zoran Djordjevic who asked for an astronomical $10,000 per month as salary.         
	 De Ridders case was also helped by a strong recommendation from a very senior player, a top East Bengal official said on Wednesday.         
	The official version though is something different. Having worked with East Bengal previously (he took over as the coach in 2005-06 after Bhowmick had quit) he knows the way this club works.         
	Officials thought that his familiarity with the players will help him to adapt quickly, Bhattacharya informed.         
	So what does Bhaichung Bhutia has to say about the man who holds him in such high esteem? I am happy that De Ridder is our coach. But at the same time it doesnt matter who is our coach. I am a professional and will work under anyone.         
	All the players should now co-operate with the new coach and bring the club out from the rut that it is in at this moment, Bhaichung said on Wednesday evening.         
	Speaking from Brussels, De Ridder said he was excited about getting another chance to coach East Bengal. I know the players and am looking forward to my second stint with the club, he told The Telegraph.         
	De Ridder said that he would be in town as soon as possible. It depends on how fast I get the visa and the work permit.         
	Yet to talk to Bhaichung  he said the time difference was a factor  De Ridder hasnt seen any replay of the Sunday derby either. I havent seen the match. Just heard of the outcome, he said.         
	As to his plans, he said: The players will have to show character in this time of distress.         
	On his last assignment with the club, he had been hell bent on Bhaichung being made the captain for the national league; will he ask for something similar this time?         
	Look, its not that your best player has to be the skipper. If it happens then its good. Basically, I want the captain to lead from the front. He should have the guts and the gumption, he added.         
	East Bengal, under De Ridder, were on course for the National League title but ultimately finished runners-up to Mahindra United. They, however, had won the Super Cup.         
	Like last time, the Belgian comes at a time when the teams confidence is at its lowest ebb. He gave the club players like Anupam Sarkar and resurrected Jayanta Sens career. How he handles his resources this time remains to be seen. Bhaichung though is upbeat.         
	If he can repeat what he did with the club in 2005-06 then we will be different team altogether.

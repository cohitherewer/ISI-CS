	Wembley: Manchester United won the League Cup with a 4-1 penalty shootout victory over Tottenham on Sunday that kept the English league leaders on course for an unprecedented five trophies this season.         
	After a 0-0 draw through extra time, United goalkeeper Ben Foster saved Tottenhams first shootout kick from Jamie Hara and David Bentley missed the third before Anderson hit the winning penalty.         
	The victory gave United their second trophy of the season following Decembers Club World Cup title. The Red Devils also lead the Premier League by seven points and are in contention for the Champions League and FA Cup.         
	United showed the resources they will have to draw upon if they are to triumph in their other competitions this season, introducing substitutes Nemanja Vidic, Ryan Giggs and Anderson to bolster the line-up against a Tottenham side playing with confidence.         
	Foster made two crucial saves during the match to deny Aaron Lennon and Darren Bent and prevent defending champions Tottenham from retaining the trophy. But United could have also won the match in regulation time when Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored in the shootout alongside Giggs and Carlos Tevez, hit the post in injury time.         
	Uniteds defence had appeared uncharacteristically shaky as Lennon continually ran at and past left back Patrice Evra, sending in cross after cross.         
	Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp brought on Jamie Hara to help collect those crosses in the 65th minute, but that was towards the end of his teams most threatening spell. Foster saved Lennons fierce shot in the 71st and then did the same to Bent in extra time.         
	The difference between the teams seemed to be the strength in depth. While Hara and Bentley both missed penalties after coming on as substitutes, Giggs scored for United.         
	United started each half strongly but, both times, Jermaine Jenas and Didier Zokora began to deny Paul Scholes space in midfield, forcing Tevez to drop deep in search of possession.         
	United were unable to convert their majority possession into clear opportunities as Ronaldo put two free kicks over the bar and Tottenham defenders Michael Dawson and Ledley King made diving blocks to get in the way of efforts by Tevez and Darron Gibson.         
	Many of Spurs best chances were wasted by Roman Pavyluchenko, who put a free header high and wide while unmarked and did the same with a free kick before being replaced by Hara.         
	That allowed Luka Modric to push up in support of Bent and led to a period of sustained pressure as Zokora, Modric and Lennon probed patiently for an opening that eventually came in the 71st. Modric allowed a cross to run to Lennon on the right of the area and his hard shot sailed past Jonny Evans but was pushed away by Foster.         
	Ronaldo had been subdued by Tottenham left back Beniot Assou-Ekotto for most of the match and his attacking efforts curtailed further by a 67th-minute yellow card for diving in the area.         
	With United vulnerable, manager Alex Ferguson brought on Vidic as a 76th-minute replacement for John Shea, pushing Evans out to right back and restoring his first-choice central partnership of Vidic and Rio Ferdinand.         
	Spurs still threatened, particularly when Foster stopped Bents rebound shot after Modric had an effort blocked, but United were too strong.           (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Flintoff move has precedents
                                                     Flintoff move has precedents
  - The twenty20 action: moolah talks, but stings too         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                Andrew Flintoff                                   
	Calcutta: The traditionalists may have applauded Clive Lloyd, but Andrew Flintoff has reason to feel aggrieved with the iconic chairman of the International Cricket Council (ICC) cricket committee and a fellow-Lancastrian.         
	After all, speaking at the ICCs history conference in Oxford the other day, Lloyd singled out the hero of Englands recent Ashes win at Lords for a critical mention.         
	It is a bit unfortunate that Flintoff has decided to leave Test cricket, he said, pointing out that the all-rounder had set a dangerous precedent by making himself available for ODIs and T20 only.         
	Fact is that the precedent was set by Scott Styris, back in November 2007. Some weeks later, Sanath Jayasuriya followed suit. Then, somebody like Shahid Afridi hasnt played Test cricket for three years and has gone on record saying he prefers the shorter versions.         
	Actually, just days after Flintoff announced that the ongoing Ashes would be his last Test series, Chaminda Vaas let it be known that he wouldnt be seen in whites after Friday.         
	Thats not all.         
	Lloyd forgot that Chris Gayle, the West Indies captain till the rebellion over contracts, had done his bit to run down Test cricket, ironically at a time he was supposed to be promoting this summers away-series against England!         
	The connoisseurs were aghast.         
	Lloyd also spoke about lucrative T20 tournaments hurting international crickets oldest version. Well, theres nothing more lucrative around than the Indian Premier League (IPL) and it doesnt surprise that be it Jayasuriya or Flintoff or Vaas or Styris, all have their sights on its third edition, in 2010.         
	Moolah talks. Stings too.         
	In fact, the IPLs riches have corrupted some of the cricketers in more ways than one, only hardly anybody will concede that.         
	One of Indias top cricket administrators, though, did get candid during the IPLs last edition, in South Africa.         
	Its because of the IPL... that some players are just not keen on going through the grind of domestic cricket... When theyre assured of lakhs (of Rupees) for bowling no more than four overs in a T20 match, why sweat it out in the Ranji Trophy? Somebody has to review this whole business, hed told The Telegraph in Durban.         
	Of course, yes, but who will that somebody be?         
	Even somebody as distinguished as Lloyd can, at best, make recommendations. Or, when the opportunity arises, lament at history conferences.         
	While on T20, an issue which should really worry national Boards is the IPL-induced wear and tear on cricketers.         
	Virender Sehwag, Zaheer Khan, Kevin Pietersen, Flintoff All either got injured during the second edition or aggravated a problem.         
	The franchises didnt suffer at all or werent hurt much, but the national teams took a hit.         
	Surely, theres something wrong with priorities.         
	There was a time when there would be misgivings over an umpteen number of ODI meets across the globe, from Canada to Singapore. Now, the ICC is itself organising two World T20 tournaments within a year!         
	If Pakistan cannot retain their World T20 title, in the West Indies next May, then their reign as champions would be for less than 11 months.         
	Such an eventuality wont amuse anybody.

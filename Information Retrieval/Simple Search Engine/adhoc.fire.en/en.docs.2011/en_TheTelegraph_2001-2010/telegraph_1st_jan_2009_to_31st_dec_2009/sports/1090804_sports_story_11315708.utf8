The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I have the technique to open: Watson
                                                   I have the technique to open: Watson
                      
	Melbourne: All-rounder Shane Watson believes he can be a solution to Australias opening problem and feels he has the technique and temperament to counter the moving new ball.         
	I have absolutely loved the challenge of opening the batting and I feel that I have the technique to open, said Watson, who scored an impressive 62 as a makeshift opener during Australias first innings in the ongoing third Ashes Test in Birmingham.         
	I have no doubt I have the mental and technical aspects to be able to open the batting and consistently do well. I just have to perform and form a really good partnership with Simon Katich, he added.         
	The 28-year-old Tasmanian, however, said he was little nervous initially when asked to replace struggling Phil Hughes at the top.         
	I was probably the most nervous I have been before I went out to bat, but once I got through a few overs, I felt fine, Watson was quoted as saying by a local newspaper. To be able to face the fresh English bowlers on a brand-new wicket with a brand new ball was a great challenge and I really enjoyed it.         
	The development of my technique means I have been able to take it on more comfortably than I did previously. The one opening stint I had 18 months ago was very poor, he said. But to be able to develop the game I have the past six months, particularly technically, meant I had the best chance to combat the new ball and English bowlers.         
	He credited former India coach Greg Chappell, who is now the head coach of Cricket Australias Centre of Excellence in Brisbane, for the improvement in his technique. (PTI)

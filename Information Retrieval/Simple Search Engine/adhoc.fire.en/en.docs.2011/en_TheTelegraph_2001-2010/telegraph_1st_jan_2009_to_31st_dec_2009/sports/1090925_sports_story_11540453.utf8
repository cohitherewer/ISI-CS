	Johannesburg: In a change of plans, Yuvraj Singh will be consulting a specialist on Friday and, only then, will a decision be taken on his returning home.         
	The Team India vice-captain fractured the little finger of his right hand on Wednesday and is out of the Champions Trophy. In fact, as of now, hell be off cricket for six weeks.         
	One cant do anything about injuries... I cant keep feeling bad... I know Id hurt my (left) knee in the last Champions Trophy, but I still wouldnt say the tournament is jinxed for me, Yuvraj told The Telegraph on Thursday evening.         
	Yuvrajs India debut, incidentally, had been in the 2000 ICC KnockOut (in Nairobi), as the Champions Trophy was then known.         
	Replacement Virat Kohli, meanwhile, is expected to arrive on Friday.

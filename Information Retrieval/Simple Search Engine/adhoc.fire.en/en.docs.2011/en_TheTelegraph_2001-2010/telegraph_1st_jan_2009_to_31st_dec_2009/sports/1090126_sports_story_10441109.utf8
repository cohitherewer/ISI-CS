	Bangalore: Central Zones Mohammed Kaif on Sunday played a captains knock of 87 runs to draw the match but could not prevent South Zone from entering the Duleep Trophy semi-finals by virtue of their narrow three-run first innings lead.         
	Resuming at the overnight score of 345 for six, South Zone were all out for 377 to set Central 381 for victory on the fourth and final day of the match at the Chinnaswamy Stadium.         
	Central ended up with 255 for nine in 67.4 overs with leg-spinner M. Suresh taking six wickets and Robin Uthappa returning figures of three for 26.         
	Central started well with openers Tanmay Srivastava (44) and Shivakant Shukla (31) adding 71 runs, but wrecker-in-chief Suresh collected three wickets in quick succession as South took control of proceedings.         
	Suresh struck with his first ball to get rid of Srivastava before lunch and on resumption, dismissed Yere Goud and Shukla. With the openers and Goud back in the pavilion, Kaif and Parvinder Singh steadied the innings, but Suresh triggered another collapse and Central lost three wickets for 29 to find themselves reeling at 184 for six.         
	At tea, Central Zone reached 207 for six with Piyush Chawla giving Kaif company.         
	Chawla contributed a valuable 22 in a 48-run seventh-wicket partnership with Kaif to prolong the innings, and helped prevent his team from getting bundled out.         
	Earlier, Centrals Pankaj Singh finished with five for 90 as South lost their overnight centurion Dinesh Karthick without adding anything to his overnight score of 103.         
	He edged Umesh Yadav to Naman Ojha, who rounded off a solid performance behind the stumps with six dismissals in the innings.         
	Pankaj removed L. Balaji and S. Sreesanth off successive deliveries to wrap up the innings for 377 and claim his sixth five-wicket haul in first-class cricket.         
	Central would have been shut out of the game much earlier in the day had it not been for Pankaj Singhs blistering spell in the morning. Bowling with the same verve that was on display early on the third day, he had the in-form Karthik dismissed off the second ball.

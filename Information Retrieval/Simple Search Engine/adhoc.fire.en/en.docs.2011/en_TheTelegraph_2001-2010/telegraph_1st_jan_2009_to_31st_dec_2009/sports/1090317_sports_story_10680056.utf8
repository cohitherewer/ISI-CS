                                                     Bucknor blasts bully BCCI
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Steve Bucknor                           
	Calcutta/Melbourne: Controversial umpire Steve Bucknor claims the Indian cricket board used its money power to get him removed from the Perth Test during Indias tour of Australia last year.         
	Bucknor was removed from the Perth Test after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) threatened to pull out of the Australian tour, due to his controversial decisions, which largely went against India, in the second Test in Sydney.         
	The 62-year-old umpires problems were further compounded when the then India captain Anil Kumble filed a negative report against him for his dubious decisions during the Sydney game.         
	I know that in the life of everyone there are going to be good times and bad times. I have survived for a long time. Had it not been for strong-willed people within the ICC I might have been out due to negative reactions from certain quarters.         
	When you speak to a captain and hes not happy you are reported. If his (national) association is strong enough they may believe that they should take action.         
	Oh, this umpire shouldnt be within the system because the captain is seeing something wrong, he was quoted as saying.         
	The BCCI refused to comment on the issue. I dont want to comment I dont wish to say anything without verifying his statement, joint secretary Sanjay Jagdale said.         
	Bucknor, who has already announced that Thursdays third Test between South Africa and Australia in Cape Town will be his 128th and last, said the sacking didnt surprise him.         
	I knew there would have been a moment when things would not have gone as well.         
	But at the same time, I made two mistakes out of more than 40 calls. There are others who will say getting 90 per cent in a game is relatively good, the Jamaican said.         
	I got better than 94 per cent in that particular game but it wasnt good enough for some people. So I was expecting these things to happen because on Earth ... there are some people who are more equal than others.         
	Because they are more equal, they seem to have more say. And what they say, especially influenced by money, they seem to have their way. So Im not too surprised.         
	Bucknor, who has stood in a record five World Cup finals during his 20-year career, said Vivian Richards was the best batsman and Shane Warne the best bowler he saw in his eventful career.         
	The tough bowlers. Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Andre Nel. Even when at times they are annoyed, later on Glenn McGrath will say Steve, I thought that was the correct decision, but Im coming back for another one.         
	So I dont mind it. I like the tough guys, those who will question you. Not being rude but just you know saying, what was that missing Steve, if you say so, Ill accept it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its an immature decision: Saina
                                                   Its an immature decision: Saina
                      
	Hyderabad: Englands pull out from the World Badminton Championships evoked strong reactions from the shuttlers. Here are some of the reactions (in alphabetical order).         
	Chetan Anand: It leaves a bad impression not only on badminton but also on other sports as a whole. The European countries do not perceive India as safe and secure which is not good for the sport. But there are many teams who have turned up and I hope it will not affect the game much. Of course now that they have pulled out there will be some open places but its okay.         
	Peter Gade: Obviously when something of this sort (the threat) happens, family members back home are worried and concerned about our safety. But I am sure with the sort of arrangement that the BWF have put in place, there should not be any problem. I have faith on the association.         
	Jwala Gutta: Its shocking. I dont think such nonsense threats could have affected the game. Its sad because it shows they dont have faith in the organisers. There are some English mixed doubles and a doubles pairs who are really good and it is going to affect the championship.         
	Saina Nehwal: Its an immature decision but I dont think it makes much of a difference to the tournament because there are no English top players in the singles event. I think they should have been more patient. Even Gopi sir spoke to them Saturday. In India, badminton is not as big as cricket so I dont think there was any need to be worry. The tournament will go on without an issue and I dont foresee any trouble for anyone. I think they panicked since Independence Day celebrations are round the corner.

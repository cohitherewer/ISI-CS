The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Could have won the race: Fisichella 
                                                   Could have won the race: Fisichella 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Spa-Francorchamps: The jinx is finally broken after 29 false starts. The Italian driver Giancarlo Fisichella finished second to give Force India their maiden points  eight  in the Belgian Grand Prix, here on Sunday.         
	Kimi Raikkonen won the race holding off a strong challenge from the veteran driver. Fisichella, rumoured to have one foot in Ferrari, shunned extravagance to run a flawless race and trailed Raikkonen, which had snatched the lead using the Kinetic Energy Recovery System, all the way for a podium finish. The Italian finished less than a second behind Raikkonen.         
	Fisichellas Force India teammate Adrian Sutil had a rather rollercoaster outing with the German eventually finishing 11th.         
	With this, Fisichella renewed his tryst with Spa, which has traditionally been benign to him.         
	It was at the same track in 1997 that Fisichella had finished second in a Jordan car.         
	For a car without the KERS boost, Fisichella displayed amazing racecraft in a race marked and marred by opening lap pile-up, early safety car and pit-stop fumbles.         
	Even though Fisichella was elated with the show, the Italian felt he could have won the race but for KERS.         
	Of course I could have won it. Its a great result. The target was to win our first points and I finished second to get eight points. So that is great but Im still a little sad since I could have won the race, Fisichella said.         
	I was quicker than Kimi and its only because of KERS that he got ahead of me. Still I kept pressing hard and finished less than one second behind the leader, which is great, he added.         
	The race was overshadowed by a multiple accident on the opening lap which wrecked the hopes of drivers championship leader Jenson Button of Brawn and defending champion Lewis Hamilton, of McLaren Mercedes, both of them crashing out.         
	German Sebastian Vettel came home third for Red Bull to jump back up to third in the title race with 53 points behind Button on 72 and his Brawn GP teammate Brazilian Rubens Barrichello on 56 with five races remaining.         
	Pole Robert Kubica was fourth for BMW Sauber ahead of his teammate German Nick Heidfeld with Finn Heikki Kovalainen sixth for McLaren Mercedes.         
	Barrichello was seventh, nursing his car stricken by an oil leak over the closing laps, and German Nico Rosberg eighth for Williams.         
	It was Raikkonens 18th career win but his first since the 2008 Spanish Grand Prix  a welcome tonic for the Ferrari team after a torrid year.         
	Raikkonen said: We havent brought new parts for the last few races as we are looking at next year.         
	But my aim was always still to win a race because we are aiming for third in the (constructors) championship.         
	We probably werent the fastest in terms of lap time, but we were able to keep everybody behind us. Hopefully we can now win more.

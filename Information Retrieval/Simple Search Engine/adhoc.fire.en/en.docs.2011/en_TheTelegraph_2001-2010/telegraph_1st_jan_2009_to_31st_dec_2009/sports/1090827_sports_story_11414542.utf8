The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India camp to begin today
                                                   India camp to begin today
                      
	Bangalore: A four-day preparatory camp for the Indian squad ahead of the tri-Series in Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy commences here from Thursday. The players would have indoor sessions on the first day while outdoor sessions are slated from Friday.         
	Coach Gary Kirsten would oversee the camp and will be assisted by Ramji Srinivasan, who has been appointed as the teams trainer for the tri-series.               
	Calcutta: Australian Brad Haddin will undergo a corrective surgery on the fractured right finger of the left hand, a Cricket Australia release said. The surgery, which will be done on Thursday, makes Haddin doubtful for the ICC Champions Trophy in September and the subsequent tour of India in October.               
	New Delhi: Muttiah Muralidharan was Wednesday signed up by the Australian domestic club Victorian Bushrangers to play in the KFC Twenty20 Big Bash competition in the 2009-10 season. What a thrill it will be to play in front of a home crowd at the mighty MCG, representing Victoria in a strong competition, said Muralidharan.               
	Karachi: Pakistan is capable of winning the ICC Champions Trophy next month in South Africa but they would have to play as a team rather than individuals, feels former skipper Javed Miandad. If we can play with the same spirit and co-ordination that we showed in the T20 World Cup there is no reason why we cant repeat the same success in the Champions Trophy, Miandad said.               
	Karachi: Twenty-two Pakistani players, who are still associated with the unauthorised Indian Cricket League (ICL), will be submitting their resignations soon and seek NOCs from the ICL authorities. Rana Naved, Imran Nazir, Mohammed Yousuf, Abdul Razzaq and Imran Farhat are the five players who have already severed ties with the ICL.               
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ejaz Butt said that the venues for the one-day series against New Zealand, scheduled to be held later this year, would be decided in the next ten days. Nothing has been finalised as yet but I am hopeful that after positive discussions with the Abu Dhabi and Dubai officials we will finalise the match venues in the next 10 days, Butt said.               
	London: Australian spin legend Shane Warne feels that leg-spinner Adil Rashid, and not pacer Stuart Broad, is the best bet to fill in England all-rounder Andrew Flintoffs shoes in Test cricket. Yes, hes a spin bowler rather than a seamer, but there is no reason why England cant go with three pacers and two spinners. Thats a balanced attack, to me, he said.

	Dhonis 61 not out against Sri Lanka in his sides first ODI of the five-match series has enabled the 27-year-old wicketkeeper batsman to regain his place at the head of the table. There will be ample opportunity for Dhoni to put daylight between him and the chasing pack as the rest of the series unfolds in Colombo.

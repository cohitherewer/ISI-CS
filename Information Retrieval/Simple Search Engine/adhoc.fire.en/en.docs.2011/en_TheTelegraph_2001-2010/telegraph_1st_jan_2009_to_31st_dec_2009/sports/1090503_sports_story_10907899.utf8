The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | F1 can survive without Ferrari: Mosley
                                                   F1 can survive without Ferrari: Mosley
                      
	London: Formula One could live without Ferrari if they were to walk away in protest at the introduction of a budget cap, according to International Automobile Federation president Max Mosley.         
	In an interview published in a financial daily on Saturday, Mosley said that he was locked in a power struggle that he intended to win. He made clear that he would not be backing down over allowing teams to compete with a voluntary 40 million ($59.56 million) cap in 2010 in exchange for greater technical freedom than others remaining with unrestricted budgets.         
	The move, described by Mosley as by far the biggest development in my time in the sport, has been welcomed by potential new entries as well as independent teams pitted against big-spending manufacturers.         
	However, Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo wrote to Mosley this week warning against creating a two-tier Formula One that could be fundamentally unfair and perhaps even biased. Montezemolo has also warned that Ferraris continued presence should not be taken for granted.         
	The sport could survive without Ferrari, said Mosley, adding: It would be very, very sad to lose Ferrari. It is the Italian national team.         
	Mosley said there were elements among existing teams who felt that the teams should be running Formula One rather than the FIA or Bernie Ecclestone. (Reuters)

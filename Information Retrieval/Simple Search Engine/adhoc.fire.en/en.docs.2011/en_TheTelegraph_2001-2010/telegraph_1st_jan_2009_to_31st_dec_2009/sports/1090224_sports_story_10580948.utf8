The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Old foes, new stage
                                                   Old foes, new stage
                      
	London: Wherever you look this week in the Champions League, be it Madrid or London, intrigue, personality clashes and rarity value abound as the 16 survivors in the continents elite competition set their sights on Rome.         
	On Wednesday Real Madrid host Liverpool in the Spanish capital in the first competitive meeting of two of Europes powerhouse clubs since the 1981 final.         
	Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez will view the tie as a welcome break from the depressing realisation that his sides chances of winning the English title are vanishing rapidly in a cloud of dust kicked up by a rampant Manchester United.         
	Captain Steven Gerrard was named in Liverpools squad, after missing almost three weeks with a hamstring injury, for their Champions League trip to Real Madrid, who warmed up with a 6-1 thrashing of Real Betis on Saturday.         
	An equally rare fixture takes place in Milans San Siro 24 hours earlier when holders Manchester United face Serie A leaders Inter Milan in the first leg of a tie that has been eagerly awaited since the draw was made.         
	It is 10 years since the sides last met during which time Alex Ferguson has continued churning out silverware at Old Trafford and Inter have re-established themselves as the leading force in Italian football.         
	A few managers have come and gone at Inter since that 1999 clash won by United but the presence of Jose Mourinho, the latest in the hotseat, means a rivalry that once illuminated English football is set to be rekindled.         
	Ferguson knows all too well that the Portuguese will possibly prove his most dangerous adversary in attempting to retain the title.         
	After all, statistics show Mourinho, a Champions League winner with Porto, has got the better of Ferguson most of the time  winning six, drawing five and losing one of their 12 meetings.         
	Ferguson has included injured defenders John Shea and Jonny Evans in his squad the away clash with Inter.         
	The European champions are without suspended Nemanja Vidic, while fellow defenders Wes Brown, Gary Neville and Rafael have been ruled out through injury.         
	Claudio Ranieri, the man who was axed to make way for Mourinhos glittering reign at Stamford Bridge, gets the chance to remind Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich of his qualities when Juventus travel to London on Wednesday for what surprisingly is the first ever meeting between the clubs. It will also mark the return to the competition of Dutch master Guus Hiddink, the man who steered PSV Eindhoven to the European crown in 1988.         
	Favourites Barcelona, who suffered a rare blip at the weekend in Spain when they lost to Espanyol, travel to French leaders Lyon who have reached the last 16 for the fifth successive season. Arsenals home tie against Roma on Tuesday adds to the Anglo-Italian theme of the week as Arsene Wenger tries to remedy his sides goal drought that has resulted in three consecutive 0-0 draws in the league.         
	Bayern Munich, the sole German survivors, face Sporting Lisbon, one of two Portuguese sides left along with Porto who face Atletico Madrid.           (REUTERS)

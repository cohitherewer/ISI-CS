The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India beat WI, but in vain
                                                   India beat WI, but in vain
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India thrashed the West Indies by eight-wickets in Sydney on Thursday but the result was not good enough to ensure them a place in Sundays summit-clash of the ICC Womens World Cup.         
	For progressing to the final, India not only needed to beat the West Indies, but New Zealand should have lost to Pakistan and England had to beat Australia in their respective Super Six matches.         
	India, however, got a chance to make amends for the disappointment, as the win over West Indies ensured them a place in the third-place playoff match against Australia on Saturday. Both teams automatically qualify for the next World Cup.

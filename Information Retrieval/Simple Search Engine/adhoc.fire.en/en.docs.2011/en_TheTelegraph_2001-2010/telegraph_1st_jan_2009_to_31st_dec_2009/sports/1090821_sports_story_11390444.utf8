The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Reds put Stoke to sword
                                                     Reds put Stoke to sword
                    Torres                
	London: Liverpool put an opening defeat to Tottenham Hotspur behind them with a 4-0 home victory over Stoke City Thursday.         
	Coach Rafa Benitezs boys went ahead to Stoke early on when Spanish striker Fernando Torres met Steven Gerrards cross to score before Glen Johnson grabbed a second just before the break.         
	Great work from captain Gerrard allowed Dutchman Dirk Kuyt to add a third on 78 minutes and David Ngog added a fourth late in the game.         
	Tottenham too had reason to be happy about their Thursday outing.         
	Spurs became the new league leaders after thrashing Hull City 5-1 with England striker Jermain Defoe grabbing a hattrick.         
	They lead Chelsea on goal difference after Carlo Ancelottis side made it two wins out of two with victory over Sunderland on Tuesday.         
	Arsenal are third on three points having played only one game.         
	Birmingham Citys 1-0 victory over Portsmouth, with a last-gasp penalty from James McFadden, meant there is yet to be a drawn match in the new Premier League season.

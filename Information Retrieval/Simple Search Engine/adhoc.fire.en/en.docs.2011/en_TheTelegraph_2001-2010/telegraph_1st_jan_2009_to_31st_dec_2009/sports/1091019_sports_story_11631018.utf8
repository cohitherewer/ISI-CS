The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tweddle turns on the heat
                                                   Tweddle turns on the heat
                      
	London: Britains Beth Tweddle emphatically defied any notion she was a one-apparatus gymnast when she took the floor title at the world championships on Sunday.         
	The 24-year-old had been touted for a medal in the asymmetric bars but the 2006 world champion failed to reach the final after losing her grip and falling to the floor in qualifying.         
	Bars was what I thought I was here for, she told reporters. Everyone expects me to medal on bars. To come out with a world title on floor, it just shows that Im not just a one-piece gymnast. I was pretty emotional the other day. I dont know how many texts I got saying keep your chin up         
	The Britons entrance into the Arena brought the crowd alive and any thoughts that she may have struggled to overcome her bars disappointment soon disappeared as they clapped along to the music and cheered the acrobatic tumbling in her technically challenging routine.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Serena, Maria reach last eight
                                                   Serena, Maria reach last eight
                      
	Toronto: Maria Sharapova beat fellow-Russian Vera Zvonareva 6-2, 7-6 (3) Thursday to join Serena Williams in the quarter finals of the Rogers Cup.         
	After waiting out a storm that suspended play for an hour, Sharapova eliminated the No. 7 seed to advance past the third round of the Canadian tournament for the first time.         
	Zvonareva won four straight games in the second set before Sharapova recovered to force the tiebreaker, which she won easily.         
	Serena had a much easier time, beating Ukraines Alona Bondarenko 6-1, 6-4, two days after sister Venus Williams fell to Kateryna Bondarenko.         
	Serena will next face Lucie Safarova of the Czech Republic. The second-ranked Williams is the highest-seeded player left in the tournament after No. 1 Dinara Safina lost Wednesday.

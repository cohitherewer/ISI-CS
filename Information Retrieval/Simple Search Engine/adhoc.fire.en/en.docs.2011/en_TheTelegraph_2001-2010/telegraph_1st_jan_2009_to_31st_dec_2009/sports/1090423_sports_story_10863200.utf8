                                                     Partying over, it will be back to business
    - Knight Riders run into defending champions Rajasthan Royals today           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Shah Rukh Khan                                 
	Cape Town: Thankfully, the Knights didnt have an early morning flight from Durban, on Wednesday, otherwise it couldve been difficult for some at least to make it after partying till the wee hours.         
	The first party, organised by a Kolkata Knight Riders sponsor, had been a scheduled one. The second was a last-minute affair, at principal owner Shah Rukh Khans initiative.         
	No... No... No... We must have our own party, Shah Rukh told associates, happy that his team opened its account in IPL 2009, at the Kings XI Punjabs expense, on Tuesday.         
	Shah Rukhs was held at the team hotel, Southern Sun Elangeni, and was attended by the Sachin Tendulkars and Yuvraj Singhs too. The Kings XI co-owner, Preity Zinta, also turned up.         
	Apparently, Shah Rukh wanted to give a short speech, but the venue became so crowded that the idea was given up.         
	The partying over, it will be back to business, at Newlands here, on Thursday. Thats when the Knights run into the Rajasthan Royals, the reigning champions.         
	Incidentally, John Buchanan, the Knights head of cricket operations, reached Cape Town on Tuesday night itself.         
	My wife and two children have come here for a few days and, so, I wanted to spend some time with them, Buchanan said.         
	Asked by The Telegraph if, like captain Brendon McCullum, hed been relieved with the win in Durban, Buchanan replied: Well, yes... I was keen on an improved performance (compared to the one against the Deccan Chargers) and wasnt disappointed.         
	He added: Its good to settle down and the next step is to be consistent... Dont think we need to do anything special against the Royals... We just need to play our game and the more consistent we get, the better the results...         
	McCullum, unofficial vice-captain Brad Hodge, coach Matthew Mott and Buchanan met by the majestic Cullinan hotels poolside for around 45 minutes shortly after the Knights checked-in.         
	Weve looked at certain things, but we havent decided whether to go for an option, Buchanan remarked.         
	One option could be resting Ashok Dinda and playing Anureet Singh, regarded very highly by Buchanan, instead.         
	Because of the travelling, the Knights had a day off, except for a pool session.         
	Match starts: 8 pm (IST).

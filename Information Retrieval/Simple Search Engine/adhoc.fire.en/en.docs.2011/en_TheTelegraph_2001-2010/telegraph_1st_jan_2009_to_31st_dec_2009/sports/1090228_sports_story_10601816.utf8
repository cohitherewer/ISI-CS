            STAR RACER                                    
	Calcutta: In an 11-horse field, there are one too many claimants for the 2,400m Eveready Calcutta Derby Stakes, making the star attraction in Saturdays nine-event card, one of the most competitive classics in recent times. In fact, seven of them are outstation challengers eying for Rs 68 lakh-plus winners purse  an all time high prize money for this edition of the classic.          
	The Derby may, however, turn out to be a three-cornered contest between the Bangalore challenger, Abs Fabs, who has matched strides against the best in her home ground, and the two horses who occupied the top slots in the 2,000 Guineas  Noble View and Raghuvansh. Noble View, however, had to be driven full steam to beat the late challenge of Raghuvansh in the 2,000 Guineas. The finishing effort of Raghuvansh was impressive, therefore, it may tilt the balance in favour of the Arti Doctor-trained horse who will be ridden by Samuel Fargeat.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

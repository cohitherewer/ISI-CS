The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Something is wrong with Calcutta football: Bob
                                                   Something is wrong with Calcutta football: Bob
            ANSHUMAN ROY                            
	Barcelona: Bob Houghton has been busy ever since he arrived in Barcelona with the Indian team. He is keeping every detail of the preparatory camp, exchanging notes with the support staff, telling them how to go about it in different situations. In the afternoons, its time for practice sessions where he keeps a tab on everything.         
	He has been giving interviews to local channels and was presented with a Barcelona shirt by the famous club. The national coach spoke to The Telegraph about the teams upcoming engagements and why it was important for India to consistently produce results. Football is very big in this city. Its a way of life, he says. Everyone talks football let us also do that.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q The Indian team had their preparatory camps in Portugal in the last two years. Why suddenly Barcelona?         
	A FC Barcelona made the first move. Obviously they had the Indian market in mind and thats why they wanted the national team to use their practice facilities. I came here some six weeks back to see the facilities and was very impressed. It is on the outskirts and very quiet. Ideally suited for the Indian team. But then they dug up the ground there and we were requested to use the ground in between La Masia and Camp Nou. This ground too is top class although I think the facilities in Portugal were better. But then Barcelona is a big city, a big club. Yeah, I think we are doing well.         
	The forthcoming Nehru Cup is being seen as a preparation for the 2011 Asian Cup. Isnt it looking too far ahead for a team like India who can have a very good first half and then a horrific next six months?         
	Yeah, its true. Its too far and too many things can happen. Theres no constant in soccer. But then we cant sit back. We have to prepare for the Asian Cup beginning now itself. You see, to make the game popular in India, to compete with cricket, the national team has to consistently perform well. And participation in the Asian Cup will generate a lot of interest.         
	Many players in important positions, like Bhaichung Bhutia, Rennedy Singh and Deepak Mondal are past their prime. How long, do you think, can they be pushed?         
	Senior players have to be handled differently. You cant have the same training session for everyone. Unlike the younger players, who are always bubbling with energy and can be pushed to the extreme, the seniors need rest in between. Thats a very common practice in world football. We have reinforcements in Anthony Fernandes, N. Mohanraj, Govin Singh and Sushil Singh. I am very impressed with Sushil Singh. Strongly built, fast and aggressive. You may sneer at him for his poor rate of conversion but then he barely had some 12 starts in the last I-League. But still he managed to score seven goals.         
	Do you see most of the senior players around for the 2011 Asian Cup?         
	Not all of them.         
	You gave everyone a look in on Saturday in the first match. But you didnt change the goalkeeper Subrata Paul. Will it be only Paul under the bar for the rest of the tour?         
	The reason I kept him throughout was simple. He had hardly played for East Bengal during the I-League. Whereas the other two  Subhasish Roy Choudhury (Mahindra United) and Arindam Bhattacharya (Churchill Brothers)  played the entire I-League. Paul is a fantastic keeper but his confidence was shattered the way East Bengal treated him. He just needs the confidence and you will see the Subrata Paul we all knew. I dont know but something is wrong with Calcutta football. They almost finished this guy. Best goalkeeper in many years.         
	And Rennedy Singh? We saw him on the right of midfield in the second (substitutes) team. Does this mean his time is up?         
	No. Look, Anthony (Pereira) and Steven Dias do a lot of running. They are young and fresh. The same cannot be expected of Rennedy now. But he is a class with his deliveries. I am seeing whether we can do without a left-footed player in the first eleven. We have some more matches lined up here and then we will decide whether to go with Anthony on the left.         
	How do you see Indian football post Bhaichung?         
	Bhaichung is not just the best Indian player of his generation. He is a leader in every sense. In this team he keeps the harmony among players who come from different parts of the country. He talks to them, tries to find out about their problems and always keeps his cool. He is sensible and very intelligent. When I talk about his replacement I have to think about an excellent footballer and a great personality. It will be difficult.         
	Is that why you backed him in his battle against Mohun Bagan?         
	Look, Bhaichung had every right to feel disgusted. First, you give him permission to participate in a dance programme and then you humiliate him, that too in the media. If I were in Bagans place I would have said no straightaway had Bhaichung come to me with such a request. But had I said yes then I would not have show caused him later. That is double standards.         
	You have been accused of being critical of domestic tournaments like the Santosh Trophy and the Durand Cup         
	The Santosh Trophy or the Durand Cup wont help Indian football. These should be for the amateurs and the second teams of the big clubs. For a good national team India need a strong I-League; I have been saying that since I came here two-and-a-half years back. I have earned many enemies for this but I dont care. My main job is to improve the standard of the game in the country. I can stay here for 40 years and win some Nehru Cups. But that wont serve the purpose. We need clubs to be more in tune with modern thinking.         
	You have a very strong dislike for the way Calcutta clubs function         
	Yes. They dont spend money on youth development. They work like agents. Taking money from the sponsors and spending that on players. No money to develop their own footballers. In a meeting for the Goal 2011 Project they accused me of stealing their players. I asked them how many footballers have your clubs produced. They couldnt answer.         
	Talking about your Goal 2011 Project. Wasnt it too ambitious?         
	First of all it was not my idea. Praful Patel (acting-president, the All India Football Federation) wanted something along those lines. I dont like the idea of keeping a select few for the national team. Too expensive and also there will be logistical problems. It was first mooted two-and-a-half years ago and our research showed that it was not possible. Then (Dempo coach) Armando Colaco talked about it in an I-League coaches meeting and we found that Mahindra would be the worst hit.         
	What was the initial impression when you arrived in India?         
	I came with an open mind. A nation of 1.3 billion and still languishing somewhere near the bottom of the Fifa rankings. And then some days before my first match against Saudi Arabia in Calcutta (August 16, 2006) I had to release eight players for a stupid Calcutta League East Bengal versus Mohun Bagan tie. I was aghast. I understood here I have to be firm. That was the first and the last time Calcutta teams managed to take away players before an international match.         
	Has anything changed in the last three-and-a-half years?         
	Very little. But the I-League players not playing in the local league and both leagues being played on weekends and midweeks is an important step. Otherwise its the same old thing. Players work hard in the national camps and reach a certain level. But they go backwards once they return to the clubs. I am sorry to say that but its true.         
	Which Indian clubs, in your opinion, are the most organised?         
	JCT and Dempo. JCT are producing very good players. Their coach Sukhwinder Singh is a very good man. He is the one who told me about Anwar (Ali). Bob, he is the guy for you, he told me. And thats how I found Anwar.         
	Will we see you after the Asian Cup?         
	At this moment I dont think so. But then you never know. Life is full of surprises.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Irfan shines in Kings win against Royals
                                                     Irfan shines in Kings win against Royals
                  Sangakkara en route to his 60 on Sunday                     
	Cape Town: All-rounder Irfan Pathan struck a valuable 39 and then picked up two crucial wickets to help the Kings XI Punjab to a convincing 27-run victory over the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League here on Sunday.         
	The Kings XI posted a modest 139 for six, thanks to a 51-ball 60 by Kumar Sangakkara and an equally important knock by Irfan, after electing to bat first and then restricted the Rajasthan Royals to 112 for seven in the stipulated 20 overs.         
	Sangakkara hit seven fours and a six, while Irfans innings was studded with a couple of fours and equal number of hits over the rope.         
	Chasing 140 to win, the Rajasthan side lost half their side within seven overs for 36 runs with pacers Irfan (two for 26) and Yusuf Abdulla (three for 21) and leg-spinner Piyush Chawla (two for 22) doing the trick with the ball.         
	Irfan struck twice in his very first over, removing openers  Swapnil Asnodkar (3) and Graeme Smith (2)  to leave the Shane Warne-led side struggling at nine for two in two overs.         
	Abdulla then followed Irfans footsteps and dealt two more severe blows when he had Rob Quiney (7) and Dimitry Mascarenhas (4) back into the pavillion in his second over.         
	Danger-man Yusuf Pathan (10) tried to break the shackles and hammered two fours in the fourth and sixth ball off Irfans second over. But he too perished soon, caught by Karan Goel off Chawla.         
	Ravindra Jadeja (37) and skipper Warne (34) put up a brief resistance with a 60-run partnership, but it wasnt enough for the Rajasthan side.           (PTI)

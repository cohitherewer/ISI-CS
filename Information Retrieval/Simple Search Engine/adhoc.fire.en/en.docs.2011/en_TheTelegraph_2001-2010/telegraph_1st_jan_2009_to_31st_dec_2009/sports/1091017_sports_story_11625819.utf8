The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kalmadi sticks to his guns
                                                   Kalmadi sticks to his guns
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The differences between the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) and the organising committee for the 2010 Delhi Games widened on Friday with chairman Suresh Kalmadi sticking to his guns on the issue of Games CEO Mike Hoopers presence in the capital.         
	To make matters worse, Hooper decided to play to the galleries and launched a blistering attack on the preparation for the Delhi Games.         
	Hours after CGF president Michael Fennell rejected Kalmadis demand to recall Hooper, an unperturbed organising committee chairman initiated yet another campaign against the CEO saying he had no place in India.         
	While work at the organising committee office came to a grinding halt, a defiant Kalmadi said the CGF was free to keep Hooper but maintained that the they dont want him in India.         
	I have never asked for Hoopers sacking. I only sought his transfer. He is the chief executive of the CGF. They are free to keep him, but not in India, Kalmadi said.         
	Lambasting Hooper, Kalmadi said: The organising committee expected Hooper to play the role of an advisor and guide it. I am very unhappy to say that he has offered us little advice. I shall place before Fennell all the details when I meet him in London on October 28 or 29.         
	I will ask Fennell to depute someone who can work with us. That is all.         
	We need someone who guides and encourages us, not confront us at all meetings.         
	Earlier, reacting strongly to Kalmadis statement, Fennell, who has been criticising the Games preparations or the lack thereof over the last few months, said from Jamaica: We are naturally very surprised and disappointed to have received this request to remove Hooper.         
	I have responded to Kalmadis letter and public statements in writing, recording that Hooper enjoys the full support of the CGFs executive board, and that he is an outstanding chief executive and the leader of the CGF management team, Fennell said.         
	Buoyed by the backing of the CGF, Hooper struck back saying the preparations for the Games next year was far from satisfactory.         
	On whether he would say Delhi was not well prepared for the Games, Hooper, who has been asked by the organising committee to operate from his residence, said: Well, I think its the understatement of the year. I mean it very clearly.         
	Hooper has been effectively barred from entering the organising committee office. A senior organising committee official had also asked Hooper not to speak to the media inside their offices.

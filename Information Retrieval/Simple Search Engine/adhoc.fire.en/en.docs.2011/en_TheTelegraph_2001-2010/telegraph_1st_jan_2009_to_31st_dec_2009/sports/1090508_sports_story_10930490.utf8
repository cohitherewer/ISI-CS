                                                   Sacking not on the cards: KKR
                      
	Mumbai: The beleaguered Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) franchise outfit said on Thursday that neither the playing squad nor its support staff will be sacked.         
	Director of cricket operations, John Buchanan, continues to make all decisions in terms of cricket management and KKR does not intend changing squads or support staff, said the media statement from the Shah Rukh Khan-owned team.         
	KKR have won just one match out of the nine they have played so far and are at the bottom of the eight-team table with only three points in their kitty. The statement said the team management, owners as well as the players, still remain resolute in their commitment to the Kolkata Knight Riders and are working hard as a team to overcome challenges they presently face.         
	KKR were looking forward to do better in the remainder of the tournament. (Agencies)

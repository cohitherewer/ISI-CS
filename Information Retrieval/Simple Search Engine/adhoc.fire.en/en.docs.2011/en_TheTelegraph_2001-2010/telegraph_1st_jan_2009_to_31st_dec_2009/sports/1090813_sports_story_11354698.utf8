The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bob still hopeful about Chetri
                                                   Bob still hopeful about Chetri
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                Sunil Chetri    
	Gurgaon: National coach Bob Houghton is still hoping to get injured forward Sunil Chetri fit for the Nehru Cup beginning on August 19.         
	Talking to the media after the national teams practice session at the Devi Lal Stadium here on Wednesday, Houghton said he would take a call on the Dempo strikers fitness after eight days.         
	We are definitely not going to force him if he (Chetri) doesnt recover before the start of the tournament, Houghton said. Sunil Chetri as a footballer is always more important than the Nehru Cup.         
	But then, we will still take a chance with Sunil. It will be a shame if he is not fit for the tournament. He has been in fine form for the last one year. He scored a fine hat-trick in the AFC Challenge Cup final in Delhi. Missing him from the squad will be a disadvantage, said the British coach.         
	Chetri, who has ruptured ligaments on his right leg, was present at the Stadium but did not practice.         
	Houghton, who led India to back to back triumphs in the Nehru Cup 2007 and the AFC Challenge Cup 2008, has reasons to feel disappointed. Sushil Singh, the likely replacement for Chetri, is also recovering from a hamstring injury.         
	An SOS has already been sent to East Bengals Subhas Singh to join the team in Delhi immediately. Houghton also indicated that he could draft in Rahim Nabi in the forwardline.         
	Nabi is playing upfront and Abhishek (Yadav) is in fine form, said the 61-year-old coach. Subhas Singh is very much a part of our scheme of things for the 2011 Asia Cup, he added.         
	The national coach, however, pointed out that he faced similar problems during the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup. Steven Dias was injured at the start of the meet, yet managed to recover and play crucial matches.         
	Houghton was once again upset with facilities at the Devi Lal Stadium and described it as pathetic.         
	 When he was told that the Ambedkar Stadium pitch could also be damaged because of Independence Day celebrations, Houghton said he was disappointed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Top teams keen on Durand
                                                   Top teams keen on Durand
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Bob Houghton may have described the Durand Cup as a stupid and nonsensical tournament but most of the I-League clubs are viewing the 122nd edition of the meet as the testing ground for the major battles ahead.         
	Starting on September 11, barely a fortnight before the I-League gets under way, all top teams, including nine from the I-League, are likely to turn out in full strength for the worlds second oldest tournament.         
	All top teams are keen to play the Durand Cup this time to test their strength before the I-League. It will also be a good place to judge their new foreign recruits, observed a member of the tournament committee.         
	The two Calcutta majors  Mohun Bagan and East Bengal  who did not play the last two editions, are also believed to have shown interest in the Durand Cup. The tournament has lost much of its sheen over the past few years as, almost every season, the dates of the Durand Cup clashed with the national team calendar forcing the teams either to skip the meet or to play with depleted squads.

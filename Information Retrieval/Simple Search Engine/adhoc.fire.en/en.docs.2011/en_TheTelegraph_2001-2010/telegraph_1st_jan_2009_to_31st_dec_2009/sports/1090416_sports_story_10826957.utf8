	Bayern Munich coach Jurgen Klinsmann is taking legal action against a German newspaper after it printed an image of him being crucified on the front page of its Easter edition.         
	The Tageszeitung, said it had received a letter from Klinsmanns lawyer saying the beleaguered coach felt his human dignity deeply and massively violated by the picture, which had been modelled on Monty Pythons Life of Brian.         
	Bayern spokesman Markus Hoerwick said the picture of the crucified Klinsmann under the headline Always Look on the Bright Side of Life was perhaps the worst gaffe ever made by the German media.         
	Klinsmanns lawyer said the damages could amount to 100,000 euros ($132,000) if the case went to court. For its part, the paper said it was relaxed about the legal action. Pressure has been mounting on Klinsmann following disastrous results both in the Bundesliga and the Champions League.         
	Bayern were humiliated 1-5 by Wolfsburg before suffering what was described by Club chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge as a football lesson during a 4-0 drubbing by Barcelona in the first leg of the Champions League quarter final.

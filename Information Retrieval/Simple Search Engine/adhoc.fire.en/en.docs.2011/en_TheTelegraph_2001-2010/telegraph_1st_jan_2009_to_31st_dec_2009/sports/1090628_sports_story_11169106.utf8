                                                     Selectors keen on a wider pool
  - ZIMBABWE off; SL tri-series in September       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Gary Kirsten                                 
	Calcutta: Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Gary Kirsten, the Team India captain and coach, respectively, differed on fatigue having been a factor in our early exit from the World T20, but both have endorsed an informal proposal to widen the selection pool.         
	Injuries, after all, are hitting Team India hard. Not for the first time, but more than just concern is now being shown.         
	Right now, the ODI and T20 squads are basically picked from around 20 players... A few more get added when it comes to Test cricket... Given the long list of international commitments, the pool should be increased to about 30, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	According to the gentleman, an informal proposal was placed before Dhoni and Kirsten in London last week, when the 16-man squad for the ongoing ODIs in the West Indies was selected.         
	Both Dhoni and Kirsten agreed in principle and, now, that has to be taken forward when all the selectors sit down together, the well-placed source added.         
	Chief selector Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Raja Venkat were the only two present in London.         
	In fact, with Yashpal Sharma in the West Indies, all five wont be there even when the committee meets to pick the India A squad for an Emerging meet in Australia.         
	If we exclude Ashish Nehra, who has made a superb comeback after almost four years, and Murali Vijay and Abhishek Nayar, both in an ODI squad for the first time, then the ODI and T20 squads have (in recent times) largely been selected from the following:         
	Sachin Tendulkar (ODIs exclusively), Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Subramaniam Badrinath; Dinesh Karthik, Dhoni; Irfan Pathan, Yusuf Pathan, Ravindra Jadeja; Harbhajan Singh, Pragyan Ojha; Zaheer Khan, Rudra Pratap Singh, Munaf Patel, Ishant Sharma, Praveen Kumar.         
	Where Tests are concerned, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman and Amit Mishra come into the picture. As also Vijay.         
	A total, then, of 24 regulars in all forms.         
	Meanwhile, Zimbabwe wont be hosting a tri-series next month, but Sri Lanka will, in September.         
	The tri-series in Sri Lanka, with India and New Zealand being the visiting nations, will be a build-up to the September 24-October 5 Champions Trophy in South Africa.         
	Dates, though, havent been finalised.         
	Any series involving India fetches millions of dollars through TV rights and sponsorship and, so, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has reason to be mighty pleased.         
	The buzz, of course, is that our participation is the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias way of thanking SLC for supporting its stand on Pakistan vis--vis the 2011 World Cup venues.         
	Incidentally, earlier this year, Dhoni and Co. had been in Sri Lanka for five ODIs and one T20 International.

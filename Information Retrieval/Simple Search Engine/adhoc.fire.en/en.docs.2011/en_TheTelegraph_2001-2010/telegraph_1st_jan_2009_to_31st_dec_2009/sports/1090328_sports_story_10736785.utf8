	Orlando: A final hole bogey denied Jeev Milkha Singh an even-par card and the Indian settled for a one-over 71 to lie tied 41st after the opening round of the $8.5 million Arnold Palmer Invitational golf tournament.         
	Swede of Indian origin Daniel Chopra carded two-under 68 to be tied 10th at the par-70 Bay Hill Club and Lodge.         
	Jason Gore fired a five-under 65 for a one-shot lead over fellow Americans Tim Heron and Jeff Overton who returned identical 66s.         
	Five times champion Tiger Woods fired a two-under-par 68 in the opening round. He mixed five birdies with one bogey and a double-bogey, at the par-five sixth, to end three strokes behind Gore.

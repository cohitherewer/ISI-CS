The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Even Mourinho cant help game here: Bob
                                                     Even Mourinho cant help game here: Bob
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bob Houghton                           
	New Delhi: After four years at the helm of Indian football and, a fair bit of success, Bob Houghton seems a disillusioned man.         
	The 61-year-old British coach, who guided India to victories in the Nehru Cup and the AFC Challenge Cup in the last two seasons, vented his frustration on Thursday saying the game here has not really gone forward in the last four years.         
	So upset was he that Houghton even went to the extent of condemning union sports minister M.S. Gill for saying that the national team can be beaten by an Australian school team.         
	He (Gill) should ask himself rather than being cynical, said Houghton. Instead of criticising the team, why doesnt he create some training facilities for the national team, the coach asked.         
	I know my quotes are going to make big sensational headlines, but that is not going to solve the problems. They can ask the coach to pack his bag immediately. I am ready for that I really dont care. But even if you bring (Jose) Mourinho, things are not going to be any better, said Houghton.         
	Houghton said he couldnt find even a single venue with proper training facilities for the national team.         
	Last time, we practised in Gurgaon. Everyday after 5.30 pm, different groups of boys would swarm the pitch for cricket practice and even for throwing javelin. Have you ever heard an international football side in any part of the world training under such circumstances? he asked.         
	If with such facilities we are number 140 (in Fifa rankings) then we are doing well, I should say, Houghton added.         
	Houghton, who steered India to the final rounds of the Asia Cup for the first time in 24 years, said the outlook had to be changed to compete at the highest level.         
	So much importance is still being given to stupid and nonsensical tournaments like the Santosh Trophy, IFA Shield and the Durand Cup. Climax Lawrence rushed to Chennai to play in the Santosh Trophy within days of the AFC Cup match in Dubai. I cannot imagine Steven Gerrard playing for an obscure and amateur Lancashire side in the off season, commented the coach.         
	Either you want a highly professionally organised national team or you go down the road and play competition which have no value or quality.         
	If you follow that road then dont ask why India is 140 in the ranking, dont ask why India cant qualify for international tournaments, he said.         
	Houghton even questioned the organisation of the I-League. We also need to look at the quality of the I-League. I dont think any of the I-League clubs follow the criteria needed for a professional league. Most teams dont have doctors, trainers, assistant coaches, physios, goalkeeping coaches and, most importantly, a training ground, he said.         
	The only positive, Houghton said, was an exciting bunch of players and, of course, the success that the team had tasted in the last couple of years.         
	That keeps me motivated. Otherwise, I would have left long ago, said the coach.         
	The national team will leave on June 25 for a 10-day training camp in Dubai. Thereafter they will move to Barcelona on July 7 for a month of training as part of their preparation for the Nehru Cup, to be held in August.

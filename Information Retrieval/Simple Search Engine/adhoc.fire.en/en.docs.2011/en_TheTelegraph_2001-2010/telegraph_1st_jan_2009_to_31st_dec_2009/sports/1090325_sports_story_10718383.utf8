	Napier: New Zealand coach Andy Moles is quite unhappy that his bowlers would not be getting a seaming track on which they could bowl out India twice in the second Test, beginning Thursday at the McLean Park here.         
	Much to his chagrin, the surface had been moved two to three feet and now includes half the original pitch and half of the adjacent one, which was used for the one-day game between the two sides earlier this month.         
	We need a typical New Zealand wicket where it nips for about a couple of days so it brings our seamers into the game against their batting attack which is used to the ball being true and turning a bit, Moles said.         
	He had sought to checkmate the rampant Indian batsmen with sideways movement.         
	If the wicket is very dry it can turn a lot, which is obviously something we dont want to experience down there, rued Moles.         
	New Zealand Cricket (NZC) on Tuesday dismissed the concerns about McLean Park wicket, saying the strip, which developed some fungal growth, is in excellent condition.         
	The NZC clarified that any disease did not affect the pitch.         
	The Test playing strip is slightly to one side of the strip originally scheduled to be used for the match, which was affected by minor patches after reseeding following the West Indies series. The patches are purely cosmetic and not the result of disease.         
	The new strip appears hard and flat, with affected areas well outside the playing zone. The strip has been extensively prepared over the past 10 days and is in excellent condition, NZC said in a statement.         
	But both Daniel Vettori and Mahendra Singh Dhoni will have the condition of this wicket, which had produced close to 600 runs in the first ODI three weeks ago, on their mind before they choose to bat or bowl. A victory for India would give them an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match rubber and a series victory, last achieved in 1967-68 by Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi.

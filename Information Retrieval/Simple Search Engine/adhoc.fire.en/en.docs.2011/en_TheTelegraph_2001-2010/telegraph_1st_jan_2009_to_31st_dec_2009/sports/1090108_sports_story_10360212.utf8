                                                   Super 22 on City owners mind
            RORY SMITH                      
	Manchester Citys billionaire backers want to build a super-squad boasting of world-class stars battling for every position.         
	While Eastlands manager Mark Hughes is spending this month trying to plot a way out of a relegation battle with less glamorous acquisitions, the clubs owner, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, has a very different long-term vision for his side.         
	The oil tycoon believes if City are to topple the likes of Manchester United, Chelsea and Barcelona to triumph on a domestic and European scale, the club must boast of a squad of 22 of the biggest talents in world football. The belief of the clubs powerbrokers is that such strength in depth is the only way to ensure competition for places and guarantee success.         
	City stunned the football world when they stole a march on Chelsea to land Brazilian Robinho for a British record  32million on transfer deadline day in August. The former Real Madrid strikers success since arriving in Manchester bears testament to the wisdom of splashing out on proven quality.         
	More signings of his calibre are likely to follow as Sheikh Mansour attempts to fulfil his dream of making City a global brand and a footballing force.         
	A club source said: Theres a consensus among the owners and the manager that success is inevitably going to involve having depth of talent  two players competing for every position.         
	In the corridors of the City of Manchester Stadium, however, it is acknowledged that such headline-grabbing transfers will have to wait until the summer at the earliest.         
	While Hughes has been consistently linked with mid-season moves for the games biggest names, because of the impracticalities of working in the January window, the club believe, first and foremost, the former Blackburn manager must fill the gaping holes in his squad.         
	The likes of Chelseas John Terry, Milan playmaker Kaka and Valencia striker David Villa will be targeted when the club have more time to assess their options, although the club will only bring in players who fit into the sheikhs long-term battle plan.         
	A list of potential targets for each position has already been drawn up in consultation with Hughes, who retains the full backing of the clubs board.         
	Insiders admit the season so far has been something of a roller-coaster but believe the sheikh is prepared to be patient, accepting that Hughes is working with an unbalanced squad.         
	Hughes stated his belief last weekend that January is a difficult window to work in and such caution has spread to the clubs entire transfer policy. The sheikh and his advisers accept that, even with almost unlimited transfer funds, some players will be unobtainable.         
	The list of targets contains several alternatives for each position. Sources insist there is a Plan B, and a Plan C, for every place in the squad.         
	The Daily Telegraph

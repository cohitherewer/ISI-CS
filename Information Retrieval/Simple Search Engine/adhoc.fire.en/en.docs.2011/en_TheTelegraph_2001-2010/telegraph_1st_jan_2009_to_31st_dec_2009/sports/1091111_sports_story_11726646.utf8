The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger left stunned
                                                                                                                                   Tiger left stunned
                      
	Melbourne: Tiger Woods was left stunned by the rapturous welcome from the Australian fans and media Tuesday, ahead of his first tournament appearance Down Under for 11 years.         
	Thousands of fans turned out to watch Woods practice at the Kingston Heath course here in the lead-up to Thursdays European Tour co-sanctioned Australian Masters, while television helicopters recorded his every move.         
	No, its not normal. Trust me, its not. Thank God, its not normal, Woods said reacting to the reception he had received in Australia.         
	You dont normally see this many people at a practice round maybe at a Major you might see this many people.         
	Ive never experienced the helicopters before, they were overhead but they didnt interfere with my play.         
	Tournament organisers paid a reported $3 million to lure the 14-time Major winner to Melbourne, and the investment appears to have already paid off.         
	Huge galleries, not seen since the heyday of Greg Norman in the 1980s, are expected to follow Woods this week and media interest has been intense, giving Australian golf a much-needed fillip.         
	Such is the craze to see Woods play this week that all 25,000 tickets for each of the four days were snapped up early last month.         
	Woods, 33, has yet to win a tournament in Australia, but he has not played here since the 1998 Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne, and he expressed genuine enthusiasm about being back.         
	Its an unbelievable golf course, we dont get a chance to play at venues like this and it is truly a treat to play the (Melbourne) sandbelt golf courses, the bunkering is just phenomenal, Woods said.         
	You would never get a chance to see bunkering like this in any other place in the world. I just love coming down here, Woods added.         
	Woods was tied for the eighth spot when he last played in the Masters, at nearby Huntingdale, in 1997.         
	He comes into the Australian Masters after finishing tied sixth behind American world No.2 Phil Mickelson at the World Golf Championships in Shanghai last weekend.         
	With all the focus on the appearance of golfs billion-dollar man, a host of leading Australian golfers who are in Melbourne have been relegated to supporting acts.         
	Members of Australias elite who will seek to steal Woods thunder this week include Geoff Ogilvy, ranked No.12 in the world, Michael Sim (No.59), Adam Scott (No.62), Mathew Goggin (No.69) and defending champion Rod Pampling (No.102).         
	Part of the Australian organisers strategy was to cap ticket prices at 44 Australian dollars ($40) per round, principally because Woodss appearance has been largely subsidised by taxpayer money.

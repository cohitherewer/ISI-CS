The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Frankly, its not a nice time to be in Pakistan
                                                   Frankly, its not a nice time to be in Pakistan
                                          GUEST COLUMN    Ramiz Raja      
	I was on my way to the ground for commentary and noticed a lot of activity on the approach to the Gaddafi. Not in my worst nightmares had I thought such a barbaric act  targeting cricketers  could happen in my Lahore. It was when I heard sirens blaring and saw ambulances whizzing past that I knew something was terribly wrong. Just then a call from our television producer confirmed my worst fears.         
	The Sri Lanka team bus has been attacked, he said.         
	I couldnt believe my ears. The producers voice kept echoing as I tried to come to terms with the shocking news.         
	As I write this column for you, eight hours have passed, but its yet to sink in.         
	We, in Pakistan, were all convinced that sport would never be targeted by terrorists, and yet it has happened. Its very unfortunate.         
	At the same time, lets not forget the deeds of bravery that saved a lot of lives. The driver of the match referee and umpires vehicle sacrificed his own life to protect his guests. They were in the same convoy and just behind the Sri Lanka team bus.         
	Cricket in Pakistan needed a lift and captain Younis Khan had provided the perfect platform with a fantastic triple century in the opening Test of the series, in Karachi. It provided the perfect fillip to the game. There was a lot of hope and passion and Pakistan cricket was again being talked about in all quarters.         
	Tuesdays incident will, however, change it all.         
	We really dont know how to deal with this. We had got accustomed to the ways of terrorism but this was something out of the blue. The entire nation is wearing a gloom. The streets are deserted and all are glued to their TV screens. Frankly, its not a nice time to be in Pakistan.         
	We have recovered from tragedies but the ongoing nightmare doesnt seem to end. The future doesnt look too bright. We know, though, that time is the best healer and are hoping and waiting for a miracle. However, there doesnt seem to be a way out in the next 12 months.         
	I know the focus will immediately shift to the 2011 World Cup and Pakistan as co-hosts. I appeal to the cricketing fraternity to give us some time to get over this.         
	At this moment, it will be very difficult for the world to understand that cricket can again be played in Pakistan. But things can change. Only recently our government signed a peace pact with the militants in Swat.         
	Hopefully, there will be no knee-jerk reaction. But, yes, things do need to improve drastically in the coming months.         
	The fans in Pakistan need comfort and consoling. We need to have the Asian bloc, particularly India, and the world body with us. Another strong response will lead to disastrous consequences.         
	Its a difficult call for Pakistan cricket and we need help from all quarters. The world needs to come to our rescue. Its easy to punch us out of the cricketing world, but that would be no solution. Lets not forget we are an important player in world cricket. We may not be among the top teams right now, but you cannot forget Pakistan cricket completely.         
	At this point in time, lets not play politics with Pakistan cricket. It needs guidance to be lifted out of this gloom. The cricketing fraternity, particularly India, needs to play the big brothers role. Its easy to condemn Pakistan cricket for circumstances which arent in our control.         
	If cricket doesnt happen in Pakistan, it will have a negative effect and will kill the passion of the future generation of players. Thankfully, the next series in Pakistan is nine-ten months away and we will have to play abroad during this period.         
	We should try to motivate civil society and get everybody on a common platform to save the game. In tragedy, nations come together, and all should join hands to rally against the fundamentalists.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | What the EPL will miss...
                                                   What the EPL will miss...
                      
	Cristiano Ronaldo: Real Madrid would be hoping that Fergusons talismanic winger becomes their lucky charm. A void United might find hard to fill.         
	Xabi Alonso: Real again. The search was for a conductor whod hold the game together and help the Spanish giants orchestra stay on song. Steal for Real, loss for Liverpool.         
	Alvaro Arbeloa: What Real like they get. The right back who can move up and fall back with ease. A setback but not one that the Reds cant overcome.         
	And         
	St James Park: An iconic address. The Magpies wings have been clipped but legions of Newcastles diehard fans believe in their hearts that the phoenix will rise from the ashes.

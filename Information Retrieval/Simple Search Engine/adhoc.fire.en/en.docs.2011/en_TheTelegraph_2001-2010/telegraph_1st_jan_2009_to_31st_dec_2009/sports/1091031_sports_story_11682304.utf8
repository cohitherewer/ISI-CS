                                                     Ponting: Got to do better
  - THIRD ODI Australia captain hopes for greater impact from pacers       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja during a practice session at the Kotla on Friday. (AFP)                                       
	New Delhi: Defeat in the Nagpur ODI is not going to affect the performance of the Australians in Delhi, skipper Ricky Ponting claimed Friday. According to him, the team will turn around and the home side will not be able to take advantage of the momentum gained in the second match.         
	I am not a big believer in momentum, he said. Things turn around too quickly in a match. We have lost a few players through injuries and weve got to do better than Nagpur.               
	The following are excerpts               
	The Kotla wicket         
	It will be harder to score and the total will be lower than the first two matches, whichever team adapts better will win. We have an option of playing two spinners tomorrow (Saturday). Jon Holland is around but we will also see what other options we have.         
	Spin factor         
	It will spin quite a bit and there will be little margin for error. We anticipate the wicket to be like it was during the Champions League T20. (Nathan) Hauritz can do the job for us and, hopefully, we will have more impact from the pacers.         
	Sourav Gangulys advice to bat first         
	(Laughs) Let me win the toss first and then we will see Well, I am also looking forward to batting first. So, thanks Sourav.         
	On Mitchell Johnson         
	He is a genuine all-rounder. He has definitely got the potential to be a good all-rounder in all three formats of the game. His batting has come up a lot in Tests and we are not worried about his bowling. He is the international Cricketer of the Year. More he plays the better.         
	Bowling at death         
	We didnt have Brett Lee in Nagpur. He is the guy who has been bowling at death for us. We tried different guys in the last match. With Dhoni there, you always concede extra runs. You know how dangerous he is. But we have identified the areas and are working on it.         
	India gaining momentum         
	I am not a big believer in momentum. Things turn around too quickly in a match. We have lost a few players through injuries and weve got to do better than Nagpur. But then, it is one thing to talk about and another to do it under pressure.         
	Moises Henriquess role         
	He is not yet in the side but we havent finalised the playing eleven. But it is a big step forward for him to rise in international cricket. Teams keep changing and it is a great opportunity for the youngster.         
	Wicketkeeper Graham Manou         
	He has got some experience after having played a few internationals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No independent review done
                                                     No independent review done
    - ICC WENT BY WHAT THE PAKISTAN CRICKET BOARD HAD TO OFFER           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI    
	Calcutta: Despite what chief executive Haroon Lorgat had said in Mohali, during the India-England Test last December, the International Cricket Council (ICC) made no independent assessment of security in Pakistan before assigning match officials for the recent tours by Sri Lanka.         
	Mahela Jayawardene and Co. played three ODIs in January and, then, returned in February for the two-Test series which ended with a helicopter evacuation from the Gaddafi on Tuesday afternoon.         
	While Englishman Chris Broad was the Match Referee on both occasions, Nigel Llong (England) was the overseas umpire on duty during the ODIs, with Australians Simon Taufel and Steve Davis there for the Tests.         
	Sri Lankas Peter Manuel too was present in his official capacity  ICCs regional umpires performance manager.         
	Among others, then, Broad, Taufel, Davis and Manuel had a narrow escape when terrorists struck, off the Gaddafi, on Tuesday morning.         
	The ambush took eight lives, though.         
	Getting back to Lorgat, hed declared: Well do an independent assessment of the situation there (Pakistan), for the safety of the match officials. After all, we would be appointing them         
	On Saturday, however, an ICC spokesman confirmed that just hadnt been done.         
	A standard protocol is in place and its the home Boards responsibility to arrange for security A copy of the arrangements is forwarded to the ICC The same was followed for the tours to Pakistan by Sri Lanka.         
	Initially, our match officials did have some queries, which were routed to the home Board Once the answers came, they were forwarded to the gentlemen concerned, who didnt express reservations over going to Pakistan The match officials were satisfied, the spokesman told The Telegraph from Dubai.         
	Thats correct, but because of an unsettled environment in Pakistan, the ICC should still have initiated an independent security assessment. It needed to be flexible, instead of strictly going by the book.         
	After all, the Champions Trophy (which was to have been held last September) ran into rough weather, all because of concerns over security, and the Indian government didnt allow the Mahendra Singh Dhonis to tour Pakistan from the first week of January.         
	That, again, had been a security-driven decision.

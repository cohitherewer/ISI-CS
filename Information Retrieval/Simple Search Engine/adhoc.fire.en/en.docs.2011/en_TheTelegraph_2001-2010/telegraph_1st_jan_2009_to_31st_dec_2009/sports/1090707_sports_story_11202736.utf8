            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A second-round loss at Wimbledon cost Sania Mirza seven places in the Womens Tennis Association (WTA) singles ranking released on Monday, as the Indian slipped to 85 but maintained her 37th position in the doubles list.         
	A failed bid at Wimbledon also affected Somdev Dev Varmans and Prakash Amritrajs rankings as the former lost three places to be 132 and the latter went down by five spots to be at 159 in the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) ranking list.         
	Mahesh Bhupathi gained a place to be at eighth in the mens doubles ranking courtesy a semi-final appearance at the All England Club. Leander Paes maintained his sixth position despite making a shock first round exit there.         
	Roger Federers historic feat on Sunday helped him reclaim the top spot in the ATP rankings list. The womens top ten remained unchanged.

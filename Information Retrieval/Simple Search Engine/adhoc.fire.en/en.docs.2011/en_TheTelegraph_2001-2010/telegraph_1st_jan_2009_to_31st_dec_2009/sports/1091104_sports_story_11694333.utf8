The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bangladesh take series
                                                                                                                                   Bangladesh take series
                      
	Chittagong: Raqibul Hassan hit a giant six to bring up the winning runs as Bangladesh completed a series-clinching six-wicket victory Tuesday after skittling Zimbabwe out for 44, the fifth-lowest total ever in an ODI.         
	Bangladesh raced to 49 for four in 11.5 overs to secure an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match series after the fourth match wound up in less than 37 overs.         
	Shakib-al Hasan said a moist pitch meant Bangladesh had to work harder than expected to chase down the total.         
	It was not what we had expected, the wicket was not ideal for one-day matches, Shakib said. We would have loved to have won by 10 wickets, but it was spinning a lot.         
	He also said the result could have been even more lopsided had his fielders not put down three chances. We have been dropping some catches, we need to work a bit on our fielding, Shakib added.         
	After winning the toss and electing to bat, Zimbabwe lost their first four wickets for just eight runs at the Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium.         
	Enamul Haque and Shakib took three wickets apiece for the hosts as only Malcolm Waller (13) and Stuart Matsikenyeri (11) reached double figures for Zimbabwe.         
	Spinners Raymond Price and Graeme Cremer claimed two wickets each before Bangladesh completed the chase.         
	Bangladesh were always in command, and lost the first two wickets on 33. Price finished with two for five, with Cremer taking two for 11.         
	Price first dismissed opener Tamim Iqbal (22), and then trapped Mohammed Ashraful lbw for a duck.

	Siem Reap (Cambodia): Shiv Kapur jumped into title contention after a sparking second round card of five-under 67 that not only sent him soaring to second spot in Johnnie Walker Cambodian Open but also brightened his chances of salvaging an Asian Tour card for next season.         
	Currently in 69th position on the Asian Tour Order of Merit, Kapur gave himself a huge boost of retaining his Tour card when he charged into contention with a superb 67.         
	He made the turn in 35 before adding a birdie on the 10th hole and closing strongly with three consecutive birdies, including a 20-footer at his last, even though he felt it could have been better.         
	Kapur, who needs to finish in the top-65 to keep his full playing rights on the Asian Tour.         
	Gunning for his maiden Asian Tour title, Welshman Craig Smith fired six-under 66 to total nine-under 135 and open up a two-stroke lead over Shiv Kapur, Annop Tangkamolprasert (69) and Artemio Murakami (69) who share the second spot in the $300,000 full field Asian Tour event.         
	Among other Indians in the fray, Vikrant Chopra (140) carded one-under 71 to lie tied 13th and stay in hunt for a top 10 finish. One shot behind at tied 15th was rising star Anirban Lahiri, having returned an identical 71 in the second round.         
	City pro Rahil Gangjee (142) was at tied 23rd after carding 72, while Amandeep Johl (145) was tied 48th after carding a similar even-par round. Amateur Rashid Khan (147) went for 74 to miss the cut by two strokes. (PTI)

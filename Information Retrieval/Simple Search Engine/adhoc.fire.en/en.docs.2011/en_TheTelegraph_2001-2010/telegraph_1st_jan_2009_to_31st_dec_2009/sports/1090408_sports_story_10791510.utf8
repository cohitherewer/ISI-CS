                                                     Have set benchmark: Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT            Mahendra Singh Dhoni in Wellington on Tuesday. (AFP)   Related reports, scorecard, stats: Page 14                                 
	Wellington: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni Tuesday defended the timing of his declaration, saying 110-120 overs would have been enough for his team to win the match and there was no need to change his plan just because of rain prediction.         
	India created history by recording their first series win in New Zealand after 41 years though rain denied them a deserving victory in the third Test. As rain played spoilsport in Indias push for a 2-0 series win on the fifth and final day, the hosts escaped with a draw after they were down to 281 for eight chasing a near impossible 617.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The tour         
	It has been good, from the very first game that we played. We lost the first couple of Twenty20 games, and then won the one-day and Test series. We have improved a lot, we have put in lot of effort. We wanted to improve in specific areas, which we have. A good learning curve for us, good exposure for some of the youngsters in the side. Overall, a very pleasing tour.         
	Not winning this Test         
	Of course a bit disappointing not to win this Test.         
	The significance of the series victory         
	We have set the benchmark. Next time when we come to New Zealand, people will expect you to win. You have achieved something thats big, but the tough part is to maintain it, to sustain it. It never gets easy for a cricketer. If you have not achieved something, theres pressure on you to achieve it. Once you have achieved it, there is pressure to sustain it. Nothing comes easy, it will be tougher for the guys who come on the next tour. Its all about enjoying cricket, giving your best and not thinking about the result.         
	The overall performance         
	Overall, a very good team effort. Contributions came when they were needed. Wickets were on the flatter side, there wasnt much in it for the bowlers, so they have to keep on changing their plans and improvising at times. The same applied with the batsmen also. Overall, the effort by the bowlers was really great and the lower-order contribution is very important because that takes the morale of the team really up. Whenever it was really needed from them, the lower-order contributed. We didnt rely on one specific individual, everybody contributed. Each and every batsman scored at some point in the series and the same applies to the bowlers also. At times, there was one end which was not favouring the seamers, maybe because of the wind or not much help from the wicket Still, bowling your heart out from that end, you really need quite a determined body and mind to do that. Quite happy with the performance overall.         
	Gautam Gambhir and Zaheer Khans performance         
	Both of them, they keep on improving. Each and every game that they play they look to improve. They raise the bar wherever they are performing. All the batsmen, whenever they are set, they want to get a big score for the side. Its not only about getting 50s and 100s, if needed they can go beyond that. Zak has been brilliant in the last one-and-a-half to two years. He has bowled well everywhere. He always comes up with a few plans of his, he executes those plans and he helps the other bowlers. It has been fantastic to see the way he has bowled throughout the series, whether the wicket was helping him or there was no help for him.         
	Harbhajan Singhs bowling         
	It was very difficult, the wind increased in the last couple of days. Munaf did well to bowl a few overs from the far end. Bhajji took over. Its difficult for a spinner to bowl against the breeze. Batsmen can look to take you on, even a mis-hit can carry over the boundary. But he used the breeze to have a bigger impact on the game. He was drifting the ball both ways and thats what is important. You want to beat the batsman in flight and thats what he did.         
	Sachin Tendulkars bowling Tuesday         
	Thats what is great about Sachin Tendulkar. Its not like he just contributes with the bat or with the ideas that he has got. He can contribute as a bowler. Of late, we have not seen him bowl much but this was an occasion where he said I want to bowl. He made the most of it, he was mixing the deliveries well, he was flighting the ball, using the googlies to a good extent and confusing the batsmen. So that really helped, it set up that momentum where we were looking to win the game.         
	The wickets this time         
	I reckon it depends on what you think is a good Test wicket. If you think 2003 was a good Test wicket, then this was not a good Test wicket!         
	The positives         
	Its not about what you are getting out of the series, it is about how much effort you are putting in and what you wanted to achieve. Of course, 3-0 is what you look forward for because there is nothing beyond that. But its not about that.         
	The gains         
	What we are also doing well is our planning and our practice. Every practice session is like a match for us. Practice environment is very good, very competitive. We think about giving our 100 per cent, not about the result.         
	If an early declaration was needed         
	You cant really bank on the weather. What we were expecting was a minimum of 110 overs. But we didnt even get that much. It is also about the mindset. When you have that extra 80-odd runs on the board, you can have that extra catching fielders hanging around for a longer duration of time What we wanted to do in the second innings was to attack, attack and attack so that even if one ball goes in the air, you have a fielder to catch it. Thats only possible when you have that extra 70-80 runs. You dont want to change your plan, whatever position you are in. With two days of play, we knew it may rain, but at that point of time, it was not certain. With the amount of wind that goes around, there was a very good chance that the clouds would have been blown away. We thought we would get them out.         
	The time spent in New Zealand         
	I did plenty of things  fishing, sightseeing. I didnt go for bungy jumping and sky diving and all that, its scary. But I did spend a fair amount of time on fishing. Overall, good 50-odd days of cricket and off the field we had plenty to do.

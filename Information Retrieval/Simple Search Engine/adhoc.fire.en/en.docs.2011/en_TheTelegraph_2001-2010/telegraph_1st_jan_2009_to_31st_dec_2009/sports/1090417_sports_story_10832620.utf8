                                                   SA recall Morne for fifth ODI

	Calcutta: South Africa Thursday brought back pace duo of Morne Morkel and Makhaya Ntini in their team for Fridays fifth and final ODI against Australia, dropping off-spinner Johan Botha and fast bowler Wayne Parnell.         
	Botha was reported for suspect bowling action during the fourth match of the series, which the hosts have already won by 3-1.         
	According to captain Graeme Smith, the teams success against the formidable Australians and earlier against England is most satisfying.         
	Australia captain Ricky Ponting said that he would like to end on a winning note, even though the series is already lost with his team trailing 3-1.

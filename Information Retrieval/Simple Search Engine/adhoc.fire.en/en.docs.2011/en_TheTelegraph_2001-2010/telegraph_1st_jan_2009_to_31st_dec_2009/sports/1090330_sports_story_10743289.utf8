The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahesh, Mark out 
                                                   Mahesh, Mark out 
                      
	Miami (Florida): Mahesh Bhupathi and his Bahamian partner Mark Knowles made a shocking first round exit from the Sony Ericsson Open after losing to the unseeded French combine of Julien Benneteau and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga here.         
	Third-seeded Bhupathi and Knowles squandered a one-set lead to go down 6-3, 5-7, 6-10.         
	Meanwhile, No. 3 seed Jelena Jankovic suffered a shock second round exit after losing 4-6, 6-7 to Argentine Gisela Dulko. World No. 1s Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal eased through and the surprise came in the final game of the round.         
	Nadals game was preceded by a flamenco dancer on the stadium court, but there was little need for fancy footwork from the Spaniard as he enjoyed a 6-2, 6-2 win over Russian Teimuraz Gabashvili.         
	The Spaniard will now face Portugals Frederico Gil in the next round.         
	Williams, searching for her sixth win at Key Biscayne, did not sparkle but still had little trouble in her 6-2, 6-3 victory over compatriot Alexa Glatch.         
	Having dealt with the 19-year-old Californian, a wildcard entry, Williams will now play Chinas Peng Shuai, seeded 32nd, who beat Italian Mara Santangelo 7-5, 6-3.         
	Venus got off to a slow start but found her form to defeat spirited Israeli Shahar Peer 6-3, 6-3 and ensure a meeting with German Anna-Lena Groenefeld in the next round.         
	In the mens event, fourth seed Andy Murray of Britain had to graft for his 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 win over Argentine Juan Monaco. He will play Chiles Nicolas Massu, a three-set victor over American Mardy Fish, in the next round.

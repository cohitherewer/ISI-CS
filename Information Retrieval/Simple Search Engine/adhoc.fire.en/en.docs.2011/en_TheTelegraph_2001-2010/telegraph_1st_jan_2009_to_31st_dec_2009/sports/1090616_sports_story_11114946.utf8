	However, Sania conceded her first round singles match of the qualifying event of the $60,000 Aegon International in Eastbourne after a hip strain on Sunday against Alexandra Dulgheru of Romania. Sania was trailing 4-6, 2-3. She will play the doubles though.         
	There were no changes in the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) mens doubles rankings as Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi retained the fifth and ninth spots respectively. Somdev Dev Varmans singles rank remained static at 132.         
	Meanwhile, the top 10 rankings in the ATP and WTA lists remained unchanged.

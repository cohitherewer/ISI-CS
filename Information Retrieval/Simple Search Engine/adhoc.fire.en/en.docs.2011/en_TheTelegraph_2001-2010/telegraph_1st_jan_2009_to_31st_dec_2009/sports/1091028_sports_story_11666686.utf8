The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhattacharya praises striker
                                                   Bhattacharya praises striker
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Chirag United coach Subrata Bhattacharya on Tuesday thanked Brazilian import Joshimar for enabling the team hold Mahindra United to a 2-2 draw on Tuesday.         
	I wouldnt say we played a good match, but we fought well. Joshimar was effective and did his job. He earned this point for us, Bhattacharya said.         
	Bhattacharya admitted that the team must improve their defense if they wished to hold on to the top spot in the league table.         
	We made some defensive mistakes. That has to be rectified in the next five days (before travelling to Goa to play against Sporting Clube de Goa), the coach said.         
	Bhattacharyas counterpart David Booth too had some worries on the defense front. We are not defending properly at the right time, the Englishman said.         
	If you ask what we would like to leave behind from this game, the answer would be goals at crucial times. We have lost four points in two games now because of that, he said.         
	Booth believed Mohammed Rafis third goal should have been allowed. Rafi dived (to make contact with the ball) from behind the defender. I dont how it can be off-side. I would like to see the video of that goal, he said.

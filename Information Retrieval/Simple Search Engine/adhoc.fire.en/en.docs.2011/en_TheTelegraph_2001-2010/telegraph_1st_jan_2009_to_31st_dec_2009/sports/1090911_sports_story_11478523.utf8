                                                     Dhoni: We will miss Gambhir

	Colombo: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni Thursday conceded the team will miss Gautam Gambhir and revealed Dinesh Karthik will don the openers role in the ongoing Compaq Cup tri-series here.         
	Gambhir will return home without playing a single match owing to a groin injury, which would mean India would miss both their regular openers since Virender Sehwag is also out of action following a shoulder surgery. Dhoni said Karthik would open the innings along with Sachin Tendulkar.         
	Dinesh Karthik will open tomorrow (Friday) because he is doing well in the net sessions, and also because we do not have a replacement right now, Dhoni said on the eve of Indias tournament opener. Dinesh has done that job in the West Indies and has done well for us in Tests also. Definitely he will open tomorrow (Friday).         
	Best opener Sachin Tendulkar is also there, he added.         
	Dhoni said Gambhir picked up the injury during the Sahara BCCI Corporate Trophy, but nothing could be done about that.         
	I think it was during the corporate tournament (that he picked up the injury), if I am not wrong. But I think in the batting session it got aggravated, Dhoni said.         
	So that is a big blow of course as he has really done well for us in the past one-and-half years, he said.         
	You can take precautions against injury. You can train yourself not to get injured. But once you get an injury you cannot do much about it. So we are expecting he gets fit before the Champions Trophy and that we have a replacement, Dhoni said.         
	Of course well miss Gautam Gambhir but nothing can be done about it. It is for the player who replaces him and takes up the responsibility, Dhoni added.         
	While Gambhirs absence would mean extra responsibility for Tendulkar, pressure would be on comeback man Rahul Dravid as well, and Dhoni said the former India captain would bat at No.3 in normal circumstances.         
	Rahul Dravid is an ideal batsman for No.3, particularly in these conditions and if we bat in the evening, it would be a very demanding situation, Dhoni said. Dravid is one batsman who has proved that you need him when the ball moves or seams, he said.         
	If the overs are cut short because of rains and if we need to accelerate, then well reshuffle the order. We have done this in the past by not resorting to one fixed batting order but under normal circumstances, Rahul will bat at No.3, the captain said.         
	Interestingly, Dhoni made it clear that though selectors are rushing in Virat Kohli as Gambhirs replacement, he would persist with Karthik as opener.         
	Well see how Dinesh does in the series. I think it is unfair to give an individual just one game to prove himself, Dhoni said. Personally, I feel Virat Kohli is not an opening batsman. Last time when we came here, Sehwag got injured during a practice session and Virat had to open and he did very well for us. But it is unfair to push a newcomer for the role.         
	I would prefer Dinesh to open and give an opportunity to Virat Kohli where he fits and he has most chances of performing. This is a very short series, he said.         
	India would become the No.1 ODI team if Dhonis men win the title, but the stumper was not ready to let it become a distraction. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Thats the way I bat: Chirag
                                                                                                                       7                                      Thats the way I bat: Chirag
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Chirag Pathak set the Eden on fire, taking 19 runs off Ranadeb Bose in the first over of the match. Saurashtra ensured that momentum was not lost through the day.         
	That is the way I bat. If theres something to hit, I will go for it even if it is the first ball of the day, said the left-hander. Chirag, incidentally, had taken 22 runs off Zaheer Khans first over in the Ranji semi-final against Mumbai, in Chennai last year.         
	Chirag and Sagar Jogyani put on 206 runs in an opening stand. Were aiming for something around 550. We can then put some pressure on them, Jogyani said.         
	There was some movement in the morning session We needed to bat aggressively to counter it, said Chirag. The way we batted upset their plans.         
	Jogyani added: We played according to the situation the aim was to play session by session.         
	For the record, Chirag had attended the Kolkata Knight Riders trials in Ahmedabad last season but failed to make the cut.

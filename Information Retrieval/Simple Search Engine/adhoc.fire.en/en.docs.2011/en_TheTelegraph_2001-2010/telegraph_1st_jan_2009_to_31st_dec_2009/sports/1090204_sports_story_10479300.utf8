                                                       CA bars Symonds selection for SA
            A STAFF REPORTER            Andrew Symonds                           
	Calcutta: Cricket Australia (CA) has advised its national selection panel (NSP) not to consider Andrew Symonds for national selection until he has completed further counselling and rehabilitation, according to information forwarded by CA.         
	CA chief executive officer James Sutherland Tuesday announced that Symonds will be unavailable for selection for the South Africa tour this month and will need to satisfy formal rehabilitation criteria before again being made available for international selection.         
	Sutherland said CA had re-assessed Symonds progress with his rehabilitation after the player was fined $4000 for a code of behaviour breach relating to detrimental public comment late last month.         
	Our assessment is that he is making good progress but that his commitment needs testing against new, tougher criteria we will finalise after consultation with his counsellors, the ACA and Queensland Cricket, he said.         
	We have a responsibility to Andrew and his welfare but we also have a responsibility to Australian cricket to ensure his commitment is as it needs to be, before he can be considered for national selection.         
	In making the decision, Sutherland noted feedback from the state, national players and Australian team management supporting that Symonds was making good progress with the rehabilitation programme he is undertaking. Sutherland said he had advised Andrew Symonds of the decision.         
	The rehabilitation criteria are likely to include the following:         
	Symonds would review and reaffirm his personal documented commitments.         
	The counselling programme would increase in concentration and be treated as a priority above Symonds CA and QC commitments.         
	Formal fortnightly rehabilitation progress reports would be sent to CA.         
	Sutherland said CA would review Symonds progress at the end of the Sheffield Shield season, which is prior to the NSP selection of its squad for the Australia-Pakistan ODI series to be played from April.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nandy looks for strikers
                                                   Nandy looks for strikers
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Coach Raghu Nandy feels Bengals failure in the striking zone is responsible for their poor performance in the Santosh Trophy for the past few years.         
	The national championship will be held from May 24 in Chennai. Bengal last won the tournament in April 1999.         
	Bengals failure in the striking zone has been largely responsible for this  Apart from Bhaichung Bhutia and Sunil Chetri there are no strikers of substance in the country. This has been reflected in the team performance. Im trying to develop players who can score. Ive enough time in hand and working hard on this, said Nandy.         
	Out of the 43 probables, 22 have joined practice on the second day. The I-League players will join the camp after April 16, he said.         
	The coach is not banking on players from East Bengal and Mohun Bagan. Players who are only willing too to put their 100 per cent will be included. Players from the big clubs are too professional  I dont blame them. They cant risk getting injured there. I dont mind losing but want to develop a set of players who are tough mentally and have good fighting qualities.         
	Nandy is happy with the players in hand. The quality is good. There are some very promising players Players, who have already been booked by the big clubs for the forthcoming season.         
	The final squad will be decided in the first week of May.

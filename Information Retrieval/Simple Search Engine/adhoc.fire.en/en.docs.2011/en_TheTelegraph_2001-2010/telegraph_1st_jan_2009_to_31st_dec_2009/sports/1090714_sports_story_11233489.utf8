The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CRICKET BRIEFS   Kevins was an ego shot, says Warne
                                                   CRICKET BRIEFS                                     
	 Kevins was an ego shot, says Warne
    
	London: Australian spin legend Shane Warne has termed Kevin Pietersens unconventional paddle sweep in the opening Ashes Test as an ego shot which the England batsman should have avoided to put the team first, not himself.  
	You have to be careful not to over-criticise. Any batsman can get out. What matters is the way they get out, because that reveals their thought processes about batting. It seemed that Pietersen just wanted to keep playing sweep shots against (Nathan) Hauritz. To me, that is an ego shot, Warne said.         
	Laxman show         
	 London: VVS Laxman hit a sedate unbeaten 64 to script Lanashires seven-wicket win over Worcestershire in the division one County Championship at Old Trafford. The Indian, who scored only 19 in the first innings, more than made up when it mattered most and remained unbeaten after a 93-ball knock studded with six fours.         
	Brief scores         
	Worcestershire 172 amp; 236. Lancashire 145 amp; 264/3. Lancashire won by 7 wkts.         
	SA squad         
	 Durban: Hosts South Africa named a provisional squad of 20 players for the ICC Champions Trophy tournament to be held from September 22 to October 5. Cricket South Africa selection committee convenor Mike Proctor said the squad would be trimmed to the final 15 prior to the start of the tournament.         
	The Squad         
	Graeme Smith (capt.), Johan Botha, Yusuf Abdulla, Hashim Amla, Mark Boucher, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Herschelle Gibbs, Jacques Kallis, Charl Langeveldt, Albie Morkel, Morne Morkel, Makhaya Ntini, Justin Ontong, Wayne Parnell, Robbie Peterson, Dale Steyn, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Roelof van der Merwe, and Vaughn van Jaarsveld.         
	Tour itinerary         
	 Wellington: New Zealand Cricket (NZC) has approved the revised itinerary for next months tour of Sri Lanka, which will include an extra three-day warm-up match and a limited-overs tri-series involving India. New Zealand Cricket has also endorsed security arrangements for the tour.

	Afridi view         
	 Karachi: Shahid Afridi is a miffed man, who believes the team did not get enough time to celebrate their World Twenty20 triumph. The team should have had at least a month or so to enjoy the taste of victory, Afridi said.

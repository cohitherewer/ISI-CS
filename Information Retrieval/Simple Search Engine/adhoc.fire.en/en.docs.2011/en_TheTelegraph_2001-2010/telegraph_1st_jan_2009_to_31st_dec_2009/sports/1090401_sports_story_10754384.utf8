The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United desperate for points
                                                   United desperate for points
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: United SC will be looking to grab as many points as possible in their attempt to avoid relegation when they take on Mumbai FC in the 21st and penultimate round of the I-League here Wednesday.         
	Maybe just one point, maybe full points. We have to take whatever we can but we cannot afford to lose, coach Subrata Bhattacharjee told The Telegraph on the eve of the match at the Cooperage.         
	The Calcutta club, ranked 11th in the 12-team league, are facing relegation along with Goas Vasco SC.         
	But with only one point separating three teams  United have 21 points, the same as JCT who are at 10th owing to their superior goal difference, and ninth-placed Mohammedan Sporting have 22  the visitors still hope to stay in the elite division. And Air India are not out of reach with 23 points.         
	We are not the only one, three-four teams are fighting relegation, Bhattacharjee said.         
	The teams morale would have been boosted after a 0-0 draw to defending champions Dempo and the fact that they dont have any injury problems or suspensions should help them.         
	The only factor that could hamper them is the Mumbai weather which has been scorching hot in the last few days, and no floodlights at the Cooperage means the match would begin as usual at 4pm. It (the match) definitely should start later, the visiting coach said.         
	Besides, the Cooperage also poses unique challenges to the visiting teams due to its smaller size and the bumpy pitch. Bhattacharjee felt that would not be an issue. The pitch is good. It was worse in our days, he said.         
	Debutants Mumbai FC will be licking their wounds after a 2-0 loss away to Mohammedan Sporting last week.         
	The hosts would be without defender James Dissiramah, who continues to be injured, and Nishant Mehra, who has two yellow cards against his name.         
	Coach David Booth refuted talk that the teams intensity is tapering off as the season approaches its end.         
	No, not at all. I looked at the last six games and I have to say that the refereeing has not been great. Two penalties have been awarded against us and we had two goals disallowed, the Englishman said.         
	The penalty that was awarded against us in the Mohammedan Sporting match was disgraceful. It took the game away from us.         
	Booth, however, was more jovial when it came to predicting the outcome of the match. We drew them 1-1 in the first phase and 0-0 in the Federation Cup. So, its going to be another draw, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australians in cruise control

	Melbourne: Australia openers  Shane Watson and Simon Katich  missed their centuries by a whisker as the hosts finished Day I at 305 for three in the first Test against Pakistan in Melbourne on Saturday.         
	According to cricinfo.com, Simon Katich and Shane Watson added to their mounting collection of unusual dismissals in the 90s, although both might have expected earlier return trips to the pavilion had Pakistan held onto their chances in the field.         
	The highlight of the Day Is play was unquestionably the run-out of Watson, which saw both batsmen stranded at the strikers end while Imran Farhat merrily removed the bails at the other.         
	Katichs tendancy to call while advancing down the wicket coaxed his partner into the run, and Watsons refusal to turn back led to an awkward situation in which the two openers stood their ground for more than a minute awaiting the verdict as to who should leave the field.         
	The decision narrowly went against Watson (93), and his dejection was plain for all to see. The converted opener has been dismissed three times this summer between scores of 89 and 96; a maiden Test century proving elusive as ever.         
	He will, however, take solace from his imperious driving against Mohammed Aamer early in his innings, which went far to sealing a sixth half-century from 11 innings since assuming the openers post from Phillip Hughes at Edgbaston.         
	Only once in that time has he registered a total less than 30.         
	Centuries may make for nice window dressing, but consistency remains battings ultimate goal.         
	Ricky Ponting showed few ill effects from the elbow injury that threatened his participation in the match, racing to a half-century from just 55 balls, but his innings also fell short of triple-figures.

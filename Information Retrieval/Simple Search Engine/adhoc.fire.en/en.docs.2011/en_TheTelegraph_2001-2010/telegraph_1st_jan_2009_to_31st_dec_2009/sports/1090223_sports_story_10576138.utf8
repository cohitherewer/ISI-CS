The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Amateur Lee wins crown
                                                   Amateur Lee wins crown
                      
	Sydney: New Zealand teenager Danny Lee became the youngest player to win a professional European Tour event with victory in the Johnnie Walker Classic at Perth on Sunday.         
	The 18-year-old produced a superb finish to win the tournament by a single stroke and enhance his reputation as one of most exciting young players.         
	Lee, who burst onto the world stage by winning last years US amateur championship, held his nerve in a tight finish by making birdies on four of the last six holes for a final round of five-under-par 67 and a winning total of 17-under 271.         
	It feels like Im dreaming at the moment. I won lots of amateur tournaments before and the US Amateur but this is a totally different feeling, he said at the trophy ceremony.         
	Its a pro event. All I wanted to do was make the cut and play well and get in the top-20. But I played extremely well today and I won it.         
	Britains Ross McGowan led by two shots with five holes to play after making an eagle at the ninth but two late bogeys cost him his chance of winning his first professional title.         
	The 26-year-old closed with a 70 to finish tied for second with Japans Hiroyuki Fujita (67) and Chiles Felipe Aguiler (68) at 16 under. (REUTERS)

            A STAFF REPORTER            Ashutosh Singh and Ankita Raina with their trophies, at the South Club, on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Delhis Ashutosh Singh made a valiant comeback after losing the first set 0-6 to beat PC Vignesh of Andhra Pradesh, the fifth seed, in the mens singles final at the Vishwarupa Tubes National Grasscourt Championship at South Club. The final result was 0-6, 7-6(3), 6-2 in the qualifiers favour.         
	In the womens singles final, 16-year-old Ankita Raina beat Sheethal Goutham 7-6(2), 6-2.         
	The Gujarat girl, who is now based in Pune, broke Sheethal twice to go 3-0 up but the veteran showed a lot of resolve making it 5-5.         
	Ankita however had a good tie-break to win the first set 7-6.         
	She played brilliantly in the second set and went 5-0 up before Sheethal won two games. Ankita closed the match in the eighth game.         
	The mens doubles was won by Vijay Sundar Prashanth and Mithun Murali of Tamil Nadu who beat the Delhi duo of Vivek Shokeen and Sanam Singh 6-4, 6-7(4), 11-9.         
	There was something to cheer for locally, as city girls Shivika Burman and Treta Bhattacharya, the top-seeded pair, beat Sheetal and Shweta Solanki 7-6(2), 1-6, 10-7 to clinch the womens doubles title.         
	It was the second national title for 27-year-old Ashutosh who is on the probables list for next years Commonwealth Games. His earlier victory came at the Hardcourt Nationals in 2007 in Delhi.         
	It was Vignesh who started the match on a strong note as he hit some fantastic winners not giving Ashutosh a chance to come near the net. Both preferred to play from the baseline, rather than come up to the net.         
	After his serve was broken thrice in the first set, Ashutosh slowly came back in the second making fewer unforced errors.         
	He held on to his serve and took the set to a tie-breaker and won it 7-3, to level proceedings.         
	The deciding set saw Ashutosh break Vigneshs serve twice and warp it up in style.         
	I knew that it was difficult for Vignesh to maintain the tempo after first set. I knew that I will get a chance to comeback, the newly-crowned national champion said.         
	The Delhi lad will be now playing a few Futures tournaments in Morocco in January to earn some points.         
	Due to an Achilles tendon injury, Ashutosh hasnt played any tournament since August.         
	Now my next aim is to seal one of the two spots available for the Commonwealth Games as four slots have already been booked by Davis Cuppers Leander Paes, Mahesh Bhupathi, Yuki Bhambri and Somdev Dev Varman.

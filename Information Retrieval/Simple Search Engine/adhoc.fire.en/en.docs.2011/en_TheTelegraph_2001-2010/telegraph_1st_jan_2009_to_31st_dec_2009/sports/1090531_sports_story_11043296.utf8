	London: Guus Hiddink was handed the FA Cup as a going-away present as Chelsea recovered from conceding the fastest goal in final history to beat Everton.         
	The contest was less than half a minute old when Louis Saha found the net for the Merseyside team. It was to be a high point for Everton though as Didier Drogba levelled before Frank Lampards 20-yard strike just evaded the despairing dive of Tim Howard 18 minutes from time.         
	Apart from allowing Ashley Cole to become the first player since the 19th century to collect five winners medals, the victory, Chelseas second in three years at new Wembley, is a reminder of the stability Hiddink has brought to Stamford Bridge since replacing Luiz Felipe Scolari in February.         
	After a pair of tepid semi-finals, the Wembley authorities changed the pitch and their groundsman in the hope of getting something better in place for their showpiece occasion. The reward came after exactly 25 seconds.         
	There was a fair bit of venom in Sahas left foot when Marouane Fellaini guided Michael Essiens weak clearance into the former Manchester United mans path. Saha met the ball perfectly, leaving Petr Cech with not a hope of keeping it out.         
	If there is a downside to scoring quite so early, it is the length of time left to hang on.         
	Everton did try to keep pushing forward. It was just that they were not allowed to as Chelsea shook off that massive initial disappointment and slowly but purposefully turned the screw.         
	Tony Hibbert is what is known in the trade as an honest professional. Dedicated to his task, what he lacks in ability, he tries to make up for in effort. Sometimes though, it is not enough.         
	Booked after eight minutes for a needless ankle tap on Malouda, he was then repeatedly exposed by the French wide-man, a clear case of Chelsea targeting an individual within opposition ranks.         
	Malouda delivered the cross that invited Drogbas powerful finish for the Chelsea equaliser, Cole had the angled drive that should have put them in front.         
	In stemming an obvious flow of attacks on their goal, Everton found it easier to relieve the pressure and apply some of their own.         
	But how quickly they were crushed. After collecting Anelkas lay-off, Lampard was assisted by a slight slip as he checked inside Phil Neville  allowing him a couple of extra seconds to get a sight of Evertons goal and he duly drilled home from 20 yards.         
	Chelsea were twice controversially denied a third, first when referee Howard Webb decided Maloudas effort had not crossed the line after crashing back off the bar when TV replays showed it had, then when the official booked Lampard for diving when Stephen Pienaar had stuck out a leg for him to fall over.         
	It did not matter. Hiddink richly deserved to wave goodbye with a glint of silverware in his eye.

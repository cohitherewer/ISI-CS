The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Second loss for Chargers
                                                   Second loss for Chargers
                      
	Port Elizabeth: Lee Carseldine top-scored with 39 and Abhishek Raut hit an unbeaten 36 to steer the Rajasthan Royals to a three-wicket win over the Deccan Chargers in the Indian Premier League on Saturday.         
	Carseldine, a 33-year-old Australian left hander, hit six boundaries in 32 balls in the Royals 142 for seven, dominating a crucial third wicket partnership that produced 51 runs with Ravindra Jadeja (12 off 17 balls). The pair steadied the innings after the Rajasthan side lost their openers, Graeme Smith and Swapnil Asnoskar, for ducks in the first over.         
	Smith was dismissed with the second ball of the match, caught in the deep by Shoaib Ahmed off Fidel Edwards. Asnodkar followed next ball, a mix-up with Carseldine resulting in a run out.         
	Herschelle Gibbs then took a fine catch at point off R.P. Singh in the second over to dismiss Naman Ojha, also for a duck, to leave the Royals in deep trouble on 3 for three.         
	Carseldine and Jadeja were both dismissed in the 10th over. Jadeja was first to go, lofting Venugopal Rao to Dwayne Smith at long on. Four balls later Carseldine was adjudged leg before wicket to Rao. The 22-year-old Indian Raut and the Royals captain Shane Warne (21 off 17 balls) then revived the chase with a 36-run sixth wicket stand.         
	Warne departed when he skied a fuller Pragyan Ojha delivery to the Chargers captain Adam Gilchrist in the 15th over. This brought Man of the Match Yusuf Pathan to the crease, and he proceeded to score 24 runs off just 14 balls at number eight before getting a leading edge to Gibbs at point off RP to leave the Rajasthan side on 131 for seven.         
	Needing 2 runs to win off the final over, Raut and Shane Harwood (3 not out) took the Rajasthan Royals home in a nail-biting finish, which saw the Deccan Chargers miss two run-outs.         
	Earlier, Tirumalsetti Suman scored 41 not out as the Chargers reached 141 for five in the stipulated 20 overs. The 25-year-old Indian hit two boundaries and a six in 30 balls, sharing a fourth-wicket partnership of 59 with Rohit Sharma (38 off 32 balls).         
	Shane Harwood, a 35-year-old Australian fast bowler making his IPL debut for the Royals, took two for 25. Gilchrist smashed five fours and two sixes in 35 balls to score 39 at the top of the order.         
	We showed a lot of character today (Saturday), said the Royals captain Shane Warne. There is a good spirit in our camp. There is no reason now why we cant go all the way to the semis.         
	Warne defended his decision to change the batting order as he promoted himself up and sent explosive Yusuf Pathan at number eight.         
	The boys really played well. We tried to send Yusuf down the order as he finishes the game well. He hits the ball strongly and slogs well. We were happy to restrict them to 141, he said.         
	Adam Gilchrist said that his teams didnt field well in the match after suffering their second successive defeat in the IPL on Saturday. It was a great game of cricket. Both the teams had the opportunities to win. Unfortunately we lost. We bowled well but perhaps our fielders had lapse of concentration, the former Australian wicket-keeper batsman said.         
	Asked if 141 was defendable, he nodded in affirmative.         
	Definitely it was defend-able. We lost it in the second-last, so it was a defendable total. After a good start, now we have a couple of setbacks, he said. (Agencies)

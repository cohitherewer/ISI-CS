The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jennings defends Uthappa choice
                                                   Jennings defends Uthappa choice
                      
	Durban: The Royal Challengers Bangalores decision to make Robin Uthappa the wicketkeeper despite having a specialist in Mark Boucher has lent balance to the side, says coach Ray Jennings and adds that the seasoned South African may have to sit out more if the experiment goes well.         
	Uthappa has kept the wickets in the Royal Challengers two matches so far and Jennings says he would continue doing so if that is what the team requires. Boucher has so far been out of action.         
	I have a lot of respect for Mark Boucher. He put my name forward to the bosses in Bangalore. At the end of the day, Marks got to understand that it was a cricketing decision. I know he is the worlds best wicketkeeper. But if our balance demands that we have got to leave him out, then thats whats got to happen, Jennings was quoted as saying on the IPLs official website.         
	Robin is keen to keep wickets and we have been working on his keeping. It puts a new dimension on the side. Maybe its a message to Dhoni to be careful because Robin is going to take his position in the Indian side, joked the South African.           (PTI)

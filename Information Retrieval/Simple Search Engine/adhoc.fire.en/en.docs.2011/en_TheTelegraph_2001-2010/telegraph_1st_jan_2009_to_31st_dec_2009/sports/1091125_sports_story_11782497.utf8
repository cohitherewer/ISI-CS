The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Referee mulled quitting 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Referee mulled quitting 
                      
	Stockholm: The Swedish referee who failed to spot Thierry Henrys handball in the World Cup playoff between France and Ireland says the incident made him consider quitting.         
	Martin Hansson said in Tuesdays edition of a regional Swedish newspaper that the criticism that followed made him wonder whether it was worth continuing his eight-year career as an international referee.         
	I thought: is the job really worth all this degradation that I have to hear? Maybe this is not my thing, said Hansson, adding that even his parents had been hounded by journalists wanting to photograph their house.         
	The 38-year-old Hansson, who began his professional career as a referee in 1992, said he wasnt to blame and nor were his linesmen as all their views of the incident were obstructed.         
	I realise that it was not my fault. It was an unfortunate event that had big consequences for Ireland, but it wasnt the fault of the refereeing team, Hansson said. At first, I thought all the fuss was just about the goal itself but it wasnt. Whats more, the graphic (a graphic reproduction of the incident involving Henry) clears the whole refereeing team in this incident.         
	He is due to return to refereeing in the Champions League on Dec. 8 or 9, and is looking forward to getting back on the pitch. It feels good to get a match so soon after this unfortunate episode, Hansson said. But best of all has been the support Ive had from players and team officials.         
	On Monday, Henry said the incident also pushed him to the brink of international retirement. (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chowrasia makes cut
                                                     Chowrasia makes cut
                  SSP Chowrasia                     
	Paris: S.S.P Chowrasia was the lone Indian to make the cut after carding a two-over 73 even as compatriots Jeev Milkha Singh, Jyoti Randhawa and Shiv Kapur fell by the wayside at Open de France Alstom golf tournament here.         
	Chowrasia, who carded a 69 in the first round, was tied 44th with a two-day total of 142 here.         
	Jeev, on the other hand, brought home a horrendous six-over 77, while Jyoti turned in a three-over 74.         
	Shiv also failed to sneak inside the cutline, which was decided at one-over, after bringing home a second successive one-over 72 in the second round Friday.         
	Chowrasias back nine spoilt his card as the Indian stumbled upon consecutive bogeys on 13th and 14th holes before hitting another bogey on the 17th.         
	His front nine was, however, studded with birdies at the first, fifth and seventh against a couple of bogeys at the fourth and eighth.         
	At the top, Rafa Echenique of Argentina blasted a four-under 67 to grab the lead, while there was a three way tie for the second place among German Martin Kaymer (72), Russian Charl Schwartzel (66) and Englishman Steve Webster (65).         
	Echenique was briefly caught by the chasing pack after the turn when he fell into a tie for the lead with Waring and Charl Schwartzel of South Africa at 10 under.         
	A runner-up at the BMW International Open in Munich last weekend, Echenique started his third round slowly with a bogey on the first hole that cut his overnight lead one stroke.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Van Wyk set to open with McCullum 
                                                   Van Wyk set to open with McCullum 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: With the West Indies captain Chris Gayle having already left for England, South African Morne van Wyk is set to open the batting for the Kolkata Knight Riders with captain Brendon McCullum against the Delhi DareDevils in Durban on Tuesday.         
	Gayle and McCullum have opened for the Knight Riders on all but one occasion. Sourav Ganguly was sent out to open the innings with Gayle against the Mumbai Indians last Friday.         
	The West Indies captain will lead his team against England in the first Test match, which starts on Wednesday at Lords.         
	Till the evening, it was not decided whod take Gayles place as the fourth foreigner in the side. Sri Lankan spinner Ajantha Mendis might return to the side. In that case, spinner Murali Kartik might have to sit out. Yashpal Singh will come in if the Knights decide to strengthen their batting.         
	The second edition of the IPL has been disappointing, to say the least, for the Knight Riders. They have lost six out of their eight matches so far.         
	They are yet to play the DareDevils in the tournament. The Delhi team, led by Virender Sehwag are currently placed third with four wins from six matches.         
	But, the DareDevils also have their share of problems with Sehwags form and fitness being a concern. The right-hander picked up a finger injury recently which kept him out of the match against the Chennai Super Kings. His availability for Tuesdays match is still uncertain.

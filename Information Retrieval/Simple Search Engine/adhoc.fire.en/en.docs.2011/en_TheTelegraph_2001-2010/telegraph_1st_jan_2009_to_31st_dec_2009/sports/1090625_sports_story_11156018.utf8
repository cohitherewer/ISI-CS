The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Manoj threatens to quit Bagan
                                                     Manoj threatens to quit Bagan
            A STAFF REPORTER            Manoj                           
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan Wednesday received an ultimatum from Manoj Tiwary that he will leave the club if Abdul Munayam is not removed as coach within the next three days.         
	Yes, I have told Srinjoy Bose that if he (Munayam) remains coach I will not play for them. He is bringing negative influence into the team and if he is there I will have to think of leaving. I have my options open, Manoj told The Telegraph.         
	Look, whenever I have played for any side I have given my 100 per cent. I have played the P Sen Trophy though I am not fully fit My finger injury is yet to heal and I am only 80 per cent fit Everybody knows that. Still I have played. But Munayam has questioned my commitment He was spoiling the team spirit, the 23-year old batsman added.         
	Incidentally, Manojs unhappiness was clear on Wednesday after the P Sen Trophy final.         
	Moments after Bagans victory over Town Club, Manoj skipped the photo session with teammates and disappeared into the dressing room. Later he also skipped the club flag hoisting ceremony at the Mohun Bagan ground.         
	I had some work back home I was in a hurry so I skipped that flag hoisting ceremony. There is nothing else in it, Manoj later said.         
	Some players hinted that the problem started after Debabrata Das replaced Manoj as captain, first on Monday in the semi-final against Kalighat and then in Wednesdays final. But Manoj rubbished the issue and said: Debabrata (Das) is like my brother There was no problem that he captained the side Actually I had told Srinjoyda I dont want to be the captain because I saw what was destroying the team sprit         
	I have respect for every senior player but if somebody like Munayam questions my commitment then it hurts, he said.         
	However, Munayam, when contacted, said that the club officials know how to deal with the issue. I dont want to say anything I have worked hard and everybody knows that. The officials know what is true. I dont want to say anything more.         
	A top Bagan official confirmed receiving the message from Manoj but said that both the batsman and the coach will be called for a meeting before any decision was taken.         
	We have no problem with Manoj But yes, as we have received a complaint from him we will see to it that a proper solution is reached, the official said.

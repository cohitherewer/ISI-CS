The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AIFF plays safe
                                                   AIFF plays safe
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has decided not to use the services of any referee from Bengal or Goa in the final round of matches of the I-League on Thursday.         
	The AIFF has already made up its mind on the set of referees to be used in the six matches across the country but has kept the appointments a closely guarded secret.         
	We could have used Bengal or Goa referees for matches where Goa and Bengal teams are not involved but later decided against it, said an AIFF official.         
	For the Delhi match between Mohun Bagan and Mahindra United, the AIFF has hired the services of a private agency for stadium security on the day of the match.         
	Meanwhile, Mahindra coach Derek Pereira Tuesday expressed regret for his conduct during the I-League match against Dempo and was exonerated by the disciplinary committee.         
	Mahindra, however, will miss the services of their star midfielder, Steven Dias against Mohun Bagan due to a double booking.

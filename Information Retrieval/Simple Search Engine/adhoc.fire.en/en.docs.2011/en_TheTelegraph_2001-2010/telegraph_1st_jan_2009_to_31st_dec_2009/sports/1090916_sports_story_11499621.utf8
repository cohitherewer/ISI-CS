                                                   Tendulkar is back in ODI top-10
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar has returned to the top-10 on the batsmens list in the ICC ODI rankings after crowning an emphatic return to ODIs with a Man of the Series-winning show in the tri-series in Sri Lanka.         
	Sachin, whose 138 was the cornerstone of Indias total of 319, has leaped five places to seventh in the latest rankings released Tuesday.         
	The rankings held good tidings also for Yuvraj Singh who achieved a career-best No.2 on the all-rounders list, apart from occupying the same spot, below India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, on the batsmens chart. For the all-rounders second, Yuvraj has leapfrogged Jacques Kallis, Jacob Oram and Andrew Flintoff into second place.         
	Meanwhile, India have moved back to second in the ICC ODI Championship.         
	Dhonis boys briefly enjoyed top spot in the team rankings after beating New Zealand earlier in the series but within 24 hours had slipped to third after a loss to the hosts on Saturday, the same day Australia beat England by seven wickets at Lords to sneak ahead into second position.         
	But this latest victory puts India back to within a single ratings point of South Africa.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | John accepts England role
                                                   John accepts England role
                      
	Melbourne: Former Australia coach John Buchanan has accepted a short-term coaching assignment with England ahead of the Ashes and is hopeful of eventually landing a long-term consultants job with the side.         
	[That discussions were on between Buchanan and the ECB on an arrangement which could eventually see him in the role of a consultant during the forthcoming Ashes was reported by The Telegraph on March 25.]         
	Even though Buchanan refused to disclose whether he would pass on crucial information about the key Australian players, the coach had no qualms about his new role even though some people think it borders on treachery.         
	It is my own business who I choose to talk to and what I talk about, a curt Buchanan told a website.         
	Both myself and the ECB have indicated that in terms of their elite programme I could fulfil a role. I will fly over on June 28, have a good look at the elite programme, and sit down with them to see what potentially lies ahead. This trip will be largely about looking at the coaching programmes, and working with the Under-19s and the (England) Lions team, he said.         
	However, at least one Australian cricketer, Brett Lee, sees nothing wrong in it. John is free to do whatever he wants, Lee said. (Agencies)

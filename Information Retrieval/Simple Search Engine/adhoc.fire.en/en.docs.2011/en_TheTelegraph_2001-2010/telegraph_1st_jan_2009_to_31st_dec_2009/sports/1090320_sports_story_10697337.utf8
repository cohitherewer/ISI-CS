The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | After the bullets, Ahsan Raza hit by ICC, PCB indifference
                                                     After the bullets, Ahsan Raza hit by ICC, PCB indifference
    - Umpires family has also been made to pay for 20 bottles of blood             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ahsan Raza                                 
	Calcutta:Ahsan Raza didnt make it big at the first-class level, but the keeper-batsmans passion for cricket made him turn to umpiring. Today, recovering from multiple gunshot wounds, in Lahore, hes probably regretting that move.         
	The International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) have, after all, either done nothing or very little for the fourth umpire who risked his life trying to save Englishman Chris Broad, whod been the Match Referee in the Pakistan-Sri Lanka Test series.         
	Raza, 34, was in the match officials Toyota Coaster when terrorists struck near the Gaddafi on the morning of March 3.         
	He took bullets in his kidney, diaphragm and lungs and has since been in the ICU of a government-run (or, should it be run down?) hospital on Jail Road.         
	Razas likely to remain there for another three days. His family, understandably, is desperate to get him home at the earliest.         
	Such is the hospitals state that the ICUs air-conditioning unit hasnt been working for three months! With Razas stitches drying and beginning to itch and the mercury rising, his family had to buy a pedestal fan, which is now next to his bed.         
	Thats not all.         
	On Thursday, The Telegraph learnt that Razas family also had no choice but to purchase 20 bottles of (B-Positive) blood and innumerable litres of mineral water.         
	The PCB has only been meeting the cost of medicines. That apart, neither has a Rupee been paid as compensation nor any commitment made by the national body.         
	Strangely, theres been no word from either the provincial or the federal governments. But, then, bigger issues were at play till a few days ago.         
	Now that Iftikhar Chaudhry is coming back as the Chief Justice of Pakistan somebody will, perhaps, spare a thought for Raza.         
	Give him justice.         
	Its a question of Razas career... He has three daughters (aged between one and six) to look after... Please dont write anything which could harm him professionally, pleaded somebody from the umpires family, while speaking to this paper.         
	Clearly, its the fear of victimisation in these already troubled times which has made the Lahore-based family accept such indifference without even a murmur.         
	Emotionally, though, the family member did ask: Would a cricketer have received the same treatment? Would his family have to run around for blood and would they have been compelled to buy a fan? Many have said do get in touch if you need anything, but havent they seen Razas condition? Do we need to beg for help? Is this the way to recognise a brave umpire?         
	The terror strike resulted in eight deaths, including that of the driver ferrying the match officials. Raza came perilously close to being the ninth victim.         
	One couldnt get through to the PCB, but a comment (pretty insensitive at that) was got from the world body.         
	Didnt the ICC too have a responsibility towards ensuring that Raza got the best medical attention and in the most comfortable environment?         
	To that question, communications officer James Fitzgerald replied: Officially, probably not... Morally, yes... Razas appointment was from the PCB... Were in touch with his family and are happy that hes recovering fast.         
	Bottomline is that Raza was very much a part of the second (and final) Tests Match Control Team and the ICC surely has more than just moral responsibility.         
	Going by the laws, should one of those on the field fall ill, then the fourth umpire gets to play a bigger role as hell have to sit before the TV and adjudicate on referrals.         
	According to the communications officer, the ICC could, down the road, look at offering compensation to Raza. Its being talked about, but no decision has been taken...         
	Well, till something meaningful is done, Raza will probably be left cursing himself for having taken to the white (safed vardi) coat.

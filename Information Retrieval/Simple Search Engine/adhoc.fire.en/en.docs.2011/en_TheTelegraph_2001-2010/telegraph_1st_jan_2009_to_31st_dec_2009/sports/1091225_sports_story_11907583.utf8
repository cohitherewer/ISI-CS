The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Daredevils do it for India

	Calcutta: This was a stellar show you wont forget in a hurry. Team India have been on a roll, and on Thursday they steamrolled, digging the Sri Lankans into a hole in the Karbonn Cup.         
	The Delhi daredevils  Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli  produced an electrifying display that left the visitors stunned and searching for answers. Gambhir and Kohlis centuries and their 224-run partnership in 214 balls ensured an unassailable 3-1 lead in the series rendering the final game at the Kotla to only of academic interest.         
	They took the sting out of the Lankan bowling and made the daunting 316-run target look too little in the end. Gambhir played the role of senior pro to perfection, anchoring the innings and staying till the end, to hit the winning runs and seal the seven-wicket victory.         
	Gambhirs unbeaten 150 needed only 137 balls and included 14 boundaries. A gem that the capacity crowd will recall with the very best at Eden Gardens.         
	The Indians seemed determined in their endeavour and nothing could disturb their concentration.         
	The lights went out  one of the towers at the high court end  with four balls remaining in the Lankan innings. The visitors had sent the Indians on a leather hunt and the Eden had fallen silent. Darkness gathered over gloom for 26 minutes before Gambhir and Kohli set the stands on fire.         
	With calculated and risk-free hitting, they shred the bowling into pieces. Gambhirs fluency and the grit of Kohli set to rest all doubts of Indias batting prowess.         
	It was also a test of Indias bench strength in the absence of Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh. The circumstances proved to be even tougher with the early dismissals of the openers, but the third wicket pair seemed undeterred by the circumstances.         
	While Gambhirs sublime form has been the talking point this year, Kohli has proved to be a revelation. The Delhi youngster and under-19 World Cup winning captain has made use of the limited chances that have come his way.         
	He had proved his worth with scores of 27 and 54 in Rajkot and Nagpur.         
	On Thursday, he didnt let pressure affect him and batted with the coolness and authority of a seasoned campaigner. His maiden hundred (107 off 114 balls, 11x4, 1x6) was an apt reflection of his mental strength and attitude.         
	Sri Lankas bowling suffered in the absence of Chanaka Welegedara, their most successful pacer on this tour. Welegedara injured his groin during the warm-up and the inexperienced attack lacked bite and penetration. Their task was made even tougher with the dew rendering the ball soft and prompting a change on two occasions.         
	The Indians once again paid dearly for dropped chances with Upul Tharanga and Kumar Sangakkara benefiting from the sloppiness.         
	Choosing to bat, the Lankans found the going tough as Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra allowed the batsmen very little width. Nine runs came of the first five overs without a boundary and 45 off the first 10. In the process, Nehra also bowled Indias first maiden of the series.         
	The bowling and the ground fielding looked superb as runs were hard to come by. But the two let offs left India chasing a 300-plus total and did little justice to the efforts on the field.         
	Nehra failed to hold on to a Tharanga push in the sixth over when the batsman was on seven and Harbhajan Singh, eight overs later, dropped a Sangakkara skier, running in from third man, before the visiting captain had opened his account. The pair stitched together 126 runs from 142 balls .         
	Before they got together, Zaheer and Nehra produced a superb spell of fast bowling that left the openers dazed. Dilshan, the man in form, was crippled with deliveries close to his body, before finally falling for nine.         
	As Nehra banged one short, Dilshan couldnt resist the pull. Virat Kohli sprinted to his right from backward square leg, covered a lot of ground, dived and pulled off a smart catch.                         Indians celebrate the fall of a Sri Lankan wicket.

	With the noose tightened around them, the Sri Lankans desperately needed to break free. Ishant Sharma provided Tharanga with driving length and width and he didnt waste the opportunity. Five boundaries were taken off his first over. Tharanga had galloped to 45 off 43 balls.         
	The pacer couldnt recover from the thrashing as he struggled with his line and length. The bowling fell apart as none managed to stop the Lankans flamboyant ways.         
	Comeback man Sanath Jayasuriya couldnt utilise his good start . But Tharanga and Sangakkara were on song. Not missing the singles, they never allowed the bowlers to settle onto a line.         
	Tharanga cruised to his century at almost a run-a-ball and the Lankan captain accelerated to another half-century. Tharangas 118 (128 balls, 14x4, 2x6) was his seventh century in ODIs, his first in 53 innings and came after more than three years.         
	Mahela Jayawardene (33 off 30 balls) and debutant Tissara Perera (31 off 14 balls) contributed useful cameos towards the close as the Indians managed to keep a leash on their over-rate.         
	In the end, it was a day when nothing went wrong for Team India.

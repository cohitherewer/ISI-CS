The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav upbeat
                                                                                                                                   Sourav upbeat
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly feels that the emphatic seven-wicket victory over Maharashtra will ease the pressure on Bengal when they take on Baroda at the Eden. It will not be a pressure cooker situation. This victory has given the team the much-needed confidence, Sourav said on Saturday.         
	Sourav geared up for the Baroda match with a few knocks at the Eden on the day. His last Ranji Trophy match for Bengal was against Goa in the Plate semi-finals at the Karnail Singh Stadium in New Delhi last December. He scored a 69 and helped his team to qualify for the Elite knock-out round.         
	That was a different scenario. We had to win or at least take a first innings lead in that match. But this time we are under no pressure, he said.         
	Incidentally this is Souravs 20th year as a Bengal player and said that he has always cherished playing for his state. Most of the time I was busy playing for India, but whenever I was needed by the team I responded. I have always enjoyed playing for Bengal.

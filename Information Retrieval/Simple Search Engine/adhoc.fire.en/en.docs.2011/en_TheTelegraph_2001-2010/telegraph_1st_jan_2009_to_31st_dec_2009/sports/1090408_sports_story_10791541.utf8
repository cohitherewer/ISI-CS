                                                     Were outplayed by India: Vettori
            A CORRESPONDENT            Man of the Match Gautam Gambhir in Wellington on Tuesday. (AP)                           
	Wellington: Rain on the final day meant that New Zealand escaped with a draw in the third and final Test, but Black Caps captain Daniel Vettori conceded India were a side far superior to the inexperienced home team and that at the moment Mahendra Singh Dhonis boys ranked with Australia and South Africa as one of the three best teams in the world.               
	Following are excerpts         
	On NZs performance in this Test         
	India obviously outplayed us in all departments, apart from our first couple of morning sessions where we had them at 200 for six, from then on in its been Indias game. Whether asking India to bat first was a mistake         
	I dont have any regrets about the logic of the decision. To have an Indian batting line up at 200 for six on a good wicket justified the decision.         
	What went wrong?         
	I suppose we have been inconsistent, but we have only lost one Test match. We know we have got a long way to go as a Test side. Still pleasing aspects: Jesse Ryders performance throughout the summer, Ross Taylors couple of hundreds, McCullums runs, Chris Martin was fantastic with the ball. But that doesnt mean we are satisfied with it, we know we are still No.8 in the world, and we have got to get off that as soon as possible. The present Indian side         
	They have started improving away from home. I think you can throw Australia, South Africa and India and there are the three best teams in the world, and its hard to distinguish between the three at the moment.         
	Their target in Tests         
	I havent seen the schedule. I am not sure how much cricket we have in terms of Test matches, but I know we aspire to beat the best in the world. Wed like to see some improvement, obviously get off the foot of the table, and get somewhere in the middle of the rankings. If we can get to four or fifth in the next 24 months, that will be very pleasing.         
	On the areas that need improving         
	There are a number of things we have to improve. We have to improve our consistency as a side. We do things well for a period of time, but the longevity of what we do is the thing that is causing me the most stress. We can be a good team, but we are not delivering often enough.         
	On his performance in the series         
	I was pleased with the way I went with the bat. Didnt take as many wickets as I wouldve liked. As a spin bowler, or as any bowler, all you can try to do is create chances, and if you create chances you are happy with it.         
	On whether India were late in declaring         
	I read some comments this morning about the rain forecasts for each day we have played this summer. So you can understand it, they werent sure whether it would rain or not. They dominated the Test, so they have the prerogative or right to make the declaration any time they wanted. Their bowlers were fresh. Had it been us, we would have tried to do it earlier because of the nature of our attack. We would have needed more time, but they bowled us out in 65 overs in the first innings, so they backed themselves to do that again.  
	India rsquo;s away series wins

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Werder Bremen look to end season on a high
                                                   Werder Bremen look to end season on a high
                      
	Istanbul: Werder Bremen will hope to make up for a disappointing league campaign by beating Shakhtar Donetsk to capture the Uefa Cup on Wednesday and then use that success as a springboard to also capture the German Cup.         
	But while Thomas Schaafs side chase a cup double they have slipped to 10th in the 18-team Bundesliga and are out of contention for qualification for the Europa League, which replaces the Uefa Cup next season.         
	Bremen striker Markus Rosenberg said. Its been a strange season. We are used to challenging for the Bundesliga title but that did not happen. Instead we did really well in the cups.         
	For Shakhtar Donetsk, Istanbul will be the culmination of a journey to reinvigorate Ukrainian football as the state has a team in a European final for the first time since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1990.         
	The team has goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov to thank for reaching the final after he let in just five goals in eight Uefa Cup matches on the way to Istanbul. Pyatov though deflected praise to his defenders.         
	All in all, its more thanks to the defenders  my role is as a leader, the goalkeeper said. The better I can lead the team  the defence, that is  the easier it is for me. (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tendulkar praises Abhishek
                                                   Tendulkar praises Abhishek
                      
	Cape Town: Mumbai Indians captain Sachin Tendulkar wants to build on the good start his team made in the Indian Premier League (IPL) with a resounding win over last years runners-up Chennai Super Kings.         
	Tendulkar, who scored an unbeaten 59 to script his teams victory in the opening match of the second edition of the Twenty20 extravaganza, said: The start is good but its still a long way to go. I wont take anything for granted.         
	Tendulkar said the initial overs were difficult for batting and lavished praise on Sanath Jayasuriya and Abhishek Nayar for adjusting well.         
	When I lost the toss, I realised there was dampness in the wicket. The first 6-7 overs were difficult and later on, Abhishek came and played a terrific innings. My job, basically, was to just be there and play till the end and let the guy at the other end play their strokes, he said.         
	Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni admitted that they were outsmarted by their rivals.         
	I think we gave away a few deliveries in the end and their batsmen Jayasuriya and Tendulkar played brilliantly, and then Abhishek, down the order, also played well. Also, they bowled well. So overall, I think they played better cricket than us, Dhoni said.         
	Albie misses out         
	Albie Morkel couldnt play for Chennai Super Kings on Saturday after the airline misplaced his kit. He was travelling from Johannesburg after playing the final one-dayer against Australia on Friday. Captain Dhoni was naturally very upset about it.

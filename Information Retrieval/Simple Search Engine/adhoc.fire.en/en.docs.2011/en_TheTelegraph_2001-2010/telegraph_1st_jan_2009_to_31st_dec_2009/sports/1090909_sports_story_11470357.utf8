                                                   Mixed reaction to the new turf
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The artificial turf at the Salt Lake Stadium boasts of being the first of its kind in a full fledged soccer ground in the subcontinent. But the debate over the suitability of the turf for competitive matches still rages on.         
	On Tuesday, the surface got its first taste of real-time soccer as the first semi-final of the IFA Shield, between Churchill Brothers and Air India, was played and that too for the maximum quota of 120 minutes. Opinions on the turf were bound to surface at the end of the match and, from what the players and the coaches said, it may be inferred that not everyone was impressed.         
	Churchills Gourmangi Singh felt that the pace off the pitch was a bit of a problem for the players. The balls were moving too fast for us to be comfortable. Judging the balls off the ground was a definite problem. It was hard to anticipate the speed, he said.         
	Gourmangi also said that too much energy were being required for playing on this turf. The ground is sapping a lot of energy from us. You need to put in that extra bit of effort to succeed on this type of synthetic turfs, he added.         
	Asked if the match slipping into the extra time added to their list of problems, the India defender agreed: Yeah, that made things more difficult. Playing 120 minutes is a bit tough on this surface.         
	He was also worried with the fact that the artificial turf didnt offer the ideal reflex pressure. If you miss-kick and hit the ground in the process, theres every possibility of getting injured. The surface doesnt react like the normal grounds. , he cautioned.         
	According to Gourmangi, Tuesdays torrential rain was a blessing saying that with the sun blazing, it would have been virtually unplayable on the artificial turf. Everything was okay in the end because of the rain Had it not rained, the heat and the smell of the rubber granules, which are scattered all over the ground, would have made it extremely difficult, he said.         
	Air India coach Bimal Ghosh harboured similar views. Rain eased things out today (Tuesday). But under sunny conditions I have my doubts. If it doesnt rain on Wednesday, Mohun Bagan and Chirag United (in the second semi-final) will have a torrid time with the surface giving off too much heat, he summed up. Also, theres too much strain on the players.         
	But his counterpart, Carlos Pereira, dismissed any negative views on the ground. There was no problem with the turf today. It was okay. It cant be an excuse, he said.         
	Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa, who was present at Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday, also sounded confident ahead of their match on the same surface. The ground was good. No major problems. We will have to cope with it. But I have no separate plans for the turf.         
	Chirag coach Subrata Bhattacharya, on the other hand, was unsure about the turf on the eve of the second semi-final match.         
	But Gourmangi went to the extent of saying: I, as a player, would prefer a natural surface any day. Thats far better. For the I-League matches in Calcutta, I would definitely prefer the Barasat Stadium to this ground.         
	So, in a nutshell, doubts about the turf still lingers on and it will, perhaps, require more tests to receive a thumbs-up from all quarters.

                                                   Deep, five others included
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Six former Indian Cricket League players  Deep Dasgupta, Rohan Gavaskar, Shib Sagar Singh, Subhomoy Das, Abhishek Jhunjhunwala, and Eklakh Ahmed  were on Monday included among the 35-strong Bengal probables for the upcoming season.         
	However, Subhojit Paul, who also played in the ICL, was not considered because of fitness issues. Practice begins Friday under Vece Paes. Coach Roger Binny is likely to arrive on Saturday.         
	Batsman Arindam Das and spinner Priyankar Mukherjee were, however, not included among the probables.         
	Arindam is a senior player. We already have too many openers in the list. Under the current circumstances, he doesnt fit into Bengals scheme of things. So, there was no point in including him if he was uncertain for the 14-member squad, chief selector Sambaran Banerjee said.         
	On Priyankars omission, he said: Priyankar has a suspect action. He is in the BCCIs list of bowlers with a suspect action. The Board is keeping a close eye on such players. So theres no pint including him.         
	Pacer Shib Shankar Paul has been included subject to his passing the fitness. He had a surgery recently. He has been asked to come to practice and we will assess his condition there, Sambaran said.         
	However, according to sources, Paul was planning to start practice only in early September.         
	Former Bengal captain Deep said he was looking forward to the new season. Its good to be back. Ive spent the majority of my career here, so its great to be back.         
	Obviously my first priority will be to perform for the team We havent been playing that well for the past two years and so we should put our heads down and work for the betterment of the team. Theres a lot of young talent this time I would like to help them, he added.         
	Another ICL player, Jhunjhunwala said: I was waiting for this opportunity for a long time. It will be great if I get a chance to represent Bengal again. I want to give my best and perform for the team.

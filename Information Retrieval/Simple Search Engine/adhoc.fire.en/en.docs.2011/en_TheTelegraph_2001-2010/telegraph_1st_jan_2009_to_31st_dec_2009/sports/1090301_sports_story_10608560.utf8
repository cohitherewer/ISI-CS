The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rory shines, big names bite the dust
                                                     Rory shines, big names bite the dust
                  Rory McIlroy                     
	Marana (Arizona): Teenage sensation Rory McIlroy did his part to put some excitement back into the Accenture Match Play Championship, advancing to the quarter finals on Friday by crushing the player who knocked out Tiger Woods.         
	The same could not be said for Phil Mickelson, who failed to reach the weekend for the fifth straight year.         
	McIlroy, the 19-year-old from Northern Ireland who keeps adding credentials to be the next young star, built a 4-up lead after six holes and never gave Tim Clark of South Africa a chance to catch up in a 4 and 3 victory.         
	He was three matches away from becoming the youngest winner in the history of American professional golf.         
	Tim didnt play his best golf today, understandably, McIlroy said. He was probably a little flat after all that happened yesterday. And I came out and got off to quite a fast start.         
	One day after Clark was practically flawless in sending Woods home early from Dove Mountain, hardly anything went right. It was the third straight time that a player who beat Woods in this tournament lost in the next round.         
	The atmosphere was far more subdued than earlier in the week, when Woods made his heralded return to golf from knee surgery after an eight-month absence, only to last two rounds.         
	The gallery spread itself among the eight matches, and there were some entertaining ones, for sure.         
	Mickelson had not trailed all week until Stewart Cink ran off three straight birdies to build a 3-up lead after four holes. Mickelson rallied to square the match twice, and both times let it get away.         
	He hit his tee shot into a desert bush on the 15th hole and fell behind, then tied it on the 16th when Cink missed the green. But on the next hole, Mickelsons third shot from a desert waste area sailed over the gallery, and he missed a 4-foot bogey putt to lose the hole. His last chance was a 20-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole, which missed below the cup.         
	Ernie Els, in the quarter finals for only the second time, had a 1-up lead on the 18th tee when Luke Donald felt a twinge in his left wrist and decided to concede the match instead of risking further injury. Donald had surgery on that wrist six months ago, and returned to competition only in December.         
	Els has not trailed in any of this three matches and next plays Cink.         
	Geoff Ogilvy took advantage of shaky putting by Camilo Villegas for a 2-and-1 victory, raising his career record to 14-2 while Paul Casey of England built a quick lead and beat Peter Hanson of Sweden 3 and 2. Casey joined Els as the only players remaining who have not been behind all week.         
	Ross Fisher of England made seven birdies in beating Jim Furyk, 4 and 3. Sean Hair lost the first two holes, then won three straight holes on the back nine to beat Ian Poulter 2 and 1.         
	Justin Leonard chipped in for birdie on the 17th hole, then watched Oliver Wilson of England roll in a 6-foot birdie putt on the 18th. Leonard won with a par on the first extra hole, the only match to go overtime on Friday.         
	Of all the young players starting to emerge, McIlroy is getting as much attention as anyone.         
	And he is a joy to watch, with his mop of hair, an engaging smile and a fundamentally sound swing.         
	The youngest winner in the US PGA Tour history was Johnny McDermott, who was 19 years, 10 months and 17 days when he captured the 1911 US Open. McIlroy will be 19 years, nine months and 25 days on Sunday.

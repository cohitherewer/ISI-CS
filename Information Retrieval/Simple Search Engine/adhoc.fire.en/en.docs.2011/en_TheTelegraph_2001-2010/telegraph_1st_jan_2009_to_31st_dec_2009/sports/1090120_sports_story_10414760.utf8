                                                   Thakurs brace in India win 
                      
	Mar del Plata: Deepak Thakur scored a brace as India won 2-1 against Argentina in the first Test of the four-match series at the Panam National Stadium here on Monday.         
	The veteran striker sounded the boards on the 18th and 41st minutes, while Matias Paredes reduced the margin for Argentina in the 65th minute with a penalty corner deflection.         
	It was, however, the hosts who forced their first penalty corner as early as in the fourth minute but Indian goalkeeper Baljit Singh foiled Juan Ignacio Gilardis drag-flick. (PTI)

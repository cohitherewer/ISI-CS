The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Peerless city boy praised 
                                                   Peerless city boy praised 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: They were both electrifying on the court at the Flushing Meadows on Sunday. But unfortunately they were on the opposite sides of the court.         
	As Leander Paes and his Czech partner Lucas Dlouhy overcame the challenge of Mahesh Bhupathi and Bahamian Mark Knowles 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 in mens doubles final of the US Open, one wondered whether Leander proved a point to his former partner in the process.         
	Akhtar Ali didnt specify that but was of the view that much of the credit for Maheshs success in the sport must go to Leander. Leander picked up Bhupathi as a partner at a time when the latter was nobody So, credit must be given to Leander for that, he said.         
	Naresh Kumar, on the other hand, didnt agree that there was anything to prove for Leander. No, I dont think you can look at the match like that Leander and Dlouhy could have lost the match too as they were a set down. Moreover, they are so different as players. While Leander is basically a right court player, Bhupathi is a left court player. So, I think in that regard theres no real rivalry between them, he said.         
	Enrico Piperno echoed Nareshs view as he said: I dont think there is anything left for them to prove, even to each other. But of course they dont like to lose to each other. So that might be driving them in the match, he said.         
	But all three were unanimous in their praise for the 36-year-old Leander terming his 10th Grand Slam triumph as absolute magic.

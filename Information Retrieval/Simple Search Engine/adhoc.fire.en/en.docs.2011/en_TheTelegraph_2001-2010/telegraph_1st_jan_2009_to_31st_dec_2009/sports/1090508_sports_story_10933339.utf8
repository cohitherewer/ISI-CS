The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Steve backs Sourav to continue
                                                   Steve backs Sourav to continue
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly has found support from his one-time on-field rival Steve Waugh. The former Australia captain said on Thursday that the Kolkata Knight Riders, who are passing through a lean phase in the ongoing second edition of the Indian Premier League, still need Souravs services.         
	Asked whether the ex-India captain, who hasnt had an impressive tournament so far, should give up playing, Steve said: He is the best person to decide on his career. Its his choice when to stop, so he knows the best. I still think theres some good cricket left in him.         
	He has been there for quite a long time. He is a very valuable player of his franchise and the Knight Riders need him. Also, the people love him so much. I dont see a reason why he shouldnt play.         
	Steve also shrugged off the concept of multiple captaincy floated by the Knight Riders director of cricket operations John Buchanan.         
	Where is multiple captaincy? I dont see any. (Brendon) McCullum is the only leader on the field for the KKR. I think its only a theory. It wasnt practically applied.         
	Commenting on the Twenty20 format, the legendary Australian said that the format was already too complicated and more innovations were unnecessary.         
	T20 is too complicated. One must get his basics right to succeed in this format of the game. I dont think theres any need to do too much with T20, he said.         
	Introducing spin in the initial overs seems to be a nice move. It brings an element of surprise in the game.

	Calcutta: Top seed Sayantan Das of Scottish Collegiate School defeated Ankit K Singh of DAV School, Adityapur in the fourth round of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship, being presented by Himani Sona Chandi Chawyanprash and organised by Alekhine Chess Club, at Gorky Sadan on Friday.         
	At the end of the fourth round, 15 players shared the lead with four points apiece. The seeded players performed true to their billing.

	Sayan Majumder of Indira Gandhi Memorial High School put up a stiff resistance against third seeded Prince Bajaj of DPS (Ghaziabad) before faltering in the end-game.         
	Eleventh seeded Aditya Chakraborti of DPS (Ruby Park) was shocked by Rishav Mitra of Dum Dum Baidyanath Institute. Mitra shattered the kingside of Aditya and his monarch was caught in a net by the combined onslaught of Rishavs pieces.

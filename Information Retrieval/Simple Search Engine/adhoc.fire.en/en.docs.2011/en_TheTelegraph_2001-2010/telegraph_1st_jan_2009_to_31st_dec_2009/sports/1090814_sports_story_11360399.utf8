The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The mentor at work again
                                                   The mentor at work again
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly, the mentor, was at work once again at the Eden on Thursday.         
	From testing rookie pacer Pawan Sharma from Agra to helping batsmen Debabrata Das and Avik Chowdhury, the former Team India captain left no stone unturned in helping the youngsters of the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	While Debabrata was advised to tighten his batting grip for better shots, Ishank Jaggi and Avik Chowdhury were told to be aggressive in their approach in the shortest format of the game.         
	Bengal offie Sourashish Lahiri along with his Gujarat counterpart Mohnish Parmar bowled in tandem as the Kolkata Knight Riders had two practice sessions in the pre-season training camp which will conclude Friday.         
	It was learnt physio Andrew Leipus would sit with individual players Friday and analyse their progress. The former India physio will hand out fitness charts to the players.         
	The camp so far has been satisfactory. Once Ranji season begins, players will be busy. So it was important to assess everybodys fitness and rectify the mistakes. At the end of the camp we will give fitness chart to all the players and ask them to follow the chart. I am sure they will improve if they follow the regime, Leipus said.

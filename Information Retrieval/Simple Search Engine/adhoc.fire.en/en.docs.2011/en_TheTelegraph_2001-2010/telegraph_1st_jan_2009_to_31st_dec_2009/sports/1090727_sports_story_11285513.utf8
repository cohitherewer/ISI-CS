The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 4-wkt loss for Indians
                                                   4-wkt loss for Indians
                      
	Brisbane: Opener Ajinkya Rahanes well-made 92 went in vain as India slumped to a four-wicket defeat against South Africa in their fourth 50-over match of the Emerging Players Tournament here on Sunday.         
	Put in to bat, India made 271 for six, thanks mainly to Rahanes 120-ball innings, which included five fours and a six. Naman Ojha (48), captain S. Badrinath (44) and Abhishek Nayar (42) were the other notable contributors.         
	In reply, South Africa made 274 for six in 48.3 overs to win the match comfortably with three players  Stein van Zyl (60), Vaughn van Jaarsveld (50) and Farhaan Behardien (50)  scoring a half century each at the Albury Oval.         
	Bhuvneshwar Kumar was the pick of the Indian bowlers with figures of three for 39 while Pradeep Sangwan, Badrinath and Virat Kohli scalped one wicket each.         
	The Indians were in for a chance to win the match after they reduced South Africa to 56 for two, but the third wicket stand of 82 runs between Van Zyl and captain Van Jaarsveld changed the complexion of the game.         
	Then a 64-run fifth wicket partnership between Van Zyl and Behardien shut the door on the Indians, who had lost by 10 runs to the same opponents in their first 50-over match of the tournament on July 21.         
	Earlier, Rahane and Ojha shared a 100-run opening partnership to give India a solid start. They consolidated further with Rahane and Badrinath sharing a 86-run stand for the second wicket.

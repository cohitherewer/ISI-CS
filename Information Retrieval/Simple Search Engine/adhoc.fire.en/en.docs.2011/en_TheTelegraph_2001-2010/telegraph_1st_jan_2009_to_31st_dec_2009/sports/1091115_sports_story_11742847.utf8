                                                                                                                                   Salgaocar held by JCT

	Mumbai/Margao: Salgaocar and JCT played a goalless draw in an I-league match at Nehru Stadium here on Saturday.         
	Salgaocar now have seven points from as many matches, while JCT have taken their tally to 10 points from eight matches.         
	JCT showed urgency in their attack in the first half with Penn Orji orchestrating most of the moves.         
	The Punjab side came close to scoring twice but failed to beat keeper Kalyan Chaubey.         
	On the other hand, much was expected from Salagoacars new recruit Keita Mandjou but the Guyanese striker failed to impress and was replaced by Manjit Singh in the second half.         
	Keita had a chance to put the hosts ahead in the dying moments of the first half but shot wide.         
	Ekene Ikenwa also had a good opportunity to score midway in the first half but JCT goalkeeper Karanjit Singh was equal to the task.         
	Meanwhile, Mumbai FC will miss the services of defender E Anas due to a double booking when they take on Sporting Clube de Goa at the Cooperage in Mumbai on Sunday.         
	The back-to-back wins (over Mohun Bagan and JCT in the last two rounds) have given us the confidence, Mumbai FC coach Khalid Jamil said on Saturday.         
	The hosts are placed eighth in the standings with nine points while Sporting are yet to notch up a win and are last in the 14-team competition.

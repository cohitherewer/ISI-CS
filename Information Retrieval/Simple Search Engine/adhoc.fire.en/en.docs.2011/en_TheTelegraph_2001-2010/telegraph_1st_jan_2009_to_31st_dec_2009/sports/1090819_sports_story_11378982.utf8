  - First Test 
  -  Jayawardene leads charge with unbeaten century               Mahela Jayawardene plays a shot en route to an unbeaten 108 in Galle on Tuesday. (Reuters)                           
	Galle: Mahela Jayawardene scored an unbeaten century to put Sri Lanka on top as the hosts reached 293 for three at stumps on the opening day of the first Test against New Zealand on Tuesday.         
	Walking in to bat with his team looking vulnerable at 16 for two, Jayawardene first played a supporting role as a flamboyant Tillekaratne Dilshan went on the offensive, and later took the leading position, guiding Sri Lanka to a dominant position.         
	Dilshan was bowled by seamer Iain Brien for 92 after lunch in sight of his ninth Test hundred, hitting 12 fours and a six in 72 balls as he opened for the first time in Test cricket instead of the out-of-form Malintha Warnapura.         
	The start had been delayed by 90 minutes and the New Zealanders had reason to feel smug 40 minutes after winning the toss, but a rapid 118-run stand between Dilshan and Jayawardene quickly wiped the smiles off their faces.         
	I am really disappointed to get out at 92, Dilshan told reporters, but he said he had relished the opportunity of opening the batting.         
	Its much easier, there is no pressure, Dilshan said. Now I can play my own game. I feel much more comfortable batting at the top of the order.         
	The right-hander said he was under pressure after Sri Lanka lost quick wickets but his aggression put the pressure back on the Black Caps. He said the hosts were now looking to post a first-innings score of at least 450.         
	Jayawardenes approach was much less helter-skelter and far more measured.         
	There were the characteristically lovely drives through the covers and the beautiful late twirls of the wrist that sent the ball to thirdman, but there were also periods of dogged defence against the accurate left-arm spin of Daniel Vettori.         
	There was a period after tea when the former Sri Lanka captain appeared bereft of inspiration, but once he stepped out to off-drive Vettori for four, the fluency came surging back.         
	Jayawardene paired with Thilan Samaraweera in the best partnership of the day, an unbroken 159 runs for the fourth wicket.         
	Jayawardenes 108 not out was his 26th Test hundred that came off 217 balls in nearly five hours at the crease.         
	Martin was clipped through mid-wicket for four and when Brien dropped one short, an emphatic pull for four took Jayawardene to his 18th hundred on home soil, at the very venue where he had scored his first 11 years ago.         
	Samaraweera had been the perfect foil, taking time to play himself in and then playing some magnificent shots himself.         
	New Zealand had quietened things with a couple of maidens after tea, but Samaraweera released the pressure with three boundaries off Jeetan Patel  a cover-drive, a cut and a glorious back-foot punch.         
	Seam bowler Chris Martin returned the best bowling figures for the visitors, taking two for 59.         
	New Zealand captain Vettori sent Sri Lanka in to bat, hoping to generate some swing from a Galle pitch softened by heavy rain in the past few days.         
	Martin responded well to his captains plan, striking with his third delivery of the innings with the hosts yet to score, to have Tharanga Paranavitana caught behind.         
	Kumar Sangakkara made just eight before he was caught by Daniel Flynn at mid-wicket off Martin as the hosts were reduced to a precarious 16 for two.         
	Sri Lanka recalled spinner Ajantha Mendis for the match at the expense of left-arm spinnerer Rangana Herath.         
	Off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan and regular wicket-keeper Prasanna Jayawardena also returned to the side after injury layoffs.           (AGENCIES)

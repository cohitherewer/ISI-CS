The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | South Africa win ODI series 4-1
                                                   South Africa win ODI series 4-1
                      
	Perth: Australia were Friday dethroned as the No. 1 team in one-dayers by South Africa who defeated the hosts by 39 runs in the fifth and final match to clinch the ODI series by an emphatic 4-1 margin.         
	The ODI series triumph follows South Africas 2-1 win in the Test series and though Australia remain the No.1 team in the longer version of the game, the Proteas return home with their new-found tag of being the top team in one dayers.         
	Australia needed 289 runs for a win to remain the No.1 side but 249 was all they managed before folding in 49 overs with Michael Hussey (78) and Brad Haddin (63) making futile efforts with the bat.         
	Earlier, Hashim Amla (97) and AB de Villiers (60) steadied South Africa with a 118-run stand and then JP Duminy (60 not out off 42 balls) provided the late burst as South Africa posted 288 for six wickets.         
	Australia faltered early in the chase and could not really recover from the setbacks.         
	The hosts needed a strong start from Shaun Marsh (5) and David Warner (22) but debutant South African Lonwabo Tsotsobe rocked the Australian boat with early double-strikes and Ricky Pontings men could never really recover from that.         
	Tsotsobe removed Marsh in the second over while Warner ran himself out in the 13th. In between, Tsotsobe returned Ponting (12) and then Michael Clarke (0) dragged a Morne Morkel onto the stumps as Australia slumped to 53 for four inside 13 overs.         
	The subsequent 69 runs raised by the Hussey brothers did arrest the slide for a while but Duminy broke the stand by claiming David and Tsotsobe then castled Michael.         
	Haddin did try his best but it was too late. For South Africa, Tsotsobe made a memorable debut, scalping four wickets for 50 runs in his nine overs.         
	Earlier, after South Africa decided to bat first, Hashim Amla began with some early fours before guiding a Ben Hilfenhaus delivery over third man for a six.         
	The visitors had their share of early trouble as well. Hilfenhaus removed Herschelle Gibbs (7) and then James Hopes scalped Neil McKenzie (10), promoted to number three in Jacques Kalliss absence, as South Africa stuttered to 58 for two.

                                                   India to train in Spain 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Indian football team will travel to Spain in July for a training-cum-exposure tour, according to team sources.         
	The tour will mainly help the national team prepare for the Nehru Cup to be played in August, sources said. The Indians are expected to play a few practice matches against the lower division Spanish clubs.         
	The last two seasons, the Indian team went to Portugal in the summer for pre-season preparations. It helped them immensely as the team returned from their European sojourns to win the Nehru Cup in 2007 and then the AFC Challenge Cup last August.         
	The Indians are currently in Hong Kong to play a friendly against the hosts on Wednesday. On Monday, the team had an hour long practice session.         
	The good news for the Indians is that skipper Bhaichung Bhutia practised with the team and is likely to take the field against Hong Kong. Bhutia has been out of action since mid-December after he was injured in the Federation Cup.

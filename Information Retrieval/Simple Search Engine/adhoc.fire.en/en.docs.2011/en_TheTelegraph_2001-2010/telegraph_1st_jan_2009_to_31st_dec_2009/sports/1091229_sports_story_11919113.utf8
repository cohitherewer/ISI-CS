	Calcutta: The India A mens team completed their campaign by winning their final round match against Sri Lanka 4-0, in the Asian Team Chess Championship, at Town Hall on Monday. India A finished with an all-win record, gathering 14 match points in the meet organised by the Dibyendu Barua Chess Academy and All Sport Management.         
	Indias dominance in the mens section was complete as their nearest rivals, Vietnam and Iran, finished three points behind, each on 11 points. The Vietnam team, however, were awarded the silver on account of their better tie-breaking points while Iran had to be content with the bronze.         
	The Indians picked up three individual board prizes of the five on the anvil. K. Sasikiran, Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Parimarjan Negi won board prizes on the second, third and fourth boards respectively.         
	We had expected to win, as we had a strong team, Sasikiran, the Indian captain said.         
	In the womens section, Vietnam annexed the gold totalling 13 points. They outplayed tailenders Nepal 4-0, as expected, in the final round. India A, who had got the bye in the last round got only one point for the bye and ended on 10 points to take silver. India B squandered an excellent opportunity to grab the silver and went down unexpectedly to Iran to finish the championship on nine points         
	Amongst the girls, Dranavalli Harik of India won the top board individual gold while Paridar Shadi of Iran won the second board prize.         
	It was a pleasant surprise for the Indian mens team to learn that they had qualified, by default, for the World Team Chess Championship, in Bursa, Turkey, from January 3-14, winning this tournament. India made the cut as the Asia continental champions withdrew at the last minute.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | FIH has security concerns
                                                   FIH has security concerns
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The International Hockey Federation (FIH) is monitoring the security situation in India with a hawks eye.         
	India has been allotted the World Cup next year but with the subcontinent vulnerable to terrorism like never before, the FIH has enough reason to be cautious.         
	The FIH communications manager Arjen Meijer said on Monday that the parent body of world hockey is quite disturbed over the recent developments in the subcontinent.         
	The FIH is monitoring the situation carefully, the FIH official said.         
	The developments in the subcontinent are worrying the FIH, especially because they have nothing to do with sports and are completely out of control of all parties involved in the 2010 FIH World Cup.         
	Meijer said that a delegation of FIH officials has already made two visits to India in 2009 and would continue to do so throughout the year.         
	He also made it clear that the championship will only be held once the FIH is satisfied with the security measures in India. You can be sure that only if the FIH and the local organisers guarantee the security of players, coaches, officials, spectators and all others involved for 100%, a FIH world level event can be organised, the official said.         
	Senior IOA official A.K. Mattoo said that he was confident the World Cup would be smoothly staged. There are adequate steps for the smooth conduct of the World Cup. The security concerns would also be addressed in a proper manner, Mattoo commented.

                                                   CAB likely to debar 3 officials
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) working committee is likely to debar former joint secretaries Samar Paul and Amitava Banerjee along with treasurer Tushar Sarkar from the association for misusing funds during the first edition of the IPL.         
	The special general meeting on Saturday, which lasted for almost two hours, decided to refer the matter to the working committee which will take necessary action based on the observation and recommendations made by the special committee.         
	Paul and Sarkar were present at the meeting, while Banerjee stayed away.         
	The committee, in its report, stated that Banerjee had explained that this being the first time that the IPL was being organised, the then office bearers had no experience of staging such an event, where seven matches had to be hosted in a span of 35 days. Banerjee stated that the excess expenses could have perhaps been avoided but the CAB management was more concerned about organising the tournament successfully.         
	Of the Rs 8.26 crore spent, Red Chillies has reimbursed Rs 3.5 crore and the problem is with the remaining Rs 4.76 crore. It was decided that the association would drop its claim of Rs 4.76 crore and would request the BCCI to release Rs 10 crore, due from TV rights.

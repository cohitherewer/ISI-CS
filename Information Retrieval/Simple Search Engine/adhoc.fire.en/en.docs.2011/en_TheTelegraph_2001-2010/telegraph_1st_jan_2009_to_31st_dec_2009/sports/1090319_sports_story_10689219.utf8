The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Beckham linked with Real return
                                                   Beckham linked with Real return
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Real Madrid are planning to hijack AC Milans timeshare deal with LA Galaxy by paying the Major League Soccer (MLS) club 10 million, if Florentino Perez becomes president, says a report in The Sun.         
	Currently, a deal is in place between the Rossoneri and Galaxy for Beckham to stay at the San Siro until the end of the season.         
	Beckhams loan deal from the MLS side was due to end on March 9, with Milans home game against Atalanta scheduled to be his last in the red and black shirt.         
	However, on March 8 Beckham released a statement through Galaxy confirming the Milan deal, which followed weeks of negotiations between the two clubs and the MLS.         
	The agreement means Beckham will miss at least 17 games of this years MLS season, while his return to the United States now looks set to be on July 18 at the New York Red Bulls.         
	However, there also remains the possibility that Milan and Galaxy could come to some sort of permanent agreement at the end of this years Italian season.         
	That idea, though, has taken a new twist following Reals interest.         
	Perez is a big fan of Beckhams  he was the man who bought the midfielder from Manchester United for 24m in 2003  and he is favourite to win next summers presidential elections at the Bernabeu.         
	A Madrid source told the Sun: Florentino will try to bring Becks back if he runs for the presidency.         
	Meanwhile, former Real president Ramon Calderon has once again risked the wrath of Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson by claiming Cristiano Ronaldo will sign for the Spanish champions this summer.         
	Calderon said: Thanks to the work Ive done, hell join when this season ends.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ricky puts country before IPL
                                                     Ricky puts country before IPL
            A STAFF REPORTER            Ricky Ponting                           
	Calcutta: Ricky Ponting on Thursday announced that he will skip this years Indian Premier League (IPL), starting April 10, to concentrate on national commitments. The Australian captain is contracted with the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	I have made the decision I will not play in the IPL Twenty20 competition this year. My country comes first and there was no way I could give my all for Australia if I used the only two-week break we have to go and play in India, Ponting wrote in his column in The Australian.         
	I have been talking with my team, the Kolkata Knight Riders for a month or two now, and in the end my only choice was to withdraw from the 2009 competition, but I will most certainly be back for 2010 when I hope to be able to make a much greater contribution. The franchise has been fantastic about the whole thing and I want to thank them for their understanding, he wrote.         
	Ponting is currently in South Africa with the Australian squad for a Test and one-day series.         
	Joy Bhattacharya, chief executive officer of Knight Riders, said while they respected Pontings wishes, they would seek a replacement for the Australian captain.         
	Hes a great player. We respect his wishes We had left it entirely on him to decide on the issue We are looking forward to having him on board next season, Bhattacharya said.         
	Ponting said part of his decision not to play in the IPL this year was that Twenty20 cricket was physically demanding and he wanted to preserve himself for the World Cup in England in June.         
	I could have played for two free weeks in the IPL and in many ways that is not satisfactory, not for the Knight Riders and not for Australian cricket either.         
	And then there was the issue of giving up the chance to be with my family for a fortnight. It is always hard to leave Rianna and I cherish every second I spend with my daughter Emmy.         
	Having said that, it will be painful not to be with the Knight Riders and I am going to be sneaking out in the night to catch as many of their matches as I can on the television.         
	All of us in the Australian dressing room have said that this has been our toughest summer. Obviously our priorities are to be in the best physical and mental shape we can be for the Australian side and it doesnt get any more important than the games weve got coming up.         
	We have something to prove to the South Africans and the world. After that it is the ICC World Twenty20 championship and then we have the Ashes. And nobody needs to be told how much that matters.         
	In that sense it was not that tough a decision. But in saying that, everybody who has played in the IPL enjoyed the experience and everybody in cricket wants to be part of the tournament. It is the new frontier to some degree and an exciting frontier. However, when you weigh that up against being at your best for the series ahead it was an easy choice.         
	Before we go a step further, I want to say that this is not an indication of any intention to ease myself out of Twenty20 cricket. I am really looking forward to the World Cup. Its one trophy we do not have on the shelf and have never had.         
	Part of the reason I decided to withdraw from the IPL is that Twenty20 is such a physically demanding game and you have to be at your best to play the game and I want to be at my best for the World Cup, he wrote.         
	In conclusion, Ponting did not forget his commitments for next season. I havent looked ahead to next year but it would be perfect if I could get over and play every game with the Knight Riders.         
	The IPL is one of the most exciting competitions in world cricket and I wouldnt mind getting my hands on that trophy too, but until then it is the trophy cabinet at Cricket Australia that matters the most.

	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan, unlike arch-rivals East Bengal, began their IFA Shield campaign on a convincing note drubbing George Telegraph 4-0 at their home ground on Friday.         
	Edeh Chidi, the Nigerian recruit from Mahindra United who played his debut match for the club, scored two of the four goals in the first half. He would have had a hattrick under his belt, had he not missed a penalty in the 20th minute.         
	The first goal came even before the spectators could settle down. George Telegraph goalkeeper Sibram Dey failed to gather a James Singh freekick and the opportunist Chidi, who was at the right place at the right time, tapped it home. His second came in the 39th minute when he received a ball at the centre of the park and saw Dey out of position. He unleashed booming volley which hit the back of the net, leaving Dey stunned.         
	The green and maroon brigade were up 3-0, when James Singhs header from a Marcos Pereira corner nestled into the net. The home teams defence looked shaky at times but George Telegraph could not capitalise. In the second half, Mohun Bagan goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee was kept busy. George Telegraphs Abiola and Pintu Prasad missed chances that could have reduced the margin.         
	In the 86th minute, Mohun Bagan got their fourth, thanks to Marcoss substitute, Subho Kumar. Subhos 35-yard volley crashed into the net and the rout was complete.         
	I really cant ask for more, a beaming Karim after the drubbing. The biggest challenge now is to keep this momentum going, not only for the next match but the whole season.         
	The margin is the biggest in the ongoing Shield but the Moroccan coach didnt seem very excited. Well see how the match against Mahindra goes, he said.

	Calcutta: National selector and former India leg-spinner Narendra Hirwani dropped in at Eden Gardens on Wednesday to watch Bengals Super League Ranji Trophy encounter against Baroda. Hirwani will be present on the next three days, too.         
	Its always nice to be back in Calcutta. I have fond memories, having played Ranji Trophy here. It was nice to catch up with Sourav (Ganguly) after quite some time. I also chatted with Irfan for some time, Hirwani said.         
	However, he clarified that he is not in a position to talk about selection matters. We are bound by a code of conduct which doesnt allow me to express my views.         
	Hirwani will definitely keep a close watch on Irfan Pathan, who had a mixed day with the ball.         
	Among the other selectors, Yashpal Sharma is watching the Madhya Pradeshs Plate League match against Kerala in Indore. Sreesanth, who has made a comeback to the Test squad, is playing the match and has taken one wicket for 58 in MPs first innings.         
	Raja Venkat is supposed to watch Mumbais next match against Himachal Pradesh.

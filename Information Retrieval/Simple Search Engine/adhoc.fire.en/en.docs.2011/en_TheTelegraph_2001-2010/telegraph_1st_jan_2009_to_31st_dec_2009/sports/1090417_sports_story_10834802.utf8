	Monte Carlo: Roger Federer suffered an embarrassing third-round exit at the Monte Carlo Masters on Thursday when he went down 6-4, 7-5 to fellow Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka.         
	The duo are close friends and captured the Olympic doubles title together in Beijing but on Thursday Wawrinka was in no mood to be charitable towards his more celebrated countryman.         
	However, once the 13th seed had sealed his first career win over Federer, his celebrations were rather muted.         
	Wawrinka will face Andreas Beck for a place in the last four after the German qualifier beat Argentine Juan Monaco 3-6 6-2 7-5.         
	Second seed Federer, who has not won a single title this year, struggled with his serve and Wawrinka snatched a break on his sixth attempt in the seventh game. He wrapped the opening set as the 13-time Grand Slam winner netted an easy forehand.         
	Federer dropped serve in the first game of the second set but broke straight back, charging to the net to save another break point at 3-3. Federer was under pressure again in the 11th game and found himself with his back to the wall after sending yet another forehand wide as Wawrinka was serving for the match.         
	Spains Fernando Verdasco beat David Ferrer 6-2, 6-1.         
	Earlier, on Wednesday, Leander Paes and his partner Lukas Dlouhy entered the quarter finals defeating unseeded Spaniard duo of Albert Montanes and Tommy Robredo in a match tie-breaker.         
	The third seed Indo-Czech pair had to stretch themselves to the limit to beat Montanes and Robredo 2-6, 7-6 (7-5), 10-8 in the third round.         
	Paes and Dlouhy will next face seventh seeds Julian Knowle of Austria and Andy Ram of Israel. The combination of Knowle-Ram defeated Simon Aspelin of Sweden and South African Wesley Moodie 7-6 (7-3), 6-2.

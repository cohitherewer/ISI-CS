The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mohun Bagan count on experience today
                                                   Mohun Bagan count on experience today
            A STAFF REPORTER    
	Calcutta: Laurand Banide, Al Kuwait SCs head coach, claims he has worked with French soccer stars Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet during his stint as the academy coach of French club AS Monaco. Well, thats certainly an enviable achievement. But when Mohun Bagan lock horns with the Kuwaiti side in a third round encounter of the AFC Cup on Tuesday, it will the home team that will be enjoying a slim advantage.         
	Both teams had brief practice sessions at the venue, Howrah Stadium, on Monday. Interestingly, it was noticed there were no foreign players in the Kuwaiti side. Moreover, an official from the club revealed that their squad comprised mainly under-19 players. The inference that can be drawn from this is that the 10-time Kuwait Premier League champions are not considering Mohun Bagan a mountain.         
	While having youngsters in the side can prove a boon because they sure add an extra bit of pace, the inexperience may turn out to be a spoiler for the visitors.         
	According to Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa, goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee is suffering from viral fever and defender N.S. Manju has a hamstring injury. He expressed doubt over the availability of both for the game. But knowing the Bagan coach and how he likes to hide his strategies before a match, both may actually play an active part on Tuesday. In fact, both attended the full practice session on Monday.         
	The green and maroon brigade spent considerable time practising crosses from the wings. The purpose behind the move was understandable since the average height of the Kuwaiti side is certainly not a commanding one. So, aerial balls may be a good way to break the visitors defence.Jose Ramirez Barreto and Bhaichung Bhutia should be the favoured strike pair for Bagan, although, according to Karim, the Brazilian striker has still not recovered from a throat infection.         
	The Moroccan will have his first choice defenders  Peter Odafa, Deepak Mondal, Habibur Rahman Mondol and Manju  available for selection. L. James Singh, Marcos Pereira, Rakesh Masih and Ishfaq Ahmed will probably man the midfield.         
	Al Kuwait SC appeared quite a nippy side at practice. They concentrated mostly on playing short ground passes and were changing positions fast. Their pace suggests they will be quite a handful in counter attacks.         
	But given that Bagan have a full side at their disposal, it will be interesting to find out how the young guns from Kuwait handle the experience of Bencharifas boys.While Bagan have lost both their matches in the tournament so far to be placed at the bottom of group D, Al Kuwait currently share the lead with Al Wehdat of Jordan.

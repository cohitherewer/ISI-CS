The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chetri is on Celtic radar
                                                     Chetri is on Celtic radar
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Sunil Chetri                           
	New Delhi: Sunil Chetri, who struck the only goal in Indias 1-0 win over FC Santboia in Barcelona on Wednesday, could be called for trials by Scottish Premier League giants Celtic Football Club.         
	According to sources in the national team, which will travel back to India on Friday, scouts from the famed Scottish club visited Barcelona early this week to have a look at the Indian forward.         
	The recruiters are believed to have been happy with Chetris performance at the national camp and will take a final decision on the Indian player after returning to Glasgow. Celtic, winners of 42 Scottish Premier league title, are one of the biggest clubs in Scotland.         
	Chetris agent, Yogesh Josee, who was also in Barcelona, however, said one should not make too much of it.         
	Its true that scouts from Celtic have watched Chetri but I havent got any feedback from them yet.         
	For the moment, it is too premature to link Sunil with Celtic. But then, Celtic are not the only option that Sunil has, Josee said.         
	Chetri, who has signed for Goas Dempo this season, scored a hattrick in India s victory over Tajikistan in the AFC Challenge Cup final last year.         
	Chetri has just recovered from an injury picked up during the I-League last season and aggravated during the Santosh Trophy campaign for Delhi.         
	In January this year, Chetri had gone for trials with English Championship club Coventry City but wasnt signed by the Midlands club.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhonis hungry for   more
                                                     Dhonis hungry for   more
                  Jayasuriya                           
	Dambulla: Mahendra Singh Dhoni wants more from his team despite a comfortable win in the first one-day International against Sri Lanka here Wednesday.         
	It could have been better, Dhoni said adding that the Indian top-order had chipped in with satisfactory performances. We lost a few (wickets) in the middle but Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina and myself all came good in the end, the Indian captain, whose unbeaten 61 off 65 balls guided his team to a six-wicket win, said.         
	India, chasing Sri Lankas modest 246, were largely helped by the 113-run stand between Gambhir and Raina for the second wicket.         
	Dhoni said Sanath Jayasuriya, who won the Man of the Match award for his 28th ODI hundred, showed signs of tiring and his ploy was to wear him down by taking the pace off the ball.         
	I wanted him to try and force it than giving him the chance to use the pace of the ball, Dhoni said giving reasons for his opting to part-time bowlers in the middle-overs.         
	He, however, felt Indian bowlers could have still done better. Maybe we could have done a bit better with bowling, he added.         
	On the timing of powerplays, Dhoni said it was tricky to judge that.         
	Its actually tricky, especially when you are chasing. If you take it in 38th or 40th over you can still get 60-70 runs easily. But its important to get the initial breakthroughs. Even if we were bowling second it could have been a tricky thing for us, Dhoni said.         
	Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene, whose dreadful run of low scores continued when he was dismissed for a scratchy 11 off 27 balls, did not feel the target set was low. The way we have been playing of late has changed and we will continue with that, he said.         
	I give credit to our guys because it was not an easy wicket but it probably slowed down later on and so was good to score runs, he said.         
	We lost out two guys who were settled during the powerplays. But the Indians batted well. They kept the pressure on us through there batting as well as bowling, he added.         
	The Sri Lanka skipper also said they were under no pressure to perform. There was no pressure to take wickets but we could not bowl them out, he felt.         
	Indians did not panic in their chase, we couldnt keep up the pressure, he added.         
	The slow nature of the pitch did not help either, the Sri Lankan captain said adding that there was no sideways movement for the Sri Lankan quicks.         
	Sri Lankas famed spin twins, Muttiah Muralidharan and Ajantha Mendis conceded nearly a 100 runs between them for Muralis solitary wicket. This meant the Sri Lankan off-spinner is still short of 2 more scalps to go past the former Pakistani great Wasim Akram as the worlds highest ODI wicket-taker.         
	Jayasuriya felt that his team fell short by 25-30 runs. The wicket got easier gradually and Indian players batted well  the openers and Dhoni, Jayasuriya said.         
	We were short of 25-30 runs. We had upperhand in the start but we got stuck when the spinners came in, he said.         
	The veteran batsman, who became the oldest cricketer to score an ODI century, said they needed to put pressure on the Indian team.         
	We should have put more pressure on Indian spinners and also on their batsmen, he said. (PTI)

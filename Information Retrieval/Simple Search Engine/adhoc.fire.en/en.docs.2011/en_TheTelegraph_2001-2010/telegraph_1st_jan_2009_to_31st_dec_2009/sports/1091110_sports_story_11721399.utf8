	Calcutta: Bengal will have to play out of their skins when they take on an experienced and balanced Baroda team in the Ranji Trophy Super League match at the Eden from Tuesday.         
	Bengals five points in their opener in Pune had come against a young Maharashtra side, struggling to cope with the demands and pressures of first-class cricket. Moreover, Bengal, this time, will be without four of their key players  Manoj Tiwary, Wriddhiman Saha and Ashok Dinda will be doing duty for Board Presidents XI against Sri Lanka in Mumbai, while Rohan Gavaskar has been ruled out because of a groin injury.         
	The return of Sourav Ganguly will boost the players confidence, but as the former India captain admitted, his presence shouldnt raise expectations. More than being a battle between Sourav and the Pathan brothers, it will pit Baroda coach Paras Mhambrey against a side whose nucleus was formed during his tenure as Bengal coach three seasons ago.         
	Paras knows us inside out May be we will have to think out of the box, said Deep Dasgupta, who led Bengal during Mhambreys reign.         
	Mhambrey, though, is not reading much into it. Its true that I know them well, but they also know my methods and tactics. I dont think it will give any of us an advantage. At the end of the day, you will have to perform on the given day.         
	Roger Binny, too, feels Paras knowledge about Bengal wont be a major worry. Every match is recorded these days and its not a problem to watch a team or player closely. So even without being associated with a side, you can be aware of their positives, explained the Bengal coach.         
	Bengal are aware that the Pathan brothers can tilt the scales with their all-round display. They are definitely good players. But stars dont matter and it all boils down to performance, said captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla.         
	Were aware of the strengths and weaknesses of the Pathan brothers, said Binny. Baroda, on the other hand, are drawing strength from their presence.         
	The wicket, with a fair sprinkling of grass, is sure to provide lateral movement in the first session. That has probably led the Bengal think-tank to include rookie Sayan Sekhar Mondal in the playing XI. Sayan, who is from Durgapur, was CABs best under-19 cricketer last season.         
	Sourav will bat at No.5, while Arindam Ghosh will fill up the No. 4 slot. Baroda managed just one point from their opener and will be further handicapped by the absence of left-arm spinner Rajesh Pawar, one of the three bowlers hauled up for suspect action. But the grass on the wicket has prompted Baroda to delay naming their side. However, it remains to be seen how much of the grass is retained before the start.         
	TEAMS         
	Bengal (likely): Deep Dasgupta, Arindam Das, Avishek Jhunjhunwala, Arindam Ghosh, Sourav Ganguly, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Dibyendu Chakraborty, Sourashish Lahiri, Sourav Sarkar, Ranadeb Bose, Sayan Sekhar Mondal.         
	Baroda (from): Connor Williams, Pinal Shah, Satyajit Parab, Azhar Bilakhia, Jacob Martin, Irfan Pathan, Yusuf Pathan, Rakesh Solanki, Murtuja Vahora, Ajitesh Argal, Swapnil Singh, Shatrunjay Gaekwad, Ketan Panchal, Firdaush Bhaja, Bhargav Bhatt.         
	Match starts: 9 am.

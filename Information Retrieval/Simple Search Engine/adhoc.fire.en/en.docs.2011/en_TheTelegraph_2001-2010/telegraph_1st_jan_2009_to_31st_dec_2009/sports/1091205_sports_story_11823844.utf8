The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I am an entertainer, says Sehwag
                                                                                                                       7                                        I am an entertainer, says Sehwag
  - Opener not disappointed at missing out on world record         OUR CORRESPONDENT            Virender Sehwag after being dismissed on the third day of the third Test vs Sri Lanka, in Mumbai, on Friday. (AP)                                 
	Mumbai: Virender Sehwag said in the press conference on Friday that he was not disappointed about missing out on a record-breaking third triple century, in the third Test against Sri Lanka.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Missing out on 300         
	Im very happy that I got at least 293 runs. Its also a record of sorts. After scoring two triple hundreds, I have scored 290. Nobody has done that.         
	If he is a little disappointed         
	No. Think Im the luckiest. I missed the opportunity but there is always next time.         
	If he was tired         
	Mentally a bit, but physically okay. I had a spasm in the back but Nitin Patel (physio) and Ramesh Mane (masseur) did a very good job.         
	Comparing this innings to the triple hundreds in Multan and Chennai         
	Yesterday (Thursday) was just my day. Its hard for me to compare. Probably, you are the ones who should describe.         
	How would he rate this innings         
	My third best knock, after the two triple hundreds.         
	Changes made to his batting         
	In Ahmedabad, I had a chat with coach Gary Kirsten. He said: If you survive the new ball, you can score big, and you know you can score big. So I tried to see through the first 30-40 minutes.         
	On him being compared to Viv Richards         
	Its a great honour.         
	How would he classify himself         
	I am an entertainer.         
	If a batsman should always be an entertainer         
	It depends on the individual.         
	The difference in him between Thursday and Friday         
	There was no difference. I still tried to rotate the strike, and take my singles. I misjudged the length of that ball (which got him out). I tried to play it to mid-on and ended up giving a catch back to (Muttiah) Muralidharan.         
	The way he spent Thursday night         
	I was replying to messages.         
	Familys reaction to the great innings         
	They were really enjoying my innings. My son kissed the TV.         
	Souvenirs of his best performances         
	I have all of them except the first triple hundred bat, which I gave someone.         
	Dhonis century         
	Its one of the best by a wicket-keeper or lower-order batsman. Everyone knows he can hit sixes and he capitalised on his sixes.         
	If the declaration was delayed         
	We still have two days to go, man. We planned to give them (a target of 350), ended up a little less.         
	Sri Lankas second innings         
	They are a good side. We dismissed them for 400 in the first innings, hope we can do the same in the second. But our bowlers have a lot of hard work to do. The Dhoni-Ojha partnership shows that you can still bat on this wicket.         
	Advice to the youngsters         
	Try to bat and utilise the full day. Tomorrow is always a new day, you never know how it would turn out to be. If you spend a couple of hours at the crease, try and make the most of it. Yesterday (Thursday) I was brilliant, today (Friday) I just got nine runs.

                                                     Surgery on   Sahas left thumb
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta: Bengal keeper Wriddhiman Saha, an India probable for the World T20 meet in June, underwent surgery on his left thumb in Bloemfontein, late on Monday.         
	Saha got injured while batting during the Kolkata Knight Riders practice session earlier in the day and was immediately rushed to the Rosepark Hospital.         
	The doctor is optimistic However, at this stage, we are not sure whether Saha is out only for two-three weeks or if he will have to miss the IPLs second edition In fact, we may not have a clear idea for the next week or so Its very disappointing, cricket manager John Buchanan told The Telegraph close to midnight (IST).         
	Fortunately, South Africas Morne van Wyk is one of the Knights and, so, a specialist wicket-keeper will not be missed in Tuesdays warm-up matches against Free State.         
	Brendon McCullum, the other keeper, is still in New Zealand doing national duty.

	Centurion: Desperate to end their 11-year title drought in ICC events, South Africa would look to exploit home conditions and start on a winning note when they take on Sri Lanka in Champions Trophy opener here Tuesday.         
	Graeme Smiths side, who dethroned Australia from the top spot in the ODI rankings, would want to ensure that they do not have a false start in a tournament which they won in 1998 when they beat West Indies in Bangladesh.         
	Since then, South Africa havent even managed to make the final of an ICC tournament. Their World Cup woes have earned them the tag of chokers and their Champions Trophy record has done nothing to erase that label.         
	But after a brilliant season last year, the Proteas are confident of being third time lucky at home after failing to win the 50-over World Cup in 2003 and World Twenty20 in 2007.         
	No South African was named in the shortlist of this years ICC awards and captain Smith and coach Mickey Arthur have said they would want to do well in the Champions Trophy to get over that disappointment.         
	Sri Lanka, on the other hand, would also want to make a winning start in a tournament which they had won jointly with India at home in 2002. Moreover, they will get another chance to show that they do not always struggle on the bouncy tracks in South Africa and Australia.         
	South Africa, though, will be without hard-hitting opener Herschelle Gibbs, who suffered a rib injury in their warm-up game against the West Indies on Friday.         
	The likes of Smith, AB de Villiers, Jean-Paul Duminy and Jacques Kallis were in fine form last season but they will have to ensure that there is no rustiness in their first international match after the World Twenty20 in June.         
	In the bowling department, pacer Wayne Parnell and left-arm spinner Roelof van der Merwe will have to show that their fine performance in the World Twenty20 was no fluke.         
	Sri Lanka does not have any injury problems. They will be bolstered by the return of Muttiah Muralidharan who did not play in the Compaq Cup tri-series due to an injury. Kumar Sangakkaras men will depend on senior players like the captain himself, Sanath Jayasuriya, Mahela Jayawardene and Tillekaratne Dilshan to give them a good total when batting. Young batsman Thilina Kandamby would also be expected to chip in.

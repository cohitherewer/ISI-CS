The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan train gun on AIFF
                                                   Bagan train gun on AIFF
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Mohun Bagan-Bhaichung Bhutia row took a turn on Tuesday when the Bagan secretary questioned the All India Football Federations (AIFF) decision to appoint an arbitrator to resolve the issue.         
	Sources said that Mohun Bagan were yet to make their written submission to the arbitrator, Amarendra Sharan despite being asked to do it by Tuesday. Bhutias counsel has already made the submission.         
	The arbitrator is likely to announce his decision on this issue this week.         
	Mitra refused to confirm when the clubs reply will be filed. Our lawyers are looking into that issue, he said. However, there are indications that Mohun Bagan may ask for more time to make their written submission.         
	Training his gun on the AIFF, Mitra said: The AIFF executive committee meeting on August 30 took the decision that a legal opinion will be taken in the Bhaichung matter. Ask any member of the executive committee whether they had decided to refer the matter to the arbitrator.         
	There was no option to refer the matter to the arbitrator. A decision on the issue has already been taken by the AIFF and they are just acting by referring the matter to the arbitrator. They (AIFF) have already pre-fixed a decision, clamed the Bagan secretary.         
	Bhutia was suspended for six months without pay by Mohun Bagan in June for missing a few team training sessions and an exhibition match in Jalpaiguri.         
	He appealed to the Indian Football Association (IFA)) but later the AIFF took up the matter. The national bodys players status committee, however, failed to decide on the matter as one of the members refused to give his opinion.         
	The AIFF then asked its outgoing general secretary Alberto Colaco to mediate between the two warring parties.         
	After Colaco failed to come out with a solution, the AIFF executive committee in its meeting on August 30 had decided to refer the matter to an arbitrator.

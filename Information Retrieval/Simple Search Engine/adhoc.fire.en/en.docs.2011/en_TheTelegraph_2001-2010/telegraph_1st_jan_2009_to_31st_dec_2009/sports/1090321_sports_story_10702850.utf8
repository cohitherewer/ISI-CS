The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murray sets up Federer date
                                                     Murray sets up Federer date
                  Andy Murray                     
	Indian Wells: Andy Murray spoiled Croat Ivan Ljubicics 30th birthday with a 7-5, 7-6 victory on Thursday to advance to the semi-finals of the ATP event in Indian Wells.         
	The British world No. 4 forced a baseline error from his big-serving opponent with a booming forehand down the line to take the tie-break 8-6 and wrap up victory in just over two hours.         
	Murray next meets second seed and triple champion Roger Federer, who fended off a late challenge by 10th-seeded Spaniard Fernando Verdasco to triumph 6-3, 7-6 in the evening match at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden. After exchanging early breaks of serve in breezy conditions on the stadium court, Murray again broke Ljubicic in the 11th game before winning the first set in 52 minutes.         
	The Scot held the initiative in the second set and served for the match at 5-4 after 74th-ranked Ljubicic was again broken after a mistimed backhand sailed wide.         
	Although Murray failed to hold, netting a forehand as the score reached 5-5, he finished the tie-break strongly to stretch his win-loss record this season to 19-1.         
	Federer, competing in his first event since losing last months Australian Open final to Rafael Nadal, broke left-hander Verdasco in the fifth and ninth games to sweep through the opening set in 29 minutes.         
	The Swiss world No. 2 charged 4-1 up in the second before suddenly becoming vulnerable on his own serve, being broken in the seventh and 11th games to trail 5-6.         
	However, the Spanish world No. 10 failed to serve out to claim the set and Federer then squeezed through the tie-break 7-5 to book his place in the last four.         
	I played well for one-and-a-half sets and then Fernando made the whole match get a little tight, Federer said after saving two set points in the 12th game to beat the Spaniard for a third time in their three career meetings.         
	Champion Ana Ivanovic, meanwhile, reached the semi-finals of the WTA event with a walkover on Thursday after Austrias Sybille Bammer pulled out because of an injured left shoulder.         
	Bammer, the 23rd seed, had been due to play fifth-seeded Serb Ivanovic later in the day in the last of the womens quarter finals at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden.World No. 7 Ivanovic will meet Russian teenager Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the last four.

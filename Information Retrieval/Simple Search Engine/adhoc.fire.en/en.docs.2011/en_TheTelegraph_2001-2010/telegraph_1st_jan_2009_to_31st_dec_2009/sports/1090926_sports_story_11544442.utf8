The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Senior pros hold the key: Shoaib
                                                   Senior pros hold the key: Shoaib
                      
	Karachi: Controversial fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar feels that the result of Saturdays Champions Trophy clash between arch rivals India and Pakistan would depend on the performance of senior players like Sachin Tendulkar and Mohammed Yousuf from both sides.         
	Big players like Tendulkar and Yousuf are great because they perform in the big events. Tomorrow (Saturday) they would be under a lot of pressure and it would be a test of their experience and skills to see how they contribute for their teams, he said.         
	There is pressure on all the players because an Indo-Pak match is always a big event and every player wants to perform well and become an overnight hero. Such a match can turn a player into a hero or zero very quickly So the pressure and intensity levels are always high, he added.         
	Interestingly, Akhtar said he could sense internal problems in the Indian team ahead of the match.         
	I dont know But as a professional cricketer, I dont see the smoothness or closeness in the Indian team that was visible in the last few years, Akhtar said.         
	In the last few months, you can sense that things are not right in the Indian team, though I dont know the reasons for this, he told a television channel.         
	Akhtar, who played in the 2003 World Cup match against India at the Centurion, which Pakistan lost, predicted a high scoring match on Saturday.         
	The Centurion pitch is traditionally good for batting and helps the spinners as well. So I think the slow bowlers from both sides could play a decisive role, said Akhtar, who has been given permission by the Pakistan Cricket Board to appear in television shows.         
	Akhtar said pacer Mohammed Asif should be fielded against India despite the fact he has not played competitive cricket for last 16 months.         
	Asif should play. I dont care even if they have taken his dope test. The dope test results will come after a week. He is a match winner and if I was the captain, I would definitely gamble on him in such a high profile fixture.         
	He also advised the team management not to drop Yousuf if captain Younis Khan returns to the side after missing the first match.         
	Akhtar appealed to the Pakistani people and the media not to make match-fixing allegations even if Pakistan lose to India on the morrow.         
	No such thing happens in the team and such allegations only demoralise the team. One should just see how much effort and commitment the players have shown And even if they lose, the result must be accepted because in sports, one team has to lose.           (PTI)

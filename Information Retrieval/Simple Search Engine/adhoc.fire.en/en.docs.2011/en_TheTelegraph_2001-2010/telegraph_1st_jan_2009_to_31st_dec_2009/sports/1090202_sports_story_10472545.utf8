                                                   Dhoni: Spin duo still a threat
                      
	Colombo: Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni Sunday said that although his batsmen have done well to have not given wickets to Ajantha Mendis and Muttiah Muralidharan, they have yet to get the better of the spin twins in the ongoing one-day series against Sri Lanka.         
	Muralidharan and Mendis, who have enjoyed a good success rate against India in the past, have so far come a cropper in the five-match series which the Indians lead 2-0.         
	I wont say that our batsmen have got the better of the Sri Lankan spinners. There are still three more games to go.         
	They are not getting wickets, but at the same time they are not giving away too many runs, said Dhoni.         
	We are cautious and targeting other bowlers. We are happy that we are not giving wickets to the spinners, he added.         
	Dhoni also warned his teammates against getting complacent in the remaining matches. Dhoni said he expects a high level of commitment from all the team members in the remaining three matches.         
	It was tough and we did not have such a game for a long time. We have to be careful as such wins often make us relaxed. We should remember that the series is yet to be won.         
	We want to win the series and for that each of us has to give his 100 per cent, he had said after Indias 15-run victory here Saturday.         
	Although India is just a win away from pocketing the series, he said improvements were in order in some departments for the coming matches.         
	Todays (Saturday) game was a tough one during which we committed some mistakes which we would like to rectify before going for the next match.         
	We had couple of run outs. Besides, the bowlers should maintain line and length in the slog overs, he added.         
	Dhoni also admitted that he lost his cool when he found his bowlers clueless during the Powerplays in the middle of the Sri Lankan innings.         
	I lost my cool especially when bowlers got confused with the Powerplays.         
	I was not myself, especially in the second power play, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene Sunday said that Ajantha Mendiss lean patch against India is not of major concern to his side and insisted that the mystery spinner would rediscover his form before the five-match ODI series was over.         
	The Lankans trail 0-2 after losing the first match in Dambulla last Wednesday and the second here on Saturday, and Mendis had been uncharacteristically off-colour in both games.         
	He managed to pick just two wickets, conceding 91 runs in exchange.         
	But according to his captain there is nothing to be worried about.         
	We cannot ask a 23-year-old to pick four wickets in every game.         
	I am sure Ajantha will bounce back. It is not a huge concern for me, he said.         
	Mendis had scalped 19 wickets in the first six matches he played against India but has been struggling for form in the ongoing series.         
	Jayawardene admitted that the Indians have been playing Mendis well, but said that he feels the spinner will soon find a way to bamboozle them.         
	Right now, they are playing him well. Let him learn Let the batsmen also adjust themselves and then the bowlers try to change what they want to do. Thats how they learn, he said.

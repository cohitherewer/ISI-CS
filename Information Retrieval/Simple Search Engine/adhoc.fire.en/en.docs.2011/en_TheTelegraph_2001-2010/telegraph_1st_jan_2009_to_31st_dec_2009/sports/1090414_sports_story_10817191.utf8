                                                   Colts continue winning streak
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Harshal Patel snared three wickets before Mayank Agarwal and Avi Bharat struck half centuries to guide the Indian under-19 team to a nine-wicket win over their Australian counterparts in the first three-day cricket match at Bellerive Oval in Hobart on Monday.         
	The win gave the Indians an unassailable 1-0 lead in the two-match series. The next game will be played in Perth from April 19. In between, two teams will take on each other in the third and final one-dayer on April 17.         
	India had declared at 417 for seven to take a 111-run lead over Australia on Sunday. The hosts folded for 228 in the second innings, giving the Indians a target of 118, which they achieved in 18.4 overs.         
	Australian Mitchell Marsh went on to register his first century, scoring 109 but his teammates floundered with seven of the Aussies not even reaching double figures.         
	Although disappointed with the loss, Marsh noted it was a consolation to score a hundred. It was obviously good to get a few runs, just a shame we couldnt get a few more on the board and really put some presure on them, Marsh said.

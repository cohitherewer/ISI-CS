The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pak bars players from the IPL
                                                     Pak bars players from the IPL
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                
	New Delhi: Pakistan on Monday barred its cricketers from playing in the cash-rich Indian Premier League (IPL), fearing that it would be unsafe for the players to travel to India in view of the tense relations between the two countries.         
	The decision to deny permission came just four days before the IPL players auction in Goa and could further strain sporting ties between the two countries.         
	Saleem Altaf, the chief operating officer of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said they had received copy of a letter from the foreign affairs ministry sent to the sports ministry which declined permission to the players to travel to India for the Twenty20 tournament.         
	All the players who are already signed up with the IPL teams or those who were due to take part in the players auction have been declined permission, Altaf said in Karachi.         
	Altaf said the sports ministry had said they had no objection to the cricketers going to India.         
	In a hurriedly convened press conference here after the PCBs decision, Lalit Modi, chairman of the IPL, said the affected franchises would be allowed to spend the money to recruit fresh players.         
	Five Pakistan cricketers  Yasir Hameed, Yasir Arafat, Asim Kamal, Danish Kaneria and Mohammed Hafeez  were due to appear in the auction in Goa. Those already contracted with the franchises are  Younis Khan and Sohail Tanvir (Rajasthan Royals), Shoaib Malik (Delhi DareDevils), Shahid Afridi (Deccan Chargers) and Umar Gul (Kolkata Knight Riders).         
	After the auction on Friday, the teams who had Pakistan players would be allowed to spend the same amount to get replacement players of their own choice, the IPL chairman said.         
	The Pakistan government took this decision along with the PCB. So we have decided to withdraw all the five players from the auction in Goa, Modi said.         
	The Pakistani players have a three-year contract with their respective franchises and the only reason of their unavailability could be injuries. But since that is not the case here, we will have to look at the legal aspect of the issue, Modi added.         
	As per the guidelines set by the governing council for the IPL, each franchisee will have a maximum purse of $2 million, less any amount spent on signing temporary replacements from last year, to select the cricketers best suited for their teams strategies, the BCCI vice president added.         
	The IPL chairman said the final schedule of matches was yet to be drawn as there could be some changes because of the forthcoming general elections but confirmed the tournament would be played from April 10 to May 24. Last year, there were eight venues. This time it could go up to 11, he said.         
	The IPL governing body has already approved Cuttack and Ahmedabad as likely venues.         
	Modi, who is the president of the Rajasthan Cricket Association, said there was a party who was interested in buying stake in Rajasthan Royals.

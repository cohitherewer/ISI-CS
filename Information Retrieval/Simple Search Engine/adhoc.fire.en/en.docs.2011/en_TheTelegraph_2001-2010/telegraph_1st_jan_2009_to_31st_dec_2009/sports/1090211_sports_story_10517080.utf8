                                                   Mallya: Do not expect miracles
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The ongoing global recession has hit Formula One hard and the Force India team have not been immune to the credit-crunch.         
	Indias first Formula One team had a glittering ceremony at the Gateway of India last year to unveil its car, but in its second year it has been reduced to a mere media statement. There will be no formal launch (of the car) this year, the teams co-owner Vijay Mallya said here on Tuesday.         
	Force India have signed up with McLaren-Mercedes for technical support this year. But the switch from Ferrari  the engine suppliers in 2008  is yet to be completed and the delay has had an effect.         
	The drivers  Giancarlo Fisichella and Adrian Sutil  have not driven the car so far. The two testing sessions scheduled in the first week of March, before the opening race in Australia, will be the only opportunity for them to get a hang of the car.         
	Mallya asked the fans to not have undue expectations.         
	The drivers have the simulators to familiarise themselves with the new car, he said. I would like to say one thing though, dont expect miracles. No team has had enough testing and so, the first couple of races would be shakedown races. From Barcelona onwards, we would be seriously competitive, Mallya said.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Warne: Need young blood
                      
	Melbourne: With Australia still struggling to cope up with the retirements of some key players, spin legend Shane Warne has called on the selectors to pump in young blood in the team before it is too late.         
	You have to say the Australian side has been in a transition phase but there has to be a line that when does that transition phase stop? he said.         
	I wouldnt say Australia is the fourth best side in the world, but the way the side has played in recent times you need to be patient. But there comes a time when you say okay, are these guys in the side going to see us through in the long term or is there an opportunity to get some new blood in the side? he remarked.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav answer makes Buchanan uneasy
                                                     Sourav answer makes Buchanan uneasy
    - KKR practice tie scrapped after drunk driver delays kits arrival from port elizabeth           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sourav Ganguly during a news conference in Durban on Tuesday                                 
	Durban: The high chairs, in a very filmi setting, were occupied by John Buchanan and Brendon McCullum, but the man of the evening at the Sun Coast Cinemas auditorium No.6 was Sourav Ganguly.         
	Asked, at a Q amp;A session here on Tuesday, whether he would have done things differently had he still been the Kolkata Knight Riders captain, Sourav replied: Ill not be able to answer that...         
	The number of words were few, but the impact devastating. Buchanan, the franchises head of cricket operations, looked ill at ease and McCullum couldnt exactly have been breathing easy either.         
	Barely had that answer been digested that Sourav was asked another one. Was he comfortable at No.4 or would he prefer No.3? Im comfortable anywhere, he said, rather blandly.         
	Read between the lines and his preference becomes clear.         
	If Sourav, mobbed by fans after the session, stole the show, successor McCullum invited praise for being candid.         
	My form has been disappointing... Its been putting us on the backfoot... Hopefully, well get dynamic at the top (before Chris Gayle departs, as of now, on Friday)... Im leading a fantastic team, but the results havent been there... However, we still believe we can win this IPL, he maintained.         
	McCullum reiterated that he would quit if the Knights didnt make the semi-finals. If I cant inspire my team, take them to the semis, then Im perhaps not quite the man to captain... Right now, though, Im focused on us trying to get some momentum in the tournament...         
	Buchanan felt the players werent relaxed enough as they were trying too hard and being tight had affected their game. Principal owner Shah Rukh Khan, incidentally, made the same observation a day earlier.         
	According to Buchanan, the first six overs of any T20 game, in both innings, were crucial.         
	The Knights next match is against the Royal Challengers Bangalore, at Kingsmead, on Wednesday.         
	Both teams are under pressure (last two on the points table) and both are looking for momentum... is how McCullum put it.         
	With hardly anything to play around with, The Telegraph learns that Ajit Agarkar will return to the XI in place of the injured Anureet Singh.         
	Tough, by the way, is the word used by the Royal Challengers coach, Ray Jennings, looking ahead to Wednesday.         
	The match will be captain Kevin Pietersens last for the Royal Challengers this season and, so, fireworks are on the cards. Clearly, the Englishman would at least like to leave on a high.         
	Meanwhile, the Knights practice match against the Kings XI Punjab, on Tuesday afternoon, had to be scrapped as the van carrying the kit bags from Port Elizabeth got delayed by many hours.         
	Reason? The driver got drunk on the way and had to be replaced!

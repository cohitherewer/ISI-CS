                                                   India colts register emphatic victory
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Opener Mayhank Agarwal and Mandeep Singh smashed superb centuries to guide the Indian under-19 team to an emphatic 187-run victory against their Australian counterparts in the second limited overs cricket match here on Thursday.         
	Mayhank hit a 142-ball 160 and Mandeep, batting at No. 3, carved out an unbeaten 151, powering India to a massive 371 for four from their stipulated 50 overs after captain Ashok Menaria chose to bat on a flat Bellerive Oval wicket.         
	In reply, Australia could only manage 184 before being skittled out in 43.3 overs.         
	India now lead the five-match series 2-0 with the next game  a three-day encounter  starting at Bellerive on Saturday before the series moves to Perth next week.         
	Mayhanks knock was studded with 16 fours and six sixes and his partnership with Mandeep shut the Australians out of the game.         
	Australia captain Tom Triffitt rotated eight bowlers, all of whom faced heavy attack from the Indian top-order.         
	Mayhank received excellent support from Mandeep who reached his hundred in the 43rd over  his century coming in 91 deliveries as the pair put on 270 runs for the third wicket.         
	Queenslander Alister McDermott finished with figures of two for 67 from his 10 overs for the hosts.         
	Triffitt praised the way the Indian top-order went about their batting.         
	It was awesome to see the Indians bat today and going so hard at us and bat so well, the teenager said. They play so differently Theyve got different strengths and they utilised the short boundary so well and we probably didnt bowl quite as well as we would have liked, he said.         
	The hosts slipped to two for 13 at one stage during their batting. However, West Australian opener Tom Beaton stuck around, combining with Tim Armstrong (37) to put on a 77-run partnership.         
	All-rounder Adam Coyte was unable to bat after suffering an injury in his bicep while fielding in the outfield.         
	Beaton top-scored for the Aussies, his knock of 73 coming off 80 deliveries and included six boundaries and two sixes.         
	Toms a good batsman Hes played that sort of innings at the (underage) championships pretty regularly; hes a pretty consistent performer and it was a good innings from him today, Triffitt said.         
	In the first match, captain Ashok Menaria scored an unbeaten 63 as they won by seven wickets at the Bellerive Oval. Electing to bat, the Australains were bowled out for 168 in 48 over. The Indians reached the target in 44.3 overs.

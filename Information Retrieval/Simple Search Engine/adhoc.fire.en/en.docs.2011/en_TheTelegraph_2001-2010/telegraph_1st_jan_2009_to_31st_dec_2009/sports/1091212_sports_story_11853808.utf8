The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Golden boy Suranjoy
                                                                                                                       7                                      Golden boy Suranjoy
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Moments after he had outclassed Frenchman Nordine Oubaali 8-1 in the 51kg final Friday to become the first Indian to win a gold medal in the inter-continental Presidents Cup, Suranjoy Singh jumped over the ropes to embrace national coach Gurbax Singh Sandhu.         
	Sir, I have done it finally, was all the Manipur boxer could say overcome with emotion before two other members of the Asian team rushed in to congratulate the wonder boy from India.         
	In 2007, Suranjoys career had looked as good as over when he decided to walk out of the national camp without informing the authorities. He was in no mood to resume the career but was persuaded back to the ring by Sandhu and a few others.         
	I could well imagine what was going on in his mind, Sandhu told The Telegraph. Its a great day for Indian boxing. We were sure Suranjoy would not disappoint us today, he added.         
	I was confident of winning, said Suranjoy, returning from the mandatory dope test. I had never fought this Frenchman before. But I knew he was an aggressive boxer. He is also good in back-pedalling. I did not allow him to do it today. Once I picked up early points, I was careful enough to maintain the lead, the 22-year-old pugilist said.         
	Using his trademark left straights and cross punches, Suranjoy had taken a 3-0 lead at the end of the opening round and, in the next three minutes, scored four more points to go 7-0 up. The final round ended 1-1 but the huge lead from the previous rounds was enough for the Indian to emerge triumphant.         
	The victory fetched Suranjoy $3,000 in prize money at the prestigious season-ending event in Azerbaijan, where confederations from Asia, America, Africa, Europe and Oceania were pitted against each other.         
	The boy was really brilliant in the final, admitted Sandhu. Never for a moment did he allow his opponent to land a punch on him. I asked him to keep his guard up and he did exactly that.         
	Starting with the AK Mishra meet in Chandigarh, where he won with ease, the Manipuri lad has stunned the world with back-to-back gold medals in the Czech Republic Grand Prix and the Asian Elite championships in China.         
	I was not too interested in boxing in childhood, said Suranjoy. Football was my first love then but I switched to boxing because of my elder brother, a top national level boxer. I started as a 48kg boxer and then graduated to 51 kg.         
	Suranjoy has had a strong showing in the Presidents Cup, beginning with a victory over Beijing Olympic bronze medallist Vincenzo Picardi following it up with a resounding 10-4 win against Mexican Braulio Avila, who was competing for Americas II.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Ryuji may get a start
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Japanese Ryuji Sueoka is likely to get his first start when Mohun Bagan take on Calcutta Customs in a CFL Premier Division match at the club ground on Sunday.         
	Ryuji was impressive when he came on as a substitute against Kalighat MS the other day, and on Sunday, if he gets a start, will partner Edeh Chidi upfront.         
	Ishfaq Ahmed is suffering from a groin injury and may sit out on Sunday. Bagan are on a high after their 4-0 win over Kalighat MS.

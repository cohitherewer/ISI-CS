                                                   Pressure on NZ in 3rd ODI today
  - The hosts biggest challenge is to get rid of virender Sehwag early                             
	Christchurch: A confident India will look to continue their domination when they clash against New Zealand in the third one-day International here on Sunday, fully aware that the pressure will be more on the hosts who face a do-or-die battle.         
	Leading 1-0, a win on Sunday will ensure that India will not lose the series and they can push for a series victory in the last two matches with a more relaxed approach.         
	But the two rain-marred matches at Napier and Wellington have not only upset the rhythm of the players to some extent, but has also put New Zealand in a tricky situation.         
	Sehwag is in red-hot form and has already logged two half centuries (77 and 54) in the series and India will look to him for yet another explosive start.         
	The Master Blaster from Delhi has terrorised the New Zealand bowlers so much that except for Ian Butler and Daniel Vettori, the others are not sure where to bowl to him.         
	If it has been pitched short, Sehwag has disdainfully pulled, hooked and cut. If the ball has been pitched up, he has effortlessly heaved it over the in-field or bisected the fielders with crunchy drives. New Zealands plans have all been put in awry.         
	The hosts biggest challenge, and admittedly their foremost goal, is to get rid of Sehwag early, which they have not managed to do in the last two ODIs.         
	But Vettori has not realised that it was not Sehwag who produces most of Indias win. He does set it up, but Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Yusuf Pathan and Dhoni have contributed when it mattered most.         
	The Black Caps would be at peril if they underestimate Sachin Tendulkar, who has prudently switched to the role of a moderator.         
	The Mumbaikar may be 36 years old, but he still has the fire to take the attack to the rivals, as he did in the abandoned ODI at the Westpac stadium.         
	It was the fear of their batting being decimated by the destructive combo of Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma that New Zealand, who had blatantly prepared green tops on Indias last tour here, opted for flat, hard and brown tracks.         
	Though Ishant has not played a match since hurting his right shoulder, Zaheer and Praveen Kumar have combined to rock the inexperienced New Zealand batting line-up.         
	Instead of spending sleepless nights over Sehwag, the Black Caps would do well to play to pep up their confidence, which has been at a low since losing the rain-truncated first one-dayer at Napier by 53 runs.         
	Unlike India, theirs is an inexperienced side, with a good crop of batsmen and bowlers.         
	They need to train their eye on the future, rather than worry about immediate goals. Perhaps, this spirit would help to exorcise their fear for Sehwag, their nemesis.

                                                   Mahesh, Mark in quarters
                      
	Cincinnati: Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles moved into the quarter finals of the Cincinnati Masters after edging past Feliciano Lopez and Fernando Verdasco in the second round on Wednesday.         
	The fourth seed Indo-Bahamian combination overcame a first set deficit and a fighting Spanish pair 5-7, 6-4, 12-10 in one hour and 29 minutes. They will now take on the French pair of Michael Lodra and Jo-Wilfred Tsonga.         
	Meanwhile, in singles, Andy Roddick failed to read the script as he was up-ended in the second round.         
	Roger Federer, Andy Murray, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic all advanced to round three, but Roddicks US Open preparations suffered a blow with his 6-7, 6-7 loss to fellow-American Sam Querrey.         
	Seventh-seeded Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga was also despatched 7-6, 6-2 by Australian qualifier Chris Guccione. (Agencies)

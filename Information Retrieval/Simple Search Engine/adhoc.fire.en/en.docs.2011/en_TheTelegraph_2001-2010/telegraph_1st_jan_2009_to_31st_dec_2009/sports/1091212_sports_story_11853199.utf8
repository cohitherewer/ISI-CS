The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | NZ in command after first day
                                                                                                                       7                                        NZ in command after first day

	Napier: Imran Farhat lifted Pakistan from the depths of 59 for five and resuscitated his career with a fighting century but New Zealand will be more than pleased with their efforts, on the first day of the third and final Test here on Friday.         
	The Black Caps were 47 for no loss after restricting Pakistan to 223. According to Cricinfo, Iain Brien was on a mission to make his last Test memorable. Until Farhat produced his hundred it was all Brien. At one point his figures read: 4.2-4-3-3.         
	He was hostile throughout his spell, consistently bowling over 140 kmph, and was always accurate.         
	Daryl Tuffey also claimed four lower-order Pakistan batsmen on a flat pitch where the visitors top-order contrived to implode yet again by playing poor cricket. Only one batsman, Misbah-ul-Haq, was taken out by a difficult delivery.

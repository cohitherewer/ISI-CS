The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | There was no need to stop game: Daljit
                                                                                                                       7                                      There was no need to stop game: Daljit
                      
	New Delhi: The Kotla pitch was by no means unplayable and the fifth and final one-dayer between India and Sri Lanka should have gone on, feels former BCCI pitches and grounds committee chairman Daljit Singh.         
	Nevertheless, Daljit does admit that the pitch should have been tested and that not doing so was a cardinal mistake.         
	The Kotla fiasco, which saw the ODI being called off after 23.3 overs due to a dangerous playing surface, led to the sacking of the five-member BCCI committee, headed by Daljit.         
	Daljit said he was amazed to see the match get abandoned, especially since Sri Lanka were already midway through their innings. It was not the best of pitches but I dont understand the reason behind the abandonment, Daljit said.         
	The game should have gone on. 23.3 overs were already over and the slower bowlers were already in I feel the worst was over by then, Daljit added.         
	Daljit feels that instead of joining in the blame game, the DDCA and those involved with the turf, him included, should accept responsibility. It is sad that the match was abandoned but it is a collective responsibility. I dont want to play the blame game but I was just helping the DDCA, Daljit said.         
	Daljit also accepted that both him and the DDCA were at fault for not testing the wicket before the one-dayer.         
	That was a mistake We made the cardinal mistake of not playing a practice match. I came in late and suggested a bowling session but not a match.         
	While planting the grass the surface got disturbed and it should have been tested, the veteran curator and former first class cricketer added. (PTI)

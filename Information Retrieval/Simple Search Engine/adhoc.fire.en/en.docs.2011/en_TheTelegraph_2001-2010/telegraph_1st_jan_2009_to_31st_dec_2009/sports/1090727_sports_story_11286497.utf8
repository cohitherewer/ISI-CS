                                                   Missed Massa: Lewis
                      
	Budapest: McLarens Lewis Hamilton won his first Formula One race of the season Sunday at the Hungarian Grand Prix overshadowed by the absence of Felipe Massa, who remained hospitalised with life-threatening injuries from a crash a day earlier.         
	Ive had a great relationship and weve had some great battles and not to see him today was difficult, said Hamilton, who beat Massa by a single point in the 2008 championship following a battle that stretched to the final corner of the final lap of the season.         
	We miss him and wish him well and wish him a speedy recovery.         
	Hamilton, who finished 11.5 seconds ahead of Kimi Raikkonen, started pumping his fists in celebration before even crossing the line, unable to rein in his emotions following a largely frustrating season for the British driver and his team.         
	He patted the No. 1 sticker on his car emphatically after emerging from the cockpit and then had to wrestle the celebratory champagne back from team principal Martin Whitmarsh as McLaren returned to the podium for the first time this season.         
	Its an incredible feeling to be back here after what feels such a long time away, and such a struggle with me and my team, Hamilton said after his 10th career win. We didnt expect to win this season. Undoubtedly we caught up this weekend.         
	Massa was struck in the helmet Saturday by a loose piece from another car, causing him to crash into the tyre barrier at high speed. During the race, Ferraris garage displayed a banner reading Forza Felipe Siamo Con Te or Be Strong Felipe, We Are With You.         
	It was very unfortunate what happened. Yesterday was terrifically freakish, Mark Webber said. But we dont want to get too carried away with it. We missed him on the grid but the show must go on.           (AP)

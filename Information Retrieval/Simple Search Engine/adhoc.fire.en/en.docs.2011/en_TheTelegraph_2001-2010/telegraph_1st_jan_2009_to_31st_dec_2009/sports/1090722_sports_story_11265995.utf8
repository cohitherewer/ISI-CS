	London: Usain Bolt said Tuesday that he is running at 85 per cent of his potential going into his final meet before next months world championships.         
	Yes, Im not in the best shape of my life but Im still in good shape, Bolt said, ahead of the two-day London Grand Prix. I think Im probably close, probably 85 per cent.         
	Bolt runs in the 100 metres on Friday, one week after he ran a season-best 9.79 seconds in poor weather in Paris  just .10 seconds more than his world record run in the Olympic final last August.         
	After having surgery on his left foot following a car accident in April, Bolt believes the interruption to his training means he wont be at his best until the August 15-23 worlds in Berlin. Still, he would not rule out a record time at the Crystal Palace track Friday.         
	You never know for me whats possible if the weather is good  I doubt it will be. Im bringing the rain wherever I go, he said. For me, its not all about time, its all about performance. Its just to see where Im at and what I need to do.         
	Bolts biggest challenge Friday should come from Asafa Powell, a teammate on Jamaicas world record 4x100 relay team in Beijing. Powell was the last man to beat Bolt, winning in Stockholm exactly a year ago, and has a best of 9.72 set last September.         
	Hes a great athlete and a great performer, Bolt said of Powell. Our (personal best times) are not very far apart.         
	Athletics fans must wait until Berlin for a showdown over 100 metres between Bolt and Tyson Gay, the current world champion and the fastest man in the world this year.         
	I have never backed down from any challenge out in front of me, Bolt said. Rivalry is always good. It excites me in a way to know that theres somebody out there who could beat me.         
	Gays 9.77 in Rome earlier this month matched his own United States record, while the 26-year-old from Kentucky posted a 19.58 over 200 in New York in May that is one-hundredth faster than Bolt over the distance this year.         
	Gay will run the 200 at the London GP on Saturday, before the two step on the same track for a 4x100 relay that closes the meet.         
	Bolt said he would analyze his two 100 runs in London to get it right for the worlds, but would concentrate more on his 200 before Berlin.

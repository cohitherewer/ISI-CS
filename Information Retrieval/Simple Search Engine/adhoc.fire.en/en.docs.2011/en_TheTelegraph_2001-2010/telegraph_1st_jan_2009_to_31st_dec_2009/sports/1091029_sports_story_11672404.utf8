The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev eyes treble
                                                   Jeev eyes treble
                      
	Casares (Spain): The prospect of a unique treble will spur Jeev Milkha Singh when the Indian tees off in the Volvo World Match Play Championship here on Thursday.         
	Jeev, in fact, gave up his title defence at the Singapore Open this week to back himself for a Volvo treble and the Indian, despite nursing an ankle injury, is confident of making his mark.         
	The Volvo China Open victory re-launched my career, and the win in Volvo Masters, also in 2006, was probably the biggest breakthrough in my career so far, said Jeev. Volvo has been great for me, great for golf and they understood when I was unable to defend the Volvo China Open when I qualified for the US Masters, and its good to be able to reciprocate this year, said the Indian.         
	Jeev said the sore ankle still hurts but he would not throw in the towel. Yes, its a little bit sore but well see how it goes on what looks a very tough golf course, he said.         
	Jeev is in a tough group. The 15th seed is up against Lee Westwood, Camilo Villegas and Ross Fisher for a place in Saturdays semi-finals.         
	The 37-year-old Indian entered the 16-man field as the highest-ranked player from Asia and became the first player from the subcontinent to play in the professional golfs longest-running match play championship.         
	On his decision to play the event over Singapore Open, Jeev said, I view myself now as a truly global golfer and when I was told that I had qualified for the Volvo World Match Play Championship as the highest ranked Asian player, it left me with a big decision to make  to defend in Singapore or mix it with the world-class field in Spain.         
	World No. 4 Paul Casey, meanwhile, will make his first appearance since July Thursday. Casey returns after a rib injury which has ruled him out since the British Open and caused him to slip from first to fourth in the Race to Dubai money list.         
	This is the longest Ive been out of action and I am really eager to get back out on the course, Casey said. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Poor show is big setback, says U-16 coach Toal
                                                   Poor show is big setback, says U-16 coach Toal
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The poor showings of the Indian under-16 team in the Asian qualifiers in United Arab Emirates (UAE) recently is a big setback for the countrys youth development programme, according to Colin Toal, the technical director of the All India Football Federation (AIFF).         
	India , who reached the final rounds in the previous championships, conceded 15 goals in five matches to crash out of the tournament with just four points in the five-team group.         
	Toal, who was credited with doing an excellent job with the juniors since 2006, said the lack of preparations was the main reason for the disappointing results.         
	Our preparations were hampered when 17 boys were found overage after months of training and had to be changed. It hindered our plans so much that we could do nothing to improve the situation at that moment.         
	While the British coach said all associations and clubs should realise how important it was to eliminate the menace of age cheating at the junior level, sources claimed the AIFF should take the responsibility for the poor results.         
	Naturally the federation was the first to know when a whole lot of boys in the camp were found overage after medical check ups, sources said. Instead of acting swiftly, the AIFF officials sat on the reports for months before deciding to select a new set of boys. That was the period when the backbone of the team was broken, the sources pointed out.         
	The AIFF tried to pass the blame on the state associations for fielding overage players in the national championship but later it was found that certain boys were actually picked up by the federation directly.         
	Toal said long term development plans (LTDP) needed to be introduced to improve the standard of football in India . We will certainly bounce back. I am hopeful the under-19 team will do well in the Asian meet at Iraq, he claimed.

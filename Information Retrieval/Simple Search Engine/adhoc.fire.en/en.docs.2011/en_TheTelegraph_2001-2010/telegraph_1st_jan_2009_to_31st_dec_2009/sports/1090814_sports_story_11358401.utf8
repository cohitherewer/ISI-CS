                                                     Capello rues mistakes
            JASON BURT     
	Amsterdam: England were guilty of committing stupid mistakes, according to manager Fabio Capello after the 2-2 friendly draw away to Holland which was salvaged through two second-half goals from substitute Jermain Defoe.         
	Capello praised the strikers performance and the displays of two other substitutes  James Milner and Carlton Cole  but did not disguise his amazement at the errors, which had punctuated a poor first-half performance and handed the Dutch two goals.         
	They were two presents. But I prefer to give presents in non-competitive games, Capello said of the blunders by Rio Ferdinand and Gareth Barry who both foolishly surrendered possession. These were just two stupid mistakes. Two silly mistakes.         
	However Capello said that, in a sense, he did not need to get angry with such errors because they were so ridiculous. The mistakes of this evening I can accept. I dont accept mistakes where the position is wrong or if I try doing something in training and then, afterwards, I dont see it being put into practice on the pitch, Capello said.         
	The manager maintained he had not lost his temper with his players at half-time  as John Terry had revealed he is prone to do  despite their poor performances. I was really calm, Capello said. You have to understand what you have to do. Its not always the same. Its very important psychologically for the players to understand, if the manager has confidence that they can recover the result.         
	Sometimes youre angry because some mistakes that they did were incredible. Different mistakes to these. Indeed Capello said the errors may have been due to too much confidence.         
	He added: Its possible in pre-season to do mistakes like these. I prefer that we do these here. Not when the game is really important for World Cup qualification. And, also, Im happy for the spirit of the team. I spoke with the players (at half-time). We have to play 45 minutes more and Im sure we can recover the result. And the players played very well in the second half. Also in the first half, after the first goal, we had two or three chances to equalise.         
	I think the spirit and the quality of the players in the second half, with the style we played, was very good. The Daily Telegraph

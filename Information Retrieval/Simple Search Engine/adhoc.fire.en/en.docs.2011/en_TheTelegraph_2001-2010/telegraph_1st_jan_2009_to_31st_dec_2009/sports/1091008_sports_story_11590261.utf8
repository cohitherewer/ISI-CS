The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Challengers devoid of star power
                                                   Challengers devoid of star power
                      
	Nagpur: Injury to key players, and the ensuing Champions League Twenty20 will mean that the N.K.P. Salve Challenger Trophy, which starts at the VCA Stadium at Jamtha from Thursday, will be without big stars.         
	Sachin Tendulkar, Yuvraj Singh, Irfan Pathan, Rahul Dravid, Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag and Rohit Sharma are some of the prominent names that will be missing during the 50-over tournament.         
	Dravid will be seen donning the colours of the Royal Challengers Bangalore, Sehwag and Gambhir will represent the Delhi DareDevils, and Rohit Sharma will be on duty for IPL-II winners Deccan Chargers in the inaugural Champions League, also starting Thursday.         
	Yuvraj and Irfan are out of the tournament due to injuries, while Tendulkar has opted for rest prior to the seven-match ODI series against Australia.         
	Maharashtras Ameya Shrikhande will replace Yuvraj, who was named the India Red skipper, now to be led by Tamil Nadu batsman Subramaniam Badrinath, and Vikramjeet Malik has been named as a replacement for India Greens Irfan Pathan.         
	Tamil Nadu opener Abhinav Mukund, fresh from his century in the Irani Cup for Rest of India against Mumbai, has been rewarded with a place in the India Blue side, as a replacement for Sachin Tendulkar.         
	Saurabh Tiwary will replace India Greens Manoj Tiwary, who has been summoned by Delhi DareDevils.         
	However, the tournament will provide a great opportunity to players like Yusuf Pathan, Ishant Sharma and Laxmipathy Balaji to run into some form. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Maria makes first final after return
                                                   Maria makes first final after return
                      
	Toronto: Russias Maria Sharapova took another big step in her comeback at the Rogers Cup on Saturday reaching her first final in more than year with a gritty 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 over Alisa Kleybanova.         
	Playing for a title for the first time since Amelia Island in April 2008, Sharapova will try to confirm her return from shoulder surgery with a victory when she takes on compatriot Elena Dementieva in the final.         
	Fourth seeded Dementieva advanced to her fourth final of the year with a 7-6, 6-1 win over world No. 2 Serena Williams.         
	Coming back after not playing for a while is always tough, Sharapova said. Im grateful I have another chance to be in a final. (Reuters)

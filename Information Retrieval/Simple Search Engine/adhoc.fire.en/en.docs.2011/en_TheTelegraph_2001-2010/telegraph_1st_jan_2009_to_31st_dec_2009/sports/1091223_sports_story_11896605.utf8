	A magic healing balm is what all tennis players would love to have from Father Christmas. At the end of the season, in December, all the players are battered, bruised and totally exhausted, trying to recuperate and hasten recovery from their injuries in order to be ready for the new season.         
	Punishing tournament schedules are taking a toll on the players. The draws bristle with walkover victories due to injury while courtside treatment during medical time-outs are a common sight. Longer and faster rallies are escalating physical demands. But Federer soldiers on.         
	He ended 2009 on a triumphant note, firmly on the throne as No. 1. An unlikely victory in the French Open, followed by his sixth Wimbledon title and a loss in the final of the US Open established Federer as the greatest ever.         
	After Nadals victory over Federer in the Australian Open, it had seemed to be the dawn of the Spaniards era. Nadal had beaten Federer on all surfaces, and was six years younger. But Nadals intense and highly-strung style, always going at full throttle, proved to be too much for his rippling muscles.         
	Tendonitis in both knees, followed by niggles in the abdominal muscles and lower back brought him down. By the end of the year, an array of past no-hopers had beaten Nadal badly.         
	The fighter-like jog while squaring up at the net for the toss and the sprint to the baseline to start the match is still there, but the old spirit was gone. The spectacular unbelievable winners from hopeless positions are not there any more.         
	Pat Rafter has suggested a six month lay-off for Nadal to rest his exhausted and injured limbs. But coming back fresh and then tuning up to the highest level is a very difficult task. Specially with several of the top players on a rampage, playing flat out with the conviction that both Nadal and Federer are now within range and can be beaten.         
	The giant figure of the 66 Argentine, Juan Martin del Potro, towers over the world of tennis today. Del Potro is not a monsoon mushroom, but has solid roots. At 21 years of age, several tournament titles, topped with victory in the US Open, are sparkling credentials for the future. At Flushing Meadows, Del Potro unleashed rocket-like winning forehands which stunned Federer.         
	At the Masters in London, too, Federer failed to deliver the coup de grace when he was in a winning position. Previously Federer always produced his best to find his way out of losing positions, like serving aces in tie-breakers. The inability to close out matches is one of the first signs of Father time. The bite fades out gently and imperceptibly and recovery time between matches become sluggish.         
	We will see flashes of the old Federer in 2010, but the autumn leaves are drifting past the window of the greatest-ever. Nadal, too, may never be the player he has been in the past few years. Novak Djokovic is one of the front-runners for the No. 1 spot in 2010. Currently being coached by Todd Martin, a former top five player with a serve and volley game, Djokovic is possibly hoping to develop more aggression in his game.         
	But at this stage, when Djokovics game is close to full maturity, introducing a new element is very difficult as there is always the tendency to fall back into the old groove when things go wrong. Britains Andy Murray, fiercely Scottish, cannot also be ignored. He certainly has the game to win a Grand Slam title but seems to be brittle of temperament. He is carrying the crushing weight of British expectations. Murray could notch up a Grand Slam victory, but is unlikely to dominate the game.         
	In 2010 the Federer-Nadal clashes may well be there, but it is unlikely that they will ever achieve the intensity or the quality and brilliance of their matches in 2008 and 2009. Their rivalry has truly enriched tennis history. Now the field has caught up with Federer and Nadal and in 2010 they will both be involved in the scrimmaging for the No. 1 spot with Del Potro, Djokovic and Murray.         
	My take is that if Del Potro is able to stay injury free, maintain peak form and fitness during the Grand Slams he could dominate the game with his power in 2010.

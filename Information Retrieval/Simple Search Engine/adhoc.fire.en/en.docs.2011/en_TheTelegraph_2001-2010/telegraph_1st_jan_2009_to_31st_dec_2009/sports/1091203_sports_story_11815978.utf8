	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan romped past Peerless SC 3-0 in a CFL Premier Division match at the club ground on Wednesday.         
	It was a perfect sending off for Karim Bencharifa who flew to Singapore to be with his family. The Moroccan will not be in the bench during Bagans next match against George Telegraph on Saturday and is likely to come back on Dec. 7 or 9.         
	Bagan made their intentions clear right from the kick-off as they launched a series of attacks into the Peerless half. Fortunately for Peerless they did not have the bungling goalkeeper Prasenjit Debnath, who let in four goals against Chirag. His replacement Surabuddin Chowdhury was a picture of confidence and it was much due to his peformance that Bagan had to wait till the 43rd minute for the first goal.         
	The first goal came through a lovely build-up. Ishfaq slipped it to an overlapping Biswajit whose measured cross was volleyed in by an unmarked Chidi.         
	The second was the best of the lot. Chidi centre from the left and the Peerless defence failed to react. Ryuji lunged forward and his powerful header crashed into net, giving Surabuddin hardly any chance. It was the Japanese recruits first goal for the green and maroon brigade.         
	The third came when substitute Micky Fernandes picked out Biswajit on the left and the lateral backs left footer nestled into the net much to the delight of the motley crowd.

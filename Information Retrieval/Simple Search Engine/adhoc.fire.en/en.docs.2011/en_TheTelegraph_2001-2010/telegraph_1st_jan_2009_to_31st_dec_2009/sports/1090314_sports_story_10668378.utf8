The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India beat Pak colts
                                                   India beat Pak colts
                      
	Johor Bahru: India Friday pumped in three first-half goals to stun fancied Pakistan 3-1 and set up a summit clash with the arch-rivals in the final of the Genting Four-Nation Under-21 Hockey tournament at the Taman Daya Stadium on Sunday.         
	Playing firebrand hockey right from the start, the Indians scored through Pramod Kumar (1st), Diwakar Ram (14th) and Danish Mujtaba (19th) to lead 3-0 at breather.         
	Pakistan reduced the margin in the 51st minute with a penalty corner strike by Muhammed Attique.         
	This was Indias third convincing win in as many days. Earlier they had outplayed hosts Malaysia and then demolished Singapore.         
	For Pakistan, it was their first defeat of the tournament.         
	India dominated the encounter from the opening minute. And it was in the very first minute they went into the lead when captain Diwakar Rams crisp hit on the right-flank was relayed by Mandip Antil for Pramod Kumar to connect past rival goalkeeper Imran Butt and give India lead.         
	The Pakistan defence were caught on the wrong foot as India mounted their raids with crafty stick-work and ball skills by Danish Mujtaba and Victo Singh.         
	Midfielders Belsajar Horo, Manjeet Kullu and Vikas Sharma denied Pakistan space to orchestrate their attacks.           (PTI)

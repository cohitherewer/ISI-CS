	Calcutta: The weather was overcast and gloomy in the city and it was equally depressing for the Calcuttans at Gorky Sadan on Tuedsay.         
	Indias best bet in the ongoing Kolkata Open Grandmaster Chess meet, sponsored by the Peerless, city-based GM Sandipan Chanda went down to Anton Filippov to fall behind in the title race. Sandipan held the upper hand for most part of the game, but he went astray under time pressure and handed the game on a platter to Filippov.         
	Meanwhile, IM S. Satyapragyan emerged as the highest-ranked Indian as he upset GM Mikheil Mchedlishvili. In the process, Satyapragyan earned a Grandmaster 9 game-GM norm. WGM Nisha Mohota, who drew with IM Deep Sengupta, completed her third and final mens IM norm.

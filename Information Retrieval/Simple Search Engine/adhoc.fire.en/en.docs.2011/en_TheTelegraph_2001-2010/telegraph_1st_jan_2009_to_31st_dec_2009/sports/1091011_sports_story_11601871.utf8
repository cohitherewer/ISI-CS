The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | US lead cut   to one point
                                                     US lead cut   to one point
          
	San Francisco: South Africas Tim Clark rolled in a 14-foot eagle putt on the 18th green to cap a late fight back by the Internationals against the US in the opening fourball matches at the Presidents Cup on Friday.         
	With Clark and Vijai Singh sealing a one-up victory over Lucas Glover and Stewart Cink and Ernie Els and Mike Weir winning the last three holes against Jim Furyk and Anthony Kim, the Internationals ended the day one point behind the holders.         
	Early on, the Americans had led in five of the six matches but, with the honours ultimately shared in the best-ball format, they lead by 6- points to 5- going into Saturdays foursomes.         
	Clark sank to his knees in celebration after his curling putt caught the left edge of the cup before dropping in, wrapping up a nail-biting win for the South African and Singh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan upbeat for JCT tie
                                                   Bagan upbeat for JCT tie
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                Barreto      
	New Delhi: A point away from a semi-final spot, Mohun Bagan were a confident lot on the eve of their concluding Durand Cup group league match against JCT on Friday.         
	The Calcutta team, who routed ONGC 5-1 in their opening match, now need a draw against Sukhwinder Singhs team to top their group.         
	Bagan mainstay Jose Barreto, however, has warned his teammates against complacency.         
	ONGC are not the best team in the world. We had an easy outing against them. Things wont be the same against JCT, he said.         
	The Brazilian striker said his team should look for full points against JCT.         
	We cant go into the match hoping for a draw. Such a mentality may invite trouble, he said.         
	Barreto was not far from the truth. JCT are a compact side and have an enviable track record against the Calcutta teams, especially at the Ambedkar Stadium.         
	Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa said he was aware of this, but added that things were moving in the right direction for his team.         
	I am relieved to find that the Barreto-Edeh Chidi combination is doing well. My boys are ready to overcome any opposition, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Churchill Brothers and Dempo Sports Club set up a semi-final clash. Dempo defeated Army XI 1-0 on Thursday, while Churchill were held by Assam Rifles 1-1.

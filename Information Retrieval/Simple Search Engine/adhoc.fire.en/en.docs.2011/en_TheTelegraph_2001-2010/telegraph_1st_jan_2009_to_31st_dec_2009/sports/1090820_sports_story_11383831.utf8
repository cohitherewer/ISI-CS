The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The ICC praises prompt Aussies
                                                   The ICC praises prompt Aussies
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                            
	Calcutta/London: The International Cricket Council (ICC) Wednesday confirmed that the Australia team management has reported the incident, where one of its players was approached by a man with suspected links to illegal bookmaking, to its Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU).         
	While noting that there is no evidence of illegal activity as a result of the approach, which occurred after the second Ashes Test at Lords, the ICC praised the player in question and the Australia team management for reporting the issue in a statement issued Wednesday.         
	The ICC added that there is no indication that any matches in the current Ashes series or this years World Twenty20 have been affected by corruption in any way and expressed confidence that all such approaches are being reported.         
	ICC general manager David Richardson said: The ICC, its members and the ACSU will continue to deal effectively with these challenges to ensure the game remains a great sport with great spirit.         
	Coming as it does in the lead up to the Ashes decider, at the Oval, the bookie issue is proving to be quite a distraction for the visiting team but the Australia skipper Ricky Ponting Wednesday said his team was doing whatever it could to cooperate with the ACSUs investigation.         
	Ponting said the matter is under the supervision of the relevant authorities and their main concern at the moment is to focus on the final Test against England.         
	As players and as a team we will do everything by the letter of the law and it has been reported to the ICC, Ponting told reporters. Its now under ICC investigation, and we have other things to worry about, he said.         
	The Australia player was drawn into a conversation at the bar of the team hotel  the Royal Kensington Garden in London  after Australia had lost the second Test at Lords last month, but it is understood that talk did not get as far as money and misdeeds before his suspicions were aroused.         
	One leading British bookmaker said that as much as 10million is expected to be wagered on the Oval Test that will decide the series and the revelations Tuesday are a call for vigilance after Paul Condon, the ACSU chairman, described the growth of the 20-over format as posing the greatest threat to crickets integrity since Cronje and others were handed life bans for their involvement with bookmakers.         
	Ron Hope, a former policeman from Guyana, has been a discreet presence at all the Ashes Tests as the ACSU regional officer. Ravi Sawani, the ACSU chief investigator, declined to comment Tuesday, but cricket is clearly facing another challenge to its credibility on the heels of match-fixing claims involving the rebel Indian Cricket League and complaints by Pakistan players of approaches by bookmakers in Sri Lanka last month.         
	The Indian Premier League has long been identified as a likely target and Lalit Modi, the commissioner, has pledged to employ the ACSU at the competition for the first time next year.

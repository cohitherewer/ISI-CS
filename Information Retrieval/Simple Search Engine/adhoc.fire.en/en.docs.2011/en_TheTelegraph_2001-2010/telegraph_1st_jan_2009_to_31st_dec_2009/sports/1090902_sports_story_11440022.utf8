The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A three-way contest is on
                                                     A three-way contest is on
  - John Wright, Duncan Fletcher and Richard Pybus only ones in contention for top KKR job       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            SELECTORS: Shah Rukh Khan and Sourav Ganguly                                 
	Calcutta: With the interview stage over, it appears John Wright, Duncan Fletcher and Richard Pybus (in that order) are the only ones in contention for the top coaching job in the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	High-flying Wasim Akram may, at best, be a consultant.         
	Two Indians  Lalchand Rajput and Woorkeri Raman  are in the running for the assistant coachs post. Its a tight race, but Rajputs credentials are definitely stronger.         
	Indications are that the new coach/director of cricket will be consulted in the No.2 mans appointment.         
	Wright, according to The Telegraphs sources, stands the best chance if he can confirm unconditional availability.         
	Right now, the former New Zealand captain and ex-India coach is a senior manager with New Zealand Cricket. He works with the Elite coaches.         
	Time, it seems, is an issue with Wright... That needs to be sorted out... The terms and conditions will be discussed after his availability is clear, is how one source put it.         
	As reported in these columns, Fletcher and Pybus, both of whom have coached national teams, made impressive presentations when they met principal owner Shah Rukh Khan and the other selectors, for example, Sourav Ganguly.         
	Sourav, of course, is tipped to be reinstated as the franchises captain.         
	Akram, according to another source, isnt being considered for any position other than that of a consultant. With good reasons, too.         
	Given the nature of Indo-Pak relations, it wont make sense to take him on board as the coach... It will be safe to have him as a consultant, for even if he faces a visa problem, the Knights wont be left rudderless, the source said.         
	Also, a limited role shouldnt infuriate habitual Pakistan-bashers such as the Shiv Sena.         
	Shah Rukh and co-owner Jay Mehta will study the availability of the Wrights before initiating the all-important discussion on the terms and conditions.         
	Getting to that stage may take some days, for the franchise, which must deliver in IPL 2010, is treading with care.         
	Shah Rukh is clear about two things  not handing out contracts in a hurry and, most important, getting the right personnel... Hes learning from the John Buchanan episode, pointed out a Knights watcher.         
	Whatever be the eventual support staff combination, its unlikely that the one holding the top coaching post will enjoy unlimited powers, in the manner that Buchanan did.

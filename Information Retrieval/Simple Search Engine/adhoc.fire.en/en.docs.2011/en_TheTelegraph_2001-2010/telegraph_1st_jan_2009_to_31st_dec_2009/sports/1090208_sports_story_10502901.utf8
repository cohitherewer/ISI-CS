The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians play without logo
                                                   Indians play without logo
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The national hockey team, currently playing in the four-nation Punjab Gold Cup in Chandigarh, took the field against New Zealand on Saturday without the sponsors logo on their jerseys.         
	The Indian team management had to hastily remove the logo from the team shirts after the Calcutta High Court on Friday restrained the ad hoc committee on hockey from displaying any logo on the national team jerseys.         
	The order was passed after the Calcutta based Leisure Sports Management (LSM) approached the court to restrain the ad hoc committee from using the logo of any other sponsor apart from that of Sahara on team shirts. The LSM is the sports management group of the Sahara India Pariwar.         
	LSM managing director Benu Dasgupta said: There will be a hearing on this issue next week. The ad hoc committee has violated the agreement by displaying the logo of another company on the shirts.

	Abu Dhabi: Australian off-spinner Nathan Hauritz on Sunday said he was relishing the challenge of bowling against Pakistans batsmen, who were adept at playing slow bowlers.         
	The 27-year-old took three key Pakistani wickets to help Australia bowl their rivals out for a modest 207 in the second match in Dubai on Friday.         
	Australia won the match by six wickets to level the five-match one-day series one-all. The third match will be played here on Monday.         
	Hauritz, who went wicket-less in Pakistans four-wicket win in the first match in Dubai Wednesday, said it was a great challenge to play Pakistan.         
	It is great to bowl on these wickets and against these guys, who are great players of spin under these conditions, Hauritz said after his teams practice session.         
	Hauritz said Australia were focused on winning the series.         
	Australia havent won a series since beating Bangladesh (last year) and have struggled to win even two matches in a row, so the focus is on consistency, said Hauritz, who has taken 20 wickets in 16 one-day matches.         
	Australia have lost twice to South Africa  both home and away  and squared a series against New Zealand last year to lose their number one rankings in limited overs cricket. South Africa now top the one-day ranking, followed by Australia.         
	Weve played some good cricket in patches and it would be great to string a few (wins) together, said Hauritz. Were not far off and theres some good players back in and guys finding form.

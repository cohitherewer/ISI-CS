                                                   Cloud over IPL ties at the CCI 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Cricket Club of India (CCI) on Thursday cancelled its extraordinary general meeting to discuss whether the Brabourne Stadium would host the IPL matches, including the final, this season. The EGM was scheduled for February 27.         
	The club management decided to cancel the EGM after ascertaining the mood of its members during an open house discussion last week.         
	There was an overwhelming feeling among the members that they did not want to be inconvenienced (by the hosting of IPL matches). Some members wanted the matches to happen, some did not. And some wanted the matches but did not want to compromise (on their rights), Kamaljeet Rajpal, chief executive and secretary of the CCI, said.         
	From the feeling displayed by the members, the management thought that it would be better not to have the matches at all ... We had received an offer from the IPL, and we have rejected this. We will be writing to them soon.         
	IPL officials werent available for comment while sources in Mumbai Indians said that the negotiations were still on with the CCI.         
	It was announced earlier that the semi-finals would be held in Chennai and the final in Mumbai. DY Patil Stadiumis the other option for the IPL and Mumbai Indians, but the venue has not been favoured by the teams for logistics in the past.

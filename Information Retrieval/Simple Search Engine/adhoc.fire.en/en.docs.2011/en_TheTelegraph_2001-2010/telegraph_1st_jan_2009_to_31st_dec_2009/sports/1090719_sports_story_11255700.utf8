                                                   No Shoaib in SL ODIs
                      
	Karachi: Controversial Pakistani fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar will not be considered for the one-day International (ODI) series in Sri Lanka on fitness grounds, interim chief selector Wasim Bari said on Saturday.         
	Bari said that since Akhtar had only given fitness test but not bowled in the nets, the selectors were not aware of his match fitness. Without knowing his match fitness we cannot select him for the series. Until he plays a few matches, we cannot be sure of his match fitness, Bari said.

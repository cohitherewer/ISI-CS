The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spaniards do a high five
                                                     Spaniards do a high five
                  Spains David Villa                     
	London: World champions Italy and Euro 2008 winners Spain took determined steps towards World Cup qualification with victories Saturday but France and Portugal are struggling after being held to disappointing draws.         
	Nobody was in a position to join already-qualified Netherlands in securing a place at the finals in South Africa next year but Spain can make a provisional booking after seven wins out of seven following a 5-0 home thrashing of Belgium.         
	After forward David Villa missed an early penalty Spain scored three goals in the 10 minutes either side of halftime through David Silva, Villa and defender Gerard Pique.         
	Midfielder Silva added his second after 68 minutes and Villa completed the rout five minutes from time to leave Spain on 21 points with three games remaining in group five.         
	Bosnia, 2-0 winners in Armenia, are second on 15 points with Turkey on 11 after a 4-2 home win over Estonia.         
	Italy needed two own goals by Kakha Kaladze, who plays his club football for AC Milan, to secure a 2-0 win in Georgia.         
	It was enough to keep them top of group eight with 17 points, a point clear of Ireland who won 2-1 in Cyprus thanks to a late header by striker and captain Robbie Keane.         
	Bulgaria too remain in the hunt on 11 points after they thumped visitors Montenegro 4-1.         
	France still face a fight to reach South Africa after a disappointing 1-1 draw in their group seven match with Romania in Paris.           (REUTERS)

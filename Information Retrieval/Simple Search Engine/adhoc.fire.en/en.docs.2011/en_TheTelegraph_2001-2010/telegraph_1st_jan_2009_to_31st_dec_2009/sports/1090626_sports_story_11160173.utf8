            A STAFF REPORTER                                  
	Calcutta: Team India will topple Australia to take the second spot in the Reliance Mobile ICC ODI Championship table if they manage a clean sweep in the four-match series against the West Indies starting in Jamaica on Friday.         
	India and Australia are currently locked at 122 ratings points but the world champions are a step ahead by a fraction of a point.         
	But if Mahendra Singh Dhoni amp; Co. sweep the series in the Caribbean, they will gain one rating point helping them topple the Australians from the second position for the first time since the rankings were introduced in 2002.         
	However, if India fail to register a whitewash, they will lose one point to drop behind Australia even if Dhoni and his side secure a 3-1 series victory.

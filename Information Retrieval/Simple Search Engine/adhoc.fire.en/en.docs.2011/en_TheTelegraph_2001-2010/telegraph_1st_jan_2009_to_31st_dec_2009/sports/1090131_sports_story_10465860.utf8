                                                     Dhoni: Chasing under lights will be tough
                  Mahendra Singh Dhoni                     
	Colombo: India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni is wary of chasing under lights in Saturdays second one-dayer against Sri Lanka at the Premadasa Stadium here and said there will be something in the wicket in the second session.         
	Sri Lanka have enjoyed a good track record on this ground and Dhoni  who helped India successfully chase down 246 runs in the first ODI in Dambulla  feels the wicket at the Premadasa Stadium will have something for the bowlers in the second session.         
	Chasing under lights will be difficult if you bowl at the right areas because there will be something in the wicket in the second half of the game, Dhoni said on Friday.         
	Virender Sehwag will be back in the side after missing the first ODI due to a hip injury but Dhoni does not envisage any problem of plenty.         
	If you start thinking that you have plenty it will be a mistake. We have a very talented side and there are players waiting to fill in, Dhoni said, adding that Sehwag is most likely to open the innings in Saturdays match.         
	The India captain said the team were not relying on individuals but were working as a unit. However, he claimed they have to work on their finishing a bit.         
	We now have batsmen who can really go after the bowling. But one area we can improve is the finishing part, he said.         
	Dhoni also felt it was important for one of the batsmen among the top four to stay on and make some runs.         
	It is important for one of the top batsmen to play a big innings, especially under these conditions where the wicket is slow and when they have good spinners.         
	He also ruled out any change in approach on Saturday from the one they employed in the first match in Dambulla.         
	His Sri Lankan counterpart, Mahela Jayawardene, said he was not unduly worried following the defeat in the first tie.         
	We couldnt (the Sri Lankan batsmen) hang on and put pressure on the Indians, said Jayawardene who believes the wicket at the Premadasa would be a lot harder than Dambulla where they were fooled by the conditions.

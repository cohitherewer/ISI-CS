The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saina counts on support
                                                   Saina counts on support
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Ace shuttler Saina Nehwal is planning to adopt a cautious approach when she starts her campaign in the Indian Open Grand Prix beginning in Hyderabad on Tuesday. The world No.9 from the city of pearls, who is a firm favourite to win the title in front of home crowds, said it was not right to say that she has received a favourable draw in the meet.         
	I do have a good draw but some of the players, like Julia Pei Xian Wong and Maria Kristin Yulianti, are very fine shutters and would be tough nuts to crack. On the whole I am looking forward to a highly competitive tournament. There could be some lower ranked players here but one should not take them lightly. The game is very competitive. But I stand a good chance of winning the title here she added.         
	Saina, who had a disappointing outing in the All-England championship after recovering from her shoulder injury, said the Indian Open could be a dress rehearsal for the world .         
	I enjoy the support of the local people here. I have to play here in the world championship too. This tournament could be a practice event for the bigger show, Saina felt.

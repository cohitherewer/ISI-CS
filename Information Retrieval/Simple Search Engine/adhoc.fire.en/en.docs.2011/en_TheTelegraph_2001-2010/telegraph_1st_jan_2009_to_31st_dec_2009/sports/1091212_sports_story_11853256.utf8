The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mission Mohali tough for India
                                                                                                                       7                                        Mission Mohali tough for India

	Chandigarh: Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men have a tough task in hand as they go into the second Twenty20 match against Sri Lanka at the Punjab Cricket Association Stadium, in nearby Mohali, on Saturday.         
	Wednesdays thrashing in Nagpur, their fourth loss in succession in this format, has exposed the weak links in the former world champions. No doubt the Indians will have a lot of repair work to do in all departments of the game.         
	The acute drop in fielding and bowling standards is as much a worry as the manner in which veteran Sanath Jayasuriya choked the life out of Indias charge for victory with a miserly spell following the Virender Sehwag-Gautam Gambhir blitzkrieg.         
	The fielding is definitely major worry. Mike Young devoted nearly an hour with the players to improve their skills on Friday. He worked with the players in batches and made them work on some specially designed drills.         
	R. Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Dinesh Karthik were among those who were called first for the fielding session. Later, others, including Dhoni, Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, Gautam Gambhir, Yusuf Pathan, Ishant Sharma and Sudeep Tyagi, assembled for a larger fielding session.         
	Dhoni later reiterated that his side was on the backfoot in Nagpur, which the islanders won by 29 runs, due to sloppy fielding.         
	We were never a brilliant fielding side, but we dropped a lot of catches (in Nagpur). A batsman who gets a lease of life (due to fielding lapses) then plays more aggressively. If you miss catches, then you surely are on the back foot, Dhoni said.         
	In Nagpur, the Indians dropped as many as five catches, missed a couple of run out chances and were generally disappointing with the ground fielding as they allowed the islanders to pile up a huge total of 215.         
	Dhoni sounded a trifle concerned about Indias poor run in the shortest format of the game.         
	Unfortunately we are not being able to get into the groove when we play Twenty20 Internationals before the one-day series. We made the mistake of taking them (Twenty20 matches) as warm-up games before one-day matches, Dhoni said.         
	We dont actually think of these Twenty 20 matches as international matches. I am not sure about this but the statistics shows that he added.         
	The Indians will have to deal with some fitness worries as well and have been effectively reduced to 13 men. Sreesanth, who missed the Nagpur match because of a stomach bug, has already been ruled out. That means Ashok Dinda, who dismissed Sanath Jayasuriya in his first over, is likely to play the second game as well.         
	Rohit Sharma, who hurt his shoulder while diving in the last match, has also been ruled out. Rohit took part in the match-eve practice session but Dhoni said the team did not want to take a chance since he was not match fit. Dinesh Karthik is likely to replace him.         
	The dew could have a major role to play with a cold wave sweeping across northern India. Despite predictions of good bounce and carry, it looks like a bat-first-and-win match.         
	The PCA will take extra measures to minimise the dew factor. We will be seeking permission from Match Referee Jeff Crowe to allow the ground staff to quickly run in with the ropes to clear the dew at the fall of every wicket, PCA president Inderjit Singh Bindra said.

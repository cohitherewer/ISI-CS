The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tendulkar is doubtful
                                                     Tendulkar is doubtful

	Christchurch: Sachin Tendulkars abdomen injury is not as serious as initially feared but there is still a question mark on whether the champion batsman will take part in the fourth one-dayer against New Zealand in Hamilton on Wednesday.         
	Tendulkar, who retired hurt after belting a stunning 163 in the third ODI, underwent an MRI scan at a local hospital here. Although the team management did not divulge the scan report, it was learnt that the extent of damage was not as bad as had been feared to be.         
	But a final call on his availability is expected to be taken Tuesday after the practice session.         
	Some of Tendulkars teammates indicated that he may play the match but there was no official word from the team management yet.         
	The Mumbaikar, who scored his 43rd one-day hundred, is said to be a lot more comfortable than he had been Sunday night.         
	The 36-year-old batsman has been among the runs in all the three ODIs played so far, bettering his 20 in Napier with a 61 in the rained-out match at Wellington.         
	Interestingly, while Tendulkar and team doctor Nitin Patel were at the hospital, the rest of the team had a day out in the hills adjoining Christchurch.         
	They went for a mountain drive, rollicking up and down the bumpy slopes in six-wheeled vehicles. Later, they had a swell time, speed jetting at the Waima waters.         
	Having earned a good outing for outstanding shows on the field, the team moves to Hamilton Tuesday for the battle of Seddon Park.         
	India lead the five-match series 2-0 after winning the third ODI here on Sunday. The series will be followed by a three-Test series. The first Test will be played in Hamilton.         
	New Zealand fast bowler Ian Butler, meanwhile, has been left out of the squad for the fourth ODI because of an injury.         
	Butler suffered a thigh strain during the third match in Christchurch and was able to bowl only five overs. However, he will be considered for the final match of the series in Auckland on March 14.         
	Ewen Thompson, the Central Districts allrounder who was part of New Zealands Twenty20 squad, has been included instead of Butler. Tim Southee, who went for 105 runs off his ten overs in Christchurch, has also been left out.         
	Daniel Vettori will return to the team after missing the third ODI. Peter McGlashan has also been retained as wicketkeeper and Brendon McCullum will continue to play as a batsman.

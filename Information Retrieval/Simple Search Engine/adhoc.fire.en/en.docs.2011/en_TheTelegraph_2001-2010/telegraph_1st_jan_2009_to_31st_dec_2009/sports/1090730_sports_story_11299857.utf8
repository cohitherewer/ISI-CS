The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BMW to withdraw from Formula One
                                                     BMW to withdraw from Formula One
            TOM CARY            Polish driver Robert Kubica and (right) German driver Nick Heidfeld                            
	London: BMW have confirmed they will withdraw from Formula One at the end of the current season.         
	An emergency press conference was called at the German car manufacturers headquarters Wednesday morning to make the announcement. BMW are the second major manufacturer to pull out of the sport in the space of eight months following Hondas withdrawal in December. Of course, this was a difficult decision for us, but its a resolute step in view of our companys strategic realignment, said Dr Norbert Reithofer, chairman of BMWs board of management.         
	Premium will be increasingly defined in terms of sustainability and environmental compatibility. This is an area in which we want to remain in the lead.We are continually reviewing all projects and initiatives to check them for future viability and sustainability. Our Formula One campaign is thus less a key promoter for us.         
	The fear is that BMWs departure could prompt other manufacturers, specifically Toyota but perhaps Renault as well, into making similar decisions.         
	It is a situation that the FIA, world motorsports governing body, feared from the moment Japanese car giant Honda dropped its bombshell last December that it was leaving F1 as a result of the global financial downturn.         
	With the FIA banging the cost-cutting drum, Hondas exit prompted the Formula One Teams Association (Fota) to agree to slash budgets by about a third for this season  an estimated $1 billion in total.         
	However, FIA president Max Mosleys attempts to pass a 40 million budget cap in May met with fierce resistance from Fota who threatened to form their own breakaway series.         
	BMWs exit is a crushing blow for the sport and for Bernie Ecclestone, the chief executive of Formula One Management.         
	It had been thought that all five remaining manufacturers would pledge themselves to the sport until 2012 by signing a new Concorde Agreement with CVC Ca pital Partners, the commercial rights holder, and the FIA.         
	The FIA announced only last week that the latest draft of the document was being assessed by their World Motor Sport Council and should be ready for signature by the end of this week, subject to confirmation that a satisfactory inter-team cost-reduction agreement is in place.         
	The German car manufacturer has suffered a frustrating season on the track, having started with high hopes of challenging for the title.         
	Last year Polish driver Robert Kubica was leading the championship at the halfway stage before the team dropped away in the latter stages. This time around Kubica has just two points to his name after 10 races, with German teammate Nick Heidfeld not much better off with six points.

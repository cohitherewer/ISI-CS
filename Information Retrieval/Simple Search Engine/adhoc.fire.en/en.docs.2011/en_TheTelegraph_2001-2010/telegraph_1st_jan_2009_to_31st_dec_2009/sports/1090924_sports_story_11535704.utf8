The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kimi fate hangs in balance 
                                                   Kimi fate hangs in balance 
                      
	Florence: Kimi Raikkonen is not assured of racing for Ferrari in Formula One next season, team president Luca di Montezemolo said on Wednesday.         
	Rumours have swirled for months that Raikkonen will be replaced by Renaults Fernando Alonso for next year despite the Finns contract with Ferrari running until the end of 2010.         
	Brazils Felipe Massa is poised to return for Ferrari next season after suffering a fractured skull in Julys Hungarian Grand Prix. We will have a Brazilian driver because he deserves another chance given that, thank God, he is fine, he said.         
	Ferrari had always previously said 2007 world champion Raikkonen was contracted for 2010 but had not gone as far as to stay he would drive for the Italian team.         
	Giancarlo Fisichella is filling in for the injured Massa for the rest of the year and will then be Ferraris reserve driver next season.           (REUTERS)

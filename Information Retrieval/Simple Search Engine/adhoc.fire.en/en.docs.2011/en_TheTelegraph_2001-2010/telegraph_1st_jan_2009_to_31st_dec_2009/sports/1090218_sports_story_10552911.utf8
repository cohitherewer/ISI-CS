                                                   Confident EB fancy chances 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengals Alvito DCunha feels the red and gold brigade badly need some luck to get over the Mohun Bagan jinx. Having failed to beat Bagan in their last nine encounters  seven losses and two draws  Alvito desperately wants lady luck to smile on them. We badly need luck. Most of the matches were close, but they had the last laugh. Think of the Fed Cup semi-final. We had a superb match and they won in tie-breakers! Alvito told The Telegraph.         
	East Bengal meet Mohun Bagan in a 16th round I-League match on February 22.         
	Alvito, though, says he has a feeling that this time they will be able to buck the trend. They are on a roll but our confidence also got a major boost after the convincing back-to-back victories against Air India and Vasco. And with (Sunil) Chetri and (Yusif) Yakubu in rousing form, I surely fancy our chances, he said.         
	Alvito agrees that the East Bengal players are under psychological pressure every time there was a match against the green and maroon brigade. It happens when you lose matches to a particular team for a certain period.         
	Defender Mehrajuddin Wadoo, however, says pressure will be on Mohun Bagan this time. They are chasing the title. And a fumble here or a stumble there might well jeopardise their chances. We, on the other hand, have nothing to lose. We just need to go there and play our normal game, the India international says.         
	Meanwhile, Mohun Bagans PC Lalampuiya, who has been admitted to a rehabilitation centre for alcohol-related problems, will attend the morning practice on Wednesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Super Kings look for ascendancy
                                                   Super Kings look for ascendancy
                      
	Port Elizabeth: Maintaining the momentum would be Royal Challengers Bangalores aim while Chennai Super Kings would seek to shrug off the disappointment of their first match defeat when the teams cross sword in Indian Premier League here Monday.         
	Under their new captain Kevin Pietersen, the Bangalore outfit made a statement of sorts Saturday when they humbled defending champions Rajasthan Royals by a whopping 75 runs, announcing they are ready to shed the laggards tag of last year.         
	Interestingly, Pietersen owes the morale-boosting win largely to the person he replaced at the top and Rahul Dravid stood testimony to the fact that a player need not be ugly and go bang-bang all along to succeed in the Twenty20 format.         
	Dravids cultured 66 was the cornerstone of the Bangalore innings against the Royals while Pietersen contributed his mite as well.         
	But from the team point of view, Jesse Ryder, Robin Uthappa and Ross Taylor failed to make early impression and Pietersen would hope that the trio would come all guns blazing Sunday.         
	Fortunately, there seems to be no such worry in the bowling department where Anil Kumble, like Dravid, proved that Twenty20 is not necessarily a youngsters game and that experience has no alternative.         
	Kumbles five-for against the Royals proved that the seasoned leggie may have retired from international cricket but is still good enough to make life difficult for any batsman.         
	Praveen Kumar and Dale Steyn did an excellent job in the pace department while Jesse Ryders military medium pace also proved effective.         
	In contrast, the mood is somewhat sombre in the Chennai camp after Mahendra Singh Dhonis men went down to Mumbai Indians in the tournament opener.         
	Apart from Hayden and Dhoni, none of the batsmen could really do any justice to their reputations and Andrew Flintoff was largely ineffective with both ball and bat.         
	Flintoff did get the start but could not convert it, while Jacob Oram let the side down.         
	Even the Indian youngsters  Parthiv Patel, Suresh Raina and S. Badrinath  came a cropper and Dhoni can only hope that they would not repeat their mistakes.         
	Not that Chennai bowlers did any better. Apart from Joginder Sharma, even the containing job proved to be beyond Dhonis bowlers.           (PTI)

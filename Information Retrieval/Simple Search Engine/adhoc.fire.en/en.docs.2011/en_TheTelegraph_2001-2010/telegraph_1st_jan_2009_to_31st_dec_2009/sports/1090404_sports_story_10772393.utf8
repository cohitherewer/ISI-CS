                                                   England bat vs WI
                      
	Gros Islet (St. Lucia): England, after being sent in to bat, were 52 for one after nine overs at midnight in the fifth and final one-dayer against the West Indies on Friday.         
	The match at Beausejour Stadium was reduced to 29 overs per side after heavy overnight and morning rain waterlogged the outfield and delayed the start. (Agencies)

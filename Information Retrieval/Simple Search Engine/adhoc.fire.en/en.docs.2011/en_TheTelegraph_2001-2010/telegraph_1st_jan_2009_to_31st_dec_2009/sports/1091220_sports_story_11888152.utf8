The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bose to quit at end of season
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bose to quit at end of season
            A STAFF REPORTER            Gopal Bose                           
	Calcutta: Bengal under-19 coach Gopal Bose, expressing dissatisfaction with the functioning of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), on Saturday said that he has decided to quit the job at the end of the season.         
	Its very difficult to continue with the job. I have made up my mind that this is my last year as the Bengal under-19 coach and Ill quit at the end of the season, the veteran coach told The Telegraph.         
	Apart from having overall dissatisfaction with the system, Bose was further miffed on Saturday when Arijit Banerjee, a Bengal under-19 medium pacer, was called for suspect action by the on-field umpires during their Cooch Behar Trophy match against Haryana, currently underway at Deshbandhu Park.         
	This is the second instance that an under-19 player has been called for suspect action. Sambit Roy, a right-arm off-spinner, has already been ruled out after he was called in our match against Andhra. And now its Arijit So, we are already two bowlers short. A team cant be organised if things carry on like this, said Bose.         
	Arijit was in the senior Bengal probables list. Its strange that the local umpires have cleared him so far, maybe because of the pressure of the club officials. I know these follies are part of the system but its very difficult to do justice to the job under the present circumstances, Bose rued.         
	CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey, however, said that the association had little to do in this regard. Arijit has played under-19 matches in the last season as well. None of the umpires reported him. So how can we stop him from bowling if there are no reports?         
	Asked if they had received any indications from the team management regarding Arijits action, Dey answered in the negative. People are saying now that they suspected his action earlier too. But no one submitted a written report and we cant act unless we receive something in writing, Dey said.         
	However, Bose cited more problems with the CAB.         
	Saying that the CAB should prepare a list of probables as early as June-July, Bose said: There has to be some effort from the CABs part to see that things are run smoothly. Coaches at all levels should get a list of players by June-July, and not just before the season. They will then have ample time to have a look at the players. This has been a problem with all the coaches. These are the problems why we havent done well recently.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dilshan: Its even at the moment
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dilshan: Its even at the moment
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Tillekaratne Dilshan Wednesday wished that the referral system had been in place for the present series versus India. The Lanka opener was out to a dubious decision when he looked set for a bigger knock, on 109.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	The match         
	Its very even right now. The wicket is not easy to bat on there is a lot of turn and bounce.         
	Sri Lankan game plan         
	First, we should pass the 400 mark. With Angelo (Mathews) in good nick, we can do that.         
	His two centuries in the series         
	Definitely this was the better knock. The wicket in the first Test was flat, but here it was challenging. I had to leave a lot of deliveries. They (India) bowled really well but after the first 10 overs I felt easy and started to play my strokes.         
	The referral system not being used         
	Definitely Had the referral system been there, I would be still batting.         
	Opening the innings         
	In Tests, the captain and selectors wanted me to open to balance the side so that Angelo Mathews could come in at No.6 as an all-rounder. For the sake of the team, I agreed.         
	His form this year         
	I had a great start in Bangladesh (where he scored two hundreds in the Chittagong Test). I hope to carry on in the same way.         
	Muttiah Muralidharan         
	He will enjoy the bounce and turn. He can do some damage in the next couple of days.

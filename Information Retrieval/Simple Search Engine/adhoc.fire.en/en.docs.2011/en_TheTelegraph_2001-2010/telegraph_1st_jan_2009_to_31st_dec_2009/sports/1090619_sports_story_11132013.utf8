The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav debuts off the field today
                                                   Sourav debuts off the field today
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	London: Ill say what I see, former India captain Sourav Ganguly told The Telegraph on the eve of beginning his innings as a TV commentator.         
	Sourav starts on Friday, during semi-final No. 2 of the World T20, between Sri Lanka and the West Indies.         
	Its disappointing that Indias out of the tournament... It wouldve been nice to begin this innings with an India match, Sourav added.         
	Asked if hed sought the guidance of any veteran, Sourav replied: No... I know this is new for me... Im looking forward to the experience...         
	Another former India captain, Anil Kumble, made his debut earlier in the World T20. I didnt hear a lot of anybodys commentary, but Anil was good, Sourav remarked.         
	Sourav will be picking and choosing assignments as he doesnt want to return to the days of being on the road just about all the time.

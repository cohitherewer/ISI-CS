The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chetri to start training next week
                                                   Chetri to start training next week
                      
	New Delhi: Striker Sunil Chetri is expected to start training from next week in Barcelona where the Indian football team is undergoing a month-long preparatory camp for the Nehru Cup in August.         
	Chetri, who has been out of action since last month due to a recurrence of his old right ankle injury, has been restricted to light training but team manager Pradip Chowdhury said the Dempo player is likely to join the rest of his teammates in practice by next week.         
	The advice from the team doctor is that Chetri will do only light training now. He is shaping up well and is likely to start training by next week, Chowdhary said.         
	Defender Surkumar Singh, who was also nursing an injury, is back in action. Surkumar is fine now and he is back in action, the team manager said.         
	Meanwhile, after two days of training, the whole Indian contingent, barring chief coach Bob Houghton, had a feel of the Catalan city on Sunday.         
	They visited Sagrada Familia Roman Catholic church, a top tourist attraction in Barcelona, besides spending time at a few shopping centres.         
	The players have had two outdoor training sessions so far though they have been spending time in the gym and pool every morning since they landed in Barcelona. (PTI)

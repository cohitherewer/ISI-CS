The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger, Phil provide drama
                                                   Tiger, Phil provide drama
    - World no. 1 amp; 2 show what Augusta masters is all about             Bill Pennington                            
	Augusta: Tiger Woods walked onto the first tee Sunday amid a clamorous ovation, and Phil Mickelson, who minutes earlier had received a similar greeting, did not so much as turn around. The two golfers stood no more than three feet apart for a few seconds until they almost accidentally turned toward each other.         
	The handshake that followed was frosty and perfunctory, like something two unfriendly neighbours might exchange at church with the pastor watching. But things heated up considerably from there.         
	Several strokes from contention at the start of the day, Woods and Mickelson teed off well before the leaders in the final round of the 2009 Masters and finished well before them, too. For a little more than four hours in between, they brought the drama of a heavyweight championship fight to Augusta National, stealing centre stage and captivating a voracious gallery that never seemed to know whom to root for more.         
	Mickelson, the world No. 2, won the front nine in this pseudo match with a stirring charge of remarkable golf, but Woods counter-punched to take the back nine with steely putting. Both pulled to a shot off the lead at some point. In the end, neither was needed for the green jacket ceremony, but there was no escaping the championship drama they brought to the Masters.         
	World No. 1 Woods, a four-time winner here, finished four strokes back at eight under par. Mickelson, a two-time Masters champion, was one better.         
	In what might have been an indication of how pitched the rivalry is between them, or an indication of how differently they approach the game and the rivalry, Mickelson was happy afterward, calling it one of the most fun days he has had in a tournament. He happily recounted his round for reporters for 15 minutes.         
	Woods, meanwhile, was distressed and referred to his day as terrible. He talked with reporters for 90 seconds. I was hitting it awful on the range before the round and then I went out to the first tee and hit one of the worst tee shots Ive ever hit, Woods said.         
	Woodss first tee shot was so far left, it flew over the trees guarding the edge of the first hole and over the fairway of the adjacent ninth hole until it settled in the right rough of that hole. That kind of told me what was going on out there for me, Woods said. But I tried to make something of it. I almost won the tournament with a Band-Aid swing.         
	Woods managed to make par on the first hole, birdied the second hole and made eagle on the par-5 eighth hole. But mostly, he was a spectator to the Mickelson show during the front nine. Mickelson made six birdies in his first nine, which he completed in 30 strokes.         
	Mickelson was hitting his approach shots close, and the Augusta National greens seemed soft and receptive. On the seventh hole, his drive hugged the tree line. From a precarious position from which he could barely see the green, he hit a soaring 40-yard hook to the green with the ball coming to rest 3 feet from the hole. He made that putt and then birdied the eighth hole to get to 10 under for the tournament, one stroke behind one of the eventual runners-up, Kenny Perry, and tied with the eventual winner, ngel Cabrera.         
	The Masters gallery, full of khaki shorts and sundresses, was busy cheering both golfers, but not necessarily equally. Masters fans have not had to choose between these two in the same group on the final day for eight years. But with Mickelson playing better, he, for maybe the first time ever here, was receiving the louder ovations.         
	By the 12th hole, Mickelson was still very much in the hunt. Then he hit his tee shot at the devilish 12th short and it rolled back in the water. He made double bogey. The wrong swing at the wrong time, he said.         
	But Mickelson did not truly squander his chances at a third Masters title until the 15th hole, where he had a four-foot putt for an eagle that would have tied him for the lead. He missed left, his ball never touching the hole. I did not trust the read and hit it tentative, he said.         
	He had a birdie putt of similar length on the 17th hole and missed that as well. On the 18th hole, he was in the bunker and did not get it near the green, chunking it short, which led to a bogey.         
	Woods was having his own troubles. With birdies on the 15th and 16th holes, he also got his score as low as 10 under. He then hit his tee shot in the woods alongside the 17th fairway and bogeyed. On No. 18, he was in the trees again and closed with another bogey.         
	This match of golf royals  rivals but not buddies  that had started with so much intensity concluded with a flourish of inconsistent golf. Mickelson finished fifth and Woods tied for sixth.         
	Its one of the more frustrating weeks Ive had, said Woods, who no doubt meant it since he has seemed in an intemperate mood for the last few days. I hit the ball terrible out there.         
	Then he briskly walked off.         
	Mickelson, more diplomatic, put on a sunny face. Playing with Tiger was fun, he said. Weve had some good matches. I always enjoy it.         
	He was not alone.                 NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Guwahati: Theres no stopping Lajong FC.         
	On Wednesday, the greenhorns from Shillong created one of the biggest upsets in Indian football when they defeated I-League champions Churchill Brothers 1-0 in the first semi-final of the Hero Honda 31st Federation Cup at the Nehru Stadium, here. S Tuboi scored the all-important goal in the 29th minute.         
	For the record, it was Lajongs maiden appearance in the main round of the blue riband tournament and they will face either East Bengal or Mohun Bagan during the final on January 3.         
	Churchill started the match on a confident note. But Lajong soaked in the early pressure and started catching the Churchill defence off-guard on the break.         
	In the 29th minute, Tuboi latched onto a pass from foreign recruit James Gbilee and before Rowilson Rodrigues and Naoba Singh could close him down, he slotted it past goalkeeper Lalit Thapa.         
	On Wednesday, Lajong had another hero in Gumpe Rime. The veteran goalkeeper saved an Odafe penalty to keep Lajong in the hunt.         
	In the 35th minute, defender Ailad Kinta brought down Odafe inside the box and the referee had no hesitation in pointing to the dreaded spot. Odafe, who probably got unnerved by the vociferous crowd, made a feeble attempt and Rime anticipated correctly to save the shot.

	Lajong FC: Gumpe Rime, Daniel Bidemi, Ailad Kinta, Samson Ramengwawia, James Gbilee, Niwan Gatphoh, Boithang Haokip, S Tuboi, Anil Gurung, Wailadmi Passah, Kirshan Lyngshing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Symonds: Had given up hope
                                                   Symonds: Had given up hope
                      
	Melbourne: Troubled Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds said he had all but given up hopes of reviving his sliding career before the match-winning knock against Pakistan brought back some of the lost confidence.         
	The burly Queenslander said the effort has re-instilled some of the confidence that had been shattered by a series of off-field misdemeanours and on-field failures.         
	In the first game I got out and I thought Gee, theres one down, Ive got possibly five to go. Thats how I was looking at it. I did feel like that, Symonds was quoted as saying by an Australian agency here. It was a very important innings for me.

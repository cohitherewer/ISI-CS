The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mumbai tighten grip as UP falter on Day 3
                                                     Mumbai tighten grip as UP falter on Day 3

	Hyderabad: Zaheer Khans seven-wicket haul broke Uttar Pradeshs back as Mumbai tightened their grip on the Ranji Trophy final and ended Day III with an overall lead of 287 runs.         
	Resuming on 91 for three, UP batsmen, barring the notable exceptions of Shivakant Shukla (99) and Bhuvneshwar Kumar (41), wilted in the face of some quality fast bowling from Zaheer and folded up for 245 to concede a first innings lead of 157 runs on Wednesday.         
	To make matters worse for UP, Mumbai, in their second essay, cruised to 130 for no loss at stumps with captain Wasim Jaffer (74) and Vinayak Samant (53) going great guns.         
	Zaheer finished with an impressive figure of 27.2-14-54-7, his second successive fiver in the tournament.         
	Umpiring, however, remained a matter of concern as Shukla fell to a dubious leg before decision just one run away from a well-deserved century.         
	The dismissal triggered UPs batting collapse.         
	Zaheer has troubled every world class batsman of late with his pace and movement but to their credit, overnight batsmen Shukla and Parvinder Singh (22) negotiated him well.         
	Parvinder sustained a painful blow from Zaheer on his forearm but still did not flinch. His patience, however, wore thin before lunch as threw away his wicket chasing a wide Abhishek Nayar delivery.         
	Shukla found an ally in Bhuvneshwar and the duo added 68 runs for the fifth wicket before Zaheer, who was posing problems for the batsmen with his reverse swing, hit back with the new ball.         
	Zaheer wreaked havoc in his second spell with the second new ball, claiming five middle and lower order batsmen for just 20 runs as UP, from 214 for four, collapsed for 245.         
	The Indian spearhead started the rot when he ended Shuklas 393-minute vigil by trapping him leg before. Shukla was distinctly unlucky as the ball hit the flap of the pad well above the knee-roll and it was a sad end to his patient 266-ball knock which included 14 hits to the fence.         
	Zaheer then went on to remove Praveen Kumar (6) and Amir Khan (0) off successive balls.         
	Though a hattrick eluded him, Zaheer returned to remove Piyush Chawla (18) and Praveen Gupta (0), again in successive deliveries, in his next over to drop curtains on the UP innings.         
	UPs misery continued as Mumbais second innings got off to a resounding start with openers Jaffer and Samant deciding to complement the effort of their bowlers.         
	Both Jaffer and Samant milked the jaded UP attack with consummate ease and the nearest they were to a setback was when Bhuvneshwar could not latch on to the ball after Jaffer had driven it uppishly back to the bowler.         
	Jaffers unbeaten 108-ball knock included 12 hits to the fence while Samant struck eight fours en route to his unbeaten 111-ball innings.         
	Jaffer run of scores in the Ranji Trophy is sure to put him in running for selection to the national side when the selectors meet to pick the squad for the New Zealand tour.

            A CORRESPONDENT            Gautam Gambhir en route to his 167 in Wellington on Sunday. (AFP)                           
	Wellington: A lead of over 600 runs and five sessions of bowling time would be enough for India to clinch the third Test and the series against New Zealand, in-form opener Gautam Gambhir said Sunday.         
	The left-hander, who struck a fluent 257-ball 167 in the second innings, rated the match-saving marathon 137 in the second Test in Napier as the best century in his 25-Test-old career.         
	At the end of the third day, India are ahead by 531 runs. Rahul Dravid (60) and VVS Laxman (61) were the other notable performers. Yuvraj Singh (15) and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (16) were at the crease.               
	The following are excerpts         
	If the innings was satisfying         
	When I was in Sri Lanka, I remember when I got my 150, I was asked this question about how challenging it would be in New Zealand as an opening batsman So I think it was a big challenge for me on my first foreign tour away from the sub-continent. Very satisfying.         
	Toning down aggression after reaching his hundred         
	Its all about partnerships. We lost Sachin (Tendulkar), then I had to build a partnership with VVS Laxman which was very important from the teams point of view We had a lot of time on our hand as well. We wanted to play New Zealand out of this Test match and it was very important for us to have partnerships, thats why I changed gears.         
	Missing out on the double hundred         
	I was thinking that its going to be very special to get a double hundred in New Zealand. I was very happy with the way I was hitting the ball and seeing it but just missed it I think I played a bad shot. Its very disappointing, I wanted to get a double hundred.         
	How he rates this century         
	The most important and satisfying century in my career was the one in Napier because we had to play for two-and-a-half days which is always tough in any condition, even if the wicket is flat. Its hard to play seven sessions so that was very satisfying and gave me a lot of confidence coming into this Test match. When things are going your way you should try and make it count as much as possible, and I believe in that because you never know when the bad form is round the corner.         
	The reasons for his good form         
	I am much more comfortable and much more secure in the side, which is very important for any cricketer. Till the time youre playing for your place in the side its always tough you dont play your natural game. But once you start feeling secure and start feeling that you belong to this arena, it becomes much easier. Then you go out there and play your natural game.         
	The turning point of his career         
	My turning point in Test cricket was the Sri Lanka series, where I was making my comeback. Specially scoring runs in Sri Lanka against (Ajanatha) Mendis, (Muttiah) Muralidharan and (Chaminda) Vaas gave me a lot of confidence. I thought I am gonna get a longer run after that series. Then getting into the Australia series and getting a double hundred in Delhi was a very big moment for me. Since then I have always been there and dont take any innings casually because every innings is important Cant afford to take my place for granted. I always start on zero and dont carry the hundred in the previous match into the next innings.         
	The team performance         
	We are an aggressive side and have shown that in the past. We have won six or seven series in a row when it comes to one-dayers and Tests. Weve dominated this series as well, have won in Hamilton, played seven sessions in Napier I think as we all know we are a much better side and if we can win this series 2-0 its going to be a very big achievement To win a series here after 41 years will be the icing on the cake.         
	The wicket         
	There is a bit of up and down stuff now Its turning and the way Bhajji bowled in the first innings... Its only gonna get worse from here on. It will be very challenging for New Zealand .         
	On when the team would declare         
	We might play a little bit in the morning.         
	The game plan         
	If we can set New Zealand over 600 runs they will be out of this Test match and will only be playing to survive rather than winning. We want to get them into a situation where they will only think of surviving rather than chasing runs. Once they get into that mindset of just defending, it will be very difficult from them.         
	If India can win this Test         
	Weve got two days on our hands and the kind of bowling that we have, we can easily get New Zealand out in five sessions. If we cant do that, then we dont deserve to win this Test match.

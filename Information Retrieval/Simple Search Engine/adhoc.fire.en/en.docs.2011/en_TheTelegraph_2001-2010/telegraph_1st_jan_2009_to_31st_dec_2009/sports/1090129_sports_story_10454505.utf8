                                                     Calm Dhoni sees India through
    - Oldie Sanath Jayasuriyas 28th ODI century goes in vain                   Gautam Gambhir in action in Dambulla on Wednesday. (AP)                           
	Dambulla: An unflappable Mahendra Singh Dhoni led by example as India relied on a clinical all-round display to thrash Sri Lanka by six wickets and take a 1-0 lead in the five-match ODI series here Wednesday.         
	Chasing 247, India rode substantial contributions from Gautam Gambhir and Suresh Raina before losing both of them but Dhoni (61 not out) was his composed self, guiding the team to victory with 11 balls to spare.         
	Sanath Jayasuriyas 28th ODI century went in vain as the Indians never allowed the islanders to break loose on a slow track. Kumar Sangakkara contributed 44 as the hosts posted 246 for seven wickets.         
	Both the teams now move to Colombo for the second match on Saturday. This was Indias sixth ODI win in a row, coming after their 5-0 whitewash of England at home.         
	With a hip injury keeping Virender Sehwag out of action and Sachin Tendulkar back in the hut in the fourth over, the chase on a sluggish track was far from easy. But with Gambhir and Raina on song, India hardly had a reason to worry.         
	The left-handed duo put on a 113-run stand for the second wicket that laid the perfect foundation for a successful chase, besides offsetting the setback of losing Tendulkar early in the innings.         
	Thilana Thusharas ball had pitched outside leg stump before striking Tendulkar on his pad and Kumar Dharmasena, making his ODI debut as an umpire, took his time before upholding the vociferous appeal.         
	The Gambhir and Raina partnership laid the platform for the other batsmen as the visitors chased down the highest-ever total at this venue which has so far hosted 26 matches. Gambhir and Raina, however, were a trifle lucky.         
	Early in his innings, a diving Nuwan Kulasekara apparently caught Gambhir off his own bowling but repeated replays proved inconclusive and the Delhi left-hander was given the benefit of doubt. Raina was spilled at point by Tillekeratne Dilshan off Thushara when he was on seven.         
	But once they got their eyes in, there was no stopping them. Gambhir milked the Lankan attack with consummate ease and often stepped out to unsettle them. A streaky boundary off Dilshan brought up his 50 but his audacious bid to hit Muttiah Muralidharan out of the park saw him perish at long-off.         
	Raina, who had hit Nuwan Kulasekara for a couple of fours and a six in one over, completed his 50 as well but lost his wicket going for a non-existent second run.         
	Yuvraj Singh (23) looked ill at ease against the Lankan spinners, especially Ajantha Mendis, but it was Farveez Maharoof who removed the left-hander.         
	Dhoni and Rohit Sharma (25 not out) played sensibly to guide the team to victory.         
	Earlier, Dhoni won an important toss at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium and asked the hosts to take first strike, and Jayasuriya proved he still has it in him to excel at the highest level.         
	A perennial thorn in Indias flesh, Jayasuriyas 28th ODI century was studded with 10 fours and a six off Pragyan Ojha.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Churchill must wait
                                                   Churchill must wait
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Churchill Brothers failed to seal the I-League title by conceding a late goal in an edgy 1-1 draw against Air India at the Cooperage here on Saturday.         
	The Goan team had one hand on the trophy at half-time after Felix Chimaokwu gave them the lead with a stoppage-time strike. With Sporting Clube de Goa and Mohun Bagan, the other title contenders, also being held by their respective rivals at various venues, preserving that one-goal advantage would sufficed the league leaders.         
	But thanks to some terrible goalkeeping by Churchills Arindam Bhattacharya, Air India ruined the Goan teams party through an 89th minute equaliser from Emmanuel Ovieghara.         
	The outcome of the match would send shivers down Churchills spine who narrowly lost the title to Dempo last season. Dempo triumphed by virtue of a better goal difference.         
	Churchill now have 43 points from 21 games, three ahead of Sporting Clube. Bagan have 37 but the Calcutta club have played two games less than the Goan teams.         
	So, the title is still Churchills to lose as a win against Mohammedan Sporting at home in the final round  the date of which is yet to be finalised  would make them the champions, irrespective of what happens in other matches.         
	It was clear that the visitors, with the trophy in grabbing distance, were nervous as they struggled to strike a rhythm. Credit, however, should go to Bimal Ghoshs men, who too were under the pressure of avoiding relegation, for the way they kept Odafe Okolie and Co. in check.         
	The contrasting characters of the two teams were summed up by the performance of their custodians, Bhattacharya and Arup Debnath. Debnath was grit personified, as he guarded the Air India citadel for the most of second half with an ankle injury and came up with some solid saves.         
	On the other hand, Bhattacharya was a nervous wreck. The visiting goalie, who also earned a yellow card, was way out of his line  apparently in an attempt to collect a long ball from Air India  and left his teammates stranded as Emmanuel headed the equaliser with minutes to go for the whistle.

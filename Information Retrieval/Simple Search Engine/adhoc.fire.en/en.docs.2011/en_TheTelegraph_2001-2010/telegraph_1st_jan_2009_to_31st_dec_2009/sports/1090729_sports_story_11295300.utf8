	Roseau (Dominica): Travis Dowlin hit an unbeaten 100 Tuesday to set up the West Indies total of 274/6 in the second one-day International against Bangladesh.               
	At midnight, Bangladesh were 45 without loss in 10 overs. Junaid Siddique (23) and Tamim Iqbal (21) were at the crease               
	The 32-year-old Dowlin, playing only his second ODI, struck six fours and a six off 117 balls at Windsor Park. He paced his innings superbly, with his first 50 taking 88 deliveries before he smashed another 50 off his next 29 balls. He also put on a second-wicket stand of 66 with Devon Smith, who made 44.         
	David Bernard, Rawl Lewis and Darren Sammy provided robust contributions late in the innings.         
	Off-spinner Naeem Islam was the best of the visitors bowlers, returning figures of one for 26 off eight overs.         
	The West Indies, trailing 0-1 in the three-match series, got off to an encouraging start after winning the toss and electing to bat. Dale Richards and Andre Fletcher added 33 in the first five overs but Bangladesh struck back once spin was introduced.

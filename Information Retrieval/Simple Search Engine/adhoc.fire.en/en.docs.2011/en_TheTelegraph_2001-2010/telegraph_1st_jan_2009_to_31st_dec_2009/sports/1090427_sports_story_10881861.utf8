The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahindra coach
                                                   Mahindra coach
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The trio of David Booth, Henry Menzes and Arshad Hussain, who quit Mumbai FC on Thursday, joined Mahindra United on Sunday.         
	While Booth will be replacing Derrick Pereira as the chief coach, Arshad will be his deputy. Menzes will be the football manager of the former national league champions. Mahindra United, who finished fifth in the recently-concluded I-League, gave Pereira the boot after a lackadaisical performance.

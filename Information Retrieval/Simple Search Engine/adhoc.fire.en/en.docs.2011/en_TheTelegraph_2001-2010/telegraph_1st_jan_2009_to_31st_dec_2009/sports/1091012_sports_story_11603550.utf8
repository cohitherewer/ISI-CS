The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Coulthard burns up the track
                                                     Coulthard burns up the track
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Former F1 driver David Coulthard on the Bandra-Worli Sea Link during a promotional in Mumbai on Sunday. (Reuters)                           
	Mumbai: There were the traffic sergeants, the citys top crime busters, and hovering above in a helicopter, the Navy patrol. Still, none bothered to book the driver when he vroomed at 260 kmph  much greater than the permissible speed limit of 100 kmph  on the Bandra-Worli Sea Link.         
	On any other day, the law enforcement agencies might have responded differently. But on Sunday, as the driver brought his car to a halt and stepped out, they applauded in unison with the bystanders and, later, even took pictures with him.         
	It can happen, if the man behind the wheel happens to be a certain David Coulthard.         
	I didnt mean to do it (over-speed), it just happened, the man in question said with a chuckle, without the slightest trace of guilt.         
	Expectedly, the couple of hundred fans in the temporary paddock went up in a roar of approval.         
	The track was bumpy and the car, although powered by a V10 Cosworth engine, was four seasons old. Yet it didnt stop the 38-year-old Scot from pressing the pedal a little harder than warranted.         
	The Sea Link was longer than expected and I am not very good at judging the speed. Unfortunately I over-heated the engine, Coulthard said.         
	Although that cut-short his rendezvous at the citys latest landmark to just one lap on the eight-kilometre stretch, Coulthard made up for that and delighted the fans by doing a couple of doughnuts  360 degree spins.         
	Later, Coulthard, known to be outspoken, turned the heat on Indias sports minister, M.S. Gill, who had said he didnt consider Formula One a sport.         
	Its unfortunate that your sports minister doesnt understand Formula One is clearly a sport, he said. Its a high-tech sport, not on the playground because it involves so many aspects If India wants to showcase its engineering, design and work skills, F1 is the best place for that.         
	The words are sure to send ripples down all the way to New Delhi.

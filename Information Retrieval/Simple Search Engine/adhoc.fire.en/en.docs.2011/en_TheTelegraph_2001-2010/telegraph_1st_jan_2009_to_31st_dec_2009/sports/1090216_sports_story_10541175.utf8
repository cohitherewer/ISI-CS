The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Smith: We have the upper hand
                                                   Smith: We have the upper hand
                      
	Johannesburg: Australia will be under pressure when they arrive in South Africa on Monday, according to skipper Graeme Smith. Australia will play three Tests, five ODIs and two Twenty20 Internationals in their two-month tour.         
	South Africa will be the favourites after their recent triumphs in both the Test and ODI series in Australia.         
	Smith warned though that he expects an Australian backlash. Its going to be an unusual place to be for a South African team, said Smith. Its a great feeling and a reward for all the sacrifices everyone has made. But we know that Australians are very competitive. The only way we can keep them there is by playing better cricket again.         
	The side that Ricky Ponting will lead is one of the most inexperienced Australian touring parties and Smith said they would lack the confidence that previous sides had on the second leg of the back-to-back tours that have been the norm for South Africa-Australia contests.

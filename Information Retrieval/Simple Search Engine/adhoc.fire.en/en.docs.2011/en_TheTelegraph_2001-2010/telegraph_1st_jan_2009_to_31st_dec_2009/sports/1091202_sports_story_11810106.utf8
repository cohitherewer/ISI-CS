  - We hope to exploit Gautam Gambhirs absence, says Sri Lanka captain         OUR CORRESPONDENT            Kumar Sangakkara in Mumbai on Tuesday. (AFP)                                 
	Mumbai: Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara Tuesday said his side would try and exploit the absence of the prolific Gautam Gambhir in the third and final Test.                 
	The following are excerpts               
	Waiting for a first Test win in India         
	There is still a great opportunity. We had a good first Test but a not-so-good second one. Now we have to regroup. We have the make-up of a team that can beat any side in the world.         
	Missed chances         
	We created a few chances in the first Test, when we used the new ball well. But creating chances and taking them are entirely different We have to start from scratch. The important thing is to limit the Indians to a manageable total.         
	Muralidharans form         
	He is a bowler who has done so much. If hes had an off day, thats the way cricket is. I have no worries about him. He is a quality bowler and we have to back that quality. He is still our spearhead.         
	Murali talking about retiring         
	He has been talking about it for the last two years. He is being realistic and we respect him for that.         
	Angelo Mathews falling short of expectations         
	He is a quality player. He has come into the national side after a lot of hard work in the A side. He has done well in all forms of the game. If he has failed in a couple of games, it doesnt mean he is a bad player. When we pick a player in the eleven, we show faith in him.         
	The toss         
	It had more influence in the second Test, not the first. I dont know how its going to be here. But its always good to win the toss.         
	Damika Prasads replacement         
	Nuwan Kulasekera has been an asset to us. Quality-wise he has the edge. Dilhara Fernando is making a comeback and has been bowling well at nets. Its a tough choice...         
	The bowling combination         
	Will probably pick an extra fast bowler over a spinner.         
	In Kanpur, there was a lot of wear and tear in the pitch, but that doesnt look to be the case here That means Ajantha Mendis will miss out.         
	Gambhirs absence         
	We hope to exploit that... It leaves a gap but the new guy coming would be hungry.

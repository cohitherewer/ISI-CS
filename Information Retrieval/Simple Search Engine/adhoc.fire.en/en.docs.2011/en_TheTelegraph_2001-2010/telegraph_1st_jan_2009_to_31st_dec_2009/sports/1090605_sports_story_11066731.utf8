                                                   John: Players will now have to adapt to longer versions
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Nottingham: Australian John Buchanan, the only coach with two (50-over) World Cups under his belt, spoke to The Telegraph in the lead-up to edition No.2 of the World T20, which begins on Friday.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q Is cricket actually ready for another major T20 event, beginning less than a fortnight after the IPL?         
	A It is at the moment, due to the interest generated by the IPL. However, in my opinion, this will not be maintained in the long term unless the games administrators manage correctly the three products they have  Test matches, a country vs country limited-overs form and a city vs city or a region vs region franchised T20 format.         
	Do you fear a T20 overkill, as experienced in the 50-over game?         
	Yes, if administrators make poor decisions about when, where and how T20 fits into the overall programming of cricket.         
	Two thoughts are doing the rounds: (a) That most of the players are actually fatigued after a gruelling IPL and (b) that most have still gained by such exposure in the lead-up to the World T20. Whats your take?         
	Both are correct. Many of those from India, Australia, South Africa and Sri Lanka, who played the entire tournament, had already come from busy international schedules... Physically, many players were tired... By the end of the IPL most of them, even if they werent carrying some injury requiring attention by the physios and masseurs, were mentally fatigued due to the constant playing, travelling and the intensity of the tournament. The up side, though, is that if in the few days between the IPL and the start of the World T20, they were able to give sufficient attention to their physical ailments as well as get some mental rest (time away from the hype and cricket itself), then they will enter the competition in very good shape. I say so as their respective games have been match-hardened to the needs of T20.         
	Among the top nations, only players from Pakistan didnt play in the IPL. Do the 2007 runners-up start with a distinct disadvantage?         
	Their disadvantage will be the lack of match-hardness for T20... Their advantage is that they are relatively fresh and eager for cricket. I am sure eager too to show the rest that Pakistan must continue to be part of world cricket. In this mindset, Pakistan will always be dangerous.         
	The leading contenders would, in your opinion, be?         
	As we have seen through the IPL, it is nearly impossible to predict who can win a T20 tournament, especially with a knockout format. One team may get going early, only to lose one game, in the semi-final. Other teams may sneak into the semi-finals, with one winning the two matches from there! One ball can make a significant difference in T20 cricket... One poor decision by the umpire can be game-changing. On both counts, you only have to ask the Knight Riders... I favour India, South Africa, Sri Lanka and possibly Pakistan going through to the semi-finals. Australia, the West Indies and New Zealand are good outside bets. Because of the World T20 being held at home, Id put England too in that category.         
	Some words on each of your top four teams...         
	India: They are attempting to retain the trophy, which isnt an easy task... Good leadership, explosive batting all the way to number seven or eight and a very good mixture of bowling with pace (left and right-arm), spin (all varieties), and being good in the field are pluses. All players were involved with the IPL, which could be an advantage...I dont, of course, have an update on injuries.         
	South Africa: Very much the same as India, without quite the same bowling strength or ability in the field.         
	Sri Lanka: Lack the true power-hitters of other teams, but have some very capable upper-order batsmen. Their strength lies in experience, leadership, all-rounders and lead bowlers.         
	Pakistan: They have always had players who can light up a stadium and, at the same time, put the dimmers on the crowd... They have quality batsmen, big hitters, depth in batting and bowling... Their unpredictability makes them dangerous.         
	Who would you pick as the players likely to impact big in the World T20?         
	Kevin Pietersen, in front of home crowds, could be one to watch... India boast danger men in (Virender) Sehwag, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh and Yusuf Pathan... Will (Lasith) Malinga be able to reproduce his spells of the early rounds in the IPL? Plus his left-arm bowling partners may be interesting to watch... Dirk Nannes from The Netherlands will make teams earn their victories... If (Chris) Gayle, Dwayne Bravo and Fidel Edwards can deliver, then the West Indies will be potent... Similarly, can both AB de Villiers and (Jean-Paul) Duminy reproduce their IPL performances?         
	What makes the difference in T20?         
	One ball is almost 1% of an innings and one over is 5% of that innings  incredibly more significant to winning and losing a game compared to the other forms... Batsmen generally have the licence to take more risks than normal, which places bowlers under incredible scrutiny, knowing that one ball or one over can win or lose a game.         
	Is T20, then, the biggest lottery around?         
	It is still somewhat of a lottery as evidenced in the IPLs just-ended edition, but there are now clear patterns emerging on how to play the game in a manner to have the best chance of results. Players, though, still need to be able to deliver their skills at the right moment, thereby allowing their teams to place themselves in winning positions.         
	Why is Australias T20 record (11 wins, 10 losses) so mediocre?         
	Selectors do not pick T20 specialists, rather they choose players who can play this form and other forms of the game. In other words, Australia (although not the only country) does not see this format as being as important as the limited (50) overs game and Test cricket.         
	Frankly, how much can cricketers gain by playing T20?         
	World cricket is in transition. Historically, we have been brought up on the long game (Test, three and four-day cricket). In the Seventies, the world was introduced to the limited-overs form, to which players and spectators alike adapted. We are now seeing, possibly for another five years or so, spectators, our youth cricketers and consumers such as the media being brought up on the short game (T20 or derivatives)... It will require players who wish to play all forms  and most will  to adapt to the longer versions. In other words, move from the short game to the long one.         
	What would the last IPL have taught coaches?         
	The IPL is teaching everybody involved something all the time as it is still in its infancy... Players, coaches, administrators, the media, franchise owners... All are learning that it is a game of excitement and skills, with not a lot of guarantee of results. The squads will become much more settled as they play more and more together.         
	Your message to the coaches would be...         
	For coaches, but inclusive of all, I would say be patient and continue to make the IPL the spectacle it is... In fact, make it better.         
	Is too much being made of the first six overs in T20?         
	Look, a definite pattern emerged in the last IPL, where teams which won one or both lots of the first six overs won at the rate of 60 per cent or even better... The first six overs of each innings totals 12 of the 40, or around 30 per cent of the match, which is why they are important. Interestingly, statistics will also show that for teams which posted 160-plus scores, the next four overs were significant almost irrespective of the first six.         
	Finally, just how closely are you going to follow the World T20?         
	I will, for example, look with interest at the Knight Riders man, Ishant (Sharma)... Also look at how teams gel as a national unit... I will, of course, continue to assess the patterns of the game.

                                                   AIFF likely to allow extra foreigner
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) may allow the I-League clubs to recruit one more foreign player as per the three plus one policy formulated by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).         
	The decision is likely to be taken at the AIFF executive committee meeting to be held here on Friday. According to the new rule, a club can recruit four foreigners but one of them has to be from an AFC member country, including Australia.         
	It was also learnt that the AIFF general secretary, Alberto Colaco, may offer to resign on Friday. His resignation will possibly be accepted by the executive committee but he will be asked to continue at least till the Nehru Cup.         
	Apart from discussing the financial implications of the proposed Goal 2011 project, the meeting will also have Mohun Bagans complaint against Bob Houghton for supporting Bhaichung Bhutia on the agenda.         
	Sikkim Football Association, meanwhile, has written a strongly-worded letter to the parent body, a copy of which has also been sent to the IFA, questioning AIFFs inaction in the Bhutia-Bagan imbroglio.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Phelps rebounds with a record
                                                     Phelps rebounds with a record
                  Michael Phelps                     
	Rome: Michael Phelps bounced back from a stunning loss with something more familiar  another world record Wednesday.         
	A night after he was soundly beaten by Germanys Paul Biedermann, Phelps set a world record in the 200-metre butterfly with a time of 1 minute, 51.51 seconds  more than a half-second ahead of his previous mark, 1:52.03.         
	Phelps whipped around quickly to see his time and held up his right index finger when the WR was posted. And just like Beijing, he has taken down another of Mark Spitzs standards, this time with the 34th world record of his career  one better than Spitz during his brilliant run in the pool.         
	There couldnt have been a more appropriate place for Phelps to add another record to his resume. Shortly after he climbed from the pool, Italys Federica Pellegrini sent the home crowd into a frenzy when she set the 20th world mark of the four-day-old meet in the 200 freestyle.         
	It didnt take long for record No.21. South Africas Cameron van der Burgh broke the mark he set in the semis to win the 50 breaststroke, a non-Olympic event. Earlier, Germanys Daniela Samulski and Russias Anastasia Zueva got things rolling by setting records in consecutive semi-final heats in the 50 backstroke, another event not on the Olympic programme.         
	Meanwhile, the two national records he broke have propelled Indias Sandeep Sejwal into the top-100 of the Fina rankings in 50m and 100m breaststroke events. In the 50m breaststroke, Sejwal clocked 27.92, to jump to the 61st in the rankings.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karim not dejected
                                                   Karim not dejected
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa is an optimistic person and that was reflected in the coachs voice when he said that his side, who lost 0-1 to Syrian Club Al-Karama in a group B match of the AFC Cup at Hims, near Damascus, have come back with lots of positives from that outing. The green and maroon brigade returned to the city on Thursday evening.         
	It wasnt an easy match for us at all. We had to undergo a long journey and it is the end of the season for us as well. They had huge support too. In such circumstances, losing 0-1 to a team who played in the final of the AFC Cup a few seasons back, is very encouraging for the team, said the Moroccan while speaking to The Telegraph on Thursday.         
	The attitude of my boys on the whole trip impressed me most. The young bunch behaved like hardcore professionals throughout, knowing exactly what was expected of them. Their determination against a superior side was exemplary. They implemented our pre-match plans excellently, Bencharifa said.         
	He elaborated: We played very well in the match. In fact, for the first hour or so we dominated the game. It was only later, when Al-Karama changed their style of play, using more ground passes, that we faced some problems. But still the boys did well.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Muniyappa holds nerve on final day
                                                   Muniyappa holds nerve on final day
                            
	Gurgaon: India found its newest Asian Tour title winner in Chinaswamy Muniyappa, who held his nerve and survived a playoff to bag the Indian Open golf tournament here Sunday.         
	The DLF Golf and Country Club stood witness to the rise of a new Indian golfing star as Muniyappa never allowed the lead to slip through his fingers since he had soared to the top after the second round. The Asian Tour rookie signed off with a modest two-under 70 and went on to blunt Korean Lee Sungs ambition in the playoff.         
	Playing his rookie season on the Asian Tour, Muniyappa sank his birdie putt on the par-five 18th hole to claim an emphatic play-off victory on home soil at the $1.25 million tournament.         
	Both Muniyappa and Lee ended the tournament on 12-under 276 in regulation play before they headed back to the 18th hole for the play-off.         
	Going into the Indian Open, my aim was to improve my ranking and retain the Asian Tour card. Winning the title is an amazing feeling, said Muniyappa, a caddie-turned-golfer, who plans on buying a house with the $198,125 he won. This was definitely the biggest paycheck of his career.         
	Muniyappa was ranked No. 97 on the Asian Tour heading into the Indian Open. The pressure had eased considerably when we went into the playoff, for I knew my tour card was safe, said the golfer from Bangalore who turned professional in 1996 but is playing his first year on the Asian Tour.         
	I learned the game by watching members at the club. My first clubs were a seven iron and a two iron. I have never had a coach. I got some advice on things to work on this year on my swing but it would have taken a lot of practising. There is no time. Id rather be playing in tournaments than practising, he added .         
	Fellow Bangalorean Anirban Lahiri brought in the best card of the day, a sparkling eight-under 64, to zoom to tied third at 10-under 278.         
	Finishing just one stoke behind at tied sixth were the Indian duo of Digvijay Singh and Ashok Kumar at 280, while Harendra Gupta (282) notched up a tied eighth place finish.         
	Among others, rising Indian Gaganjeet Bhullar (284) finished tied 16th, while Arjun Atwals (288) worst card of the week, an error-strewn 77, had the Orlando-based Indian tied 33rd, one shot ahead of SSP Chowrasia who came tied 36th.         
	Indian-born Swede Daniel Chopra (286) finished tied 21st, while former US Open champion Michael Campbell (305) came tied 70th. (PTI)

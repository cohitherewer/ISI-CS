                                                   A real test for us: Vettori
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hamilton: New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori on Tuesday said his team will have to put up an aggressive performance to avoid being blown off the park by the rampaging Indians in the Test series.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	If there was enough gap between the ODIs and the Tests         
	Probably in this day and age, three days normally gets the guys into a relatively good space for the Test match Also the changing of faces makes it a bit different and also the white kits. I think guys get their heads around pretty quickly. If you want to be a good player in this day and age, you have to.         
	The Indian side         
	Probably the experience is the major factor if you look at the Indian top-order. It is very impressive through their weight of games and weight of runs. We know we are up against it but we always fancy ourselves in our own conditions. Its going to be a real test for us and we are going to need a lot of guys within our team, not just one or two, stepping up to give ourselves a chance.         
	On what is needed to make an impact against the Indians         
	You have got to take them on. The war of attrition probably wont work. I think we have got to be aggressive but in saying that, we have got to be disciplined. Those are the things we didnt quite get right in the one-day series.         
	The pitch         
	It looks alright, I think it will be pretty flat. Maybe win the toss and bat first, but we just have to wait and see how it shapes up. There is a little bit of live grass on it, but generally, it is a pretty good deck here.         
	The Indians not so encouraging result here         
	It helps. We can take some confidence into this series knowing that India havent done that well. But they probably have brought out as good a team as this in the past. We have to play very very well to beat these guys, regardless of their history here.         
	The Chris Martin controversy         
	I am always a big fan of Chris, I think he has done a fair job for the New Zealand side for a long time and the selectors know that as well. We just want to make sure he is back to his best.         
	The New Zealand bowling         
	The bowlers are going to come under pressure from the Indian line-up just like the Indian bowlers will come under pressure if the wicket is good because you can get sorted out so easily against this line-up. If you are slightly off your game, then they can really hurt you.

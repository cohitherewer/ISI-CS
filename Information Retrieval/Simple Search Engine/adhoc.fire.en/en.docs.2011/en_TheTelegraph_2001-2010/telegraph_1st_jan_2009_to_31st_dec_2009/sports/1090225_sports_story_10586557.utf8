The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis steers Pakistan to safety
                                                   Younis steers Pakistan to safety
                                  
	Karachi: Younis Khan posted an unbeaten 306 to steer Pakistan to 574 for five in reply to Sri Lankas 644/7 declared as the first cricket Test meandered to a draw with only a day remaining.         
	Captain Khan, only the 20th batsman and third Pakistani to surpass 300 runs in a Test innings, guided the hosts past the follow-on target and within 70 runs of Sri Lankas first innings total by stumps Tuesday on a lifeless wicket at National Stadium.         
	His patient innings over 12 hours and 11 minutes featured 27 fours and four sixes from 545 balls and a superb range of strokes on both sides of the wicket. I dedicate this innings to my family, my friends and my teammates who have always supported me, Khan said. The team needed an innings like that from someone and I was lucky I did it for my team.         
	It was the first time in Test crickets 132-year history that both captains have scored more than 200 in the same Test match.         
	Mahela Jayawardene, who will step down from the Sri Lanka captaincy after the second Test at Lahore next month, made 240 and shared in a world record fourth-wicket stand in the first innings.         
	Khan raised his triple century in the last session Tuesday when he played a reverse sweep off star spinner Muttiah Muralidharan and ran for three runs.         
	Khan is now aiming for Pakistans Test-best of 337 made by Hanif Mohammed against the West Indies at Barbados in 1958. Inzamam-ul-Haq is the only other Pakistani triple century-maker. He scored 329 against New Zealand at Lahore in 2002.         
	Khan featured in two century stands after Pakistan resumed their first innings at the overnight total of 296/3 and still needed 149 runs to avoid follow on. He put on 174 runs with Faisal Iqbal (57), nephew of former captain Javed Miandad, after adding 130 for the fourth wicket with Misbah-ul-Haq (42).         
	Khan, who came out to bat late on the second day in his 59th Test, frustrated the Sri Lanka bowlers on a flat wicket which has come under severe criticism with bowlers struggling to get any assistance.

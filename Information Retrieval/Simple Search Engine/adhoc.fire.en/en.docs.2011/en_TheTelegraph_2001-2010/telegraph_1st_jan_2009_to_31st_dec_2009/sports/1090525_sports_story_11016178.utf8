The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Part-timers to play crucial role in World T20: Dhoni
                                                     Part-timers to play crucial role in World T20: Dhoni
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Dhoni                           
	Johannesburg: Mahendra Singh Dhoni didnt look that disappointed on Saturday after the Chennai Super Kings failed to make it to the IPL final. He said that with the bowling attack at his disposal he couldnt have done better. He seemed to have turned the focus to Team Indias chances in the World Twenty20.               
	The following are excerpts from the press conference         
	On the bottom placed teams of last year making it to the final this time         
	Thankfully, the teams in the middle stayed in the middle. Twenty20 is such a format where you have to do well everyday Especially when you are at the knockout stage. Those three-and-a-half hours are all that matters. If you look at the two teams that have made it to the final, their players have performed consistently. In the Bangalore Royal Challengers, theres no one person doing all the work everyones contributing. Its not that they have the best bowling side. But everyone puts in two or three very good overs. Their spinners have also been doing well. I think both the teams deserve to be in the final. They have played better cricket. Hopefully we will get an exciting final.         
	The positives for the Chennai Super Kings from this edition         
	Well everyone says its a batsmans game, but bowlers are important. They definitely contribute in the teams win. Our bowling department was always fragile from the very start and injuries never helped. (Sudeep) Tyagi missed out because of injury, Albie Morkel had an injury and today (MS) Gony also suffered an injury. Overall, I am happy with the performance of the side. We need to field better. We are a better fielding side than whatever we have done in this tournament. Yes I am disappointed for not making it to the final but we got beaten by a side that played better cricket on that particular day.         
	The gains from the IPL going into the ICC World T20         
	The one thing that has emerged in this years IPL and will really help us in the T20 World Cup is the way the part-timers have bowled. That experience will really count. Also, the 50-odd games of this tournament were mostly close finishes. So all the Indian players, who were part of the winning side or maybe the bowlers who were part of the winning moment, will really handle the pressure well when it comes to an international T20 match.         
	So, loads of positives have come out of the tournament. Last years IPL definitely helped India play better in the T20 and one-day formats. So hopefully this years tournament too will take us to the next level.

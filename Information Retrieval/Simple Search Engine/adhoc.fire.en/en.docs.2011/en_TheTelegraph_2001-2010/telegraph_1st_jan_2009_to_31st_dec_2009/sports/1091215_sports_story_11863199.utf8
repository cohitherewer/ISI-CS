The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We need to improve our bowling at death: Dhoni 
                                                                                                                       7                                      We need to improve our bowling at death: Dhoni 
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Rajkot: The fielding and bowling remain the focus as Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. begin their campaign in the five-match one-day series on Tuesday. We need to get our basics right, stressed the Team India captain at a press conference on Monday.               
	The following are excerpts               
	The team goal         
	We want to win the series. Thats what we are supposed to do. At the same time, not being overconfident is also important. We have to be in that phase of mind where you are very confident, but at the same time, must not cross that line. So we are taking care of the things we need to do, including fielding and death bowling. The conditions would suit them as the wickets are good for batting. We have quite a few areas to work on and are focusing on that.         
	Yuvraj Singhs finger injury         
	Hes been injected... We will see how exactly he feels before the game tomorrow (Tuesday), and accordingly take a decision. Hes very much a part of the side If Yuvi is not playing, theres a very good chance that Virat Kohli will play.         
	The teams poor fielding         
	Its a bit of a concern. Its been there for quite sometime now. We are hoping it does not come into play in the one-day series. There are a few youngsters who have come into the side. The responsibility will be on them to show off how good they are as a fielder Once you have at least four good fielders, you can stop the batsmen from getting those singles. That really helps in not giving easy singles         
	Mike Youngs impact         
	Since Mike has joined us we are laying emphasis on fielding as well. He also needs a few specific sessions as fielding coach, and its a very important aspect of any format of the game. If you can see the impact in three days, that will be great!         
	On how long it would take to feel the difference         
	Its something you need to do over a period of time. Need to get your basics right Fielding is also an area where if you are not in a good position (to field the ball), there are very good chances you can injure yourself. If you get your basics right, there are very good chances you will field well. The injury list will also go down at the same time. It will take some time but will start to reflect soon.         
	The bowling in the death overs         
	We need to improve our death bowling. Variation is important, and at the same time, you have to bowl good yorkers. Thats the key.         
	The return of Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan after the T20s         
	They are the most experienced bowlers we have got. Its very important to get early breakthroughs with the new ball and at the same time put pressure during the middle-overs (from 15th or 20th to 40 th).         
	The wicket         
	It has always been a good track to bat on. Whenever we have played here its good for the batsmen The ball comes on nicely on to the bat The spinners have to rely more on variations in pace and line and length. I dont think they will get too much of a turn. But thats only a prediction. You may see a different wicket tomorrow. Thats what we are assuming.         
	Whether he would prefer to bat or bowl         
	Its an early start. This time of the year, its generally cool in the morning. The first half an hour or 45 minutes will be the best time for the fast bowlers. Initially, they will get some help and movement. Here the wickets are generally hard and good. It generally improves for the batsmen later. The pace remains the same. It all depends on your strength and youve to decide accordingly on whether to bat first or field.         
	If Sanath Jayasuriya is more dangerous in the middle overs         
	Whenever hes played a long innings and batted through that period  the middle overs  he emphasises more on running between the wickets. Hes a very good runner and tries to put pressure on the fielders. The key is not to give him easy singles.         
	Muttiah Muralidharans form         
	Its not about what has happened in the series. Hes still a great bowler and can have an impact on the game at any time during the series It has nothing to do with what has happened till now.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Thrilling win for Bremen 
                                                   Thrilling win for Bremen 
                      
	Frankfurt: Werder Bremen and Shakhtar Donetsk both reached their first Uefa Cup final with narrow victories on Thursday. Werder rallied to beat Hamburger SV 3-2 in the second leg of their all-German final Thursday and went through on the away goals rule, with the aggregate score 3-3 after Hamburgs 1-0 win in Bremen one week ago.         
	Shakhtar edged Dynamo Kiev 2-1 in the second leg of their all-Ukrainian matchup to advance 3-2 on aggregate. Brazilian midfielder Ilsinho scored the winner late in the game.         
	The final is May 20 in Istanbul and both Werder and Shakhtar made the title game for the first time.         
	In a fast-paced game in Hamburg, Ivica Olic scored for the home team in the 13th minute, but Diego tied the game in the 29th. Claudio Pizarro scored in the 66th for a 2-1 Werder lead, Frank Baumann made it 3-1 in the 83rd, before Olic scored his second in the 87th to send the game into a thrilling finish.         
	Werder held off Hamburgs desperate late attempts to make their second final of the season. Werder also eliminated Hamburg in the semi-finals of the German Cup.         
	I think I have to congratulate both teams for a very good game, Werder coach Thomas Schaaf said. But I think my team deserved to advance, we were able to come back, we had confidence and we pushed forward.         
	In the final, Werder will be without playmaker Diego and striker Hugo Almeida, who both picked up yellow cards that rule them out. (AP)

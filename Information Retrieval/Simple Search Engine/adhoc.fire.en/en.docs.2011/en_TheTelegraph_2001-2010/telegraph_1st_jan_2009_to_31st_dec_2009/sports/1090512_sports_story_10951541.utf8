The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Twenty20 is not about skills: Imran
                                                   Twenty20 is not about skills: Imran
                      
	Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan does not watch Twenty20 cricket and believes anyone can win the forthcoming ICC T20 World Cup in England.         
	I dont watch Twenty20 cricket because it is just Toolah (chance) cricket. It is not about skills or talent. That is why I think any team can win the World Cup, Imran told reporters. The T20 World Cup will begin next month in England.         
	The former cricketer who is now an active politician and heads his Tehreek-e-Insaaf party said that India may have a role in the isolation of Pakistan in international cricket.         
	Look, after the Mumbai terror attacks I have heard that India also did not want Sri Lanka to tour Pakistan. So you cant rule out this possibility, Imran said when asked if he agreed that the Indians were trying to isolate Pakistan in world cricket.         
	He also blamed the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) officials for not doing enough homework while going to the International Cricket Council meeting at which the members decided to move the 2011 World Cup matches from Pakistan because of security reasons.

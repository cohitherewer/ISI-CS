                                                     Odafe: I want this I-League
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Odafe Okolie                           
	New Delhi : Nigerian striker Odafe Okolie on Sunday became the highest scorer in a single edition of the I-League when he struck two goals in Churchill Brothers 3-1 victory over East Bengal at Margao.         
	The prolific scorer has now swelled his tally of goals to 24 to surpass his own record of 22 goals set last season.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph after the match, Odafe said winning a match had always given him more pleasure than scoring goals. I never thought about becoming the top scorer at the start of the season, said Odafe. Winning the title had always been my only priority. Last time, I scored 22 goals, yet my team finished runners-up. I am ready to give away all my goals if someone can ensure the title for my club, said the Nigerian.         
	Odafe is on the threshold of achieving his dream as Churchill, with 42 points from 20 matches, are firm favouries to bag their maiden title. Though hotly chased by Sporting Clube de Goa and Mohun Bagan for the top slot, Churchill are not expected to falter against lowly Air India and Mohammedan Sporting in their last two matches.         
	Odafe said he enjoyed all his 24 goals but the best came against Mahindra United at Margao. It was my best. It was his second goal against Mahindra and was struck from outside the box.         
	The Nigerian is also on the verge of creating another recordthe first player to emerge top scorer for the third consecutive time.         
	In the 2006-07 season, Odafe was the joint top scorer along with Ranty Martins of Dempo with 16 goals. Next season, he looked ever more dangerous as he struck 22 goals to beat the previous mark set by Dudu (21 goals) for Sporting Clube de Goa in the 2004-05 season. I have never counted my goals. I respect all the defenders in India. That I score goals is Gods blessings, Odafe said.         
	Asked whether he would like to don the jersey of the Indian national team, Odafe laughed and said: I dont mind playing for India. I havent played for Nigeria, so under the Fifa rule I am eligible to apply to play for another country. But no one has approached me so far.

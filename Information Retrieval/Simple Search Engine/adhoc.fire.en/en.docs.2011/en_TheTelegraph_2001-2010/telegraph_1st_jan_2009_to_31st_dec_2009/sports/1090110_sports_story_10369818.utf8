                                                   Astroturf must for Beighton, feel captains
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Punjab Police captain Kanwalpreet Singh feels that the Beighton Cup will hardly help in development of the game in the country.         
	Talking to The Telegraph after the final against Punjab Sind Bank, Kanwalpreet said that Beighton should be upgraded keeping in mind the international standards.         
	Its always great to play in such a prestigious tournament like the Beighton. I always feel honoured But you know the organisers should upgrade it.         
	While the whole world is playing on astroturf they are still organising it on grass This will hardly help players, Kanwalpreet said.         
	You know people should follow to improve the game I know that there are some emotions involved with this tournament But we should keep pace with time That will only help one to improve the standards, he said.         
	Punjab amp; Sind Bank captain Mandeep Singh also shared his sentiments.

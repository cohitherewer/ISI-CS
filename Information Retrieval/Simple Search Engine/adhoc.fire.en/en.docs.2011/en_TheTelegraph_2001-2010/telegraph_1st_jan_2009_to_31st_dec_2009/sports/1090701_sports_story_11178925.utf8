The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hope John doesnt wear the rival jumper, says Ponting
                                                     Hope John doesnt wear the rival jumper, says Ponting
                  Ricky Ponting                     
	London: Australia skipper Ricky Ponting feels uneasy on seeing John Buchanan in the rival camp prior to the Ashes and is hoping that the former Aussie coach does not sport an England jumper.         
	Buchanan has been appointed as a short-term consultant to England in the run-up to the Ashes and would be overseeing the Lions when they take on Australia in a four-day match starting on in Worcester.         
	I just hope I dont see him with an England jumper on. That will be disappointing, Ponting told a Australian newspaper.         
	Buchanan was Australia coach when they hammered England 5-0 in the Ashes. Ponting, however, ruled out Buchanans England job having any impact on Australian players.         
	I havent thought about it and I havent heard it spoken about around the group at all, Ponting said about Buchanan, who was sacked by the Kolkata Knight Riders recently. Im not exactly sure what his overall role is with the ECB. Its only a week or two from what I understand.         
	The Australia captain said just like the IPL is throwing up situations where players from the same country battle against one another, cricketers coming up against former coaches was also becoming a reality.         
	Theres been a lot of talk about players with this IPL stuff happening, but its going to happen with coaches too, going from one team to the next, he said.         
	Suspicious of an England design in choosing Cardiff for first Test, Australia are sending a spy to the virgin venue to check on the state of pitch there.         
	Ponting believes Cardiff, which has never hosted a Test, has been deliberately chosen ahead of traditional grounds like Old Trafford and Trent Bridge because England want maximum advantage out of the dry pitch knowing that Australia lack a front-line spinner.         
	Historically, Cardiff has been one wicket around the country that has spun (in county cricket). Its been one of the driest wickets in England. Theyve probably got a bigger advantage there than anywhere else in the country.         
	They know that we havent got (Shane) Warne any more. They know that spin side of Australian cricket at the moment is probably not what it used to be, Ponting said.         
	Weve been talking about trying to send someone down to Cardiff this week so we can have a look at what the wicket preparation looks like. That way we can get it into our own minds a little bit earlier as to what to expect, he said.         
	Australias confusion has been compounded by the contradictory reports about how the new strip will play in the first Test.         
	Since weve been here weve heard lots of stories about how dry its going to be and how much its going to spin. There was even talk a month ago about the Test not going ahead there because of problems with the pitch, Ponting said.         
	Pontings concerns were magnified after he spoke to umpire George Sharp, who officiated in Australias opening tour match in Hove and also umpired an early season one-day county match between Essex and Glamorgan in Cardiff on May 12.         
	In that county match, Pakistani leg-spinner Danish Kaneria claimed 4-16 from 10 overs for Essex to rout home team Glamorgan.         
	George Sharp said that Kaneria was unplayable. He was turning them square, Ponting said.         
	So concerned was the England and Wales Cricket Board about the state of the pitch that a disciplinary committee penalised Glamorgan for the state of the wicket.         
	However, the countys cricket manager, Matthew Maynard, said it was an aberration, with the new groundsmen letting the pitch dry out too quickly.         
	Meanwhile, Buchanan has revealed that he has shared with England coach Andy Flower some of the secrets of his long association with Pontings men which could be used to the home teams advantage in the Ashes, which begins July 8.         
	We also talked about Englands trip to Belgium, which was something I took a fair bit of interest in. It was good to catch up with him briefly, and was just one of quite a few things I am looking to accomplish on this trip, Buchanan told a website.

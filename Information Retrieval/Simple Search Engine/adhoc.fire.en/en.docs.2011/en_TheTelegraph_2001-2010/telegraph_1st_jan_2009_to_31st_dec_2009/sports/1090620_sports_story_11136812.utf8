                                                                                                                                                           Sehwag may miss Trophy
    Calcutta: Virender Sehwag may miss the Champions Trophy, beginning September 24, as he would be out of action for 12-16 weeks following a surgery on his shoulder.
  Sehwag, who was ruled out of the World Twenty20 without playing a single match, went under the knife on June 11. He will be under the observation of India physio Nitin Patel during his rehabilitation stint at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore, according to a website.
    Sehwag rsquo;s shoulder will be evaluated after 10 weeks to check whether he can throw a ball.
    Ratnakar Shetty, chief administrative officer of the BCCI, however, declined comment on Sehwag rsquo;s availability. 
    MCC view
    Melbourne: The custodians of cricket laws, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), feels that the advent of Twenty20 may put the 50-over format, and not the five-day game, in danger. The MCC said Test cricket has enough takers to coexist with Twenty20 but feels some innovations are indeed required to keep the spectators interested in the ODI format. 
  ldquo;There are enough seats at the table for Test cricket to coexist with Twenty20. I think it is the one-day format that is in danger, and if something is not done to revamp the 50-over game, we could see that either become less attractive or perhaps even die, rdquo; he added.
    Punter warning
    London: Ricky Ponting has warned England that he is determined to erase the bitter memories of his last Ashes tour by leading Australia to victory over the old rivals. ldquo;There rsquo;s one thing on my cricketing resume that hasn rsquo;t been achieved yet, and that rsquo;s being captain of a winning Ashes series in England, rdquo; Ponting said. ldquo;It rsquo;s something very dear to my heart, and something I rsquo;ll certainly be speaking to the players about making sure we get over that hurdle. rdquo;
    Bond is back
    Wellington: Former New Zealand fast bowler Shane Bond has made himself available for international selection again after cutting ties with the unsanctioned Indian Cricket League (ICL). The 34-year-old said on Friday that he would be available for all three forms of international cricket including Tests, which he blamed for many of the injuries that blighted his 17-Test and 67 one-day Internationals career. 
    Hodge support
    Melbourne: After Steve Waugh, Brett Lee and Adam Gilchrist, it was the turn of Brad Hodge to express solidarity with Indian students following racist attacks in Australia. Hodge took part in a street cricket match between Victoria Police and the students, aimed at fostering peace and harmony, on Friday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sutil: Spa is our circuit
                                                   Sutil: Spa is our circuit
                      
	Silverstone: Force India driver Adrian Sutil, brimming with confidence after his top 10 finish in Valencia, expects the new updates to bridge the gap that separates his team from their maiden Formula One points in Sundays Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps.         
	After the upgrades debuted in the European Grand Prix, both the VJM02 cars finished inside top 12 and Sutil revealed it has indeed made a difference.         
	It was a very simple track, it just goes straight on, so you dont need a lot of down-force. But I think we gained about half a second, and it should be even more in Spa, Sutil said.         
	Describing Spa as one of his favourite tracks, the German said Force India might break its point duck there.         
	Spa I think is our circuit. We were quite good there last year, and this year must be much, much better. Ill be happy with a dry weekend. The circuit is amazing in the dry, and our car is now good in the dry. I want to see how our update works, Sutil said.

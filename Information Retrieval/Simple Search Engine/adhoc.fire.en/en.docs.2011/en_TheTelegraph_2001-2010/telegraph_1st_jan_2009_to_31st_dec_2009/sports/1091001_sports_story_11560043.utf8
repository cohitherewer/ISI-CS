	Milan: Renaults Fernando Alonso will replace Kimi Raikkonen at Ferrari next season, the Italian team said Wednesday, ending months of speculation surrounding the move.         
	Spains Alonso, world champion in 2005 and 2006, has signed a three-year deal and will partner Felipe Massa next year. No financial details were announced.         
	We are very pleased to welcome to our team a winning driver, who has demonstrated his extraordinary worth by already claiming two world titles in his career, Ferrari team boss Stefano Domenicali said in a statement.         
	Fernando has an exceptional personality and we will do everything to give him and Felipe a competitive car. We are certain these two drivers will form the best possible double-act for a team like ours. Having said that, we want to thank Kimi for what he has done with Ferrari.         
	Finn Raikkonen, who won the 2007 world championship in his first season with the Italians, has been linked in the media with a return to McLaren or championship leaders Brawn. We have jointly decided to end my deal with Ferrari a year early, Raikkonen said ahead of Sundays Japanese GP.         
	Brazilian Massa who had fracturing his skull at Julys Hungarian GP, has already started karting and is expected to be fit for the next season.         
	Italys Giancarlo Fisichella, filling in for Massa this season, will be Ferraris reserve driver next year.           (REUTERS)

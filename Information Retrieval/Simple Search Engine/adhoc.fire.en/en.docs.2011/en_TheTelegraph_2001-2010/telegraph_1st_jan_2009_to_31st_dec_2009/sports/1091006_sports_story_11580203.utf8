                                                   Selection panel on CAB agenda
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former Bengal batsman Jaideep Mukherjee and wicket-keeper Mintu Das are likely to be included in the senior selection committee. It is learnt that ex-Ranji players Moloy Banerjee and Arindam Sarkar are also in the running for a place on the committee.         
	The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) will finalise the Bengal senior selection committee along with the junior and womens committees at a working committee meeting Tuesday.         
	Jaideep is kept busy by his role in the Kolkata Knight Riders support staff. So there is a question mark over his availability because were he to get into the selection committee hed need to travel a lot, a source told The Telegraph.         
	Sambaran Banerjee and Devang Gandhi will remain as the other two selectors in the committee.

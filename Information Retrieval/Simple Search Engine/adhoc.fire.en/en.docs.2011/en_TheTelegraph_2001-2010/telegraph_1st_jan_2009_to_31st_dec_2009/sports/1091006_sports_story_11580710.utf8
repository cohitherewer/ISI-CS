The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Taliban leave Flintoff shaken
                                                     Taliban leave Flintoff shaken
            Ben Leach            Andrew Flintoff                           
	Freddie Flintoff and Gary Lineker were caught up in a Taliban attack as they visited troops in Afghanistan.         
	The England cricketer and BBC presenter had to scramble for cover under tables in an Armed Forces dining room after an alarm warned of incoming rocket fire. The all-clear was given thirty seconds later.         
	Flintoff, 31, said after the drama at Kandahar airbase: I thought it was a wind-up but then I saw everyone dive to the floor. It was scary.         
	He told an English daily: Ive have seen things over the past few days that will live with me for ever. You see news reports, but when you see it first hand you realise what a great job theyre doing.         
	Its been humbling and has put my life into perspective. I play cricket for my country  but then you come here and meet people of 18 fighting for their country.         
	Lineker, 48, was hit by a second scare when his military jet lost an engine before landing safely. He said: Hearing that alarm really brought home whats going on. You take your hat off to these guys here. I expected it to be tough but didnt expect the environment Ive discovered.         
	The other thing that strikes you is the age of some of them on the front line. Ive a son whos just turned 18 and the fact there are kids out there the same age as him really makes you think.         
	Flintoff and Lineker were in the country to hand out a Pride of Britain award given by an English daily.         
	Not quite the soldier at the frontier but Flintoff definitely knows what is it like to fight for ones country. After all, the Lancashire all-rounder fought through the pain barrier to play in his last Test series for his country and his contribution in England regaining the Ashes cannot be overstated.         
	Since the famous, and historic, Ashes summer Flintoff, who for all practical purposes has become a freelance cricketer, has had his loyalty to the country questioned. That the burly blue-eyed boy has shifted base to Dubai in the meantime too hasnt helped.         
	But Flintoff remains unfazed and has said that he is always available should England need him, in one-dayers and Twenty20 of course.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chargers take on Kings XI
                                                   Chargers take on Kings XI
                      
	Kimberley: Fresh from their 19-run victory over the Mumbai Indians, a rejuvenated Deccan Chargers would look to continue their momentum when they cross swords with the Kings XI Punjab in their Indian Premier League (IPL) match here on Saturday.         
	The Hyderabad side, who began their campaign with four wins on the trot, snapped their three-match losing streak and would look to improve their position in the points table with a win against an inconsistent Punjab side.         
	In the batting department, the Chargers captain Adam Gilchrist and South African Herschelle Gibbs have been in good nick at the top of the order while Rohit Sharma and T. Suman have been the middle order mainstays. The Chargers will also be strengthened by the return of Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds who has been cleared by his board to play for the IPL.         
	In contrast, the Yuvraj Singh-led Kings XI Punjab have managed just four wins in the tournament so far.         
	The news of Australian paceman Brett Lees availability will surely bring smile on Yuvrajs face and at the same time also add some extra sting to their bowling attack, which otherwise lacks penetration.         
	The Punjab sides South African fast bowler Yusuf Abdullas pace and deceiving swing have surely made the life of the batsmen difficult, but lack of appropriate support form the other bowlers have been a major problem for the team. Lee is expected to share the new ball with Irfan Pathan while the side will expect Abdulla, who has taken 14 wickets from nine outings so far, to keep up his good job.         
	In-form Yuvraj is their batting mainstay with Sri Lankan imports Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara giving good support down the order.         
	The Kings XI team management may think of promoting Sangakkara as an opener to bat with Australian Simon Katich, keeping in mind the Deccan Chargers new-ball attack of Australian Ryan Harris and RP Singh.         
	RP has taken 15 wickets from five matches so far           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies wrap it up in 21 balls
                                                                                                                       7                                      Aussies wrap it up in 21 balls
                      
	Perth: Australia needed 21 balls on the last day, Sunday, to win the final Test and retain the Frank Worrell Trophy with a 2-0 victory over the West Indies.         
	The end came when Kemar Roach was ruled caught behind via an umpiring review, according to Cricinfo.         
	Roach and Gavin Tonge had added 15 when Doug Bollinger and the Australians were certain Roach had got an edge to Brad Haddin.         
	The batsman called for a review: there was a noise but no replay showed a clear nick and there was nothing on Hot Spot.         
	Umpire Billy Bowden finally raised his finger for a second time following consultation with Asad Rauf.         
	He smashed it, Bollinger said. He hit it, he was out.         
	The left-arm pacer finished with figures of three for 71 in the second innings, and eight wickets in the game.         
	Roach and Tonge started the last day, chasing 51 to reach the victory target of 359.         
	Roach played and missed a couple of times in Shane Watsons first over, before Bollinger went for five runs against the aggressive Tonge.         
	Then Tonge inside edged Watson for four and drove over mid-off for two before Roach sliced a four over gully.         
	The reason West Indies still had an outside chance on the final morning was due to the 128-run partnership between Narsingh Deonarine (82) and Brendan Nash (65). But their hopes diminished when they lost six wickets in the final session.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Debutant Trotts century adds to Aussie misery
                                                   Debutant Trotts century adds to Aussie misery
            THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH                      
	London: This Ashes series has not been so dramatic as the one in 2005 because fewer great players have been involved and the overall standard has been lower. But it will be an even finer achievement if England finish off Australia and regain the Ashes 2-1, because England have been almost completely out-played in two of the five Tests and shown the utmost resilience.         
	England have also been helped by an error of selection that will go down as one of the alltime howlers: Australias omission of Nathan Hauritz in favour of Stuart Clark. This Oval pitch is not a minefield, but it has spun from the start like no other here in the last generation, and the Australians were found naked.         
	So, with the wrong attack for the conditions, Australia were powerless to prevent England setting a target of 546 in 21 overs and two days. Jonathan Trott became only the third England player in the last century to score an Ashes hundred on his Test debut, a triumph of temperament which set up a target way beyond anything achieved in Test.         
	Yet so unsuited was Australias attack to the conditions  the pitch has lost not only its top surface but pace for the quick bowlers  that while Trott scored 119 off 193 balls, Andrew Flintoff, in his final Test innings, Stuart Broad, his anointed heir, Graeme Swann and James Anderson so appreciated Australias lack of a specialist spinner that they smacked 129 runs off 137 balls while partnering Trott.         
	Trotts most important input came in his first innings of 41, which helped to disguise another under-performance by Englands specialist batsmen apart from Strauss, and in bailing out Englands second innings with his captain. A strong will and bottom hand saw Trott and England through to the sunny uplands where they could frolic in the late-summer sunshine before declaring.         
	Like most great leaders, Strauss has been lucky  except for the most savage blow of losing Kevin Pietersen after Lords, for which Trott has made belated amends. Strauss has won the toss four times, which conferred the great blessing of batting first in the London Tests.         
	Strauss batted almost throughout the morning session and, as he had done at Lords and on the first morning here, emboldened his team and demoralised Australia. He and Trott pushed ahead slowly for the first hour, by the end of which the Australians knew they were stuffed, and Ponting was fated to become the first of their captains ever to lose two Ashes series in England: an insult to add to the injury when Matthew Priors shot hit the finest silly point there has been  among Pontings many other accomplishments  in the mouth.         
	After the hard work by Englands fourth wicket pair in their stand of 118 came the joy-ride. England were so far ahead that the run-out of Matt Prior  another direct hit by Katich  did not signify, and Flintoff could enjoy his last Test innings of 22 from 18 balls.         
	Any lingering remnants of an Australian aura were demolished by Graeme Swann with 63 off 55 balls at his whimsical best. With reverse-pulls he took the micky out of North for feigning to be his counterpart then, when Ponting forgot that the ball would only come on to the bat when new, hit skimming drives and cheeky pulls.         
	Australia too found that the best time for batting was against the new ball. Katich batted almost as well as he had fielded, if that is possible. Shane Watson could have been run out early on by Ian Bell who had a near-miss from extra-cover to add to his chronicle of near-misses.         
	It was only when Broad came on that a pace bowler found movement off the pitch. As a young dog he has learned the trick of bowling cutters, which his seniors cannot do. And even if the pitch has slowed down for the quick bowlers, Swanns offbreaks are still gripping and leaping from this deliberately parched pitch.         
	If, or when, Australia lose this game, they will plummet down the ICCs world Test rankings. A spinner will be one place to start. Work on scoring first innings totals is another area. Also, Australias out-cricket has been below their usual standards: they have conceded 261 extras in this series of small margins, almost twice as many as England have conceded. It is only a matter of time, and fine weather.

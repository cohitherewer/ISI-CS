The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Inzy roots for Afridi as T20 captain
                                                   Inzy roots for Afridi as T20 captain
                      
	Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq believes flamboyant all-rounder Shahid Afridi should succeed Younus Khan as Pakistans next Twenty20 captain.         
	Younus announced his retirement from Twenty20 cricket after leading the country to the World Cup last month in England and Inzamam felt Afridi would be the right replacement.         
	I would back Afridi because he has performed outstandingly in the World Cup and he enjoys this form of the game. Plus, he has proven himself leading the Karachi and Sindh teams in domestic cricket also, Inzamam said.         
	It was very important that whoever led Pakistan was a good performer himself and led by example.         
	Dont forget that we are just nine months to prepare for the defence of our title in the World Cup in the West Indies next year, Inzamam added. Afridi has said he is not running after the captaincy but if he got the chance it would be a big honour for him to lead the country.         
	On Younus decision to quit Twenty20, Inzamam said his decision must be respected.         
	I would not say whether he took the right decision or not. But the fact is it is his decision and it must be respected, Inzamam said.

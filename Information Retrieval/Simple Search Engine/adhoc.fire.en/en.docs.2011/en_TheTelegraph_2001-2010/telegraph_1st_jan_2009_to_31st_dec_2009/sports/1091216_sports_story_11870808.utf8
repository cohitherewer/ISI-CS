	London: Richard Branson launched his Virgin Racing Formula One team on Tuesday with a plan to make money where others have burned through billions.         
	We havent put a lot of money in, weve put our brand in, the Briton told reporters after the team presented Brazilian rookie Lucas di Grassi and Germanys Timo Glock as their driver line-up.         
	On the back of the brand, the team are managing to get a lot of sponsors. Our involvement is the naming of the team and some money.         
	The team first secured their place on the 2010 grid as Manor Grand Prix when slots were made available to new entrants earlier in the year. Bransons Virgin Group sponsored champions Brawn this year.         
	Virgin, billed as a new team for a new era, will have a car designed by former Simtek owner Nick Wirth using only computational fluid dynamics rather than wind tunnel testing.         
	Manor founder John Booth will be the sporting director while Alex Tai, formerly director of special projects for the Virgin Group, will be team principal.         
	Etienne de Villiers, the former president of the mens ATP tour, will be non-executive chairman.         
	Tai said cost-cutting measures and budget caps had changed the Formula One landscape.         
	It is possible to have a F1 team that actually makes money, he said. With this limiting to the budgets, we find ourselves on a level playing field. That is the opportunity for us to actually have a profitable F1 team.         
	Virgin have lined up 10 sponsors for 2010 and Tai said they were fully-funded for the season ahead.         
	Meanwhile, Branson challenged aviation rival Tony Fernandes, who is backing Lotus F1, to a Formula One duel on Tuesday with the loser having to dress up as an airline stewardess.

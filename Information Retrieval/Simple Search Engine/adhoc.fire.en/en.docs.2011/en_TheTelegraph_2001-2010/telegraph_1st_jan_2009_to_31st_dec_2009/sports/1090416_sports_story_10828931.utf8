                                                   Churchills enviable N factor
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Margao: There is an N factor that has been the key to Churchill Brothers impressive form this season  their three Nigeria imports, forwards Okolie Odafe and Felix Chimaokwu and defender Ogba Kalu Nnanna, have played a stellar role that has put the team on the threshold of victory in the I-League.         
	I am happy for Odafe. His previous coaches told me that he did not have discipline, he did not train and all sorts of things. But he has answered them all by scoring 24 goals, coach Zoran Djordjevic said.         
	His overall tally this season so far is 47, and I want him to score three more against Mohammedan Sporting to get that perfect 50.         
	The impact the other two Nigerians have had on the team, although not quantifiable, is of no less importance.         
	Felix and Kalu were the two players the team wanted to release first when I took over as coach, Djordjevic said.         
	But I wanted to see them in action first before making a decision. After a few practice sessions and matches I made Kalu switch from offensive midfield to defensive midfield. He is more like (AC Milan player Gennaro) Gattuso, said the Serbian coach.

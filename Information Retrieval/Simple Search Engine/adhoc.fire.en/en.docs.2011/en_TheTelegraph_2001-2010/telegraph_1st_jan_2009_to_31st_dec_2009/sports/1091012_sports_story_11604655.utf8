	Paris: Italy scraped a draw against the Republic of Ireland to join Germany, Denmark and Serbia as the latest teams to secure 2010 World Cup places on a drama-laden penultimate batch of qualifiers.         
	This quartet join already-qualified England, Spain and the Netherlands, leaving two automatic berths from the continent still up for grabs heading into Wednesdays last throw of the South Africa dice.         
	A Simao Sabrosa double and a goal by Liedson gave Portugal a 3-0 victory over Hungary that took them within one win of a World Cup playoff berth.         
	Portugal, second in Group One, a point ahead of Sweden, will secure a playoff place if they beat Malta at home on Wednesday.         
	Russia, beaten 1-0 by ten-man Germany in Moscow, and the Republic of Ireland, are among the teams assured of places in Novembers two-leg play-offs.         
	France, beaten on penalties in the 2006 final by Italy, are also in the playoffs after routing part-timers the Faroe Islands 5-0 Saturday to book second place in Group Seven behind Serbia, who trounced Romania by the same scoreline.         
	The Irish came desperately close to pulling off a major upset in Dublin as Sean St Ledger headed them into a 2-1 lead with only three minutes to go, only for Alberto Gilardino to level on the whistle.         
	That put the world champions into an unassailable lead in Group Eight with Ireland as runners-up.         
	Mexico and the United States booked their places at the 2010 World Cup by winning their penultimate Concacaf group games Saturday.         
	Costa Rica moved up to the third and final automatic World Cup qualifying berth with a 4-0 home win over Trinidad and Tobago.         
	Chile, winning 4-2 at Colombia claimed the third of four automatic qualifying spots from South America for their first World Cup appearance since 1998. Colombia was eliminated.         
	Uruguay kept their World Cup hopes alive, winning 2-1 in Quito at 2,800 metres after Diego Forlan converted a penalty in the fourth minute of injury time. Uruguay will also advance automatically if they beats Argentina on Wednesday in Montevideo.         
	Meanwhile, Ronaldo has been ruled out of Portugals final qualifier against Malta on Wednesday after he aggravated an ankle injury in Saturdays win.         
	In African qualifiers Sunday, Nigerias slim World Cup hopes were kept alive as they squeezed out a narrow 1-0 home win over Mozambique in Group B.         
	Issam Jomaa scored an early goal in another Group B match to give Tunisia a 1-0 win over Kenya and take them a step closer to qualifying while Benin registered a 1-0 win over Ghana in Group D.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Serena to meet Elena 
                                                   Serena to meet Elena 
                      
	Toronto: World No. 2 Serena Williams brushed aside qualifier Lucie Safarova 6-3, 6-2 to reach the semi-finals of the Rogers Cup on Friday, where she was joined by a trio of Russians.         
	Serena needed just 57 minutes on a blustery centre court to breeze into the last four and set up a mouth-watering Wimbledon rematch with fourth seed Elena Dementieva, while Alisa Kleybanova will meet Maria Sharapova in the other semi-final.         
	Tennis fans can expect a treat if Serena and Dementieva serve up a repeat of their Wimbledon semis, which the American edged 8-6 in the third set. In contrast to Williamss quick-fire win, Dementieva was made to sweat for her spot in the last four, rallying for a 6-7, 6-1, 6-3 victory over feisty Australian Samantha Stosur.         
	But no player worked harder for her semi-final place than 36th ranked Kleybanova, who won a riveting three hour, 16 minute 6-7, 7-6, 6-2 slugfest over fifth-seeded Serb Jelena Jankovic.

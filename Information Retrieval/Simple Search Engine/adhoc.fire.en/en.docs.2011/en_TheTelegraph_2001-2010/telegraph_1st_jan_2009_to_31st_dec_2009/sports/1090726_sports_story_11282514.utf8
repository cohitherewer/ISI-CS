                                                   Beckham fined $1,000
                      
	New York: England midfielder David Beckham has been fined $1,000 by Major League Soccer (MLS) after an incident with a fan in Sundays friendly between Los Angeles Galaxy and AC Milan.         
	We support our players interacting with fans, whether it is at clinics, charity events or by high-fiving their supporters in the stands while celebrating a goal, MLS commissioner Don Garber said.         
	However, our players should never engage in conduct that can be interpreted as encouraging fans to come out of the stands and on to the field, regardless of the reason.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ishant thanks Zaheer
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ishant thanks Zaheer
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: When the chips are down, dont take suggestions from all and sundry. That would be asking for more trouble. Ishant Sharma learnt this the hard way.         
	Having been left out of Indias ODI squad, Ishant, who looked like getting back into rhythm during the two T20 Internationals against Sri Lanka, attributed his new-found confidence to just one man, who is none other than Zaheer Khan, his senior colleague in the national team.         
	A sportsman enjoys both highs and lows in his career. There was a point of time when I wasnt exactly bowling well. I was feeling down and started seeking suggestions from everybody. It made me all the more confused.         
	Then Zaheer spotted my mistakes. He guided me through that rough phase, the fast bowler told reporters on Monday, the eve of Delhis crucial Ranji Trophy match against Bengal.         
	So what exactly did Zaheer tell him? There were a few technical errors in my bowling. Zaheer corrected those.         
	Most importantly, the positioning of my left shoulder in the final delivery stride was wrong. Also, a few other things, for which I am grateful to him, he answered.         
	The lanky speedster, however, did not agree that his is a case of burnout as he has been over-bowled in the last 18 months. I dont agree. I believe if you chalk out a proper training schedule during an international series, burnout wont happen, he said.         
	Ishant said that his hard work at the nets during the two Test matches, when he was dropped, helped him a lot. If I have been able to bowl a good line in the last two T20 internationals, it is because of my efforts during those training sessions.         
	He insisted that there will not be any motivational problem in the match versus Bengal, even though he will be playing his first match for Delhi this season.         
	I have a job at hand. I will have to bowl well and ensure that Delhi reach the knock-out stage. Had I been low on motivation, I would have gone back home rather than coming to Calcutta, he said.         
	Asked about the pitch, he shot back. Ive never had a look at the pitch before a match in my career. Not even before international matches. But once Im bowling in a match, I do a basic reading after bowling a few deliveries. That helps in identifying the right areas.         
	Ishant returns a wry smile he is asked about the presence of his captain Sourav Ganguly (Ishant plays for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League, under Ganguly) and friends Wriddhiman Saha and Laxmi Ratan Shukla in the rival camp.         
	There is still some time for the IPL. Tomorrow (Tuesday), Ill be representing Delhi and those in the opposition are certainly not my friends, he remarked.

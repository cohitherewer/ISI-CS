                                                     SRK finalises strategy, but will miss auction
  - Umar Gul not being released, Knight Riders plan replacement only       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Shah Rukh Khan                                 
	Calcutta: Principal owner Shah Rukh Khan wont be seated at the table assigned to the Kolkata Knight Riders, but he chaired the meeting where the franchises strategy for Fridays Indian Premier League (IPL) auction was finalised.         
	The nearly hour-long session was held at Shah Rukhs Mumbai residence, Mannat, on Wednesday evening. Among those present were co-owners Juhi and Jay Mehta, captain Sourav Ganguly and adviser-in-charge John Buchanan.         
	Shah Rukh had, of course, been around during the first auction, in Mumbai, last February. His presence, not surprisingly, had lifted the profile of that headline-making event.         
	During Fridays auction, at a breathtakingly pretty Taj property in Goa, the Knight Riders would be represented by Mehta, Buchanan, Jeet Banerjee and Joy Bhattacharjya.         
	Team Shah Rukh, with Sourav (who too was present in the first auction) missing, that is.         
	Right now, Shah Rukh is busy promoting home (Red Chillies Entertainment) production Billu Barber. Besides, hes preparing for shoulder surgery, to be performed in all probability by Dr Sanjay Desai, later this month.         
	For obvious reasons, our strategy cant be disclosed. While options are open, its a fact that we already have a balanced team for this year, a well-placed source told The Telegraph on the eve of the auction.         
	As four players have been signed full-time in the lead-up to the auction, the Knight Riders wont be allowed to spend more than $ 1,210,000. Additionally, Shah Rukh and Co. have chosen not to release Umar Gul, but to seek a (one-year) replacement for him.         
	Therefore, the Knight Riders would only be looking to fill one slot and may target Jean-Paul Duminy, the highly gifted South African.         
	[The inaugural editions runners-up, Chennai Super Kings, alone have the entire $ 2 million available for the auction.]         
	We have eight overseas players (Ricky Ponting, Chris Gayle, Brendon McCullum, Ajantha Mendis, Brad Hodge, David Hussey, Angelo Matthews and Moses Henriques) on our rolls and have decided not to release Gul. So, only our 10th player needs to be picked, the well-placed source added.         
	Gul and the other Pakistanis have been barred by their government from turning out in the IPLs second edition, which gets under way on April 10.         
	The franchise, though, is hopeful that matters would improve and the ban on Gul and others lifted by Islamabad in 2010.         
	As Gul was bought for $ 150,000 last year, the Knight Riders can spend that much in getting his replacement.         
	Thats independent of the auction money.         
	Incidentally, all 50 players going under the hammer are committed to doing IPL duty for two years, this and the next.

                                                     Waugh too busy to coach KKR
            A STAFF REPORTER            Steve Waugh in the city on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Steve Waugh feels coaching the Kolkata Kinght Riders is a challenging prospect, though he ruled himself out of the job saying he had no time for it.         
	Waugh is being seen as a possible replacement for John Buchanan, who was removed Thursday from his post of the franchises director of cricket operations.         
	Speaking on Friday at the launch of the India chapter of his Waugh Foundation Global, the former Australia captain said: I am not ready for any new position. Its a challenging job but I dont know about the future. At the moment I am certainly not doing it, as I have no time At the moment Im occupied with too many things.         
	The 44-year old Aussie however, is excited by the games shortest format.         
	Twenty20 is an exciting format. Though it is quite unpredictable I enjoy it a lot. I must say that it has captured peoples imagination too.         
	Disappointed with Australias early exit from the ICC World Twenty20, Waugh said: Its very disappointing to see Australia out from the tournament so early I expected a lot from them and also from the Indians... But thats the nature of Twenty20 cricket You cannot predict anything. You got to be sharp and alert on that day. Anyone can lose in this format.         
	Asked why Aussies have lost their numero uno position in world cricket, Steve said that a team requires new ideas to stay ahead with the game becoming more competitive every day. Its pretty hard to dominate a sport for a long period It takes a lot of innovation to stay ahead. The Caribbeans did it for a period of 15 years; then we did it. Now India, South Africa and the Australians are on a par.         
	But as things appear at the moment I dont think anyone will be able to dominate the game for a long period, Waugh added.         
	Commenting on Buchanans exit after the Knight Riders poor showing in this years Indian Premier League (IPL), Waugh said the demands of coaching in India are very different from those in Australia. I think Buchanan should have mixed his support staff with Australians and Indians. That way it would have been easier for him.         
	Talking about Team India, Waugh said Mahendra Singh Dhoni was a fantastic captain, who, he felt needed a break at the moment.         
	It seems Dhonis honeymoon period is over. He should take a break now, Waugh said.         
	Comparing former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly with Dhoni, Waugh said: Sourav built the steel backbone of Indian cricket... Dhoni is a fantastic captain. He has brought in a calming rhythm.

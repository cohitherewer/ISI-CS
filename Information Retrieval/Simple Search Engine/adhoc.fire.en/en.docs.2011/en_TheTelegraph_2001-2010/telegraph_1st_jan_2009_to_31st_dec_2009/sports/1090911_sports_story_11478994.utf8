The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Edmilson, Subhas in slanging match 
                                                   Edmilson, Subhas in slanging match 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: There seems to be no end to East Bengals woes. The club crashed out of the season-opening IFA Shield following disastrous performances and, on Thursday, striker Edmilson got into a slanging match with coach Subhas Bhowmick during practice, a spat that culminated in the Brazilian reportedly beating up Saumik Dey inside the dressing room.         
	Edmilson, who failed to find a berth in the red and gold brigades Durand Cup squad, is likely to be show-caused by East Bengal.         
	It all began during a practice match in the morning. Saheb Ali Mondals tough tackle left Edmilson fuming and when the Brazilian retaliated, Bhowmick intervened. It led to a heated exchange between the coach and the striker.         
	With things appearing to be going out of control, Saumik tried to mediate but was pushed aside by Edmilson. When the match finally resumed, Edmilson was asked to stay put on the sidelines.         
	It looked like sanity had been restored, but Edmilson wasnt to stay quiet for long. As practice drew to a close, Edmilson wanted to join the players in the middle for the post-match cooling down session but the Brazilian was denied permission.         
	Edmilson threw a fit. He questioned Bhowmicks authority, and the coach gave him to understand it was he who was the boss and that every player was bound to obey his orders.         
	With Edmilson continuing his antics, the dressing room became the theatre of a fresh eruption. When Saumik tried once more to restore peace, Edmilson reportedly hit the defender.         
	The other footballers, who were taken aback by such an act, asked Edmilson to leave the dressing room immediately. Finding no support, the disgruntled striker was forced to leave the premises.         
	Both Bhowmick and Edmilson refused to comment on the incident. East Bengal football secretary Santosh Bhattacharjee said it was an internal matter and that the club would soon decide on the course of action.         
	East Bengal had earlier decided that the clubs core committee along with the football secretary would give their suggestions on football matters to coach Bhowmick. They now will also have to deal with the Edmilson issue.

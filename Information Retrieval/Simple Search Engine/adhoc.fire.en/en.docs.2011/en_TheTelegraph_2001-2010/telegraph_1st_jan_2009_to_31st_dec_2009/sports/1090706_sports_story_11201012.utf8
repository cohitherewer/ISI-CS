                                                     Opposition woos Sourav 
            A STAFF REPORTER            Sourav Ganguly                           
	Calcutta: The opposition, in a desperate attempt to oust Jagmohan Dalmiya, is trying hard to convince Sourav Ganguly to contest the presidents post in the upcoming Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) elections.         
	The dates for the annual general meeting are yet to be finalised but it is likely to be either July 29 or 30.         
	Sources close to the former India captain revealed there was no guarantee he would fight this time, though he may contest sooner rather than later.         
	The opposition, who have been holding a series of meetings almost everyday, are struggling to find a suitable candidate for the presidents post.         
	Former president Prasun Mukherjee, who was thrashed by Dalmiya in last years elections, is currently posted outside the state and that has left them struggling to fill the void.         
	We are looking for a heavyweight candidate and Sourav is the best choice He isnt very keen and has taken time till next week to decide, said a member of the opposition.         
	Sourav will add a new dimension to the CAB. It is time to bring in new ideas for cricket to get top priority in the state I dont think anyone will question his integrity and commitment, he added.         
	The prospect of Sourav contesting hasnt really sent the ruling Dalmiya group into a tizzy.         
	First, I believe the possibility is remote. Second, I dont think that will change equations all of a sudden.         
	Whoever contests, we will win by a huge margin and none can stop that from happening, said a Dalmiya confidant.         
	Weve fulfilled all our promises this time promotion to the Elite division of the Ranji Trophy, getting the Eden lease renewed, bailing out the CAB out of a financial mess.         
	If Sourav decides against joining the fray, this years AGM may not see a contest at all.         
	But in case he decides to contest, it will be surprising if Dalmiya stays in the fray. No one in the Maidan actually believes there will be a Sourav versus Dalmiya fight.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Real confirm Kaka signing
                                                   Real confirm Kaka signing
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	The biggest transfer deal in the history of football was completed on Monday night with Kaka moving from AC Milan to Real Madrid for 56million.         
	The Spanish club announced on their website shortly before midnight on Monday that the 27-year-old Brazilian had agreed a six-year contract.         
	Meanwhile, a statement on the Milan website read: From next season, Kaka will play at Real Madrid. AC Milan thanked the man and the great champion Kaka for his decisive contribution to the many victories achieved in the six years of his commitment.         
	 It will be very difficult to fill the void that will be left by Kaka, a shining example of professionalism and commitment.         
	Earlier on Monday the Brazilian Football Confederation agreed that Kaka could undergo a medical for Real even though Brazil face Paraguay in a World Cup qualification match on Wednesday.         
	 Kaka, who will now be at the forefront of a new era of Galacticos, will inherit the No. 5 shirt once worn by Zinedine Zidane. That is apt as it is the Frenchmans transfer record from Juventus to Real of 47 million, from 2001, that has been broken.

                                                   Harbhajan Singh: I dont do masti with my cricket
    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
	   - Indias most successful off-spinner gets candid             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  
	Johannesburg: Senior pro and Indias most successful off-spinner (330 wickets in Tests, 200-plus in ODIs), Harbhajan Singh, recently spoke to The Telegraph for around 45 minutes. He didnt duck any question.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q Anil Kumbles retirement last November has made you the senior spinner in all forms. Are you enjoying this responsibility?         
	A Actually, my role hasnt changed... I may not have been the senior-most when Anilbhai was around, but that made no difference to my approach on the field... I always saw it as my responsibility to get wickets, to help India win... That way, then, theres no change. In fact, I enjoy responsibility and look to better my performances.         
	Was Kumble a big influence?         
	I consider myself fortunate that I could play with him for so many years... One learns from top performers like him... He gave his best shot, always.         
	The point about responsibility is taken, but are you under more pressure now?         
	Yes, its more, because Anilbhai isnt around to share it... Share the burden, so to say... The expectations are higher, but I dont allow that to weigh me down... Main sochta nahin hoon.         
	How is pressure best handled?         
	(Grins) Dont think about it.         
	Isnt that being unrealistic?         
	Dont have worries and dont be fearful... At least, dont carry any of that to the field... If you do, then you wont be able to play to potential. Be positive and look to enjoy the moment.         
	Youre in your 12th year of international cricket. How has this journey, as Sachin Tendulkar would put it, been?         
	Good... Ive had my ups and downs... Theres still something to learn everyday, thats the attitude I have... Obviously, whatever I am today is because of cricket.         
	What have you learnt?         
	As a cricketer, Im still learning... As a person, Ive learnt to be humble... We get a lot of attention from everybody, but its important to have your feet firmly on the ground... Ive learnt from Sachin, Rahul (Dravid), Anilbhai... For all their achievements, theyre so simple. We dont need to go around thinking were special... Ive learnt to continue leading a normal life, despite being successful in my field... We should just be remembering that God has been kind... I do, at least... Im the type jo gharwalon ke kaam aye aur doosron ke bhi kaam aye.         
	Youve made mistakes...         
	I accept that... Early on in my career, I was quite stubborn... Had a lot of josh, which perhaps got misplaced... However, Ive definitely got better as a person and will try and get even better... Im the sort who is easy with everyone but, sometimes, I probably need to be careful.         
	Controversies have been a part of your career. Why?         
	Maloom nahin...         
	Last year alone, there was the Monkeygate affair in Australia and the Slapgate business during the IPL in India...         
	Im not bothered about what happened in Australia... People have said and written a lot of things without knowing what happened in the Sydney Test... But, yes, I made a mistake by slapping Sreesanth (in Mohali)... I paid a price, missing many matches. The punishment affected me.         
	That slap really disappointed fans...         
	I did disappoint, yes... Ive tried to make amends by becoming a better person and a better cricketer... Life doesnt stop with one incident and I hope my well-wishers will recognise what Ive done since the post-ban comeback and not keep going back to what shouldnt have happened. Ive been working very hard, believe me.         
	What are your feelings towards Andrew Symonds and Matthew Hayden, who described you in an offensive manner?         
	I dont have ill feelings... It had got to a point when the nations got involved  India versus Australia outside the field as well.         
	Symondss career is as good as over. Do you feel sorry for him?         
	No... Hes responsible for his actions... Hes the one getting into trouble with the authorities.         
	Are you yourself more thanda now?         
	(Laughs) Ive tried to be after the Sreesanth affair... Not too long ago, Id become furious if a catch got dropped off my bowling, not now... Ive accepted such happenings to be a part of the game. Even I drop catches.         
	What, for you, is the biggest challenge today?         
	To stay fit physically and remain fresh in the mind... Cricket, today, is exceedingly competitive and youve got to develop new skills to keep one step ahead of the other teams, which keep analysing you.         
	Purely as an off-spinner, how could you get better?         
	By adjusting better and more quickly to changing conditions... How many bowlers send down six different deliveries in each over?         
	You seem to be very involved at nets...         
	Of course... If Im bowling to Rahul, Im looking to improve myself, not help him get better with his batting... He could be the one in front of me, but Ill be imagining that Im bowling to X or Y from some other team. Im very serious about nets... Indeed, I dont do masti with my cricket... The sport has got me to where I am and I respect that... Cricket is God to me.         
	What would you have done had you not played for India?         
	Dont know... I know nothing besides cricket!         
	Your India debut was in early 1998. Has the cricket got tougher? Batsmen improvise a lot more and T20 is growing with a rocket-like speed...         
	Well, T20 wont encourage many spinners to toss the ball in the air... When I began playing ODIs, it used to be quite different... Batsmen would take singles and build an innings... Today, that has changed and they go for the big hits... Look to smash the bowling... Nowadays, a small error costs a lot more and the small grounds dont help us spinners... I guess its tough for the emerging ones.         
	So, what would you tell them?         
	That the game itself doesnt change, its how you think and how you face the challenges... Be it Test cricket or T20, youve got to be smart. In my view, if you can do the job in a Test match, then you can do the job anywhere. However, if youre good enough only for T20, then you cant do the job in Tests and ODIs... Its sad that I hardly get to see spinners who can turn the ball on any surface.         
	Why is that so?         
	Perhaps because of too much limited overs cricket... ODIs, T20... Theyre happy just rolling their arm over... They should, instead, express themselves and bowl the deliveries they can really be good at...         
	Do you see Test cricket threatened in a big way?         
	Where Im concerned, Test cricket is everything... It has that name because it tests everything  skills, mental toughness, physical strength, character... Batsmen, bowlers... Everyone has to pass the test... Where the threatened bit is concerned, its for the ICC to sort things out.         
	Is your approach different in the different forms?         
	Depends on the match, the conditions, whether were bowling first or second... Ive got to be flexible... The teams plans, too, have to be flexible. I like to attack, but I wont when the batsmen are going great guns... At that stage, Ill have to restrict. So, flexibility is the name of the game. (After a pause) The days of two maidens in a row, in Test cricket, I think have gone.         
	The final one: Have you set a goal for yourself?         
	(Grins) To help India win the 2011 World Cup and to do an Anilbhai and finish with 600 Test wickets... Yeh do goal hain, the rest is up to God.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ferreira hails a breakthrough
                                                     Ferreira hails a breakthrough
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Ferreira                           
	Mumbai: Hailing Pankaj Advanis world professional billiards title triumph as a breakthrough for Indian sport, the cueist fraternity Monday said that the Bangalore youngster has opened the door for Generation Next with his record-breaking performance.         
	In India, we are not bothered about sport, but only about sports personalities. And Pankaj (Advani) is turning out to be a person youngsters can relate to. He has set the benchmark, billiards legend Michael Ferreira told The Telegraph.         
	It is a major step (for Indian cue sports). Not just because its a world title, we are used to that, but he beat a formidable opponent. Its a breakthrough.         
	Yasin Merchant, the 2002 Asian Games gold medallist in snooker doubles, said: Advanis win is significant because a legend (Mike Russell) has been dethroned. This should open the door for his contemporaries.         
	Russell has been ruling the sport for years and to beat him in his home and that too in a world final is terrific This will inspire fellow Indians. He has shown its possible if you set your mind on it.         
	Ferreira rejected suggestions that Russell was a fading force.         
	Many are saying that he (Russell) has gone to Qatar and since he has been coaching, he was not at his best. I dont buy that rubbish, the 71-year-old Bombay Tiger said.         
	If you say (Rafael) Nadal would have won had he not been injured, I say its part of life. I think Pankaj was mentally strong because he beat him outright.         
	Merchant, the 2001 ACBS snooker champion, said he was not surprised by Advanis feat.         
	I was following Russell in the last two-three tournaments on the internet. Unlike others who thought Russell would walk through I felt Advani had a 50-50 chance, the 44-year-old said.         
	Russell has not been at his best, so it didnt come as a complete shock to me.         
	Merchant wondered, given Advanis age (24), how further the youngster could raise the bar for his compatriots. He is going to play at least 15 years more, I dont know what all things he is going to win. He is blazing a trail for others. He is going to create records which will take years to even equal, he said.         
	It (the title) has gone to a very deserving guy. He is dedicated and hard working. He knows what he wants in life. Success should go to such people.         
	Both Ferreira and Merchant, however, felt that winning the world professional snooker title was still way off for any Indian at the moment.         
	Very, very far. I dont think it (Advani winning) will happen, if I can be brutal, said Ferreira.         
	Merchant said: No way! Not right now. Professional snooker is a different ball game altogether and, believe me, I have played it, it will take him (Advani) at least 4-5 years to just get the feel. It is almost unattainable for an Indian at this stage.

	Kanpur: The Jaypee group will be constructing a state-of-the-art cricket stadium in Greater Noida. The work is expected to be completed by 2011. The BCCI vice-president and UPCA secretary Rajeev Shukla said that the state association would be taking the ground on a 50-year-lease.         
	The stadium will be located at the Gautam Buddha Nagar in Greater Noida. It will have a gymnasium, swimming pool and a club house. We also plan to have an academy. Once completed in 2011, we can have IPL matches and even ODIs at this venue, Shukla added.

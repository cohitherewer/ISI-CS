                                                   JCT hold Bagan; Sporting draw
                      
	Ludhiana/Margao: A late strike by Amandeep Singh helped JCT hold Calcutta giants Mohun Bagan 1-1 in the ONGC I-League at the Guru Nanak Stadium here on Saturday.         
	Bagan drew first blood in the 10th minute of the match through N.S. Manju, who made no mistake in finding the net off a Barreto cross.         
	Down by a goal, JCT pressed hard to draw parity and ultimately managed to wipe off the deficit in 80th minute through midfielder Amandeep.         
	With this draw Mohun Bagan have accumulated 37 points from 19 matches, while JCT has 22 points from 20 matches. In Margao, Sporting Clube de Goa squandered an early lead as their title hopes suffered a big jolt after being held to a 2-2 draw by Mahindra United.         
	Sporting, playing a must-win match, took the lead in 28th minute when Junior Obagbemiro scored from a penalty.         
	The Goan team were awarded a penalty when Nathaniel Amos was stopped illegally by defender Lamine Tamba.         
	However, Sportings joy was short-lived as Mahindra soon retaliated through a penalty in the 35th minute after defender Mathew Gonsalves brought down Mahindras Mohammed Rafi inside the box.         
	Edeh Chidi beat Sporting goalkeeper Felix DSouza to make it 1-1. Mahindra surged ahead in the 52nd minute through Douhou Pierre, who ran through the rival defence and beat keeper Felix with a deft placement after accepting a pass from the middle.         
	In the 77th minute, Sportings Nathaniel received a deflection ball and quickly relayed it to Obagbemiro, who flicked the ball home and levelled the score. Sporting are on second place with 40 points from 21 matches. Mahindra United remained fourth with 28 points.

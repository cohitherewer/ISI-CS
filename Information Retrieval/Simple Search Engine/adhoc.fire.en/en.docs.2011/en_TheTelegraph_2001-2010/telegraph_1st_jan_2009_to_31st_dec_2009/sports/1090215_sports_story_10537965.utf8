The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | City lose to Portsmouth
                                                   City lose to Portsmouth
                      
	London: Portsmouth emerged from their recent slump to beat Manchester City 2-0 in the Premier League on Saturday, their first match since Tony Adams was sacked as manager.         
	Goals from defenders Glen Johnson and Hermann Hreidarsson eased the south coast clubs relegation fears as they took three points for the first time since November.         
	With no other league matches taking place because of the FA Cup, Portsmouth, with Paul Hart in temporary charge, took advantage to move four points above the relegation zone.         
	Portsmouth keeper David James, celebrating a record 536th Premier League appearance, was able to cap his landmark with a clean sheet, saving well from Citys only real chance in the closing minutes.         
	Portsmouth started well, with on-loan winger Jermaine Pennant looking bright in possession.         
	Johnson broke the deadlock with a brilliant finish 20 minutes from time before Hreidarssons thumping header condemned City to a dismal defeat. Big-spending City have won just once in 12 away league matches. (REUTERS)

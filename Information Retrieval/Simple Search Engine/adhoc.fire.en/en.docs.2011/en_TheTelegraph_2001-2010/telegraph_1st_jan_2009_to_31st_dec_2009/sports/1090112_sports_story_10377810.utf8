The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murray is now bookies darling
                                                   Murray is now bookies darling
            Mark Hodgkinson                      
	British bookmakers have not always shown their love and admiration for this countrys tennis players, as it was just a couple of seasons ago that they were suggesting that there was more chance of Martians landing on Centre Court than of a British woman becoming Wimbledon champion (and, in truth, who can blame them for having taken such a view?). But now we are into new territory, with a British man listed as the pre-tournament favourite for a Grand Slam title.         
	And it is not just the British bookies who feel that no one is better placed than Andy Murray to become the 2009 Australian Open champion  a glance at the odds on offer in Melbourne indicates that such a belief is shared on the other side of the world. It has come to something when the Aussies are thinking that a Pom could win their tournament, which starts a week Monday. Murray has silenced the Pommie-bashers. For now.         
	To think it was only last summer, on the Wimbledon grass, that Murray made his first appearance in a Grand Slam quarter final. And now the bookies believe that he has a greater chance of success in Australia than Roger Federer, who has 13 Grand Slam titles, a greater chance than Rafael Nadal, the world No.1, and a greater chance than Novak Djokovic, who will be defending his title at Melbourne Park.         
	That is because Murray has started 2009 so well. He beat Federer and Nadal in a pre-season exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi, and in Doha defeated the Swiss once more in Fridays semi-finals before finishing off the job by trumping American Andy Roddick Saturday. Murrays results in the Middle-East could not have been better.         
	When the draw is made in Australia, Federer will not want Murray in his half, and Nadal would not like the world No.4 as a potential semi-final opponent either. And that is even though Murrays longest run on the Melbourne drawsheet was in 2007, when he made the fourth round and took Nadal to five sets, a match that finished around 2am.         
	The only doubt around Murray Saturday was concerning his lower back, as he had received treatment for stiffness during the victory over Federer, and it would have been foolish for him to have taken a risk with his health ahead of the Melbourne Slam just for the sake of trying to retain his title and golden eagle trophy in Doha.         
	When Murray zips up his racket-bag for the last time we will not be rushing to count his titles in Qatar. So it would have been understandable if Murray had not made it on court Saturday.         
	But Saturday, as soon as Murray was seen going through his usual pre-match routine of a game of tennis football with his support staff, it seemed as though he was going to play.         
	So it would appear that the discomfort in his back is not as much of a problem as some of the pre-Australian Open issues facing a few of the other leading players.         
	Are we just three weeks away from a British man winning a Slam singles title for the first time in 73 years, when Fred Perry was the 1936 US Open champion? Dont bet against it.

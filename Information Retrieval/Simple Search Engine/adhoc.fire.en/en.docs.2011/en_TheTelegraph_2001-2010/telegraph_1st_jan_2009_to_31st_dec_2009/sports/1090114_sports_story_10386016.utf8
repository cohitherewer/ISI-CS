                                                   CAB clears foreigners 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), handicapped by the existing rules or the lack of it, on Tuesday cleared Mohun Bagans plea to register foreign players for the ongoing local season.         
	At the end of the emergency tournament committee meeting, the association acknowledged its helplessness in barring any club from registering any number of foreign players under the existing rules.         
	The CAB in a media release, however, said that the relevant rules need amendment and that efforts towards the same will be made before the start of the next season.         
	Following the decision, Bagan registered as many as five foreigners for the season. They added three more to the existing Sri Lankan duo of Chaminda Vaas and Tillekeratne Dilshan  Bangladesh captain Mohammed Ashraful, opener Tamim Iqbal and pacer Mahbubul Alam. However, Vaas will be the only one available to play in the ongoing JC Mukherjee Trophy.         
	Kalighat, who made the quarters on Tuesday, is also in talks with some international cricketers. Ajantha Mendiss name is doing the rounds.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rafael to meet Nikolay 
                                                   Rafael to meet Nikolay 
                      
	Shanghai: Rafael Nadal reached the final of the Shanghai Masters when Feliciano Lopez retired on Saturday, the second evening in a row when the top seeded Spaniards opponent had to withdraw injured.         
	World No. 2 Nadal was coasting at 6-1, 3-0 when his compatriot Lopez, struggling with an ankle injury, became the ninth player to fail to finish a match at the $3.24 million tournament.         
	The 23-year-old will face Nikolay Davydenko in Sundays final after the Russian sprang an upset on second seed Novak Djokovic with a 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 victory.         
	Nadal, who benefited from Ivan Ljubicics withdrawal to reach the last four, has not played a tour final since Mays Madrid Masters as knee and abdominal injuries disrupted his season.         
	I was playing well, he told reporters. Im in the final which is very good news for me. Im very happy, its my first final since my comebcak from injury.         
	Lopez found an ace to help him win the opening game of the match but from then on Nadal dominated, winning the next six in a row and claiming the first set when his opponent went long.         
	The world No. 41 turned his right ankle on that point and the match was over as a contest, Lopez bringing it to its inevitable conclusion 21 minutes later.         
	Lopezs retirement can only fuel the debate about the length of the mens season, which was sparked on Monday when Andy Roddick branded it ridiculous and said it threatened to shorten the careers of the top players.         
	Sixth seed Davydenko lost twice to Djokovic at the Masters Cup here last season but was an altogether different proposition on Saturday.         
	The 28-year-old kept Djokovic under pressure throughout the three-hour contest before running away with the deciding tiebreak 7-1.         
	The match was long and heavy, Davydenko told reporters.         
	This was really difficult all match. I was lucky, he was lucky. In the tiebreak, I was more lucky.           (REUTERS)

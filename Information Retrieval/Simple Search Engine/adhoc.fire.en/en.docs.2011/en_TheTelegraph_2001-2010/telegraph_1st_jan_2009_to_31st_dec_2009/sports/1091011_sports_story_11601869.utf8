                                                     Refuelling ban good: Coulthard
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            David Coulthard                           
	Mumbai: Former Formula One driver David Coulthard feels that the ban on refuelling, which will be implied from 2010, will make F1 more exciting and would be an important factor in deciding the ultimate winner.         
	Coulthard, now a consultant to Red Bull Racing team, shared his views about the sport and India with the media at a promotional here on Saturday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On his early retirement         
	You cant keep going forever. The thing is to know when you should stop. Anything you do in life, you need to know when to stop. You need to know when to stop speaking, you need to know when to stop preaching... I think I got the timing right.         
	On the refuelling ban from 2010         
	Its a good thing not to have refuelling. The challenge for the driver is to look after his brake and his tyres between the pit stops.         
	At the moment, the longest time taken at the pit stop is while refuelling, without which the mechanics will change the tyres in a couple of seconds. Visually, it will be an amazing example of teamwork and preparation and that will the key to whether you win or lose the race.         
	The car he would be driving on the Sea Link         
	Its the car I first drove in 2005. That means I must have crashed it many times. Its fitted with V10 engines, more powerful than the currently used V8.         
	Its more practical to bring in an old car than the current one because you know the condition of the roads in India It would be destroyed.         
	The maximum speed he can do Sunday         
	I am not sure. Apparently there is a speed limit and we cannot go above it. I think it is about 100 kmph. I dont think I intend to drive in India again, so I think I will just go flat out!         
	If he had any idea about Indias most popular game  cricket         
	I went for the game of cricket, one that you people are crazy about, for the first time Friday (in New Delhi). We dont really have a culture of cricket in Scotland and so I dont know much about the game.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pak hockey, squash teams visit called off
                                                   Pak hockey, squash teams visit called off
                      
	Karachi/New Delhi: Pakistans hockey and squash teams visit to India has been called off.         
	The Pakistan hockey team was supposed to take part in the four-nation Punjab Gold Cup, scheduled to start in Chandigarh from January 31, while the squash team was to defend its Asian Junior title in Chennai. The tournament was supposed to start from January 16.         
	However, the decision to cancel the hockey teams trip was taken after Pakistan was replaced by New Zealand in the double-leg tournament that also features Beijing Olympic gold medallist Germany, the Netherlands, besides hosts India.         
	The hockey and squash federations had applied for clearance to travel to India which we have not given as there are security concerns, Pakistan sports minister Aftab Shah Jillani said.         
	He said due to the existing tension between the two countries, the ministry thought it prudent not to send the teams to India.         
	Until the relations and conditions improve between the two countries we dont think it is wise to send our teams there. There are security threats, Jillani said.         
	However, sports secretary Ashraf Khan said the decision does not mean that Pakistan has suspended sporting ties with India.         
	I wouldnt say we have suspended sporting ties with India. We are willing to play India at a neutral venue, Khan said.         
	There were genuine apprehensions about the security of our players if they went to India given the conditions in the region. But it is not a suspension of sporting ties, Khan insisted.         
	However, theres strong feeling that preventing the hockey and squash teams from travelling across the border could be a retaliatory gesture since the Indian government had earlier decided against sending its cricket team to Pakistan in the aftermath of the Mumbai terror attacks.         
	Meanwhile, the Indian Olympic Associations (IOA) ad hoc committee on hockey insisted that Pakistan had conveyed neither their willingness nor their inability to participate in the event. We didnt get any official confirmation from Pakistan, ad hoc committee media advisor Anupam Gulati said.         
	Asked what the organisers would do if the Pakistan government gave the green signal to tour India, Gulati said: We will take up the matter when it comes up but so far nothing has come to us.         
	Former Olympian and director of Punjab sports department Pargat Singh said they have dropped Jalandhar as a venue for the Punjab Gold Cup because of the unavailability of quality astroturf in the Surjit Singh Memorial Stadium.

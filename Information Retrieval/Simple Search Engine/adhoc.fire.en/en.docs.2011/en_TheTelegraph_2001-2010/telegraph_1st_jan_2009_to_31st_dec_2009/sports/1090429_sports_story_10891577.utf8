The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barreto injury no worry for Karim
                                                   Barreto injury no worry for Karim
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa feels that the likely absence of Jose Ramirez Barreto, who underwent plastic surgery on his tongue on Monday, for their next AFC Cup match against Jordans Al Wehdat on May 5 wouldnt be a problem.         
	We have played without Barreto and Bhaichung on quite a few occasions this season and I dont think it would be a problem this time. I have able replacements in my squad, said the Moroccan.         
	The Brazilian suffered a deep cut on his tongue during their Super Cup match against I-League champions Churchill Brothers, which the green and maroon brigade won 2-1.         
	He had a bad injury and is recovering. Except for a miracle, I dont think we will be getting his services in the next match, Karim said.         
	Meanwhile, sources close to the team said that Ishfaq Ahmed will be staying at Mohun Bagan for one more season.         
	N.S. Manju, N. Mohanraj and Anand Vasan are also expected to follow suit.

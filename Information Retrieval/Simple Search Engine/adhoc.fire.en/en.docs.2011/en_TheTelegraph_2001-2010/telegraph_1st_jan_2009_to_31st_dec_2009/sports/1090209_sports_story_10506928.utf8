The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gangjee finishes tied 7th
                                                   Gangjee finishes tied 7th
                      
	Bangkok: Rahil Gangjee brought home his worst card of the week, a one-under 70, but still managed the best finish among the Indians at tied seventh after the final round of the season-opening Asian Tour International golf tournament on Sunday.         
	Gangjee totalled 12-under 272 to be richer by $7,620.         
	Among the other Indians, Gaurav Ghei finished tied 30th after carding an identical one-under 70 to take his aggregate to five-under 279, just one stroke ahead of compatriot Gaganjeet Bhullar (73). However, the worst Indian at tied 57th was Digvijay Singh who carded a level-par 71 to total 284 in the tournament.         
	South Africas James Kamte fired a five-under 66 to pip Japanese Tetsuji Hiratsuka (71) by two strokes and clinch his maiden title with an aggregate of 16-under 268 at the Suwan Golf and Country Club.         
	Overnight leader Hiratsuka, who came into the final round with a slender one shot lead, finished on even-par 71 for a 270 total to take second place.         
	Australias Unho Park and Marcus Both together with Thailands Prom Meesawat and Philippines Juvic Pagunsan all took a share of third place on matching 271s.         
	Kamte got off quickly with two birdies on his opening two holes. He survived a nasty scare on the fifth hole when he dropped a shot for bogey which allowed Park to move ahead of him at that stage.         
	However, the South African stormed into contention after the turn with birdies on the 11th, 13th and 16th holes when the others began to falter.         
	To win the first tournament as a rookie on the Asian Tour is really a dream come true, said Kamte, who also took home the winners purse of $47,550. (AGENCIES)

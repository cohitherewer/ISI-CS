                                                     PCB bars Shoaib from national T20
                  Akhtar                     
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has barred controversial fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar from playing in the national T20 tournament. Akhtar was earlier dropped from the national squad for the World T20 Cup because of a skin infection.         
	A PCB official said that they have informed the Islamabad Cricket Association that the fast bowler would be in violation of his central contract if he played in the national event despite a medial advice that he needs to rest for 10 to 12 days to recover from a skin infection. Akhtar, who was dropped from squad last week on fitness grounds, had intended to take on the authorities by leading the Islamabad team in the national championship.         
	He was in Karachi last night for a function but he refused to comment on the issue.           (PTI)

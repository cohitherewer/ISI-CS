The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fifth ODI is still uncertain
                                                   Fifth ODI is still uncertain
                      
	Bridgetown: England could be left standing at the altar if the West Indies team carries out its threat to boycott the decisive fifth and final one-day International at the Beausejour Cricket Ground Friday.         
	England still do not know if their opponents will show up for the match, since there has been no clear indication from either the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) or the West Indies Players Association (WIPA) about the status of their ongoing dispute.         
	The issues causing the stand-off between the two sides in the Caribbean include terms and conditions, as well as outstanding payments and a new pay structure for players in the West Indies first-class competition.         
	The WICB provided a comprehensive broad-based proposal to the players to cover a new fee structure, but WIPA rejected the offer. (AFP)

	London: World No.1 Rafael Nadal wasted little time steering Spain into the Davis Cup quarter finals with a crushing win over Serbias Novak Djokovic on Sunday.         
	After a 4-1 victory condensed into two days because of weather problems in Benidorm, Spain will take on former champions Germany in the quarter finals.         
	Argentina will play the Czech Republic, Croatia will meet the United States and Russia face Israel on the weekend of July 10-12.         
	The Israelis, who had to go through the playoffs last year to stay in the world group, beat seven-times champions Sweden 3-2 in Malmo in a tie closed to the public because of security fears.         
	World No.3 Djokovic and his fellow Serbians blamed lack of practice time on clay for their struggles in Benidorm, where high winds damaged the stadium and delayed the start.         
	Serbia also had to contend with an in-form Nadal, who notched up his 12th straight Davis Cup singles victory with a 6-4, 6-4, 6-1 win over Djokovic, a day after dropping just three games in beating Janko Tipsarevic.         
	Djokovic also lost to David Ferrer and Serbias only win came in doubles when Viktor Troicki and Nenad Zimonjic beat Feliciano Lopez and Tommy Robredo.         
	Argentina and Croatia enjoyed the most straightforward routes to the last eight with 5-0 wins over The Netherlands and Chile.         
	Argentina, runners-up last year, were without their top three players but Juan Ignacio Chela and Martin Vassallo Arguello completed the rout in Buenos Aires with straight-sets wins over Thiemo de Bakker and Matwe Middelkoop.         
	Russia beat Romania 4-1 in Sibiu after Dmitry Tursunov, a substitute for former world No.1 Marat Safin, clinched the deciding point with a 4-6, 5-7, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 win over Victor Hanescu in the first reverse singles.         
	Nicolas Kiefer proved the linchpin for Germany, beating Austrias Juergen Melzer 7-6, 6-4, 6-4 on Sunday after helping Philipp Kohlschreiber to win Saturdays doubles.         
	Radek Stepanek, inspired by success in Saturdays doubles with Tomas Berdych, clinched the vital point for the Czech Republic against nine-time champions France on Sunday.         
	The 30-year-old Stepanek beat Gilles Simon, ranked 10 places above him at eighth, 7-6, 6-3, 7-6 in Ostrava to put the Czechs through.         
	Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who beat Stepanek in Fridays opening singles, overcame Jan Hernych 6-2, 6-7, 7-6 in the fifth rubber but it was too late.         
	A fighting, five-set win by Harel Levy over Andreas Vinciguerra put Israel through to the last eight for only the second time.         
	The roller-coaster end to the match was witnessed only by around 400 journalists and guests after local authorities, worried about protests over Israels participation, shut Malmos Baltic Hall to the public.         
	American Andy Roddick lived up to his nickname The Closer in Birmingham, Alabama, overcoming Stanislas Wawrinka, Switzerlands top player in the absence of the injured Roger Federer, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 in the first reverse singles.

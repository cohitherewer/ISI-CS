The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We lost the plot: Gayle
                                                   We lost the plot: Gayle
                      
	London: West Indies captain Chris Gayle conceded that his team had lost the plot after a rash of dropped catches and some feeble batting which led to a 10-wicket defeat in the first Test against England within three days at Lords.         
	We lost the plot, said Gayle, who contributed only 28 and a duck after arriving in England on Monday from the Indian Premier League.         
	Obviously we are very disappointed in the manner in which we lost the game in three days. Having said all of that we have to give credit to England. They played some good cricket and they held on to their chances.         
	The two sides meet at Chester-le-Street in north-east England on Thursday in the second and final Test which West Indies must win to retain the Wisden Trophy they regained this year.

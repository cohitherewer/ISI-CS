The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vasco hold Dempo
                                                   Vasco hold Dempo
                      
	Margao: Dempo Sports Club and Vasco Sports Club split points after playing out an exciting 2-2 draw in a 14th round I-League clash at the Nehru stadium in Fatorda.         
	Uzbek strikers Sherzod Nazarov and Yorkin Nazarov scored a goal each for Vasco while Clifford Miranda and captain Climax Lawrence saved Dempo the blushes.         
	Dempo were jolted very early after Sherzod curled in a free-kick past the wall to give his side the lead in the third minute of the match. However, they Dempo drew level in the 27th minute after a cross from Valerian Rebello saw Brazilian Roberto Mendes Silva and Ranty Martins miss in quick succession in the danger zone before Miranda managed to get a faint touch into the goal. The teams were tied 1-1 at half-time.         
	Even after being a goal down, Dempo were the more dominant side. Martins and Anthony Pereira combined well upfront but were unlucky as the ball either hit the goalpost or sailed inches wide.         
	In the second half, Vasco again took the lead through Yorkin, who tapped in a nice cross from the right flank by Lester Fernandes. Immediately, Dempo were awarded a penalty as Vasco defender Covan Lawrence handled Samir Naiks long throw-in.         
	Ranty stepped up to take the spot kick but Vasco goalkeeper Laxmikant Kattymani made a brilliant diving save. Dempo captain Lawrence saved his team the blushes three minutes before the final whistle when his 30-yarder found the far corner of the nets. He was named the Man of the Match.

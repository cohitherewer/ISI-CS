                  Shane Watson in Abu Dhabi on Sunday                     
	Abu Dhabi: All-rounder Shane Watson struck a brilliant hundred to guide Australia to a commanding 250 for four in the fifth and final one-day International against Pakistan at Abu Dhabi Stadium here Sunday.               
	Pakistan won the fifth one-dayer by seven wickets with 18 balls to spare. Kamran Akmal (116) and Misbah-ul Haq (76) remained not out               
	The 27-year-old right-hander made 116 and shared solid stands of 58 for the first wicket with Brad Haddin (36) and another 57 for the third with Michael Clarke (26) after Australia won the toss and batted.         
	Watson, who came into this series after missing action for some time since a stress fracture on the back in November last year, struck six boundaries and two sixes off pacer Umar Gul and Yasir Arafat to score his second one-day hundred. He also added 84 for the unfinished fifth-wicket stand with Callum Ferguson (41 not out) as Australia scored 54 in the last 10 overs.         
	Watsons partnership with Haddin gave Australia a brisk start before Shoaib Akhtar separated the two, claiming Haddin, who was caught by Younus Khan off a miscued drive. Haddin hit seven boundaries.         
	Off-spinner Saeed Ajmal, removed Marcus North, having him stumped by wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal.           (AFP)

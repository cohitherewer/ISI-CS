            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Skipper Bhaichung Bhutia was released from the national camp in Goa on Thursday after an MRI scan revealed a calf-muscle strain that would take around 10 days to heal.         
	According to team sources, the ace striker, who has been advised a weeks complete rest, would go back to Calcutta after consulting a specialist in Mumbai on Friday.         
	There is nothing much to worry about Bhaichungs injury, a team official said.         
	Meanwhile, also on Thursday, Goas Dempo Sports Club refused to release two injured footballers for the national camp yet.         
	The players in question  Mahesh Gawli and Samir Naik  have not joined the camp that started in Goa earlier this week under chief coach Bob Houghton.         
	This despite the federation writing to Dempo saying the rehabilitation of the injured footballers should be done at the national camp.         
	In a letter to the AIFF on Thursday, Dempo said they had decided against sending the players to the camp as they were yet to recover from their injuries.

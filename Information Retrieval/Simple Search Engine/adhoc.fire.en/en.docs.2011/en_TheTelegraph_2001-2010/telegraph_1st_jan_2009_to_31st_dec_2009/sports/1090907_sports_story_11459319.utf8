	Rosario: A 3-1 home defeat to arch-rivals Brazil has complicated Argentinas hopes of reaching the World Cup finals, coach Diego Maradona said on Saturday.         
	We have to go to Paraguay to see if we can win the three points, Maradona told reporters, looking ahead to Wednesdays next qualifier in Asuncion.         
	Its going to be tough, complicated and all the more so after todays defeat. To lose to Brazil is always bad and we had hopes of winning this match to get near the World Cup.         
	Maradona refused to blame his players. Im not complaining about my players... We mustnt jump on (Lionel) Messi because he doesnt play alone, he said. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Alford trips on day of upsets
                                                                                                                       7                                                                                      Alford trips on day of upsets 
            STAR RACER      
	Calcutta: Jockey C. Alford guided the Pesi Shroff-trained odds on favourite Recardo to an easy victory in the 1,400m Bol Publication Cup on Wednesday. The champion jockey, however, failed to do anything worthwhile on trainer Vijay Singhs trio of Strike A Deal, Washington Irvine and Glamorous Spirit in their respective events, on an afternoon which was ruled by less-fancied winners.          
	Recardo was taken to the front after Arkhos and Elegant Road called the shots till about a furlong from home for a facile victory over Black Dahlia. Similar riding tactics applied by the jockey on the three beaten hot favourites, however, bore no fruit. Incidentally, each of the three favourites occupied the third place to the disappointment of a large mid-week race crowd.

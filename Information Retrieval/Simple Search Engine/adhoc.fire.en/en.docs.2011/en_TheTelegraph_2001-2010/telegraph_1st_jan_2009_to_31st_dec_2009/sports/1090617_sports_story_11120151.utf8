The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | F1 crisis deepens
                                                   F1 crisis deepens
                      
	London: Formula One moved closer to the edge on Tuesday when the governing body said crisis talks with teams had broken down and next years controversial rules remained unchanged.         
	Financial experts from the teams association (Fota) and International Automobile Federation (FIA) had met on Monday to try and overcome a stand-off over a budget cap that threatens to tear the sport apart.         
	Unfortunately, the Fota representatives announced that they had no mandate to discuss the FIAs 2010 financial regulations. Indeed, they were not prepared to discuss regulation at all, the FIA said in a statement.         
	As a result, the meeting could not achieve its purpose of comparing the FIAs rules with the Fota proposals with a view to finding a common position.         
	In default of a proper dialogue, the Fota financial proposals were discussed but it became clear that these would not be capable of limiting the expenditure of a team which had the resources to outspend its competitors. Another financial arms race would then be inevitable.         
	The FIA Financial Regulations therefore remain as published. (REUTERS)

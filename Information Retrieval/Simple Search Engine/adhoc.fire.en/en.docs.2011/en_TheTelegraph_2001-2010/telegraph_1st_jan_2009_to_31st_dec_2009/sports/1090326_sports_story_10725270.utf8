The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sutil sure   of good showing
                                                   Sutil sure   of good showing
                            
	Melbourne: The mid-field target may take time to materialise but Force India driver Adrian Sutil is confident that the VJM02 will shed the back-markers tag early this Formula One season.         
	Set to hit the track for the season opener at the Albert Park here on Sunday, Sutil oozed confidence about the cars reliability even though he was modest about the outfits imminent goal.         
	I hope we can beat a few teams already at the start of the season but I dont want to say too much. Its a goal but perhaps not for the first race, the German said.         
	Sutil didnt read too much into the winter testing of the teams and said a clearer picture of where the teams stand would emerge only once the championship gets underway.         
	Its difficult to say right now (where we are). The winter tests are always hard to get a real reading out of it as everyone is doing different programmes  you never know who is running light fuel or heavy fuel.         
	We did our programme and I have a feeling where we will be, he said.           (PTI)

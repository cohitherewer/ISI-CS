The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ferguson is banking on the young Turks
                                                   Ferguson is banking on the young Turks
            Mark Ogden       
	Sir Alex Ferguson is backing Manchester Uniteds new wave of young prospects to lead the club to renewed success this season, despite the 80m sale of Cristiano Ronaldo.         
	Manchester United begin a new era without the Portuguese forward when they launch their defence of the Premier League title against Birmingham on Sunday.         
	Having added just three signings to his squad in the summer  Michael Owen, Antonio Valencia and Gabriel Obertan  many have questioned Uniteds ability to claim a historic fourth successive title this term.         
	But Ferguson insists that Uniteds youngsters are good enough to keep the club on course for silverware this season and beyond.         
	Ferguson said: We have a lot of young players who want to do well and thats the area that most encourages me. Our critics are misreading the situation in terms of the young players improving. They are improving and there are some good signs there. We have a very good, strong squad and we are where we want to be. Numbers wise, we have a lot of young players and that is encouraging, with the likes of Federico Macheda and Danny Welbeck who have both played for their U-21s this week.         
	They are developing very well. We also have the Da Silva twins and Darron Gibson, who is going to be a really top player. He has come on fantastically well. We also have Nani and Anderson, at 21 and 22, so I am quite happy with what weve got.         
	Having scored 68 goals in his last two seasons at United, Ferguson admits that his team will miss the presence of Ronaldo.         
	But he insists that he is excited by the challenge of proving that there can be life after the Real Madrid star.         
	Ferguson said: Most of the players probably expected Ronaldo to leave at some point, so its not such a great shock them that he has left. The problem, of course, is how we progress as a football team, in a different shape and different way to when Ronaldo was here.         
	That really is something I am looking forward to and Im interested in seeing that progress because it will be different without Cristiano. And then we have someone of (Wayne) Rooneys calibre.         
	Despite the comings and goings at Old Trafford this summer, Ferguson admits that the pain and disappointment of defeat against Barcelona in the Champions League final still lingers and he believes that the only way to overcome the bitter memory is by bouncing back at the first opportunity.         
	Ferguson said: When you lose the last game of the season, you have two or three months to reflect on the disappointment and we havent enjoyed that. But well cope and we will bounce back. Weve tasted two European Cup finals in a row now and weve experienced emotions at either end of the spectrum, but adversity is always an important factor in developing and improving. Ive always reacted well to adversity over the years and, whenever we lose a match, I tell my players that the next one is the important one.         
	Thats the match we focus on and that has always been the case here at the club.         
	United are due to learn their Champions League group opponents in two weeks time and Ferguson admits that the target this term is the same as ever  to reach the final.         
	He said: We won the Champions League with the excitement of a penalty shoot-out in Moscow on a pouring wet night and then we lost in Rome on a really humid night. Those experiences will help us and hopefully we can be there again in Madrid next May.         
	United are facing doubts over the fitness of defender Jonny Evans prior to Sundays Old Trafford opener against Alex McLeishs promoted team.         
	The Northern Irishman withdrew from the midweek friendly against Israel with an ankle injury, deepening Fergusons defensive concerns. United are already without Nemanja Vidic, Gary Neville, Rafael da Silva and Wes Brown due to injury.         
	Short Passes         
	Injury blows         
	Theo Walcott will miss Arsenals first Premier League match of the season against Everton on Saturday, after Arsene Wengers young squad suffered a triple injury blow. As well as Walcott, who has a back injury, defender Johan Djourou was on Thursday ruled out for a month with a knee problem while reserve goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski will be unavailable for two months after undergoing surgery on a cartilage injury.         
	Allaying fears         
	Liverpools 20 million signing, Alberto Aquilani, has moved to allay fears his career in England will be ravaged by injuries. He insists the ankle trouble which will prevent him from playing until October is not serious and may have been caused by the failings of former club Romas medical staff.         
	Torres contract         
	Fernando Torres has signed his new four-year contract with Liverpool. The Spain striker had agreed to the new deal in May but departed for the Confederations Cup in South Africa without having signed it.         
	One-month deal         
	Nigeria striker Nwankwo Kanu has signed a new one-month contract to stay at Portsmouth. Kanu was out of contract after scoring just twice last season but may now have the chance to earn a longer deal with the Premier League club.         
	Ribery alert         
	Franck Ribery has put Chelsea and Manchester United on full alert after signalling that he is ready to force a departure from Bayern Munich. The France forward is also attracting interest from Inter Milan, Barcelona and Real Madrid. Interest in Ribery cooled earlier in the summer after Chelsea and United were informed that the asking price was 60 million.

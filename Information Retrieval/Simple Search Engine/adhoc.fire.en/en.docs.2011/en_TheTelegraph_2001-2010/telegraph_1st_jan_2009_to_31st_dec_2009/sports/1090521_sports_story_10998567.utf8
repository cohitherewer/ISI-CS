	Durban: The Muttiah Muralidharan-led spin department sizzled in the tricky Kingsmead conditions as the Chennai Super Kings beat the Kings XI Punjab by 24 runs in a low-scoring Indian Premier League match here on Wednesday.         
	The Yuvraj Singh-led Kings XI would have to wait for Thursdays matches to know their fate.         
	Muralidharan (two for eight), R. Ashwin (two for 13) and Suresh Raina (two for 17) spun their web around the Kings XI batsmen and saved the day for the Super Kings as the Kings XI found runs hard to come by in the low and slow conditions. The Punjab side could only manage 92 for eight in their allotted 20 overs.         
	Left-arm pacer Thilan Thushara, playing his first match of the tournament, also picked up two wickets for 28 runs.         
	With this win, Chennai became the second team after the Delhi DareDevils to secure a semi-final berth with 17 points from 14 matches.         
	The Kings XI, with 14 points, have a slim chance (via net run-rate) to make the semis.         
	Earlier, Sreesanth and Irfan Pathan snapped two wickets each as the Kings XI Punjab restricted the formidable Super Kings to a paltry 116 for nine.         
	The Kings XIs run chase started on a disastrous note as they lost dangerous Sunny Sohal early in the second over, caught by Parthiv Patel off Thushara.         
	Simon Katich was next to depart, clean bowled behind his legs by Muralidharan, to put his team in a spot of bother at 32 for two.         
	As expected, the Kings XI batsmen found scoring tough against the Chennai spinners.         
	Muralidharan induced an edge from Luke Pomersbach (26 off 32) that Raina pounced sharply at slip to see the Sri Lankan end his spell with superb figures of 4-0-8-2. Raina then ended Yuvrajs struggle, disturbing the Punjab skippers stumps to give his side the upper hand in the contest.         
	Ashwin drived the final nail in Punjabs coffin, picking up two wickets in the 16th over. He first scalped Kumar Sangakkara with a smart catch off his own bowling and then trapped Wilkin Mota in front of the stumps.         
	Brett Lee was the next to go caught in the deep by Oram off Raina and then Irfan Pathan (14 off 12) followed in search of big hits caught by Oram of Thushara.         
	Earlier, Parthiv Patel (32 off 23 balls) and George Bailey (15) got the Super Kings off to a flying start, scoring 35 runs in the first four overs.         
	Both Patel and Bailey struck a boundary each in the second over to pick 11 runs off Irfan Pathan (two for 32).         
	It took Yuvraj Singhs magic on the field to break the dangerous partnership. (PTI)

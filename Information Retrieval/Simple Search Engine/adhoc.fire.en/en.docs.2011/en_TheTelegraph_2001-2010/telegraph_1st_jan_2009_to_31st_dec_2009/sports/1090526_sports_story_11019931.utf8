                                                   Double blow for Yuki Bhambri
            OUR CORRESPODANT                      
	Mumbai: Yuki Bhambri has pulled out of the French Open junior championships as the ankle injury he sustained while playing in an International Tennis Federation (ITF) event in Kuwait last week has not healed in time.         
	 There is no point in Yuki going to the French Open when he has been advised to rest for one more week at least, the 16-year-olds mother Indu Bhambri said from Delhi on Monday.         
	Yuki twisted his ankle during a doubles quarter final match in the $10,000 ITF Futures mens tournament in Kuwait. Although the pairing of Bhambri and Rohan Gajjar won the match, the partnership ended in the semi-finals.         
	Interestingly, the teenager would also be skipping the Wimbledon in June-July, his mother said. Instead, he would be playing in the two Futures events in Delhi, she said.

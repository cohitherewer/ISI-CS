The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karthiks 153 props up South
                                                     Karthiks 153 props up South
                  Dinesh Karthik in Bangalore on Thursday. (PTI)                     
	Bangalore: Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman failed with the bat but Team India discard Dinesh Karthik slammed a whirlwind 153 as South Zone posted 329 before being shot out by Central Zone on the opening day of the Duleep Trophy match here on Thursday.         
	In reply, Central Zone were 30 for no loss at stumps with Tanmay Srivastava (13) and Shivakant Shukla (11) in the middle and the side still 299 runs behind Souths first innings total.         
	Laxmans decision to bat first at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium boomeranged this morning and South Zone slumped to 86 for six before Karthik and M. Suresh (58 not out) propped them up to a decent score.         
	Unheralded Vidarbha pacer Umesh Yadav turned out to be the pick of the Central Zone bowlers, claiming five for 76 and his scalps included former India captain Rahul Dravid (7) and Laxman (13).         
	With the likes of Robin Uthappa (22), Dravid, Laxman and S. Badrinath (13) failing to shine with the bat, South Zone owed it to Karthik and Suresh as the side managed to cross the 300-mark before eventually folding up in 73.5 overs.         
	Karthiks blistering 153 came off just 113 balls with 24 fours and four sixes in it.         
	He put on 146 runs for the eighth wicket with Suresh, who eventually ran out of partners and remained unbeaten on 58 off 92 balls with the help of seven fours.         
	Thanks to Karthiks whirlwind knock, South Zone scored at a brisk rate of 4.45 runs per over.         
	Abhinav Mukund (13) and Uthappa gave South a sedate start this morning and added 46 runs in 12-odd overs when Pankaj Singh dealt double blows, removing both in successive overs.         
	Yadav then took the centrestage and wrecked the middle and top order with his five-wicket haul that left South Zone staring at abyss.         
	Yadav removed Dravid, Arjun Yadav (3), Laxman and R. Ashwin (23), while Bhuvneshwar Kumar too chipped in with the important wicket of Badrinath.         
	Dravid was caught when an inside-edge onto his pads lobbed up to short midwicket and Laxman played an irresponsible waft away from his body to an outswinger to be caught-behind.         
	Badrinath edged a catch to slip while reaching for a drive facing Bhuvneshwar, who impressed in the Ranji final, and soon enough South were in danger of being bowled out for under 150.         
	Gasping for breath at 144 for seven, South Zone found their saviour in Karthik who, in company of Suresh, decided to take the attack to the opposition camp and came hard after the Central bowlers.         
	Karthik scored at will and was brutal at the Central bowlers, especially Parvinder Singh.         
	Karthik executed his plans brilliantly. He went berserk in the second session as no bowler was spared the blushes.         
	He rode his luck, surviving a couple of close leg before calls and a tough chance dropped at slip by Murali Kartik. He treated spinners with disdain, using the slog-sweep against the turn with aplomb.         
	Karthik was ably supported by R Ashwin  who top-edged a pull two balls after Umesh brought in a short leg  and M Suresh.         
	Suresh was solid in defence and his innings was laced with some well-timed off drives and his most preferred shot, the cut.         
	Finally, Bhuvneshwar struck in the 59th over to remove Karthik and then Yadav castled L. Balaji to complete his five-wicket haul.         
	Karthik holed out to mid-off but not before averting an embarrassing capitulation on a pitch that eased out considerably after lunch. Balaji followed to a comical misjudgement, ducking to what he though was a bouncer, only to find his middle stump pegged back.         
	Murali Kartik dropped curtains on the innings when he trapped Sreesanth (8).         
	Brief scores         
	South Zone 329 (D. Karthik 153, M. Suresh 58; U. Yadav 5/76). Central Zone 30/0.           (AGENCIES)

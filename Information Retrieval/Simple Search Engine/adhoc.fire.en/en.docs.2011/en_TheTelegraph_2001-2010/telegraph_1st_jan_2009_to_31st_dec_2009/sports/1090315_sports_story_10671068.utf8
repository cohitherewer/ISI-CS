            STAR RACER                                              Trainer Daniel David with Diabolical (A.Imran-up)      
	Calcutta: Trainer Daniel Davids Diabolical foiled all designs of the opposition on his way to an easy victory in the 2,000m Indian Champion Cup, the chief attraction in Saturdays race card. The half-money favourite won the race almost from the start, in spite of Arturos vain attempt to upset the rhythm of the Indian Derby winner while they galloped in close attendance till about the final turn. Arturos exit from the scene brought Echoes Of Light into the fray, prompting jockey A. Imran Khan to release brakes on the favourite. The second favourite, Regal Connection, finished third.          
	Earlier, the Daniel-Khan combo had claimed the Acorn Stakes when Cascades had an easy measure of Pesi Shroffs Terrazas. Pesi, however, ended the day with a popular double, scored through Rommel and Lil Miss Sunshine in their respective events.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A point is welcome, says Bhowmick
                                                   A point is welcome, says Bhowmick
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Pune: East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick said he was happy that his team got away with a draw in their I-League opener against Pune FC Saturday.         
	Surely. Beggars cant be choosers. With the team going through a difficult phase, one point from an away match is welcome, Bhowmick sounded relieved.         
	Bhowmick said bringing Rennedy Singh on as a substitute was part of his strategy and tactics.         
	I wanted to see their foreign players I brought on Rennedy when the right time arrived, he said. We were keen on counter attack. Our defence also showed improvement from previous matches. They had only one shot from open play, others were dead ball situations.         
	Bhowmick, and captain Syed Rahim Nabi, were unhappy with the ground.         
	Touchwood, no player from either team suffered an injury. There could have been dislocation of shoulders or other injuries, the coach said.         
	Bhowmicks counterpart Derrick Pereira was more cheerful. It was an excellent show. We should have won but the players really fought it out, it was an historic day for us, Pereira said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | English psychologist helps Proteas lose chokers tag
                                                     English psychologist helps Proteas lose chokers tag

	Melbourne: Englishman Jeremy Snape helped South Africa find the mental strength to topple the Australians.         
	The South Africans were once the most renowned chokers in the game, but the recruitment of Snape as their sports psychologist and performance coach played a part in changing that.         
	Since joining Northamptonshire as a 19-year-old, Snape has developed one of the more varied CVs in English cricket.         
	He played 10 one-day Internationals, spent a brief term as Englands slow-bowling coach, and then set up a company  Sporting Edge  who study management styles in footballs Premier League and crickets County Championship. The results have informed South Africas clinical gameplan.         
	There is definitely a blueprint for how to run a successful team, Snape says.         
	When I speak to a player  Morne Morkel, say  I tell him that he is the managing director of Morne Morkel Ltd, and that everything he does, whether it be training, nutrition, or mental preparation, will affect his share price.         
	It is just a way of encouraging the player to take responsibility. Sometimes you see teams  and one suspects that he is talking about England here  That have a huge amount of hierarchy. There are chairmen, managing directors, coaches, assistant coaches... and by the time you get to the players, they feel that they are at the bottom of the pyramid.         
	One of the themes of South Africas successful year has been their watertight shot-selection. Time and again, their opponents have gone down with all guns blazing, only to see Graeme Smith and his men occupy the crease for session after session.         
	According to Snape, this discipline comes from mental preparation. He says that too many teams spend long hours working on the details of technique when 80 per cent of the game is played in the mind.         
	In cricket we normally look at the highlights, which start as the bowler is halfway through his run-up and finish when the batsman plays a shot. What is more important for me is the lowlights: the five seconds before the delivery is bowled. Its the thinking in the intervals between deliveries that counts.         
	If that thinking is out of kilter you can have the best technique in the world, and it wont help. If your strategy is wrong, if youve allowed the last ball or the last phase of play to contaminate your next shot, youve lost before youve started. And yet most players focus on techniques to make the highlights better.         
	Snapes concentration drills may be frowned upon by old-school players, but they have clearly helped South Africa.         
	Most teams would have crumbled when facing a fourth-innings target of 413 in Perth, or the likelihood of a huge deficit in Melbourne. Not this one. They got their heads down and fought their way to a pair of historic victories.         
	There is plenty of pedigree in their coaching set-up, which is led by Mickey Arthur and also features Duncan Fletcher in a consultancy role. This may explain why the customised fields that Smith set for each Australian batsman had such a flavour of the 2005 Ashes about them.         
	There is a lesson here for England, whose tactics have lacked a certain focus this year.         
	If Australia are to be beaten, the coaching staff must come up with a way of muzzling senior players such as Ricky Ponting. They could do worse than to start by asking Snape his advice.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No bold predictions this time as Aussies depart
                                                     No bold predictions this time as Aussies depart
                  Brett Lee                     
	Brisbane: There were no bold 5-0 predictions from Glenn McGrath before the first batch of the Australian squad jetted off to England on Wednesday ahead of the Ashes series.         
	In fact, there was no McGrath. Or Shane Warne. Or Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden, Justin Langer, Damien Martyn or Jason Gillespie.         
	Four years ago, an experienced and confident squad departed for England predicting that whitewash, but suffered a 1-2 series loss.         
	They largely stayed together to avenge that defeat with a 5-0 Ashes series win at home in 2006-07. Then the retirements started.         
	Skipper Ricky Ponting, who was the first captain since Allan Border in 1986-87 to taste Ashes defeat when he led the 2005 tour, is one of only five survivors of that trip.         
	Among the other survivors are vice-captain Michael Clarke, opener Simon Katich, Brad Haddin now first-choice wicketkeeper but a non-playing backup in 2005  and pacer Brett Lee.         
	It still sits inside me that I was part of that tour, Haddin said recently. And knowing how the guys felt coming back to Australia, I know they were upset and embarrassed. We were caught on the hop a bit but you can be sure that wont happen this time.         
	The squad for the World Twenty20 left Wednesday for England to try to win the only major international trophy the Australians havent won in recent seasons.         
	The remainder will head over in the coming weeks for tour matches at the Hove and Worcester ahead of the first Test starting July 8 in Cardiff.         
	At the corresponding time four years ago McGrath famously predicted a sweep of the Ashes when he attended the pre-tour camp in Coolum.         
	That came back to bite him, hard.         
	At Coolum this week, there was no boasting about victory margins.         
	There was no bowler with the experience and pedigree of McGrath, who retired with more wickets than any other pacer.         
	Instead, the attention was focused on the competition for fast bowling spots, the attendance of wives and girlfriends (WAGS) at the camp and on the tour and the decision by selectors to overlook allrounder Andrew Symonds, who will play in the World Twenty20 but not the Ashes.         
	Australia won the series-opening match at Lords in 2005, with McGrath voted Man of the Match.         
	But Australias dominance faded quickly after McGrath was sidelined for the second and third matches after twisting his ankle in a warm-up little more than an hour before the second Test was to start.

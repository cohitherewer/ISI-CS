The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Delhi DareDevils start favourites
                                                   Delhi DareDevils start favourites
                      
	Cape Town: A battle of guile between some big hitters of the game and experienced bowlers is on the cards when Delhi DareDevils and Kings XI Punjab cross swords in their opening encounter of the Indian Premier League, here on Sunday.         
	The DareDevils, the title favourites, boast off a balanced side with in-form batsmen and experienced bowlers in their ranks though the result can go either way as both the sides will be rusty in their first matches at the Newlands.         
	The Delhi franchisee have an explosive batting line-up with the likes of captain Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, David Warner and South African AB de Villiers in pink of form, while Glenn McGrath and Daniel Vettori will lead the bowling department.         
	Australian Dirk Nannes, the Twenty20 specialist though is not certain whether he would play on Sunday as only four foreigners are allowed in the playing XI.         
	Young Umesh Yadav, who tormented the Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman in the Duleep Trophy, is also likely to be thrown into the ring by Sehwag to prove his spell against the India biggies was not a flash in the pan.         
	Kings XI Punjab are no less formidable in batting with Sri Lankans Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawradene besides captain Yuvraj Singh. They will, however, miss Australians Shaun Marsh and James Hopes.         
	The Achilles heel for Kings XI Punjab is in the bowling department. With the absence of Brett Lee, Jerome Taylor and Sreesanth, the onus will be on Irfan Pathan and Piyush Chawla to deliver. England all-rounder Ravi Bopara could come in handy for Yuvraj.         
	On the other hand, the DareDevils have the experienced Glenn McGrath, who defied age in the last edition, and justified his pigeon status and he should also come good this time also with his rich experience in South Africa.         
	Sehwag also has spin options in Daniel Vettori and Amit Mishra though it is to be seen whether he will go for two spinners on a hard and bouncy Newlands pitch. (PTI)

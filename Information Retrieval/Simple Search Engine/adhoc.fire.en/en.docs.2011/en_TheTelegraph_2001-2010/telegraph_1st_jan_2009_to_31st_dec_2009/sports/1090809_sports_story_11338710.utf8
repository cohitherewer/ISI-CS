The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Botham bats for the fans
                                                     Botham bats for the fans
                              
	Leeds: Legendary England all-rounder Saturday took a strong exception to the England Cricket Board (ECB)s idea of stifling Barmy Armys expression against the Australian team and said it was like telling Indian fans not to exult on Sachin Tendulkars boundaries.         
	Botham said fans support or banter is what is called the home advantage, without which the stadiums would have a sterile atmosphere.         
	Theres been a lot of chat about fans getting stuck into the Aussies in the Test matches  its called home advantage, Botham wrote in his newspaper column.         
	What do people expect from the crowd? They are England fans and it is fair to expect them to be with the home team and against the away team. Thats the same everywhere around the world.         
	Each crowd has its own way of going about it.         
	Telling the England fans to keep a lid on their songs and banter is like telling the Indian fans to keep it quiet when Sachin Tendulkar walks out to bat or hits a boundary, he said.         
	ECB has advised the Barmy Army to refrain from booing the Australians, especially their captain Ricky Ponting, who was targeted at Edgbaston during the third Ashes Test.         
	What you dont want is a sterile atmosphere.         
	Who wants to see it go too far the other way and have a ground with no atmosphere? It would be like playing football behind closed doors  rubbish, said Botham.         
	The former England player did not feel fans were erring in the ongoing Ashes and that Ponting was bothered by the Edgbaston crowd.         
	Ricky Ponting couldnt care one iota whether some fan gives him a boo when he goes out to bat, youll find hes got much more on his plate to worry about than that.         
	The booing isnt a massive issue because I dont think it is malicious.         
	Ponting is one of the greats and it could well be the last time any of us get to see him bat on our shores and that is something to bear in mind.         
	If it got to be serious abuse, then thats not something to tolerate, but I dont think there has been much wrong at all this summer, he remarked.         
	By and large, the fans are well behaved and they should be applauded for supporting the side as well as they do. The fans are there to enjoy themselves.         
	They pay their money to go and watch the cricket and with that, comes a bit of banter, which makes for a cracking atmosphere, he added.

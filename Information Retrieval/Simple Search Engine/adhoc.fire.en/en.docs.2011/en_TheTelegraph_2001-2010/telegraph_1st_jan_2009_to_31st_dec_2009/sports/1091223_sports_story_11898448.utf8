	Silchar: A lacklustre East Bengal, playing without Bhaichung Bhutia, were held to a goalless draw by lowly Viva Kerala in their opening match of the Federation Cup, here on Tuesday.         
	East Bengal, coached by Belgian Phillippe de Ridder, were the clear favourites over the Kerala side who were languishing at the bottom of I-League table but the Kolkata giants produced a disappointing show at the Satindra Mohan Dev Memorial Stadium in the Group A match.         
	Except for a fine effort by Yusif Yakubu, whose free-kick in the 22nd minute hit the woodwork, East Bengal did not get a clear chance throughout the match.         
	The Kerala side had better ball possession in the first half but they lacked the creativity to breach the rival defence.         
	Viva Kerala got quite a few free-kicks in the first session from dangerous spots and East Bengal defence led by Nirmal Chhetri had to clear a lot of them for corners.         
	From one such set pieces in the 30th minute, T Karma took a shot which had the power but lacked in accuracy as it went way wide of the East Bengal goal.         
	In the 43rd minute, Yakubu got into action for East Bengal when his free kick from the edge of the box went over the bar.         
	Just at the stroke of half-time, East Bengal got another opportunity to strike first blood as Alvitos corner wasnt cleared properly.         
	Subhas Singhs attempt was blocked by VV Surjith.         
	 In a later match, Salgaocar defeated JCT 1-0. Mandjou Keita scored the all-important goal in the 14th minute. (Agencies)

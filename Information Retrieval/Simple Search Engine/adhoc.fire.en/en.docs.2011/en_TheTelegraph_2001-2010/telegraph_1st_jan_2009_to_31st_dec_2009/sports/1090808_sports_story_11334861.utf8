	Akron (US): Irelands Padraig Harrington spectacularly rolled in three successive putts from more than 20 feet to grab a two-shot lead in Thursdays opening round at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational.         
	However, returning from an injury break, Jeev Milkha Singh carded a modest even-par 70 to take a share of the 27th spot alongside defending champion Vijai Singh and World No. 2 Phil Mickelson.         
	Jeev, playing his first tournament after being laid low by a rib injury for three weeks, sank in three birdies against an equal number of bogeys.         
	Competing in his first tournament since the British Open three weeks ago, Harrington fired a flawless six-under-par 64 at the Firestone Country Club.         
	Having teed off at the 10th, Harrington did well to save par at the sixth by rolling in a 21-footer before adding birdie putts from 26 and 23 feet at the seventh and eighth.         
	He then parred the ninth to end the day two ahead of Thailands Prayad Marksaeng, American Scott Verplank and South African Tim Clark in the elite World Golf Championships (WGC) event.         
	Americans Steve Stricker and Zach Johnson and Britains Ian Poulter opened with matching 67s while World No. 1 Tiger Woods, bidding for a record seventh title at Firestone, carded a 68.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rest the best as rain spoils day
                                                   Rest the best as rain spoils day
                      
	Nagpur: Rest of India (RoI) clinched their fourth successive Irani Cup, defeating Mumbai on the basis of first innings lead, after the fifth and final day of the match was called off due to a wet outfield here Monday.         
	Although there was no rain since morning, overnight showers rendered the outfield unplayable and after five inspections, the on-field umpires finally decided to abandon days proceedings without a ball being bowled.         
	Riding Ravindra Jadejas 77, RoI made 260 runs in their first innings and then bowled out Mumbai for 230 to take, in what proved to be, a match-winning 30-run lead.         
	In their second essay, the Virender Sehwag-led side were cruising at 352 for four after rain curtailed fourth days play Sunday with Manoj Tiwary unbeaten on 80 off 132 balls and wicket-keeper batsman Wriddhiman Saha on five.         
	For RoI, Abhinav Mukund (126 off 250 balls), Murali Vijay (91 off 211) and Manoj starred with the bat in the second innings.         
	Burly off-spinner Romesh Powar and left-arm orthodox Iqbal Abdullah were the key wicket-takers for Mumbai, picking up two apiece, giving away 96 and 78 runs respectively.         
	Earlier, skipper Wasim Jaffer (68) and Ajinkya Rahane (44) did put up some resistance as the pace duo of Sreesanth (3/46) and Munaf Patel (5/70) wreaked havoc with the new ball to restrict Mumbai to 230.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australia banking on return of all-rounders
                                                   Australia banking on return of all-rounders
                            
	Dubai: Australia are banking on the return of Andrew Symonds and Shane Watson to provide the spark for a jaded side which takes on Pakistan in the first of five one-day Internationals on Wednesday.         
	The two powerful all-rounders should lift the Australians who are resting captain Ricky Ponting, batsman Mike Hussey and fast bowler Mitchell Johnson for the series against Pakistan which has been moved to the UAE because of security concerns.         
	Many people talk about our back-to-back series with South Africa but we have been on the road since the Indian Test series and thats about 200 days, Australia coach Tim Nielsen told reporters on Tuesday.         
	In the absence of Hussey and Ponting we have a couple of batsmen down the order and we will have to look at the conditions and try and put together the best 11 players, he said.         
	Players like Andrew, Shane and Shaun Marsh will add strength and energy to the squad, added Nielsen.         
	We havent played Pakistan a lot over a period but we have had some real ding-dong battles in the past.         
	Stand-in skipper Michael Clarke was also looking forward to the return of fast bowler Brett Lee, who is scheduled to be fit for the third match of the series.         
	He is a wonderful player, but what we have seen over the past six to eight months that we can still be successful without Brett, Clarke said.           (REUTERS)

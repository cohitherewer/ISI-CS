The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lucky Jim ends drought
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lucky Jim ends drought
                      
	Thousand Oaks (US): Jim Furyk ended a 29-month title drought when he clinched the Chevron World Challenge by one stroke over Britains Graeme McDowell on Sunday.         
	Furyk, who had played 54 worldwide events since his last win in 2007, shot a final-round 67 at Sherwood Country Club to finish 13-under par on 275 and take the $1.35 million winners cheque.         
	McDowell, who was a late invite after world No.1 Tigers Woods pulled out, finished second at 12-under after a final-round 70 and earned an invitation to next years Masters tournament at Augusta National.         
	European Order of Merit winner Lee Westwood finished tied with Irelands Padraig Harrington for third after he three-putted the final hole despite a late run over the closing holes had put him into contention. It has bothered me that I havent won, I would be lying to say otherwise, Furyk said.         
	Furyk began the day two strokes behind third round co-leaders South Korean Yang Yong-eun and McDowell and was only one-under for the day as he turned for home.         
	Yang, who was suffering with the flu all week and considered pulling out, and McDowell also struggled on the front nine, with Yang shooting a three-over 37 while McDowell was one over.         
	Furyk took the lead after a birdie on the 10th hole and kept at least a share throughout the final nine holes.         
	You have to get a little lucky to win golf tournaments, Furyk said. I hit a poor tee shot and put myself in the bunker. I got lucky on the putt and you need those if you are going to win.

  -   India reduce hosts to 167/4 after setting 617-run target         A CORRESPONDENT            Rahul Dravid at the end of the fourth days play in Wellington on Monday. (AFP)                                 
	Wellington: Indias middle-order batsman Yuvraj Singh defended the teams decision to delay the declaration in the second innings. The Indians declared their second innings at 434 for seven, adding 85 quick runs to their overnight tally.         
	Set a near impossible target of 617, hosts New Zealand were struggling at 167 for four before bad light brought an early end to the fourth days play. The visitors lead 1-0 lead in the three-Test series.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Why did India continue to bat on Monday?         
	Our strategy was to put as many runs on the board as quickly as possible and declare and have enough time to win the game.         
	If India are confident of a win on Tuesday         
	You can always have thoughts about it, but you have to bowl well throughout the day to get ten wickets. The wicket becomes a little slow suddenly The batsmen are set and can get runs. You have to work hard to get those last six wickets.         
	The forecast of rain         
	We heard its going to rain. We wanted to declare quickly and get 600 runs on the board so we could have enough overs to bowl at New Zealand. Rain is always predicted. Sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesnt. Fingers crossed we should get enough overs tomorrow.         
	If India were right in having eight fielders on the off-side         
	You got to ask the captain. When you start going for runs, you try and contain the batsmen for a little while Try and make him play to our strength, so maybe we were trying that. But Im sure our tactics are going to change tomorrow morning.         
	Rahul Dravids record of highest number of catches in Tests         
	(He) Took a great catch to equal the world record and took another one to be the highest so its a great feeling for him. Hes been there for more than 13 years He has been outstanding as batsman and in the slips cordon. So congratulations to him from the boys. We advised him to keep the ball. Its a big achievement.

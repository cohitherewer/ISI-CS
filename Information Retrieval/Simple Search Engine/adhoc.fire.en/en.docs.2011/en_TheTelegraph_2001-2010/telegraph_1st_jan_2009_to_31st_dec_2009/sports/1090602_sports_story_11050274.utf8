            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former East Bengal coach Stanley Rozario was roped in by newly-promoted I-League club, Lajong FC of Shillong as the chief coach for the coming season. Rozario has agreed a one-year deal with the Shillong club.         
	This is a new team with a lot of potential. They have a lot of talent and are very hardworking. Lajong FC have been the torch-bearers for popularising football in the Northeast, said the Goan while speaking to The Telegraph from Shillong on Monday.         
	Its a big platform for the footballers from these parts. Its a challenging assignment and so I have taken up the job, Rozario added.         
	We already have three foreigners, including Daniel from Chirag United, Rozario said. I am going to Chennai tomorrow to watch the Santosh Trophy matches. We may sign a few promising players there, he said.         
	Rozario coached Goas Salgaocar of Goa in the later half of the last season and helped them advance to the premier division I-League.         
	Meanwhile, Goas Vasco Sports Club has signed former Oil India coach Subrata Bhattacharya as the chief coach.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pakistans Bangla tour cancelled
                                                   Pakistans Bangla tour cancelled
                      
	Karachi: The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) informed the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Wednesday that they cannot host the Pakistan team because of security issues in their country as their government had not given clearance for the series of five one-dayers and two Twenty20 matches.         
	After the cancellation of the tour, former PCB chairman Lt General (retd.) Tauqir Zia alleged that India influenced Bangladesh to cancel the series. I cant say for certain if someone has influenced them but yes there is no doubt that India has been working on a policy of undermining and isolating Pakistan since the Mumbai attacks, he said.

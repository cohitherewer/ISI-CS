The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India, Pak to meet in semis
                                                                                                                       7                                      India, Pak to meet in semis
                      
	Salta: India spanked Belgium 4-2 in their final preliminary match to top group A and set up a semi-final clash with archrivals Pakistan in the Champions Challenge I hockey tournament.         
	Pakistan beat South Africa 4-1 to finish second in group B.         
	It was a spirited beginning to Thursdays match with chances going a begging at both ends, including a penalty-corner that India shot wide.         
	Although the Belgian defence held tight, India controlled most of the play with Shivendra Singh and Prabhjot Singh active upfront.         
	Prabhjot had a great opportunity to open the scoring after stealing the ball from Xavier Reckinger in deep defence but his shot was just wide.         
	India, who needed just a draw to make the semis, finally struck from a penalty-corner in the 19th minute, with a low flick by Dhananjay Mahadik.         
	A few minutes later another penalty-corner but the Indians failed to double their tally as the initial shot was saved and Rajpal could not convert the rebound.         
	Belgium reacted well and after wasting a penalty-corner, equalised from a penalty-stroke by Jerome Dekeyser in the 24th minute. Less than a minute later, a field goal by Renaud Pangrazio helped them go ahead of India.         
	The end of the first-half was dominated by India with a goal by Shivendra in the 30th minute to restore parity.         
	India missed a chance to break the deadlock early in the second-half when they yet again failed to make a penalty-corner count. With the stalemate continuing, both teams kept going hammer and tongs at each other, making for a thrilling display of hockey.         
	Tushar Khandekar put India ahead in the 48th minute but the Belgians were in no mood to surrender and Adrian DSouza had to pull a spectacular diving save to protect Indias lead.         
	That was how it was till the final whistle with the Belgians going all out for the equaliser. A last-gasp goal by Prabhjot, however, put paid to Belgian hopes.         
	With the win, India top pool A ahead of New Zealand, Belgium and China. After rest day Friday, India play Pakistan in the semis Saturday.           (PTI)

                                                   Anjum, Priyanka star in India win
                      
	Taunton: Leg-spinner Priyanka Roys five-wicket haul and Anjum Chopras gutsy unbeaten 37 off 52 balls helped India bounce back into contention as they defeated arch-rivals Pakistan by five wickets in a Womens Twenty20 World Cup Pool B match here on Saturday.         
	India skittled out Pakistan for 75 in 19.5 overs thanks to Roys clinical display (5/16) and pace-woman Rumeli Dhar (3/13).         
	Chasing the target, India got off to a disastrous start as they lost three wickets in the first five overs, but Chopra who cracked five fours, cashed in on her experience to help her team romp home.         
	Earlier, electing to bat, the Pakistan batting line-up failed to negotiate the clinical performance by Indian bowlers.         
	The three batters  opener Nain Abidi (17), Asmavia Iqbal (10) along with Almas Akram (12)  managed reaching double digit scores.         
	Dhar, who extracted some fine bounces and lateral movements from the pitch, dealt the first blow by removing left-hand opener Bismah Maroof (6) and then sent back Sajjida Shah for a duck.

                                                   Was fun to beat their full side: Okolie Odafe
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Okolie Odafe was on cloud nine moments after the referee P.K. Bose blew the final whistle in the Durand Cup on Tuesday.         
	As Odafes teammates rushed to congratulate him, the Nigerian striker ran towards the team bench to embrace his coach Carlos Pereira. Then he looked up to the VIP arena to show a V sign to the team boss, Alemao Churchill.         
	The match was a challenge for us, Odafe said later. There was too much talk about how Mohun Bagan missed Barreto and Chidi in the IFA Shield final. Here, both played. It was fun to beat their full side, said Odafe.         
	Like some other people, I dont want to talk big before the match, a beaming Odafe said. I wanted my performance to speak. I hope no one has any doubt about who was the better team in the final, the Nigerian said.         
	First player to score a hattrick in the Durand Cup final after Ulaganathan did it in Mohun Bagans 3-2 victory over JCT in 1974-75 season, Odafe was not ready to accept it was his personal achievement.         
	Its the team effort that won the title for us, he stressed. Everyone contributed in the victory. We have a great team and are going great guns. I am sure we have a fine season ahead, he said with optimism.         
	Churchill coach Carlos Pereira said he never expected the victory could be so easy. But then, we could have won it in the regulation period itself, he commented.         
	Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa felt a Churchill player committed a handball when Odafe scored his second goal.

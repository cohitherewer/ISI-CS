                                                   Angelo action tests rules
                      
	Nottingham: Improvisation by Angelo Mathews put the ICC rule book to test in the World Twenty20 Wednesday.         
	During the West Indies innings, Ramnaresh Sarwan hit one to the boundary where Mathews almost took a catch. However, when he saw that the momentum was carrying him over the ropes, he threw the ball into the air before crossing the boundary. The ball also crossed the rope but Mathews jumped up and slammed the ball back into play. The third umpire awarded three runs. It opened up a debate. According to the laws, rule 32.4.b states (b) 6 runs shall be scored if a fielder (i) has any part of his person touching, or grounded beyond, the boundary when he catches the ball. (ii) catches the ball and subsequently touches the boundary or grounds some part of his person over the boundary while carrying the ball but before completing the catch. (PTI)

	New Delhi: Saina Nehwal made a disappointing return to the court as she crashed out after an opening-round loss but P. Kashyap kept Indian hopes alive by advancing to the pre-quarter finals of the Japan Open Super Series badminton tournament in Tokyo Wednesday.         
	The only Indian in mens singles, Kashyap scored a 21-17, 12-21, 21-11 win over Japanese Takuma Ueda in a 51-minute battle.         
	World No.34 Kashyap will next take on No.3 Peter Gade of Denmark in the pre-quarter finals Thursday.         
	Saina, returning after a month-long break, lost 15-21, 23-21, 14-21 to world No.10 Yanjiao Jiang of China in a 53-minute clash.         
	The seventh seed Indian mixed doubles pair of Jwala Gutta and V. Diju too crashed out of the tournament with an 18-21, 12-21 loss against Thai pair Sudket Prapakamol and Saralee Thungthongkam.         
	Jwala had more disappointment in store as she and Ashwini Ponnappa were beaten 15-21, 21-19, 18-21 by seventh seed Japanese team of Miyuki Maeda and Satoko Suetsuna in the womens doubles opener.

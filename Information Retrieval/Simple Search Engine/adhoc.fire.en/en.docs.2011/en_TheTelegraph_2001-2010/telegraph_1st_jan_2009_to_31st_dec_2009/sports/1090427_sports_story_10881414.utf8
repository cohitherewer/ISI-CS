                                                   Australians not worried
                      
	Mildura: Australian tennis officials are confident of avoiding a 12-month ban or relegation for boycotting a Davis Cup match in India on security grounds. The International Tennis Federation said it would consider the sanctions on Australia for refusing to travel for the May 8-10 match at Chennai in due course.         
	India were awarded the win on forfeit and will advance to the World Group playoffs. Australia face penalties ranging up to a 12-month suspension from Davis Cup, a fine of $100,000 or relegation to Asia-Oceania Group II. Tennis Australia (TA) president Geoff Pollard on Sunday said he was expecting a penalty of about $25,000.

	Farmingdale: Play was suspended at the rain-lashed US Open on Thursday because of too much water on the greens, virtually ensuring the first round would spill over into Friday.         
	Although squeegees were being used on every green at Bethpage Black, organisers decided to call a halt at 1015 local time (1415 GMT) with only half the field of 156 out on the course.         
	Little-known American Jeff Brehaut led at one under par after 11 holes, level with Swede Johan Edfors (four holes), Canadian Andrew Parr (three) and American Ryan Spears (three).         
	Holder Tiger Woods, the heavy favourite this week in pursuit of his 15th major title, was one over after six holes.         
	Persistent rain over the last six weeks had saturated the hilly 7,426-yard layout and further showers and thunderstorms have been forecast on Long Island for the next four days.         
	The volume of rainfall was outpacing our ability to squeegee the greens, chairman of the championship committee Jim Hyler told reporters.         
	That was the bottom line. The greens became unplayable and we just needed to suspend.         
	Based on local weather forecasts, Hyler was optimistic the rain would ease considerably by afternoon.         
	We may still get some showers for a little bit beyond that but were hopeful well get a window of maybe three to five hours this afternoon where we can play golf, he said. We can then get a lot done.         
	Although Fridays forecast was much more promising, Hyler said there was little chance of completing the second round before Saturday.         
	If we lose half a day today (Thursday) it would be impossible to catch up tomorrow so we may be looking at Saturday morning to get the second round finished, get the cut and go from there, he added.         
	Hyler said the tees had been brought forward on the seventh, ninth, 10th and 12th holes for the opening round to give the players some relief on the sixth longest layout to stage a major championship.         
	Seven of the par-four holes are in excess of 450 yards with three of them measuring more than 500.         
	Although the tight fairways are flanked by graduated rough, extensive rain in recent weeks has left the tangly grass wet, making it difficult for players to escape without penalty.         
	Five or six yards off the fairway is where the heavy stuff starts and thats really bad, said 2006 champion Geoff Ogilvy of Australia. (REUTERS)

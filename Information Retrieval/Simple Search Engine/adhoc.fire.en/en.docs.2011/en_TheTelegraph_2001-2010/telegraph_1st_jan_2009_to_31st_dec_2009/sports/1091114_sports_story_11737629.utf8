	Hong Kong: At tied 12th, SSP Chowrasia (69) remained the highest-placed Indian but it was Jeev Milkha Singh who brought home the best card among his compatriots  a three-under 67  in the second round of the Hong Kong Open golf tournament here Friday.         
	Chowrasia was six-under 134 overall after picking up two birdies against a lone bogey at the Hong Kong Golf course. Jeev, meanwhile, stroked in five birdies against a couple of bogeys to leapfrog 40 places to tied 54th with a total of two-under 138.         
	Jyoti Randhawa was a stroke adrift of Chowrasia after he too turned in a 69 to go down six places to tied 22nd.         
	A mid-round slump also prevented Shiv Kapur from building on a good start as he carded a second successive two-under 68.         
	Rahil Gangjee turned in an even-par card to be three-under overall at tied 43rd.         
	Overnight tied 16th with an opening round of 66, Gaganjeet Bhullar had a tough day as he only found bogeys, stumbling to four for a card of four-over 74 that left him tied 83rd with a total of even-par 140.         
	Gaurav Ghei (74) and Anirban Lahiri (72) were tied 110th with a total of three-over 143.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tailenders resist UP onslaught
                                                   Tailenders resist UP onslaught
                      
	Nagpur: Uttar Pradesh (UP) bowlers made a resilient comeback with fine spells but Tamil Nadus tail, led by C. Ganapathy, who scored 67, wagged to keep their team ahead on the second day of the Ranji Trophy super league semi-final match Monday.         
	Ganapathys rearguard action gave Tamil Nadu 445 in the first innings. He then struck with the ball to remove opener Tanmay Srivastava and leave UP at 25 for one at stumps.         
	While TN batsmen dominated the first day it was the UP bowlers turn on the second day with Praveen Kumar, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Imtiyaz Ahmed putting in commendable efforts.         
	However, Ganapathy had other ideas. He found support in the tail and they started with caution. Although he remained stranded on his career-best score when last man P. Amarnath was run out, he had useful partnerships of 30 and 48 with Laxmipathy Balaji and C. Suresh respectively.         
	UPs Shivakant Shukla and Suresh Raina survived the remaining 15.5 overs in the day.         
	Brief scores: Tamil Nadu 445 (A. Mukund 100, D. Karthik 72; P. Kumar 3/104). UP 25/1. Match to continue. (UNI)

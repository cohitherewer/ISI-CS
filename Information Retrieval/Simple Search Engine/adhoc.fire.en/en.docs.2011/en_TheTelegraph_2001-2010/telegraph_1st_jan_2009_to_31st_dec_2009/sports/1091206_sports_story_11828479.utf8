	Calcutta: Prince Bajaj and Samrat Ghorai sit pretty with six points apiece at the top after the sixth round of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship, being presented by Himani Sona Chandi Chawyanprash and organised by Alekhine Chess Club, at Gorky Sadan on Saturday.         
	Bajaj of DPS, Gaziabad won both his games with lan in identical fashion to reach the top.         
	He made short work of Saurabh Mandal of Jharkhand in 25 moves, and later in the evening, decimated Risav Mitra of Dum Dum Baidyanath Institute with the black pieces.         
	Ghorai of Dishari Public School stole the show on the day upsetting top seed Sayantan Das of Scottish Church Collegiate School in an interesting encounter.         
	Ghorai held the upperhand throughout the game and thwarted his opponents attempts to squeeze out a victory.         
	In the 5th round he had beaten Ardhya Sekhar Bagchi of Calcutta Boys School. Seeded 10th, Ghorai meets Bajaj, in a crucial 7th round tie.         
	Second seed Satyajit Kundu of Vivekananda Mission School crushed the French defence of Chandrasish Majumdar of St Xaviers. The latter mishandled the opening giving Satyajit a strong attack on the kingside.

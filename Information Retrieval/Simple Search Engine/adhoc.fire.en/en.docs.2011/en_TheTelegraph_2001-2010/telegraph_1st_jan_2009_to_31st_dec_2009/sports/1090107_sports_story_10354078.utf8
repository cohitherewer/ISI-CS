The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Somdev makes solid start
                                                   Somdev makes solid start
                      
	Chennai: Somdev Dev Varman began the new season on a winning note, carving out a straight set win over world No. 114 Kevin Kim to make the second round even as Rohan Bopanna was knocked of $450,000 ATP Chennai Open Tuesday.         
	Somdev, ranked 202 in ATP ranking list, beat his American opponent 6-3, 6-3 quite comfortably in his opening round match of the hardcourt event.         
	However, the road for the numero uno singles player of the country will get tough from here as he will take on sixth seed Spaniard Carlos Moya in the next round.         
	Bopanna  second highest-ranked Indian player at 332  went down fighting against Uzbekistans Denis Istomin 4-6, 6-7 (3-7) in his first round.         
	Bopanna, who had entered the main draw as a qualifier put up a spirited fight but could not repeat the success of the qualifying event against world No. 109.         
	World No. 5 Nikolay Davydenko packed off Austrian Daniel Koellerer 6-2, 6-3 in the first round on Tuesday.         
	Swiss second seed Stanislas Wawrinka lost 6-4, 6-1 to Italian qualifier Flavio Cipolla. World No. 138 Cipolla won in 95 minutes against the error-prone Swiss, who is ranked 16th in the world.         
	Fourth seed Croatian Ivo Karlovic pounded 10 aces to dismantle qualifier Rajeev Ram of the United States 6-4, 6-3 to make a winning start to the new season.         
	Davydenko wrapped up the match in 72 minutes on centre court to make a winning start to his preparations for the Australian Open in Melbourne later this month.         
	The 27-year-old Davydenko won the opening set with breaks in the sixth and eighth games.         
	But the energetic Koellerer, ranked 123rd in the world, put up a late resistance in the second set and entertained the spectators with some delicate drop shots.         
	Davydenko, who finished in the top five for the fourth straight year in 2008, broke the Austrian in the eighth game and sealed the match with his eighth ace.         
	He played some good drop shots, because I need to run and try and do something. He played very well this game, Davydenko said.         
	Somdev, backed by his friends and former neighbours from the Income Tax Quarters  where he lived till 2005  just about a kilometre from the stadium, overran the American without much sweat in 75 minutes.         
	I wanted to start the season on a positive note. It is also a great feeling playing before the home crowd. For years, I had watched top tennis stars play on at this stadium and it is an unbelievable feeling now that I had played before the same crowd, Somdev said after the match.         
	All my friends who had studied with me and played with me were watching the game today. I was little more comfortable in the second set and was able to serve better, he said.         
	Regardless of who I meet next, I am going to step up my game and play positive tennis, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gary contract likely to be extended
                                                     Gary contract likely to be extended
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI    
	Bangalore: Gary Kirstens contract is likely to be extended by a year, allowing him to continue as the Team India coach till the 2011 World Cup.         
	As of now, the South Africans two-year contract ends next March.         
	The matter hasnt been discussed as yet, thats because theres quite a bit of time between now and the end of Kirstens contract. However, for reasons of continuity at least, I dont see why he wont be asked to continue till the World Cup, a senior Board official told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Saturday, he added: Therell be less than a year for the World Cup when Kirstens existing contract ends and, with so little time then, it wouldnt be prudent to effect a change... Also, dont forget that the last time, it took us 11 months (from April 2007, when Greg Chappell departed) to get a full-fledged coach...         
	Indeed, changing horses, so to say, at such a late stage, just wont do anybody any good.

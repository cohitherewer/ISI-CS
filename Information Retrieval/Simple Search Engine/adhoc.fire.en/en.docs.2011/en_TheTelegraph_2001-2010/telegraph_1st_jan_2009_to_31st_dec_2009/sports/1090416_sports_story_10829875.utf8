The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | First title beckons Churchill Brothers
                                                   First title beckons Churchill Brothers

	Margao: The air of optimism and anticipation is unmistakable in the Churchill Brothers camp. The buzz is so strong that one can almost touch it.         
	Ciabro Alemao, the club secretary, is throwing a party on the eve of the match against Mohammedan Sporting. Sure, upsets can never be ruled out in sport, but given the domineering form they are in, who could fault Churchill for putting the champagne on ice in advance?         
	Churchill, level on points with Mohun Bagan, have their task cut out in Thursdays final round clash at the Fatorda stadium: win the match, win the title. Their superior goal difference of +26, as against Bagans +11, will make the outcome in Delhi irrelevant.         
	It will be a family dream come true should the team from Varca win the title for the first time in their 35-year history. The only club in the league to be owned and managed by a family have finished runners-up on four occasions, the latest being last season when they finished tied on points with local rivals Dempo but lost out on goal difference.         
	Determined not to allow a repeat of last years misfortune, the team made it a point to stay ahead of others in terms of goal difference right from the start of this season. And thanks to the prolific Nigerian Okolie Odafe, whose tally of 24 strikes is the highest for the season, they are comfortably placed in that department.         
	The team could have more or less won the title with a round to spare, had Air India not held them in the previous round in Mumbai. Having seen his players choke at the crucial juncture, coach Zoran Djordjevic has tried to keep them as relaxed as possible on the eve of the match.         
	The players had a light training session at their home ground in Varca, a few kilometres from the match venue, the tone set by a haka-like team song with Odafe and his compatriot Ogba Kalu Nnanna performing the lead.         
	In my career, the most important lesson I have learnt is to not put pressure on the players before a final, the Serbian coach said.         
	The hosts, however, would have to overcome one disadvantage  lack of match practice. Since playing out a nervous 1-1 draw at the Cooperage on March 28, Churchill have not appeared in a competitive game. It will affect us, but there will be no excuses, Djordjevic said.         
	Team manager Denzil Alemao dismissed with a smile the issue of Bagan offering Rs 5 lakh as incentive to Mohammedan Sporting if they beat Churchill. Its not good for Indian football. The AIFF should take action, he said.         
	Mohammedan Sporting, fighting to stave off relegation, would be determined not to end up playing a supporting role in Thursdays show.         
	Everybody is speaking as if we are not a football team, coach Shabbir Ali said. We have not played that badly, although we have not played that well either. We have done well with the limited resources we have. We are the only team in the league to have taken six (new) players this season. Lets see.         
	Mohammedan Sporting, who are 11th in the 12-team competition, will miss the services of their first choice goalkeeper Naseem Akhtar who is down with chicken pox.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians get down to business
                                                   Indians get down to business
                      
	Christchurch: A game of rugby and some fielding and batting drills comprised the strenuous three-hour workout that the Indian cricket team went through at the picturesque Bert Sutcliffe Oval Saturday.         
	Although Mahendra Singh Dhonis men are the Twenty20 world champions, they will bear in mind that they had been humbled by 10 runs by the resilient Black Caps during the inaugural championship in Johannesburg last September.         
	Warming up with a game of touch rugby, Dhonis men were put through the fielding drills by coach Gary Kirsten before they moved to the adjacent ground for a hit at the nets.         
	Kirsten spent some time separately with Rohit Sharma, urging the youngster to get his front foot in the right place while driving the ball. Time and again, Kirsten walked up to the middle to guide the Mumbaikar with his bio-mechanics before Rohit got his act right in the second session for a knock against Ishant Sharma and Irfan Pathan.         
	Sachin Tendulkar went in soon after, often walking up to Kirsten and asking him to pitch the ball in a particular position so that he could lean into his shots.         
	Pace spearhead Zaheer Khan chose to go for a run alongside bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad, much after his teammates had packed their bags.         
	India, who play two Twenty20 matches, a five-ODI series followed by three Tests during the tour, have not won a Test series in New Zealand for 41 years.           (PTI)

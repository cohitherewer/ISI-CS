The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Narhari Amin resigns from GCA post
                                                   Narhari Amin resigns from GCA post
                      
	Ahmedabad: Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) president and Congress leader Narhari Amin resigned on Saturday from his post after a 16-year reign during which he made the state association turn around from a debt-ridden one to a body having reserves of Rs 40 crore.         
	I have been unopposed as president of GCA since 1993. There has been a movement from the BJP group to wrest control of GCA for some time now. So I have resigned, Amin, a former deputy chief minister of Gujarat, said.         
	In the last 16 years, I have never played politics with development of cricket in Gujarat. The situation has become such that now, elections would have been enforced for the control of GCA. So, I thought it fit to resign from my post, he said.         
	For the last one year, Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modis right hand man and minister of state for home Amit Shah had started a campaign to ouster Amin. Amin submitted his resignation to GCA vice-president Vikram Patel and as per the rules of the association, Patel has to call a general body meeting of the GCA within 15 days to elect a new president.

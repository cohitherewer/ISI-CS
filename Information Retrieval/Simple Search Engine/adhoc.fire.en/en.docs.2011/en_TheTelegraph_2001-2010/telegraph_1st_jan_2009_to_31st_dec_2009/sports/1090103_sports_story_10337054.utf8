The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hayden confident of hitting critics for six
                                                     Hayden confident of hitting critics for six
    - Bollinger, McDonald set to make debut unchanged SA eye whitewash           Simon Briggs            Matthew Hayden                                 
	Sydney: It took a century in the final game of the 2005 Ashes series to save Matthew Haydens Test career. Now Hayden is under pressure to repeat the dose in Fridays third and final Test against South Africa. He needs runs  big runs  if he wants to be sure of returning to England for next summers rematch.         
	Hayden turned 37 in October, and his recent innings have lacked the brutal certainty that once made him the worlds most intimidating opener. His critics accuse him of clogging up the ranks when new blood is urgently needed. But there is also a school of thought  neatly expressed by South Africas coach Mickey Arthur  that Haydens experience is still valuable for an Australian team in transition.         
	Hayden seemed in good spirits Thursday. The bowling was provided by former teammate Glenn McGrath, whose late wife is to be remembered on the third day of this Test by a pink-shirted campaign to raise funds for breast cancer research.         
	Hayden allowed himself to be clean-bowled by McGraths eight-year-old son James. Afterwards, he told reporters he did not intend to change anything about his approach to this Test. He has already played 102 of them, after all.         
	Ive been written off many times and thrived on the fact that Ive come back. Now we go into a stage of our careers where weve got transition in players, weve got legendary figures like Glenn who are leaving the game, and its our job as senior players to stand up and perform. I know I need to get runs. But theres a lot more facets to the game than just pure runs: experience in the side also makes a difference.         
	The two players most closely scrutinised in the build-up to this match will be Hayden and Graeme Smith, though for very different reasons. Smith has no form issues: he was the worlds leading batsman of 2008, scoring an astonishing 1656 runs at 72. But he remains a slight doubt because of his long-standing elbow injury, which has caused him excruciating pain since it flared up during his heroic 154 not out at Edgbaston last summer.         
	Smith is so desperate not to let the Australians off the hook that he is still intending to battle through the pain barrier one more time in Sydney. After the match, however, he will skip the one-day series and return home for treatment. As for this Test in Sydney, it may be a dead rubber but there is still plenty hanging on the result. A 3-0 whitewash would not only be the worst defeat ever suffered by Australia at home, it would also cost them their No.1 ranking on the official standings. Smiths fast-rising South Africans would replace them at the top.         
	To make matters worse, the Aussies will be missing Brett Lee and Andrew Symonds. Left-arm pacer Doug Bollinger and allrounder Andrew McDonald will replace them.         
	TEAMS         
	Australia (likely): Ricky Ponting, Matthew Hayden, Simon Katich, Michael Hussey, Michael Clarke, Andrew McDonald, Brad Haddin, Mitchell Johnson, Nathan Hauritz, Peter Siddle, Doug Bollinger.         
	South Africa: Graeme Smith, Neil McKenzie, Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, A.B. de Villiers, J.P. Duminy, Mark Boucher, Morne Morkel, Paul Harris, Dale Steyn, Makhaya Ntini.

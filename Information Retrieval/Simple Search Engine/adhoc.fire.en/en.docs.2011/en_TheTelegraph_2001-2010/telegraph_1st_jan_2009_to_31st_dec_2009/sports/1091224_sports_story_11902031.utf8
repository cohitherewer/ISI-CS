	Calcutta: The all Grandmaster India A proved their superiority over India B team and almost made a clean sweep in the second round of the Tata Steel Asian Team Chess Championship, being organised by Dibyendu Barua Chess Academy and All Sport Management, at the Town Hall, here on Wednesday.         
	After the second round, India A and Indonesia men jointly shared the top honours with four points, while India A and Vietnam are even tied with four points in the womens section.         
	The only saving grace for the India B team was National champion B Adhibans draw against GM P Harikrishna in an exciting top board struggle.         
	The India A captain, Krishnan Sasikiran, and Surya Sekhar Ganguly won with ease against S Satyapragyan and RR Laxman, while Parimarjan Negi won a long game against Deep Sengupta.         
	On the second board, Vietnam and Iran were locked in a hard-fought battle which ended in both the teams splitting points. Vietnam and Iran are in the second place with three points.         
	The India A womens team won a closely-fought match against Iran while the India B team went down to Vietnam rather tamely with Mary Ann Gomes being the only winner, while the rest Nisha Mohota, Padmini Rout and Bhakti Kulkarni lost their games.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clarke blames it on facilities
                                                   Clarke blames it on facilities
                      
	Melbourne: Australias stand-in skipper Michael Clarke has blamed lack of access to the facilities at the Oval for their drubbing in the fifth Ashes Test.         
	The facilities were being used by the Surrey Cricket Club.         
	It is a little bit disappointing that other priorities have taken place in the indoor facilities here at the Oval. I used the bowling machine in the indoor nets as part of my preparation throughout the whole Test series, I guess its no coincidence why I didnt make any runs here, said Clarke.         
	Surrey Cricket Club had contracted the nets area to ticket and events agency Keith Prowse, who used the space to host clients during matches. Clarke also questioned ground preparation in England, following Tuesdays abandonment of the second Twenty20 match in Manchester as 15 hours before, the Lancashire cricketers were playing a county match on the same surface.         
	The ground has to be fit to play. Maybe the covering system is something the counties can look at. For me, the wicket is first and foremost, the priority is to keep that dry; second are the bowlers run-ups. Both ends of the run-ups, the other night, were just not up to scratch and thats the main reason I believe the umpires did not rule the ground fit, Clarke said.         
	Clarke supported coach Tim Nielsen for taking a break after the first four one-dayers in the ongoing seven-match series against England.         
	A tired Nielsen will return home, leaving his deputy Troy Cooley to coach the side in the final three one-dayers, before rejoining the team in South Africa on September 22 as Australia prepare to defend their Champions Trophy title.         
	Hes been away from home for a long time. We players get the opportunity to have a break every now and then, I think its just as important for our support staff, Clarke said. Theres going to be various times throughout everybodys career when he needs a bit of time away from the game.         
	Nielsen, nicknamed Vinny, has been with the Australian team since last September in the various international series, including the World Twenty20 and the Ashes, and he will spend time with his family in Adelaide during the break.         
	Hes looking forward to spending a week at home. The players have utmost respect for the coach, and within the team, we know we can continue to perform when Vinnys not there. But hes a huge part of our team and giving him whats probably going to be a week off, I think, is the least we can do, Clarke said.

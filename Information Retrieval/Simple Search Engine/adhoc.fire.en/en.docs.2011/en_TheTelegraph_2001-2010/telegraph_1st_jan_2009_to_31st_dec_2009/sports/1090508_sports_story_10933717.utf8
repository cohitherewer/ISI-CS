    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  Pak coach says series vs Australia has given boys valuable exposure             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Dubai: Pakistans coach Intikhab Alam spoke to The Telegraph for half-an-hour at the Grand Hyatt here on Thursday morning.         
	Intikhab, whod been in the same chair when Pakistan won the 1992 World Cup, had his fingers crossed for the one-off T20 International against Australia at night.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q How are you and the team coping with no international cricket at home?         
	A Its disappointing, but the circumstances are such... All teams like to play at home... The good thing is that we havent stopped playing altogether... Soon after the matches in the UAE, well be off to England for the World T20... Then, well be travelling to Sri Lanka... Later in the year, well be seen in Australia... After that, in New Zealand... But, yes, nothing at home is disappointing... If we didnt have commitments overseas, then it wouldve been complete isolation.         
	Must be a relief that Australia agreed to play five ODIs and one T20 in the UAE...         
	Absolutely. It has given the boys valuable exposure.         
	Pakistan lost the ODIs 2-3. As coach, whats your take?         
	We had our moments and, indeed, shouldve won... The batting didnt really click, though Misbah-ul Haq and Kamran Akmal did have a couple of good innings... I cant be critical of the batsmen as we havent regularly been playing top teams... The Australians, remember, had only just finished touring South Africa... Something like that makes a difference and, so, in the circumstances we did pretty well.         
	Veteran Shahid Afridi seems to have made a point...         
	I have a lot of time for Shahid... He bowled very well (with 10, highest wicket-taker in the ODIs) and got some runs as well... He kind of blossomed in the ODIs...         
	The last captain, Shoaib Malik, didnt want him in the team... Plus, Afridi has been quite controversial. How have you been handling him?         
	Malik must have had his reasons... I find Shahid a nice boy... Every player needs confidence and both the captain (Younis Khan) and I have given that to Shahid... Weve made him feel important.         
	How is Younis as captain?         
	Very good... Focused and extremely committed... Whats important is that hes enjoying the captaincy... Were on the same wavelength.         
	Maliks attitude?         
	Positive... I havent seen him do or say anything to suggest hes bitter about having lost the captaincy... Malik contributes at team meetings.         
	Initially, was there some tension in the dressing room?         
	No.         
	Its no secret that one of your reports led to Maliks removal, earlier this year...         
	Yes, I did have a hand in Younis appointment... Whatever I communicated wasnt driven by an agenda... People know that.         
	Today, is Shoaib Akhtar suitable only for T20?         
	Well, depends on the situation... Hes experienced, though...         
	Shoaib is seen as Pakistan crickets problem child. How have you been dealing with him?         
	Actually, Ive found him to be quite a nice person... Hes willing to listen... Of course, Ive given him the respect a senior should be given.         
	The past few weeks have seen a couple of bowlers, including Pakistan offie Saeed Ajmal, hauled up for a suspect action. Whats the way forward on this issue?         
	One way forward is to be consistent... Ajmal had played quite a bit before the ODIs against Australia, but nobody had said anything... There has to be consistency. (After a pause) Now, he has to go through the prescribed process.         
	Looking ahead, the World T20 meet is less than a month away. Your thoughts?         
	Weve got a good chance... Its more a matter of encouraging self-belief and the players themselves believing they can do it... Theyre the ones whove got to believe that nothing is impossible. Often, when the skills are almost on a par, strong self-belief makes the difference.         
	After the tournament got moved to South Africa, shouldnt the IPL have allowed players from Pakistan to turn out for the franchises?         
	Yes... The boys have been very disappointed.         
	Your World T20 preparations wouldve been better had your players taken part in the ongoing IPL...         
	You could say so... However, theyve at least been playing international cricket. Once we return home (early on Saturday), a T20 programme will be chalked out involving our squad for the world meet.         
	Whats special about the uncapped left-arm quick, Mohammed Aamer?         
	Hes young (a teenager) and hes fast... If Im not wrong, he averages 144 kmph, which is quick... Hes been at the National Academy in Lahore and the coaches there have been working with him.         
	Any development on the ICL front?         
	Not aware, really. The ICL lot was allowed to play domestic cricket, but that was all. A couple of them still have a role to play at the international level.         
	When will Indo-Pak cricket resume?         
	Sadly, I have no idea... Cricket shouldnt suffer, yet at the same time, you cant play in an atmosphere where theres tension... It has to be conducive.         
	The last one: Youve been a captain and are back as coach. Do you support the multiple leaders concept floated by John Buchanan?         
	(Laughs) Not at all... There has to be one captain, one person to call the shots... Nothing stops teammates from offering suggestions... They dont have to be identified as captains or leaders... The captain is most important, not the coach, who should remain in the background and constantly feed his captain.

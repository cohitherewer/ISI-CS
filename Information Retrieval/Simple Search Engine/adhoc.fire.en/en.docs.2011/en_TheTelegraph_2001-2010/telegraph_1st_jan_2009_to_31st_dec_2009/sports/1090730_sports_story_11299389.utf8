	Dambulla: After losing the three-match Test series, Pakistan are still looking for the first win of their Sri Lanka tour as the teams prepare for a five-match one-day International series that starts Thursday.         
	Sri Lanka remain wary of the tourists who have enjoyed more success at the shorter version of the game.         
	We just need to forget everything and move forward. The team knows that we didnt play to our potential and that itself is good enough motivation for us, Pakistan captain Younis Khan told reporters on the eve of the first match at Rangiri Dambulla Stadium.         
	His counterpart, Kumar Sangakkara, is hoping his team will not be complacent after the 2-0 Test series win.         
	We may have won the Test series, but we have new players coming into the side and we need to get back the momentum and regroup soon to come on top, Sangakkara said.         
	I feel they play the shorter form of the game better. They can be a temperamental side, but at the same time, (they are) a very tough team in ODI cricket.         
	Pakistan has been boosted by the return of several players who were involved in the Indian Cricket League.         
	Participation in the unsanctioned league meant that they were banned from international cricket, but they are now allowed to play for their country after breaking ties with the league.         
	Opener Imran Nazir and fast bowler Rana Naved return to the squad while Mohammed Yousuf and Abdul Razzaq have been part of the Test squad after pulling out of the league.         
	My hands are open and I have welcomed them. When they joined the ICL, it was a massive blow for Pakistani cricket. Now that they are back I am extremely pleased, Younis said.         
	With the pitch in Dambulla expected to suit seam bowlers Sri Lanka boosted their seam attack by drafting in Dilhara Fernando.         
	The Sri Lanka squad now feature six fast bowlers. The hosts are buoyed by the return of off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan, the highest wicket-taker in the game. (AP)

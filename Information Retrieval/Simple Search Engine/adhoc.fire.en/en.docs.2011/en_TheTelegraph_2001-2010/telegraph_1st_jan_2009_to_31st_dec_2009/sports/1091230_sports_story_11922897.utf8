The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A fresh angle comes to light
                                                                                                                       7                                      A fresh angle comes to light
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: After a busy passing-the-buck game between them and CESC over the fiasco with the lights during the fourth ODI at the Eden, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), it seems, has finally seen light at the end of the tunnel.         
	The CAB now suspects that the uninterruptible power supply (UPS) device, connected with the High Court end light tower, might have something to do with the voltage drop that resulted in 26 minutes of darkness during the match.         
	The association had kept the lights of the tower in question on, since 1pm Tuesday, in a bid to determine the cause of the problem.         
	According to sources in the state association, there was power fluctuation during Mondays inspection by the seven-member committee as well.         
	Questions were raised about the utility of the UPS and, on Tuesday, the CAB, experimentally, decided to do away with the device and connect the tower directly to the control circuit of the stadium.         
	Interestingly, without the UPS, the power supply ran smoothly Tuesday and that has led to the conclusion, in a certain section within the association, that there might have been some problem with the UPS.         
	For the record, the UPS (5KVA-single phase), one each for the four towers, was installed following recommendations from a government committee looking into the power failure that took place at the Eden during the first edition of the Indian Premier League in 2008. It was argued that the UPS would serve as backup in case of a crisis.         
	Before that, from 1993  when floodlights were installed  power supply from the control circuit to the towers used to be direct.         
	Earlier, while the CAB had blamed the CESC for the voltage fluctuation, the company had shrugged off responsibility saying poor maintenance on the part of the association was behind the crisis.         
	However, it is yet to be ascertained as to what exactly was the problem with the UPS and a further round of tests by the technicians is awaited.         
	But as of now, theres a strong possibility that the CAB will want to go back to the old system for uninterrupted power supply.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pietersen and I have moved on: Flintoff
                                                   Pietersen and I have moved on: Flintoff
            DEREK PRINGLE                      
	Antigua: Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen are the million-dollar men in Englands team with almost the same number of differences separating them.         
	The two may not be close, but as Flintoff confirmed on Tuesday, they are not sworn enemies either, though he did refer to the recently deposed England captain as Kevin rather than the chummier KP.         
	It was Pietersens removal as captain that brought the pairs relationship under the microscope after some newspapers claimed Flintoff had failed to back him when Hugh Morris took the players temperature over a change of coach.         
	There has been no strong evidence of this but Chinese whispers have grown, which may be why Flintoff was keen to put the matter to bed in Antigua.         
	Losing Peter Moores and then Kevin as captain, thats happened and its done and dusted, Flintoff said. Mine and Kevins relationship, we get on fine, theres no problems there. You talk about all the things that have happened being a distraction. But weve spoken about what happened. And while the conversation we had will stay between me and him, weve all moved on. Were trying to win Test matches, were not worried about what happened a month ago.         
	You are never going to get on brilliantly with everyone you play with in any sport, but a lack of compatibility off the field should not impinge on your work together on it. At net practice, Flintoff and Pietersen shared a cricket bag as a seat so there is obviously not a mutual loathing between them.         
	That focus on winning Tests did not exactly work out in Kingston, where England lost by an innings and 23 runs. It is not the first time they have been down after the first Test, especially abroad. They have been one down after one match on all of the last seven tours.         
	On just two of those occasions have they avoided a series defeat, in India in 2006 and New Zealand this time last year.         
	Lack of preparation is routinely blamed, though not by the players and administrators, who know that big-bucks salaries are only fed by fitting in as much big-match cricket as possible.         
	Its a big test of everyone, agreed Flintoff. After the game in Kingston we were flat and a little bit down. As bad as it was in Jamaica, it was the first of four Tests, so we can still win the series and we need to believe that. But we need to start performing on a cricket field, though Im confident we can do that.         
	Professional sportsmen are trained not to dwell on doubt, but when you get dismissed for 51 on a fairly blameless pitch, you cannot expect everyone to stick the experience into their mental rubbish basket.         
	Thats going to be the test for people after a game like that, said Flintoff. Its not about technique but character and we need to come back strongly on Friday. We met on Monday night and had an honest chat as a group of lads. But we need to get things moving in the right direction quickly.         
	There have been suggestions from former England captain Graham Gooch that the players were distracted by the recent upheavals such as the IPL auction.         
	We cant blame any potential distractions, they are not in your mind when youre batting or running in to bowl, Flintoff said.

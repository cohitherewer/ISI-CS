The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lanka ICCs first choice for Champions Trophy
                                                     Lanka ICCs first choice for Champions Trophy
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            The victorious Australian team with the 2006 Champions Trophy                           
	Calcutta: Unless the weather feedback is negative, Sri Lanka (specifically capital Colombo) will host the re-scheduled Champions Trophy, from September 24 to October 5.         
	The tournament, first organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1998, albeit under a different name, was to have been hosted by Pakistan last September.         
	It got deferred because of security concerns and, on Sunday, the ICC decided to re-locate it altogether.         
	The new venue wont be announced till April, when the next executive board meeting is scheduled, but a well-placed source informed The Telegraph that Sri Lanka is choice No.1.         
	From what I know, the ICC has begun studying the weather pattern in Colombo for about a month from the middle of September Thats being done as the only Champions Trophy hosted by Sri Lanka, in September 2002, had been rain-marred, the well-placed source said.         
	With rain ruining that final in Colombo, the edition had been jointly won by the Sourav Ganguly-captained India and Sri Lanka, then led by Sanath Jayasuriya.         
	Sourav has retired, but Jayasuriya, in his 40th year, is still taking guard.         
	The well-placed source added: If the weather data indeed is discouraging then the ICC may float a tender and the new host would then be decided by bidding Otherwise, Colombo (which has three grounds for Tests/ODIs) is going to see more cricket action.         
	Incidentally, the ICC is very satisfied with the organisational skills of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC).         
	There are frequent changes within SLC, but the country has done a good job whenever it has hosted ICC events  be it a tournament like the Champions Trophy or the U-19 World Cups. The ICC, therefore, is very satisfied on that score, is how another well-placed source put it.         
	If it comes to bidding, it wont surprise if the UAE makes a strong pitch. The tournament, after all, can be hosted by three Emirates  Abu Dhabi, Dubai (where the ICC is headquartered) and Sharjah.         
	Sharjah and Abu Dhabi have already been venues for big-time cricket.         
	The last Champions Trophy was held in India, in October-November 2006, when Australia won for the first time.

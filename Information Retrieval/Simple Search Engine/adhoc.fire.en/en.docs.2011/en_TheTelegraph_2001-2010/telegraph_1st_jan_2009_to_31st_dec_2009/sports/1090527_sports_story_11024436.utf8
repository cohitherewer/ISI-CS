The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Focus now on T20 League and transfers
                                                   Focus now on T20 League and transfers
                      
	Melbourne: The IPL over focus now shifts to the Champions League T20 where franchisees will be seen engaged in a keen players transfer game.         
	New South Wales, one of the Australian participants, may lose David Warner, who is likely to stay with the Delhi DareDevils for the 12-team tournament to be held in India in October.         
	To retain the services of the big-hitting Warner, Delhi will have to play around $250,000 to New South Wales.         
	New South Wales in turn are expected to use this money to secure the services of Brendon McCullum, who led the Kolkata Knight Riders in this years IPL, from New Zealand team Otago.         
	However it will be interesting to see which side McCullum chooses to represent. The organisers have left it to players to choose the side they wish to play for.         
	McCullum is eligible to play for New South Wales because he played for the Blues in last seasons domestic final against Victoria.         
	There is no doubt having McCullum in your team increases your chances of winning, that is an undeniable fact. Its about ensuring we have got all the bases covered. (Making Otago an offer) is certainly something we will consider. It is a cost-neutral exercise, chief executive David Gilbert told an Australian daily.

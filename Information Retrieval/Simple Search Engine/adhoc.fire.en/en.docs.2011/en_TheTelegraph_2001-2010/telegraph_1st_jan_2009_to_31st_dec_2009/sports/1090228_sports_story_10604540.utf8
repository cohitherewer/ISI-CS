The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Flintoff to return home
                                                   Flintoff to return home
                      
	Bridgetown: England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff will be flying home from the West Indies for treatment on his hip injury and will miss the final Test, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said on Friday.         
	Flintoff, who is not involved in the fourth match being played in Barbados, will miss the final Test in Trinidad starting on March 6 but will leave with a view to returning for the subsequent one-day series, the ECB said.         
	According to an ECB statement, Flintoffs possible return date to the Caribbean was March 10 which would give him five days before a Twenty20 game in Trinidad and 10 days before the five-match one-day series begins in Guyana.         
	However, the wording of the ECB statement indicates that it is far from certain whether the Lancastrian, who has suffered a series of injuries in recent years, will be back in the Caribbean.         
	Flintoff suffered the hip injury during the drawn Test in Antigua but continued to bowl even though teammates said he was in pain.         
	Ravi Bopara and pace bowler Amjad Khan were drafted into the England squad after Flintoffs injury and the former is in the side for the fourth Test. (REUTERS)

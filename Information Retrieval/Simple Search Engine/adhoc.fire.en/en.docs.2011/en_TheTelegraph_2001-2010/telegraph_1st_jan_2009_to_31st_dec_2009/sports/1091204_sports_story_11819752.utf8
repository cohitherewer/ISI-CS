The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Still a good track to bat on: Sehwag
                                                                                                                       7                                      Still a good track to bat on: Sehwag
                      
	Mumbai: Virender Sehwag, who is on the verge of becoming the first player to score three triple centuries in Test cricket, said he was determined to play a big knock after missing a similar opportunity in the previous Test in Kanpur. He fell for 131 in the second Test.         
	I had missed it a couple of times in the last two Tests and I did not want to miss it again here. I decided to take my time, see through the new ball and build my innings, he said.         
	Sehwag has made Muttiah Muralidharan look pretty pedestrian in the ongoing series and the swashbuckling opener says offence is the best defence against the Sri Lankan spinner.         
	During the course of his unbeaten 284 Thursday, Sehwag repeatedly came down the track to unsettle Murali, who gave away 119 runs in his 20 wicket-less overs.         
	Murali is a big challenge to face. If you have to play against a spinner like him, you have to attack him. Otherwise he will come and dominate you. So instead of allowing him to dominate, I dominated right from the first ball and pushed him into the back foot, Sehwag said.         
	Post-lunch, Sehwag was simply unstoppable. Then I was seeing the ball really well. So I thought lets bat the way I bat  see the ball, hit the ball.         
	Its still a good track to bat on. First day, the wicket was little damp so the ball seamed a bit. It was much better today and I think from the fourth day, the track would turn, Sehwag said.

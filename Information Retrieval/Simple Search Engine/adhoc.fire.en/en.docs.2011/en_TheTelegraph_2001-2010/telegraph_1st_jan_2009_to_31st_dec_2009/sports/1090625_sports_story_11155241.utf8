            A STAFF REPORTER            Mohun Bagan cricketers after the victory at the Eden on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Former India under-19 captain Virat Kohli scored a blistering 121-ball 184 as Mohun Bagan bagged their second title of the season beating Town Club by 97 runs in the final of the P Sen Trophy at the Eden.         
	On a hot and sultry Wednesday, Virat hit 20 boundaries and eight sixes to register the second highest score in the tournaments history. Mahendra Singh Dhonis unbeaten 207 for Shambazar in a quarter final match against Sporting Union in 2005-06 is the competition record.         
	The 20-year old right-hand bat put together a 159-run second wicket partnership with Wriddhiman Saha after Bagan, who elected to bat first, lost opener Manish Pandey on the very second ball of the match.         
	While Wriddhiman fell six runs short of a half-century, Kohlis fiery innings was over after Sourav Tiwary caught him off Suvojit Chakrabarty.         
	My teammates told me about (MS) Dhonis knock and I had that in mind, Kohli said after the match. In the last innings I did not get runs. So I was pretty determined this time. I knew that if I hang in there, the runs would come, he added.         
	BRIEF SCORES         
	Mohun Bagan 312 in 50 overs (V. Kohli 184; S. Chakrabarty 5/45). Town Club 215 in 45 overs (Ashrafuddin 5/39). Mohun Bagan won by 97 runs.

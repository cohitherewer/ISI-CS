                                                     Jayawardene ready for series vs India
                  Mahela                     
	Karachi: Confident after winning the one day series in Pakistan, Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene has set sights on the ensuing home series against India from Wednesday.         
	The Sri Lankan captain said that his boys are keen to avenge their last year ODI series loss to Mahendra Singh Dhonis boys on home soil and the win over Pakistan will help them in a big way.         
	Last time the ODI series defeat to India hurt us badly. We are now looking forward to turn things around this time, Jayawardene said on Sunday before leaving Pakistan.         
	Sri Lanka went down 2-3 to Team India in their last series on the island nation. India are scheduled to play five one-day Internationals and two Twenty20 matches there.         
	Jayawardene, who was happy with his teams performance in Pakistan however, cautioned his players that India would be a tougher opponent compared to Pakistan.         
	It has been a good series for us in Pakistan and the players showed lot of character. The batting has also started to click so its a good sign and progress before we take on India.         
	India is shaping up well in both forms of the game. In the last series we beat them in the Tests but lost the one-day matches So I feel it would be a good series this time and we would try to keep the momentum going, Jayawardene said.

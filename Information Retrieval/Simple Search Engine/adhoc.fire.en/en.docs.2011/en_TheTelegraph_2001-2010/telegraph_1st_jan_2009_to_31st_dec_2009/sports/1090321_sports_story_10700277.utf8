The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Only pride is at stake for India 
                                                   Only pride is at stake for India 
                      
	Sydney: A demoralised India will take on an equally dejected Australia in the third/fourth-place playoff at Bankstown Oval here Saturday. Both of them missed out on a final berth due to a combination of reasons not least of which was the superior performances put in by New Zealand and England, the finalists for Sundays title clash.         
	The Super Six stage defeat against New Zealand put paid to Indias hopes for a place in Sundays final and the 2005 finalists now play for pride against the hosts.         
	Considering they are defending champions, Australias fate was worse as they could not recover from their Super Six stage defeat against India, something they would like to avenge when Karen Roltons side takes on the Jhulan Goswami-led Indians.         
	Despite their failure to reach the final, India have, at least, the consolation of having automatically qualified for the 2013 World Cup at home; this, by virtue of a top-four finish. England, New Zealand and Australia are the other teams that have secured automatic qualification.         
	India captain Jhulan Goswami was almost in tears after the loss against New Zealand and admitted it might be the last campaign for many of her teammates.         
	It is a very disappointing day. We worked extremely hard for the World Cup but all has gone down the drain because of one bad performance, Jhulan had rued. It is a devastating blow to all of us as the next World Cup will be after four years and who knows who will be there then, she said.         
	The Indian Super Six campaign opened with a stunning 16-run win over Australia but a loss to New Zealand in the next match put paid to their hopes. Even the thumping eight-wicket triumph over the West Indies in the next match could not help their cause as results of the other Super Six games didnt favour India.

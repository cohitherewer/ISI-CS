The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ganguly, Chanda in second round
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ganguly, Chanda in second round
                                            Sandipan Chanda and Surya Sekhar Ganguly       
	Khanty Mansiysk (Russia): Asian champion Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Sandipan Chanda progressed to the second round of the World Chess Cup but GM Krishnan Sasikirans fate was still hanging balance after a second draw in a row Sunday.         
	Sasikiran signed peace with GM Erwin LAmi of the Netherlands in the second game of the first round and will have to fight it out in the tiebreak to advance to the next stage.         
	Ganguly, who already had one game under his belt, scored a fine victory over Anton Filippov of Uzbekistan.         
	Chandas first game victory proved crucial as he held the higher-ranked Mikhail Kobalia of Russia to advance.         
	Sasikiran could do little with his pieces as LAmi came up with some thematic defensive moves to steer the game towards a draw. It was a Catalan opening wherein Sasikiran sacrificed a pawn early to get more space on the chequered board.         
	LAmi played solid moves in the opening and, when he was trying to break free, Sasikiran decided against taking any undue risk and went for a repetition of moves. Peace was signed in just 18 moves.         
	Having won the first game with ease, Ganguly was in his elements yet again as he crushed Filippov who played the white side of a Sicilian Najdorf.         
	The Indian went nearly an hour ahead, showcasing his deep preparation and, when opportunity came, went for wild complications wherein his extra time helped a great deal.         
	Filippov lost a handful of pawns and resigned after 46 moves.         
	Playing the black side of a Sicilian Scheveningen, the Calcutta-based Chanda faced no trouble in the middle game and exchanged pieces almost at will to reach a slightly favourable endgame. Seeing that he had no chances, Kobalia proposed the draw on move 40.         
	GM Abhijit Kunte and IM Sriram Jha went out of the World Cup following losses, respectively, against stalwarts Alexei Shirov and Alexander Grischuk.         
	Abhijit was saddled with a bad position out of the middle game and could not recover while unwarranted complications spelt disaster for Jha.         
	GM Parimarjan Negi lost to Vadim Milov of Switzerland but the young Indian is still in the fray as he had won his first round game.         
	Parimarjans weak moves in the middle game were subtly handled by Milov and the Swiss has now earned a right to fight the second youngest GM ever in the tiebreak games. The 2008 world junior champion, Abhijeet Gupta, too, was ousted after losing the return game with black against Nikita Vitiugov of Russia.

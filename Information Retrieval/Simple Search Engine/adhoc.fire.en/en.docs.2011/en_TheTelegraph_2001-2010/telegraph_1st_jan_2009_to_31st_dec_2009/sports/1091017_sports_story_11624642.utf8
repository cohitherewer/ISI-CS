The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sporting take on Pune
                                                   Sporting take on Pune
                      
	Margao: Hosts Sporting Clube de Goa would be looking to secure their first I-League points when they take on newcomers Pune FC in a third round match Saturday.         
	Sportings opening match against Air India was washed away due to heavy downpour and the club would be keen to shrug off the disappointment of a loss to Shillong Lajong FC in their last outing.         
	Pune FC, on the other hand, will miss Brazilian striker Edmar Figueira who is out with an injury. However, the return of medio Shanmugam Venkatesh will bolster the attack that lacked zeal in their last match against Air India.

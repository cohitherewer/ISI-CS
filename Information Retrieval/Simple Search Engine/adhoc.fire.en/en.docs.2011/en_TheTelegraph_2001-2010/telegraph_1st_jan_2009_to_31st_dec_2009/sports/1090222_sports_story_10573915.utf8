  - SUPER SUNDAY 
  -   BAGAN, EB SQUARE OFF WITH LOTS AT STAKE         ANSHUMAN ROY                                      
	Calcutta: If you forget history for a while, then Sundays I-League match between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan is just a clash of a team in the middle of a fantastic run against a side still trying to get a foothold in the league.         
	But then it is just not possible to keep history aside when the archrivals square off in what is Bengals most enduring battle.         
	The passion, the emotions and the excitement have such an effect that one tends to reel from it. And you dont have to be a derby veteran to understand a simple fact: Current form or past records hardly matter; whoever holds his nerve on the day leaves the pitch with a smiling face.         
	Yes! In a derby clash nothing else matters. So, Bagans enviable nine-match unbeaten streak against their sworn enemies at the Salt Lake Stadium hardly counts, the fact that they are on the top of the I-League also doesnt come into the picture.         
	Agrees Jose Ramirez Barreto, the man who has won many a derby for the green-and-maroon brigade: Its a different game altogether; different in every aspect. Past records, current form dont count when we meet East Bengal.         
	The red and gold brigade just needs a win to turn the wheel around. The Salt Lake ghost will be buried for good, and the pretenders (read Sporting Clube de Goa and Churchill Brothers) will fancy their chances of pipping Bagan at the post.         
	For Bagan, more than recording a perfect 10 at the Salt Lake Stadium, the fact that they are one of the favourites for the title, is the driving force on the eve of the Sunday skirmish. Forget this perfect 10, we want to win this match to stay ahead of the pack, seems to be the mantra.         
	From seasoned pros like Deepak Mondal, Bhaichung Bhutia and Barreto to youngsters like Rakesh Masih and Lalkamal Bhowmick, this I-League title will be the icing on the cake.         
	It cant be another so-near-yet-so-far story, says Lalkamal. The playmaker may get a nod ahead of Rakesh Masih even though coach Karim Bencharifa kept his cards close to his chest.         
	The afternoon practice session at the club ground saw Lalkamal practising with the first team and given the skilful medios knack for sending accurate passes to the frontliners, it wont be surprising if he gets a start Sunday.         
	If Bencharifa refused to divulge the first eleven  an exasperated scribe even went to the extent of calling the Moroccan too boring  his East Bengal counterpart Subhas Bhowmick was open enough to name the team. Whether its just mind games from a coach, who by his own admission has been actively involved in derby matches for the last 35 years, remains to be seen. After all, a derby match and no gimmick just dont gel.         
	Ever since, Bhowmick took over the reins from Stanley Rozario, it has been a roller-coaster ride for East Bengal. A draw and a loss, followed by two convincing victories have suddenly put a spring in their steps.         
	And when you see at least 100 spectators thronging the club ground to see their stars at the morning practice session, you can feel that the fans are sensing something big.         
	I strongly believe our time has come. Everything has its end and this jinx also will see its end, Alvito DCunha was saying the other day.         
	For that to come true, East Bengal will have to deal with the twin threat of Bhaichung and Barreto. Known for hogging the limelight on the big stage, these two have time and again spoilt East Bengals day.         
	The red-and-gold brigades defence, which has this reputation of bungling under pressure, will have to work overtime to negate the threat.         
	The presence of Ismael Addo in the midfield does give Bhowmicks spine some solidity but the Ghanaian is not fully fit. He is expected to play through pain and the rationale behind fielding a half-fit player will be questioned if things go awry.         
	East Bengal can draw solace from the fact that Sunil Chetri and Yusif Yakubu are returning to goal-scoring ways and Mohun Bagan are a tad wary of the duo. On their day they can destroy anyone, says Ishfaq Ahmed.         
	Its not just the deadly duo that Bagan should keep an eye on, one Syed Rahim Nabi can also spoil their day.         
	The utility man of East Bengal will be manning the right half of the midfield and will surely give the Bagan defence a few anxious moments.         
	The kick-off is at 6.30 p.m.

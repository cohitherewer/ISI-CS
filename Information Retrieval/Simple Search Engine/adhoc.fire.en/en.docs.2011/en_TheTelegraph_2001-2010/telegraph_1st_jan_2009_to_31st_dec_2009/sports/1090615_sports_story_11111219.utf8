The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gill joins hands with new body
                                                   Gill joins hands with new body
            OUR BUREAU                      
	The deposed Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) president, K.P.S. Gill on Sunday decided to join hands with the newly-formed Hockey India (HI) and withdraw court cases against the Indian Olympic Association (IOA).         
	In a news conference in New Delhi, Gill, who was unceremoniously removed after India failed to qualify for the Beijing Olympics, said he had formed a six-member sub-committee to work out the modalities of IHFs merger with the IOA-backed Hockey India.         
	The sudden development is definitely a setback for the J.B. Roy-led Bengal Hockey Association (BHA), which is now completely isolated in its fight against the formation of Hockey India.         
	However, in a move that can only make the Indian hockey scene murkier, a faction headed by Roy Sunday claimed to have formed a new body after the merger of the mens and womens associations.         
	Both the associations have now merged and J.B. Roy will be president, a source, who attended a two-day meeting of the rival group in Amby Valley, the holiday resort owned by Sahara about 150 kms from Mumbai, told The Telegraph.         
	There were 27 of the 37 mens association members and 19 out of 25 of the womens associations. All the members who attended were of secretary level or above. We have the majority, the source added.         
	Gill, who shared the dais with Hockey India secretary general Mohammed Aslam, said he took this step for the improvement and promotion of India hockey. The game should not suffer, he quipped.         
	While Aslam claimed there was no secret understanding between the IHF and Hockey India, sources said Gill was assured rehabilitation in the newly-formed body.         
	He is unlikely to be chosen as the president again but Gill may be offered some decorative post, said a source.

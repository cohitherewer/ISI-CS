The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB reads the riot act
                                                     CAB reads the riot act
            A STAFF REPORTER            Avishek Jhunjhunwalas batting order has been a bone of contention                           
	Calcutta: Bengals cup of woes seems to have overflowed quite early into the season. After two losses in the East Zone Twenty20 meet in Dhanbad, the Laxmi Ratan Shuklas are in a rut with no one to pull them out.         
	Quite expectedly the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) brass was perturbed by the pathetic performance and a strong message has been relayed to the bungling players. Heads will roll if players commitment is found to be wanting. Even the seniors will not be spared, the message was loud and clear.         
	Assistant secretary Naresh Ojha was in Dhanbad during the day, and passed on the message to the players and support staff in no uncertain terms.         
	Thursdays seven-wicket loss to Jharkhand, in fact, had the skeletons tumbling out of the cupboard. Under-fire skipper Shukla and Manoj Tiwary were reportedly involved in a spat after the loss in the dressing room. Manoj was also fined 80 per cent of his match fee for showing dissent after his dismissal.         
	Its not just a clash of egos which is ruining the teams fortunes. The batting order also has become a bone of contention for the Bengal think-tank. Why on earth does Avishek Jhunjhunwala come in at No.7 and why should Sreevats Goswami bat at No. 3? an upset CAB official asked.         
	Theres a nexus going on in the team Players belonging to a certain club seem to call the shots Its not as if the CAB brass and team management is not aware of it. This has to stop right now if Bengal has to improve, the source added.         
	What is Sreevats Goswamis performance? Why isnt Avishek, Bengals most successful batsman in the practice matches, made to bat at No. 3? Performance doesnt seem to get top priority in selection, said a former Bengal captain.         
	Shuklas leadership is again under the scanner. We need to find a solid leader one who will inspire the team through his performance. If needed we can promote Wriddhiman Saha or have him as somebody elses understudy Bengal will gain in the long term from such a move, the former captain added.         
	It was learnt that Rohan Gavaskar may be showcaused for his indifferent attitude. He seems to be in his own world There has to be some accountability, a CAB official said.         
	While the availability of the ICL players was supposed to improve the teams performance, it has, in fact, only complicated matters.         
	The leadership is in doubt What happens in the dressing room comes out in the open. The players are in a dilemma, said the official.         
	Bengal are likely to rest some senior players against Orissa on Friday and will try out the reserve bench. Accordingly Rohan, Deep Dasgupta, Ranadeb Bose and Iresh Saxena may have to sit out.         
	Roger Binny, the Bengal coach, said that his bowlers did not bowl according to plan on Thursday. They bowled a negative line when we should have attacked more. After all we were defending a meagre 95, he said.         
	So what is the Bengal selection committee chairman Sambaran Banerjee thinking post the Dhanbad debacle? Unfortunate was all he would say.         
	It has been learnt that Sambaran will have an informal meeting with former India skipper Sourav Ganguly and look for answers. Surely they will find difficult to find one.

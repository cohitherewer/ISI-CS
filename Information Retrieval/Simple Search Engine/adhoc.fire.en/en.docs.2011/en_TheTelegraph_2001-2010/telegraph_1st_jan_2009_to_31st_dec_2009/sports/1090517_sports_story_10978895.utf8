                                                     Rajasthan Royals eye last-four spot
          
	Bloemfontein: Defending champions Rajasthan Royals would look to set one foot on the semi-final spot with a win against a wounded Delhi DareDevils in their Indian Premier League match here Sunday, boosted by the remarkable come-from-behind victory over the Mumbai Indians.         
	Thanks to their thrilling two-run victory over the Mumbai Indians on Thursday, the Shane Warne-led side are third on the IPL table with 13 points and they need a win to get their nose ahead as five teams chase the three semi-final berths.         
	On the other hand, the DareDevils, who have already made it to the semi-finals with 16 points from 11 matches, would want to return to winning ways ahead of the semi-finals. The DareDevils strong batting line-up crumbled against Brett Lee and Co. of Kings XI Punjab, but that is unlikely to happen every other day.         
	Warne led the team from the front in their victory against the Mumbai Indians. He will have to inspire other bowlers if they are to restrict the DareDevils to a low total.         
	Pacers Kamran Khan and Amit Singh are unavailable due to their suspect bowling action but Warne can have faith in Munaf Patel, who denied the DareDevils four runs from the last over by taking a wicket and effecting two run-outs.         
	In the batting department, Rob Quineys return among runs up the order against the Mumbai team was an encouraging sign, but Graeme Smiths form remains a big concern and Warne would be looking towards the South African skipper to fire against Delhi on Sunday. Young Ravindra Jadeja has been the lone spark in Rajasthan Royals shaky middle-order         
	Their opponents, on the other hand, would want to bounce back from their timid show against the Kings XI. (PTI)

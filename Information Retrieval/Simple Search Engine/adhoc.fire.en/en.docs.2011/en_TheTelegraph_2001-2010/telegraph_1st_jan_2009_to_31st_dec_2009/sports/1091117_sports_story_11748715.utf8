                                                                                                                                   Sukhwinder: Boys can deliver   goods 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Four years after he was unceremoniously thrown out by the All India Football Federation (AIFF), Sukhwinder Singh started his third stint as the national coach when the camp for the SAFF Cup kicked off in Goa on Monday.         
	Mainly comprising under-23 players, Sukhwinder has been given a bunch of youngsters to regain the title at Dhaka that India lost in 2008 in Colombo. India had a full strength side under Bob Houghton that struggled to beat Bhutan before bowing to Maldives in the final.         
	Except Sushil Singh, all other campers are freshers in the national team. Though a few of them like Arindam Bhattacharya, Govin Singh, Jagpreet Singh and Baldeep Singh have been attending the camp under Houghton for the past couple of years, they are yet to play in an official competition.         
	Sukhwinder, remained unperturbed by the apparent lack of experience in the squad. These boys are good and talented. I am sure they can deliver the goods, he said.         
	SAFF Cup is always tough for India as they are expected to win. The problem is that anything less than a victory in SAFF would be considered a failure, said the seasoned coach.         
	Five players, Sukhwinder said, were yet to join the camp. While Mohun Bagan midfielder Manish Mathani was expected to arrive later in the day, Gurpreet Singh, Jeje Lalpeklua, Subodh Kumar and Lalrindika were busy doing duty with the India under-19 team in Iraq where they registered a 3-0 win over Kuwait in an inconsequential outing.         
	THE SQAUD         
	Goalkeepers: Arindam Bhattacharya (Churchill), Laxmikant Kattimani (Dempo), Gurpreet Singh (Haryana); Defenders: Denzil Franco (Mahindra), Govin Singh (East Bengal), Nirmal Chetri (East Bengal), N Mohan Raj (Mohun Bagan), Noaba Singh (Churchill), Rowlison Rodrigues (Churchill), Raju Gaikwad (TFA), Robert L (Churchill), Survinder Singh (Air India); Midfielders: Jagpreet Singh (JCT), Baldip Singh (JCT), Baljit Sahni (JCT), Balwant Singh (JCT), Jibbon Singh (TFA), Jewel Raja (Dempo), Joaquim Abranches (Dempo) and Manish Mathani (Mohun Bagan); Forwards: CS Sabeeth (Viva Kerala), Sushil Singh (Mahindra), Jagtar Singh (TFA), Subhash Singh ( East Bengal), Jeje Lalpeklua (Pune FC).

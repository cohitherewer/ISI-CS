                                                   Cakewalk for Bayern vs EB
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Fight to the last second, never give up. That is one of the innate qualities of German soccer but Bayern Munichs under-23 team didnt need to exert themselves much as they won 1-0 against a second-string East Bengal side at Barasat on Saturday.         
	The visitors skill, power and precision were on full display in a match East Bengal took as an opportunity to test their reserve bench. Bayern Munich struck as early as the second minute after Yilmaz scored with a deft placement from the right side of the penalty box.         
	They squandered another couple of gilt-edged opportunities with Yilmaz and Schurf being the worst offenders in the second session.         
	It was a chance to judge the fitness of players who are just back from injuries It will help me in assessing their condition before the second phase of the I-League, said Subhas Bhowmick after the 70-minute encounter.         
	Bayern Munich played well but we too lived up to the challenge. I wanted to test our youngsters technically and physically against the reputed side and I am quite satisfied, Bhowmick added.         
	The East Bengal coach hasnt made up his mind about fielding the players who are just back from national duty in the second practice match on Monday.         
	The Bayern Munich youngsters enthralled the handful of spectators with better passing, speed, co-ordination, anticipation and distribution.         
	The stronger physiques of the visitors often worked to their advantage.         
	Besides Yilmaz, Thomas Mueller impressed with his allround skill.         
	The 19-year-old Mueller has scored nine goals in the Regionalliga (third division of German league) for the team.         
	Having wrested early control of the midfield, they never let the advantage slip. At times, as many as eight of their players made inroads into the rival penalty box and the home team struggled to keep them in check.         
	East Bengal started with Syed Rahim Nabi in defence but pushed him upfront in the second session. The move, however, had no impact as he struggled to get past the rival stopper backs. In fact, very few home team players got noticed in the match.         
	East Bengals best chance was wasted by Goutam Kujur midway through the second half.         
	East Bengal felicitated Gerd Muller during the half-time.         
	The team will end their trip with the third practice match against Siliguri Mayors XI on Wednesday.

                                                   Greg created doubts in our minds: Bhajji
                      
	New Delhi: India spinner Harbhajan Singh on Tuesday lashed out at Greg Chappell, accusing the former India coach of browbeating players and putting doubts in their mind.         
	Harbhajan said Chappell, during his tumultuous two-year tenure, refused to listen to players and created self-doubt among the cricketers.         
	(Under him) our mind was not working properly. He put a lot of doubts in my mind and in other players as well... That you know you are not good enough... Harbhajan told a television channel. Lot of things were happening and we were not happy with lot of things, he said.         
	He (Chappell) just wanted to say whatever he felt and didnt want to listen. (PTI)

                  Rohit Sharma in action   on Wednesday                     
	Cape Town: Adam Gilchrist and Rohit Sharma lit up Newlands Stadium with their batting pyrotechnics as Deccan Chargers thumped Bangalore Royal Challengers by 24 runs for their second straight win in the Indian Premier League here Wednesday.         
	On a perfect day, the Deccan Chargers did everything right  from winning the toss, posting an imposing 184 for six and then restricting their opponents to 160 for eight for a facile victory.         
	For the Bangalore side, Virat Kohli (50 off 32 balls) and Rahul Dravid (48 off 27 balls) tried their best but that was just not enough to chase down the highest score of the tournament, built around the blistering half-centuries from Gilchrist (71) and Rohit (52).         
	A solid start was a pre-requisite to such a herculean chase but Bangalore Royal Challengers had a rather ominous beginning with Fidel Edwards disturbing Jesse Ryders furniture with the first delivery of the innings.         
	Second ball duck in the first match, dropped from the second game and a golden duck today  Ryders nightmare simply showed no signs of ending.         
	Jacques Kallis (15) too failed to do justice to his reputation, that too in front of his home crowd, and fell to RP Singh, while Robin Uthappa (12) was spectacularly caught by Ravi Teja off Scott Styris.         
	Whatever hopes Bangalore still had simply evaporated when Pragyan Ojha had Kevin Pietersen (11) stumped in the first over after the strategy-break and from there on, it was just a matter of reducing the defeat margin.         
	Earlier, Deccan Chargers got off to a flier with captain Gilchrist leading from the front to vindicate his decision to bat first at Newlands Sahara Park. Gilchrist may have retired from international cricket but there was no rust in his batting to suggest so. He started with three successive boundaries off Praveen Kumar and when Dale Steyn came from the other end, Gilchrist smote two fours before hitting the final ball of the over out of the park.         
	Herschelle Gibbs (13) fell early to Praveen but not that it had much of an effect on Gilchrist and Kallis was the next in the firing line as the Australian hit him down the ground for a six and followed it up with a four. Gilchrist heaped praise on his deputy Rohit and said the youngster from Mumbai is a class act and is destined for more glory.         
	He has been in great form last year as well and has done pretty well in the Indian one-day and Twenty20 teams. He is a class act, Gilchrist said. Rohit has taken his vice-captains role very seriously and wants to be a leader some day and that is exciting, Gilchrist said.         
	We played really well and its our second win on the trot. But its still too early to think about anything else. Im really happy that the hard work put in by the boys are paying off, said the left-hander.

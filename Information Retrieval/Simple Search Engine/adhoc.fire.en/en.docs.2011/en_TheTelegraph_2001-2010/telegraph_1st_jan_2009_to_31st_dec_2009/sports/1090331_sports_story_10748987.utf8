                                                   Gambhir the 2nd Wall: Sehwag
                      
	Napier: Indias stand-in captain Virender Sehwag insists that neither him nor his teammates ever feared losing the second Test to the Black Caps.         
	Sehwag said that Indian batting, which failed to live up to expectations in the first innings, was too good to falter twice and the players were pretty much sure of saving the match despite conceding the huge 314-run first innings lead to the hosts.         
	We were confident of saving the match. We have a good batting line-up. With (V.V.S.) Laxman, (Rahul) Dravid, (Gautam) Gambhir, (Sachin) Tendulkar we were very sure that we can bat through two-and-a-half days, Sehwag said.         
	We have done that a couple of times earlier also. We did that against Australia in 2001, we did that in Adelaide in 2004, when we won the game, he added.         
	Sehwag said the series wins at home and abroad in the recent months have given Team India the confidence to come out of any difficult situation. In the last seven months, we have won every single Test series.         
	We are getting used to this. We are playing good cricket and we are backing ourselves. It doesnt matter what situation we are in, we just play our game.         
	We are not bothered about the conditions and the wicket. We are just in our own space. We can do what we want to do, the 30-year old Sehwag said.         
	Praising Gambhir for leading Indias fightback with a marathon 137, Sehwag described the left-hander as the second wall of Indian cricket.         
	I think Gautam played the innings of his lifetime, because we hardly have players who have played for almost 11 hours. He is the one who saved the game for us. I think we can call him the second wall of the Indian cricket team, and this one comes from North, Sehwag said.         
	Sehwag was introspective about Indias first innings when the visitors, replying to New Zealands mammoth 619 for nine declared, folded for 305.         
	When the opposition makes 600, you feel that it is a very good batting wicket and you can play shots.         
	But sometimes you can be dismissed because of over-confidence. Some of our batsmen who were set and got fifty got out. There wasnt a single batsman who fell to a good ball, everyone fell to a bad ball, Sehwag said.         
	Incidentally, Sehwag, who also failed with the bat said he was not disappointed with his form.         
	I am not disappointed. Because sometimes you get runs, sometimes you dont. I am pretty happy. I am a team man and we have saved the Test, Sehwag, who led in the absence of an injured Mahendra Singh Dhoni said.         
	According to Sehwag, Dhoni would undergo a fitness test on Wednesday for the third Test starting in Wellington from Friday.         
	Admitting that the McLean Park track was too difficult to bowl a side out, Sehwag said: It was a flat track with nothing for the bowlers except for the bounce.         
	But when the wicket has bounce, its good for batsmen also. They can play their shots, thats why you have seen four or five hundreds in this match. (PTI)

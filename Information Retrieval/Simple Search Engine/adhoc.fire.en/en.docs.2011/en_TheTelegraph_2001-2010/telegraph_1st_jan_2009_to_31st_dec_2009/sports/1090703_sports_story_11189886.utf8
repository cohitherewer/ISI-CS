The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team spirit high, says Ramdin 
                                                     Team spirit high, says Ramdin 
          
	Gros Islet: Denesh Ramdin, the vice-captain of the West Indies, said his teammates realise the importance of Fridays encounter against India and would do whatever it takes to win the penultimate tie of the four-match ODI series.         
	Aware that whichever side wins on Sunday would be spared the ignominy of a series defeat, Ramdin said confidence is not a problem with the West Indies since they crushed India by eight wickets to level the series 1-1 in Kingston.         
	This is a very big weekend for us. We squared the series and it is very important that we win on Friday. Im confident and the team is confident, Ramdin said after the teams practice session at the Beausejour Stadium here.         
	Ramdin reckoned beating India would not be easy but said the West Indies were clicking as a team and was high on self-belief.         
	It is a case of two good teams playing against each other and we expect two very competitive matches. We have been batting well and the bowlers did extremely well in the second match.         
	Everyone is doing their part and we believe in ourselves and in each other, the 24-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman said.

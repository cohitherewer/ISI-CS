The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mandela talk driving Lewis in hour of need
                                                   Mandela talk driving Lewis in hour of need
            Edward Gorman                            
	Sakhir: In his hour of need Lewis Hamilton, Britains out-of-sorts Formula One world champion, has turned to one of his great heroes, Nelson Mandela, for inspiration.         
	Hamilton has been like a bear with a sore head since being exposed as having lied to the stewards at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix and he is smarting from criticism of his attempt to apologise publicly, after he appeared to blame his conduct on a team manager at McLaren Mercedes who has since been sacked.         
	A week ago in China, Hamilton was spitting tacks at the briefest of press calls. In Bahrain, after two sessions of practice that mirrored those in Shanghai, with him running fastest in the first session but back in eleventh place in the afternoon, he seemed in a slightly better mood as he prepared for Sundays Grand Prix.         
	He tried to deflect suggestions that he is going through a personal trauma and the darkest days of his career, but he was asked if he felt the experience of the past three weeks had made him stronger. Definitely, he replied, before going on to recall meeting Mandela at the former South African Presidents 90th birthday celebrations in June last year. Im growing all the time. Im not moaning. I was just saying the other day that when I met Nelson Mandela, he said that, at 90 years old, hes still learning and, in Formula One, Im going to learn every day of my life.         
	Among the great revolutionary-turned-peacemakers famous aphorisms is that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb. This simple lesson of life is one that Hamilton has been learning all too painfully as his career has veered wildly from the joy of winning the World Championship last year to the ignominy of being caught cheating at the start of this season.         
	The damage to him and to his team as a result of this latest storm to darken his horizon is not fully known because McLaren will face the FIAs World Motor Sport Council in Paris on Wednesday, when the case will be formally reviewed. The governing body has made it clear that Hamilton will not face further individual sanction after being stripped of his points in Melbourne and having made his apology, but the team could yet face anything from a fine to suspension from this years championship.         
	The Briton claimed that he is not thinking about what may or may not happen in Paris, even if he knows that it could put the final nail in the coffin of a stuttering title defence. Instead he is concentrating on trying to improve his uncompetitive MP4-24 race car and drawing strength from his family. Ah, I cant be defeated mentally, he remarked. Its not a problem for me focusing. I go home, I recharge. I have my family here the whole time, so as long as I have them, I will keep fighting. I am feeling better and better as every day goes by, and more prepared.         
	When discussing the car, which Martin Whitmarsh, the team principal, has conceded is suffering from a shortage of development work because of the effort the team put into last years machine, Hamilton appeared to suggest that the day may not be far off when the team might have to abandon this years model and concentrate on building a better one for next season. A similar suggestion was made recently as a possible strategy for Ferrari by Michael Schumacher when asked about the Scuderias off-the-pace 2009 challenger.         
	I think the World Championship is still on but the other guys are quite a bit ahead, Hamilton said. But I guess anything can happen in 14 races so we remain optimistic and keep doing the best job we can. If we can catch up, we will catch up. If not, we will do the best job we can and focus on next season.

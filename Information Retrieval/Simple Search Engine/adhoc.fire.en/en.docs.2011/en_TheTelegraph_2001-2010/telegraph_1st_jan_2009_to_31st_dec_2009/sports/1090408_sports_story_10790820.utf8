The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karim blames it on silly mistakes 
                                                   Karim blames it on silly mistakes 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A dejected Karim Bencharifa blamed Tuesdays 0-1 loss to Al Kuwait SC on his boys failure to win the duels against their Kuwaiti counterparts. We lost almost 90 per cent of the duels against them. That was crucial. Its important to win the 50-50 balls during a match and failure to do that cost us the game, he said.         
	He was all praises for his opponents saying: Their back-four was excellent. They were simply solid.         
	But he was quick to point to the lack of attacking edge in his team. We didnt penetrate enough. I was pretty disappointed with the way we let in the goal. Some silly mistakes did us in, said the Moroccan.         
	Karim criticised the refereeing saying that the official should have been stricter in the last 15-20 minutes when the visitors hampered the game with time-wasting tactics.         
	Laurand Banide, the Al Kuwait coach, sounded satisfied with the result. I am happy with our performance. I expected to take a point, but a win is very good. We were lucky to get full points. We have a good chance in the tournament said the Frenchman.

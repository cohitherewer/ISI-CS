                                                   Bangla eye a historic first
                      
	St Georges (Grenada): Bangladesh will go into the second and final Test against the West Indies starting Friday at the Queens Park Stadium Complex knowing that they are on the verge of making history.         
	The visitors need only a draw to fulfil a long-cherished dream of a first Test series victory after they took a 1-0 lead with a 95-run victory in the opening Test at St Vincent.         
	But celebrations have been tempered by a knee injury to their new captain Mashrafe Mortaza which is likely to sideline him for the match.         
	Mortaza fell clumsily on his right knee while bowling in the first Test, and spent the last two and a half days off the field. He underwent a medical scan on Tuesday, and although the results of the test are not as worrisome as initially feared, the visitors do not want to risk long-term injury to their spearhead.         
	The Tigers have flown in Nazmul Hossain as back up for Mortaza, but, if the first Test is any indication, the team might, after all, not miss their captain.         
	It was Bangladeshs spinners who made life difficult for the West Indies batsmen in the first Test, particularly the second innings, when Mahmudullah and Shakib Al Hasan  who is likely to lead in Mortazas absence  dominated.         
	The Tigers will consider playing three spinners with Mehrab Hossain, Jr the likely choice to fill the vacancy, particularly if the pitch looks favourable.         
	Given that they arrived in the Caribbean as rank outsiders, winning the series will be very important to Bangladesh.         
	Fortune favoured them when the long-running feud between the West Indies Cricket Board and the West Indies Players Association (WIPA) escalated prior to the opening Test, and the leading West Indies players decided to boycott the series forcing the hosts to field a hodgepodge side with limited Test and international experience.         
	This meant Bangladeshs chances of a Test victory  and perhaps even a Test series victory  were enhanced.         
	The visitors held their nerve through a batting collapse in the first innings, and then a solid, if not formidable West Indies reply, and sealed the Test in the second half of the match.         
	Since the dispute between the West Indies board and the players continues, the home team will again field a weakened line-up for the second Test. The batting has been boosted with the addition of Ryan Hinds, one of the leading batsmen in last seasons first-class competition.         
	Hinds played the last of his 14 Tests against England in March this year at Trinidads Queens Park Oval, but he is yet to make his mark at the top level.         
	The left-hander managed just 91 runs in four Tests against England on their recent Caribbean tour and was dropped for the return trip in May.         
	He has become the third player who has represented the Caribbean side in recent months to ignore the WIPA stand, following similar decisions by Dave Bernard, Jr and Darren Sammy.         
	Kraigg Brathwaite and Andre Creary, two under-19 players who had been included in the squad for the first Test, have been released, and will return to Jamaica to take part in the West Indies youth championship.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tamil Nadu can trouble the Goans 
                                                   Tamil Nadu can trouble the Goans 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                       
	Chennai: Tamil Nadu do not want to let go this opportunity. An opportunity to win the Santosh Trophy title for the first time, and that too in front of home crowds. Santosh Trophy for states like Tamil Nadu means a lot.         
	Chennai clubs do not have a regular presence in the I-League and this tournament gives them a chance to assert regional supremacy, a chance to taunt those big guns.         
	No wonder, Tamil Nadu this time have formed a strong enough team to give the likes of Goa and Bengal a run for their money.         
	Bengal got a taste of Tamil Nadus zeal when they were held to a 1-1 draw in the quarter final league match.         
	And in Thursdays second semi-final, it will be Goas turn to meet the home favourites.         
	Tamil Nadu have already scored 34 goals in the tournament  that includes 30 in the cluster matches  and their frontliners, P. Muthu and P.C. Riju, are in great form. Muthu, for the record, scored a hattrick against Manipur that took the team to the last four.         
	The 32-year-old striker has caught the eye of Mohun Bagan and is likely to be seen in the green and maroon jersey next season.         
	Tamil Nadu have a very good side. And they will get home advantage. We have our task cut out, said Goa defender Mahesh Gawli.         
	But Gawli is not worried that this young Goan side might not be able to match Tamil Nadu.         
	The India defender, playing his last Santosh Trophy, said that Goa had enough ammunition to thwart the onslaught.         
	We are peaking at the right time. We did not play well in the cluster matches but once the quarter final league got under way we started to get into the groove, Gawli said.         
	Goa on Thursday will be missing Freddy Mascarenhas and Joaquim Abranches due to injury. Freddy scored a brace in their last quarter final match against Maharashtra which Goa won 5-0.         
	The highlight of that inconsequential match was Marcus Mascarenhass hattrick. He is one for the future. A great talent, Gawli said.         
	Well, to make Gawlis last Santosh Trophy memorable, the onus will be on this young Sesa Goa striker to deliver.         
	Kick-off: 5.30pm.

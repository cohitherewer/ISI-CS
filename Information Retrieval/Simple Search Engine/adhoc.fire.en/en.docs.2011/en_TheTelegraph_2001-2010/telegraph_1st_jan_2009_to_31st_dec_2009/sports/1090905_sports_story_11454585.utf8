                                                   Diegos boys desperate for win
                      
	Buenos Aires: Argentina coach Diego Maradona is predicting a victory over Brazil in Saturdays critical World Cup qualifying match. Without it, bad things could start to unfold for a team struggling to reach next years tournament in South Africa.         
	With a loss, Maradona will face even more pressure from some of the worlds most demanding football fans, many of whom have already questioned his tactical acumen. And the tension will mount going into another taxing match next week, when Argentina play in Paraguay, who lead the Argentines in the qualifying standings.         
	Were going to win because we have better players, Maradona said.         
	Its unlikely the Brazilians need added motivation against their biggest rivals, but if so, they have got it. Brazil are in much better shape, and with another stumble, two-time world champions Argentina face the possibility of missing their first World Cup since 1970.         
	Maradona will probably team Messi up front with Carlos Tevez, who has the edge on Atletico Madrid striker Sergio Aguero  Maradonas son-in-law.         
	If Brazil win the match, they may clinch their spot in South Africa. Brazil will qualify if they win, Colombia beat Ecuador and Uruguay fail to win against Peru.         
	Meanwhile, a little more than nine months before the World Cup begins, all but six of the 32 teams are still to be decided. So far, Japan, Australia, North and South Korea and the Netherlands have captured places alongside hosts South Africa in the December 4 draw at Cape Town, although several more teams are banging on the door.         
	While Spain and England look set to join them soon, other powerhouses have plenty of work to do. Three-time champions Germany are at the top of their group, but second-placed Russia appear almost certain to cut Germanys lead to one point by beating Liechtenstein at home on Saturday. With only the group winners sure of World Cup places from European qualifying, there is still a strong chance that Guus Hiddinks Russians can catch the Germans, who host South Africa in a friendly on Saturday.         
	Italy also top their group and are out to capture three points in Georgia on Saturday. But Marcello Lippis team have only a one-point lead over Ireland  who are guided by another Italian coaching great, Giovanni Trapattoni  who visit Cyprus.         
	France have five points to make up on leaders Serbia in Group 7, although Raymond Domenechs team, who host Romania on Saturday, have a game in hand on the leaders and soon go to Belgrade. It will be hard, but the message Im getting across to the players is that it will be just as hard (for Romania and Serbia), Domenech said. We have a talented and a strong team, and well show it.         
	Slovakia are the surprise leaders of Group 3 as they chase a first World Cup appearance, and have a great chance to push neighbours the Czech Republic further out of contention by beating them at home on Saturday.         
	Portugal badly need a victory over Group 1 leaders Denmark in Copenhagen or Cristiano Ronaldo and his teammates will probably have to start thinking about the runners up playoffs.         
	With four rounds of games to go, group favourites Portugal and Sweden are lingering well behind the Danes and Hungary. Denmark have 16 points and Hungary 13 with Portugal and Sweden on nine.         
	With the Hungarians hosting Sweden on Saturday, two home wins will push the Portuguese and the Swedes further out of contention for places in the finals.         
	England, who host Slovenia in a friendly on Saturday, will capture a place at the finals if they beat Croatia at Wembley on Wednesday to make it eight wins out of eight in Group 6. That means the race is effectively for second place and a playoff spot, which Croatia are favoured to capture, especially by beating fourth-placed Belarus on Saturday.         
	Three points behind the Croats, third-placed Ukraine have a game in hand, however, and should also beat Andorra at home to stay in contention. With six wins from six games, Spain should move closer to the finals by beating Belgium at home, while second-placed Bosnia-Herzegovina are hopeful of staying in contention by winning in Armenia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Velappan hits out at Hammam
                                                   Velappan hits out at Hammam
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Former Asian Football Confederation (AFC) general secretary Peter Velappan said Wednesday that the AFC president Mohamed Bin Hammam was constantly working against the interest of Indian football.         
	Known for his controversial remarks, Velappan is currently in India to campaign for Bahrain football federation chairman Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, the man who has decided to challenge Bin Hammam in the upcoming elections for the Fifa executive post from Asia.         
	The elections will be held in Kuala Lumpur on May 8.         
	Velappan, who ruled AFC for 28 years before being ousted by Hammam, said: Hammam never liked the All India Football Federation (AIFF) people. That was the reason he derailed Fifas Win in India with India project.         
	Calling Hammam a dictator, Velappan alleged that Fifa was eager to deal directly with AIFF on the Win in India with India project but was stopped from doing so by Hammam.         
	He didnt allow anyone to accelerate the pace of the Vision India project, Velappan said. In five years it could have achieved a lot, but didnt. The AFC didnt support it at all.         
	Hammam, once touted as a future Fifa president, visited India last month to campaign for his candidature. Though his deep pockets and big promises helped him become the AFC president in 2002, Hammam, at the moment is certainly fighting hard for survival.         
	Ebrahim al-Khalifa, who was in Delhi on Tuesday, is mainly banking on support from the east Asian and dissatisfied Gulf nations.         
	Velappan claimed Ebrahim al-Khalifa had considerable support from member associations to be able to stop Hammam from representing AFC at the Fifa Congress.         
	The May 8 election assumes significance owing to a comment, from Hammam that he would resign from the AFC presidents post if he loses his Fifa seat.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kubica looks beyond the track
                                                   Kubica looks beyond the track
                      
	Valencia: Snooker, poker and bowling are all weapons in Robert Kubicas armoury as he girds himself for the noise and fury of a full-on Formula One title battle this season.         
	The lanky Pole, who briefly led the championship last year after giving his BMW-Sauber team a first win in Canada, believes they offer him just what he needs to recharge his batteries.         
	They dont compare with Formula One at all, he said in a team interview before the launch of the new F1.09 car in Valencia.         
	Thats why I like them. In my job I spend a lot of time with a lot of action, high speed and noise. By contrast, poker and bowling are quite steady, added the Krakow driver, who once listed snooker player Ronnie Sullivan as his sporting hero.         
	You dont have to put in too much effort.         
	Especially when I am bowling, I can completely switch off my brain and relax. During the winter break I took part in some tournaments. I have some friends who play at a very high level in Europe, I really enjoy playing with them.         
	Kubica, the first Polish driver in Formula One, was a contender for much of last season and his rivals know that he means business providing BMW can maintain the pace of development.         
	I joined in 2006 when the team was completely new and during 2006 and 2007 we have improved a lot, he told reporters after giving the new car its track debut.         
	I think we have kept up the pace with the top teams on development. (REUTERS)

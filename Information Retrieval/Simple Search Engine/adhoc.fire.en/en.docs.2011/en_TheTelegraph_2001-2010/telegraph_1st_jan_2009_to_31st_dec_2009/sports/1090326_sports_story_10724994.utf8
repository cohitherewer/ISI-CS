	PC Thulasi, qualifier Ashwini Ponnappa and Sampada Sahastrabuddhe were the other Indian women who reached the pre-quarter finals.         
	Saina, up against a lesser known Chew Yen, did not give an inch away and was on top of her rival right from the start.         
	The World No. 9 played close to the nets and made her opponent dance to her tune. In the first game Chew tried to go neck and neck initially and came as close as 7-5, but then Saina just raced away with the game pocketing it 21-6.         
	In the second game, the Malaysian pocketed a couple of early points but could not make much headway as Saina cruised her way to first take the lead at 7-5 and then sealed the match 21-10. Saina later said the match was much tougher than the scoreline suggests. It wasnt an easy match. There were a lot of long rallies and I attacked more. There was drift in the air in the second game but I managed it well. I didnt hit it in the direction of the drift and played some sharp strokes, Saina said.         
	This is an important win as it will set the momentum and now that I know the court better, I hope to win the next match, she added. (PTI)

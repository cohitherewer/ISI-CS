                                                   Batting Indias main concern
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Taunton: India will have to quickly sort out their batting woes if they want to surprise formidable England in the their inaugural ICC Womens World Twenty20 opening match here Thursday.         
	In the days other game, South Africa take on the West Indies.         
	Hosts England are the 50-over World Cup winners but with the Twenty20 format new to all the teams, Jhulan Goswamis side can fancy upsetting the tournament favourites.         
	The Indians, who have played just two T20 Internationals, finished third in the ODI World Cup in March and they did not have the best of the build-ups to the tournament with a 17-run loss to New Zealand here Tuesday in their only warm-up game.         
	Skipper Jhulan Goswami was confident that her side had the wherewithal to be among the top sides in the tournament. You need to play with your mind. If youre mentally strong you can beat (any team) and we are confident about ourselves, she said.         
	Goswami will depend a lot on her two senior-most teammates  Anjum Chopra and Mithali Raj  to soar up the batting which could not chase down 124 against New Zealand Tuesday.         
	Both former captains, Chopra and Raj had played 116 and 115 ODIs and they have vast experience of playing in England, though they are also new to Twenty20 having played just one and two Internationals respectively.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Problems off the field for Bengal
                                                                                                                       7                                        Problems off the field for Bengal
            A STAFF REPORTER            Deep Dasgupta                           
	Calcutta: The shoddy on-field performance of the senior Bengal team is taking its toll off the field, too. Matters have reached such a state that the squad for their fourth Super League (Group B) Ranji Trophy encounter against Saurashtra, which is scheduled to start at the Eden from Tuesday, will be announced less than 24 hours before the match.         
	It will not be easy for Bengal to contain the in-form Cheteswar Pujara (scored double hundred against Maharashtra), Ravindra Jadeja and Sitanshu Kotak (both centurions).         
	Its a tough match. We need to get full points from this match to stay ahead, Sourav Ganguly said after practice on Sunday.         
	Bengals problems are manifold. Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Rohan Gavaskar and Rohan Banerjees fitness is an area of concern for the team management. Deep Dasguptas unwillingness to play any more this season and manager Russi Jeejeebhoys report on how Manoj Tiwary was made the captain despite instructions from the CAB to appoint Deep, will hog the limelight. Jeejeebhoy has already submitted his report to the CAB.         
	We need to sort out the pending issues before we can announce the final 15 for the match. Since it is our home match, we are not really perturbed. Moreover, coach Roger Binny will be arriving on Sunday night. We also want him to be present at the meeting. Since all these issues couldnt have been solved by Sunday, we decided to postpone it by a day, joint secretary Biswarup Dey said.         
	The three players will take a fitness test on Sunday. Rohan is confident of passing the test. Young Banerjee is also likely to be fit. Deep may put forward his case before the CAB president on Sunday. If the president is able to convince him, and if the trio are declared fit, Arindam Das is set to get the boot.

	Calcutta: Patrick Quinns ward Forces Of Destiny took his six rivals by surprise on way to an easy victory in the RCTC New Years Trophy, the main attraction in the eight-event card on Thursday, the Day I of the winter season. The winner, however, had to win the race again in the stewards room following a dual objection lodged by jockeys D. Ashish and C. Alford who occupied minor placings.          
	A crowd of nearly thirteen thousand packed the RCTCs stands on the New Years Day, in spite of some negative publicity by a section of media following the outbreak of an unidentified kind of Equine fever which affected all horses in the RCTCs stables. The start of the winter season had to be delayed by nearly two months because of it.

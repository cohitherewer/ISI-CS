The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin to Karthiks defence
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sachin to Karthiks defence
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Calcutta: With Dinesh Karthik apparently being low on morale after getting the stick from many quarters for not allowing Sachin Tendulkar to post his 46th ODI century, in Cuttack, on Monday, the maestro has himself come out in the wicketkeeper-batsmans defence.         
	In a statement made available to The Telegraph on Wednesday evening, Sachin said: I myself told Karthik to play his natural game and to go for his shots I also said that he shouldnt worry about my getting a hundred as, if it had to happen, then it would.         
	Sachin, it may be recalled, was left stranded on 96 as Team India thrashed Sri Lanka by seven wickets to take a 2-1 lead in the five-match series.         
	The fourth ODI, in the city, is on Thursday.

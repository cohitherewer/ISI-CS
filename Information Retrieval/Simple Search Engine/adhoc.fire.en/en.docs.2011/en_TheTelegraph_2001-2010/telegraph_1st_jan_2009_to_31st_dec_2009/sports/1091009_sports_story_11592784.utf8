                                                     DareDevils look for a head start
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Gautam Gambhir                           
	New Delhi: All eyes will be on Delhi DareDevils Virender Sehwag and his quest for a return to form when the franchise take on Australias Victoria Bushrangers in their Airtel Champions League T20 opener at the Kotla Friday.         
	Sehwag, who has been troubled by a shoulder injury, made a comeback leading Rest of India in the Irani Trophy at Nagpur but a viral infection kept him out of action for most part of the match.         
	With the series against Australia round the corner, the dashing opener would be keen to get back to form as soon as possible.         
	I am raring to go, said Sehwag, who has been training with the team for two days now.         
	A final decision on his availability for the match, however, will be taken Friday.         
	If Sehwag is the star member for the DareDevils, the Victoria challenge will come from opener Brad Hodge, regarded as one of the best T20 players in the world.         
	Apart from Hodge, Victoria have players like Cameron White and David Hussey, who have enough ammunition to throw at the home side.         
	DareDevils, on the other hand, are a depleted team in the absence of Paul Collingwood, Daniel Vettori, whose replacement by Yogesh Nagar has been approved by the league technical committee Thursday, and AB de Villiers.         
	The newly-crowned captain, Gautam Gambhir, however, exuded confidence and said his team was still capable of performing well.         
	Asked how it felt leading the team, Gambhir said he was enjoying his new role but was quick to add that a captain was only as good as his team.         
	It also adds to your responsibility.         
	If you are not the leader, you only have your game to think about, but once you are the captain, you have to worry about each and every individual. So its a different challenge but most cricketers want this responsibility.

	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) working committee Tuesday constituted a five-member special committee to follow up on the recommendations of the special general bodys report on the huge expenditure in the first edition of the Indian Premier League by the Prasun Mukherjee-led dispensation.         
	The special general meeting was held on April 11.         
	Former CAB vice-president Dilip Ghosh will be the chairman of the committee that includes Chitrak Mitra, Bablu Ganguly, Biswarup Dey and former BCCI lawyer Ushanath Banerjee. Dey will be the convenor. Besides, approving the bylaws of the P. Sen Trophy, the working committee also formed a co-operative society for the Eden ground staff.         
	Meanwhile, the CAB has obtained a 20-year lease on the Kalyani University ground. According to Dalmiya, the seven-acre Kalyani University ground will be the CABs third ground after the Eden and the Jadavpur Universitys Salt Lake campus ground.

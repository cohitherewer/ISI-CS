The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev slips to tied 24th 
                                                     Jeev slips to tied 24th 
                  Sean Hair                     
	Orlando: Jeev Milkha Singh found the going tough in the third round and stuttered to a four-over 74 to tied 24th at the Arnold Palmer Invitational golf tournament here.         
	The seasoned Indians total stood at three-over 213 after yet another tough and windy day at the $5.8 million event.         
	Off to a disastrous start with a double bogey on the par-four first hole, Jeev managed just one birdie in his front nine, on the third, before dropping strokes on the fourth and seventh to make the turn three-over.         
	The back-nine was no better as he dropped three bogeys against a couple of birdies to end the day over-par. American Sean Hair, meanwhile, stretched his lead to five shots.         
	On a brutal day at Bay Hill where thick rough and gusting winds posed continual problems for the players, Hair carded a one-over-par 71 to tighten his grip on the tournament.         
	The slim 26-year-old returned five bogeys and four birdies for a seven-under total of 203, with five-time champion Tiger Woods lurking ominously in second place after a matching 71.         
	Woods closed to within four of the lead after making two consecutive birdies from the 12th but the world No. 1 slipped back with bogeys on 16 and at the 18.         
	Zach Johnson fired a 68, one of only four sub-par scores on the day, to lie joint third at one under with fellow American Jason Gore (74) and Japans Ryuji Imada (73).         
	For much of the day, it seemed the in-form Hair would shrug off the challenge of thick rough and winds gusting up to 50kph. Three ahead of the chasing pack overnight, he coolly parred the first four holes before rolling in a 15-footer to birdie the fifth and stretch his lead to four.         
	Hair also bogeyed the ninth after finding a greenside bunker with his approach. After calmly saving par with a 14-foot putt at the 10th, he birdied the next three holes. He almost holed out with his approach on 11, two-putted at the par-five 12th and coaxed in a downhill 14-footer at the 13th to forge six ahead.         
	Along with most of his rivals, Hair faltered over the closing stretch. He made his third bogey of the round at the par-four 15th after finding the right rough off the tee and also with his second shot.         
	He also dropped shots on 16, where he missed a five-foot putt, and at the difficult par-four last where he found the back left bunker with his approach. On a day when the average score was 73.459, Woods felt he did not get enough reward for the quality of his own play.

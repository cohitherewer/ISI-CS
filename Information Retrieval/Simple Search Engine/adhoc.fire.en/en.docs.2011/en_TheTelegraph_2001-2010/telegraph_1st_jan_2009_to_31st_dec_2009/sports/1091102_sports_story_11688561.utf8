                                                   Bengal raring to go
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla believes that the team would be able to put up a better show, after a dismal kick-off to the season, when they face Maharashtra in their Ranji Trophy opener, which begins in Pune on Tuesday.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph from Pune, the 28-year old all-rounder said that Bengals lacklustre show in the recently concluded East Zone T20 tournament in Dhanbad, was a matter of the past and that wont affect the teams performance in the Ranji Trophy.         
	Look, we know that it was a very bad performance But its past. We are looking forward. Twenty20 is a different format and we are very hopeful of putting things in the right order, Shukla said.         
	Elaborating further, Shukla said: The boys are more focussed this time. They know the importance of a win in this match and how badly we need a good start. So I am optimistic Things will change for the better.         
	Hailing Maharashtra as a young and competitive side, Shukla predicted a good contest. They are a good side The youngsters, who are quite promising, along with the seniors, make them a complete side. So, I hope it will be a good fight, the captain said.         
	Talking about the ground and pitch conditions, Shukla said: The ground looks fantastic and the pitch also seems to be a very good one. But I think the heavy dew in the morning could to be an important factor I believe it will help both the batsmen and the bowlers.         
	But we will decide our strategy only after seeing the wicket tomorrow (Monday).         
	Ruing the absence of coach Roger Binny, Shukla said: We are missing him a lot... We have heard that he may join us tomorrow (Monday). We are waiting for him, he signed off.

	 Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Wednesday revealed that the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has sought a Rs 25 crore grant for the development of the game in the country.         
	That the AIFF had made such a request was reported by The Telegraph on August 4.

	No Pak tour         
	 Karachi: Zimbabwe Wednesday turned down an invitation to send their under-19 team to Pakistan owing to the volatile security in the country. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said Zimbabwe had security concerns about playing in Pakistan after which it was decided to send the Pakistan under-19 team to the African country later this year.         
	Selection policy         
	Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ejaz Butt has warned against complacency creeping among cricketers and said there is no place for unworthy players in the national side.         
	I want to make it clear that only those players would be considered for the Champions Trophy who deserve to be in the side. There is no place for players not willing to give 100 per cent, Butt said.         
	Anwar role         
	 Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Saeed Anwar is likely to get a key position with the national cricket team after the left-handed opener Wednesday held a discussion with the PCB chairman Ejaz Butt in Lahore.

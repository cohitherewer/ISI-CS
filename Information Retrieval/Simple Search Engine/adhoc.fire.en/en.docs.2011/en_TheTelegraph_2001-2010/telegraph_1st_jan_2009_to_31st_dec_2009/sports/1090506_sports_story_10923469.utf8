	London: England will attempt to avenge their recent series defeat to the West Indies on Wednesday at Lords, but the two-Test series is in danger of being eclipsed by the Indian Premier League and the host nations looming confrontation with Australia.         
	The West Indies have been drafted in to replace Englands original opponents Zimbabwe, who no longer play Test cricket, and then subsequently Sri Lanka for this two-game precursor to the Twenty20 World Cup in June and the Ashes a month later.         
	Where once the arrival of the West Indies would send a tremor of fear around every dressing room in England, there is now a feeling that Chris Gayles side are simply a warm-up act. This at least was the opinion of English fast bowler Stuart Broad, who opted out of the IPL in favour of the superior preparation he felt the West Indies would offer.         
	The Ashes is a major reason that I didnt go to the IPL and a major reason why anyone plays for their country, he told an English daily. You can make history. People have a passion for the Ashes and I think, to the nation, its the most important thing in the cricketing world.         
	Its the pinnacle. Beating the West Indies at home is brilliant but beating Australia gives massive national pride.         
	The attraction of the IPL proved stronger, though, for Gayle. The West Indies captain arrived in Britain just 48 hours before the start of Wednesdays Test, so that he could play an extra game with the Kolkata Knight Riders, a situation described by his coach John Dyson as not ideal.         
	Yet at least Gayle was playing cricket. Of the English contingent at the IPL, Paul Collingwood was only used as a substitute fielder, Kevin Pietersen was erratic and Andrew Flintoff aggravated an injury, ruling him out of the West Indies series  although the British medias fixation with the Ashes ensured the headlines were all about his readiness to face Australia.         
	Only 12,000 tickets have been sold for the opening day at Lords, a venue that can hold double that number. The lukewarm reaction of the England supporters to the West Indies series belies the fact, though, that England were beaten 0-1 when the two sides met in the Caribbean earlier this year.

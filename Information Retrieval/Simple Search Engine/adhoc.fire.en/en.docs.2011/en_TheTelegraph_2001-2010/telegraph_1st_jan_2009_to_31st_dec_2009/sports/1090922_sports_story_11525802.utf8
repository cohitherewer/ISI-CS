	New Delhi: A relaxed Somdev Dev Varman, in the limelight after steering India to the Davis Cup World Group after 11 years, Monday said there is always more pressure on a tennis player when it comes to representing the country at the world team event.         
	Somdev became the toast of the nation Sunday, when he pulled off a sensational comeback win in the playoff tie against South Africa. He overcame a two-set deficit to beat Rik de Voest 3-6, 6-7 (3-7), 7-6 (7-5), 6-2, 6-4 to give India an unassailable 3-1 lead.         
	I did well to fight back. I stayed focused and got motivation from the team. I knew the match was getting physical. I was creating opportunities but I was missing them. Its a Davis Cup match, you are playing for the country, and you feel more pressure, Somdev said in a press meet after returning from Johannesburg.         
	It was a tough match, I was really trying hard but Rik was playing well. I have practised a lot with him and knew his game well, he said.         
	Somdev also said flying early to South Africa helped him a lot as it gave him enough time to acclimatise with the conditions. It was an important tie. The courts were fast and balls were coming quick. So going there early helped me immensely. It was great to peak on Saturday and Sunday and a lot of credit goes to the team as well, he said.         
	Indias non-playing captain S.P. Misra revealed how Somdev pumped himself up after going down in the first two sets. I told Somdev dont lose heart. Keep trying and then he said Ive got heart, Ive got heart, I wanna win it. Somdev is always reliable. It was a match where a lot of expectations were there from him and he gave us the tie, Misra said.         
	He added that Rohan Bopanna made a great contribution to Indias victory by winning the second singles on the opening day. We got a good draw, and luckily Somdev played first, that helped Bopanna play his own game. He responded well after losing the first set, and his victory was key to winning the tie.         
	Asked whether it was time for veterans Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi to pass on the mantle to youngsters, coach Nandan Bal said such a situation was still a way off.         
	Sharing the experience of playing his maiden Davis Cup match, Yuki said he was nervous at the start. It was way different (from playing junior circuit and ITF Futures). I got the opportunity and I wanted to do well. I was nervous in the first couple of games, but after that, I started playing freely, said the 17-year-old.

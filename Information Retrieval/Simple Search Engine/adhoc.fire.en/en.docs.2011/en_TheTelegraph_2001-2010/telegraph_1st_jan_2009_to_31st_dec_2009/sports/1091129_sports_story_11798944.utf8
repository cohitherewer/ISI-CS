            STAR RACER                                      Alford atop Bid For Gold      
	Calcutta: Trainer Darius Byramjis Bid For Gold kept the city owners, D. Khaitans, gold-and-red-belt colours flying while winning the 1,600m Casino Royale Goa Calcutta 1000 Guineas, the first classic of the season held on Saturday. The Placerville-Queen To Conquer daughter made a pillar-to-post attempt and lasted out to beat the two fancied runners from the South  Sans Pareil and Star Bright. C. Alford rode the winner.           
	The afternoon was otherwise ruled by the Mumbai-based trainer Pesi Shroff who saddled four winners  Elegante, Corazon, Rommel and Recardo. Rommels victory, in the 1,600m RWITC Cup, was impressive. The four-year-old horse, ridden by C. Ruzaan, had an easy measure of Fair Option who was considered as a frontline classic contender. RESULTS

	Cardiff: After just two days play at the newest ground in Test cricket, the England and Wales Cricket Board must be wondering what they have let themselves in for.         
	Four-day Tests are a solution to the games ills which has just been floated by the International Cricket Council. A four-day Test match? That would help England escape from Cardiff with a draw, but it is not a good idea for Test cricket as a whole.         
	We need to quicken up pitches not shorten the matches. Unless England bat horribly in their second innings, the only winner of this opening Ashes Test will be the pitch.         
	This pitch has done less and less as the game has gone on, and the batsmen have played better and better. Why, why, why, Delilah? the crowd sang as Simon Katich and Ricky Ponting piled up the runs, but they might as well have sung Why, why, why, Australia? Why are they so tough and patient, rugged and ruthless, and utterly refuse to lie down?         
	Graeme Swann and Englands other tailenders trashed Australias bowling when adding 99 Thursday, reverse-sweeping Nathan Hauritz, forcing misfields, and dismissing pace bowlers. One of the games axioms is that a poor performance in the field leads to a poor batting performance: but Katich and Ponting then drew a line and stopped the rot dead.         
	Swann had a spell of five maidens (was Delilah one of them?), and Andrew Flintoff went at full throttle, but the ball would not swing for England as it had for Australia; and, embarrassing to confess, Englands spinners bowled fewer threatening balls than the much maligned Hauritz.         
	And if this had been a four-day Test, would the Australians have batted any differently? Almost certainly no. Philip Hughes could not have scored any more quickly before lunch, when his high-risk method gave Australia the initiative, ruffled Englands feathers  James Anderson and Stuart Broad were not the penetrators they had been against West Indies  and allowed Katich to bed down for the day and night.         
	If this had been a four-day Test, Australia would have had to take silly risks to score much quicker than they did: this pitch has a little bounce but not of the kind which permits batsmen to drive length balls on the up. Test cricket is the ultimate test of courage, technique and temperament. Lop off a day, set the alarm clock, forbid a side to bat for more than a day, and a Test becomes a different animal  a limited-overs game over four days  which is not such a test of human attributes.         
	A draw, one has to accept, is an integral part of Test. But lifeless pitches should not be accepted. Edges have to carry to slip; more than 11 wickets should fall in the first two days to keep everyone interested. Draws, yes. Stalemates, no.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

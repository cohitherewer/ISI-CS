The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australias top spot under threat
                                                   CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	Australia's top spot under threat   
	Calcutta: There will be more than the Ashes at stake for Ricky Pontings men when they take on England in the final Test at the Oval from Thursday. They have to win to keep their top spot in the Reliance Mobile ICC Test rankings.  
	If Australia win the final Test, they will stay on top but defeat at the Oval could mean slipping to the fourth spot. This would make South Africa No.1, Sri Lanka No.2 and India No.3. Even a draw will mean Australias long reign at the top will come to an end.         
	If Sri Lanka win their series, which starts on Tuesday, against the Black Caps 2-0, they have the opportunity to go second in the rankings. This can happen if Australia lose the final Test, according to an ICC release. However, Sri Lanka could fall to the fourth spot should if they win 1-0 and Australia beat England. On the other hand, if Sri Lanka win the series 1-0 and Australia lose to England, then India would rise above Sri Lanka to book the second place.               
	Paine to join   
	Calcutta: Tim Paine will join the Australian squad Tuesday as reserve wicket-keeper Graham Manou continues his recovery from a hand injury suffered during the third Ashes Test at Edgbaston. Brad Haddin is expected to be fit for selection for the final Test, while Paine will act as a cover for Manou.  
	Board AGM
    
	Mumbai: The BCCIs 80th annual general meeting would be held in Mumbai on September 24. The AGM would be held on September 24. There are no elections scheduled for any post, BCCI sources said.  
	Compensation   
	Mumbai: The winners and runners-up of the inaugural edition of the Indian Premier League, Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings, respectively, have been compensated for the cancelled Champions T20 League in 2008 for which they had qualified.

	Warne view
    
	London: Shane Warne called on Monday for the abolition of 50-over internationals in favour of Twenty20. This is a big call but cricket evolves and the 50-over game is past its sell-by date, Warne wrote in his column. From now on we should be playing Tests and Twenty20 Internationals with a Twenty20 World Cup every two years.

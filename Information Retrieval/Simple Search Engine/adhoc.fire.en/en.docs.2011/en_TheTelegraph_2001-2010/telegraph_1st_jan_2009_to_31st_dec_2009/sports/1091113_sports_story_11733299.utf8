The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shock exit for Roger in Paris
                                                                                                                                   Shock exit for Roger in Paris
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                                Federer      
	Paris: Even after Roger Federer lost his opening match at the Paris Masters on Wednesday evening, with a second-round defeat to Frenchman Julien Benneteau, the world No 49, you suspect that the Swiss will still look back with affection at the time he spent in the city this season.         
	Meanwhile on Thursday, Benneteau lost to Gael Monfils 4-6, 3-6 in the third round.         
	Just five months ago, on the other side of the city on the clay of Roland Garros, Federer won the French Open title for the first time, an accomplishment which completed his Slam colle ction, and confir med his place as the greatest player in history.         
	For all Benneteaus tears, the screams from the crowd, and the fact that this was the first time this season that the world No 1 and Wimbledon champion had lost his opening match at a tournament, this did not feel as if it was even close to being a defining moment of the tennis year.         
	Federer has a fairly average record at this indoor tournament, as he has never gone beyond the quarters, and once more he failed to get to the business end of the week, with Benneteau winning 3-6, 7-6(4), 6-4.         
	When Benneteau served an ace to win the match, he curled up into a ball and started crying, but there was a short interruption to his celebrations as Federer challenged the in call on the Hawk-Eye video-replay system. The reply, though, showed that Benneteaus serve had touched the line, so the call stood, and the crying could resume.         
	Rafael Nadal had earlier taken more than three hours to beat compatriot Nicolas Almagro 3-6, 7-6, 7-5, after staving off five match points in the second set, and then coming back from 3-5 down in the decider.         
	Meanwhile, the Indian challenge in the tournament ended after Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes, along with their respective partners, crashed out in the second-round.         
	Bhupathi and Bahamian Mark Knowles lost 4-6, 7-6 (6), 7-10 to the unseeded Swede-Australian combination of Simon Aspelin and Paul Hanley.         
	Paes and his Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy lost 7-6(5), 4-6, 5-10 to the Australian-American pair of Jordan Kerr and Travis Parrott.

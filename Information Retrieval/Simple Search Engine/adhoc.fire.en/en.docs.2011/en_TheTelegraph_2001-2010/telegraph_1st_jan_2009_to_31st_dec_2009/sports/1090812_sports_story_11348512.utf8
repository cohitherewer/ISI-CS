	Montreal: Rafael Nadals tender knees passed their first test when the Spaniard returned to action on Monday in a doubles win at the Montreal Masters.         
	Sidelined for more than two months with tendonitis in both knees, Nadal looked fighting fit as he teamed up with coach Francisco Roig to beat the Serbian duo of Novak Djokovic and Dusan Vemic 7-5, 6-4.         
	Its great to be back and I had a lot of fun playing with Francisco, Nadal said.         
	A win is a win and doubles is fun and important so I am happy about the way it went today.         
	I am really looking forward to playing singles on Wednesday.         
	It was a positive first step in what is expected to be a testing comeback for the 23-year-old Spaniard, who opens the defence of this Montreal crown with a second round clash against either compatriot David Ferrer or Serb Viktor Troicki.         
	Playing his first event since being stunned in the fourth round of the French Open on May 31, much has changed for Nadal as rival Roger Federer took his French Open and Wimbledon titles along with the world No.1 ranking.         
	Federers life too has undergone some dramatic changes.         
	Since capturing a record 15th Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon in July, Federer and wife Mirka have become parents to twin girls, the Swiss arriving in Montreal with his family in tow.         
	In other first round action, ninth seed Gilles Simon crushed Canadas Frank Dancevic 6-1, 6-2 in a rain-interrupted match to lead a parade of Frenchmen into the second round.         
	Thirteenth seed Gael Monfils made a winning return from a two-month injury layoff battling past former-champion Marat Safin 6-2, 3-6, 6-2.         
	Jeremy Chardy also advanced, rallying past Taiwans Lu Yen-hsun 6-7, 6-3, 6-4 to set up a second round meeting with world No.3 Andy Murray.         
	Paul-Henri Mathieu outlasted Spains Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 7-5, 0-6, 6-1 while Germanys Rainer Schuettler beat Florent Serra to spoil an otherwise perfect day for the French contingent.         
	Russias Mikhail Youzhny provided the only upset on opening day, dispatching 14th seeded Croatian Marin Cilic 4-6, 7-6, 6-1.           (REUTERS)

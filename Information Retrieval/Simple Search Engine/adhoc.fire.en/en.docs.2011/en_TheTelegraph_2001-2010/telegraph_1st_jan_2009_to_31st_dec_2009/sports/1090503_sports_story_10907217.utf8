                                                   Zaheer: Im happy with my progress
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Zaheer Khan, arguably one of the best left-arm swing bowlers in contemporary cricket, says he has put in a lot of hard work and thinking in his bowling.         
	I think I have started putting in a lot of thought into my bowling. All that I am focused is on bowling according to the teams plan, Zaheer was quoted as saying to the Indian Premier Leagues (IPLs) official website. ...These days, when I am bowling I feel as if I am meditating, Zaheer added.         
	Though his incredible form in the last two years has played a big role in Team Indias success, Zaheer feels he has a long way to go to be compared with Pakistan legend Wasim Akram.         
	I am very happy with my progress. But I still feel that I am ways off from being compared to Wasim Akram, said the Mumbai Indian pacer.         
	Talking about his bowling, the 30-year-old Zaheer said: It was Dennis Lillee who inspired me the most. I was fortunate to work under him at the MRF Pace Academy. Its been fun watching all the other bowlers like Akram, Richard Hadlee and Glenn McGrath.         
	Zaheer said he is happy the way the youngsters of Indian cricket are shaping up.         
	Its wonderful to see Ishant Sharma, RP Singh and Munaf Patel grow as fast bowlers. We definitely have a very strong back-up of pacers in India. It is good to see people raising their hands, taking responsibility and performing.         
	Zaheer said he should count himself lucky for escaping getting spanked by Sachin Tendulkar and Sanath Jayasuriya as they all play for the same team.         
	I should thank my stars that I dont have to face them (Sachin and Jayasuriya). Both are legends and together they are a deadly combination. Our openers must be giving nightmares to a number of teams in the tournament, he said.

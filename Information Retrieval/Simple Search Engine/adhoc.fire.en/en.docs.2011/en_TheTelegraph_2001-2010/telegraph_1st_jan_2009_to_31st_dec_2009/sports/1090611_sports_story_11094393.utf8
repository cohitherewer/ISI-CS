                                                   Stand-in No.2 yet to be named
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nottingham: Till late on Wednesday, a full 24 hours after vice-captain Virender Sehwag was ruled out of the ongoing World T20, the national selectors hadnt named a stand-in No.2.         
	We havent discussed the issue as yet, one of the selectors told The Telegraph.         
	Yuvraj Singh is the logical choice.         
	Chief selector Krishnamachari Srikkanth, by the way, is in London. Colleague Raja Venkat will be joining him in a couple of days.         
	Meanwhile, West Indies captain Chris Gayle, who didnt play on Wednesday, is going to be available for Fridays Super Eight match against India.         
	Gayle had suffered a knee injury in the West Indies opener, against Australia

                                                   Franklin: I can add variety
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hamilton: James Franklin, who returns to the New Zealand squad for the Test series against India after being side-lined for nearly two years with a crippling knee-injury, feels that his inclusion in the team will lend some variation to the Black Caps bowling attack.                 
	The following are excerpts               
	What do you think you bring to the team?         
	Just a little bit of variation I can swing the ball and being a left-armer, itll be a different angle of attack for the batsmen to come up against.         
	On the Indian batting line-up         
	I didnt really watch a lot because Ive myself been playing a lot of cricket. But Ive kept tabs on scorecards. Its obvious that the top four or five have been very productive, but as Ive said, Test cricket is a different game and you have to begin afresh.         
	Have you bowled to Laxman or Dravid before?         
	Havent yet. I have not yet played against India. I am still to come up against the Indian batting line-up and I am looking forward to it.         
	On how to negotiate the Indian batsmen         
	Theres been not too much discussion on that. I played a game with (Dhawal) Kulkarni... There wasnt too much discussion on how to check them

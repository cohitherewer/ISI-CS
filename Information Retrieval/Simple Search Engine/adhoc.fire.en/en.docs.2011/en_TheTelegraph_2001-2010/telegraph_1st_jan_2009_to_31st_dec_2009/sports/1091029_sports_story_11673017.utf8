The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A special knock, says Dhoni
                                                   A special knock, says Dhoni
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nagpur: Mahendra Singh Dhoni said his match-winning 124 was special. At the media conference, Wednesdays Man of the Match praised the impressive start by the top-order that, according to him, had made his task easier.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	If he wanted to make a statement with his innings         
	Not really a statement. It was a good wicket to bat on. The way Gautam (Gambhir) was batting we knew singles would suffice initially We needed to keep the wickets in hand for the batting Powerplay. The foundation would help us get the momentum in the slog overs. Thats why we decided not to take any risks early on.         
	The way he bludgeoned the attack         
	That was later on in the innings. I had an excellent platform, we had a great start, the run-rate was already more than six, and the wicket was very good. We knew we only needed to stay cool         
	Batting up the order         
	I have said in the past that its difficult for me to bat up the order. With Sachin and Viru (Sehwag) opening and Gautam and Yuvraj coming in at No. 3 and No.4, respectively, the top four slots are fixed. The next slot is open and I always float myself there. With each player doing his job, its best not to tamper with the order.         
	Had he won the toss, hed have         
	We played three spinners, including two part timers. There was much dew last evening. I would have also fielded had I won the toss.         
	Ishant Sharmas bowling         
	It is a process and takes a bit of time. When you get hit you have the tendency to lose your rhythm. When you bowl well and get wickets your pace automatically goes up and you bowl in the right areas.         
	His knock         
	It is a special one considering it came against the worlds top team. But then each and every century and innings is also special         
	On getting hit on the helmet off the first ball         
	It went blank. Thats what happens when you get hit on the head. It was a good delivery. Its not like I was hit on the head for the first time. I am quite used to it. If you want to put together a package, youll get at least 15 shots of my getting hit on the head. Its not the best way to start the innings. But, as I said, we were always looking to capitalise on the platform.         
	On how his batting has changed over the years         
	You play by instinct but, at the same time, there is a cautious attempt to see what the demand actually is. If there is a youngster playing at No.4 and he tries to play a big shot and gets out, its okay, people say he will learn and improve. But when it comes to a senior who has played around a 100-odd internationals, if he succeeds he is a braveheart, if not, people rip him apart. At times thats at the back of your mind. Earlier, when you went for a big shot, you backed yourself and went for it. Its not the same as it was three or four years ago  less responsibility and more flair. But now I have more responsibility every time I turn up on the field. Some of the venues still expect me to hit those big sixes, so it is different, especially batting at 5, 6 or 7, usually you play according to the situation. A lot depends on the kind of pressure you are handling.         
	His dream of getting 30 centuries         
	Thirty ODI centuries is a dream. Ill be happy to get a few more.         
	Harbhajan Singhs bowling         
	Im happy with the way he bowled today. He did get hit for two bad overs in the Powerplay but his line and length was good and he was consistent.

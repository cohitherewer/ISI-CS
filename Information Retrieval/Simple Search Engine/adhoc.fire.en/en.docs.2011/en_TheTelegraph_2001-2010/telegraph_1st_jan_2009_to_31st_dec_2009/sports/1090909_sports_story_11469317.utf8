The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Flintoff ponders Dubai shift
                                                     Flintoff ponders Dubai shift
            Nick Hoult            Andrew Flintoff                           
	Andrew Flintoff is due in Dubai this week, primarily to undergo extensive treatment on his right knee but also with a view to moving possibly permanently to the Gulf state.         
	The move by Flintoff and his family will increase the likelihood that he will become crickets first T20 hired hand if he manages to recover from a double multi-fracture operation performed at the end of the Ashes series.         
	This newspaper understands Flintoff will live in Dubai until the new year. He will step up his rehabilitation as well explore the possibility of joining a string of sports stars, mainly golfers, who have made the region a permanent base.         
	Its always easier doing rehabilitation in warm weather and thats the main reason why weve decided to go to Dubai, said Flintoff.         
	The tax perks of living permanently in the United Arab Emirates will appeal to Flintoff, whose annual earnings were recently estimated at nearly 2.5 million, making him the highest paid cricketer outside India.         
	He owes that financial power mainly to his contract with the Chennai Super Kings and moving closer geographically to India will allow him to have greater contact with his IPL team. It remains unclear whether they will have any say in his recovery plan but the costs of his medical treatment, which will include David Roberts, the Lancashire physio, travelling regularly to Dubai to oversee his fitness regime, will be covered by the England and Wales Cricket Board.         
	Flintoff, 31, has been guaranteed that will be the case even if he does not receive a central contract when his deal expires at the end of the month. Andrew Chandler, Flintoffs agent, held talks with Hugh Morris, the managing director of England cricket, last week.         
	Flintoff would be the first England cricketer to have retired from Test cricket and yet continue receiving a central contract and it is more likely that he will be awarded a deal for one-day cricket alone, subject to fitness.         
	Flintoff is still aiming to be fit in time for Englands tour to Bangladesh in February when the team are likely to play three one-day games and a T20 match.         
	But whether Flintoff will reach a stage where he is capable of playing 50-over cricket remains unclear and his recuperation period in Dubai will be crucial to his long-term prognosis.         
	If he is restricted to T20 cricket only then a move to Dubai would make financial sense. Next years revamped T20 Cup is likely to be played in June, meaning Flintoff would be able to continue playing for Lancashire without breaking tax rules which stipulate he must not spend more than 90 days in the United Kingdom.         
	Flintoff has a year remaining on his contract with Lancashire and their chief executive, Jim Cumbes, admitted last week that the club were seeking talks with Flintoff.         
	He has explored the possibility of moving to Dubai in the past to establish a cricket academy in the region. He has also used a winter break before as part of rehabilitation from a major surgery. In 2007 he spent several months in Florida while recovering from ankle surgery.

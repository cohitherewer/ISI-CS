The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brett Lee takes five
                                                   Brett Lee takes five
                      
	Worcester: The case for Brett Lees inclusion in the team for the Ashes opener at Cardiff was made stronger by the pacers maiden five-wicket haul in an English first-class game that came in a stunning spell of reverse-swing against the England Lions.         
	With the other quicks producing dry spells it fell to Lee to dleiver and deliver he did in a nine-over effort either side of tea to hold the opponents to 302 for six.         
	At the start of the day Lee, who is returning from ankle surgery, was fighting for his place and with England dismissing Warwickshire for 102 in their practice game at Edgbaston, Australia needed a spark and he provided it to finish with five for 53 from 20 overs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brendon expected to quit, but not now
                                                     Brendon expected to quit, but not now
    - SRK hasnt spoken to the New Zealander on captaincy           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Brendon McCullum                                 
	Calcutta: Its unlikely that Brendon McCullum will make any further comment on the Kolkata Knight Riders captaincy, while IPL 2009 is in progress, but its expected that hell eventually keep his word and walk away from the top job.         
	Brendon is an honourable person and once he has said that hell leave the captaincy if the team doesnt make the semi-finals, then nobody should disbelieve him... In any case, Brendon had 2010 in mind, not quitting while this edition was on, a key member of the Knights team management told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking from Johannesburg on the morning after it was confirmed that the Knights wouldnt get beyond the league stage, the gentleman added: To be honest, the issue just hasnt come up for discussion... Moreover, given the state were in, a change at the top wont do wonders in the three matches that remain. Perhaps, weve been done in by a spell of black magic...         
	McCullum, it may be recalled, had talked of stepping aside after losing to the Mumbai Indians for the first time in IPL 2009, in Port Elizabeth. That was some weeks ago, when the Knights could still have turned things around.         
	Alas, the wait for one spark of brilliance or a stunning match-winning effort continues...         
	Significantly, principal owner Shah Rukh Khan, who endorsed John Buchanans move to elevate McCullum (and humiliate Sourav Ganguly), hasnt had a one-on-one with the New Zealander on the captaincy issue.         
	McCullum is the Black Caps vice-captain and its to be seen whether his handling of the Knights impacts on his getting to lead New Zealand at some point in the future.         
	His CV, however, has definitely lost some of its sheen.         
	Shah Rukh hasnt spoken exclusively to Brendon... His last message to the team was that the players should, at least, enjoy their cricket now that the next stage is beyond us... I doubt if Shah Rukh will discuss anything major while were still in South Africa, the same key management member pointed out.         
	The gentleman confirmed that the team didnt have an official vice-captain, though Brad Hodge has been projected as one.         
	Well, so much for a franchise whose head of cricket operations, Buchanan, made such a song and dance of having as many as five captains/leaders in the squad!         
	Many, in fact, are wondering why Hodge (rated so highly by Buchanan) isnt in Australias T20 line-up. After all, if somebody is high on class, then he should first be playing for his country.         
	Hodges last appearance for Australia, in any form, was 12 months ago. That too in a stand-in capacity.         
	Meanwhile, Wednesday was a day off for the Knights. The McCullums will train on Thursday, in the lead-up to Saturdays match against the Deccan Chargers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karim takes loss in stride
                                                   Karim takes loss in stride
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: It turned out to be quite a disastrous Sunday for Mohun Bagan and their coach Karim Bencharifa because not only were they comprehensively beaten by East Bengal, but they would also miss the services of key-man Bhaichung Bhutia, due to a double booking, in the crucial match against Churchill Brothers.         
	But just as East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick refused to count Sundays victory as the best of his career, his counterpart, Bencharifa said that the loss certainly wasnt the biggest upset of his. He, in fact, explained that he was a professional coach and so viewed things in a different light. The loss against East Bengal is similar to our other losses in the I-League. For us its just another game. It was all a matter of three points and unfortunately we couldnt clinch those points. I am here to win titles. He went on to add: The margin really doesnt matter. Its all the same.         
	Refusing suggestion that the loss has dented Bagans chances of claiming the I-League title, he said: Fact is, in spite of this loss, we are very much up there on the points tally. Our target is certainly not to win a specific match, we are targeting the title.         
	Bencharifa had encouraging words for his wards, as he said: Regrouping will be the main agenda for us from hereon. The loss doesnt mean the end of the world.

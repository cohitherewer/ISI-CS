                                                   Teams to have an appeal less
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) reduced the number of unsuccessful appeals to two from three in the umpire decision review system for the upcoming four-Test series between England and the West Indies.         
	The governing body of world cricket said the decision was taken in a bid to prevent frivolous challenges by players, the ICC said in a statement.         
	Both England and the West Indies have approved the change and if it proves to be a successful modification in the first two Tests of the series, it will be tried one last time in Australias tour of South Africa.         
	A full appraisal of the trial will be undertaken thereafter and the issue whether to continue with the review system or discard it will be debated at the ICC cricket committee in May.         
	The umpire decision review system trial has so far received mostly positive feedback from players and officials but we want to get it right before we consider applying it to international cricket on a permanent basis, ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said in a statement.         
	That is why we have made this refinement to it. It has become clear during the trial so far that three unsuccessful reviews per innings is too many as there is potential there for frivolous or unnecessary reviews to be made by one side or the other, Lorgat said.         
	With this change, the fielding and batting sides now can make two unsuccessful appeals to the umpire per innings to change a decision.

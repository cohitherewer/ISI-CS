                                                   Fisichella: Wet tyres did us in 
                      
	New Delhi: Force Indias Italian driver Giancarlo Fisichella reckons different strategies for his and teammate Adrian Sutils cars would have suited the Formula One outfit gunning for its maiden F1 points.         
	Fisichella is unhappy with his lowly 18th place finish in Malaysian Grand Prix. In the rain-ruined race at Sepang, Force Indias gamble with extreme wet tyres boomeranged as the rain didnt come fast enough.         
	I think the main problem was the wrong call to change tyres. We changed tyres too early, at least three or four laps early. I was running with extreme wet tyres, it was dry so we destroyed them, he rued.

	Kingston: There could be few complaints about their batting in the opening Test, but West Indies have decided to strengthen their batting reserves for the second Test against England, starting Friday in Antigua.         
	West Indies won the opening Test at Sabina Park by an innings and 23 runs inside four days to take a 1-0 lead in the four-Test series, but they are not taking any chances with their batting and have brought Lendl Simmons and Ryan Hinds into their 14-member squad.         
	Making way are out-of-form batsman Xavier Marshall and off-spin bowler Amit Jaggernauth in the squad which was chosen for the first Test. An injury to uncapped opener Dale Richards has kept him out of consideration for selection.         
	Simmons is the nephew of the former West Indies allrounder and Zimbabwe coach Phil Simmons, and is no stranger to the English visitors. They will remember him for a long time following his first-class career-best 282 in their second tour match in St Kitts just prior to the opening Test.

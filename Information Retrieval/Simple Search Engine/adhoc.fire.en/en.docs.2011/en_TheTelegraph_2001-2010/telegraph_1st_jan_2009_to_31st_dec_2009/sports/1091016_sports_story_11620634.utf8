The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | T amp;T bite versus NSWs might
                                                   T amp;T bite versus NSWs might
                      
	Hyderabad: It will be a battle of nerves when Trinidad amp; Tobago (T amp;T) and the New South Wales (NSW) Blues  so far, the two unbeaten sides in the event  clash in a League A match of the Champions League T20 Friday.         
	The team from the Caribbean has everyone surprised with their showing in the group stage where, Wednesday, they ousted IPL II champions Deccan Chargers.         
	Even though T amp;T came into the tournament as the underdogs they showed that they can spring a surprise or two, when, riding on strong all-round performances, the Dwayne Bravo-led side humbled Somerset in their opening group encounter.         
	Bravo, who, thus far, has been more successful with the ball with seven wickets from two matches, is due for the runs and would be waiting to explode with the bat.         
	However, somebody or the other, either from the top or lower down the order has chipped in with useful contribution in times of crisis.         
	William Perkins has got good starts at the top but he would be looking to capitalise on them to get big totals given that the competition gets tougher and stiffer from here on.         
	On the other hand, NSW captain Simon Katich would be relying on his sides experience.         
	NSWs road to the Super Eight has been paved with victories over South Africas Diamond Eagles and English county side Sussex Sharks in the group outings.         
	With a batting order boasting of Katich himself, Phillip Hughes, David Warner and Moises Henriques, the Australian side would be hoping to slaughter the less experienced T amp;T bowling.         
	When it comes to their own bowling, Brett Lee has been in great form and would definitely act as a thorn in the side for the T amp;T batsmen.         
	NSWs bowling can be termed the tournaments best with the likes of Doug Bollinger, Stuart Clark, Nathan Hauritz filling a formidable armoury.                 (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chirag rise to the top
                                                                                                                                     Chirag rise to the top
            A STAFF REPORTER            Joshimar (centre) celebrates one of his goals with teammates at the Barasat Stadium on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Its a sort of silent revolution that has been going on in this seasons I-League. Chirag United, a team put together mostly with the big clubs discards and without the brouhaha usually associated with the so-called more fancied names, are currently leading the standings, thanks to their 2-0 victory over Salgaocar SC at the Barasat Stadium Friday. Joshimar struck both the goals.         
	Chirag now have 15 points from seven outings, three more than Dempo SC who have played a match less.         
	A disciplined approach, decent fitness and impeccable calculations  on the part of coach Subrata Bhattacharya  have seen the team in purple soar to heights that they can be proud of.         
	Still unbeaten in the league, Chirag, actually, didnt have a composed start Friday as they looked a little rusty and out of sorts. Salgaocar seized the opportunity moving into the rival box quite often. Chirag goalkeeper Somnath Khara put up quite a few good saves as the likes of Beevan DMello and Luciano Sabrosa took attempts at the rival goal. But lack of finishing undid all of their efforts. All through the first half, the Chirag midfield failed to play as a cohesive unit and, as a result, Edmilson and Joshimar faced a drought of good passes.         
	However, the breather worked wonders for Subratas boys as Jayanta Sen and Denson Devadas, at the heart of the field, woke up from their slumber. One such enterprising effort in the 52nd minute released Edmilson through the left. The Brazilian was quick to lay it off for countrymate Joshimar who tapped it in to give the hosts the lead.         
	As the visitors gradually faded away from the contest, Chirag shone brighter and, in the 68th minute, Joshimar was once again on target. Gaining possession from a defensive lapse, the tall striker shielded off three rival defenders before putting it past an advancing Kalyan Chowbey.         
	Edmilson, though, was guilty of being booked, his second in a row, for time-wasting and this might cost Chirag dear as they take on the power of defending champions Churchill Brothers in the next match.         
	Well, Chirag certainly dont have the might off the field to fill in the stands with thousands of supporters; but on it, they possess the courage and determination to fight. City giants Mohun Bagan and East Bengal have already bitten the dust at their hands and one just hope its just the beginning. As they say, revolutions never go backwards!

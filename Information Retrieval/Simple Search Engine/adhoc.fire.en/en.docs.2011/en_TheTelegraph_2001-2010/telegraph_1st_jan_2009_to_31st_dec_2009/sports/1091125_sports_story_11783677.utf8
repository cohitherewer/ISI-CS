The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Setback for Sasikiran, Sandipan
                                                                                                                       7                                      Setback for Sasikiran, Sandipan
                      
	Khanty Mansiysk: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran and Sandipan Chanda are staring at an early exit from the World Cup after suffering defeats in their respective first games of the second round here Tuesday.         
	Sasikiran lost to Etienne Bacrot of France while Chanda went down against Dmitry Jakovenko of Russia. It was a tough day for the Indians as both did not get desirable positions and were outwitted despite playing with white pieces.         
	The third Indian left in the fray, Surya Shekhar Ganguly, tried hard to wriggle out of a worse endgame against Chinese Wang Hao but his chances of surviving the game remained bleak once he was down a pawn.         
	In the end Hoa converted his extra material in to a full point with immaculate technique. Though it is a two-games match to start with under standard time control, both Sasi and Chanda are going to find the going trough as they play with the slightly unfavourable colour  black  in the return game.         
	They will have to go all out for a win against players higher rated than them and it is never an easy task.         
	Sasikiran got a semblance of an advantage with his white pieces against Bacrot but could not continue the momentum out of a Hedgehog structure.         
	Chanda was outdone in a NImzo Indian defence game against Jakovenko who was saddled with a bit passive position in the opening.         
	Topping in the charts was Toni Nyback of Finland who defeated Russian Peter Svidler. Also ending on the losing side were Grandmaster of repute  Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine, Alexander Morozevich of Russia and Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand hits form finally
                                                   Anand hits form finally
                      
	Nice: Viswanathan Anand returned to form in the rapid game to beat Ukrainian Vassily Ivanchuk by 1.5-0.5 margin in the fifth round of the Amber blindfold and rapid chess tournament here.         
	Anand slipped a bit in the blindfold game after getting a few chances but came back strongly to stir tactical complications in the return game to post his victory.         
	Levon Aronian of Armenia joined Russian Vladimir Kramnik in the lead in the combined standings with 6.5 points, half a point ahead of Russian Alexander Morozevich, who now stands sole third. Anand moved up to joint fourth spot after beating Ivanchuk and the Indian ace now shares this spot along with Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria.

	Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Sunday announced a cash reward of Rs 25 lakh each for Team India members after they reached the No.1 spot in Test rankings.         
	The Board also announced Rs 10 lakh for the support staff and a similar reward for the national selectors at its annual awards function Sunday.         
	Gautam Gambhir received the Polly Umrigar Award for the Best Cricketer 2008-09 while World Cup winner Mohinder Amarnath received the Col CK Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award.         
	Viru (Virender Sehwag) said last year that he was happy to get the award given to his idol (Sachin Tendulkar). Similarly, I am also happy to get the award given to my favourite cricketer, Gambhir said while accepting the award which carried a cash prize of Rs 5 lakh.         
	Gambhir scored 1,269 runs from eight Tests at 84.60, including five hundreds, in the period under consideration.         
	Amarnath emulated his father, the late Lala Amarnath, who was the first recipient of the award in 1994. His award carried a cash prize of Rs 15 lakh.         
	Amarnath, who is known for his comebacks on the field and constant battle with BCCI mandarins off it, recalled his fathers advice.         
	He told me, son, the name is Amarnath. It has both advantages and disadvantages. You should not lose heart whether you get a place or not, you have to keep trying, he said.

                                                   Glamorise sport, says Pankaj
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: World billiards and snooker champion Pankaj Advani Monday said there was an urgent need to glamorise billiards and snooker to make the games more enjoyable for the spectators.         
	A day after winning the national snooker title in Agra, the 25-year-old world champion said he was looking forward to taking part in next months ONGC World Snooker Championships in Hyderabad.         
	It will be a unique show, said Advani. I believe the organisers have decided to introduce various entertaining events like fashion shows as part of the world championships.         
	I have no doubt they are working in the right direction. There is an urgent need to glamorise the sport, Advani added.         
	The president of the Billiards and Snooker Federation of India, Captain P.V.K. Mohan said for the first time eight women referees will be doing duty during the world meet that runs from November 14 to 29. It will definitely add colour, he quipped.         
	Advani, who defeated Geet Sethi in the national final in Agra on Sunday, said his rivalry with Sethi is like the one between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal in tennis.         
	Geet is a great player and certainly the most difficult one to play. I thoroughly enjoy competing against him, commented Advani.         
	I would go all out to win the world championship in Hyderabad. That is my favourite venue and I should be able to win the title, Advani said.         
	Sethi, on the other hand, heaped praises on Advani. This boy (Advani) is not yet 25 and is already setting new benchmarks in the game.         
	He has already won seven world titles, something no other Indian has ever done in any sport, Sethi pointed out.         
	Sethi said Advani was full of authority and grace. He has tremendous mental strength and is edging me out these days.

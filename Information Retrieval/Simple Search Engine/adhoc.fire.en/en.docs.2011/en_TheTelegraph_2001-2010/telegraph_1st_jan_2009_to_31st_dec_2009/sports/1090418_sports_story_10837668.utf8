                                                   Consolation victory for Aussie colts
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Australias under-19 team registered a consolation win over India in the third and final one-dayer between the two sides in Perth.         
	India under-19 had already won the series by winning the first two games. The hosts batted first at the WACA, and scored 276 for seven from their allotted 50 overs. The highlight of their innings was the sixth-wicket stand between Jason Floros (70) and Joel Garrett (52).         
	Opener Mayank Agarwal, Indias most consistent batsman on the tour, continued his splendid run with a knock of 60. There were 15 deliveries left when the 10th wicket fell at 261. Indias final match of the tour will be a three-dayer at the WACA, from April 19-21.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhupathi moves up, Sania out of doubles

	Indian Wells: It was a mixed day for the Indians at the BNP Paribas Open, here on Friday. While Mahesh Bhupathi advanced to the doubles second round, Sania Mirza crashed out of the womens doubles.         
	Sania and her partner Chia-Jung Chuang of Taipei went down 1-6, 4-6 to the Argentine-Israeli team of Gisela Dulko and Shahar Peer in the opening round. However, Sania is still in contention in the singles event and the Indian ace takes on 12th seed Italian Flavia Panetta.         
	In mens doubles, the third-seeded pair of Bhupathi and Bahamas Mark Knowles edged past Russians Dmitry Tursunov and Igor Kunitsyn 7-5, 6-3 in the opening round.         
	In a contest that lasted over an hour, Bhupathi and Knowles had to toil in the opening set but they ultimately prevailed over their error-prone unseeded rivals.         
	In contrast, the second set was dominated by the Indo-Bahamian pair who broke Tursunov and Kunitsyn thrice before wrapping up the proceedings in their favour.         
	Meanwhile, in a first-round match of the womens singles, Amelie Mauresmo rallied from 1-3 down in the deciding set to beat Anna-Lena Groenefeld 5-7, 6-3, 6-4.         
	Mauresmo won four straight games to move ahead 5-3 against the German, then missed three match points in the next game before serving out the nearly three-hour match. It was her first in a month since she won her 25th career title at the Paris Indoors.         
	It was not a great level of play, but the main thing was to win and to go through this first match, which wasnt so easy, Mauresmo said. Its my first match after almost four weeks now, so you always want to try to get into it and get into a rhythm, which was not so great today. But a good fight, and just happy to go through.         
	Top seed Dinara Safina survived a tough test of her title credentials before beating Tsvetana Pironkova of Bulgaria 7-6 (10-8), 6-2 in the second round of the WTA event on Friday.         
	The Russian saved four set points in the first-set tiebreak against a determined Pironkova before easing through the second set. World No. 50 Pironkova served for the first set at 5-4 but Safina broke straight back and then held her nerve in the tiebreak to win it 10-8.         
	The second set was much more straightforward and Safina clinched victory to set up a third-round meeting with 28th seed Shahar Peer of Israel.         
	Fourth seed Vera Zvonareva, number eight Victoria Azarenka of Belarus and Danish ninth seed Caroline Wozniacki also advanced. But there was a shock defeat for sixth seed Sevtlana Kuznetsova as she was beaten 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 by Urszula Radwanska of Poland in round two.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pak to play Australia in England
                                                   CRICKET BRIEFS 
                      
	Pak to play Australia in England   
	Calcutta: The English and Wales Cricket Board announced on Friday that it had reached an agreement with the Pakistan Cricket Board to stage two Tests and two T20 Internationals between Pakistan and Australia in England July 2010. The ECB also confirmed that England will host Pakistan for four Tests, five one-day Internationals and two T20 matches in August and September 2010.  
	England lose         
	London: England women suffered a 34-run loss to Australia in a Twenty20 match in Derby. England had defeated their archrivals in a dramatic World Twenty20 semi-final, but it was a different story Thursday. England made 117 for six in reply to Australias 151 for three.         
	Kevin claim         
	London: Kevin Pietersen did his best to allay concerns over his troublesome Achilles injury ahead of the Ashes by declaring himself practically 100 per cent fit. I am nursing my injury at the moment, getting myself right. Im practically 100 per cent fit. Its real good news. Ive done quite a lot of work so in the last couple of weeks So, fingers crossed, I am going to be pretty good for the whole summer, he said.         
	VVS shines         
	Derby: VVS Laxman played second fiddle to Andrew Flintoff as Lancashire thumped Derbyshire by 56 runs in the Twenty20 Cup here. Flintoff hammered 93 from 41 balls to hog the limelight but Laxmans 45-ball 63 was no less significant as the duo shared a fourth-wicket stand of 99 to help Lancashire pile up 220 for five, their best ever Twenty20 score. In reply, Derbyshire could manage 164 for seven in their allotted 20 overs.         
	Mitchell tale         
	Melbourne: Had legendary fast bowler Dennis Lillie not spotted him years ago at a cricket clinic in Queensland, Australian Mitchell Johnson said that he would have ended up joining the army. If I hadnt gone to that camp, I probably would have been in the army. Ive had friends that have gone over to Iraq and all that, have been shot at, a friend whos a tank driver So theyve been in the action. Its pretty scary, said Johnson.         
	Fixtures         
	Mumbai: The domestic and international schedule at home for the coming season will be finalised by the BCCI when its Tours Programmes and Fixtures Committee meets here on July 1. This is the first meeting of the committee since it was formed, said one of the members of the panel headed by BCCI vice president and Indian Premier League chairman Lalit Modi.         
	Bond contract         
	Wellington: Fast bowler Shane Bond moved closer to a Test return on Friday when he was included among 20 players awarded contracts by New Zealand Cricket.           AGENCIES

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Asif is likely to get first game
                                                   Asif is likely to get first game
                      
	Centurion: Imran Nazir is unlikely to be available for Wednesdays match against Australia. The opener had injured his hand while fielding against India.         
	Shoaib Malik in all probability will open the innings with Kamran Akmal in such a scenario. Fawad Alam will take Nazirs place and will bat in the middle-order.         
	Mohammed Asif is also likely to play his first international match in 16 months since being suspended for doping and disciplinary offences last year. Indications are that Umar Gul would be rested if Asif makes the XI.         
	Centurion has been considered the more spin-friendly of the Champions Trophy surfaces thus far, although it remains to be seen whether those characteristics will remain after Mondays deluge that led to the cancellation of the India-Australia match.         
	The biggest concern for the Aussies Wednesday would be all-rounder Shane Watson. Pushed to the opening slot some time ago, the big-hitting right-hander has come a cropper in the tournament so far, managing two ducks.         
	He has looked uncomfortable facing the new ball, and it remains to be seen if he would be persisted with as the opener.         
	The other opener, Tim Paine, has adjusted well. He batted through a testing period in the match against India to make a half-century and stabilise the Australian innings. Mike Hussey also seemed to have rediscovered some of his lost form, against India, by scoring a morale boosting half-century.

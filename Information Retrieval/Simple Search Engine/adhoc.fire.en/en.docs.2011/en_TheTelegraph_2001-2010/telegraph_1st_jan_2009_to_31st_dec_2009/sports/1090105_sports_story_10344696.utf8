                                                   Chennai Open Players to watch out for
                              
	Nikolay Davydenko           Seeded: 1  Country: Russia  Born: June 2, 1981  Playing style: Right-handed  ATP Ranking: 5 (singles)  Singles titles: 14  Doubles title: 1  Prize Money: $9.6m                  
	It will be the Russians second visit to Chennai who bowed out in the first round in 2001. Known as the Iron Man on the circuit for his tough scheduling  he plays 30 weeks in a season which is unusual for a top-10 player  Davydenko celebrated his being cleared of any wrongdoing by the ATP after its inquiry into match-fixing with a fourth consecutive top-five finish in 2008. The highpoint of the season was the Miami Masters title en route to which he had back-to-back wins over Andy Roddick and Rafael Nadal. He was born in Ukraine and grew up in Germany till the age of 18 when he moved back to Russia. Ivan Lendl and Yannick Noah were his childhood heroes. He was coached by elder brother Eduard.                           
	Stanislas Wawrinka     Seeded: 2  Country: Switzerland  Born: March 28, 1985  Playing style: Right-handed  ATP Ranking: 13 (singles)  Singles titles: 1  Doubles title:1  Prize Money: $2.4 m    
	Clearly the player to watch out for after breaking into the top-10 (was ranked career high at No.9 in June) and winning the doubles gold with Roger Federer at the Olympics. A French Open junior champion, Wawrinka reached his maiden Masters final in Rome where he beat Andy Murray and James Blake before losing to Novak Djokovic. Has remained in the top-10 for 22 weeks since May. Besides, has been Switzerlands Davis Cup spearhead for a while now and this year won all his four singles matches to send the team back into the World Group. A player of Polish decent, Wawrinka is anything but a Pole. His father Wolfram is a German and mother Isabelle a Swiss while grandparents are Czech. He quit school at the age of 15 to focus on tennis and three years later won the boys singles title at Roland Garros in 2003.                   
	Marin Cilic           Seeded: 3  Country: Croatia  Born: September 28, 1988  Playing style: Right-handed  ATP Ranking: 23 (singles)  lSingles titles: 1  Career Prize Money: $990,972    
	Another junior champion at Roland Garros (2005), Mrnja is a future star in the making. The 6 ft 6 inches player comes into the tournament after a breakthrough year on the mens circuit, which incidentally began in Chennai with a semi-final appearance in doubles with Aisam Qureshi. Cilic became the top Croatian player after jumping nearly 50 places to finish the year at No. 22. He won his first ATP title in New Haven and made it to the fourth round at Wimbledon and the third at US Open, and is ranked No.6 in aces with 558 to his credit. Soccer is his hobby and follows AC Milan and the Croatian national team. He admires Goran Ivanisevic and Ivan Ljubicic in tennis and is coached by Bob Brett, the Australian who has helped some of the top-notch players in the past.                   
	Ivo Karlovic           Seeded: 4  Country: Croatia  Born: February 28, 1979  Playing style: Right-handed  ATP Ranking: 26 (singles)  Singles titles: 4  Doubles title: 1  Prize Money: $2.7m    
	On his third visit to Chennai, Karlovic at 6 ft 10 inches is the tallest player on the ATP Tour and to have been in the top-100 since rankings were introduced in 1973. But the Croatian, who hit the headlines in 2003 when he dumped defending champion Lleyton Hewitt in the first round at Wimbledon, has come a long way from being a one-dimension player. Through sheer hard work, the Giant from Salata has grown from being just a big server to be ranked 26 in the world. Defending his title at Nottingham and having reached the quarter finals in four other tournaments, he had the most aces for 2008 at 961 and first serve percentage at 81. Father Vlado is a meteorologist and mother Gordana works in agriculture.

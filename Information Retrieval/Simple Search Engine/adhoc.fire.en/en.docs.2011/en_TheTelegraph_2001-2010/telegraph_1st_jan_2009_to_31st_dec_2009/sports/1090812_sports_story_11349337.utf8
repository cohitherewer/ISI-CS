            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former Australian batsman Matthew Hayden is set to start a new career as an administrator with the Cricket Australia (CA). Hayden will join the 14-member CA board as a players representative, replacing former captain Allan Border, who is stepping down after seven years of association with the board.         
	The CA chairman Jack Clarke welcomed Hayden to the Board while also praising Border for volunteering his time to serve Australian cricket at a national level for an extended time.         
	I think it is fantastic that someone of his (Borders) stature and workload was willing to give seven years of his time in unpaid service to the game at a national level, Clarke said.         
	I am also delighted to welcome Matt Hayden on board  he brings a combination of contemporary, elite playing experience in all major cricketing nations; additional understanding of player issues through his work on the board of the Australian Cricketers Association (ACA), experience in the new Twenty20 phenomena as an IPL player, an d a passion for development of indigenous cricket.         
	Clarke went on to congratulate Queensland Cricket for taking the initiative of appointing Hayden. I congratulate Queensland Cricket on having the foresight and vision to appoint Matthew Hayden to the Cricket Australia Board so soon after his retirement from wearing the Baggy Green.         
	Speaking from the UK, Hayden said he had stood down from the board of the ACA to join the CA. I have enjoyed working for players in my work with the ACA board, sincerely thank my fellow directors, the management and staff there for their support, he said.         
	But I have accepted this new challenge because I am passionate about Australian cricket in its totality, including the kids in the cities and in the remote areas who want to play the game but might not have the access and opportunities, he said.

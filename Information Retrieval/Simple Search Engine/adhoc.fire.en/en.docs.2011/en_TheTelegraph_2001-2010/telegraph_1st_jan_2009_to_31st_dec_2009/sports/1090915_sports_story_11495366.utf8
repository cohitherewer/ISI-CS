The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arch rivals keep spot open for Bhaichung
                                                   Arch rivals keep spot open for Bhaichung
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Both Mohun Bagan and East Bengal want Bhaichung Bhutia. The Calcutta majors, who Monday arrived in the capital for the Durand Cup, with their campaigns beginning Wednesday, are both desperate for the services of Bhaichung for the tournament.         
	So much so that neither of the two clubs have submitted the full list of 20 players to the tournament committee. While Bagan have registered 18 players, East Bengal have a slot open for the India captain.         
	The hopes of the two are pinned on the All India Football Federation (AIFF)-appointed arbitrator, Amarendra Sharan, who may pronounce his verdict in the Bhaichung-Bagan impasse on Wednesday. While East Bengal officials feel the ace striker would be released to play for the team of his choice, Bagan are confident the ruling would be in their favour.         
	Meanwhile, Dempo Sports Club blanked Air India 4-1 in a Group III quarter final league match at the Ambedkar Stadium Monday. The Goans took the lead, through Peter Carvalho, in the 29th minute and struck three more in the second session.         
	Nigerian striker Ranty Martins increased the lead in the 60th minute. Two more goals followed, through Sunil Chetri (penalty) and the Brazilian Beto (free kick), before N.D. Opara pulled one back for Air India.         
	In another match, Mahindra United played out a goalless draw against Lajong FC, Shillong.

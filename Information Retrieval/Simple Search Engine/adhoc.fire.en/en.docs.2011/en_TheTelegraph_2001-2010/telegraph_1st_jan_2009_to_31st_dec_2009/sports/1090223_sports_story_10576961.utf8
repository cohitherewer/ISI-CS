    - East bengals desire to win made the difference, says coach             A STAFF REPORTER            East Bengal players (from left) Mehrajuddin Wadoo, M. Suresh and Rahim Nabi celebrate at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Coach Subhas Bhowmicks association with East Bengal has a sweet and sour history. Sunday would certainly be one of his sweetest memories as the red and gold brigade thrashed Mohun Bagan 3-0 at the Salt Lake Stadium to end their nine match winless streak against the city rivals.         
	But Bhowmick refused to term this victory one of the best of his career. Im not looking at this as a comeback. In football, sometimes you get success, sometimes you dont. Everything fell into place in this match because the boys played well, said the coach. He went on to add: I really had nothing to prove to anybody. Rather, its the boys who proved themselves.         
	Responding to the question whether he had expected that his team would thrash Bagan by three goals the coach said: I had spoken about four goals. You can ask my players.         
	Bhowmick, known for his in-the-face answers, explained that the teams burning desire to win made all the difference in this game. He was also all praises for Syed Rahim Nabi, who scored a brace, saying: Nabi is one of the best utility players in Indian football and will always be. I hope that he will continue to do that job for the next seven or eight years.         
	Terming the victory purely tactical, Bhowmick said: The onus was always on Mohun Bagan. After we got the first goal, it was obvious that they would go all out and leave us enough space in the middle. I left them a free passage down the middle and invited them to come into attack. Plugging their movement down the flanks was also an effective move.         
	He also showered praise on Yusif Yakubu and Ismael Addo saying both had been brilliant in the match. I wish I had worked with Yakubu a few years earlier. And Addo was excellent in spite of playing with pain, said the coach.         
	Bhowmick agreed that East Bengal were going through a difficult phase but reminded, the players got back their confidence after the match against Vasco, which we won 4-1.         
	He was also of the opinion that the chance factor played a vital role in the game.         
	 Whenever I have spoken about the luck factor, people have made fun of me. But I believe in God and that has helped me win this match, he said.

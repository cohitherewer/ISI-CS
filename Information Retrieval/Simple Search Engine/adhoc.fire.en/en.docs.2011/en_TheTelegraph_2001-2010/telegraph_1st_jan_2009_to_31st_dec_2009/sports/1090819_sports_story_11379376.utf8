The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bolt on course in 200m
                                                   Bolt on course in 200m
                      
	Berlin: Looking for his second gold medal of the world championships, Usain Bolt jogged across the line Tuesday to advance to the semi-finals of the 200 metres.         
	Two days after setting a world record of 9.58 seconds to win the 100, the Olympic 200 champion ran a good curve and coasted through the final straight to finish in 20.41 seconds, a full 1.11 seconds behind his world record.         
	In the absence of injured defending champion Tyson Gay, Bolt is the overwhelming favourite for gold, and he said he would try to get a second world record at the championships. Ill be running hard, Bolt said.         
	The Jamaican set a record of 19.30s at the Beijing Olympics, widely considered one of the toughest to beat in the sport.         
	Im just trying to get through the rounds. Thats my aim, Bolt said. Im trying to do it round by round like last year. Then Ill go to the finals and just execute.         
	After his wild celebrations and showboating after winning the 100m on Sunday, he was short on antics this time.         
	Jamaican teammate Steve Mullings had the best qualifying time, winning his heat in 20.23. Shawn Crawford was third in 20.37, with American teammate Wallace Spearmon also easily advancing.         
	The final for the 200 is set for Thursday. Bolt is also favoured to lead Jamaica to a sprint relay gold on Saturday to equal his feat of three gold at the Olympics.         
	While Bolt has lived up to his top billing Olympic pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva failed to live up to her own. Polands Anna Rogowska claimed a huge upset victory Monday when she took the gold medal and left Russias world record holder in tears after three failures.         
	Rogowska claimed the title with a clearance of 4.75 metres. Fellow Pole Monika Pyrek shared silver with American Chelsea Johnson after both cleared 4.65.         
	She lost to Rogowska at the London Grand Prix last month though and looked sluggish in all three attempts on Monday.         
	Isinbayeva was in tears and said: I prepared well but I dont have an explanation, though an injury on my jumping leg did effect my build up. This defeat will motivate me to be more concentrated. I think it will be useful for me.         
	Also Monday, Ethiopian Kenenisa Bekele joined compatriot Haile Gebrselassie as a four-time 10,000 metres world champion as he surged to victory with a trademark last-lap burst.         
	Bekele clocked 26:46.31, a championship best but well off his world record mark, to claim his sixth consecutive 10,000 metres global title.         
	Monday also saw the Jamaicans making their domination in the 100m complete when Olympic champion Shelly-Ann Fraser exploded from the blocks and held on to win gold with the seasons best time of 10.73 seconds. Compatriot Kerron Stewart took silver with American Carmelita Jeter snatching bronze.         
	Meanwhile, Indias dismal show continued with long distance runner Surendra Kumar Singh clocking 28:35.51s to finish 19th in the mens 10,000m final.           (AGENCIES)

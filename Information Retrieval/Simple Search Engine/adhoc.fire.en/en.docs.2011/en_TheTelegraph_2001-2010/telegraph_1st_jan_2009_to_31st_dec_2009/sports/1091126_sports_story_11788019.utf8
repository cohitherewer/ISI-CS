The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arnold: Spare a thought for Murali
                                                                                                                       7                                      Arnold: Spare a thought for Murali
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Kanpur: Former Sri Lanka player Russel Arnold feels that one should spare a thought for spin wizard Muthiah Muralidharan before criticising him for his below-par performance in the ongoing Test series between India and Sri Lanka.         
	I agree that Murali is past his prime but look at the kind of tracks he has been bowling on for the last decade. More often than not he hasnt got any help from the wicket, so spare a thought for him, said Arnold, who has started a new innings as a commentator.         
	Arnold who played 180 ODIs for Sri Lanka feels that Mahela Jayawardene was a better captain than Arjuna Ranatunga.         
	Mahelas match reading abilities were far better than anyone elses, he said.

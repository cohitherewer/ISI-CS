The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kohlis composed display impressed

	India, having won the one-day series, may well go on to try some newcomers in the final one-dayer in Delhi. The team to Bangladesh has been announced and so there is an opportunity to see how someone like Sudeep Tyagi would take the pressure of batsmen going after him.         
	Of course one game is never a good indication of a players skills and temperament, but if he bowls well then he has begun well too.         
	Ishant Sharma being left out of the one-day side was no surprise after he got belted all around the ground by the Sri Lankans. But then he wasnt the only one who got pasted by Dilshan amp; Co.         
	What was surprising that Ishant was preferred to Tyagi after being left out of the squad for the first two one dayers and it was only when Sreesanth fell ill that he came back and went on to play in the next two ahead of the Uttar Pradesh medium pacer.         
	It is this which is hard to understand, for, if a player is already in the squad then how come an outsider gets preference while the former gets to cool his heels in the dressing room?         
	Be that as it may, the Indian batsmen have ensured that they have added a one-day series win to the Test series win against the Lankans and it is most crucial that they do not relax and allow the Lankans to narrow the margin of defeat to 3-2 at the Kotla.         
	The Delhi game also sees the comeback of skipper Dhoni.         
	Sehwag led the team admirably in his two games as stand-in skipper and that also is encouraging, for, there is a ready-made skipper in case, God forbid, an injury happens to Dhoni.         
	The Gambhir-Kohli partnership was a superbly crafted one where they bided their time and looked for the ones and twos. It was such a good approach that it showed that these two can be relied upon in a sticky situation.         
	Kohli, in particular, was the one to admire as he curbed his natural instinct, played himself in and then began to unfurl a wider range of shots.         
	The Delhi boy should not show any emotion if he misses out on a scoring opportunity because if he stays at the crease those will come again. By showing his frustration he will actually be giving hope to the bowlers.         
	He is still a kid at the international level so he will learn and what was impressive was that there was no over-the-top celebration when he reached his first ODI hundred. It was a composed display and augurs well for the future.         
	What can one add to the kudos Gautam Gambhir is getting for his selfless gesture in handing over the Man of the Match award to his young partner.         
	Here is a player who has matured beyond imagination and is still keen on learning to get better and in doing so has shown leadership qualities too.         
	He has had a fabulous year with the bat and in the last game of the year he will be hoping to finish off with another big one and take India to a comprehensive series win.

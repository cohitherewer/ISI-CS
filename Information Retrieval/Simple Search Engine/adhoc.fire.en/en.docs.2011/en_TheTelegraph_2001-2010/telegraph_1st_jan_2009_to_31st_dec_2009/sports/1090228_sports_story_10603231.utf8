The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni puts on a brave face
                                                   Dhoni puts on a brave face
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Wellington: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni did not look a frustrated man after losing the second Twenty International, and therefore, the series here Friday.         
	He admitted that the batsmen could have done better but praised his teammates for their efforts on the field. Dhoni added that the team is well-prepared for the ODI series.               
	The following are excerpts         
	His take on the match         
	It was quite a close match. That is what Twenty20 cricket is all about. Its not just about huge hits, but also plenty of wickets, some big sixes. You want the game to go down to the wire. When we got 150, most people would have thought that New Zealand would win in 15 or 16 overs. I am really proud of the side, the way we came back after the first three or four overs. I thought Harbhajan and Jadeja were fantastic. It was sad to lose Ishant to a shoulder injury In batting, we can do better. We are a much more talented batting unit.         
	On the batting failure         
	Our batting was perhaps a replay of the first game. We lost wickets quickly again. When Yuvi and I were batting, we were comfortably placed.         
	On Brendon McCullum         
	McCullum batted brilliantly in both the games, he carried his bat through the innings and the others were batting around him. That is precisely what you require as a team.         
	On New Zealand         
	New Zealand played better. Their bowlers bowled in the right areas consistently, and bowled a lot of yorkers.         
	If he is happy with the teams performance         
	I am not an angry captain. I am not too worried about the result, I am more concerned about the commitment and the effort. I believe the players gave more than a 100 per cent.         
	On the bottles thrown onto the ground         
	Thats really sad. You dont want bottles to be thrown around in a cricket match. The cricket ball is enough to hurt you, as it is. My fear is that it is a bit like a disease, once you throw a bottle, it spreads. I dont want it to happen. Maybe it calls for more effort from the security staff. As it is, with people shouting at you from beyond the boundary, there is enough distraction. Hopefully, they wont throw bottles anymore.         
	On Ravindra Jadeja         
	We have created a space for him. Given our one-day eleven, it is very difficult to make space for him right now. Jadeja is definitely a good talent, an amazing fielder, too. This tour will give him a lot of confidence.         
	The T20 series as preparation for the ODIs         
	It is great to play a few T20 games before the one-dayers. I am happy with the preparation and the effort. Most of the guys have spent reasonable time at the wicket. They know how the wickets will behave and this will be of great help when the one-day series starts.

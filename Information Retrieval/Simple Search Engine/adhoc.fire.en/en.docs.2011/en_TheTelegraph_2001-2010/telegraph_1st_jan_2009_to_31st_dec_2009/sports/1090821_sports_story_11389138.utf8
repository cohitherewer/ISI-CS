            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: A couple of years ago, when the All India Football Federation (AIFF) decided to revive the ONGC-Nehru Cup, Syria were the most exciting side in the five-nation meet. That India could beat them in the final was considered a huge achievement then.         
	However, the story wasnt the same when Syria took on Kyrgyzstan in the second match of the Nehru Cup at the Ambedkar Stadium on Thursday. The tournaments only top-hundred team in the Fifa rankings, Syria didnt display the sparkle they were expected to and earned an ordinary 2-0 victory.         
	Mohamed Alzinos ninth-minute goal was perhaps the only good thing to happen in the otherwise insipid encounter. As Moutaz Kaildni floated a chest-high cross from the right, Alzino came rushing to beat the goalkeeper Pavel Matisah with a perfect header.         
	In the 67th minute Roman Ablakimov committed a vicious foul on Abdul Fatah Alaga and was promptly given marching orders by referee Pratap Singh. It was Alaga who then struck the second for Syria after getting past a couple of defenders. Bob Houghton had a close look at the match, perhaps to judge Kyrgyzstans strength. For both India and Kyrgyzstan, it could be a do or die encounter Saturday.

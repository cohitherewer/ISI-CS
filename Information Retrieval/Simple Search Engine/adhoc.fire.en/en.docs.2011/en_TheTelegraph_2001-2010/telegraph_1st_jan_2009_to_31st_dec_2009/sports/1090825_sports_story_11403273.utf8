                                                   Elena   spoils   Maria   party
                                        
	Toronto: Russian fourth seed Elena Dementieva picked up her third title of the year and denied compatriot Maria Sharapova a comeback win with a 6-4, 6-3 victory in the final of the Toronto Cup Sunday.         
	Dementievas victory was just the third in nine meetings against Sharapova, who was playing for a title for the first time since Amelia Island in April 2008 as she continued her return from shoulder surgery.         
	It is the 14th career title for Dementieva and comes with a good omen, the three past winners of the Toronto tournament have gone on to capture the US Open.         
	I felt like Lleyton Hewitt today, I was fighting for every point, so many long rallies, its not the game I like to play, Dementieva told reporters. I was just waiting for my chances and didnt rush.         
	This kind of win gives you a lot of confidence, so right now it is all about recovery and getting ready for New York.         
	Working her way back to top form after nine months on the sidelines, Sharapova has made steady progress since she launched her comeback in May.         
	But the three-time Grand Slam winner showed in an uneven final that her game still needs sharpening as she served up nine double faults to Dementieva in the opening set.

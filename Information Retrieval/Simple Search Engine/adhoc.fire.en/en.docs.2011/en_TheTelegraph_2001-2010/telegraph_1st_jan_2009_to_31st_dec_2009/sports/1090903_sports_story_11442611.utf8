The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Windies crisis continues 
                                                   Windies crisis continues 
                      
	Kingston: Talks to resolve the contract row between the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) and the West Indies Players Association (WIPA) have failed with mediator Shridath Ramphal confessing that the matter was likely to deteriorate further.         
	It was another bad day for West Indian cricket, which, without fundamental changes, is now likely to deteriorate further, Ramphal was quoted as saying by the a local daily.         
	The former Commonwealth Secretary General was appointed on July 21 to mediate in the dispute which erupted when 13 of the leading West Indies players boycotted the first Test against Bangladesh, citing pay and contract issues.         
	Ramphal was appointed after current Caricom chairman and Guyana President Bharrat Jagdeo met top representatives from both sides.         
	Although Ramphal claimed he was close to brokering peace between the two sides, the situation changed when one party (apparently the WICB) introduced an entirely new document and refused to negotiate on it. Besides, the WICB selected a B team for the Champions Trophy in South Africa.         
	The president (of the Board) later apologised for the omission but the damage had been done. Mediation was weakened from the start, Jagdeo said in a statement. I am disappointed to learn of the failure (of the WICB and the WIPA in reaching an agreement) I am not wholly surprised.         
	Jagdeo added that, Caricom governments will have to consider what next to save West Indies cricket, and West Indians everywhere, from still further humiliation. Now, it seems that the mediation has been the victim of the same spirit of the Board insistences that it had its own way.         
	Meanwhile, the out-of-action West Indies cricketers must play in an annual limited overs tournament in Guyana in late October to qualify for selection for future series, a top official said Wednesday.         
	Chetram Singh, president of the Guyana Cricket Board, told reporters Wednesday that star players must suit up for the tournament in Guyana beginning Oct. 27 or be deemed ineligible for selection for upcoming series, including a highly anticipated clash with Australia in November.

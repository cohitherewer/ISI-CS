	Hyderabad: Dhawal Kulkarni claimed five wickets as Mumbai asserted their supremacy by thrashing Uttar Pradesh by a huge 243-run margin and clinching the Ranji Trophy title for a record 38th time here Friday.         
	Needing an improbable 525 to win the match on the last day, Uttar Pradesh folded up for 281 in 71.5 overs even though the last wicket pair of Amir Khan (43) and Praveen Gupta (25) delayed the inevitable by stitching a 55-run partnership.         
	The young Kulkarni was the pick of the Mumbai bowlers with five for 76 while spinner Ramesh Powar chipped in with three wickets at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium at Uppal.         
	Kulkarni removed Gupta to take the last wicket as the tired-looking UP batsman lazily drove a delivery outside the off-stump to first slip where substitute Sahil Kukreja grabbed it, triggering celebrations in the Mumbai dressing room.         
	Mumbai had scored 402 and extended their 177-run first innings lead with a big second-innings score of 367.         
	Mumbai dominated the first session by reducing UP to 55 for four but skipper Mohammed Kaif and Bhuvneshwar Kumar added 65 runs to lend some stability to the UP innings.                     
	With another 402 required to win in two sessions, Khan and Gupta frustrated Mumbai bowlers scoring 47 runs in less than 10 overs. As the bowlers got tired, captain Wasim Jaffer brought Sachin Tendulkar on but the move did not work as UP went to tea at 273 for nine.         
	Amir Khan was dropped in the 71st over off a Tendulkar delivery. The UP batsmen scored 150 in the second session.         
	Kulkarni had started the rot sending opener Shivkant Shukla back in the sixth over of the day.         
	Shukla, who played the most important role in UPs run to the final, guided the ball straight to Rohit Sharma at gully.         
	Kulkarni then picked up Suresh Raina, who went for a cut and edged to Tendulkar in the slips.         
	Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar scalped the other two wickets of Tanmay Srivastava and Parvinder Singh in the morning session. Kulkarni later took the wickets of Bhuvneshwar and R.P. Singh.         
	Jaffer, lifting the winners trophy, said: I thought UP bowled really well in the first session on the first day but Rohit and Nayar brought us back to into the game.         
	Jaffer picked Rohit and Zaheer for special mention.         
	Rohit scored a 100 in each innings. We all know Zaheer. He single-handedly turned the match in the first innings. And Rohit, the kind of form he is in, I feel he scores runs when it matters, Jaffer said.         
	Among the youngsters, Dhawal Kulkarni and Ajinkya Rahane have done well, he added.         
	Jaffer said he had been hoping to win the title since the start of the tournament.         
	I am feeling great. This is what we had been aiming for when I took over the captaincy. We had planned this for a long time, before the start of the season. The hard work has paid off, he said.         
	As UP finished runners-up for the second successive year, Kaif admitted that the fielding lapses which included a reprieve to Rohit, hurt them badly.         
	We fielded first to get some early wickets and we werent good with the fielding. Shukla batted well for us, he said.           (PTI)

	The venue of the tournament, which will see seven one-day Internationals among Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, will be decided later.         
	It wasnt easy finding a window in the busy international schedules of these countries, yet all the Boards were extremely co-operative and keen for the tournament to go ahead. So it was done with the good graces of all concerned, ACC chief executive Syed Ashraful Huq said in a statement.         
	Sri Lanka won the 2008 edition, held in Pakistan, while India were the runners-up. India and Sri Lanka have won the tournament four times each. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Trophy our next target, says Younis
                                                   Trophy our next target, says Younis
                      
	Karachi: Younis Khans dream is to win the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy or the 2011 World Cup during his tenure as Pakistan captain.         
	Besides, Younis said that his burning desire was to see Pakistan win Test series in Australia and India.         
	Every captain has certain targets in mind. And mine is to win these two major ICC events as a captain, Younis told reporters at the start of the second phase of the Champions Trophy conditioning camp Sunday.         
	We are going to Australia later this year and we have never won a Test series there. I think this time we have the best chance of achieving this feat. Beating Australia in Australia is something special and I have always dreamed off, he added.         
	The senior batsman said that Pakistan had a strong line up of players for every form but the real issue was to get them to click collectively. We have the players to win the Champions Trophy or World Cup and even beat Australia in Australia but we need to combine and click together, he said.         
	According to Younis, a Test series against India was always a big thing for him and he hoped that while he was captain bilateral cricket relations with India would be revived.         
	I would love to lead the team in a full series against India as beating them would be a big achievement for me and a big plus in my career, he said. Younis said Pakistan had the potential to top their group in the Champions Trophy despite the presence of India and Australia.         
	When our team is clicking well and playing with confidence and on a high it does not matter how many teams we have in our group. Even if they are six we can still qualify for the semi-finals, the 31-year old said.

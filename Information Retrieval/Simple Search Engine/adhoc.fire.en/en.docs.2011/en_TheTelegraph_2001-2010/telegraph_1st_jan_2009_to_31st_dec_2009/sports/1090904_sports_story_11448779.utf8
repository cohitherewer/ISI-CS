The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Alls well with Rafael Nadal 
                                                   Alls well with Rafael Nadal 
            CHRISTOPHER CLAREY                      
	New York: Exceptionally supportive when Richard Gasquet tested positive for cocaine earlier this year, Rafael Nadal was not nearly so helpful on the court during Gasquets return to Grand Slam tennis on Wednesday.         
	Nadal beat the erratic and tentative Gasquet 6-2, 6-2, 6-3, in the first round at the US Open. But then this was also Nadals return to Grand Slam tennis: his first opportunity to chart a new course in the majors after losing for the first time at the French Open and then making the wrenching decision not to try to defend his title at Wimbledon.         
	The primary problem for Nadal was the latest flare-up of tendinitis in both knees; the secondary one was the emotional fallout of his parents separation. In an injury-riddled sport in which comebacks have become commonplace, Nadals return hardly belongs in that category. He was not gone that long.         
	One month and a half outside of competition, thats all, he said.         
	But considering how much has happened during his layoff, it did indeed feel like a different era as Nadal walked briskly into Arthur Ashe Stadium in the sunshine to start play in the only Grand Slam tournament he has not won.         
	With Nadal eliminated, Roger Federer won the French Open for the first time. Then, in Nadals absence at Wimbledon, he established a benchmark for excellence by winning his mens record 15th Grand Slam singles title. Also during this time, Andy Murray broke up the long-running Federer-Nadal rankings duopoly by rising to No. 2.         
	But Nadal, even at No. 3 and not quite at his relentless best, was far too much for Gasquet to handle, whipping ground strokes, scampering about the deep blue surface with no tape on either knee and holding serve with no drama as he did not allow Gasquet a break point.         
	That was a tribute to Nadals biting left-handed serve and a reflection of the dubious form of the 46th-ranked Gasquet.         
	After testing positive for a low level of cocaine in Miami after withdrawing from the Sony Ericsson Open in March, Gasquet pleaded his case with anti-doping authorities, saying the cocaine entered his system when he kissed a woman who had used the drug.         
	Gasquet could have been suspended for two years, but he was given a two-and-a-half-month suspension by an independent, three-member panel in July.         
	The International Tennis Federation is appealing the reduced suspension to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which means the possibility remains that Gasquets results for the rest of this season could be retroactively wiped out.         
	Im not thinking about that, Gasquet said. Im just happy to be back practising and playing again.         
	Gasquet played two qualifying-round matches in New Haven last month, but the match on Wednesday was his first in the main draw of an event since May, a stretch that he maintains has been the most difficult of his life.         
	But Nadal helped generate some sunshine among the dark clouds by expressing his belief in Gasquets innocence at the French Open.         
	I would have loved not to play Rafa already, because hes a great player and also because he did me a whole lot of good mentally when I was hurting, Gasquet said on Wednesday.         
	He allowed me to have better days. Its always good to have support. It was really a pleasure to hear what he said, so it wasnt easy for me to play him. In tennis terms, he was better than me, too, today.         
	The lopsided result was no surprise to those who have followed the arc of their lopsided rivalry.         
	Outstanding juniors in Europe, they first played before they were teenagers, and though there was hope in France that Gasquet might prove to be a world beater when he grew up, Nadal has now won all seven of their matches as professionals. He will face Nicolas Kiefer, a German veteran, in the second round.         
	I felt good, very positive, said Nadal, who said he played without pain in his knees.         
	I served well. The backhand was working well, the forehand more or less. I think everything was good, but the forehand can get better.                   NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

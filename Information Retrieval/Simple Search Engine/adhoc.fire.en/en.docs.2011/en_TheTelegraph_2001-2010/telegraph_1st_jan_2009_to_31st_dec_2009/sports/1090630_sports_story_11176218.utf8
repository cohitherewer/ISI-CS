	 ICC appoints officials for Ashes
    Calcutta: New Zealands Jeff Crowe and Sri Lankas Ranjan Madugalle were on Monday appointed Match Referees for the Ashes series commencing from July 8 in Cardiff, England. West Indian Billy Doctrove, Aleem Dar and Asad Rauf of Pakistan, New Zealands Billy Bowden and South African Rudi Koertzen will be the umpires for the series.

	 Paul view
    London: Cricket Australias anti-sledging diktat notwithstanding, senior England batsman Paul Collingwood still expects Ricky Pontings men to be verbally aggressive in the upcoming Ashes series. The Aussies are very good at sledging. I played a lot of cricket out there as a youngster, and they come hard at you. Its in their culture from a very early age. They dont like Pommies, simple as that. And when they sniff a moment, they think, Right, we can get on top here, Collingwood said.               
	 Kevon Plan
    Birmingham: Kevin Pietersen will rely on advice from friends in the South African team when he faces a new-look Australia in the opening Ashes Test in Cardiff on July 8, the England batsman said on Monday. I have had a lot of communication with (Jacques) Kallis and (Mark) Boucher. A lot of it was very, very useful, Pietersen said.               
	 Gillespie point
    Sydney: Former Australia fast bowler Jason Gillespie said Monday that it was English conditions and not fitness issues that pose a challenge to pacer Brett Lee ahead of the Ashes. Lees new-ball potency is under scrutiny after he failed to get a wicket in his opening spell in either innings of Australias tourmatch against Sussex over the weekend. He said Lee has struggled on his two previous Ashes tours, claiming 29 wickets in 10 Tests at an average of more than 45 while conceding well above four runs an over.               
	 Watson in
    Sydney: Australian all-rounder Shane Watson has been named in the New South Wales squad for the 2009/10 season, Cricket New South Wales said on Monday. Watson, who is struggling with a knee problem ahead of Australias Ashes series opener in England next week, has switched states from Queensland and is one of 10 NSW players contracted by Cricket Australia.               
	 Gloster advice
    Jaipur: Indian cricketers should opt out of the Indian Premier League (IPL) if a major international tournament is scheduled immediately after it, said the teams former physio John Gloster. Gloster said players should avoid tournaments like the IPL to make sure that they are at the peak of their physical and mental fitness before a crucial international tournament like the World Cup. Skip IPL if possible. Some of the Australians skipped it, he said.

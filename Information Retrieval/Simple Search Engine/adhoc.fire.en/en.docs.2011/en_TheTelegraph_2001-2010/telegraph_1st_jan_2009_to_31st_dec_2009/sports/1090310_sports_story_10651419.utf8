The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mendis still in hospital
                                                     Mendis still in hospital
    - No move to get anybody from overseas to help in healing process: SLC             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ajantha Mendis                                       
	Calcutta: Star spinner Ajantha Mendis, who underwent surgery on returning home after last Tuesdays terror strike in Lahore, is still in Colombos Nawaloka Hospital.         
	While the Sri Lanka cricketers dont have national engagements till the ICC World T20 meet in the first week of June, Mendis (and some of his compatriots) have Indian Premier League commitments to fulfil from next month.         
	Mendis is on the rolls of the Shah Rukh Khan-owned Kolkata Knight Riders. He was taken on board rather late in the inaugural season, last year, but is expected to be one of the impact-players in edition No.2.         
	I cant give you the exact date for Ajanthas discharge Perhaps, in another couple of days The area (lower part of the head, right side) requires regular dressings, something which cant be done in his house, the premier hospitals medical administrator told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Monday afternoon, the gentleman (who didnt wish to be named) added: The assistant coach, Paul (Farbrace), may also be released in a day or two Right now, he too needs regular dressings, on the right hand         
	Middle-order bat Thilan Samaraweera, who required surgery to extricate a bullet from his left lower thigh, will be hospitalised for much longer.         
	Again, the medical administrator couldnt put a date for Samaraweeras discharge.         
	The other Sri Lanka players, who were admitted to Nawaloka immediately after returning home early on Wednesday, had been released either that day itself or the next morning.         
	Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) chief executive Duleep Mendis has clarified that there were no plans to invite a swamiji from India to help the Mahela Jayawardenes recover from their traumatic experience, which led to the loss of eight Pakistani lives.         
	We do have plans to involve local experts in the healing process, yes, but theres no move to get anybody from overseas Certainly not at the moment, that is, Mendis said, when contacted in Colombo.         
	On Sunday, however, an agency report had quoted Dr Geethanjana Mendis, director-general of the sports ministrys medical unit, as saying that a swamiji would indeed be invited from India.         
	Also, that the advice for doing so had come from no less a person than Sri Lankas President, Mahinda Rajapakse.         
	Counselling, though, is planned across continents. Australian umpire Simon Taufel (who was also lucky), for example, intends involving his family too.         
	Unlike whats being put in place in Colombo, by SLC, Taufel is acting in his individual capacity.

                                                     Buchanan: Id like to develop leaders
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            John Buchanan and Sourav Ganguly                           
	Calcutta: Exactly a day after Bangalore Royal Challengers owner Vijay Mallya confirmed that Rahul Dravid wouldnt be his teams captain in IPL 2009, Kolkata Knight Riders cricket manager John Buchanan triggered speculation on his teams captaincy.         
	Sourav Ganguly had been at the helm in the T20 tournaments inaugural edition, last year.         
	Reacting to a question on captaincy, during an interaction with the media here on Sunday, Buchanan said: Were still undecided on the leadership issue         
	Later, speaking to The Telegraph, Buchanan (international crickets most successful coach) explained that he wanted to approach the captaincy issue a little differently and wanted to develop leaders.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Look, Id like to approach the captaincy issue a little differently Take a slightly different view and that has nothing to do with individuals and is certainly not intended to slight Sourav in any way         
	Of course, those are my thoughts, but Ive spoken about them to Sourav and some of the (Knight Riders) seniors I should add its still being discussed and nothing has been cast in stone         
	Its possible that the coach, Matthew Mott, could be the captain when the teams batting  for, somebody who has just got out or is anxiously waiting to take guard, may not be in the best frame of mind to take critical (batting-related) decisions Ive tried that in Queensland         
	Equally, its possible that the captaincy could be rotated during the period that the team is on the field As Ive said, at this stage, its only a possibility and should be treated that way         
	Ideally, Id like a group of leaders on the park, with all having the ability to captain Id really like to develop leaders         
	Well, then, expect something radical (courtesy Buchanan) when IPL 2009 gets under way.

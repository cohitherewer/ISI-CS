The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhutia scores but India lose
                                                     Bhutia scores but India lose
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bhaichung Bhutia                           
	New Delhi: India went down 1-2 to hosts Hong Kong in a friendly at the Mong Kok Stadium on Wednesday.         
	According to reports reaching here, Hong Kong, who are ranked 10 places below India (142) in the latest Fifa rankings, dominated the outing and clinched the winner during injury time.         
	Watched by around 5,000 people, most of whom were Indians, the visitors were able to keep the rival strikers at bay for most part of the encounter.         
	India restored parity through Bhaichung Bhutia before Ng Wai Chiu beat custodian Subrata Paul inside the box in the 93rd minute.         
	Paul, however, had a great match under the bar and came up with some fine saves to thwart the Hong Kong strikers on several occasions.         
	It was Indias first defeat in an international match since they went down to the Maldives in the SAFF Cup final in Colombo last year.         
	India, who regained some of their lost prestige at the Asian level after winning the AFC Challenge Cup last August, were nowhere near their best on Wednesday and could have lost by a bigger margin.         
	The chilly weather also caused discomfort to the Indian boys.         
	After a barren first half, the hosts increased pressure and shot into the lead in the 70th minute through Yiu Chung Au.         
	India restored parity nine minutes later when skipper Bhutia found the net with a low shot after substitute Mahesh Gawli initiated the move from the defence.         
	It was a balanced match and they could score the matchwinner only in the 93rd minute, said coach Bob Houghton.         
	Overall, our boys produced a decent performance.         
	In the second half, India made three changes to the team, bringing in Mahesh Gawli, Rakesh Masih and Abhishek Yadav in place of Deepak Mondal, NP Pradeep and Sunil Chhetri, respectively.         
	Debutant Anthony Pereira had a good match and Bob Houghton kept him on for the entire duration.         
	The last time India met Hong Kong was in the Asian Games in Doha in 2006.The match ended 1-1.               
	INDIA TEAM         
	Subrata Paul; Deepak Mondal (Mahesh Gawli 57th), Gourmangi Singh and Anwar Ali; Steven Dias, NP Pradeep (Rakesh Masih, 57th), Climax Lawrence and Anthony Pereira; Sunil Chhetri (Abhishek Yadav, 88th) and Bhaichung Bhutia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Probe into Wozniacki withdrawal
                                                   Probe into Wozniacki withdrawal

	Caroline Wozniacki, the womens world No. 6, is under investigation by the tennis authorities after controversially withdrawing from her first-round match in the Luxembourg Open on Tuesday.         
	Wozniackis withdrawal from her match against Anne Kremer, ostensibly through injury, prompted complaints and allegations on internet betting forums.         
	The Danish top seed, who won the first set 7-5 and was on the brink of victory despite clearly struggling with a leg injury, withdrew after apparently being instructed by her coach and father, Piotr Wozniacki, to quit in the final set.         
	On Wednesday night, Wozniacki admitted that she withdrew to allow Kremer to play in the following round. I did not think I could play the second round, so I chose the sporting option, to let her proceed. She is playing at home, she told a Danish newspaper.         
	Piotr issued his instruction after coming on to the court with his daughter leading 3-0 in the second set. As is common in WTA tournaments, he was wearing a microphone and his instruction, issued in his native Polish, was heard by gamblers watching the match live on the internet.         
	With Wozniacki 100-1 on to win the match on Betfair, a number of gamblers immediately laid her to lose or backed Kremer at 40-1.         
	The WTA confirmed that it was investigating the circumstances surrounding the match and that the matter could be passed to the sports Anti-Corruption Unit if there were any suspicious circumstances.         
	Wozniacki has rejected any suggestion of a link to gambling, and said that her intention had been to allow her opponent to contest the second-round match rather than proceed herself only to default.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We need miracle: Benitez
                                                                                                                                   We need miracle: Benitez
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Rafael Benitez has admitted his Liverpool team are in need of a miracle if they are to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League after Lisandros controversial injury-time equaliser for Lyon took their fate out of their hands.         
	Liverpool will be eliminated, regardless of their own results, should Fiorentina beat Lyon in Italy in 19 days time, while if the two sides draw, Liverpool will still need to beat the Italian side by three clear goals at Anfield in the final round of fixtures.         
	So remote are their chances of escaping that one bookmakers has lengthened their odds of winning the competition from 20/1 to 50/1.         
	It is difficult, but not impossible, said the Liverpool manager.         
	We have to win our next game (against Debrecen) and then see what happens in the last game, depending on the result between Lyon and Fiorentina. We cannot talk about them, though, if we do not do our job.         
	We have to keep going. I dont think my job is on the line, all I think about is the next game. We have produced miracles before, and maybe we can do it again.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brendon sets up win
                                                     Brendon sets up win
                  Suresh Raina in Christchurch on Wednesday                     
	Christchurch: Suresh Rainas fighting unbeaten 61 went in vain as world champions India began their New Zealand tour on a dismal note with the hosts thrashing them by seven wickets in the first Twenty20 match here Wednesday.         
	Put into bat, India recovered from a mid-innings slump to post a competitive 162 for eight but that proved insufficient as the Black Caps overhauled the target with seven balls to spare.         
	Brendon McCullam (56 not out), Martin Guptill (41), Ross Taylor (31) and Jacob Oram (29 not out) were the notable performers for the hosts who are 1-0 ahead in the two-match series.         
	India started off with a flourish but failed to sustain the tempo to find themselves in trouble at 61 for five by the eighth over. Some lusty hitting by Raina and Harbhajan Singh (21) towards the end provided some respectability to the total.         
	Raina and Harbhajan stitched together 61 runs for the eighth wicket, the highest partnership in the innings.         
	Ishant Sharma then struck with the first ball of his first over, trapping left-handed Jesse Ryder (1) to give India the kind of start they needed. Martin Guptill could have been back in the hut in the very next ball but New Zealand umpire Evan Watkin was not impressed with the appeal.         
	Replacing Ryder at the wicket, Guptill offered no shot to one which came back in and could have castled his stumps but Watkin thought otherwise. Television replays also showed that the ball could have knocked down the off-stump.         
	The hosts moved steadily towards the target as Guptill and Brendon McCullum batted smartly, avoiding risks and putting bad balls to the fence.         
	The Black Caps crossed the 50-run mark without losing any more wicket. Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, making a comeback to the side, provided the breakthrough when he trapped well-set Guptill to keep India afloat.         
	Before departing, Guptill hit four fours and three sixes and shared a 54-run stand with McCullum. Building on the good start, Ross Taylor and McCullum carted the Indian bowlers all around the park.         
	Taylor hit Yusuf Pathan for two sixes and one four in the 12th over to bring up 100 for the hosts.         
	As the match yet again tilted towards the hosts, Zaheer Khan dismissed Taylor (31), raising Indian hopes once again.         
	But in the end McCullum and Jacob Oram romped home without any difficulty.   
	Highlights  
	 Twenty four sixes were hit in the match, the most in T20   Internationals. The previous best was 20 sixes by India and Australia in Durban, September 22, 2007.
  India recorded 13 sixes in the innings, the most hit by India in a single innings in T20 
  Internationals.

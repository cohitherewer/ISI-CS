The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Easy wins for Blues, Spurs 
                                                   Easy wins for Blues, Spurs 
                      
	London: Tottenham Hotspur maintained their perfect start to the season when they came from behind to win 2-1 at West Ham United and stay top of the Premier League on Sunday.         
	Spurs were joined on nine points by Chelsea who also won their third successive league match with a 2-0 victory at near-neighbours Fulham, while promoted Burnley followed up their shock 1-0 win over Manchester United on Wednesday with another 1-0 victory over Everton.         
	Chelsea made the short trip back to Stamford Bridge with all three points after goals from Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka secured victory at Fulham.         
	Drogba put Chelsea ahead after 39 minutes when he was played through by Anelka and slotted the ball past Mark Schwarzer with Anelka making sure of the points by scoring after a quick Chelsea breakaway 14 minutes from time.         
	Burnley overcame Everton courtesy of a 34th minute Wade Elliott goal.

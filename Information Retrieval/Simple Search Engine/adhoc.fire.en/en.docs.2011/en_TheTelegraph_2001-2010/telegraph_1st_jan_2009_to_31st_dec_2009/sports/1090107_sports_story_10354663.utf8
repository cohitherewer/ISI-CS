	Sydney: South Africa coach Micky Arthur doesnt rule out the possibility of an injured Graeme Smith coming out to bat on the final day if the situation so demands.         
	I doubt Smith will come out. If there is one or two overs to see out a draw or a win, we are going to need a chain to chain him down in the dressing room, Arthur said.         
	Already battling an elbow injury, Smith sustained another blow when a Mitchell Johnson delivery hurt his finger, forcing the South African captain to retire hurt in the first innings.         
	His finger still in cast, Smith didnt take to the field Tuesday. Instead, Morne Morkel, who batted at No. 8 in the first innings, came out as a makeshift opener along with acting captain Neil McKenzie but the ploy fell flat on its face with Morkel perishing for a second ball duck.         
	Chasing 376 runs, South Africa were 62 for one at stumps, still 314 runs away from victory.         
	Im not taking the possibility out of the equation but it is highly unlikely, Arthur added.         
	The South African said he was surprised to see Ricky Ponting declaring and setting South Africa a sub-400 target.         
	I was (surprised) I thought they would go a little bit longer to be honest. I thought based on what has happened through the series they would look at 400, Arthur said.         
	Arthur felt Ponting probably did the right thing because it would not be easy cleaning up the remaining South African wickets even on a tricky fifth day track.         
	I also thought they would probably give themselves 16 overs (to the close of play.) That was what we thought and I think it is a great decision.         
	Ricky has realised the wicket has not deteriorated as much and it probably takes a little bit more time to bowl us out, Arthur said.         
	The cracks all over the track has made life difficult for the batsmen but Arthur didnt sound too worried with it.         
	When the Australians started their innings (they) used the heavy roller and again this morning it just seemed to just tighten the wicket together a bit.         
	We thought we would do the same and bar one ball from Andrew McDonald there was nothing that really went up and own and really dramatic. I hope the trend continues.         
	Johnson and Siddle have really impressed us through this series and those two guys are going to be the key for Australia, he said.         
	Arthur said the team would see where it reaches at tea before pushing for a win.         
	If we can get ourselves to tea, hopefully if we are unscathed at tea time... Then we will be ready to launch a proper assault, he said.         
	Let me tell you there is a dressing room full of guys there who dont want to give an inch, added Arthur. (PTI)

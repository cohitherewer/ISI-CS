                                                     Bhajji moves up to 7th spot
            A STAFF REPORTER            Harbhajan Singh                           
	Calcutta: Team India opener Gautam Gambhir retained his 10th spot while teammate Harbhajan Singh moved up one place to seventh in the Reliance Mobile ICC Test rankings released on Thursday.         
	The southpaw, who notched up 1134 runs in 2008, including three centuries in the last four Tests, is still the highest-ranked Indian batsman. His partner Virender Sehwag, who scored 1462 runs in the same period, is at the 13th spot, followed by Sachin Tendulkar and V.V.S. Laxman at joint 16th.         
	Harbhajan Singh (seventh) remained the only Indian in top 10 in the bowlers list with 686 rating points while pacer Zaheer Khan was at 12th with 630 points.         
	Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralidharan led the chart. However, South African Dale Steyn has narrowed the gap between himself and Muttiah Muralidharan. They are now 39 points apart. With both having two more Tests to play in their respective series, there is every chance that the gap will increase or decrease further.         
	Injured Brett Lee has dropped two places to ninth after a mediocre performance in the Melbourne Test.         
	West Indian Shivnarine Chanderpaul still heads the batsmens list while Australia captain Ricky Ponting managed to climb up to rankings to sixth. Michael Hussey has dropped out of top 10 after a run of low scores in the two Tests played so far against South Africa.         
	Hussey, now ranked 11th, still averages 59.04 but has only managed a total of 10 runs in his last four innings. The last time he was ranked this low was back in March 2006, when he was 14th.         
	Australia vice-captain Michael Clarke has reached the highest rating of his career to date (ninth) following the Melbourne Test, having climbed three places to break into the top 10.         
	Outside top 20, South Africas Jean-Paul Duminy climbed 62 places to 47th after his remarkable Test debut. Having played two Tests, the man from Cape Town is now averaging 108.50 after a great start to his career at the top level.

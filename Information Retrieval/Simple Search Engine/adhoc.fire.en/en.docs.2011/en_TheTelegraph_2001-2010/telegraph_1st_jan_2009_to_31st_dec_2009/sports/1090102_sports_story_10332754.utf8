                                                   Perfect 10 for Pulak
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Left-arm spinner Pulak Majumdar of Gymkhana Club created history by claiming 10 wickets in a CAB second division league match against Sahapur at the High Court ground on Thursday.         
	Pulak tore through Sahapurs batting during the latters chase of Gymkhanas total of 192 on Day II of the tie. In 22.5 overs, Pulak had bagged all 10 wickets, giving only 13 runs and bowling as many as 15 maidens. He thus became the second man from Bengal to achieve this feat after pacer Premangshu Chatterjee. Chatterjee in 1956 grabbed 10 wickets in a Ranji Trophy match against Assam at Jorhat. His figures were 19-11-20-10.         
	It really feels nice when you achieve such a feat I bagged nine wickets earlier but getting 10 wickets is like a dream come true for me, the 34-year old Pulak said after the feat on Thursday.         
	Pulak, who has played for the under-19 Bengal team, rued not getting a call to the Bengal senior squad. My dream was to play for Bengal But for whatever reasons I could not make it. But today I am happy that I have managed to fulfil one of my dreams, he said.         
	BRIEF SCORES: Gymkhana Club 192 vs Sahapur 83 (P. Majumdar 10/13). Gymkhana won by 109 runs.

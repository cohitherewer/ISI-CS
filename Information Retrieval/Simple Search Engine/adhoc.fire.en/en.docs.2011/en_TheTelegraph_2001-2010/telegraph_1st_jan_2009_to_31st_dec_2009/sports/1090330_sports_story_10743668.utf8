            A CORRESPONDENT            Gautam Gambhir exults after scoring a century on the fourth day of the second Test in Napier on Sunday. (AFP)                           
	Napier: Rahul Dravid showered praise on centurion Gautam Gambhir here on Sunday after India reached 252 for two in their second innings at the end of the fourth day of the second Test against New Zealand. However, Dravid said the job is only half-done and India cannot afford to relax if they are to save the Test.         
	Gambhir was undefeated on 102 while Sachin Tendulkar was not out on 58. Dravid himself scored a crucial 62 on a day when India fought hard.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Whether India are on track to save the match         
	It was a big step. It was a very good day for us. The way we played the first three days of the test, it was pretty disappointing. We spoke about the need for a big performance today (Sunday) and tomorrow (Monday), and weve got half the job done. We hope to have a good first session tomorrow. If we can do that, wed almost accomplish what best we could have done at the start of the day today.         
	What should Indias approach be in the first session on the last day?         
	Well, I think we know that NZ will come hard at us in the first two hours. That is their only chance. It has been a long time for them on the field. They have fought hard and they will go for one big effort and thats what we have to be wary of. We have to keep in mind that we cant afford to be complacent. We cannot think that this Test is over. We have to show the same mental discipline that we showed today. Sachin looks in great touch. Hopefully, they can carry on for the next couple of hours and then things will be a lot easier from there.         
	On the days play         
	Its been a hard-fought day for us and we have not been put in this situation for a long time. We found ourselves with our back to the wall, and we needed to show some character. We needed to fight and we did that. Its good that we can play different forms of the game differently. Hope we can keep doing that tomorrow.         
	On Gautam Gambhir         
	It was a mentally demanding day. I thought in the first session, New Zealand came out and bowled well. They knew they had a sniff and they had their tails up. They came and really challenged me and Gautam in the first session. We had to get through that session. Hats off to Gautam for being there at the end of the day. He showed at lot of character. A Test innings like this will take him a long way. Hell learn a lot from a day like this in Test cricket.         
	How is Gambhirs physical condition after such a gruelling day?         
	The physio had a tough day with him. Of course Gautam is tired. But there is no better feeling than the tiredness you feel after you have made a Test match hundred. I mean that is greatest tiredness in the world. Hes tired but he is also over the moon. He will recover tomorrow and he will be looking forward to spending a lot of time there.         
	On their partnership         
	I think there were phases when both of us were challenging each other. There are periods when you are batting in a long day. Its mentally draining. Your concentration does waver a bit. Gautam played really well.         
	What should Gambhir do to continue the good work on the last day?         
	Try and get a good night sleep. It wouldnt be easy for him, I can tell you that. It is never easy to sleep when you have batted the whole day. You are so tired mentally and the adrenaline is so high. But hes a tough kid. The key for him tomorrow will be to set small targets and not think about batting the whole day. I think he should not really think about his individual score. He should look at what the team needs from him. Thats what gives you the motivation. He has already got a hundred. If he looks at it from the teams perspective, I think that will push him more.         
	Did Indian batsmen curb their natural instincts?         
	I dont know what it means to play your natural game all the time. Youve got to play according to the situation. Thats what great players have done over the years. They read the situation, the wicket, the conditions and play accordingly. There cannot be only one way of playing the game. The great ones are those who can adapt and play according to the needs of the team.         
	If it was tough batting on this wicket         
	Not really. The surface has slowed down a bit there was a liitle bit of bounce in the wicket. To be fair to everyone, its a flat wicket and it has been a real batting beauty. Having said that, there is bounce in the wicket for bowlers who bend their backs.         
	If he is disappointed about missing out on a century         
	Well, I mean I have played Test cricket for a long time now. Ive been lucky sometimes and not so lucky on other occasions. You do get disappointed. But sometimes things go your way, sometimes they dont. Thats the way the sport is.         
	Which of his two innings in this Test was better?         
	The second one is a bit different. It was the second innings and we were trying to save the Test. In the first innings, we were trying to set up a game. So that knock was also important.         
	If there is any hope of winning this Test         
	Well, I mean you always start a Test wanting to win it. But it is not always going to happen.We know that we didnt have any chance to win the Test.         
	If India would consider making New Zealand bat again         
	No. If we can bat well in the first session, it will be ideal to make them bowl for 270 overs. Going into Wellington and being back on field after just three days would then be easy.

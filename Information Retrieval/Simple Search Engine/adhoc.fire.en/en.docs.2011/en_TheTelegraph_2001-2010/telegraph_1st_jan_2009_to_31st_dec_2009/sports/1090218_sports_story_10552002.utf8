The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rhythm is key: Balaji
                                                   Rhythm is key: Balaji
                                  Balaji    
	Chennai: Comeback man Lakshmipathy Balaji reckoned that it would be just a matter of finding a rhythm in New Zealand and wickets would automatically follow.         
	The lanky Tamil Nadu pacer said that he has regained the lost touch and is not perturbed either by the conditions in New Zealand or the varying tracks there.         
	I am not unduly worried about the pitches in New Zealand. Of course it is going to be challenging, particularly because of the weather. But as an international cricketer, I am confident of adapting to the conditions.         
	So if I maintain my rhythm, other things would fall in place, Balaji said.         
	Once he is on song, Balaji said neither the nature of the track nor the atmosphere could affect his rhythm.         
	The atmosphere around or the conditions of the pitch does not affect me or my rhythm. I just need to concentrate on maintaining the line and length and take wickets at regular intervals, he said.         
	Balaji appeared particularly happy the way his body has responded after returning from a stress fracture that threatened his career.         
	Since recovering from stress fracture and a back surgery later, I have bowled over 400 overs in domestic cricket. I have got back to my old ways of bowling, he said.         
	Balaji agreed that most of his teammates have no prior experience of playing in New Zealand but felt that the seniors would help the youngsters to overcome the problem. (PTI)

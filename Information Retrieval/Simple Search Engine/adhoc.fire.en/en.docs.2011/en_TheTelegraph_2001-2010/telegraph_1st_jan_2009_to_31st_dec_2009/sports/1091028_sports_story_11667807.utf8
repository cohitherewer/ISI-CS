                                                   PFC look for first victory 
                      
	Margao: Pune Football Club (PFC) having faced a defeat and three draws, are looking for a win when they meet defending champions Churchill Brothers in an I-League match at the Nehru Stadium here, on Wendesday.         
	Pune FC have played well as a team but somehow not been able to notch up a win after three draws from four matches. Coach Derrick Pereira, however, is confident that the elusive win will come.         
	The win will come for sure. We need to keep pressing for a result just. We need to keep the focus, and the result will surely go our way, said Pereira.         
	The boys gave a good account of themselves in all the three drawn matches, it is the lack of finishing that has let us down. Edmar, who did not get much support upfront in the last match will be looking for Jeje to compliment him.

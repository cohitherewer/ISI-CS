                                                   IPL is over for Tiwary 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Port Elizabeth: Manoj Tiwary, who led East Zone in the last Deodhar Trophy and is with the Delhi Daredevils in the IPL, will undergo surgery on his left hand in the next couple of days.         
	Tiwary hurt himself in the palm region while trying to stop an Andrew Flintoff hit off his own bowling during the Daredevils versus the Chennai Super Kings match, in Durban, on Thursday.         
	Its my bad luck... Kismat hi kharab hai... The surgery will be done in Johannesburg and Ill be out of action for four-six weeks... Im bitterly disappointed, a distraught Tiwary told The Telegraph on Sunday evening.         
	Tiwary had to return home from Bangladesh, before the ODIs there two years ago, after suffering a shoulder injury during a practice session. That was the first time hed made the senior squad.

                                                     Younis flays Aussies
                  Younis Khan                     
	Melbourne: Pakistan captain Younis Khan has blamed the Australians for unnecessarily creating issues while playing against India and Pakistan after teammate Saeed Ajmal was reported for a suspect bowling action during the ongoing one-day series.         
	Off-spinner Ajmal was reported for his bowling action during the second ODI in Dubai on April 24, which he had suggested resulted from a complaint by Australian all-rounder Shane Watson to the umpires.         
	Younis said controversies reared up whenever Australia play sub-continental sides and wondered what was wrong in Ajmal bowling a doosra, the subject of the reporting.         
	This is always happening with India and Pakistan and Australia, Younis said. ... Why do we create controversies all the time? Why? Its a fair game, you know, he fumed.         
	Younis said it was simply a matter of Ajmal bowling a quicker ball, and not cheating.         
	Youre talking about the doosra. Why (shouldnt) he (Ajmal) bowl doosra? This is an art and especially Pakistanis and Indians have the art, so why (should it) not be allowed? Younis was quoted as saying by an Australian agency.         
	Ajmal played in the third ODI in Abu Dhabi on Monday, despite the report hanging over him, and continued to bowl his doosra. (PTI)

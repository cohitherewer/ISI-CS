                                                                                                                       7                                      Media   on the street!
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The media had a harrowing time Tuesday as they were made to stand outside Taj Bengal, the official team hotel for several hours. What is worse, they were made to wait on the street!         
	Both the police and the hotel authorities, however, said that their hands were tied and that they were acting under specific instructions.         
	This was the first instance that mediapersons were not allowed inside the hotel during an international match in the city.         
	The norm that the hotel followed over the years was to cordon off an area inside the lobby where the media waited. This time, however, things took a turn for the worse.         
	The hotel authorities claimed that they were acting on instructions from the Calcutta Police. The police, on their part, stated that they were following instructions from the security officer of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), Lawrence Fernando.         
	The security officer on his recent recee of the venue had told the police that the hotel lobby should be clear and no makeshift arrangement would be allowed on the porch.         
	The mediapersons, especially photojournalists, had a torrid time as police even cordoned off a portion outside the entrance which prevented them for taking pictures when the team buses entered the hotel premises.

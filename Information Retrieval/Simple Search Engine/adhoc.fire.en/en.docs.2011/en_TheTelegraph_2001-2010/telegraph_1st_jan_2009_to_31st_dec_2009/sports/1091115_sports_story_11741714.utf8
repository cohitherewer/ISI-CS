	Dubai: World champion Pakistan won a record-equalling seventh successive Twenty20 match beating New Zealand by seven runs and swept the two-match series at Dubai Sports City Stadium on Friday.         
	Umar Akmal was the top-scorer with 56 in 49 balls as Pakistan reached 153-5 on a lively pitch.         
	The Black Caps put up a spirited fight. Stand-in captain Brendon McCullum (47) and Scott Styris (43) threatened to lead New Zealand to victory with a 66-run stand for the fourth wicket. However, the Pakistani bowlers led by paceman Umar Gul (2/29) kept their cool in the final overs.         
	With the victory, Pakistan matched South Africas record string from March to June this year.           (AP)

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) Chief Executives Committee (CEC) supported a request from the 2011 World Cup central organising committee that the host countries should play their quarter finals and semi-finals in their home country.         
	The CEC, which met at its fourth and last meeting of the year, in Dubai, recommended this proposal to the ICC Board which will hold its first of the four meetings of 2010, in February, in Dubai.         
	However, where two co-hosts are involved the higher-ranked side from the group stage will host the match, said the ICC release on Tuesday.         
	Two quarter finals are slated to be held in Bangladesh while India and Sri Lanka are scheduled to host the other two.         
	The semi-finals, according to the fixture, will be held in Ahmedabad (India) and Colombo (Sri Lanka) respectively.         
	In another important decision, a five-member committee, which also has BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan, has been formed to look into the context for Test and one-day International formats post 2012 Future Tour Programme.         
	The committee comprising David Richardson, David Collier, James Sutherland, Nishantha Ranatunga and Srinivasan will also draft a discussion paper for the CEC to consider at its next meeting.         
	The CEC approved the womens committees recommendation that the top four womens sides from the 2010 World Twenty20 in the West Indies will earn direct qualification for the next edition of the tournament in 2012 in Sri Lanka.         
	The remaining four teams will come through a qualification process.         
	Apart from granting ODI status to the Olympic Stadium in Sydney, the CEC also gave temporary ODI status to Kon. UD CC in Amsterdam for the Pepsi ICC World Cricket League to be staged in July next year.         
	The CEC also received an update report on the decision review system (DRS) which was implemented in the Dunedin (New Zealand vs Pakistan) and Brisbane (Australia vs West Indies) Tests and will also be used in South Africa.         
	Following the recent summit in Hyderabad, the CEC endorsed ICCs work to address and counteract online piracy.         
	The CEC meeting comprised of the chief executives of the 10 Test-playing members and three representatives from the ICC associate and affiliate members. Srinivasan, the BCCI secretary, represented India.         
	It was chaired by the ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat and also attended by the ICC president David Morgan.

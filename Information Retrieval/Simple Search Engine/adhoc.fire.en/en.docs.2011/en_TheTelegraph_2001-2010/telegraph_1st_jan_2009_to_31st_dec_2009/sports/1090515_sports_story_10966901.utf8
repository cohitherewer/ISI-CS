The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Taylor did it for us: Kumble
                                                   Taylor did it for us: Kumble
            OUR BUREAU                      
	Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Anil Kumble described Thursdays win against Chennai Super Kings in Durban as an important one for his side. He also praised Ross Taylors batting and the teams superb fielding.         
	It was so important, it was a fantastic effort. Our catching was brilliant, Kumble said after snapping Chennais five-match winning streak by defeating them by two wickets. In the end, Taylor did it for us, he added.         
	Kumble said the team executed their plans well, barring a few things. We wanted to get Haydos (Matthew Hayden) early but that did not happen. Still overall our plan was successful, he said.         
	The veteran leg-spinner did not wish to get carried away by the win saying, we would like to take one game at a time.         
	Chennai captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni blamed his teams laid-back fielding for breaking their winning streak in the IPL. Our fielding has been suspect in the tournament so far. You have to be fast and agile in the field. We have been a safe fielding side but not a brilliant one, Dhoni said.         
	The Chennai Super Kings captain felt an extra 20 runs could have helped the teams cause, and said if he had played patiently, that would have been possible.

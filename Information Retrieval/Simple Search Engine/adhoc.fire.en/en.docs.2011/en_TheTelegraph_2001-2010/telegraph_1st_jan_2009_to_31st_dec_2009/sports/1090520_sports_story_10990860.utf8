The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gayle: Playing a lot of cricket
                                                   Gayle: Playing a lot of cricket
                      
	Chester-le-Street: West Indies captain Chris Gayle admitted the volume of international cricket his side were being asked to play was starting to get to him following their Test series humbling by England.         
	Englands Test and one-day tour of the Caribbean only ended in April and the West Indies now have little time to rest before a three-match one-day series in England starts at Headingley on Thursday.         
	Then comes Junes World Twenty20 in England before they return home for four one-dayers against India and a series in the Caribbean against Bangladesh. And they are then off on their travels again for the Champions Trophy before a tour of Australia. It has been a lot of cricket, Gayle, who turned out for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the ongoing IPL, said. It boils down to the mental side of things, not the physical  and it has been non-stop for us.

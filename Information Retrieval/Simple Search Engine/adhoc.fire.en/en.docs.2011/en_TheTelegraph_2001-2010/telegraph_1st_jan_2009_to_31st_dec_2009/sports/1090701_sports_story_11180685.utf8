The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Serena, Venus inch closer to showdown
                                                   Serena, Venus inch closer to showdown
                      
	London: Venus and Serena Williams are one round away from meeting in another Wimbledon final.         
	Five-time champion Venus overpowered Agnieszka Radwanska 6-1, 6-2 on Tuesday, and two-time winner Serena followed her into the semi-finals with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Victoria Azarenka.         
	No. 3-seeded Venus will next face top-ranked Dinara Safina, who overcame 15 double-faults and beat German teenager Sabine Lisicki 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 6-1 to reach Wimbledons last four for the first time.         
	In the bottom half of the draw, No. 4 Elena Dementieva defeated Italys Francesca Schiavone 6-2, 6-2 to set up a semi-final encounter with No. 2 Serena.         
	Its the first time since 2006 that all four top-seeded women reached the semi-finals at a Grand Slam tournament.         
	The Williams sisters overwhelmed their opponents Tuesday with breathtaking displays of power tennis, showing why they have dominated on the grass of the All England Club for most of the past decade.         
	Venus, seeking her third straight Wimbledon title, outhit the 14th-ranked Pole from all parts of the court and proved again that she is the dominant female player on grass.         
	Do I feel invincible? Venus said. Id like to say yes, but I really do work at it.         
	She had her left leg taped up again but showed no weakness at all as she ripped 29 winners  compared to six for Radwanska  in a match that lasted just 68 minutes on a sunbaked Court 1.         
	I cant complain, Venus said. Im in the semi-finals of Wimbledon, right where I want to be. I just need to take another step forward.         
	With Venus looking on from the guest box, Serena swept through the first set against the eighth-ranked Azarenka in 26 minutes. After being broken to go down 3-2 in the second, she won four straight games and held serve at love to finish the match in commanding fashion. Serena had nine aces and 26 winners, with only seven unforced errors.         
	Only once in the last nine years has there been a Wimbledon womens final that didnt feature at least one of the Williams sisters. The sisters were the only two Grand Slam winners left in the womens field  Serena has 10 major titles and Venus seven.         
	The sisters have met in three Wimbledon finals, including last year, and remain on course for a fourth title meeting. Venus has won two of the three. They are 10-10 in career meetings.         
	I would love it to be a Williams final, and so would she (Serena), Venus said. That would be great.         
	Venus is trying to become the first woman since Steffi Graf in 1991-93 to win three Wimbledon titles in a row.         
	Venus raced to a 5-0 lead against Radwanska, and finished off the first set with back-to-back aces. She dropped only two of 18 points on serve in the set. That first set for me was almost perfect, she said.         
	Radwanska managed to win the first two games of the second set, but Venus regained command and ran off six straight to finish the match, ending with a clean forehand winner.         
	She was serving and hitting the ball so strong, Radwanska said. Her tennis is so powerful. She was playing so good, it was very hard to do anything. If she will play like this, she will (win) one more time this tournament.         
	Safina, who has risen to No. 1 in the world despite never having won a Grand Slam title, struggled against the 19-year-old Lisicki. The Russian had to come from behind after double-faulting to lose the first set tiebreaker, smashing her racket to the turf and drawing a warning from the chair umpire.         
	I was Santa Claus on the court, serving so many double-faults, Safina said.         
	Safina was down 3-2 on serve in the second set, but got the one break in the seventh game to force a third set. The 41st-ranked Lisicki received treatment on her right calf after going down 4-1 in the third. In the next game, Safina was up 40-0 before serving three straight double-faults. She still managed to hold and then broke for the match.         
	I was tough mentally, that was the key, Safina said. Dementieva, meanwhile, grabbed a 5-0 lead in the first set against the 43rd-ranked Schiavone and converted both of her break points in the second to seal the win in 66 minutes.         
	Dementieva also reached the Wimbledon semi-finals last year. She is still looking for her first major title after being runner-up at both the French Open and US Open in 2004.         
	The mens quarterfinals are set for Wednesday with five-time champion Roger Federer against 6-foot-10 Croat Ivo Karlovic, No. 3 Andy Murray versus Spanish wild card Juan Carlos Ferrero, 2002 champion Lleyton Hewitt takes on two-time finalist Andy Roddick and No. 3 Novak Djokovic plays Tommy Haas.         
	Temperatures topped 30 degrees (90 degrees f) on Tuesday, with no need to close the roof on Centre Court.           (AP)

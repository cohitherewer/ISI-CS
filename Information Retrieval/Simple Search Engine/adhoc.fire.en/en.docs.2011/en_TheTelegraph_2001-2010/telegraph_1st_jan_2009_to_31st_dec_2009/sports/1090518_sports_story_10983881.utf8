	Chester-le-Street: England scented victory in the second Test after reducing the West Indies to 115 for three in their second innings at the close of the fourth day on Sunday.         
	The West Indies, who were asked to follow on, trailed by 144 runs with seven wickets remaining and England should wrap up a 2-0 series victory on Monday.         
	Shivnarine Chanderpaul (18) and Lendl Simmons (3) were the not out batsmen, with the obdurate Chanderpaul offering the West Indies a glimmer of hope.         
	The gritty left-hander became his countrys second highest Test run-scorer, passing Viv Richards on 8,540. Only Brian Lara stands above him on the list.         
	Earlier, England pace bowler James Anderson took five wickets and Ramnaresh Sarwan struck a defiant century as the West Indies were bowled out for 310 in their first innings. England, 259 runs ahead, enforced the follow-on and captain Chris Gayle smashed 54 off 43 balls, including two huge sixes, before he and Sarwan fell to Graham Onions in the space of three balls. The West Indies resumed in the morning on 94 for three and Sarwan added 99 for the fourth wicket with Chanderpaul who was out for 23.

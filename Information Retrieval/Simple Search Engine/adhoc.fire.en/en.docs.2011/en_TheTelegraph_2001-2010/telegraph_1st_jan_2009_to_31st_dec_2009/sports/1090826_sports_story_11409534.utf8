The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fans rally around Caster
                                                     Fans rally around Caster
                  World 800m champion Caster Semenya with South Africa President Jacob Zuma at the presidential guest house in Pretoria on Tuesday                     
	Johannesburg: Some 1,000 fans sang and danced at the airport on Tuesday in support of Caster Semenya as the runner, who is undergoing gender testing after her 800m win at the World Championships, returned home to South Africa.         
	Semenya arrived on a flight from Germany with other members of the South African team after competing in Berlin.         
	The 18-year-old, dressed in her team tracksuit with her gold medal around her neck, then was brought to a stage set up in the parking lot.         
	Hi everybody, Semenya told the roaring crowd of fans. Standing in a row with the other South African medallists, she gave a thumbs-up sign and waved to people she recognised in the crowd.         
	Semenya also was welcomed home by her parents, siblings and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela  the former wife of the countrys first black president Nelson Mandela.         
	Semenyas victory came after world athletics officials said they were conducting gender tests after questions arose about her muscular build and deep voice.         
	South Africans have embraced her achievement, despite the questions. A homemade poster held by a fan at the airport declared Semenya our first lady of sport.         
	Semenya is not accused of trying to cheat, but of perhaps unknowingly having a medical condition that blurs her gender and gives her an unfair advantage over other female runners.         
	Fans organised by womens rights groups and political groups, school sports teams, and some who came on their own, ringed the balcony overlooking the arrivals hall. Others danced, sang or blew the plastic horns known as vuvuzelas more commonly seen at soccer matches.         
	The IAAF, track and fields governing body, will decide Semenyas case according to whether her conditions ... accord no advantage over other females after consulting a gynaecologist, an endocrinologist, a psychologist, an internal medicine specialist and a gender expert.         
	Her genes and physiology as well as how she sees herself and how her community sees her could play a role in their determination.         
	South Africans have been outraged not just that questions have been raised, but that they have been made public.         
	On Sunday, Lamine Diack, the IAAF president, said the affair was handled badly.           (AP)

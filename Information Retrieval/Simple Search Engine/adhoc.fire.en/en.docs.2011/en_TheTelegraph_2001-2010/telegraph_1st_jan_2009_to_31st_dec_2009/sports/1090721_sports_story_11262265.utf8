The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jaime to become youngest F1 driver
                                                   Jaime to become youngest F1 driver
                      
	London: Spanish teenager Jaime Alguersuari will become the youngest driver to race in Formula One after Toro Rosso named him on Monday as replacement for sacked Frenchman Sebastien Bourdais.         
	The driver, born on March 23, 1990, will make his debut at Budapests Hungaroring this weekend at the age of 19 years and 125 days.         
	The previous youngest driver was New Zealands Mike Thackwell, who entered the 1980 Canadian GP with Tyrrell aged 19 and 183 days.         
	I do not expect anything from him for at least his first three races, team principal Franz Tost said in a statement.         
	Red Bulls stated aim for Scuderia Toro Rosso is that, when possible, it should be used to provide a seat for products of its Young Driver Programme, he added.           (REUTERS)

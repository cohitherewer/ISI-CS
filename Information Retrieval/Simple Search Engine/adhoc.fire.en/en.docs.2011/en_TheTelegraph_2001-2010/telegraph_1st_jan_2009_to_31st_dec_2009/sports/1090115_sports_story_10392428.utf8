                                                   SLC sold to India for 10 years: Paper
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has entered into a ten-year deal with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), a leading newspaper in Colombo said on Wednesday.         
	Sri Lanka Cricket has been sold to India for a period of 10 years for a grand sum of $45 million, the newspaper said in an article.         
	At a time when various cricket boards in the world and the International Cricket Council are showing concern on the way the cash rich Indian board is trying to manipulate cricket, SLC has become the latest pawn to fall prey to the BCCI, it said.         
	The deal was confirmed at the Sri Lanka Cricket headquarters yesterday (Tuesday) in the presence of N. Srinivasan, the secretary of the BCCI, Gamini Lokuge, the minister of sports and Duleep Mendis, the CEO of SLC, it said.         
	We have finalised a 10-year agreement with India, Lokuge told the media.         
	As per the agreement, the SLC has agreed to release the players for the Indian Premier League and the Champions League for the next 10 years, support the BCCI on the ICL issue and also strengthen relationship with them.         
	While Indias tour to Sri Lanka will bring in millions of television revenue, the agreement to free players to participate in the IPL and participation of a local team in the Champions League starting next year will also give them approximately $45 million during the ten-year period.         
	The deal certainly looks lucrative for people who want to keep Arjuna Ranatunga out of the SLC. Its now known that some in the BCCI wanted to be absolutely sure that the World Cup-winning captain and Member of Parliament wouldnt be allowed to make a comeback as chairman of SLC.         
	Significantly, before he was sacked late last month, Ranatunga lifted the ban on players who had aligned themselves with the ICL.         
	As per the agreement to be signed next month, not only will former players like Maravan Atapattu and Russel Arnold not be able to play in any domestic tournaments because of their ICL links, they will also be deprived of holding any position at the board or be involved with any other matters pertaining to the sport including cricket commentaries.

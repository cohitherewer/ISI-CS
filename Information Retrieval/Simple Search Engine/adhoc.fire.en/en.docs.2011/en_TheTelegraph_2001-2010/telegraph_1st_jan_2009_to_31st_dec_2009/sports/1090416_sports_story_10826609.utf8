The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chelsea cant afford lapses: Hiddink
                                                   Chelsea cant afford lapses: Hiddink
                      
	Hiddinks side reached the last four after surviving one of the most dramatic matches in the history of Europes elite club competition at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday.         
	After winning 3-1 at Anfield in the first leg, Chelsea were expected to cruise through but twice they were within one goal of surrendering that lead as Liverpool made a heroic bid for victory. It wasnt until Frank Lampard scored his second goal in the last minute that the Blues could finally relax.         
	The amazing 4-4 draw sealed a 7-5 aggregate success for Chelsea, but Hiddink knows Barcelona are capable of making Chelsea pay a heavier price if they produce another performance laced with so many errors.         
	Barcelona have skilful players and they know how to handle the pace of the game. They always like to play an advanced, attacking game, Hiddink said.         
	If you give teams who are very skilful too much space, they know how to handle it and go into that space. Then you are in for a very difficult match.         
	It is difficult to play them because they are a top team, but it is one of those beautiful games at the end of the season.         
	Chelseas cause wont be helped by the absence of Ashley Cole after he picked up a booking that triggers a one-match ban.         
	With Paulo Ferreira injured, Hiddink has no experienced cover for the England left-back.         
	Hiddink will also have to spend time working out a way to restore Czech goalkeeper Petr Cechs shattered confidence.         
	After conceding three goals against Bolton on Saturday, Cech looked a nervous wreck and was caught completely out of position by Fabio Aurelios clever first half free-kick.         
	Hiddink admitted Cechs morale is low but refused to consider dropping him for Saturdays FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal.

                                                     Easy wins for Pennetta, Tsonga 
                  Serena Williams after defeating Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez 6-3, 7-5 on Friday.                     
	New York: Flavia Pennetta became the first woman to advance to the fourth round at this years US Open, beating Aleksandra Wozniak of Canada 6-1, 6-1 Friday.         
	The 10th-seeded Italian was in control throughout against Wozniak, finishing with 13 winners to three for the Canadian.         
	Pennetta has lost just six games while sweeping six sets through three rounds at Flushing Meadows. She had her best Grand Slam result in New York last year, losing in the quarterfinals.         
	The second woman to go through was Slovakias Daniela Hantuchova. The Slovak defeated USs Vania King 6-2,6-2.         
	Meanwhile, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga advanced to the third round beating Jarkko Nieminen of Finland 7-5, 6-3, 6-4.         
	The seventh-seeded Frenchman had 45 winners and converted all three of his break-point chances to improve to 38-14 this year.         
	Tsonga has reached the third round at Flushing Meadows in three consecutive years but has yet to advance past this point. The 2008 Australian Open finalist lost to Tommy Robredo last year and Rafael Nadal in his US Open debut in 2007.         
	Julien Benneteau of France got the better of the 30 th seed from Serbia, Viktor Troicki. The Frenchman won in four sets, 6-1, 3-6, 6-1, 6-0.         
	Meanwhile on Thursday, Kazakhstans Yaroslava Shvedova provided a shock, saving two match points to squeeze past 2008 runner-up and fifth seed Jankovic 6-3, 6-7, 7-6.         
	Jankovics mind and heart was not on tennis, however, as she later revealed her grandmother had passed away in Serbia.         
	I was very close to her. I was very sad and emotionally I was really not on court. I really tried my best to be there... but it was really hard, the usually bubbly Jankovic said through a WTA representative.         
	For Melanie Oudin, who got the better of Elena Dementieva (as reported in Fridays City Edition), she will next run into 2006 champion Maria Sharapova who handed another American 17-year-old, Christina McHale, a 6-2, 6-1 masterclass under floodlights.         
	The 381st-ranked McHale was a wild card entry who didnt really challenge Sharapova.         
	Looking ahead to facing Oudin, Sharapova said: I definitely have to go out there and expect her to play some of her best tennis.         
	I mean, Ive got a tough round ahead of me. Also somebody that Ive never played against before, someone thats going to come out and, Im sure, shes going to swing and have nothing to lose  which she doesnt.         
	French Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova avoided all the drama with a 6-4, 6-2 win over Latvian Anastasija Sevastsova, while on the mens side Novak Djokovic kept the Serbian flag flying following the early exits of Jankovic and Ana Ivanovic.         
	The fourth seed beat Australian Carsten Ball 6-3, 6-4, 6-4.         
	Wimbledon runner-up Andy Roddick completed the night session with a clinical 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 win against Frenchman Marc Gicquel.           (AGENCIES)

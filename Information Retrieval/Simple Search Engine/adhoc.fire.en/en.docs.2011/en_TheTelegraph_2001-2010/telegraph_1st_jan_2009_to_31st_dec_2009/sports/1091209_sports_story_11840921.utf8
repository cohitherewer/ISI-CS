The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | New strategy break on the anvil
                                                                                                                       7                                      New strategy break on the anvil
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The third edition of Indian Premier League (IPL) will see a change in the format of the much-debated strategy break, said tournament commissioner Lalit Modi.         
	This time there will be two strategy breaks of two-and-half minutes each per innings. The first two-and-half minute break will be the batting sides discretion.         
	The bowling side will then choose when to implement their two-and-half minute strategy break, Modi told the reporters after his two-hour meeting with CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya at the Eden on Tuesday.         
	During the second edition of the IPL in South Africa, a seven-and-half minute strategy break was introduced halfway through each innings.         
	Speaking on the non-participation of Pakistani players, the BCCI vice-president said: Its unfortunate. But we dont see any reason to consult the home ministry.         
	The Kolkata Knight Riders coach Dav Whatmore feels that there is no point talking about something which is beyond their control. The KKR will be one of the most affected franchise as they will again miss the services of speedster Umar Gul.         
	We have zeroed in on a few players who can be possible replacements but we would not like to disclose their names before the bidding, Whatmore said.         
	The next KKR camp will be from January 8-15 in Calcutta.

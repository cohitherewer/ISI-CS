The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Misbah-ul Haq axed, Pakistan recall Butt
                                                   Misbah-ul Haq axed, Pakistan recall Butt
                      
	Karachi: Senior batsman Misbah-ul Haq was Thursday dropped from the Pakistan teams for the forthcoming one-day series against New Zealand and the subsequent away Test series against them.         
	[As reported in Thursdays The Telegraph, Mohammed Asif (for non-cricketing reasons), Misbah and Imran Nazir have failed to make the ODI squad while Abdul Razzaq, Salman Butt and rookie Khalid Latif have been included.]         
	Misbah does not feature in any of the three Pakistan squads for the four ODIs and two Twenty20 matches in Abu Dhabi and Dubai from November 3 and for the Test tour of New Zealand.         
	Chief selector Iqbal Qasim justified Misbahs axing, saying the player needed rest to refresh himself and come back stronger.         
	Misbah, 35, got the axe for the first time since his 2001 comeback to the national team.         
	Misbahs axing comes at a time when despite all criticism against him and his form, he has still averaged around 39 in ODIs in the last two years.         
	Sources said captain Younis Khan and Qasim were against having Misbah in the side when the selectors met in Lahore to pick the squads.         
	The biggest complaint against Misbah is that he has not behaved like a team man in recent months and was challenging the authority of the captain, one source claimed.         
	The selectors, meanwhile, reposed confidence in opener Imran Farhat.

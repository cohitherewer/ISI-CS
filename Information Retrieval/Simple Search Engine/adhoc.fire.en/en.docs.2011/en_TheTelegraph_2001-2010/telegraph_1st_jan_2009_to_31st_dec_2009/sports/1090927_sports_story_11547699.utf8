                                                   Wigan end Blues run
  - United down Stoke 2-0 to move to the top; Liverpool thrash Hull 6-1                             
	London: Chelseas perfect start to the season ended with a 1-3 loss at Wigan on Saturday, allowing defending champions Manchester United to go top in the Premier League by winning 2-0 at Stoke.         
	Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech was sent off early in the second half for tripping Hugo Rodallega, who proceeded to make it 2-1 from the penalty spot and condemn Carlo Ancelotti to his first loss as Chelsea manager.         
	United moved above Chelsea on goal difference after Ryan Giggs came off the bench to provide goals for Dimitar Berbatov and John Shea.         
	Liverpool and Tottenham are both three points adrift after emphatic victories.         
	Fernando Torres scored a hattrick in Liverpools 6-1 win over Hull, and Robbie Keane hit four goals as Tottenham thrashed Burnley 5-0.         
	Portsmouths worst start continued, losing 0-1 against Everton for their seventh straight league defeat to remain pointless and rooted to the bottom.         
	After eight wins in all competitions, Ancelotti took Chelsea to a Wigan side that had not previously beaten one of the Big Four clubs  also including United, Liverpool and Arsenal  in 34 attempts since arriving in the Premier League.         
	Titus Bramble headed Wigan ahead in the 16th minute, but Chelsea hit back two minutes after the break when Didier Drogba scored his 100th goal for the club. A minute later, the visitors were reduced to 10 men when Cech was shown the first red card of his Chelsea career in his 230th match.         
	Midfielder Florent Malouda made way for back-up goalkeeper Henrique Hilario, who couldnt stop Rodallegas penalty.         
	Having used all their substitutes, Chelsea was reduced to nine men for the closing minutes when defender Ashley Cole was carried off on a stretcher injured. Paul Scharner added a third for Wigan in the stoppage time.         
	Im very happy today (Saturday) because its the first time we beat a top-four team, Scharner said. We try very hard in training to employ (manager) Roberto Martinezs philosophy and each week we get better.         
	The Red Devils, whose only loss this season was to Burnley in their second match, took until the 62nd minute to break through at Stoke.         
	Giggs provided Berbatov with a tap-in, and the 35-year-old midfielder  English footballs most decorated player  curled a free-kick that Shea headed into the far corner 15 minutes later.         
	Liverpools draw against Hull last season was one of seven at Anfield that cost Rafa Benitezs side the league title. It looked like history would repeat itself when Torres put the Reds ahead in the 12th only for Geovanni to level inside three minutes.         
	But there was no way back for the visitors after Torres found the net again in the 28th. The Spain striker completed his hattrick two minutes into the second half before being replaced by Ryan Babel in the 67th. If he hadnt come off  we want to protect him  he could have scored more goals, manager Rafa Benitez said. We were attacking and attacking and attacking, and it was just a question of time before we scored all those goals.

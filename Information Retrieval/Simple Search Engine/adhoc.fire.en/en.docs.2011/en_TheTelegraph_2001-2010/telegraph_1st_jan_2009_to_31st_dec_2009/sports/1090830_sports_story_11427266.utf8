The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Syria pip India in close tie
                                                     Syria pip India in close tie
            JAYDEEP BASU            Rennedy Singh                           
	New Delhi: What was expected to be a mere dress rehearsal for the final to be played on Monday, turned out to be a fierce encounter as Syria overcame a depleted India 1-0 to finish the round robin with an all-win record in the ONGC-Nehru Cup on Saturday.         
	Though the result of the match made no impact on the tournament, a near capacity crowd at the Ambedkar Stadium went full throttle to egg on their favourite team.         
	The crowd frenzy rose in the second session when the Indians attacked relentlessly after conceding the only goal of the match in the first half. Every time an Indian touched the ball in the rival area, he was backed by the crowd.         
	The Indians, minus their top players, lost but did not disappoint. The substitutes, some of whom had their first chance to have a fill of the pitch in this Nehru Cup, matched their rivals with constant runs and determined efforts.         
	The skipper for the day, Rennedy Singh was a constant source of trouble for the Syrian defence on the left with his probing runs. On the right, Syed Rahim Nabi, in his first appearance in the tournament, played his heart out.         
	The Indians were an attacking lot but couldnt create too many openings. The only time the Syrian goal was in real danger was in the first half when Rennedys booming shot missed the target by a whisker and went over the bar. Mehrajuddin, too, shot out from close once.         
	Though India had the edge in the first half, a rather vulnerable defence let them down at the rear. The crowd that was rooting for the Indians from the beginning was hugely disappointed when Syria went ahead through Ali Dyab in the 19th minute of the match.         
	India conceded a free-kick on the left edge of the box when experienced Deepak Mondal brought down Moutaz Kaildni, the Syrian midfielder. Kaildni himself took the free-kick and an unmarked Dyab headed past a diving goalkeeper Subrata Paul. India coach, Bob Houghton, however, didnt look too happy with the referees decision and was seen saying something to one of the assistant referees. He even walked up to the Maldives referee, Adil Ali, at the half-time to say a few things.         
	All of you watched the incident. Was that free kick necessary, Houghton asked during the post-match media conference. He, however, admitted that the Indian defence has problems with set piece moves.         
	The Indian goal had another narrow escape when Gourmangi Singh made a faulty clearance inside the box and the ball was intercepted by Raja Rafe, who shot at the goal. Paul came up with a spectacular save to avert danger.         
	In 2007 Nehru Cup, India had lost in the group league against Syria 2-3 but went on to win a cliff hanger in the final by a solitary goal.

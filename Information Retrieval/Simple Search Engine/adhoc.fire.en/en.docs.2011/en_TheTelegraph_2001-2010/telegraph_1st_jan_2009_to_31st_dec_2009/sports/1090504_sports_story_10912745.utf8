	 Clarke not to play T20 vs Pak
    Calcutta: Michael Clarke, the acting Australian captain, will not play in Thursdays Twenty20 game against Pakistan in Dubai and will return to Australia on Monday, Cricket Australias national selection panel (NSP) announced on Sunday. NSP chairman Andrew Hilditch said Clarkes return would give him extra time to prepare for the upcoming ICC World Twenty20 and Ashes series. Brad Haddin will take over the captaincy.               
	 U-19 cricket
    Calcutta: The Hong Kong under-19 team won the ACC U-19 Elite Cup 2009 in Kuwait as they beat the Afghanistan under-19 side by eight wickets. Afghanistan batted first and made a competitive 215 for nine in 50 overs with Asgher Hotak top scoring with 70. In reply, a fine 94 from Man of the Match James Atkinson ensured that Hong Kong claimed the title with three overs to spare.               
	 ICC advice
  New Delhi: International Cricket Council principal adviser I.S. Bindra has urged the United States Cricket Association to develop a Twenty20 tournament on the lines of the Indian Premier League (IPL) to counter the American Premier League. I feel that regulation is not the only way to curb unapproved ventures. You need to have a successful alternative, too, like how the Board of Council for Cricket in India (BCCI) developed its Premier League as a viable model (to the ICL), Bindra said.               
	 Booze bounty
  Johannesburg: The Indian Premier League (IPL) organisers have ended up infuriating administrators and alcohol suppliers here by asking for a pouring charge on the sale of liquor at the Wanderers. The IPL has asked for $40,000 from the company contracted to supply liquor at the Wanderers. Many local administrators reportedly stayed away from the Delhi DareDevils versus Chennai Super Kings match in protest.

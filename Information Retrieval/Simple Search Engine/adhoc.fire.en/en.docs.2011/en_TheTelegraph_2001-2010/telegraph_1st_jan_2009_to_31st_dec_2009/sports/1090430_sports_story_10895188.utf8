                                                     Set-up needs to improve: Bhaichung
            A STAFF REPORTER            Bhaichung Bhutia at a city function on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: India captain Bhaichung Bhutia feels that the infrastructure of Indian football has actually gone backwards in the last decade despite several attempts by the All-India football Federation (AIFF) to improve it.         
	The standard of the game has gone up. The quality has improved with the coming of I-League. The competition is stiff now but the worst part is that infrastructure has not changed, Bhaichung said. The India captain was speaking at a promotional event where he was presented with a customised concept car, designed especially for him.         
	The ground conditions have not changed. If you look at the first National League and the present one, the infrastructure has actually gone backwards. We really need to work on that, the ace striker said.               
	Mohun Bagan won the Premier Division and lifted both the Federation Cup and the Super Cup but finished second in the I-League.         
	Asked how long will he continue playing, Bhaichung said it was difficult to tell but added that as long as he was enjoying the game and remained injury free he would continue playing.         
	Its very difficult to predict. But as long as I keep enjoying football I will play. It may be five years, 10 years, one year or six months, he signed off.

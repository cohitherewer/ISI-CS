The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC rejects Pak legal claims on 2011 Cup
                                                   BRIEFS
                      
	 ICC rejects Pak legal claims on 2011 Cup
    Calcutta: The ICC Thursday rejected Pakistans claims that the stripping of 2011 World Cup matches from that country due to security concerns was legally flawed.         
	It asked the PCB to withdraw the spurious claims and engage with the governing body of the game instead of knocking the doors of the Court of Arbitration for Sports.         
	Responding to the claims made by the PCB in the legal notice, the ICC said its board had not decided to remove them as a joint host of the event, but only that the matches assigned to the PCB should be played outside Pakistan. We are naturally disappointed that the PCB has chosen to pursue its grievance with the ICC through legal channels, but having received correspondence from its lawyers, we have now responded, chief executive Haroon Lorgat said.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                       
	Guwahati: Mahindra United began their Federation Cup campaign with a 2-1 win over Chirag United Monday at the Nehru Stadium.         
	Mahindras goals came through Sushil Kumar Singh and N.P. Pradeep while Edmilson Marques pulled one back from the spot for the Calcutta club.         
	The match was marked by reckless tackles and, towards the end, frayed nerves. One such tackle resulting, towards the fag end, in a red card for Chirags R. Dhanaranjan for a second bookable offence, reducing his team to ten men for the last few minutes. He had been earlier cautioned for dissent.         
	Mahindra were the better of the two sides with Chirag impressive only in patches. The Calcutta outfit did raise their game after Edmilson reduced the deficit from the spot in the 79th minute after Justin Stephen had fouled the Brazilian forward.         
	Steven Diass well-measured free-kick, in the first minute of first-half time added on, was met by Sushil and Mahindra had taken a 1-0 lead.         
	A Muritala Ali-Sushil Kumar one-two, in the 63rd minute, set up the second goal with Pradeeps powerful kick beating Chirag custodian Somath Khara all ends up.         
	Having played for Guwahati outfit Assam State Electricity Board Sports Club four years back, Kumar was happy with his contribution, praising team effort for the win.         
	 Chirag coach Subrata Bhattacharjee was unhappy with the refereeing and the misses by his forwards. On Tuesday, Dempo SC take on Pune FC in the first match while Air India play Shillong Lajong FC in the second tie at the same venue.

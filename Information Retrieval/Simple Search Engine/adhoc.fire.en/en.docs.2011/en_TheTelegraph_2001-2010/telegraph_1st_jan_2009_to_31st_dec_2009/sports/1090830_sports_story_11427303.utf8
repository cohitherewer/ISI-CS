The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India shot down Test plan: WICB
                                                   India shot down Test plan: WICB
                      
	Port of Spain: The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) chief Julian Hunte has accused the Indian Board of rejecting the International Cricket Council (ICC)s proposal of organising Test cricket with a four-year championship structure.         
	Hunte made the statement in his report at the annual general meeting of the WICB this month.         
	Initially, the ICC attempted to change the structure of the FTP beginning 2012, in which international cricket would have more content and would play more as a Super League with a four-year structure resulting in a World Cricket Championship, but this failed when the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) rejected that proposal, Hunte told a cricket website.         
	This meant a return to the old practice of full members agreeing to a schedule of tours, which in effect places the power in the hands of the four biggest commercially valued members, he said.         
	Hunte, however, did not name the four member Boards but it is an open secret that India, England, Australia and South Africa have a greater say in the ICC board. (PTI)

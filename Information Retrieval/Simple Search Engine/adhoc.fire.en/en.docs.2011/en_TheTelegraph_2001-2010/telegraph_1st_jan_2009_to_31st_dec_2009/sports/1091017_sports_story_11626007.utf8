The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis Khan skips review meeting
                                                     Younis Khan skips review meeting
                  Younis Khan                     
	Lahore: Younis Khan, who has resigned from captaincy, Friday skipped a review session on Pakistans Champions Trophy performance which was held under the supervision of PCB chairman Ejaz Butt at the Gaddafi.         
	The meeting was attended by vice-captain Shahid Afridi, coach Intikhab Alam, manager Yawar Saeed, assistant manager Shafqat Rana, chief selector Iqbal Qasim, and chief operating officer of the PCB, Wasim Bari.         
	Captain Younis Khan did not attend as he had held a detailed discussion a day earlier with the chairman and had advised about his absence from this meeting, a PCB statement said.         
	The statement said that after discussions, participants agreed that Pakistans performance at the Champions Trophy was more than satisfactory.         
	This was followed by a discussion on Pakistans upcoming series against New Zealand. The PCB chairman outlined various strategies leading up to the Twenty20 World Cup in 2010 and the World Cup 2011, the statement said.         
	Such meetings will now be a regular feature as these discussions give insight on various matters and solutions for benefit of cricket, Butt said. Meanwhile, former Pakistan fast bowler Sarfraz Nawaz has said Youniss sudden resignation from the captaincy was a smoke screen to disguise his shortcomings in the one-day game.         
	Just like Twenty20, its high time he should forget playing one-day cricket too, Sarfraz said.         
	Its better if he plays only as a player in Test matches.         
	Younis retired from Twenty20 cricket after leading Pakistan to victory in the World Cup in England this year.           (AGENCIES)

                                                   Hughes is left red-faced
                      
	Birmingham: Australian opening batsman Phillip Hughes was left red-faced after his manager leaked news of the axing from the team for the third Ashes Test starting on Thursday.         
	Hughes was quoted on his Twitter feed overnight saying that he had been dropped from the side to face England and his manager Neil DCosta admitted responsibility for the error.         
	I look after Twitter for him, unfortunately Im the fool on that situation, DCosta said.         
	As a young player he will be reminded that he should not be revealing details until the team has been officially announced, Cricket Australia spokesman Philip Pope said.         
	Former Australia batsman Dean Jones said Hughes had made a serious mistake. (Reuters)

                                                     Chirag, Subrata bury hatchet
            A STAFF REPORTER            Subrata Bhattacharya                           
	Calcutta: After a day-long drama, Chirag United officials and Subrata Bhattacharya decided to bury their differences and work for the cause of the team.         
	At a meeting late on Sunday night between club chairman Kaustav Roy, senior officials and Bhattacharya, the warring factions agreed to move on unitedly. At least for the time being. Chirag, who recorded back to back wins in the I-League, meet Air India on Tuesday.         
	Earlier, a tussle between Bhattacharya and Roy had gone out of control and had a compromise formula, late on Sunday, not been worked out, it would have meant the end of the road for Bhattacharya as the Chirag coach.         
	At the meeting it was decided that Bhattacharya would attend Monday mornings practice session at the Salt Lake Stadium and likewise Roy would give him a proper contract as Chirag coach.         
	It all started after Bhattacharya, obviously euphoric over his teams fantastic start in the I-League, started foul-mouthing East Bengal and Mohun Bagan officials, blaming them for the decline of Calcutta football.         
	Roy and other officials did not like the way Bhattacharya was settling personal scores from the Chirag platform and requested him to avoid making such comments. The former Bagan and East Bengal coach, known for his startling comments, took it personally and refused to attend practice unless he was offered a proper contract.         
	At a press conference on Sunday evening Roy had claimed to have given Bhattacharya a 48-hour deadline to return to practice failing which he would be given the boot.         
	Roy went all out in attacking the coach and said: He was brought in as coach in good faith and he took two months salary without the contract. Why is he asking for a contract now.         
	Bhattacharya, not known for taking things lying down, was equally adamant. Nothing doing. I wont go unless and until I get a proper contract.         
	Chirag, in fact, were already thinking of life without Bhattacharya.         
	They were in talks with Alok Mukherjee and Biswajit Bhattacharya and approached Debasish Mukherjee and Tarun Bose as goalkeeper coach. Now what happens to the idea of hiring a goalkeeper coach remains to be seen.         
	With the stand-off coming to an end, physical trainer Djair Miranda Garcia and assistant coach Anjan Nath will remain to work at the backstage.

	Calcutta: The East Bengal vs Mohun Bagan derby will take place on December 12 in the Sahara Calcutta Football League (CFL), which kicks off Friday. BNR will play Kalighat Milan Samity in the opener at the Mohun Bagan ground.         
	The total number of teams actually participating will be 16 since the Indian Air Force (IAF) have informed about their inability to play the league.         
	According to IFA secretary Utpal Ganguli, IAF will be automatically relegated this season. One other team will also be relegated as per norms, he said.         
	Ganguli further informed: We will not follow the AIFF directive on not playing those players in the local league who have played more than 45 minutes in the I-League as it is not possible here.

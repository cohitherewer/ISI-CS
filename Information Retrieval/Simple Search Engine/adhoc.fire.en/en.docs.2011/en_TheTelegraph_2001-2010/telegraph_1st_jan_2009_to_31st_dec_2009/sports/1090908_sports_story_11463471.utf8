            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India finished their World Archery Championship campaign without a medal after China handed the mens recurve team a 221-216 defeat in the quarter finals at Ulsan (South Korea) Monday.         
	The third-ranked Indian trio of Rahul Banerjee, Mangal Singh Champia and Jayanta Talukdar won the pre-quarter finals against 11th ranked Malaysia. But sixth seed China proved more difficult.

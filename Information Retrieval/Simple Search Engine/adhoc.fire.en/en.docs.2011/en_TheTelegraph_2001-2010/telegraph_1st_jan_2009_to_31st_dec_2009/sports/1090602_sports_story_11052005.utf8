The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Serena storms into quarters
                                                   Serena storms into quarters
                            
	Paris: Serena Williams dispensed with any drama and won easily Monday to reach the quarter finals of the French Open.         
	The No. 2-seeded Williams extended her Grand Slam winning streak to 18 matches by beating Aleksandra Wozniak 6-1, 6-2 in the fourth round.         
	It was a straightforward, 53-minute victory, in contrast to Williams previous match, when she accused her opponent of cheating and had a coughing fit during a changeover.         
	I feel like it was my most focused match so far, said Williams, who has been battling a cold but said shes feeling better.         
	Shes seeking her 11th major title and third in a row. She won last years US Open and the Australian Open in January.         
	Her next opponent will be No. 7-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova.         
	I feel like I have nothing to lose, Williams said. This is when everything counts, you know. I have to pick up my level and play again a really good, strong match, especially playing somebody like Svetlana, who is a great clay-court player and who moves extremely well and doesnt do anything bad.         
	Kuznetsova, winner of the 2004 US Open, advanced by beating No. 12 Agnieszka Radwanska 6-4, 1-6, 6-1. The Russian hit 32 winners to 13 for Radwanska.         
	Williams owns a 5-1 career record against Kuznetsova, including a victory in the Australian Open quarterfinals in January.         
	I really enjoy playing her. Its always fun, Kuznetsova said. She has great personality. ... We have similar interests. We laugh a lot, you know.         
	The tournaments final week began in perfect weather  mild and sunny  and Serena was close to flawless, too. She committed only eight unforced errors and totaled 25 winners to nine for Wozniak.         
	The rout was nothing like her three-set match in the third round, when Williams accused opponent Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez of cheating, saying the Spaniard failed to admit that a shot had bounced off her arm on a critical point.         
	She played really clean, said Wozniak, who never before had reached the fourth round at a major tournament. Wozniak acknowledged being affected by nerves when she stepped out on the main stadium court at Roland Garros, flooded with memories of watching on TV as Monica Seles played. I was really tight. I was really  I was like a rock, Wozniak said. I couldnt let go on my shots and play my game.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania enters doubles last 8 
                                                     Sania enters doubles last 8 
                  Sania Mirza                     
	Hobart: Sania Mirza, playing her first competitive match since a long injury lay-off, and her Italian partner Francesca Schiavone reached the doubles quarter finals of the $220,000 WTA Hobart International tournament on Monday.         
	The fourth seeded Indo-Italian pair defeated Latvian Liga Dekmeijre and Turkeys Ipek Senoglu 7-6 (4), 6-4 in the first round of the hard court event. It took Sania and Schiavone one hour and 24 minutes to carve out the hard-fought win.         
	Sania-Francesca converted two of the seven break-points in the first set while saving four. In the second set, they broke their rivals thrice while dropping their serve twice.         
	Shikha Uberoi and Germanys Jasmin Woehr lost their first round match 6-7 (4), 7-5, 6-10 to the Russian-American pair of Natalie Grandin and Abigail Spears.         
	In singles action, Polish teenager Urszula Radwanska claimed her second big scalp in as many days when she knocked Canadian sixth seed Aleksandra Wozniak.         
	The 18-year-old came from behind to win 3-6, 7-6, 7-5 against a player ranked 94 places ahead of her.         
	The win came 24 hours after she booked her place in the main draw by beating Italys Francesca Schiavone who should have been seeded fourth for the tournament but was thrust into the qualifiers because of an administrative glitch with her entry.         
	Radwanskas chances of progressing further into the competition have been helped by a series of surprise results that have left just three of the eight seeds still going after the first round. Two seeds lost on Sunday and another three, including Wozniak, joined them at the exit on Monday.

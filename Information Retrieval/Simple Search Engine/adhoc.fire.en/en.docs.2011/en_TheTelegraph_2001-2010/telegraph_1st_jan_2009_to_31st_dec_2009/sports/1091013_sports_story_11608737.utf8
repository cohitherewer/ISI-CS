The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bolivia end Brazil winning streak
                                                   Bolivia end Brazil winning streak
                                  
	La Paz: Bolivia ended Brazils run of 11 consecutive wins and 19 matches without defeat when they beat Dungas team 2-1 in a World Cup qualifier on Sunday.         
	There were no final berths at stake since Brazil, who have qualified for South Africa 2010, remained top of the South American group on goal difference from Paraguay. Bolivia were already eliminated.         
	Bolivia went ahead after 10 minutes when midfielder Edgar Olivares headed home unchallenged at a corner.         
	They doubled their lead on the half-hour with a fine free kick by striker Marcelo Martins, who curled the ball over a wall of tall Brazilian defenders and past the static Julio Cesar.         
	Daniel Alves almost pulled one back with a drive from outside the box in the 36th minute that came back off the post. Striker Adriano went for the rebound but scuffed his shot wide.         
	The Brazilians pulled one back 21 minutes from time with a typical Dunga style counter-attack that had right back Maicon at its heart.         
	He robbed the ball in the Brazil box, passed out right to Ramires and charged into Bolivian territory where he picked up the midfielders ball forward and crossed from the right wing for Nilmar to head in.         
	In Africa, Algeria moved to within one point of qualification with a 3-1 comeback win over Rwanda on Sunday and Tunisias 1-0 victory over Kenya kept them two points clear of Nigeria with one match to play.         
	Nader Belhadj scored Algerias vital second goal as the north Africans had to come from behind against last-placed Rwanda in Blida and a draw against Egypt in Cairo next month would seal their place in South Africa.         
	Abdelkader Ghezzal had earlier netted the equaliser and a late penalty from Karim Ziani ensured Algeria stayed three points clear of the African champions in Group C.         
	Tunisia were seconds away from securing qualification from Group B thanks to Issam Jomaas first-minute strike against Kenya before Obinna Nsofor scored three minutes into stoppage time to snatch a 1-0 home win for Nigeria against Mozambique in Abuja.         
	Tunisia maintained their two-point advantage and can secure qualification in Mozambique next month.

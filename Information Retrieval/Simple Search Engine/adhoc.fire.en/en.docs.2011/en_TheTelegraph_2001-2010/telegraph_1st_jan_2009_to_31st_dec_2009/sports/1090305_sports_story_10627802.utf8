                                                   Black Caps scrap   Pak tour
                            
	Napier: A day after the terror attack on the Sri Lankan team in Lahore, New Zealand on Wednesday cancelled their tour of Pakistan, scheduled to be played in November.         
	Were not going and I think thats pretty clear. I dont think any international team will be going to Pakistan in the foreseeable future, New Zealand Cricket chief executive Justine Vaughan said. Now weve seen that cricket can be a target and I think it creates a whole new set of issues and raises the security issue to a whole new level, Vaughan said. Vaughan, however, did not rule out the option of playing the series at a neutral venue.         
	The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ejaz Butt, meanwhile, admitted that Pakistan may lose their World Cup co-hosting rights, adds a report from Karachi. If the situation improves over the next six months or one year then I am hopeful we can also have the 2011 World Cup matches in Pakistan, Butt said.

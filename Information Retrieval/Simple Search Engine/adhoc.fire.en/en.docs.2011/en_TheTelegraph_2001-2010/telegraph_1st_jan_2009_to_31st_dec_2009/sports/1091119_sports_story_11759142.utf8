	Mumbai/ Amritsar: Off-spinner Sarandeep Singh was called for suspect action as Himachal Pradesh struggled to keep Mumbai at bay at the MCA ground here on Wednesday.

	Bhavin Thakkar was the top scorer with 88 while Sarandeep Singh (25) and Anurag Thakur (26) contributed 43 vital runs for Himachals ninth wicket.         
	Sarandeep was no-balled in his third over, and 24th in Mumbais second innings, after which he was taken off the attack.         
	In Amritsar, opener Murali Vijay blasted a classy 148 to help Tamil Nadu take a 112-run first innings lead with four wickets in hand over a hapless Punjab on the second day.         
	Meanwhile, Saurashtra batsman Cheteshwar Pujara scored a double century (204 ..) against Maharashtra in Rajkot. Sitanshu Kotak and Ravindra Jadeja also scored centuries as the hosts declared for 544 for three. In reply, Maharashtra were 53 for one at stumps.

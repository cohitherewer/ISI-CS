                                                   Im not going to be driven by ego or a certain style, says Brendon
    - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 
	   -The Knight Riders captain on his new role and more             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                            
	Cape Town: Brendon McCullum, who has been placed in the Kolkata Knight Riders hot seat, spoke to The Telegraph for around half-an-hour in the lead-up to the franchises opening match in the IPLs second edition.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q Whats your take on captaincy?         
	A I believe youve got to lead by example and put the results on the board... My first job is to score and take catches... Effect stumpings too... If I do that, then the leadership side would become easier.         
	You seem to be a highly positive type...         
	I am... Always look at things on the positive side... I tend to be aggressive and, as the captain, would like to take a line in situations where others could react differently... Ill be giving this job my best shot and know that Im leading a bunch of guys desperate to win the tournament... If we dont, well, well be content with having given it our all.         
	Have you had a role model captain?         
	Yeah... Stephen Fleming, under whom Ive played for New Zealand... Also, somebody I havent played under  Shane Warne...         
	What made Fleming so special?         
	He was an amazing captain, who got the best out of a bunch of players who probably didnt have the skills of some of the others in other teams... He got the players to drive towards a common goal, regardless of ability... Indeed, Fleming built a nice team culture... As captain, he would innovate too, seeking to get the best results.         
	Warne...         
	Hes got a positive style... Is inspirational and, like Fleming, innovative... Warne, clearly, has the ability to impact on any game... Hes not chained by situations. Also, he possesses such charisma.         
	The Knight Riders dressing room has one current international captain (West Indies Chris Gayle) and one former captain (Sourav Ganguly, Indias most successful in Tests). How will you be dealing with them?         
	(Grins) Im lucky... Very lucky to have those guys... Souravs been amazing... Positive and great with the younger lot in our team... I expect him to reach incredible heights in this edition... Hes no more the captain, but still very much a strong leader within the team... Gayle too is a strong leader and has such a presence... Hes also been positive and helpful... Their presence is making my job easier.         
	What did Shah Rukh Khan tell you?         
	Told me to be myself and to be confident... Also, that I should give him a yell if I needed anything... Shah Rukhs treating the team as family and has built a great team culture... We, players, have total freedom to go out and express ourselves.         
	Wont you be under more pressure, given youve succeeded Sourav, such a high-profile cricketer?         
	As Ive told you, Im under no illusions at all. Having said that, Im lucky that the person Ive succeeded is in the team and I can seek his advice. I know Souravs hungry to succeed  thats good for me and the team. Believe me, I could think of lot worse situations.         
	Did you follow Souravs career as the India captain?         
	I did... I loved watching him and he was an inspirational leader who did amazing things with his team, particularly in Test cricket.         
	Could you now get impatient to lead New Zealand?         
	Id certainly love to captain New Zealand at some point in my career, but Im happy being Daniel Vettoris deputy... You could even call me his butler or PA! I do whatever Daniel requires to be done, including making bookings at the golf course... He has an intelligent cricketing brain and is such a fantastic cricketer.         
	John Buchanan has developed the multiple leaders concept. Are you comfortable with it, or things could get complicated?         
	Im comfortable with the way it worked during our camp in Bloemfontein... So much goes on in a T20 game and at such a pace that you do need ideas out in the middle... Eventually, it will come back to one decision-maker (the captain)... Because of the pace, if only one person is to think of ideas, then some beats could be missed. Bottomline is that it worked well in our warm-up games.         
	Whats the No.1 challenge for you?         
	Trying to bring together the different cultures... The different backgrounds of the players... Getting everybody to work towards a common goal and, if everybody reads the same page, then the goal will be easily achieved. I can confidently say we believe we can win IPL 2009.         
	Some fear that, having become the captain, you may temper your approach to batting...         
	(Grins) Look, my game will be determined by what the team needs at that moment... If the team needs me to play sensibly, Ill do that... If the team needs me to hit a six off every ball, Ill try... Im not going to be driven by ego or a certain style, that you can be assured of.         
	Have you had a role model keeper-batsman?         
	Adam Gilchrist... At home, I also grew up watching Adam Parore... The respect I have for Gilchrist is enormous... He has, single-handedly, raised the profile of wicket-keepers around the world... Gilchrist has been special and I admit Ive tried to model parts of my approach on him. The freedom he brings to his game is something Ive tried to take out of him.         
	Would your explosive 158 not out (73 balls) in the inaugural match last year, in Bangalore, be a defining moment in your career?         
	T20 is suited to my game... Know how to operate... That innings opened some doors and also opened my eyes... That I could achieve big on a platform featuring the worlds biggest. Made me realise that, at the top of my game, I could compete with the very best... Definitely gave me the confidence to push on.         
	The form you enjoy the most...         
	All three... Tests, ODIs and T20... A healthy diet of all three. Test cricket is, of course, hard and remains the ultimate test. Thats why the purists love it... I guess were lucky that weve got three products within one sport.         
	Besides being positive, how would you describe yourself?         
	Pretty relaxed, but competitive... Ive got the ability to sink my teeth into a role, if need be...         
	What are your interests besides the professional one?         
	Golf, though my handicap isnt as good as it should be  I play off 10... I like spending time with family and friends and its pleasing that my wife is here.         
	Your favourite golfer?         
	(Grins) The one and only Tiger Woods... Hes just amazing and has such a terrific attitude.         
	Outside cricket, who has had the biggest influence?         
	A lot of people, especially those whove helped in difficult times... It would be disrespectful if I named only one.         
	Finally, is there a message for the Knight Riders fans?         
	Sure... That the team is working hard to try and win the tournament... Weve got a good team environment and do keep supporting us... Weve got a strong team culture as well, which will allow us to bounce back if we have setbacks.

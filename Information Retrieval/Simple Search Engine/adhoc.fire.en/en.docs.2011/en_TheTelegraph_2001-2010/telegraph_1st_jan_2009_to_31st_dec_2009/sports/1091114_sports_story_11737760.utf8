The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods in 3-shot lead
                                                                                                                                     Woods in 3-shot lead
                  Tiger Woods                     
	Melbourne: Tiger Woods battled swirling breezes and some wayward driving to card a patient four-under-par 68 and take a three-stroke lead after the second round of the A$1.5 million ($1.4 million) Australian Masters on Friday.         
	Woods, co-leader overnight, made two of his four birdies in his first two holes to take the outright lead, then held firm with six successive pars to finish with a 10-under total of 134 in bright sunshine at Kingston Heath Golf Club.         
	Today I didnt really do anything great but I made two big par putts at nine and 14 to keep the round going, the world No. 1 told reporters.         
	To shoot 68 today, I thought it was a pretty good number considering the conditions ... To not drop a shot today was hard. Those are always days that you feel quite good about.         
	The Americans patience was in marked contrast to his nearest challengers, who threatened at times but crumbled with bogeys late on as the wind picked up in the afternoon.         
	Australian James Nitties, who shared a one-stroke lead with Woods and South Africas Branden Grace overnight, was first to mount a challenge, clawing within a stroke with his third birdie on the par-five 14th.         
	He fell back, however, with two late bogeys to finish the day in second place on 137 with compatriot Greg Chalmers and American Jason Dufner, who stormed into contention with a seven-birdie 67.         
	Chalmers look capable of reeling in Woods, notching four birdies to soar to eight under, but stumbled with a bogey on the par-four 17th.         
	Australias Adam Scott (142) failed to convert birdie chances and was eight shots behind Woods at the halfway mark, while former US Open champion Geoff Ogilvy battled to hit greens in regulation and is a further three back (145).         
	Stuart Appleby, coming off an indifferent season on the US PGA Tour, is five behind Woods after posting a two-under 70.         
	Michael Campbell of New Zealand and Scotsman Andrew Coltart were among those who will miss the weekends action after the cut was set at three-over-par 147. (Reuters)

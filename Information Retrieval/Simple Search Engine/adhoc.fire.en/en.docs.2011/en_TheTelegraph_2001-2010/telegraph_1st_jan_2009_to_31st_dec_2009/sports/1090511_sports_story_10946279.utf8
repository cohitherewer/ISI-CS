The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev slips, Woods up to joint 2nd
                                                   Jeev slips, Woods up to joint 2nd
                      
	Ponte Vedra Beach (US): Jeev Milkha Singh continued to find the going tough at The Players Championship, carding a disappointing four-over 76 in the penultimate round to slip to the tied 65th spot.         
	The Indian has a three-day total of two-over 218 in the $9.5m event being played at TPC Sawgrass here.         
	Off to the worst possible start, Jeev stumbled to a bogey quartet before picking up a birdie on the eighth hole to make the turn three-over. The back-nine was no better as Jeev dropped four more strokes. However, a birdie on the 11th and an eagle on the 16th hole prevented the Indian from dropping too low on the leader-board. Swede Daniel Chopra posted a 72 to move up from his second round tied-22nd place to tied-11th with a total of four-under 212.         
	Germanys Alex Cejka held a five-shot lead at the end of the third round of the Players Championship on Saturday but Tiger Woods moved ominously into joint second spot.         
	Woods, who shot a two-under 70 to move into a group of six players tied second on six-under, said he was back in the ball-game despite another topsy-turvy round. World No. 2 Phil Mickelson, who has had a disappointing week, shot 71 to leave himself tied in 41st place.

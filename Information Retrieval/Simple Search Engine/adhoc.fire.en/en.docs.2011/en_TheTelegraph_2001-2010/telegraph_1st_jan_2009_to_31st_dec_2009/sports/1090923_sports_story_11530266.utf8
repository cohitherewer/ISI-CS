	Barcelona: Cameroon striker Samuel Eto is demanding about euro 3 million ($4.4 million) from former club Barcelona as part of the deal under he which was transferred to Inter Milan.         
	Lawyers for the club and player are to meet in court in the coming weeks to try and reach a settlement but club officials said Tuesday that an agreement was unlikely.         
	The 28-year-old Eto filed the claim against the European champions demanding payment of 15 per cent of his transfer deal, or about euro 3 million, Barcelona said.         
	Barcelona argued the transfer stipulation applied only to deals between Spanish clubs. In any case, Barcelona said it would be the club buying the player that should be making the payment.         
	But the Catalan club argued that this transfer stipulation applies only to deals between Spanish clubs.         
	Eto scored 30 goals for Barcelona last season, including the opener in the Champions League final win over Manchester United.         
	Etos next visit to Nou Camp would be for the return leg of the Champions League group F match vs Barcelona on November 24. (AP)

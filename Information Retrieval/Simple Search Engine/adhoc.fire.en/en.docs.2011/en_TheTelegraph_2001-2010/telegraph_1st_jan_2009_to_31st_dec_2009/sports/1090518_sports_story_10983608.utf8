The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Roger rattles Rafa
                                                     Roger rattles Rafa
                  Roger Federer after the victory on Sunday                     
	Madrid: Roger Federer beat top-ranked Rafael Nadal in a final for the first time in two years on Sunday to claim the Madrid Open title 6-4, 6-4.         
	Second-ranked Federer broke a sluggish Nadal once in both sets before firing his sixth ace of the match to claim his 15th Masters Series title on the second match point. Federer also won here in 2006 when the event was played on indoor hard court.         
	It was only Federers second victory over his top rival on clay with the other coming at the Hamburg final two years ago. The victory also ended Federers five-match losing streak to Nadal, a streak in which he lost at Roland Garros, Wimbledon and Australia.         
	He was simply better than me, Nadal said.         
	Federers first title of the season ended Nadals 33-match clay winning streak going into the French Open, where the Spaniard is going for a fifth straight title.         
	Earlier, Dinara Safina of Russia beat Danish teenager Caroline Wozniacki 6-2, 6-4 to win the womens title.         
	Federer and Nadal joked after receiving their trophies, a contrasting scene to January when Federer was in tears after his Australian Open final defeat to Nadal.         
	Only Ivan Lendl and John McEnroe have met in more finals  20  as the pair played for a 16th time with Nadal still holding a comfortable lead at 11-5. Nadal leads the overall series 13-7 as the pair played in front of Nadals biggest supporters for the first time.         
	Federer, who is also the only top-10 player to have ever beaten Nadal on clay, saved two Nadal break chances before converting his first try in the ninth game.         
	Federer slapped a forehand winner down the near line to set up the point and converted when Nadal weakly backhanded into net.         
	Federer served out to love to take the opening set. Nadals gruelling semi-final win against Novak Djokovic took its toll as he failed to reach a lot of the balls he normally does. It doesnt help to play four hours on Saturday, said Nadal, who also pointed to his troubles with Madrids faster pace brought on by higher altitude.         
	Federer applied a soft drop to set up a break chance in the fifth game of the second set and took a 3-2 lead after Nadal hit long.         
	Nadal rallied the 12,500 spectators at the Magic Box after setting up a break chance in the final game but the Spaniard slapped his crosscourt backhand wide.         
	Federer netted his first match point but replied with his 25th winner to close it out. Nadal, who has already won five titles this season, had only 12 winners.         
	It was Federers first Masters title since Cincinnati in 2007.           (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sushil Kumar draws WFI ire
                                                   Sushil Kumar draws WFI ire
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: The Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) has decided to show cause Olympic bronze medallist Sushil Kumar for getting disqualified in the recently concluded Asian Championship in Thailand .         
	According to sources, WFI president GS Mander will himself issue the show cause letter on Saturday to the countrys best known grappler, who was found overweight in the 66 kg event of the prestigious meet at Pattaya.         
	It was a major embarrassment for India as Sushil was touted as a gold medal hope, said a top official of the WFI. A wrestler getting disqualified for being overweight in a major championship is simply unheard of in professional wrestling. The federation is not going to tolerate such indiscipline.         
	While Sushil said that he was unwell and could not maintain his weight, the WFI felt Sushil did not take things seriously.         
	Sushils coach Yashvir is also likely to be slapped with a show cause notice by the WFI. Sushil defended himself saying that he suddenly fell indisposed during the championships in Thailand . I had fever, so I could not maintain my weight. I did not do it deliberately.         
	Overall, India have done well in the Asian meet, winning a total of six medals in the Greco Roman and freestyle category. While Joginder (55kg) and Dharmender Dalal (120 kg) bagged silver medals, Anil Kumar won a bronze in the 96 kg event.         
	In freestyle, Ramesh Kumar (74 kg) and Anuj Kumar (81 kg) clinched a bronze each. Alka Tomar (59 kg, bronze) was the lone Indian to win a medal in the womens section.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev fails to make   the cut
                                                     Jeev fails to make   the cut
                  Jeev Milkha Singh                           
	Augusta: Jeev Milkha Singhs cold putter left him in agony as the Indian missed the halfway cut at the Augusta Masters by just one stroke on a wind-swept day here on Friday.         
	Struggling to roll his putts in, Jeev brought home three-over 75 for a two-day total of 146 to miss the cut  first time in three appearances  by just one stroke and join the likes of Greg Norman and Ernie Els on the sidelines.         
	My putting let me down. I didnt putt too well and three-putted three times. I didnt hole anything, lamented Jeev.         
	It was one of those days when you hit good putts but they dont go in. I tried in the end and made a good birdie on 18 and hope thats good enough. If not, well try again, he said.         
	With winds swirling at Augusta National, Jeev was in for a torrid time. He turned in 36, with a birdie on five erasing the bogey on the previous hole.         
	But he boarded the bogey train soon after, dropping four shots over a seven-hole stretch before salvaging his round with a final hole birdie.         
	There isnt (room for error). Its a windy day and youre just hanging in there. The three putts were tough to take. You just have to roll the putts in. I think I hit the ball good today (Friday), better than yesterday (Thursday), Jeev said.         
	However, for Jeev, the upside of his week was the two rounds he played with Woods.         
	Ive enjoyed myself. I had a great pairing and he made me feel comfortable out there, said Jeev.         
	Tiger never gives up. Obviously, his recovery is fantastic and mentally hes very good. He makes sure hes got a putt for par and makes a roll at it. If he starts holing putts, hell be up there on Sunday, said Jeev.         
	Jeev began on a strong note on the opening day, with a flawless front nine where he birdied the sixth hole from five feet. Things went a little haywire on his way back but to his credit, Jeev never let things go beyond his control.         
	His back nine journey began and ended in similar fashion, with a bogey, and he found the greenside trap on the 10th hole.         
	A glorious three-iron approach set him up for eagle on the par five 13th hole but he failed to build on the momentum.         
	He had a second birdie on the 17th.                         (PTI)

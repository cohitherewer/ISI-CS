	Napier: Zaheer Khan has no hesitation in admitting that India have their back against the wall but the left-arm seamer feels his team can still save the second Test against a dominating New Zealand.         
	In reply to the hosts massive first-innings total of 619 for nine declared, India slumped to 79 for three at stumps on day two but Zaheer hoped things would be better Saturday.         
	It is a good track. Hopefully, tomorrow will be ours, Zaheer said after second days play. Tomorrow is an important day. Hopefully, we will put it together. Things are looking good as Dravid and Sachin are batting. We have to win the day and come back into the match, said Zaheer, who returned figures of three for 129.         
	Zaheer said: Last year, we had been put in tough situations and we had responded well. Definitely, this time our backs are against the wall but we can win the day with the bat.         
	Zaheer said it was not easy for the bowlers to succeed on McLean Parks docile pitch and also heaped praise on Jesse Ryder whose 201 scripted New Zealands turnaround in the match.         
	We have given everything weve got. As a bowling unit, we have tried everything. Obviously, Ryder is playing well. He scored a double hundred which was a plus for them, Zaheer said.         
	Zaheer said it was quite frustrating to bowl at McLean Park and the bowlers could only try and give their best.         
	A lot of runs have been scored in boundaries. It is difficult to stop boundaries at this small ground. It is frustrating for the fast bowlers. You keep going and create opportunities. Sometimes they go your way, sometimes they dont.         
	The important thing is to keep running in and create those opportunities, the 30-year-old seamer said.         
	Zaheer didnt make much of the dropped catches during the New Zealand innings. It is a team game so I am going to definitely back my teammates. It can happen on the field, you just have to move on.         
	The ace seamer was looking to get the better of Ryder in the rest of the series.         
	He has been batting well. Ill have to give it to him. It was fun bowling to him and it was good to take up that challenge. But I believe the remaining three innings will go my way.           (PTI)

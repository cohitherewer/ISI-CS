The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clarke in doubt
                                                   Clarke in doubt
                      
	Melbourne: A back injury has left Michael Clarke doubtful for Fridays series-deciding fifth and final one-dayer against New Zealand.         
	Team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris confirmed Clarke has soreness in his thoracic spine. The injury is different from the lower-back pain that has troubled Clarke in the past.         
	It flared up during Australias six-wicket victory over New Zealand in Adelaide Tuesday when he opened the batting and bowled eight overs.         
	It is not the lower back, where he usually has problems, but his upper back, Kountouris said.

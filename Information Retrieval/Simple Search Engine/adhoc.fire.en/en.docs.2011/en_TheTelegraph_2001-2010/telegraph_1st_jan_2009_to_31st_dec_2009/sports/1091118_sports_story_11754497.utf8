                                                                                                                                     Great to have a hundred   in India, says Dilshan
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh in Ahmedabad on Tuesday                                 
	Ahmedabad: Tillekaratne Dilshan credits his superb form in Tests this year to a change in attitude and mentality.         
	The openers 112 on Tuesday was his fifth century in 2009. In the process he also became the first Sri Lankan since 1997 to score a century in India.         
	The secret lies in my maturity and mindset. Earlier I used to get out after getting the starts. But now I stay put and play long innings. That has done the trick, Dilshan told newsmen after the second days play in the first Test.         
	Its great having a century in India I enjoyed batting and was disappointed to get out in that fashion I failed to control my shot, he added.         
	Dilshan felt the Lankans were well placed in the match. Were in control now. The first session was good for us. We need to try and bat the first session tomorrow and then consolidate. The wicket is turning and bouncing and weve got a very good chance.         
	He, however, said that the Indian bowlers shouldnt be blamed.         
	All the bowlers bowled well and theres nothing much for them in the wicket. Its tailor-made for the batsmen.         
	The experience of playing in the IPL and Indian conditions helped. It was easy to bat on the wicket, the opener explained.         
	Dilshan said things fell into place for them on Tuesday. The target was to keep India within 450 and we succeeded.         
	The main thing was getting Rahul Dravids wicket and once that happened early we knew we were in with a chance.

  - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 
  - Salute from the captain who revived openers career         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Kumble                                   
	Calcutta:Had Anil Kumble (the then Team India captain) not pressed for Virender Sehwag when the selectors picked the squad for Australia, two years ago, the absolutely amazing opener may have been lost to international cricket forever.         
	Sehwag, who has completed a decade at the highest level, grabbed that opportunity with a capital G and the rest, as they say, is history.  
	Indeed, Sehwags Test average has seen a significant improvement  it was 49.46 (4,155 runs) before the 2007-08 tour of Australia; in the 36 innings since then, it reads 61.29 (2,084 runs).         
	The strike-rate, too, has jumped: 75.75 till Australia; 91.92 thereafter. Its this ferocious pace which leaves the opposition in tatters.         
	More important, Sehwag gives Team India enough time to try and force wins.         
	Kumble, the one Sehwag will always be indebted to, spoke to The Telegraph, from Bangalore, on Thursday evening. The interaction was limited to Sehwag, who needs a mere 16 runs to eclipse even Sir Don Bradman.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Has Sehwag ever thanked you for reviving his career?         
	A (Laughs) He has, yes.         
	Was it on the 2007-08 tour of Australia itself?         
	Does it matter?         
	Sehwag wasnt even among the probables for that tour. What made you ask for him so strongly?         
	Hes a match-winner... On his day, he can win it for you single-handedly... Also, such is Sehwags style, that once he gets going, the oppositions morale goes down very quickly.         
	Did the selectors (the committee was then headed by former captain Dilip Vengsarkar) have reservations?         
	A few, I think, did say that he hadnt been getting runs in domestic cricket... Something was said... Lets say that Sehwags record, his past, made it easier for me.         
	Yet you couldnt play Sehwag in the first two Tests, in Melbourne and in Sydney...         
	That was disappointing... However, we had only one warm-up match and that, too, hit by rain... Then, Yuvraj Singh had done very well in the last Test (Bangalore, against Pakistan) before wed left for Australia... I couldnt leave him out of the XI... I wasnt comfortable getting Rahul Dravid to open (with Wasim Jaffer), but had to... It definitely was a tough call... Sehwag, though, got his chance in the third Test (Perth), which we won... He scored a quick 40-odd in the second innings and followed that up with 63 and 151 in the final Test, in Adelaide.         
	Clearly, Sehwag hasnt looked back after that. Did you expect him to have such an outstanding 23 months in Test cricket?         
	Ive not been surprised. After all, hes such a quality player... When you hit a low, then you begin to think and look to come back stronger... Sehwag did just that.         
	What makes Sehwag so special? Is it his hand-eye coordination alone?         
	No... Youve got to look at his temperament, his attitude... Sehwag looks to score, not survive... Of course, like today (at the CCI), he may initially take the survival route in order to score big... That would be a means to an end.         
	How would you bowl to Sehwag?         
	Id pull a hamstring, not bowl to him!         
	For all his talent, Sehwag often gives it away. Isnt that frustrating?         
	Look, you cant have him playing this way and that... The risk element is there in his batting... Bottomline is that Sehwags an impact-player, who can win you six out of 10 matches. Look at him that way...         
	Could Sehwag better Brian Laras record (400 not out), on Friday?         
	Hes certainly capable of doing that, but is still some distance away... I dont think Sehwag would be thinking of that tonight... That wouldnt be him.         
	The final one: What would be your message to Sehwag?         
	(Laughs) What do I tell somebody who loves playing his natural game? If anything, Id just say carry on...

	Calcutta: Team spirit is the secret of their recent success believes Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa and, according to the Moroccan, it is this that has been the difference between the green and maroon brigade and the other I-League sides this season.         
	The team spirit is the best All have gelled well and thats a very good sign, Karim said after a practice session at the club ground on Sunday.         
	Keen to maintain the good show, Bencharifa, on the eve of their sixth round clash against Mumbai FC, said that the boys will surely go all out to bag full points. Looking to be among the top three after the first-leg of the league, Bencharifa believes consistency will help Bagan in their quest for the league title.         
	Top two or three is a good spot at which to finish the first phase of the I-League. That will help us win the title, he said         
	But consistency is the key. If you can maintain the good show then only can you have a good result in the end We just want to keep the winning momentum going and that is what the boys will be playing for tomorrow (Monday), the Bagan coach said.         
	Bagan after five matches, are placed sixth with 9 points.         
	Bagan have found their scoring touch lately and Bencharifa praised Edeh Chidi for their form in front of goal but rued missing Jose Ramirez Barreto.         
	Chidi has impressed me a lot. He is a strong and quality striker and he is delivering in every match. I hope he keeps scoring. But he needs a player like Barreto.         
	Its unfortunate that Barreto is out He now has three injuries and I feel he requires time to heal. So, we have to be patient, Bencharifa said.         
	Talking about Mondays opponents, Mumbai FC, Bencharifa added: Look, teams playing in the I-League are all very strong. You cannot take them for granted We need to be cautious tomorrow also. Although some of my players are not fully fit we will play for a win.         
	With Rakesh Masih out, Bagan are expected to opt for a 4-4-2 combination at the Barasat Stadium on Monday. While Nigerian Chidi and Ishfaq Ahmed will start together, James Singh and Snehasish Chakraborty will be playing wide. Marcos Pereira and Manish Mathani will be in the mid-field. Sangram Mukherjee will be in goal.         
	Surkumar Singh, N. Mohanraj, Deepak Mondal and Sagram Mandi will be guarding the Bagan citadel.         
	Mumbai FC coach Khalid Jamil, though, knows what to expect: Bagan are a strong side. They are in good form and we need to play safe. There is no room to experiment and the boys know that.

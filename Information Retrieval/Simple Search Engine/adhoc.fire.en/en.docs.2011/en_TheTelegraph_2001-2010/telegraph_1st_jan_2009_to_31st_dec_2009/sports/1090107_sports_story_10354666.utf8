	Chennai: Mumbai appeared on course to make it to the Ranji Trophy final as they reduced Saurashtra to 247 for five on the third day of their semi-final here on Tuesday.         
	Saurashtra still trail by 390 runs with a day left in the match. Mumbai declared their first innings at a mammoth total of 637 for six.         
	Saurashtra batsmen faltered against Mumbais quality bowling attack comprising Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar and spinner Ramesh Powar.         
	Zaheer claimed a brace conceding 40 runs while Agarkar, D. Kulkarni and Powar took a wicket each.         
	At close, Jayesh Shah (45) and K.R. Makwana (0) were at the crease.         
	Saurashtra openers Chirag Pathak and Bhushan Chauhan started off on an aggressive note after Mumbai declared their first innings at the overnight score.         
	But their counterattack was short-lived against Zaheer. The left-arm pacer removed Pathak when the Saurashtra batsman tried to hook a bouncer and holed out at deep square leg. Pathak was dismissed for 30.         
	Veteran Agarkar maintained brilliant line and length and came close to success on a number of occasions.         
	Chauhan, who played second fiddle to hard-hitting Pathak, was bowled in the 12th over. He made 14 and Saurashtra were reduced to 52 for two.         
	Cheteswar Pujara looked good during his stay at the crease but he was done in by Powars extra bounce. The right-hander tried a late cut but edged it straight to Wasim Jaffer at slip. He put on 71 runs for the third wicket with Kotak off 115 balls. His 39 came of 66 balls.         
	The Mumbai bowlers continued their good work and Agarkar and Powar time and again beat the batsmen. Zaheer was more penetrative with a steady line and length.         
	Ravindra Jadeja, the top performer for Saurashtra with the bat and ball this season, also did not stay long at the crease. He was scalped by Zaheer.         
	Jadeja went for a big drive away from his body and got an edge to wicketkeeper Vinayak Samant. He faced 25 balls for his 10 runs.         
	BRIEF SCORES: Mumbai 637/6. Saurashtra 247/5 (S. Kotak 89; Zaheer 2/40). Match to continue.           (AGENCIES)

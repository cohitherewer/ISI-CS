                                                                                                                       7                                      Kumars warning   to seniors
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Kumar Sangakkara is counting on the positives despite losing both the Test and one-day series on this tour. The performances of some of the youngsters have come as a relief, the Sri Lankan captain told a press conference.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Losing the match and the series         
	I thought 315 was a fighting total. Upul Tharanga batted exceptionally well He provided the acceleration to the innings. But we lost despite getting two early wickets The key for the bowlers is to maintain the line and length in such situations but we failed Still, Welegedara, Randiv and Lakmal have been the best bowlers for us in this series. We lost a few of our experienced guys on this tour, but after the youngsters performance the seniors will have to take a look at themselves.         
	If the dew proved to be a decisive factor         
	Probably didnt play a big part Suraj Randiv bowled exceptionally well and so did Dilshan. I thought it was the fast bowling where we lost the match.         
	Thoughts on the tour         
	If you take away the first Test, you will see that our bowling wasnt very penetrative in the remaining two. We were more competitive in the ODIs. We were always in a winning position in all the four games. Its probably been a tour of ifs and buts but very competitive.         
	The positives         
	Chasing more than 400 and almost getting there in the first match Chasing 300 and winning in Nagpur and then again making more than 300 here. The batting of Dilshan and Upul have been encouraging The debutants have shown responsibility. Angelo Mathews has shown his capabilities. We can take a lot of heart from these...

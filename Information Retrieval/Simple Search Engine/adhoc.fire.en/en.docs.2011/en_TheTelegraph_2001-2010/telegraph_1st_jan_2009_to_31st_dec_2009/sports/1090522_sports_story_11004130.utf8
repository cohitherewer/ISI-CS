                                                   Great to be in the last 4: Kumble
            OUR BUREAU                      
	Anil Kumble, captain of the Royal Challengers Bangalore, expressed his happiness on reaching the semi-finals on Thursday, saying it was a nice achievement after their seventh-place finish in the first edition of the Indian Premier League.         
	It was a great feeling today (Thursday). We didnt do too well last year, so, it was nice to move to the semis this year, he said.         
	The Royal Challengers beat the Deccan Chargers by 12 runs in Centurion on Thursday and made it to the semi-finals as the third-placed side. The Chargers, in spite of the loss, too, booked their semi-final berth as the fourth team.         
	While the Delhi DareDevils, the table-toppers, meet the Chargers in the first semi-final on Friday, the Chennai Super Kings will fight it out against the Royal Challengers on Saturday.         
	Kumble lauded his teammates for their spirited effort. Wed begun the IPL well, but our performance dipped midway through the tournament. We suffered four losses on the trot but came back strongly to make it to the last-four stage. All credit goes to the team for achieving the feat, he said.         
	The former India captain showered praises on youngster Manish Pandey, who hit a brilliant 73-ball 114 to help the Bangalore side post a challenging total. It was certainly a brilliant century from Akhil. He had a few opportunities earlier, but didnt get to bat too much as he was coming lower down the order. We took a chance with him today and sent him to open the innings, and it clicked, Kumble said.         
	The Chargers captain Adam Gilchrist said it was bad luck for his side not to be able to finish the league stage on a high. It was bad luck Im a bit disappointed. We have got to improve ourselves ahead of the semis. But its an extremely tight schedule as weve to play our semi-final tomorrow (Friday). I hope to be fresh and prepared for the semi-final, he said.         
	Anybody can win in the semis well have to back ourselves as we did in the last four games. Good that we won today as it wed be able to take this confidence into the semi-finals, he summed up, while speaking about their chances in the last-four stage.         
	Man of the Match Pandey said that he was happy to have made the most of his chance today. It was a good wicket to bat on, with the ball coming on nicely. Its an amazing feeling to have scored a century and helped the team win, he said.

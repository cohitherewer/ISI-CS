The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We panicked: Younis
                                                     We panicked: Younis
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Pakistan and Sri Lanka cricketers line up for their national anthems at Lords on Friday                           
	London: Having blown an excellent chance to put it across formidable contenders Sri Lanka, Pakistan captain Younis Khan could say little besides conceding his team panicked at Lords on Friday.         
	We panicked... Thats the reason (for the 19-run defeat)... Also, weve been struggling with our bowling in the early overs and didnt get a start either, Younis lamented after his teams opening Super Eight engagement.         
	Having restricted Sri Lanka to 150 for seven when, at one stage, it seemed they would finish closer to 200, Pakistan managed no more than 131 for nine.         
	Pakistan, in fact, paid heavily for giving away 20 extras (which included 10 wides and three no balls). Thats a criminal offence in T20.         
	Spearhead Sohail Tanvir, for example, bowled three wides and two no balls in his first over and followed that up with two wides and one no ball in the second.         
	Younis didnt look at him again.         
	Sohail bowled no balls and wides... One cant start that way... Then, when we batted, there werent enough partnerships... Id been happy when we kept Sri Lanka to 150, but we panicked while chasing, Younis said.         
	He added: Partnerships are essential and if somebody gets set, then he should go all the way... The batsmen failed...         
	Younis declined to comment on former chief selector Abdul Qadirs view (expressed at home) that he wouldnt have him in his T20 squad.         
	The captain, however, was his teams top scorer  50 off 37 balls.         
	Of course, Pakistan had their chances... Had their moments, but didnt make the most of them... Having made that point, you must remember the Sri Lankans are very good, Pakistans former coach, Geoff Lawson, told The Telegraph.         
	In a nice gesture, players of both teams stood alternately instead of separately during the pre-match rendition of the national anthems.         
	The proposal had come from the ICC.         
	Significantly, this was the first Pakistan-Sri Lanka clash after the terror strike in Lahore earlier this year.

                                                   Indians on top
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Indian archers lived up to their billing as the favourites with seven gold, one silver and three bronze medals on the final day of the 4th Asian Grand Prix archery meet at the SAI, Eastern Centre, on Saturday.         
	But losing out on a medal in the prestigious mens recurve section will be a cause for regret for the hosts. Indias hopes of clinching at least the bronze in mens recurve rested with Vishwash who unfortunately went down in the playoff to Mark Forrester of Scotland at 104-99.         
	India made a clean sweep of gold, four in all, in the team championships and added three more in the afternoon session in the mens and womens compound and womens recurve.         
	Bangladesh followed India at second with a haul of one gold and one silver. Scotland was third with three silver and two bronze medals. Iran were fourth with two silver and three bronze medals and Bhutan took one silver medal.         
	Chief guest Sultan Ahmed, Union minister of state for tourism, distributed the medals.

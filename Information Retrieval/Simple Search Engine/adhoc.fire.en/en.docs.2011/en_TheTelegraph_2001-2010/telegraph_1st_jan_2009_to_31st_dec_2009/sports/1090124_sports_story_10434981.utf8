The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Azharuddin is playing it safe
                                                     Azharuddin is playing it safe
  - Ex-captain figured in VP Singhs 93 by-election speech       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Azharuddin                                 
	Calcutta: Mohammed Azharuddin is again making headlines in a big way, though clarity is awaited on just how the former cricket captain will fit into the Congress partys scheme of things.         
	Its going to be a vastly different wicket and, today, its interesting recalling that one-time Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh (who passed away recently) had probably been the first to talk of Azhar in an exclusively political speech.         
	VP did so during a by-election in UP, way back in late 1993, a year which had gone rather well for Azhar and his team.         
	Among other things, VP had said: If you have a (Sunil) Gavaskar, there is also an Azharuddin Hed been referring to symbols of national integration in the post-Babri Masjid demolition era.         
	Then, however, Azhar had more or less ruled out entering politics. Much, clearly, has happened since.         
	Look, Im too straight-forward (for politics) All I wish to emphasise is that Im touched by the peoples thoughts, their placing me on a pedestal, he told The Telegraph.         
	That was in early 1994.         
	Till Azhar featured in the match-fixing controversy and got banned for life by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (in late 2000), hed been recognised as somebody whose popularity wasnt limited to a region or community.         
	Someone who could even be turned into a vote-catcher provided, of course, he played ball.         
	Except perhaps the period immediately after the ban, the influential didnt stop courting Azhar and his presence at Iftars and fashion shows (in the company of glamorous second wife Sangeeta/Ayesha), for example, never went unnoticed.         
	Few have possessed more supple wrists and most of Azhars 15,000-plus runs in Tests and ODIs remain quite special.         
	Among the more successful captains of his time, Azhars first innings at the helm lasted from January 1990 to August 1996.         
	Mark Taylor (an authority on leadership), in fact, rates Azhar as one of the top captains he played against.         
	To complete the CV bit, Azhar is widely regarded as Indias finest all-round fielder.         
	While the Azhar-Congress partnership is being finalised, the former captain is himself playing it safe.         
	Not yet, thanks was Azhars reply to an SMS sent by an acquaintance, on Friday, who wished him all the best for an innings on a new turf.         
	He turns 46 on February 8.

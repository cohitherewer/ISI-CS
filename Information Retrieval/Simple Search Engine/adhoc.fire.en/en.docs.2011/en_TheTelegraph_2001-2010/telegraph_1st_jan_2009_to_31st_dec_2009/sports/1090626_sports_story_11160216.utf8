The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fota hopes   new chief   will be less   divisive
                                                   Fota hopes   new chief   will be less   divisive
                                        
	Bologna: Eight leading Formula One teams promised Thursday to slash costs by up to 25 percent in the next two years as part of their accord with the sports ruling body to prevent a breakaway series.         
	A split was averted on Wednesday when FIA president Max Mosley capitulated and scrapped a planned voluntary budget cap and instead issued an unquantified  and unenforceable  edict to reduce costs to early 1990s levels.         
	With Mosley also forced out of office after 16 years, the Formula One Teams Association (Fota) hopes Octobers election will produce a successor who is less divisive, allowing the teams to return to providing drama on the track  not off it.         
	And they hope to achieve that by spending less. We will continue to work as teams and manufacturers to reduce costs, as we have with engines and gear boxes, Ferrari principal Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, who led the discussions with FIA, said after a Fota meeting in Bologna.         
	Our goal is in two years to have costs as we did in the early 1990s. We are aiming to save a further 15-25 per cent by 2011. For big and small teams it is important to think about the balance between costs and revenue.         
	Fota, which also includes McLaren, BMW Sauber, Renault, Toyota, Red Bull, Toro Rosso and Brawn GP, had already implemented a series of cost-cutting measures themselves this season amid the global economic downturn. They included restricting on-track testing and the use of wind tunnels for aerodynamic testing, while further savings on engines and gearboxes are in the pipeline.         
	Already the savings have resulted in 15-25 per cent saved and we will see further savings in the next few seasons, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said.         
	McLaren counterpart Martin Whitmarsh hoped the teams united front would endure to help F1 develop. In all the years I have been involved in Formula One, I have never witnessed an agreement between the teams, Whitmarsh said.

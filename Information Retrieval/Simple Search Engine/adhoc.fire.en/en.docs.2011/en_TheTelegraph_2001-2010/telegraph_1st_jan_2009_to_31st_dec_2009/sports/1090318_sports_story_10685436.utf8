                                                Selectors rsquo; decision   irks Smith  Melbourne: The omission of Neil McKenzie and Morne Morkel from South Africa rsquo;s squad for the third Test against Australia, and initially naming Ashwell Prince as captain has upset Graeme Smith. The indisposed captain hinted at a rift between the selectors and the team management on those issues.  Prince was initially named captain of the Proteas for the third Test but he refused since he was not happy with the opener rsquo;s role. ldquo;Six months ago, I proposed the idea of a vice-captain to be named across all three teams (Test, one-day and Twenty20), rdquo; said Smith. ldquo;Although I never envisioned a situation like this when I discussed the idea, this would bring clarity on these types of issues. rdquo;  He also expressed disappointment at the way McKenzie and Morkel were dropped from the side after losing the Test series 0-2.

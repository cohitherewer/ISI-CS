The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Coach: Credit goes to boys
                                                                                                                                   Coach: Credit goes to boys
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: New East Bengal coach Phillippe de Ridder looked a satisfied man after the teams 3-0 win over Lajong FC on Thursday. Nice to have a winning start. Credit goes to the players. They were fantastic on the day. They showed fighting spirit and never gave up, he said.         
	De Ridder said that not giving Abel Hammond a start was a tactical move. I was just seeing how the team reacts. But Bhaichung Bhutia got injured so I had to bring him in early, he said. Hammond is a good player and showed his class on the day, he said.         
	The Belgian also heaped praises on his defence and was not surprised to see Uga Okpara getting the Man of the Match award although Hammond struck a brace. We kept a clean slate. The defence was very compact and confident. So I think it was a fair decision, he said.         
	De Ridder conceded that his team were fumbling in the second half but said these things happen in football. Its difficult to maintain the tempo all the time. I made some changes and everything was normal after that, he said.         
	Man of the Match Okpara, too, was happy with the teams performance and attributed it to the new coach. Our coach is good and I think his presence is making a difference. Its a big win for us, he said.         
	Lajong coach Stanley Rozario was sad but not disheartened. We were bad in the first half but after the change of ends we were very good. In fact, we could have won the match. But in the end our inexperience cost us dearly.

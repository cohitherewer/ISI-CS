	London: Arsenal romped into the semi-finals of Champions League with a crushing 3-0 home defeat of Villarreal on Wednesday to seal a 4-1 aggregate victory and a last-four clash with holders Manchester United.         
	Theo Walcott set the tone for a surprisingly one-sided encounter with an early opener before Emmanuel Adebayors second goal of the tie on the hour and a Robin van Persie penalty finished off Villarreal who had Sebastian Eguren sent off, as reported in Thursdays Late City edition.         
	Villarreals hopes of Champions League glory were also ended by Arsenal in 2006. However, while that semi-final meeting between the sides was on a knifes edge until the very end, Arsenal were miles ahead of their disappointing opponents this time and could have won by a much larger margin.         
	After the fireworks across London on Tuesday when Chelsea scrambled an incredible 7-5 aggregate victory over Liverpool, Arsenals fans were spared any anxiety as the rejuvenated Gunners continued their late-season surge that could yet end the north London clubs four-year wait for silverware.         
	Thousands streamed out of the Emirates well before the end, their thoughts already turning to Saturdays FA Cup semi-final date with Chelsea at Wembley.         
	We did very well but we didnt want to be greedy because we have a (FA Cup) semi-final in three days, captain Cesc Fabregas said. Villarreal were never dangerous and we were always in control. Now lets focus on Chelsea.         
	Adebayors stunning equaliser in the El Madrigal last week meant a 0-0 draw would have sufficed in the second leg. However, Arsene Wengers side were clearly intent on killing off Villarreal early and the Spaniards were left reeling by Arsenals pace in the opening exchanges.         
	Walcott dazzled all night for Arsenal and gave experienced Spain left back Joan Capdevila a torrid time. After 10 minutes, the England winger raced on to a deft flick from Fabregas and coolly lobbed it over goalkeeper Diego Lopez. Adebayor made no mistake after 60 minutes, slotting past Lopez following a defence-splitting pass from van Persie. The Dutchman then completed the rout from the spot.

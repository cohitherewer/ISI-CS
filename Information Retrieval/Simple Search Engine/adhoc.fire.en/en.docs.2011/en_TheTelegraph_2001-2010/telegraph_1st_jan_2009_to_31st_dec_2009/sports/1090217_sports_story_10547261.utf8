The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Injury not a worry for Nadal
                                                     Injury not a worry for Nadal

	Madrid: World number one Rafael Nadal said on Monday that all he needed was some rest to recover from the knee problem that hampered his performance in the World Indoor Tournament final in Rotterdam.         
	Nadal lost 6-3, 4-6, 6-0 to Andy Murray on Sunday with his right knee causing him greater discomfort than the Britons ankle complaint.         
	It isnt the knee, its lower down. Its a strain on a tendon that, above all else, stops me from serving well.         
	But we are almost certain that there wont be any problems, Nadal told reporters in Madrid.         
	The Spaniard is due to compete in Dubai next week and after that he has Spains Davis Cup opener against Serbia in Benidorm starting on March 6.         
	It wont be a problem for the Davis Cup, he added.         
	Its just a question of having a little rest. I also expect to be in Dubai, but we shall see.         
	The season has just started but I have already played a lot of games in a short space of time.         
	Its a problem of muscular fatigue, the Spaniard added.           (REUTERS)

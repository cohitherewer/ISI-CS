The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I find myself in his batting: Richards
                                                                                                                                     I find myself in his batting: Richards
  - Sledging only strengthened tendulkars concentration: Waugh               Sachin Tendulkar                           
	Sachin Tendulkar completes 20 years of international cricket on Sunday. Some legends heaped praise on the Little Master II.         
	Following are what they have said about Tendulkar (alphabetically):               
	Inzamam-ul Haq: What has impressed me the most about Tendulkar all these years is his humble and simple nature. I never saw him let the fame and adulation he enjoys get to his head.         
	Javed Miandad: He (Sachin) loves cricket and with his hard work, focus and commitment he has truly become an outstanding ambassador for the sport at a time when commercialism is so rampant.         
	Abdul Qadir: I was at my best in 1989 and even the best batsmen had second thoughts coming out to hit me. I remember I kept on goading him to hit me and he took the challenge and came down to strike me cleanly. It was amazing. I knew instantly this was someone special.         
	Vivian Richards: When he is in full flow, the mild-mannered boyish cricketer can look extremely intimidating. If there is a resonance, I find of myself in his batting, it is in that intent he communicates. If I were to make a distinction between Brian (Lara) and Sachin (Tendulkar), it would be to point that Sachin was a more committed individual. He was more consistent in his commitment to the team.         
	Steve Waugh: I watched Sachin hitting a spectacular 175 the other day and once again I felt that I was watching a player who comes once in a century. He is the Bradman of our times and I do feel privileged to have played a lot of cricket against him. On his day Sachin could take a game away from under your nose very quickly. His uncanny ability to find gaps, his running between the wickets and his sheer presence at the wicket was unsettling for the opposition.         
	Sachin rarely got into verbal duels and soon we too realised that sledging him only strengthens his concentration and resolve. No wonder then that some of the most talkative Australians went quiet when Sachin was in the middle.

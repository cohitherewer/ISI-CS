                                                                                                                                   Indian colts lose to Oman 3-4
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Indian colts squandered a 3-1 lead to lose 3-4 to Oman in their Asian under-19 Group C qualifying match in Iraq on Tuesday. This was their third defeat in as many matches.         
	Yet to log a point in the six-team meet, India played some good football after Rajaibi Basim Abdullah Taeeb put Oman ahead in the fourth minute. In the next half-an-hour, India struck thrice, raising hopes of their first victory after back to back loses against hosts Iraq and Saudi Arabia.         
	Lalrindika Ralte restored parity for India in the 15th minute when he made most of a throw-in that landed inside the rival box. He struck again four minutes later and another goal by Akshay Mall put India in the drivers seat.         
	Coach Colin Toals team, however, proved no match for Oman in the second session. Like in the match against Saudi Arabia, India conceded three goals in the last 15 minutes for yet another defeat.         
	Toal, who cited poor supervision as one of the reasons for defeat in the previous match, admitted that India had been beaten by a better team.

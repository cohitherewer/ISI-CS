The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bose, Saha fashion win
                                                   Bose, Saha fashion win
                            
	Cuttack: East Zone displayed a superb team effort to beat defending champions Central by 18 runs and set up a date with West in the final of the Deodhar Trophy, here on Monday.         
	The match was reduced to 48-over-a-side because of a 30-minute delayed start owing to bad light in the morning.         
	Central captain Mohammed Kaif decided to field first but his bowlers failed to make any early inroads. Wriddhiman Saha (69) and Nataraj Behera (28), once again, provided East with a solid start as they shared a 99-run opening wicket stand. Saha and Behera had stitched together a 98-run partnership in the match against North.         
	Saha played an elegant innings to notch up his second half-century of the tournament. He hit eight fours and one six in his 76-ball innings.         
	Ishank Jaggi chipped in with a 51-ball 48 while Saurabh Tiwary played a breezy knock of 40 off 32 balls to help East set Central a target of 258.         
	For Central, Murali Kartik came up with the best bowling performance taking two wickets for 21 runs. Central were in trouble from the very onset of their chase, slumping to 10 for three in the 5th over, losing both their openers and Kaif. Jalaj Saxena (25) and Ravikant Shukla (20) tried to stitch together a partnership but could do little as, by the 16th over, Central were tottering at 69 for 6.         
	Bhuvneshwar Kumar (72) and Piyush Chawla (93) put up a brave performance to keep Central in the fight. But East captain Manoj Tiwarys part-time spin provided the crucial breakthrough as Kumar was stumped in the 43rd over. Chawlas 96-ball effort saw him hit five fours and three sixes.         
	Ranadeb Bose was the pick of the East bowlers scalping three wickets for 46 runs while Ashok Dinda picked up two.         
	Central were bundled out for 238 in the 48th over.         
	Four-time Deodhar winners East will cross swords with eight-time champions West in the final on Wednesday.           (PTI)

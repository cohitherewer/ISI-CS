	London: Even with five months of the season remaining, Liverpool striker Fernando Torres has conceded that the Premier League title is out of reach.         
	That will make Sundays match against Arsenal even more painful for the Spaniard. Arsenal might be third in the standings  eight points behind leader Chelsea  but Liverpool is a further four adrift in seventh.         
	With Liverpool also exiting the Champions League at the group stage after Wednesdays 2-1 defeat by Fiorentina, the top two prizes have gone. All players have to fight for is the FA Cup, the Europa League trophy and ensuring they finish in the top four to qualify for Europes elite competition next season.         
	We now change our targets, he said. We have to think the Europa League and FA Cup are the two competitions we can win this season and obviously trying to stay in the top four.

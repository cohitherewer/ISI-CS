            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Wellington: New Zealand vice-captain Brendon McCullum said the team need to stand up and show some character to force a draw in the third Test. The wicketkeeper-batsman said they were disappointed with their performance in the first innings, when they were bowled out below 200.               
	The following are excerpts               
	If New Zealand can force a draw         
	Thats what we got to believe we could do. We dont find ourselves in the ideal situation but tomorrow is an opportunity for guys to stand up and show some character. We have to show some character. Loss is not the desired result We know we will not draw the series If we can get out of this match with a draw         
	The New Zealand batting         
	Disappointing again. In the first innings, being bowled out for 200, left us in a pretty tough situation in the game. Obviously the top order will be pretty disappointed they missed out again today. We have got a partnership formed late this afternoon. Hopefully with a couple of batters still to come, we can get out of this with a draw.         
	If he was surprised with the late declaration by India         
	I guess I was a little bit surprised. I thought they might have wanted to give themselves in excess of 80-odd overs to maybe pick the second new ball today, if it had gone the full duration. For one reason or another they decided to bat on this morning. Whether it was to give themselves a little bit more rest or whether it was to play some mind-games with us, I am not too sure.         
	What went wrong for NZ in the series?         
	You can always look back on the things that you may or may not have done differently. We were under the illusion that this wicket was gonna give us some bounce, and it would be our best opportunity to try and win the Test match. We got them into a situation where we could have capitalised and for one reason or another we were not able to finish them off.         
	What will be New Zealands strategy on Tuesday?         
	From our perspective, we have got to last five sessions. Thats what our goal is.We have to try and learn to be confident, and bat five sessions.         
	If the hosts are praying for rain         
	You cant pray for rain or you cant expect rain to get you out of the situation. Hopefully we can grow in character and get out of this one.

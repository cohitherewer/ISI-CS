                                                     Brendon is best suited to lead KKR: Steve
    - Buchanan more of a professional manager, says former Aussie Captain           A STAFF REPORTER            Steve Waugh in the city on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Former Australia captain Steve Waugh feels Brendon McCullum is the best man to lead the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), notwithstanding the teams shoddy performance so far in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	At a press conference on Wednesday after playing cricket with kids at Udayan, a home for the children of leprosy sufferers, Waugh spoke on the IPL, the lacklustre performance of the Kolkata Knight Riders and on the multiple captains theory.         
	He also said he has talked to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) about organising a few T20 matches for the Steve Waugh Foundation.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On John Buchanans multiple-captains theory         
	The theory created great controversy everywhere, especially in Calcutta. But all said and done, it was not implemented in IPL2. I can see only one captain on the field and that is Brendon McCullum. So, I dont think I should comment on it.         
	On Sourav being dropped as KKR captain         
	Sourav Ganguly is very resilient He is undoubtedly a much experienced leader and has done very well for India. But he has left captaincy quite a few years back. McCullum, on the other hand, is young and energetic.         
	He has also achieved a lot in international cricket. In my opinion, he is the one best suited to lead the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	The poor performance of the KKR         
	Apart from everything else, the team has to pull up its socks in fielding.         
	To win matches, you have to field properly and take your catches. Maybe, they will bounce back and win the remaining five matches.         
	On Buchanan as coach         
	The players are more important than a coach. John (Buchanan) is a good coach but he is more of a professional manager. He can bring unity to the side.         
	Buchanans relationship with Shane Warne         
	They have always treaded separate paths They have never exchanged Christmas greetings, as far as I know.         
	If international cricket has missed an exciting captain in Warne         
	He has great potential to navigate a cricket team. He is doing a wonderful job with the Rajasthan Royals as captain and coach.         
	But leading an IPL T20 team is completely different from leading in international cricket.         
	On what he thought of T20 cricket and the IPL         
	It is a great format. If I were 10 years younger, I would have loved to turn out in the IPL.         
	The tournament also proves beneficial when it comes to unearthing hidden cricketing talent as we saw in the cases of Shaun Marsh, David Hussey and Yusuf Pathan, to name a few.         
	On Udayan         
	Udayan is like my second home. Attachment with it gives me satisfaction.         
	On the present Australian side         
	They have won the World Cup three consecutive times and they will bounce and win again, whatever they are going through right now.

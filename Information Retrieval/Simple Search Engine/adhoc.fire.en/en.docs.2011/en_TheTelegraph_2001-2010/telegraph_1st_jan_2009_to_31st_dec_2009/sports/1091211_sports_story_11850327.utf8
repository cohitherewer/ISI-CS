The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ashour reigns supreme
                                                                                                                       7                                        Ashour reigns supreme
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Egypts Ramy Ashour with the PSA Masters trophy at Bombay Gymkhana in Mumbai on Friday. (PTI)                           
	Mumbai: Ramy Ashour wasnt at his best but still was good enough to outgun Englands Nick Mathew and win the $152,500 PSA World Tour Super Series squash title, here on Thursday.         
	It was an error-ridden display from both the players but Ashour, the former world champion from Egypt, handled the crucial points better to emerge a 11-6, 9-11, 11-9, 11-9 winner in the hour-and-19-minute final.         
	Ashour made quite a few errors in the front as his drop shots kept hitting the tin while Mathew struggled with his retrieves. There were lets on match point as neither player could get into a position for the shot.         
	The Englishman in particular seemed short on stamina as he repeatedly called for the floor to be mopped in an attempt to regain his breath. He was also twice given a code of conduct warning, for racquet abuse at the end of the first game and then for hitting the ball out of the stadium at the end of the second.         
	It was a rubbish match. We both played terribly but on big points he attacked better than me, said Mathew.

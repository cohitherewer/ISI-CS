	Manchester: Manchester United are sending defender Rio Ferdinand for another scan on the back injury that has sidelined him for five games.         
	After training all week without any problems, Ferdinand was pulled out of Sundays 3-0 victory over Chelsea at Old Trafford after a back spasm early in the day.         
	We are sending him for another scan because we want to get to the bottom of the problem, United manager Alex Ferguson said.           (AP)

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Lebanon and Kyrgyzstan did India a good turn when they played out a 1-1 draw in the five-nation ONGC-Nehru Cup at the Ambedkar Stadium on Tuesday.         
	With both the teams, especially Lebanon, losing points, India should be a much relieved team on their eve of their crucial match against Sri Lanka on Wednesday.         
	While Kyrgyzstan with one point from three matches are out of the tournament, Lebanon now have four points from three outings. India, who have three points from two matches, will go to the second place behind Syria in the points table if they manage to win against Sri Lanka.         
	The two top teams in the round robin will meet in the final to be played on August 31.         
	After a goalless first half, Anton Zemlianuhin put Kyrgyzstan ahead in the 48th minute. A strong shooter of the ball, Zemlianuhin unleashed a pile driver from around 25 yards that crashed into the net.         
	Stung by the reverse, Lebanon increased pressure and found the equaliser in the 56th minute. After Mohammed El Ali crossed in the goalmouth, Abbas Ahmad Atwi rushed in to place the ball in with a low shot.         
	If Kyrgyzstan were a reformed side in the first half, then Lebanon found their bearings at least to some extent in the second session.         
	Kyrgyzstan started on a rousing note and came close to scoring twice in the first 15 minutes.         
	Lebanon were lucky not to concede a goal in the seventh minute when Zemlianuhins powerful shot shook the post before coming back to play.         
	Three minutes later Almazbek Mirzaliev had another try at the Lebanon goal that was parried away by the goalkeeper Lary Mehanna at the last moment.         
	Teams         
	Lebanon: Lary Mehanna; Mohammed Korhani, Ali Al Saadi, Bilal El Najjarine and Ali Hammam; Hassan Maatouk, Ali El Atat, Ali Yaakoub (Amer Khan, 78th ) and Hussein Amine; Mohammed El Ali and Abbas Ahmad Atwi.         
	Kyrgyzstan: Pavel Matiash; Sergey Chikishev, Rustem Usanov and Vladimir Kasian; Davron Askarov, Roman Ablanikov (Pavel Sidorenko, 62nd ), Vadim Harchenko, Aibek Bokoev and Ildar Amirov (Artem Muladjanov, 76th ); Almazbek Mirzaliev (Mirlan Murzaev, 63rd ) and Anton Zemlianuhin.         
	Referee: Miron Abdul Hannan (Bangladesh).

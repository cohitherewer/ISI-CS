The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mallya is still optimistic 
                                                   Mallya is still optimistic 
                      
	Nuerburgring: Taking positives, and not points, has been the recurring theme in Force Indias F1 story so far but chairman Vijay Mallya still holds on to his optimism and believes the team can accomplish the elusive in the Hungarian Grand Prix later this month.         
	Its just a shame that after such a great weekend we dont have any points to show for it. But thats motorsport  these incidents happen, Mallya said after the teams disappointing German GP campaign.         
	The next race is only a couple of weeks so well refocus on this and try to finish the job in Hungary, he added.         
	Force India made all the right moves going into the German GP with both Adrian Sutil and Giancarlo Fisichella posting top six times in Fridays practice sessions.         
	Sutil sprang another surprise by gatecrashing Q3 and booking himself the seventh slot on the starting grid, his and the teams best position ever.         
	The ending to Sutils fairytale home race, however, was anything but.         
	In a repeat of last years Monaco GP Ferrari driver Kimi Raikkonen crashed into Sutils VJM02, while the German was exiting the pits running a surprising second, claiming the front wing and necessitating an emergency pit stop that put paid to all point hopes.         
	Sutil was in tears after last years Monaco mishap but the young German seemed to have matured this time as he took the setback in his stride. Overall I think weve learnt a lot. Its the first time starting in the top 10 and its a different race up there. Its been a good push for everyone in the team to get some more development, Sutil said.

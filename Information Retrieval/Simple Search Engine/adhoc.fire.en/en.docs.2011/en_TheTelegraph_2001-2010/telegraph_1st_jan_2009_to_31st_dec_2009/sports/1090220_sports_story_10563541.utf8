                                                   Bob stresses on exposure
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: National coach Bob Houghton told the All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Thursday that the Indian team needs to play more international matches to prepare for the 2011 Asian Cup.         
	Houghton, who attended the AIFF executive committee meeting in the capital, told members that it would be impossible to do well in the continental championship without the necessary exposure.         
	According to Houghton, the national team are playing few matches a year, which is totally inadequate, said an executive committee member. He was looking for a bigger programme.         
	After hearing Houghton out, the acting president of the AIFF, Praful Patel decided to form a committee to chalk out detailed plans for the national teams preparations for the AFC Cup, the Olympic qualifiers and the Asian Games.         
	Patel said that the three vice-presidents of the federation along with the national coach, technical director Colin Toal and a few other technically competent people would be the members of the committee, which will submit its report to the federation president.

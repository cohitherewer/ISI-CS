The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Another surgery on Thilan
                                                     Another surgery on Thilan
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Thilan Samaraweera on arrival in Colombo from Lahore                           
	Calcutta: Sri Lankas solid middle-order batsman Thilan Samaraweera, who took a bullet and pieces of shrapnel on his body in the Lahore terror strike, underwent another surgery, on his left leg, on Tuesday afternoon.         
	According to a well-placed source of The Telegraph, whod called on Samaraweera (at the Nawaloka Hospital in Colombo) a couple of hours after the latest surgery, the 32-year-old was fine, though a bit groggy.         
	The first surgery on that very leg had been last Wednesday, soon after the traumatised Sri Lanka team returned home on a special flight.         
	Its not official, but one learns that Samaraweera, whod been in the form of his life during the Test series which ended amidst gunfire and grenades, aggregating an awesome 469 runs (two double hundreds) in three innings, could remain in hospital for another seven-eight days.         
	Its tough on all the players, particularly those (Samaraweera, Ajantha Mendis) still in hospital, as every visitor wants them to relive last Tuesdays horror, off the Gaddafi They cant be rude and say they wont talk about it Hopefully, the visitors will become more considerate, the source said.         
	Top-notch spinner Mendis, its understood, will probably be in hospital for two-three days more. Hell be discharged after the stitches, both in lower part of his head (right side) and the back, have been removed.         
	Probably because Mendis is unmarried, unlike Samaraweera (who has two daughters), hes generally taken it a bit better This evening, at least, he looked pretty relaxed, the source pointed out.         
	While Samaraweera is bed-ridden, Mendis moves about in his room.         
	Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has engaged a lady psychologist, Dr Shanez Fernando, to counsel the Mahela Jayawardenes.         
	That SLC would be seeking the help of local experts only (for the time being, certainly) had been clarified by chief executive Duleep Mendis on Monday.

    Bhajji support
    Jalandhar: As the clamour against the doosra gained momentum in Australia, star Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh on Thursday sprang in defence of the delivery that has earned him many wickets.
    ldquo;May be that is the view in Australia and I have nothing to do with it. In rest of the cricket-playing countries, including India, every player wants to add variations to his bowling and I think all the youngsters should learn it, rdquo; Harbhajan said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | NZ win gold, India bronze
                                                                                                                       7                                      NZ win gold, India bronze
                      
	Salta: New Zealand qualified for next years elite Champions Trophy after scoring a 4-2 win over Pakistan in the final of the Champions Challenge Hockey tournament Sunday.         
	And the Indians overcame a two-goal deficit to eke out a 3-2 win over Argentina and finish with the bronze.         
	India were trailing 0-2. V Raghunath (35th minute), Gurbaz Singh (54th) and Dhananjay Mahadik (69th) sounded the board to complete the win.         
	In the final, between the two top ranked teams penalty-corner specialist Sohail Abbas scored in seventh minute to put Pakistan ahead 1-0.         
	Black sticks replied with a penalty-corner conversion 10 minutes later with Ryan Archibald deflecting on the post. In the 20th minute, New Zealand scored a sumptuous goal with Phillip Burrows, diving full length to deflect a cross from the left, giving his team a 2-1 lead.         
	Pakistan could not penetrate the compact rivals defence and tried to use long passes but in vain. In the last minute of first-half, Rehan Butt pounced on a ball in the crowded circle and acrobatically managed to shoot it out of reach of Pontifex, levelling the scores.         
	Meanwhile, Indias hopes to qualify for Champions Trophy were dashed after their semi-final defeat to Pakistan in the semi-finals.

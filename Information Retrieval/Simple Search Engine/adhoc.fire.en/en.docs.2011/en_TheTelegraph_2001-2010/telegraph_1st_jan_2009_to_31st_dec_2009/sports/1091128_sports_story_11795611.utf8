The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kumar blames the loose shots
                                                                                                                       7                                        Kumar blames the loose shots
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Sreesanth on Friday                           
	Kanpur: Loose shots, poor form of his bowlers, Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara has too many issues to sort out before the Mumbai Test.         
	In the post-match press conference, on Friday, Sangakkara talked about the task ahead and reflected on the mistakes committed during the second Test.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Mission unaccomplished         
	It is obviously disappointing that we will have to wait for another tour to win a Test series in India. But there is still a lot to play for. We still have a Test match to go. Now, our aim would be to level the series.         
	Poor shot selection in the first innings         
	I agree that we played a few loose shots. Weve got to be more responsible in shot selection. Those shots (referring to his own and Samaraweeras shot, which got them out) were really uncalled for. More so because Sreesanth was bowling very well then. He was getting the ball to swing both ways. We had the ability to see through that spell of his, which we didnt. Had we scored around 400 to 450 in our first innings, we could have saved the Test.         
	Mahela Jayawardenes run out in the second innings         
	It was another needless dismissal. It was bad judgement of a single. When I pushed the ball, it wasnt in Yuvrajs hand, but somehow it spun, and came to him.         
	Steps that should be taken for winning in Mumbai         
	We need to play really well to pull it back. There are 16 players in the dressing room. Everyone needs to believe we can win the Test.         
	Dropping Sehwag on a duck         
	That proved to be a very costly mistake in the context of the match. At this level, youve got to take your chances as they dont come easily.         
	Muttiah Muralidharans off form         
	I must admit that our spin department lacked penetration. Muralis form is a concern. But we must back him. Im sure hell deliver the goods as he has done more often than not..         
	On Gautam Gambhirs absence         
	I dont think that Gambhir alone can be a factor. India are a great side.

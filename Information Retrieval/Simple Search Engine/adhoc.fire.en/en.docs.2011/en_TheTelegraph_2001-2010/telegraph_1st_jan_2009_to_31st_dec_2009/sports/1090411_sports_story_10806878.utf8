The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gagan wins bronze at ISSF meet
                                                   Gagan wins bronze at ISSF meet
                      
	New Delhi: Indian shooting star Gagan Narang Friday won the bronze medal in the mens 10 metre air rifle event of the first ISSF World Cup of the year in Chongwon, Korea.         
	Narang fired an aggregate of 696.7 which included a score of 594/600 in the qualification. He entered the finals as the eighth and last shooter but made up the difference by shooting scores of 102.7 to finish on the podium.         
	Both gold and silver medals were clinched by China with Zho Qinan and Cao Yifei scoring 700.3 (597+103.3) and 698.6 (595+103.6) respectively.         
	Another Indian in the fray, Sanjeev Rajput also reached the finals at fifth place with a score of 595 but was relegated to seventh place with a poor final round of 100.4.         
	His compatriot P.T. Raghunath failed to qualify for the finals after shooting only 591.         
	As many as 38 Indian rifle and pistol shooters are competing in the April 9-15 event. They will then travel to Beijing for the second leg of the 2009 World Cup series from April 17-23.         
	Narang said he was happy he started the 2009 season with a medal after doing well last year.         
	I am happy I ended the 2008 World Cup season on the podium with the two world records and now started the new season of 2009 with a podium finish again, he said.         
	This year will be more about experimenting for me so that I can get ready for next year as it is a golden year for shooting, he added. (PTI)

                                                   NSW looking to blunt Sabres
                      
	Hyderabad: New South Wales Blues will have to forget the Trinidad amp; Tobago nightmare and get their act together if they desire to stay alive in the tournament as they take on Somerset Sabres in a must-win League A match of the inaugural Champions League here Sunday.         
	NSWs campaign in the Twenty20 event was dealt a severe blow by a little-known Trinidad batsman, Kieron Pollard, who made a sensational 18-ball 54 to not only fashion an unimaginable four-wicket win over the Australian side, but also took his team a step closer towards a semi-final spot.         
	The Australian side not only has to beat the Sabres by a good margin, their fate will also depend on the outcome of the last League A match between Trinidad amp; Tobago and Diamond Eagles.         
	On the other hand, for the Sabres, the match is only of academic interest as they are already out of contention for a semi-final berth, having lost to Diamond Eagles Thursday.

	Christchurch: New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori says the prospect of facing Indian big-hitters like Virender Sehwag and Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the upcoming home series is pretty scary as it will be tough to contain them on the small grounds here.         
	The last time India toured New Zealand six years ago they went down 0-2 in Tests and lost the one-day series 2-5. But Indias current form has Vettori worried. The New Zealand captain said stopping Dhoni and Sehwag could turn into a nightmare for his bowlers.         
	You look at the individual players and some of the worlds best are coming, Vettori said. Dhoni and Sehwag batting on the little grounds in New Zealand is pretty scary, the leg-spinner said.         
	However, Vettori is seeking comfort from Indias past record here. You balance that with them being notorious for not touring New Zealand all that well, he said.         
	Vettori said he is hoping to take some positives out of the drawn one-day series against Australia.         
	New Zealand could claim moral victory though Ricky Pontings men retained the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy after the series finished 2-2 with the decider being abandoned.         
	The India series is going to be huge backing up after Australia, but hopefully we can take confidence into the series, Vettori said.

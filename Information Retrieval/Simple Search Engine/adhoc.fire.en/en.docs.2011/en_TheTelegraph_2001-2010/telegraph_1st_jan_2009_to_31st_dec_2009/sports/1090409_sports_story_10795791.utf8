The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India stay on course
                                                   India stay on course
                      
	Ipoh: A resurgent India blanked Malaysia 3-0 on Wednesday to put their Azlan Shah Cup campaign back on track and stay on course for a place in the final of the hockey tournament.         
	Arjun Halappa (19th minute) and captain Sandeep Singh (31) sounded the board to put India 2-0 ahead by the breather and G.S. Chandi then rounded off the tally with his 62nd minute strike to complete the rout.         
	After their 2-2 draw against a lowly Egypt in the opener, Harendra Singhs wards badly needed a win to stay afloat in the tournament. It was not supposed to be a cakewalk, considering Malaysia had maintained a clean slate so far, having beaten Pakistan and Egypt.         
	In contrast, Indias performance in the drawn match against Egypt was nothing to write home about and Sandeep Singh and his men had their task cut out. To their credit, the Indians showed a lot of purpose, and while they managed to bring down the Malaysian citadel thrice, their own defence did a tidy job, keeping the opponent strikers at bay.         
	After dominating the first half, the Indians tended to relax in the second session, which allowed Malaysia to make a few inroads even though they could not cap the attacks.

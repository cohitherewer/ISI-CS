	New Delhi/ Calcutta: N.S.Manju has once again found favour with national coach Bob Houghton as the Mohun Bagan defender has been recalled to the national camp beginning June 22 in Delhi. Manju, who shot to fame during Indias tour of Pakistan in 2005, lost his place in the national team following the SAFF Cup in Male and Colombo.         
	Apart from Manju, there are no surprises in the list of campers and Houghton has certainly decided to stick to the tested lot. The camp is expected to go on till July 7 before the squad leaves for either Portugal or Spain to play a few preparatory matches prior to the Nehru Cup in August.         
	At the moment, there are 11 boys from Bengal  six from East Bengal and five from Bagan. The equation, however, may change after the inter-state transfers, which starts on June 1.         
	In Calcutta, the red and gold brigade shot off a letter to the AIFF refusing to release their players in any tournament other than the Fifa-affiliated ones.

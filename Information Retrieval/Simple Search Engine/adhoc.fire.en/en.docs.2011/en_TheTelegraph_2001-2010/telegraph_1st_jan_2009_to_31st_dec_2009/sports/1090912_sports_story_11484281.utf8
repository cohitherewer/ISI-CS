The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India are now No.1 in ODIs
                                                     India are now No.1 in ODIs
            A CORRESPONDENT            Sachin Tendulkar in action on Friday                           
	Colombo: Sachin Tendulkar made an impressive return to the one-day International fold on Friday as he led his team to a six-wicket victory over New Zealand in the tri-series. While Sachin, who last played an ODI on March 8 against the same opponents in Christchurch, scored 46, Rahul Dravid, who too made a comeback to the ODIs after 22 months, struggled for his 45-ball 14.               
	India overtook South Africa to be No. 1 in the ODI ratings. While India have 128 points after Fridays win, South Africa are on 127               
	India also moved into the final after New Zealand lost both their matches.         
	Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni agreed that Sachins innings provided the ideal start to their chase. Sachin gave us the perfect start. He almost carried his innings through and that eased things for us. Raina, too, batted well for his unbeaten 45, Dhoni said.         
	Praising his bowlers for restricting the Black Caps to a paltry 155, Dhoni said: After losing the toss, the seamers did an excellent job. (Ashish) Nehra did well by picking up the early wickets and was well supported by RP Singh. And then Yuvraj (Singh) did so well as the part-time spinner He has been the new find for us and is bowling really well!         
	The right-hander, who scored an unbeaten 35, dismissed the view that the No. 1 spot in ODIs was on his teams mind. We arent thinking about that. We are more concerned about the job on the field. Of course everyone wants to be the No. 1, but if you do well on the field, you will automatically be at the top at some point of time, he reasoned.         
	Nehra, who was adjudged the Man of the Match for his three for 24, said he had been working hard for the last five-six months since his comeback from injury. I was struggling with the injury So, I worked really hard for past five-six months to get back into form, he said.         
	Rival Captain Daniel Vettori admitted that his batsmen couldnt put up a challenging total on the board. We should have got the 200-run mark Sachin, Dhoni and Raina showed how to bat on this track, he said.

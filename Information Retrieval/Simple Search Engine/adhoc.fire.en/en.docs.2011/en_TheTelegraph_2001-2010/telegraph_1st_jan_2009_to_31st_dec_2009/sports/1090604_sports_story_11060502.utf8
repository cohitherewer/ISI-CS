The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nielsen happy with progress
                                                   Nielsen happy with progress
                      
	London: Australia coach Tim Nielsen believes his side are gearing up well for the World Twenty20 after their impressive seven-wicket warm-up win against New Zealand here at the Oval.         
	After Mondays win, a bullish Nielsen told reporters: I feel we are building all the time. With Brett batting at No.10, we feel we bat all the way down. We showed today weve got seven or eight blokes who are frontline bowlers as well. And when we are fielding at our best, we are probably as good as anybody.         
	This win came hot on the heels of Mondays 38-run success against Bangladesh, and made Nielsen confident ahead of their tournament opener against the West Indies at the Oval here on Saturday.         
	Group C has been labelled the Group of Death as, unlike the three other pools, there are no minnows, with Australia taking on two rival Test sides in the West Indies and Sri Lanka. But Nielsen believes that will help his side, having seen his first game in charge of Australia end in the embarrassment of a five-wicket loss to Zimbabwe at the inaugural World Twenty20.         
	I agree weve got a tough group, but that has added a bit of edge to what we are doing. We know weve got to be up and going from Saturday, Nielsen said. The first game we played at the last World Twenty in 2007 was my first game as coach and we had the glorious result of a defeat to Zimbabwe. We are looking not to repeat that sort of form this time.         
	Nielsen was heartened by the form of the 27-year-old Johnson. Hes come off a month off and done some work in the gym. He was beaming last (Monday) night, he thought his rhythm was there and the ball was coming out fast without him trying hard, which is always a good indicator.         
	Nielsen added: A lot of people have spoken about the age of our team, but weve got the best skilled players in Australia playing at the moment and unless people are on their game, we are going to be hard to beat.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Proteas looking to topple India
                                                                                                                       7                                          Proteas looking to topple India
            A STAFF REPORTER            Jacques Kallis and South Africas coaching consultant Duncan Fletcher in Centurion on Tuesday                           
	Calcutta: South Africa will be looking to regain their No.1 ranking in Tests when they take on England in the first Test of their four-match series in Centurion on Wednesday.         
	The Proteas need to beat England by a 2-0 margin or better to reclaim the numero uno spot they had conceded to India after Mahendra Singh Dhonis men won the third Test against Sri Lanka in Mumbai to clinch the three-match series.         
	A 2-0 or 3-1 series win will put the hosts on a par with India but fractionally ahead when the ratings are calculated beyond the decimal point. A 4-0 whitewash will take Graeme Smiths boys to 127 ratings points.         
	However, it is England who will benefit more remarkably from a whitewash. If Andrew Strauss and Co. manage to blank the Proteas they would have leapfrogged the hosts when the ratings are calculated beyond the decimal point.         
	The Centurion Test will be Makhaya Ntinis 100th for South Africa and the pacer said he wanted to help his team oust India from the top spot in the ICC rankings.

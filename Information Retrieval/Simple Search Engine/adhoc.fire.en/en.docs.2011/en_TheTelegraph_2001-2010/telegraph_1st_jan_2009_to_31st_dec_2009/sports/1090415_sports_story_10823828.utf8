The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger for golf in Olympics
                                                     Tiger for golf in Olympics
                  Tiger Woods                     
	London: World number one Tiger Woods is one of 18 of the worlds leading golfers to back the International Golf Federations (IGF) bid to have the sport included in the 2016 Olympic Games.         
	Woods has written personally and sent a 32-page brochure outlining the bid to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) member for the United States.         
	Irelands Padraic Harrington, winner of two majors last year, Fijis Vijai Singh, Europes 2010 Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie and Spains Sergio Garcia, have also written to their respective IOC members to try and restore golf to the Olympic fold for the first time for more than 100 years.         
	As we have consistently stated from the outset of the bid process, it is imperative that the best players in the world support golfs Olympic effort, Peter Dawson, chief executive of The R amp;A and joint secretary of the IGF, said.         
	Dawson said in a statement this would give golf the best chance of being selected by the IOC to participate in the 2016 Olympic Games.         
	The IGFs Olympic committee, which represents golfs main organisations and tours, hopes to claim one of two spots for new sports available at the 2016 Games after golf missed out on the 2012 Games.         
	Dawson said last year that a strokeplay competition would be the proposed format for golf at the Games, with men and women taking part.         
	The last time Olympic medals were up for grabs in the sport was at the 1904 Games in St Louis.         
	Golf faces competition from baseball, karate, roller sports, rugby sevens, softball and squash with the IOCs final vote taking place in October when the host city will also be chosen. Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo are the contenders.           (REUTERS)

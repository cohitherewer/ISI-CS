The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chasing benchmarks set by Sachin: Ricky
                                                     Chasing benchmarks set by Sachin: Ricky
          
	Centurion: Australian skipper Ricky Ponting, only the third batsman to amass 12,000 runs in one-day cricket, says he is chasing the benchmarks set by Indian maestro Sachin Tendulkar.         
	Ponting, after scoring a match-winning unbeaten 111-run knock against England on Friday to take Australia to their second successive Champions Trophy final, paid tribute to Tendulkar, who is completing 20 years in international cricket this November.         
	The number of innings of his I have been able to sit back and watch, I think he is an amazing player. Look at his stats and records and its quite incredible for someone to have stayed in the game for 20 years, Ponting said.         
	He has set benchmarks for guys like me to chase him and get as close as we can. If I had to last 20 years, I would probably be batting in a wheelchair, he quipped.         
	Ponting is the first Australian and the third overall, after Tendulkar and Sri Lankas Sanath Jayasuriya, to score 12,000 runs in one-dayers. Tendulkar has played 159 Tests and scored 12,773 runs with 42 centuries and 53 half centuries at an average of 54.58 runs.         
	In one-dayers, he has played 430 matches and scored 16,903 runs with 44 hundreds and 91 fifties, averaging 44.48.         
	Ponting, on the other hand has played 136 Tests and scored 11,345 runs with 38 centuries and 48 half centuries, averaging 55.88.         
	In ODI, he has played 323 matches, scored 12,043 runs with 28 centuries and 70 fifties, averaging 43.32.

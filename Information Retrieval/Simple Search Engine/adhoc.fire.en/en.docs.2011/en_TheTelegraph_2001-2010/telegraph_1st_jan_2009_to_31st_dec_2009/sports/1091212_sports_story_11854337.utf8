	Mumbai/New Delhi: Delhi kept their quarter final hopes alive by notching up a comprehensive 10-wicket triumph over Maharashtra in their fifth Ranji Trophy Super League Group B match here Friday.         
	Their second successive win gave Delhi six points, taking their overall tally to 15, and Virat Kohlis side now needs to get three points from the Bengal match in their final group engagement, to be in the hunt for quarter finals.         
	Needing just 109 runs to win the match, Delhi romped home in just 17.1 overs with Virat and Mithun Manhas combining for a 112-run unbeaten opening stand.         
	In Mumbai, sixteen-year-old Aushik Srinivas was visiting Mumbai for the first time in his life and he made it memorable for himself on Friday by getting a red cherry autographed by none other than the maestro, Sachin Tendulkar.         
	The boy from Coimbatore picked up seven for 107 with his left-arm spin to rout Mumbai for 366 in their first innings and help his team, Tamil Nadu, snatch a lead of 135 runs on the fourth and final day of their super League match.

	London: Christopher Samba scored a last-gasp equaliser to earn Blackburn Rovers a 2-2 draw at home to Coventry City in the FA Cup fifth round on Saturday.         
	Rovers looked to be heading for defeat against their Championship (second division) opponents until defender Samba popped up to spare their blushes.         
	Fulham also survived a severe test against a side from the Championship, drawing 1-1 with Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium.         
	In the only all-Premier League clash of the day West Ham United drew 1-1 at home to Middlesbrough. Premier League side Hull City and second tier Sheffield United also drew 1-1.         
	Fulham survived a testing trip to south Wales. The Premier League side were outplayed for most of the game by their Championship (second division) opponents but took a fortunate lead just before the break when Swans skipper Garry Monk scored an own goal.         
	Swanseas Trinidadian striker Jason Scotland scored a superb equaliser after 52 minutes, turning in an instant to slam a low shot past Fulham keeper Mark Schwarzer and set up a replay.

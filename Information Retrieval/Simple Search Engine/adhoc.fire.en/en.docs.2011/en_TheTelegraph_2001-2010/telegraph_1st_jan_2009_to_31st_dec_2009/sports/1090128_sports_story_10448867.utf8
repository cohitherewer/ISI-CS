The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harbhajan: Kirsten, Dhoni inspired rise
                                                   Harbhajan: Kirsten, Dhoni inspired rise
                      
	Jalandhar: Harbhajan Singh Tuesday credited the Indian cricket teams meteoric rise in stature to Mahendra Singh Dhonis positive captaincy and coach Gary Kirstens calming influence on the dressing room.         
	You can see the results of the positive attitude of our captain. The Indian team won almost all tournaments last year under Dhonis captaincy, Harbhajan said.         
	Harabhajan also lauded Kirsten, saying the South African had played a vital role in making the dressing room a calm place even during tense match situations.         
	He is a great coach and the environment of dressing room now has also improved in a positive manner. Even in a very tense situation, all players feel light in the dressing room, he said.         
	The flamboyant off-spinner reckons India have almost become the top side in the world with their performances in recent times but the status would be officially theirs only if they beat New Zealand in March.         
	We are almost the No.1 team as we have already beaten world champions Australia and a strong team like South Africa and if we beat New Zealand, too, the Indian team will achieve the No.1 status in international cricket, he said.         
	India beat Australia 2-0 in a home Test series last year after drawing a three-match Test series 1-1 against South Africa in March-April.         
	Harbhajan has been forced out of the one-day International series against Sri Lanka starting Wednesday due to a hamstring injury. The off-spinner, who has been conferred a Padma Shree this year, said he was recovering well and would be fit in the next couple of weeks.         
	I was sent to South Africa for treatment by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and spent about 15 days under the special treatment and improved a lot. Doctors have advised me some exercises, and within a couple of weeks I will be fit to play, he said.

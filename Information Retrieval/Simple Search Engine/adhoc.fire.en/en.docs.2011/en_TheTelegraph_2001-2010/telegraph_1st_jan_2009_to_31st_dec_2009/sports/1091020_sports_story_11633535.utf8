The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis to lead till 2011 Cup
                                                     Younis to lead till 2011 Cup
    - Dont see any justification for removing him, says Butt; Afridi retained T20 skipper             OUR CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES            Younis Khan                                 
	Calcutta/Karachi: On a day when The Telegraph said that it would not come as a surprise if Younis Khans resignation is rejected, he was retained as the Pakistan captain for Tests and ODIs till the 2011 World Cup.         
	Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB)s decision brought an end to the uncertainty surrounding the captaincy.         
	PCB chairman Ejaz Butt told reporters that the Board had rejected Youniss resignation, and he would continue in that position, till the next World Cup.         
	It has been reported that Younis still enjoys the complete support of Butt, and the chairman proved the report was true, when he said on Monday in Lahore: I dont see any justification for removing him as captain. He has done a great job with the team and as long as he remains fit and in form, and the selectors keep on selecting him, he remains our captain till the next World Cup.         
	Butt also said the Board has decided to retain Shahid Afridi as captain of the Twenty20 side till the World Twenty20 in the West Indies next year.         
	The announcements squashed the hopes of the anti-Younis lobby in Pakistan cricket, which had launched a campaign against the 31-year old.         
	Younis had resigned last week, after a hearing of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Sports, protesting the allegations made by the committee chairman Jamshed Dasti. Dasti had accused Younis and his teammates of under-performance in the Champions Trophy. Pakistan lost in the semi-finals to New Zealand, with Younis leading the side despite having a fractured finger.         
	Butt said when PCB had named Younis in January this year, the Board had not discussed any term for his captaincy. But now, obviously, he wants security like any other captain. So he will remain our captain till the next World Cup. He is doing a good job and that is his right, he remarked.         
	Butt defended Youniss resignation in the face of the allegations, saying it was a natural reaction by the senior player. He reacted after so many things happened, and I would have done the same had I been in his place, Butt said.         
	Sources said the PCB has asked its governing council members not to make irresponsible statements in the media, the direction coming in the wake of Muhammad Ali Shahs outburst against the umpires after Pakistans Champions Trophy exit. Shah, a member of the council, had alleged that India had influenced umpires to take decisions against Pakistan. Butt told members that there is a proper way to raise issues and no official should say anything which amounts to violation of the International Cricket Councils Code of Conduct.         
	Meanwhile, former Pakistan captain and a one-time chief executive officer of the PCB, Ramiz Raja, has hailed the Boards decision.         
	I think, the chairman of the PCB has given a lot of thought to this matter and taken a very judicious decision, which is good for Pakistan cricket, Ramiz said. Im happy that a period of uncertainty in our cricket has been ended that started with Youniss resignation.         
	It was necessary to continue with Younis as captain to ensure the rebuilding process of the team was not derailed, and we keep on improving as a team, he added.

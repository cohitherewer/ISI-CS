The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I still have a lot to work on, says Sania Mirza
                                                   I still have a lot to work on, says Sania Mirza
                      
	Melbourne: Sania Mirza crashed out of the Australian Open singles event after being hammered in straight sets by Russian 10th seed Nadia Petrova in the second round here on Wednesday.         
	World No.11 Petrova took just 70 minutes to beat the 22-year-old Sania 6-3, 6-2, also bringing down the curtains on Indias singles challenge in the process.         
	Although disappointed with the loss, Sania said she was relieved to be back on the court after being out for months due to a career-threatening wrist injury.         
	Im just happy to be back and doing what I love doing, playing tennis and competing. There was a big crowd out there and I havent played like that for six months, she said.         
	Of course Im disappointed at losing but I will try and take positives from this. I will try and get into the top 30, of course, but the last five or six months have taught me to live for the moment so I dont want to get ahead of myself.         
	Sania and Petrova had faced each other twice earlier and the record stood 1-1 before Wednesday.         
	Petrova, whose best at the Australian Open has been reaching the quarter finals in 2006, broke Sania in the fourth game of the first set to take a 3-1 lead.         
	Petrova consolidated the lead to 4-1 by holding her serve in the next game and the set went on serve from there in favour of the Russian.         
	Sania did well to save another break and edge closer to the Russian at 3-5 but Petrova managed to take the first set after an unforced error by Sania.         
	Sania also had her share of chances and her first breakpoint  earned through a beautiful service return winner  came in the third game of the first set but Petrova served well to save the game.         
	Sania engaged her opponent in long rallies, and showed that she had a plan to set up points, but lacked in execution.         
	When youre playing the world number 10 you expect her to raise her game under pressure and that is exactly what she did, Sania said later. I was a break up and I played a decent match but I still have a lot to work on.         
	The second set saw Petrova assert her authority and a combination of aces, points won at the net and forehand winners saw her easily clinch the match.         
	There are no excuses. I could blame it on a lack of match practice time, or on playing the world number 10. I had a sore stomach as well, she said.

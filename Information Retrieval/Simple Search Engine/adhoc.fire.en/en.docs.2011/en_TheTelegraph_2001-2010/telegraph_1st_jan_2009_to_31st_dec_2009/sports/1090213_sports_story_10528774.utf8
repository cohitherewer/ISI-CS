The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Argentina have it easy vs France
                                                   Argentina have it easy vs France
                      
	London: Diego Maradonas Argentina were impressive 2-0 winners in France on Wednesday as two of world footballs heavyweights squared up for a friendly in Marseille.         
	Goals from Jonas Gutierrez and Lionel Messi gave Maradona his second victory in two games since taking charge of the national team in November after French fans had chanted his name before kickoff.         
	There was a shock 1-0 defeat for Germany at home to Norway while next years World Cup hosts South Africa were given another reminder of how much work they need to do in the next 18 months when they lost 2-0 at home to Chile.         
	In one of the few matches with points at stake Ireland boosted their chances of qualifying for the 2010 World Cup when record scorer Robbie Keane struck twice, including a penalty, as his side came back to beat Georgia 2-1 in Dublin.         
	Giovanni Trapattonis side are now level with Italy on 10 points at the top of Group 8.         
	Albania wasted a great chance to go top of their World Cup qualifying group, drawing 0-0 with Malta.         
	A second-half Christian Grindheim goal handed Norway victory over a lacklustre Germany in a friendly in Dusseldorf. The visitors grabbed a deserved winner in the 63rd minute when Morten Gamst Pedersen crossed for Grindheim to tap in.         
	In other friendly fixtures, The Netherlands were held to a 1-1 draw by Tunisia while Brazil-born striker Eduardo da Silva made an impressive return to top-level action, setting up the winner as Croatia beat Romania 2-1.

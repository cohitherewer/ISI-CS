The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vacation on the minds of Spaniards
                                                   Vacation on the minds of Spaniards
                      
	Bloemfontein: Vacation, not a third-place game at the Confederations Cup, was on the minds of Spains players on Thursday.         
	Were not playing in the final and I dont know why a third-place game is played, really, Spain defender Joan Capdevila said. But we have to play it.         
	Spain trained in Bloemfontein on Thursday and were expected to travel to Rustenburg on Friday to prepare for Sundays match at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium.         
	Now the task for coach Vicente del Bosque will be about keeping Spain motivated for another four days with nearly all players coming off a long season.         
	You have to play, its staged this way. Whenever you have a chance to reach the final and you dont, its hard, Spain defender Carles Puyol said. Were motivated to finish third but were also motivated to go on vacation.         
	Puyol is one of four Barcelona players that played two games per week nearly all season on the way to becoming the first Spanish club to win the league, domestic cup and Champions League in the same season.

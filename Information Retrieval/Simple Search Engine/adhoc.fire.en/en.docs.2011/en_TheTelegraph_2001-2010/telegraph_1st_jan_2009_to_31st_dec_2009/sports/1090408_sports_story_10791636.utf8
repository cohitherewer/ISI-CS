The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Porto hold United 2-2
                                                   Porto hold United 2-2
                      
	London: Marianos 88th minute equaliser enabled FC Porto to hold Manchester United 2-2 in the Champions League quarter final first leg match at Old Trafford on Tuesday.   
	The defending champions were all set for a win after Tevez, off a Gary Neville throw, turned the ball into the roof of the net to make it 2-1. But then subsitute Mariano controlled Lisandros cross and steered a shot past Van der Sar.         
	In another match, Arsenal rallied to hold hosts Villarreal 1-1. After Marcos Senna put the home team ahead in the 10th minute, Emmanuel Adebayor equalised in the 66th minute. Porto took a shock lead in the fourth minute and it all stemmed from a poor clearance by Jonny Evans. The defender turned the ball out to Cristian Rodriguez, who cut into the box on his left-foot and curled a fine shot beyond the outstretched hand of Edwin van der Sar into the bottom corner.         
	United equalised in the 15th minute thanks to a horrendous error from Bruno Alves. Alves didnt bother looking over his shoulder as his backpass was intercepted by Rooney and he lifted the shot over the Porto goalkeeper Helton.         
	Hulk, the Brazilian striker who had attracted attention in Spain after a brilliant display in the first leg of the last-16 tie against Atletico Madrid, posed quite a few problems for the Manchester United defence. He picked out Evans and used his strength to unnerve Uniteds young defender.         
	Six minutes before first half, Paul Scholess wonderful 50-yard pass picked out Ronaldo on the right edge of the box. The Portuguese winger nodded the ball into the path of the onrushing Darren Fletcher whose right-footed drive took a deflection and spun out for a corner.         
	Meanwhile, in Villarreal, Arsenal trailed the Yellow Submarine 0-1. The Gunners gave Senna too much space, and paid the ultimate price. As soon as Giuseppe Rossi teed up the midfielder, one could hear the buzz around the stadium. And Senna didnt disappoint as he fired a sweet strike past Almunia and into the top corner.         
	In the first-half injury time, Arsenal found the equaliser but the goal was turned down. Cesc Fabregas took a free-kick quickly which caught everyone off-guard and found the back of the net. But referee Tom Henning Overdo was unimpressed and disallowed the goal.

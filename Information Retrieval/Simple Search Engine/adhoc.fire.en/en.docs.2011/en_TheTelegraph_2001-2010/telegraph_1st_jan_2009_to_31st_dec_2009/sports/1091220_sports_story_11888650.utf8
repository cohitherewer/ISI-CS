The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | After 2-match ban, whip is likely to be cracked
                                                                                                                       7                                        After 2-match ban, whip is likely to be cracked
    - To avoid more frustration, Dhoni doesnt travel with team           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni                                 
	Nagpur: Having been tripped by his own bowlers, Mahendra Singh Dhoni had no choice but to reflect on what could and should have been.         
	The acute disappointment came through when the Team India captain spoke to The Telegraph at the Pride Hotel here, on Saturday afternoon, some hours after news of his two-ODI ban became public.         
	Senior pro Virender Sehwag has been named the stand-in captain. Its a role he has performed before, in the Rahul Dravid era and earlier this year, in New Zealand.         
	I cant comment on the ban, Dhoni said, his tone not concealing anything.         
	Asked why hed decided against accompanying the team to Bhubaneshwar (for the third match, in Cuttack) and to Calcutta, after that, Dhoni replied: Because Id probably feel more frustrated...         
	Dhoni planned to take an evening flight to Mumbai and, then, head home to Ranchi for a break which is always welcome. Its just that the circumstances this time arent pleasing.         
	According to sources, Match Referee Jeff Crowe (a former New Zealand captain) handed out the punishment orally after Fridays ODI in neighbouring Jamtha.         
	The written communication came later.         
	Dhoni got booked under the amended Code of Conduct, which has been in operation from October. A repeat of a serious over-rate offence, in the next 12 months, would lead to a much harsher punishment.         
	Clearly, Dhoni is now going to be under more pressure.         
	The Indians were okay till the 42nd over, but bowled no more than eight in the last hour... After all the allowances, the Match Referee still found India very short... Under the provisions of the Code of Conduct, Dhoni had to be banned, is how one source put it.         
	Another pointed out that the punishment had nothing to do with a breach of discipline and, so, the Board of Control for Cricket in India and Dhoni didnt really have grounds to appeal.         
	There was also talk that Dhoni had actually admitted hed been guilty of not pushing his bowlers.         
	Unlike a breach of discipline which may be disputed, this violation of the Code of Conduct was in black and white... The Match Referee did make allowances, but his hands were tied, the other source maintained.         
	Dhoni, one learns, was reminded by the on-field umpires that his bowlers were falling behind, but the close finish (ending in a three-wicket win for Sri Lanka) didnt exactly leave enough room for the captain to manoeuvre.         
	Whatever the strategy, thanks to Tillekaratne Dilshan, it went for a six. With time at a premium, coach Gary Kirsten has to quickly review plans.         
	Thats not all.         
	The day isnt far off when Dhoni will, perhaps, tell his bowlers that only those whore able to complete an over in four minutes would make the XI.         
	Expect the whip, then, to be cracked.         
	Meanwhile, Sourav Ganguly, who often got into trouble on similar grounds, had this to say: One way of looking at it is that Dhoni is getting some rest!         
	But dont the bowlers and the others get away lightly, as fines arent much of a punishment?         
	Sourav, whod captained Team India from March 2000 to September 2005, answered: But thats why youre the captain. Youve got to ensure that the over-rate is met.         
	Point, indeed.         
	The rest of the playing XI have each been docked 40 per cent of their match fees.

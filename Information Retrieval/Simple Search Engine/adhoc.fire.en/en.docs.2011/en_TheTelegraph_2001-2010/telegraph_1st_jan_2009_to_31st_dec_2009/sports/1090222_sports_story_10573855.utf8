                                                   Anand slips to tied 3rd
                      
	Linares: World champion Viswanathan Anand frittered away a superior position as he went down to Armenian Grandmaster Levon Aronian and slipped to the joint third spot after the second round of the 22nd Linares chess meet.         
	Anand started with a brilliant victory against Teimour Radjabov in the opener and had a big advantage before he suddenly missed some simple tactics and lost without further resistance.         
	Aronian emerged as the new leader along with Alexander Grischuk of Russia, who tamed Wang Yue of China. The other two games of the second round were drawn. Anand shares the third spot with Vassily Ivanchuk, Magnus Carlson and Lenier Dominguez .

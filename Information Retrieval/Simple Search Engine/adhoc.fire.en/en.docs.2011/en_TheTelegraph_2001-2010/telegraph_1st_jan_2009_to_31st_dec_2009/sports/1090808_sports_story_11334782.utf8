                                                     Bhutia: Barca camp perfect
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bhaichung Bhutia                           
	New Delhi: The month-long training camp in Barcelona with the national team was one of the greatest experiences of Bhaichung Bhutias life.         
	Talking about his stint at Nou Camp in FC Barcelona, the Indian captain said: It was like visiting a palace and watching how the king lives there. Rarely have I seen such facilities anywhere in the world.         
	I cannot really describe my feelings, said Bhaichung. The atmosphere there was so perfect for top-class training that it was a big boost for the whole team. All of us are now ready for the Nehru Cup campaign, he added.         
	Bhaichung felt that the four practice matches that India played in Barcelona would go a long way in helping the team to put up a better show in the Nehru Cup. All the four opponents were tough and that we did not lose any of the four outings would be a morale booster.         
	Please dont dismiss our opponents as Division Three teams. One of them is already in line for the championships. Their players were not only physically fit but extremely skilful, Bhaichung added.         
	The four matches, according to Bhaichung, helped the team management in building the side for the Nehru Cup. In the first two matches, all the players were fielded. In the next two outings, Bob (Houghton) ensured the players who would form the core group of the side received more opportunities.         
	The chances came handy as players like (goalkeeper) Subrata Paul and (striker) Sunil Chetri, who were a bit out of shape for different reasons, found their bearings. I am sure these players would once again prove to be our assets in the Nehru Cup, said the India captain.         
	Among the newcomers, Jagpreet Singh of JCT impressed him most. It was his first tour with the national team, but we all felt he would go a long way, said India s most experienced footballer.         
	Bhaichung was happy that scouts from different European clubs came calling to Nou Camp to watch the Indian footballers.         
	Its an encouraging development, remarked the ace striker. With a high-profile coach like Bob being around, it did arouse some interest among the European clubs there. I believe some people from a Belgian club watched our training for a few days. Agents of a Scottish club also had a close look at Chetri early this week.         
	Bhaichung, however, was disappointed that he had still not been released by Mohun Bagan.         
	Indian football will not prosper if players are harassed in this manner. If Mohun Bagan are allowed to get away by doing this to me, it will set a really bad precedent, he said.

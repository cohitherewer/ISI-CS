The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Villa stars in Valencia win 
                                                                                                                                   Villa stars in Valencia win 
                      
	Madrid: Frederic Kanoute struck within four minutes of coming off the bench to snatch a 3-2 comeback victory for Sevilla at home to Villarreal on Sunday and maintain their hold on third place in La Liga.         
	Sevilla were under pressure after Valencia beat promoted Real Zaragoza 3-1 earlier on Sunday to climb above the Andalusians but Mali striker Kanoute rose unmarked to nod in Adriano Correias cross for a 66th-minute winner.         
	Valencia striker David Villa netted his eighth of the season against Zaragoza to move clear in the scoring charts ahead of Barcelonas Lionel Messi and Zlatan Ibrahimovic on seven.         
	Champions Barca top the standings with 26 points from 10 matches, with Real Madrid on 25 and Sevilla on 22. Valencia are a point behind Sevilla in fourth while Villarreal are down in 16th place with just nine.         
	Brazil striker Luis Fabiano gave Sevilla the lead at the Sanchez Pizjuan with the first of his two goals after eight minutes before Robert Pires combined with Bruno Soriano to equalise for Villarreal just before the half hour.         
	In Valencia, Villas Spain teammates Juan Mata and David Silva combined to put the home side ahead after 17 minutes at the Mestalla when Silvas pass sent Mata clear and he finished coolly past Javier Lopez Vallejo.         
	In Sundays earlier matches, Athletic Bilbao won 2-0 at Racing Santander and Sporting Gijon beat visiting Espanyol 1-0 thanks to a third-minute goal from Croatia striker Mate Bilic.         
	Osasuna, who held Barca to a 1-1 draw last weekend, lost 2-0 at Hugo Sanchezs Almeria and Xerez climbed back off the bottom above Malaga with a 0-0 draw at Real Valladolid.

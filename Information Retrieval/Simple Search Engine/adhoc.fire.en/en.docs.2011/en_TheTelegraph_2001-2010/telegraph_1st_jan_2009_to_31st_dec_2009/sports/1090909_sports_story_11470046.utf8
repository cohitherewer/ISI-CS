The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Srikkanth taken by surprise
                                                     Srikkanth taken by surprise
    - Sehwag comment Lets not make it a big issue, says chief selector           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Srikkanth                                 
	Calcutta: Senior pro Virender Sehwags I dont want to be a captain, I have already told the selectors that comment, in a TV interview on Monday, has been greeted with surprise by chief selector Krishnamachari Srikkanth.         
	I know nothing about it and, so, how can I react? Lets not make it a big issue, Srikkanth, a former India captain, told The Telegraph on Tuesday.         
	The selector from North (Sehwags Zone), Yashpal Sharma, also maintained he knew nothing. If Sehwag indeed has said anything on those lines, he would have conveyed that to our chairman (Srikkanth)... Thats the protocol...         
	One other selector took exactly the same line. The remaining two couldnt be contacted.         
	Reinstated as vice-captain last November, two years after losing that position, Sehwag is currently recovering from shoulder surgery and, therefore, out of Team India.         
	June onwards, the vice-captaincy has been with the dashing Yuvraj Singh. He has, specifically, been Mahendra Singh Dhonis deputy from the second edition of the World T20, held in England.                   Sehwag      
	For the record, Dhoni has been the captain in all three forms from November 2008, after Anil Kumbles retirement during the home Test series against Australia.         
	Sehwag had, in the TV interview, also stated: I have said that a new player be made vice-captain and groomed to be the captain... I (just) want to continue scoring runs and keep winning matches...         
	If that, indeed, is Sehwags state of mind, its to be seen whether he will continue to captain Delhi in domestic cricket.         
	Not that players who are quite reserved by nature cant captain, but Sehwag is seen as somebody who is particularly insular. That his family (wife and infant son) travels with him, and needs attention, has probably made him more of a private person.         
	In todays world, the off-the-field demands on captains are huge and some do feel burdened. The enjoyment goes if family life suffers beyond a point.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tendulkar vs Warne once again
                                                   Tendulkar vs Warne once again
                      
	Durban: Rajasthan Royals will hope to resuscitate their title defence while Mumbai Indians would seek to maintain their winning momentum when they cross swords in the Indian Premier League (IPL) here on Tuesday.         
	The contest will once again see Shane Warne pitting his wits against Sachin Tendulkar who used to win their duels hands down when they were playing for their respective countries.         
	Led by the charismatic Shane Warne, the Royals started their IPL campaign on a disastrous note when last years laggards Royal Challengers Bangalore humiliated them by 75 runs on the opening day of the tournament.         
	Although the Rajasthan Royals bowling department looked strong with Dimitri Mascarenhas, Munaf Patel and Warne leading from the front, their batting looked in complete disarray.         
	Rajasthan Royals, however, can take heart from history. Last year too, Warnes men lost their IPL opener before going on to win the title. Warne felt let down by his batsmen but the spin legend sounded optimistic about bouncing back strongly.         
	It is pretty disappointing. As champions we wanted to impose ourselves. We were exceptional in bowling and fielding but batsmen could not do well. Shot selection was really bad. I think the top 3-4 batsmen could have shown sensibility and played sensible shots. But I promise to come back strong, he said after the defeat against Bangalore.         
	On the other hand, the Sachin Tendulkar-led Mumbai Indians will be hoping to maintain a clean slate on Tuesday and they have good reasons to be confident ahead of the tie.         
	Tendulkar himself is in ominous form and led the team from the front in Saturdays win over the Chennai Super Kings.         
	Explosive Sanath Jayasuriya and talented Shikhar Dhawan looked good with the bat. Abhishek Nayar has already proved that he doesnt care for the opponents reputation and if J.P. Duminy finds his form, it would spell doom for the Royals. Like their batsmen, Mumbai Indian bowlers, led by Zaheer Khan, looked impressive. Apart from Zaheer, Lasith Malinga is still a dangerous customer to deal with, while Harbhajan Singh proved he could spin a web around any batting order.

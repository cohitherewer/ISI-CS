The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Real run riot against Betis 
                                                   Real run riot against Betis 
                            
	Madrid: Bottom club Espanyol stunned leaders Barcelona with a 2-1 victory at the Nou Camp while chasing Real Madrid ran riot with a 6-1 home win over Real Betis in the Primera Liga on Saturday.         
	Ten-man Barca slipped to only their second defeat of the campaign and saw their lead, which stood at 12 points just over a week ago, reduced to seven.         
	Espanyols Ivan de la Pena, who once played for Barca, made the most of Seydou Keitas first-half dismissal, scoring twice after the break in the Catalan derby.         
	Yaya Toure pulled one back just past the hour but it was not enough to prevent champions Real edging even closer with their ninth successive victory.         
	Klaas jan Huntelaar and Raul helped themselves to two goals each while Gonzalo Higuain and Sergio Ramos weighed in with one apiece as Real went in 6-1 up at halftime at the Bernabeu.         
	No one said this would be easy, Guardiola said. But we are still in a good position and tomorrow we will pick ourselves up and well get everyone back on track.         
	Barca are on 60 points and Real have 53 while third-placed Sevilla climbed on to 44 after Jesus Navas grabbed a late winner for a 1-0 win at home to Atletico Madrid.         
	Villarreal are up to fourth with 41 points after a 2-1 home win over Sporting Gijon.         
	Spanish media spent the week talking about the possibility of Real staging a comeback to win the league after Barca dropped two points against Betis last week, and Pep Guardiolas team looked nervous from the outset versus Espanyol.         
	The stop-start nature of the game, and an increasingly heated atmosphere, led to Keita getting a red card for a late challenge after 38 minutes.         
	De la Pena was left unmarked to head home at the back post after 50 minutes and four minutes later Victor Valdes was put under pressure with the ball at his feet and passed straight to De la Pena, who lobbed into the open net.         
	Toures fine volley after a freekick in the 62nd was the best Barca could muster in reply. It was Espanyols first win in 15 attempts in the league.         
	Some woeful Betis defending gifted their hosts a flying start at the Bernabeu.         
	Higuain rounded goalkeeper Ricardo Pereira for the opener after seven minutes, and Huntelaar bagged the second soon after when Pereira weakly pushed a cross straight to him.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Another chance for Owen
                                                   Another chance for Owen
            THE TIMES, LONDON                      
	Michael Owen will be given what could be a final opportunity to resurrect his England career when Newcastle United face Blackburn Rovers in the Barclays Premier League Saturday. Fabio Capello, the England manager, will be at Ewood Park to watch Owen with a view to recalling the countrys leading available goalscorer to his squad for next months friendly international against Spain.         
	Owen has not played for England since the 1-0 friendly defeat by France last March, with Capellos decision to leave him out of the past eight squads leading many to conclude that his international career was over, despite a record of 40 goals in 89 appearances.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India to face SA 
                                                   India to face SA 
                      
	New Delhi: India will have to beat South Africa to re-claim a berth in the Davis Cup World group in an away play-off tie from September 18-20.         
	The International Tennis Federation (ITF) on Tuesday released the draw, which pits the two teams against each other.         
	India advanced to the play-off stage after Australia forfeited the Asia/Oceania Group I tie, which were to be held from May 8-10 in Chennai, due to security concerns.         
	South Africa came through after whitewashing Belarus 5-0 in their Europe/Africa group tie.         
	India had earlier met South Africa on two occasions in the Davis Cup, but unfortunately lost both times.         
	The first instance was in 1967 when India was routed 0-5 in Spain.         
	The last time they met was in 1994 at Jaipur, the tie that India again lost 2-3.         
	The winning team will advance to the 2010 World Group, while the losers will start next year in their respective Group I zonal event.         
	Reacting to the draw, Somdev Dev Varman said: Its a good draw for us.           (PTI)

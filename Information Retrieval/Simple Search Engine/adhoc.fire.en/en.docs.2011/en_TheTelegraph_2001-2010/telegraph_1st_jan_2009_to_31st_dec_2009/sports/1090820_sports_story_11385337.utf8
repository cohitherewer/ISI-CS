	England are destined to beat Australia at the Oval this week to regain the Ashes  and here is the proof.           U2 played at Wembley Stadium this week. The last time they graced the venue, on August 23, 1997, England were wrapping up a 23-run win over Australia at the Oval.  Usain Bolt has broken the 100m world record in Berlin. The last time the sprint record was broken here, in 1956, was when Willie Williams of the US ran 10.1 seconds. In the same week, Jim Laker took 19 wickets at Old Trafford to ensure England would retain the Ashes.  This month has seen huge demonstrations in Iran as a result of the disputed presidential election. Political unrest in Iran has been an encouraging sign for Englands Ashes chances.  This week sees the release of Quentin Tarantinos new film, Inglourious Basterds, which is loosely based on an Italian film of the same name. That film last received a cinema release in 1981  another of Englands Ashes-winning years.  The Stone Roses are back in the album charts with a re-release of their seminal self-titled debut album. The last time the album hit the top 40 was in 2005, when England famously regained the Ashes.  Until the start of this series, England have won every single home Test they have played while Michael Jackson is top of the album charts.The Essential Michael Jackson is sitting on top of the charts at the moment. Unfortunately, it was there at Headingley as well.      THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

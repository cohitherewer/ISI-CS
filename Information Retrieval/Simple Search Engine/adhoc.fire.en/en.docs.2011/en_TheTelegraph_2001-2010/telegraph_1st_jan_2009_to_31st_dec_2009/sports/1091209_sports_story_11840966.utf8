The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dalmiya amp; Modi discuss much more than the IPL
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dalmiya amp; Modi discuss much more than the IPL
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Lalit Modi and Jagmohan Dalmiya at the Eden on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Its not only in politics that there are neither permanent friends nor permanent enemies. Holds true for the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), too.         
	Some, of course, may point out that the BCCI is itself much like a political akhada.         
	Four years after helping end Jagmohan Dalmiyas control over the BCCI  and three after being a party to his expulsion (shortlived, as it turned out)  Lalit Modi was actually breaking bread with the one-time czar.         
	Not on neutral ground, but on Dalmiyas turf.         
	Officially, Tuesdays meeting between Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) officials headed by president Dalmiya and Modi, the Indian Premier League (IPL) chairman-commissioner, was to discuss matters related to the T20 tournaments third edition, next year.         
	The Eden is the Kolkata Knight Riders home venue.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Dalmiya and Modi found time for a one-on-one. That interaction wouldve had everything to do with the goings-on in the BCCI, particularly looking to next years AGM, when president Shashank Manohars successor will be identified.         
	The BCCI secretary, N.Srinivasan, is Manohars choice. One learns, though, that some even within the ruling group are opposed to his elevation.         
	Its no secret that Modi doesnt really get along with Srinivasan and, so, the Dalmiya-Modi meeting is bound to keep him and his men on their toes.         
	At the very least, certainly.         
	Modi remains out of the Rajasthan Cricket Association, a body he once headed, but continues as a vice-president (Central) of the BCCI. Dalmiyas so-called allies ditched him in his battle against Sharad Pawar, but he still holds two votes  CAB and the National Cricket Club.         
	In a photo-finish, two votes would count for plenty.         
	As of now, owing to the constitutional requirements, Srinivasan is comfortably placed. But, then, its unlikely that somebody like Modi would give a walkover.         
	Dalmiya cant stand Srinivasan either.         
	Modi, it may be recalled, had been the very aggressive face of Pawars campaign (in 2005) and the Union minister couldnt have beaten Dalmiya nominee Ranbir Singh Mahendra without the moves plotted and executed by him.         
	Given the bitterness, few wouldve imagined that Dalmiya and Modi would, one day, be comfortable in each others company and share a platform.         
	Clearly, many find it strange that Modi hasnt been able to swing the last two elections in the state body his way, but other issues have been at play in Rajasthan.         
	Till Tuesday, Dalmiya and Modi had never got along when, in fact, they have a few things in common. Both are doers and both have the ability to raise millions.         
	Dalmiya (a former International Cricket Council president, as well) proved that for over a decade; Modi is a recent starter, but has become an instant headline-maker.         
	Incidentally, Modi is on excellent terms with an ex-BCCI president, who still carries clout. Then, thanks to the IPL and its lavish hospitality, he has got others with influence eating out of his palms.         
	The BCCIs next AGM is nine months away, but the next couple of months may show whats to be expected. And, perhaps, we should look out for more Dalmiya-Modi meetings.

            A STAFF REPORTER            Man of the Match A. Jyothi Kumar on Saturday                           
	Calcutta: Goals from A. Jyothi Kumar and Mike Okoro gave Mohammedan Sporting a much-needed shot in the arm in their battle for survival in the I-League on Saturday.         
	The 2-0 victory against JCT, coming as it did after five matches, sees them improve their standing by a spot to be No.9 with 13 points from 14 matches.         
	JCT tried to offer a fight in the first 30 minutes, but there was no stopping Mohammedan Sporting thereafter.         
	After a barren first half, Mohammedan Sporting started the second session on a promising note. Jyothis shot narrowly missed the target after Mike Okoros long ranger had rebounded off a defender.         
	Mohammedan Sporting finally managed to open the scoring in the 72nd minute. Substitute Suraj Mondal ran down the right, leaving behind a couple of defenders on the way, before sending a measured cross for Jyothi to slot home.         
	Not satisfied with the lone goal, Mohammedan Sporting intensified their attacks. Jyothi was once again in the thick of action. JCTs Julius Akpele brought him down inside the penalty box from behind. Quite expectedly, the referee pointed to the dreaded spot and Okoros powerful shot gave the goalie no chance.         
	Mohammedan Sporting next play Mohun Bagan on February 15.

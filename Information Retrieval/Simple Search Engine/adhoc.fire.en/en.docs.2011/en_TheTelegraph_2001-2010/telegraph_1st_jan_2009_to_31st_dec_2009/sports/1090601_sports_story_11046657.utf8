The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal in group of death
                                                   Bengal in group of death
                      
	Chennai: Twenty nine-time champions Bengal will face an uphill task in the quarter finals as they were clubbed with title-holders Punjab, Manipur and hosts Tamil Nadu in Group A of the 63rd National Football Championship for the Santosh Trophy.         
	Bengal play their first quarter final league match against Tamil Nadu on Tuesday.         
	Services, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Goa form the Group B. On Wednesday, Services will lock horns with Maharashtra while Karnataka will meet Goa.                     
	Tamil Nadu, former champions Goa and Manipur booked quarter final berths with easy wins while Maharashtra barely made the grade, here on Sunday.         
	Tamil Nadu rode on the goals scored by Muthu, Riju and Kulothungan to thump Haryana 5-0 at the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium here.         
	Meanwhile, in another pre-quarter final match at Tiruchirapally, Goa blanked Mizoram 3-0, by courtesy Joaquim Abranches (44th) and Marcus Mascarenhas (58th and 63rd).         
	At Thiruvallore, Manipur beat Railways 3-1, while Maharashtra edged past Kerala by a solitary goal in a close contest in Coimbatore.         
	The Railwaymen headed by Mehtab Hussain, who plays for East Bengal in the I-league, were not impressive on Sunday. Manipur pressed hard to score through Subhash Singh in the 19th minute and increased the lead through their star right winger Reisangi Vasum of the Churchill Brothers.         
	Vasum scored a brace, finding the net in the 39th and 72nd minute.         
	Nalender Chakravorthy converted a penalty kick to score for the Railways in the 81st minute.         
	On the other hand, Maharashtra depended on Kuttimani Sampathkumars quick reflexes to score in the 83rd minute.       (PTI)

                                                   Churchill have upper hand vs Sporting
                      
	Margao: A battle for supremacy is on the cards as Churchill Brothers take on Sporting Clube de Goa in the 15th round of the ONGC I-League at the Nehru Stadium here Sunday.         
	Churchill Brothers, who beat Sporting 3-0 in the first leg, are high on confidence, as all their players are fit and raring to go.         
	Its a crucial match as a win tomorrow (Sunday) will see us overtaking Sporting to second place, behind table toppers Mohun Bagan, stated Denzil Ferrao, manager Churchill Brothers.         
	Sporting, who led the table in the first leg, failed to maintain their supremacy after they lost to Mohan Bagan. The Calcutta club are leading the table with 30 points from 14 matches.         
	The loss against Bagan prompted the Sporting management to replace coach Viswas Gaonkar with Clifford Chukwama in a bid to arrest the slide.         
	Sporting Clube have three of their regular players unavailable Sunday.         
	Defender Luciano Sabrosa and Harmanjot Khabra are nursing injuries. While Wilton Gomes is out with a double booking.           (PTI)

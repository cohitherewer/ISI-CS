	Dubai: Israeli doubles specialist Andy Ram said he had achieved something big at the Dubai Championships on Wednesday even though he lost his first-round match 3-6, 6-3, 8-10 to Russias Marat Safin and David Ferrer of Spain.         
	Prakash Amritraj and partner Aisam-ul Haq Qureshi of Pakistan went down 6-7 (4-7), 5-7 to Martin Damm and Robert Lindstedt in a doubles first-round match.         
	Earlier, on Tuesday, second seed Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles sailed into the quarter finals after an easy 6-3, 6-1 win over UAEs Hamoud Abbas and Mahmoud-Naden Al Baloushi, as reported in Wednesdays Late City edition.         
	The Indo-Bahamian pair hardly broke sweat in their win against the wild card entrants. They will next take on Rik de Voest of South Africa and Dmitry Tursunov of Russia.         
	The United Arab Emirates gave Ram a special permit to compete at the tournament after receiving global condemnation for blocking the entry of fellow Israeli Shahar Peer last week for the womens event.         
	Let me tell you that it was obviously something big, history here, whats been done, the first Israeli coming to play sport in Dubai, Ram told reporters after he and Kevin Ullyett lost on a remote and heavily secured side court.         
	I fought for something really, really big and coming here was something big, because it showed that we should not involve sports with politics, he added.         
	Playing against Safin and Ferrer, Ram made his debut on court under tight security. Spectators and media were prevented from entering the arena until just before the start of the match.

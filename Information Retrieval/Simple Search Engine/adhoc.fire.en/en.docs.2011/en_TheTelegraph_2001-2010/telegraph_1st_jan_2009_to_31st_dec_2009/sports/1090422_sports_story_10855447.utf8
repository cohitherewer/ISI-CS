The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United to go full strength
                                                     United to go full strength
                  Cristiano Ronaldo                     
	London: Manchester Uniteds fans and players are hoping the same team selection that contributed to an FA Cup semi-final defeat at the weekend can now help a sudden recovery in the Premier League against Portsmouth on Wednesday.         
	Although United lost a penalty shootout to Everton on Sunday, that was only after a team mostly composed of reserves laboured to a 0-0 draw with a team five places lower in the Premier League.         
	A much stronger side will be on show at Old Trafford, with the defending champions relying on those players being unencumbered by the depressing cup defeat that ended hopes of an unprecedented five trophies in a season.         
	We must take it and recover for the next game, said defender Nemanja Vidic, one of just two regulars to start against Everton.         
	We need to be focused. It helps that some players were rested. They are going to be fresh and I hope we have a good game at Old Trafford.         
	Manager Alex Ferguson could be without the injured Michael Carrick, but will be able to recall Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Darren Fletcher after leaving them out of his squad at the weekend.         
	United may also get lucky after Portsmouth effectively secured their Premier League status for next season by beating Bolton 1-0 at the weekend. The result means the game doesnt have much riding on it for Pompey, who are six points clear of the relegation zone with six rounds remaining.         
	Meanwhile, Manchester City forward Craig Bellamy is likely to miss the rest of the season with a knee injury that has forced him out of the last three games. City manager Mark Hughes said on Tuesday that Bellamy was unlikely to return before the end of the season, after getting injured in the first leg of a UEFA Cup quarter final against Hamburg.         
	City were eliminated 4-3 on aggregate.         
	Craig has got to have complete rest for two weeks then he comes back for strength work, Hughes said. Hopefully he might get the last couple of games, but the probability is that he wont.

	Kimberley: The Kings XI Punjab bounced back into contention with a nail-biting three-wicket victory over the Deccan Chargers in a thrilling Indian Premier League match Saturday.         
	After restricting the formidable Deccan Chargers to 168 for five, built around Andrew Symondss unbeaten 60, the Kings XI rode Mahela Jayawardenes quick-fire 28-ball 43 and some lusty hitting by the tail-enders to scamper home with just one ball to spare.         
	The match swung one way and then the other till the dying moments before Kings XI, who desperately needed a victory to keep themselves afloat in the tournament, tilted the balance in their favour on a tricky track at the De Beers Diamond Oval.         
	With nine runs required from the last over, Kings XIs Piyush Chawla cracked a boundary off pacer R.P. Singhs first delivery and then held his nerve to rotate strike with Brett Lee to reach the target.         
	The Mohali outfits Sri Lankan import Mahela Jayawardene, with his fighting 43 off 28 balls, laid the foundation for the win which denied the Chargers their second victory on the trot.         
	Earlier, put to bat first, Symonds cracked an unbeaten 60 off just 36 balls to guide the Chargers to a competitive total.         
	The burly Australian, playing his first match in the second edition of the T20 event, rescued the Hyderabad side when they were struggling at 73 for four.         
	Symonds, who found an able ally in Y. Venugopal Rao (32 off 25) to add a crucial 95 for the sixth wicket, hit four sixes and two boundaries.         
	Chargers skipper Adam Gilchrist started on an attacking note by sending the fourth ball of the first over off paceman Brett Lee across the rope, followed by two more boundaries off Irfan Pathan in the next over.         
	Sreesanth dealt the first blow to the Hyderabad team by dismissing Gilchrist (20 off 16 balls) just when the Australian was getting into the groove after hitting three boundaries and a huge six.         
	Lee, playing his first match in this IPL, extracted good swing in his early overs to make the life of the Chargers batsmen difficult on a pitch that had a lot to offer to the bowlers.         
	Playing on an untested pitch, batsmen struggled to make big hits while the bowlers ruled the roost throughout the proceedings as the ball came slowly on to the bat.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav is the Knights face
                                                   Sourav is the Knights face
                      
	Those promoting the IPL had, obviously, taken it for granted that Sourav Ganguly would be retained as the Kolkata Knight Riders captain.         
	And, so, a hoarding at Cape Town airport reads: The Heat Is On... Which Side Are You On... The accompanying pictures feature Sourav and Sachin Tendulkar  the Knight Riders versus the Mumbai Indians.         
	One wonders whether Brendon McCullum has noticed it. Or, for that matter, Shah Rukh Khan.           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT IN CAPE TOWN

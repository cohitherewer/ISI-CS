The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fully committed to Wada code: Govt
                                                   Fully committed to Wada code: Govt
                      
	New Delhi: The Indian government is committed to the global anti-doping laws and fully accepts the new World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) code, including the contentious whereabouts clause which has been rejected by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).         
	Reacting to Wada chief John Faheys remarks that he had asked the Indian governments stand on the BCCIs rejection of the whereabouts clause, the sports ministry Saturday said there was no change from its earlier stand of full commitment to anti-doping rules.         
	The government and the National Anti-Doping Agency (Nada) stand fully committed to the Wada code, including the provisions related to the International Standards of Testing and the whereabouts clause.         
	We have informed the Wada that there is no change in the position of the government of India in so far as implementation of anti-doping rules adopted by the Nada, said Rahul Bhatnagar, joint secretary in the sports ministry and director general of Nada said.         
	Fahey during a teleconference on Thursday had said: The ICC are Wada code compliant and India is a member of the ICC. We have taken the matter up with Indian authorities and made a request if the Indian government supports the stand taken by the BCCI.         
	Our whole purpose and mandate is to ensure that theres harmonisation of the rules around the world including the cricket community which involves India, Fahey had said.         
	Speaking on the issue, Bhatnagar on Saturday said: Indias stand now and before has been the same. There is no compromise when it comes to doping in sport.         
	Bhatnagar said the BCCI has not responded to the ministrys communication regarding the advice it sought about the whereabouts clause.         
	In respect to the issue raised by the BCCI regarding the whereabouts clause, we have repeatedly been asking the BCCI about the advice they have sought in this matter. But we have not got any response either from the BCCI or from elsewhere as to what exactly was that opinion, he said.         
	Bhatnagar said the ministry will do whatever is required to get rid of doping in sports.         
	The Nada has fully accepted the Wada code which has been approved by the government of India. The whereabouts clause of the Wada has also been accepted by the Nada and the government of India. As far as anti-doping in sport is concerned, the government of India and the Nada will take all possible means to eradicate the menace from sports and we are ready to take the lead in this regard among the other nations in the world.         
	The Indian cricketers have rejected the whereabouts clause of the Wada code which requires athletes to give details of their location three months in advance for out of competition testing.         
	Cricketers say the clause infringes on their privacy and puts their security at risk.           (AGENCIES)

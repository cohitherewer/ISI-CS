The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC knew about reservations
                                                   ICC knew about reservations
    - Wada issue We cant force players to sign a document, says Prof. Shetty           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                        
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) is rushing lawyer Iain Higgins to Mumbai for a dialogue with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), but this step ought actually to have been taken weeks, if not months, back.         
	It was, after all, many moons ago when the BCCI informed the ICC that its players had reservations about the controversial anti-doping administration and management system, an out of competition procedure, prescribed by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).         
	Eleven Indian players, including two women (captain Jhulan Goswami, former captain Mithali Raj), are on the ICCs International Registered Testing Pool (IRTP) and, so, are covered by the procedure.         
	The mens list is headed by senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkar, followed by Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, vice-captain Virender Sehwag, Harbhajan Singh, Yuvraj Singh, Zaheer Khan, Gautam Gambhir, Irfan Pathan and Munaf Patel.         
	Theyve been selected by the ICC, not by the Wada.         
	According to the procedure, its mandatory for the players to let the ICC know of their whereabouts in the next quarter, starting August 1. Its intended to facilitate random testing.         
	That deadline has been missed.         
	Our players misgivings were conveyed to the ICC quite some time back This isnt a new development We cant force players to sign a document if they feel their privacy is being invaded and that their security could be compromised, the BCCIs chief administrative officer, Prof. Ratnakar Shetty, told The Telegraph.         
	Sachin and Dhoni, for example, are on the hit list of terror groups and, when not travelling with Team India, their movements are known only to a select few.         
	Speaking from Mumbai on Friday evening, Prof. Shetty added: Its not that our players have something to hide Far from it Theyre willing to be tested at random, no problems there, its just that they dont want to give out personal details Their unhappiness is over a particular clause.         
	Clearly, the BCCI is sensitive to the reservations expressed by Sachin and Co. and is strongly backing them.         
	The web-based procedure does allow the IRTP players to amend details of their whereabouts, but they will forever have to remember the information already forwarded to the ICC.         
	Having to possibly make changes every now and then may affect the players preparations before a series/tournament. In any case, its going to be a hassle and, on the face of it, doesnt seem practical.         
	Each IRTP player, by the way, has been given a code to go online and communicate with the ICC.         
	The biggest worry is that if a player misses two random tests, because of a change in his/her plans, then a stiff penalty will be slapped, Prof. Shetty pointed out.         
	Most, if not all, of the affected players are understood to have had a teleconference with the BCCI president, Shashank Manohar, recently.         
	That their stand hadnt changed was conveyed in unambiguous terms.         
	As reported, the BCCI has convened an emergent meeting of its working committee, on Sunday, to brief members on the Wada-specific impasse.

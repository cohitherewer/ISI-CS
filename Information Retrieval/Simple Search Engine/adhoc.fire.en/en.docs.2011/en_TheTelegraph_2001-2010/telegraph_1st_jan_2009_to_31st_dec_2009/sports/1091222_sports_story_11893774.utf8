	Calcutta: In the absence of China, India, who are fielding two teams, start as favourites in the Tata Steel Asian Team Chess Championship that gets underway at Town Hall on Tuesday, after being deferred by a day.         
	The premier Asian team event is being organised by Dibyendu Barua Chess Academy.         
	The India A team is led by GM Krishnan Sasikiran (Elo 2664). P. Harikrishna, who at 2672 is the highest rated Grandmaster in the meet, is in team A along with city-based GM Surya Sekhar (2654)  who had won the Asian Individual Chess Championship earlier this year  GM Parimarjan Negi (2620) and reserve board player Deepan Chakravarthy (2518).         
	The Indian mens team had won the championship only once in Jaipur in 2005, and was placed second in the last edition in January 2008.         
	The India A team can expect stiff challenge from Vietnam, which is the only other all-GM team. Vietnam had taken the bronze in the last meet in Visakhapatnam. The Vietnam team is not new to the city as most of its members have played here earlier.         
	Not to be discounted is the India B team. The team consisting IM R. Laxman (2511), IM Deep Sengupta (2488), IM B. Adhiban, (2486) and IM Himngshu Sharma (2469) might prove to be the dark horse in the tournament. The womens section, too, is likely to be dominated by the Indian teams

	Mens: India A vs Bangladesh; Singapore vs Vietnam; Iran vs Yemen; Sri Lanka vs India B; Indonesia vs Nepal

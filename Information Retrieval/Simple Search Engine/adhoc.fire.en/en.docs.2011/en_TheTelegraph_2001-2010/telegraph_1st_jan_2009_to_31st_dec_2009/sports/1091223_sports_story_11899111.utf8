The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvraj ruled out, Manoj included
                                                                                                                       7                                        Yuvraj ruled out, Manoj included
            A STAFF REPORTER            Yuvraj Singh                           
	Calcutta: Team India, already without regular captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, was dealt another blow when Yuvraj Singh was ruled out of the Eden one-dayer because of a finger injury.         
	The senior pro will miss the fourth and fifth one-dayers against Sri Lanka, the BCCI said on Tuesday.         
	Due to the finger injury sustained earlier, Yuvraj Singh has been advised rest and therefore will not play in the fourth and fifth ODI matches against Sri Lanka, secretary N. Srinivasan said in a statement.         
	Bengals Manoj Tiwary was included as the 15th member for the fourth ODI. The decision was taken after the BCCI thought it wasnt necessary to fly in a replacement hours before the match.         
	The Punjab all-rounder played his only match in the series in Cuttack on Monday, scoring 23 off 40 balls as India won by seven wickets to go 2-1 up in the five-match series.         
	Yuvraj sustained the injury while fielding during the second Twenty20 International against Sri Lanka in Mohali where the left-hander starred both with the bat and the ball to script Indias series-levelling win.         
	Yuvraj, who was also down with flu during the Nagpur one-dayer, didnt play the first two ODIs, with Virat Kohli substituting him in the playing XI.         
	This is the second serious injury he has suffered this year.         
	It may be recalled that Yuvraj fractured the little finger on his right hand in the midst of a conventional training session in Johannesburg on the eve of the Champions Trophy. That injury kept him out for almost six weeks.         
	He took part in five of the seven ODIs against Australia at home before Sri Lanka arrived. The left-handed batsman had averaged 25.60 in the series as he totalled 128 in the five innings he played.         
	His highest score in the series was 78. He had also taken two wickets in the series.         
	Team India are already without pacer Sreesanth, who is recovering from swine flu.         
	The decision to include Manoj was taken late in the evening. Manoj is a local boy. Also the fact that he is a brilliant fielder led to his inclusion. Since Yuvraj was a brilliant fielder, we wanted someone who could match him in this department. Since the arrangement has been done on an SoS basis, Manojs selection as the 15th member is strictly for this match. He will also be instructed to be present during the afternoon practice session on Wednesday, a source said.         
	Incidentally, the first time Manoj donned India colours was also as an additional member and against the same opponents  Sri Lanka in February 2007. The match was abandoned because of a downpour.

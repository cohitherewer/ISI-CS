                                                                                                                       7                                      Jeev: Let Woods sort it out with family
                      
	New Delhi: Jeev Milkha Singh refused to add fuel to the fire and said its for Tiger Woods and his family to sort out their crisis after reports of the iconic golfers numerous flings surfaced in the international media.         
	I have been asked by many people about Tiger Woods.         
	I can write pages and talk for hours on his golf, but the events of the last few days relate to his personal life. And thats something I do not wish to comment upon, said Jeev of the American golfer who was his playing partner in this years Augusta Masters and the 2006 HSBC Champions.         
	Its for him and the family to sort out, Jeev wrote on his blog.         
	At the Chevron World Challenge also, Woods, who was absent, had remained very much on the minds of golfers even as lurid speculation about his private life dwindled.         
	Walking out of my room, I had the newspaper at the front door  wasnt even front page today. That just says it all, doesnt it? Time moves on, Padraig Harrington had said.         
	Woods has been the subject of tabloid allegations of infidelity and internet celebrity gossip on the state of his relationship with his wife, Elin, finally issuing an admission himself of unnamed personal sins.         
	Looking back, Jeev said injuries marred his own performance this year and he wished 2010 to be different.         
	I am looking eagerly forward to the break. It has been a long year, which felt even longer because of the various injuries I had, Jeev said.         
	The reason I am talking injuries is because that is my biggest resolution for 2010  to try and stay fit and healthy. And I know several other players are also thinking along the same lines.         
	I have been to the Titleist Performance Institute in the US, and those guys are at the cutting edge of golf fitness. I have gone through the entire gamut of tests which gives us a very good idea about which parts of my body needs to be worked up on to handle the rigours of a golf swing. And I have been given customised exercise sets to work on those areas, said Jeev.         
	The Indian has already limited his workload and said he needed to streamline his programme further to get the best out of his tired body.         
	I have already cut down a lot on my playing commitment, and I need to be even better organised in 2010 as I want to play the mandatory number of events on both the US PGA and the European Tour, as well as participate in a few events in India, Asia and Japan, he said.

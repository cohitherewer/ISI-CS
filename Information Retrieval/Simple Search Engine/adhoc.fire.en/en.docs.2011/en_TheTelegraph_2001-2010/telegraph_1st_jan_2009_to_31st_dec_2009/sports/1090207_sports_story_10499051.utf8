                                                   EB look for fresh start
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal were among the best teams in the country when the current season started, but when they take on Air India at the Salt Lake Stadium Saturday in the 14th round of the I-League, the red-and-gold brigade would be staring at relegation.         
	East Bengal are lying at the ninth position with 13 points from as many matches. Subhas Bhowmick, the latest in the long line of coaches, is two matches old and his declared target of 27-28 points from the last 11 matches, at the moment, seems nothing more than wishful thinking. Under him, East Bengal have drawn their first match and lost the second.         
	The only problem East Bengal have is a lack of confidence. This is bound to happen when you lose the habit of winning. But tomorrow could be the day when we come back on track, Subhas told reporters after a practice session Friday morning.         
	We had created three sitters at Cooperage in our last match (against Mumbai FC). We lost because we couldnt convert even one of them. But those sitters have given me hope. We need just one win to turn it around, he said.         
	East Bengals hopes of scoring would once again rest on Sunil Chetri and Yusif Yakubu while the midfield would be led by Rennedy Singh. Alvito DCunha will miss one more match due to illness. But the real worry for Bhowmick would be the defence.

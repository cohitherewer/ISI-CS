The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL will help me: Jadeja
                                                   IPL will help me: Jadeja
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Ravindra Jadeja is on a high after being included in the 15-member India squad for the ICC World Twenty20 and feels a good run in the Indian Premier League will help him do better in the biennial event in England this June.         
	I am excited but my Rajasthan Royals teammates have asked me to concentrate on the remaining matches of the IPL, Jadeja told the IPLs official website.         
	I think a good run here will certainly help me perform better in England. Everyone knows IPL is a good platform to prepare, said the all-rounder.         
	The 20-year-old, who scored 60 in his lone ODI appearance for the senior team against Sri Lanka this February, is happy that his hard work has paid off. I think I am fortunate that my hard work has been noticed. I will get an opportunity to represent my country in the world championship, the Rajasthan Royals all-rounder said.         
	Royals skipper Shane Warne has also been effusive in his praise of Jadeja. Jadeja also admitted that Warne has been a great inspiration.         
	Shane had told me long time back that I will play for India. In fact he had said so during the first season of IPL itself, Jadeja said. He asked me not to think about it too much and concentrate on the next match here. He says if we get the basics right, everything else will fall into place. Shane has very high expectations from me and I know that I will justify that.         
	Besides Jadeja, Royals have another reason to cheer with Yusuf Pathan also making it to the India squad for the World Twenty20.

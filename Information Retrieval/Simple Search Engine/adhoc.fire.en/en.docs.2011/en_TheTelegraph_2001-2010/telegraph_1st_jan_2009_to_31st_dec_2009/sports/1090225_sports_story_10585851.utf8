The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dempos chance to join Asian elites
                                                     Dempos chance to join Asian elites
                  Roberto Silva                     
	New Delhi: Dempo will strive yet again to become the first Indian club to grab a spot in the AFC Champions League when they clash with Al Sharjah in a one-off match at Sharjah Stadium Wednesday.         
	Dempo had missed the bus last year in October when they lost to Safa SC of Lebanon in the semi-finals of the AFC Cup.         
	They now have the opportunity to make amends and reach the elite league.         
	The defeat to Safa SC still rankles Dempo coach Armando Colaco, but not one to cry over spilled milk, he is now getting ready for the biggest game in his career.         
	Reaching the AFC Cup semi-finals as the first Indian club was a milestone in itself and now we want to get into the Champions League, Colaco said over the phone from Sharjah.         
	He has to contend with a host of injuries but is confident his boys will give their best in the clash, the winner of which will qualify for the elite league.         
	Congolese midfielder Mboyo Iwomi has returned home after failing to recover from a groin injury. Central defender Dominic Noronha has twisted his knee and striker Joaquim Abranches has a thigh muscle strain.         
	Central defender Mahesh Gawli has a hamstring injury but the coach said he is likely to play.         
	He (Gawli) is a good player and realises the importance of the situation. Now is the time for him to stand and deliver, Colaco said.         
	In Mboyo and Joaquims absence, Roberto Mendes Silva could partner Ranty Martins upfront.         
	While a depleted squad is a cause for concern, Dempos biggest advantage could be the fact that they have played against a number of teams from West Asia.         
	I feel exposure at this level is always welcome. We have moved from strength to strength and now we stand on the threshold of qualification for the AFC Champions League.         
	The squad has watched video footage of Al Sharjahs local league matches.         
	The players are physically strong and they play a robust game, said Colaco who felt a double-leg qualifier would have been better.         
	But we cant complain now. It was AFCs decision and we have just to go and play.         
	Al Sharjah have recently had a change of coach but Colaco thinks that wont affect the hosts. (PTI)

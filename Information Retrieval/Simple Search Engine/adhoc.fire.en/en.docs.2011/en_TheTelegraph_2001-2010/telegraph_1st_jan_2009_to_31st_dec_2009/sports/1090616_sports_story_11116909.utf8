                              Egypt not easy for Brazil

	Bloemfontein: Kaka scored a last-minute penalty Monday to give Brazil a fortunate 4-3 win over Egypt in their opening game of the Confederations Cup but European champions Spain needed no such luck against New Zealand as Liverpool striker Fernando Torres scored a hattrick in their 5-0 drubbing of the Oceania champions on Sunday.         
	Brazil and their shaky defence looked to be heading for a disappointing draw after Mohamed Shawky and Mohamed Zidan scored a goal each during one second-half minute, but Ahmed Al Muhamadi was sent off for using his arm to block a shot on the line and Kaka smashed in the penalty for his second goal of the match.         
	Brazil will now almost certainly qualify for the second round of a tournament they have won twice, but the team will want an improved result and performance against the United States on Thursday.         
	The win gave the record five-time World Cup winners three points in Group B, which also includes Italy.         
	Kaka, Luis Fabiano and Juan had given Brazil a 3-1 halftime lead, but Egypt drew level through Shawky and Zidan, who scored Egypts first goal early on.         
	Brazil largely coasted against opponents 35 places below them in Fifa world rankings, with the only difference in the first half coming from three moments of individual inspiration.         
	The first came from Kaka on the edge of the area when the new Real Madrid playmaker stuck out a leg to collect a cross-field pass from Daniel Alves and instantly lifted it over defender Hani Said.         
	He looked to have flicked it too far but Said and Wael Gomaa failed to clear the loose ball and Kaka reacted quickest to calmly place a low shot past goalkeeper Essam El Hadary.         
	Zidan equalised for Egypt but striker Luis Fabiano restored Brazils lead when he deftly headed Elanos 12th-minute free kick to help it from just inside the area.         
	Brazils third standout moment was the dipping, swerving free kick by Alves that El Hadary punched out for a corner kick. Elano sent the corner over from the right for Juan to head in.         
	Torres scored a stunning hattrick in the opening 17 minutes and further goals from Cesc Fabregras and David Villa saw Spain stretching their unbeaten run to 33 matches. The win put them firmly on top of Group A.         
	The match was virtually all over as a contest after only six minutes when Torres sent in a curling shot from the edge of the penalty area well out of the reach of New Zealand keeper Glen Moss.         
	The Oceania champions were undone again eight minutes later when Albert Riera and David Villa combined on the left to create the second for Torres.         
	Spain, who have not lost since Romania beat them 10 in a friendly in Cadiz in 2006, continued to create chances with Riera thundering in a shot which Moss did well to save.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand signs truce with Grischuk
                                                   Anand signs truce with Grischuk
                      
	Linares: Viswanathan Anand settled for a draw with Russian Alexander Grischuk in the 13th and penultimate round of Linares chess tournament here on Saturday. Anand will meet Magnus Carlsen in the last round and the only way he can finish tied first is if he wins and both Grischuk and Vassily Ivanchuk lose the final round game  a highly unlikely scenario given the form of both the players.         
	Anand employed the Sicilian Najdorf and went for the sharp poisoned pawn variation. Grischuk showed that he had a new idea up his sleeves when he played his 20th move and Anand was forced to go in defence with his king side coming under pressure.         
	According to experts, a minor mistake by Grischuk on move 29th enthused life back in Anands position and the Indian came back strongly after another mistake by the Russian to force an equal position. The game was drawn after 33 moves.         
	Ivanchuk of the Ukraine rose to the occasion and defeated Levon Aronian of Armenia to joint Grischuk in lead on 7.5 points out of a possible 13. (PTI)

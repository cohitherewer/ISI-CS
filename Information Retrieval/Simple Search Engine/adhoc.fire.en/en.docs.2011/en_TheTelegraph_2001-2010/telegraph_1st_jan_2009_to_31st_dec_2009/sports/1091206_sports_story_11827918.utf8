    - FINAL test 
  -  Zaheer, Ojha break the back of Sri Lankan batting             K. KUMARASWAMY                                        Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara, on way to his unbeaten 133, on the fourth day of the final Test in Mumbai, on Saturday. (Reuters)     
	Mumbai: Pacers win Tests, goes the saying. After watching Zaheer Khan and Sreesanth take turns to break the back of the Sri Lankan batting, one could not have agreed more.         
	With the visitors 322 runs behind and two full days play left, the question Saturday morning at the Brabourne Stadium was when, not how, India would clinch the Jaypee Cup, and with it, the No.1 spot in the Test rankings.         
	But on a pitch that had seen more than 1100 runs on the first three days and promised more, India needed their bowlers to fire on all cylinders, and the Zaheer-Sreesanth combination played a crucial role in accomplishing that.         
	In eight overs between them in the post-lunch session, Zaheer (2-51) and Sreesanth (1-36) accounted for three of the Lankan top five, giving away just 16 runs.         
	Indias comprehensive bowling performance, which began with Harbhajan Singh sending off the in-form Tillekaratne Dilshan (16), was rounded off by Pragyan Ojha (2-84).         
	At stumps, Sri Lanka were 274 for six, still trailing by 59 runs.         
	Captain Kumar Sangakkara was the corner stone of Sri Lankas resistance. He was unbeaten on 133, his first century in India.         
	Both Zaheer and Sreesanth were guilty of not exploiting the moisture on the opening day. But on Friday, they were immaculate in line and length.         
	They were aided by a shrewd captain in Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who decided to bowl them alternatively from the north end, instead of bowling them in tandem.         
	 The ploy meant it was always a spin-pace attack, and Harbhajan Singh (1-28) turned out to be an invaluable weapon as he bowled tirelessly for 31 overs.         
	The in-form Dilshan was done in by another harsh decision, but after that setback, Sri Lanka diligently tried to steady the innings, with Tharanga Paranavitana (54) and Sangakkara negotiating all bowlers without trouble.         
	Sreesanth got the breakthrough when, an hour after lunch, Paranavitana tried to play him across the line and was hit on the pad in front of the stumps.         
	After the Kerala seamers short burst of 3-0-13-1, Zaheer got rid off Mahela Jayawardene (12) and Thilan Samaraweera (0), with two beautiful deliveries which even Wasim Akram would have been proud of.         
	First, bowling over the wicket, the left-arm pacer induced a faint edge from the former Sri Lanka captain, and then came round the wicket to consume Samaraweera with a short one which squared the batsman up.         
	The bounce and the movement was too much for Samaraweera to handle, and he ended up playing it towards slip, where VVS Laxman made no mistake. That particular spell by Zaheer read 5-3-3-2.         
	Thereafter, it was a matter of being patient. But the bowlers had become a little tired by then. The pair of Sangakkara and Prassana Jayawardene took advantage of that, to add 64 runs for the sixth wicket before the latter fell leg before to Ojha.         
	Sangakkara, with an aggregate of 228 from his previous nine innings in the subcontinent, had a point to prove.         
	 The elegant left-hander hit Ojha for a six over extra cover and a four, off successive balls. Then, a cover drive and a square cut off Zaheer Khan was followed up with two back to back boundaries off Sreesanth.

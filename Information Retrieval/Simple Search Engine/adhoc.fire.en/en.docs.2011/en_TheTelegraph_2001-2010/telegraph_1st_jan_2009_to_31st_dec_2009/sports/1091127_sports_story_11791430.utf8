            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Manoj Tiwary celebrated his place in the BCCI central contracts list with an unbeaten century, his tenth in first class cricket, at the Eden on Thursday. Tiwary added 196 runs in an unbroken third wicket partnership with Arindam Das.         
	The BCCI contract was definitely an extra motivation today It gives you confidence and makes you feel that you are there in the scheme of things, the stand-in Bengal captain against Saurashtra said.         
	Arindam, who played just one match last season, is happy to have justified the faith shown by the selectors. Its a performance oriented world. I applied myself according to the conditions The aim was not to play any loose shots. The team needed a good innings and Im happy to have got it, the Bengal opener said.         
	The innings was important because they scored a lot of runs and we needed to stay there to get the innings going. I did have to curtail my shots It was a more disciplined innings. We are looking for three points and the first session on the final will be as important, added Arindam.         
	Hes confident of overhauling Saurashtras 650. The pitch is playing true Theres nothing very alarming. We should get through tomorrow.         
	Off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri also echoed the sentiments. Weve got the right platform at the moment We need to finish it off well, said Lahiri.

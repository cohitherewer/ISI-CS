	Hamilton: Sachin Tendulkar on Tuesday pledged his support for tiger conservation and said that the Indian cricket team backed the cause of the critically endangered species.         
	At the start of the century, there were nearly 40,000 tigers in India. Today, that number has shrunk to 1,700 and we are losing at least one tiger a month. The rate at which the tigers are being hunted down is alarming, said Tendulkar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pathetic EB booted out of Durand Cup
                                                     Pathetic EB booted out of Durand Cup
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            East Bengal coach Bhowmick: Battered and bruised                           
	New Delhi: East Bengals awful run in the new season continued as they went down to newcomers Lajong Football Club by a solitary goal in a Group IV quarter-final league match at the Ambedkar Stadium on Tuesday.         
	The defeat also brought the curtain down on East Bengals campaign in the Durand Cup, a tournament they had won 16 times before. East Bengal has lost all the three matches they have played so far in the season, conceding eight goals.         
	East Bengals last match against Mahindra United becomes inconsequential as Lajong have finished with four points. East Bengal will finish with three even if they manage to beat the Mumbai outfit.         
	The defeat also raised serious doubts whether East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick would continue in his position after this. As hundreds of Lajong fans celebrated with drum beatings in the stands, Bhowmick was the first to walk off the field with his head bowed.         
	Later, the coach refused to speak to the waiting journalists and straightaway got into the team bus. Captain Syed Rahim Nabi got into a scuffle with a handful of irate fans who were venting their ire at Bhowmick. Players and officials intervened before things went out of control.         
	Club sources said there will be meeting at the team hotel on Wednesday morning to discuss the Durand debacle.         
	Lajong coach Stanley Rozario, who was unceremoniously ousted by East Bengal last season, said it was big victory for his team. We hope to do equally well in the I-League, he said.         
	Frankly speaking, the Calcutta team never looked like winning the tie despite showing some urgency in the first session. In the second, East Bengal looked a tired lot and allowed the Shillong side a lot of space and time to take charge of the proceedings.         
	Going by the trend of the match, East Bengal were lucky not to concede more goals in the later stages. After Kyrshan Lynshing struck in the 60th minute and exposed East Bengals defensive organisation,         
	Lajong created some chances in the rival goalmouth. Had not Boithang Hoakip and Recy K missed some easy chances, East Bengal would have faced bigger embarrassment.         
	The new formation that was adopted by the East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick failed to sparkle for most part of the outing. While the midfield shone only for a brief period, the two strikers  Subhas Singh and Argentine Sebastian Omar  looked ordinary in front of the rival goal.         
	Teams         
	Lajong FC: Gumpe Rime; Marlangki Suting, Aibor Khongjee, Weilad Mi Passan and Rojit Singh; Niwan Gatphoh, Daniel Bademi, Kyrshan Lynshing and Boithang Hoakip; James Gbilee and Samson Ramengmawia.         
	East Bengal: Arup Debnath; Jan Berger, Nirmal Chetri (Govin Singh, 39th), Mehrajuddin Wadoo and Soumik Dey; Harmonjit Singh Khabra, Riston Rodrigues, Alvito DCunha (B Bekhokhei, 62nd ) and Rennedy Singh (Sanju Pradhan, 82nd); Subhas Singh and Sebastian Omar.         
	Referee: Dinesh Nair (Gujarat).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team India aim to rediscover the winning touch today
                                                   Team India aim to rediscover the winning touch today
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Napier: India would be aiming to rediscover their winning momentum when they take on a rampaging New Zealand in the first match of the one-day International series starting here on Tuesday.         
	The Black Caps had hurt Indias pride defeating them 2-0 in the two Twenty20 Internationals last week.         
	A defeat in the first day-night match at the McClean Park on Tuesday would mean India would have to play catch-up with the Black Caps in the rest of the series. The visitors will miss the services of pace sensation Ishant Sharma in the first ODI.         
	The Indians, however, have the chance to rise up a notch and replace Australia as the second-placed team in the ICC one-day rankings if they manage to whitewash New Zealand 5-0 in the series. Mahendra Singh Dhonis team is currently third, four ratings points behind second-placed Australia and five behind top team South Africa.         
	A clean sweep will put India ahead of Ricky Pontings men by a fraction of a point but it would remain just behind the Proteas in what would be an extraordinarily tightly packed leader-board with one ratings point separating the top three ODI teams in world cricket.         
	For its part, New Zealand can move up to third ahead of India if they win the series 4-1 or better but it will drop as low as sixth if they suffer a 5-0 defeat. The series is also an opportunity for some of the top players to make further gains in the rankings.         
	Dhoni is currently enjoying the top spot in the rankings for batsmen but teammate Yuvraj Singh is hot on his heels in third position.         
	India have four batsmen in the top 20  Gautam Gambhir in 12th place and Virender Sehwag in 15th  not to mention Sachin Tendulkar in 21st position, compared to New Zealands single representation in Ross Taylor, who is placed 16th.         
	But it is the Black Caps bowling that has been most impressive of late with captain Daniel Vettori currently leading the rankings and Kyle Mills now in third spot, with a third bowler, Jacob Oram, in 19th place.         
	If India had begun their 48-day sojourn as the favourites, the tide has cruelly turned against them. They have been outdone by a set of talented all-rounders in the first two matches.         
	India desperately lack a match-winning all-rounder and in Ravindra Jadeja they had one in the making, but the left-hander has returned home after the T20 Internationals. His alacrity in the field coupled with his all-round abilities would have been of value to the side.         
	The shoulder injury to Ishant has also set India back. The wiry speedster had formed a formidable new-ball pair with Zaheer Khan, bowling out teams even on lifeless tracks. His pace and nagging accuracy would have come handy on this rock-hard wicket, which curator Phil Sotom described as good as gold.         
	Ishants indisposition, however, paves the way for either Praveen Kumar or Munaf Patel to find a place in the playing XI on Tuesday. The team management remains hopeful that the 20-year-old Ishant, who has scalped 37 wickets in 25 ODIs, will be ready for the second match at Wellington on March 6.         
	It is a return of sorts for Sachin, who hasnt played a game in almost three weeks, since being dubiously adjudged leg before wicket thrice in the one-day series in Sri Lanka, which India handsomely won 4-1.         
	The batting maestro said he was happy with his form. I have been working hard at the nets and have been hitting the ball well. I am looking forward to the ODIs, said Sachin, who will look to improve on his already glittering ODI record (16446 runs, 42 centuries).         
	Having garnered over 60 per cent of his runs as an opener, Tendulkar would seek to continue to open the batting. But with Gambhir and Sehwag forming a productive pair at the top, the team management would be inclined to stick to this combination.         
	Though it is too early on the tour to judge performance, Indian batsmen have not batted as well as they could.         
	The top order, which floundered in the T20s, would have to fire if the tourists are to win Tuesdays contest, and take the lead in the five-match series.         
	Only if Sehwag, Tendulkar and Gambhir provide the platform, Yuvraj, Suresh Raina, Dhoni and Yusuf Pathan would be able to play their natural game. With or without Ishant, India can reply to New Zealands pace with fire. And if the batting gets going, the visitors can destroy the hosts with their stroke-play.         
	But when it comes to fielding, the Black Caps hold a distinct edge over their opponents. Noticeably, the hosts athleticism has deprived India of vital runs, which could have possibly won the second T20 International at Wellington.         
	Interestingly, it is only the 76th ODI contest between the two teams, since rubbing shoulders with each other in the World Cup in 1975 for the first time. India have won 36 of these contests while New Zealand have come on top in 35. Definitely not much to choose between.         
	Teams         
	India (likely): Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Gautam Gambhir, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Yusuf Pathan, Irfan Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Praveen Kumar/Munaf Patel, Zaheer Khan.         
	New Zealand (likely): Jesse Ryder, Brendon McCullum, Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, Jacob Oram, Neil Broom, Grant Elliott, Daniel Vettori (capt.), Kyle Mills, Ian Bulter/Tim Southee, Iain Brien.         
	Match starts: 6.30 am (IST).

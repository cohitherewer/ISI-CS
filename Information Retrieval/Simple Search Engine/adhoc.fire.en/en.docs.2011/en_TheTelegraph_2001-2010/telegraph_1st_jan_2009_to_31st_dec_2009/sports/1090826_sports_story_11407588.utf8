            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/London: Andrew Flintoff underwent a routine arthroscopy and micro-fracture to two small areas in his right knee Monday night, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) medical team stated on Tuesday.         
	The recovery from the operation will require him to be non weight-bearing for the first six to eight weeks post surgery, the statement read. At the end of this six to eight week period, the knee will be reviewed by his surgeon and the timescale for ongoing rehabilitation further determined.         
	After the surgery, Flintoff said he longs to end his one-day career by winning the 2015 World Cup.

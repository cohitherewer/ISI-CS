	Mumbai: Cricket South Africa is likely to agree to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)s request to include two Test matches during their tour of India in February.         
	BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan, however, was non-committal. We have been talking to Cricket South Africa, but nothing has been finalised, he said.         
	In South Africa, CSA chief executive Gerald Majola confirmed the proposal by the BCCI. They have requested we play two Tests and three ODIs, and we are still considering It would mean extending the tour by another week, but we would like to accommodate them and I dont foresee a problem with it, Majola told a website.         
	The BCCIs move comes after severe criticism about Indias fixtures in the coming months. Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men, who claimed the No.1 spot in the ICC Test rankings last week, are scheduled to play only two Tests  against Bangladesh  in the next 11 months.         
	Indias tour of Bangladesh, comprising a tri-series with Sri Lanka as the third team and two Tests against the hosts, runs from January 5 to 28.

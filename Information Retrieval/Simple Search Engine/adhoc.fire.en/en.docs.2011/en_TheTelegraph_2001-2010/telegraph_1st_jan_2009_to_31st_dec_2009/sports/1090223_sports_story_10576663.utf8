The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lanka pile up massive total
                                                   Lanka pile up massive total
                      
	Karachi: Captain Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera broke the 52-year-old world record for a fourth-wicket stand Sunday as Sri Lanka posted a huge total against Pakistan in the first Test.         
	Sri Lanka declared their first innings at 644 for seven and Pakistan  needing 445 runs to avoid follow-on  lost opener Salman Butt (23) in Muttiah Muralidharans third over of the innings to finish the day at 44 for one.         
	Debutant Khurram Manzoor was unbeaten on 18 while newly appointed captain Younis Khan was yet to score.         
	Our strategy will be to wait for the loose ball and try to play a longer innings and stay at the wicket, Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam said.         
	Jayawardene and Samaraweera put on 437 runs for the fourth wicket, bettering the previous record of Englands Peter May and Colin Cowdrey, who got 411 against the West Indies at Edgbaston in 1957.         
	Jayawardene, who also shared in the world record partnership for any wicket  624 against South Africa in 2006  scored 240 while Samaraweera made 231 to notch his maiden double century.         
	Jayawardene  leading Sri Lanka in a series for the last time as he will step down after the second Test at Lahore  was finally out to a brilliant diving catch by wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal.

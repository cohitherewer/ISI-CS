The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Katich buries the ghosts of 2005 
                                                   Katich buries the ghosts of 2005 
            Ian Chadband                      
	Simon Katich, one of Australias fall guys in their 2005 series defeat, says the hurt of four years ago was the inspiration behind his first Ashes hundred at Cardiff.         
	The man from Perth was thrilled to have featured in a major partnership with his captain, Ricky Ponting, as the pair both made hundreds to help ease a few of the painful memories of the last visit here.         
	Katich, who survived a tough examination from Andrew Flintoff, his conqueror four times in 2005, said: Those who went through what happened four years ago cant forget that hurt.         
	Both Ricky and I went through it and were determined to turn it round from last time.         
	This was one of the most satisfying moments for me. You cant hide from the past; theres nowhere to hide in Test cricket.         
	The 33 year-old had such a struggle in the middle order in 2005 that he was dropped and regained his place only last May.         
	In the 13 months since, though, playing at the top of the order, he has compiled six hundreds in 16 Tests.         
	When I got the chance to bat at the top of the order against the West Indies I jumped at it and having been able to play for 12 months on the trot, Ive gained confidence and managed to string together some innings.         
	Katich believes he has become a completely different player from the 2005 model.         
	Last time around, I wasnt playing very well and I struggled to hit the ball straight, so I worked on my balance when I got dropped four years ago. I did wonder whether Id make it back.         
	He did so with the help of former Australia opener and coach Bob Simpson, who worked on the technical aspects with him.         
	I owe a huge amount to him, said Katich.         
	His support has helped turn me into a more confident player.         
	Katich reckoned he was thriving on being an elder statesman in an inexperienced Australian outfit.         
	 In the last 12 months Ive felt Ive got a role to play because weve lost a lot of experienced players, some of the greats of Australian cricket in the last few years.         
	But this is a hungry group; we showed that in the last series in South Africa. Were confident we can get on top of England.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

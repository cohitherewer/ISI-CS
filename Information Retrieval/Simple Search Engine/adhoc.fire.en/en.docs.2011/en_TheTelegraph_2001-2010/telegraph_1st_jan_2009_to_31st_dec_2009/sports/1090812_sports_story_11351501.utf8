The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Altaf is set to be sacked
                                                   CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	Altaf is set to be sacked   
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Boards chief operating officer Saleem Altaf is all set to be sacked at the PCBs next governing council meeting after a bitter fallout with chairman Ejaz Butt.  
	Yes it is true that Butt will ask the governing council members to change the COO as he is not happy with the fact that Altaf has started questioning his decisions, a source confirmed.         
	Qadir U-turn         
	 Karachi: Former chief selector Abdul Qadir has backed down from his earlier comments that some Pakistan players could have contact with suspected Indian bookmakers and said he was only voicing concern about the possibility of match fixing. I never took any names. I only voiced my suspicions like others were doing, Qadir said.         
	Ramiz view         
	 Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja has advised some of the national team players to say goodbye to international cricket themselves rather then being dropped after their dismal performance in Sri Lanka. Without taking names, Ramiz said some players must themselves set a good precedent and leave international cricket to allow younger players to fill in their boots.         
	WCAI demand         
	 New Delhi: The Womens Cricket Association of India Tuesday demanded action against V. Chamundeshwarnath, who was expelled from the Andhra Cricket Association (ACA) for allegedly harassing woman cricketers.         
	We have written to Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy to take appropriate action against the offender. He has misused his position and shaken the faith of many young women, said WCAI president Renu Jogi.         
	Luke case         
	 New Delhi: The Kings XI Punjab on Tuesday threw its weight behind Luke Pomersbach, who has been suspended by Western Australia for allegedly assaulting a policeman. Luke Pomersbach is an integral part of the Kings XI Punjab team and we are concerned for his well being. The team hopes that the matter will be resolved quickly, Kings XI promoter Ness Wadia said.         
	ECB statement         
	 Calcutta: The England and Wales Cricket Board said in a statement on Tuesday that some remarks which have been posted on a website purporting to be from England batsman Ian Bell were not by the cricketer. These remarks were definitely not posted by Ian Bell. They are the work of a hoaxer and therefore should be disregarded, the statement said.         
	Rubel out         
	 Dhaka: Bangladeshs depleted bowling attack received another injury blow when pacer Rubel Hossain was ruled out of the remainder of the ODI series against Zimbabwe with a side strain on Tuesday. Skipper Mashrafe Mortaza and left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak have already returned home.

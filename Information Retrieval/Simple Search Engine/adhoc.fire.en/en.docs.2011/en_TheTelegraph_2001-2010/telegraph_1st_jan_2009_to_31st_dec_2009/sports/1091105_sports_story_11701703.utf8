The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Top order needs to do well: Dhoni
                                                                                                                                   Top order needs to do well: Dhoni
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hyderabad: Mahendra Singh Dhoni was effusive in his praise of youngsters during the media conference on Wednesday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Indias poor record in Hyderabad (India have lost both their matches here)         
	Not worried Not reading too much into it.         
	Series locked 2-2         
	When it became 1-1, I said its like a five game series. Now we can see its a three-game series. Every game is important When the number of games get reduced its important not to have an off day.         
	The wicket         
	Looks like a good wicket It responded very well even during the Champions League. There was good bounce for the bowlers and, at the same time, it was coming nicely onto the bat.         
	The start, if India bat first         
	For us, it all depends on the start We rely a lot on the start. And we dont want to get into the game with a big score in mind. Its important to get a good start, get on to a big score and dictate terms.         
	If it was time the top order contributed         
	If we bat well as one unit and have plenty of partnerships, it does not matter who gets the runs as long as we get them.         
	Ravindra Jadejas performance         
	Hes batting at No.7 and filling the space of a bowling all-rounder. His batting also is important. For someone bating at No.7, its about scoring quickly.         
	Harbhajan Singhs bowling         
	He has bowled really well in the last couple of games. We cant complain much as hes got back his rhythm. Hes also bowling in the right areas.         
	The new ball bowlers         
	They have always got off to a good start. Even if we havent got the wickets, we have been able to contain them. Ashish (Nehra) has been the pick of the bowlers. Praveen has also done well. Ishant was off in the first couple of game but has done well thereafter. Last game, he got targeted a bit Overall, Im quite happy with their performance.         
	If a cramped itinerary was behind the Aussie injuries         
	The usual two-day gap between matches is there, apart from Delhi and Mohali, which is enough to recover. Its evenly spaced.

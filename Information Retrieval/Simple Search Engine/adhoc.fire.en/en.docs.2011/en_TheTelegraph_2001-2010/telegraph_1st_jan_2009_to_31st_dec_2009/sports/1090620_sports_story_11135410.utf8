The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AIFF stays away from Bobs barb
                                                   AIFF stays away from Bobs barb
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Friday chose to distance itself from Bob Houghtons comments on the union sports minister, saying it was the personal opinion of the national coach.         
	On Thursday, Houghton criticised the sports minister, MS Gill for comparing the Indian football team with the Australian school team and said the minister should better concentrate on creating training facilities for the national team.         
	Expectedly, the AIFF posted a press release in its official website that said: the statement made by Houghton were his personal opinion.         
	The AIFF acknowledges the support it is getting from the Sports Ministry since Mr. Gill became the sports minister.         
	AIFF requires support from all quarters in their endeavour to field a strong and well-prepared team in the AFC Asian Cup in 2011.         
	The ministry is believed to have assured the AIFF of bearing at least 30 per cent of the cost for the preparation of the Asian Cup. Gill was also responsible for promoting football to the list of priority sports after he took charge of the ministry.

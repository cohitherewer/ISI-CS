                                                   Doctor: Not surgery, Massa needs rest 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                                Felipe Massa      
	Formula One driver Felipe Massa returned to his Brazilian home after hospital tests ruled out the need for further surgery following his crash at last months Hungarian Grand Prix.         
	Massa, who suffered head injuries that doctors described as life-threatening in the accident, was Tuesday released from Sao Paulos Albert Einstein Hospital after a series of in-depth tests, said Dino Altmann, his personal doctor.         
	Felipe has had a remarkable recovery, Altmann said.         
	The outcome is very encouraging. The best thing for him now is to go back home, where he can calmly convalesce and rehabilitate. We did new blood exams, repeated brain tomography, brain resonance, hes undergone an ophthalmic exam, and the conclusion is that Felipe has no need of a new surgery right now.         
	The only recommendation for him is for rest at home, the physician added.         
	No timetable has been given for Massas return to Formula One.         
	Altmann said Massa will go through periodic re-evaluations and further exams in the near future, but did not make any predictions on when the driver may return to racing.         
	We cant say when he will be able to race again, Altmann said. Its too early to talk about that. Its going to depend on the re-evaluations. We have to make sure there is no risk. Im sure he will follow our recommendations so he can return as soon as possible.         
	Massa, 28, flew to Sao Paulo on Monday to undergo further examination after fracturing his skull and suffering a concussion in a July 25 qualifying crash at the Hungaroring near Budapest. Hungarian military doctors performed emergency surgery and kept him sedated after the operation.         
	Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher will come out of retirement to replace Massa until the Brazilian is ready to return, Ferrari said.         
	The next race is the European Grand Prix in Valencia, Spain on August 23.         
	Although rivals Red Bull and Williams have said they are opposed to the German veteran testing Massas F60 car, the prospect of Schumachers return has got the Formula One world excited.         
	Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone said Schumacher was still good to give one or two of them (the drivers) a driving lesson.

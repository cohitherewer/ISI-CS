                                                   Kirmani lauds Sachin
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Former chairman of the national selection committee Syed Kirmani on Saturday lauded Sachin Tendulkars decision to opt out of Twenty20 Internationals.         
	It is a good move from Sachin. India need him for Tests and the 2011 World Cup and theres no point in putting the T20 pressure on him. Moreover the young brigade is doing very well in T20, so with Sachin opting out the balance also is not disturbed, Kirmani said on the sidelines of a cricket documentary release function, organised by the public diplomacy division of the ministry of external affairs. The documentary is an endeavour of Allsport Foundation.         
	Kirmani said that India would be the favourites in the forthcoming series against New Zealand.         
	Ajit Wadekar was not ready to place present captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the same bracket with Sourav Ganguly. Sourav has achieved everything as a captain, Dhoni will have to be at the helm for a long time to achieve that. Its too early to compare him with Sourav.         
	Earlier, external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee released the DVD of the documentary titled Hum Sab Ek Hain. The 27-minute documentary traces Indian crickets travel from the British Raj to the present age.         
	Mukherjee paid rich tributes to Kapils Devils who won the Prudential World Cup in 1983. I still remember the day. The breaking news of the victory was given to me by Mrs (Indira) Gandhi. Thanks to the players who made that possible, he said.

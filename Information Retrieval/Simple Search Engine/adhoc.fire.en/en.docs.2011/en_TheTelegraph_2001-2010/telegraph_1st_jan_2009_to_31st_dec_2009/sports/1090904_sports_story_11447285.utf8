The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Leave my sister alone: Safin 
                                                   Leave my sister alone: Safin 
                      
	New York: Marat Safin threw a protective arm around his little sister Dinara Wednesday after the Russian world No. 1 was slammed for her wobbly performance in the first round of the US Open.         
	Ever since Safina ascended to the top of the rankings in April, she has come under a barrage of criticism as she had yet to back up her standing with a Grand Slam title.         
	Safin, a former world No. 1 himself, said people should just shut up and accept the WTA rankings.         
	Everybody is hard on her why shes No. 1. Is she a real number one or not? You open the page (of a newspaper and all you read about is), she made eight double faults, 43 unforced errors She struggled, almost lost to (an) 18-year old, Safin said.         
	Who cares? I mean, shes No. 1 in the world. I have to protect my sister. The poor girl, shes trying her best. She gets the attention, but not the kind of attention that a person deserves, especially when youre number one in the world.         
	 She didnt do the ranking. Deal with that. Leave her alone.           (REUTERS)

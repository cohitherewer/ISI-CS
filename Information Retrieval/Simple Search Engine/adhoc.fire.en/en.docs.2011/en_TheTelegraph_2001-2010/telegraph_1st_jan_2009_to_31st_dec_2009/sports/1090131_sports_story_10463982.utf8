The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Uniteds chance to race ahead
                                                   Uniteds chance to race ahead
                      
	London: Manchester United have ruthlessly removed Liverpool from top spot in the Premier League and defeat for the Anfield Club by Chelsea at home on Sunday would leave them contemplating another season as also-rans in the title race.         
	Rafael Benitezs side are leaking points to such an extent they could find themselves five points adrift of the defending champions come kickoff against Chelsea, who now look the chief threat to United.         
	United face sixth-placed Everton on Saturday on the back of a top flight record of 11 consecutive clean sheets, and with players leaving the treatment room in droves Alex Fergusons side look perfectly positioned for a sprint towards an 18th English title. Villa host Wigan on Saturday when victory will push them into second place  significantly upping the stakes for Liverpool and Chelsea 24 hours later.         
	Things are also interesting further down the table with two matches on Saturday particularly crucial. Third bottom Middlesbrough have gone 11 league games without a win and host Blackburn Rovers, who are just one point and one place above them. Bolton Wanderers face fellow strugglers Tottenham Hotspur. (REUTERS)

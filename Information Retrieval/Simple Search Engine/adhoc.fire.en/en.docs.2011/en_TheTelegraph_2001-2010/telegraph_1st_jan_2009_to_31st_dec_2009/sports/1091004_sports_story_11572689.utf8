	London: Manchester United salvaged a stoppage-time 2-2 draw against Sunderland on Saturday thanks to an Anton Ferdinand own goal.         
	Premier League champions United had been facing their first Old Trafford loss to Sunderland in 41 years until the brother of United defender Rio Ferdinand deflected Patrice Evras off-target strike into the net.         
	Sunderland had been reduced to 10 men in the 85th minute when former United player Kieran Richardson was shown a second yellow card for kicking the ball away in frustration after referee Alan Wiley had blown for a free kick.         
	The visitors led inside seven minutes through Darren Bents low strike, but United striker Dimitar Berbatov equalised early in the second half with a perfectly executed scissor kick. Kenwyne Jones headed Sunderland back in front in the 58th when goalkeeper Ben Foster failed to deal with a high ball into the box.         
	We didnt come to sit back at Old Trafford, Jones said. As you can see they always have a tendency to come back.         
	Elsewhere, Portsmouth secured their first points of the season by beating Wolverhampton 1-0 to halt a run of seven straight losses. Midfielder Hassan Yebda, on-loan from Benfica, headed in Kevin-Prince Boatengs cross after 19 minutes to lift the gloom at Pompey, whose players wages went unpaid this week and whose owner was hospitalised while trying to secure vital funding for the club.         
	While the south-coast teams players will now also hope to receive win bonuses, they remain in last place, a point behind West Ham, who have played two games less.         
	Its fantastic  weve waited a long time for it, Hart said. We have shown great courage in difficult situations and we stuck in today (Saturday).         
	Tottenham at the same time (after eight games) last year had just two points, so we are one better than they were. We know we have our work cut out to rise up the table.Tottenham came from behind twice at Bolton on Saturday to earn a 2-2 draw.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Will have last word vs India:   Afridi 
                                                   Will have last word vs India:   Afridi 
                            
	Johannesburg: India have been lucky to have beaten Pakistan in all the ICC events, all-rounder Shahid Afridi said on Monday. But this time we will buck the trend by getting the better of them. So far, luck has been with India. Hopefully, it would all change, Afridi said.         
	Pakistan will take on India in a group B clash at Centurion on Saturday.         
	Looking back at the 2003 World Cup match between the two sides, which Pakistan lost, Afridi said a lot has changed and his team is a lot better than what it was at that time.         
	That was 2003. This is 2009. Its been six years. We are a very good one-day side now. We not only have good batting but our bowling is also exceptional, said Afridi.         
	Indians, along with hosts South Africa, are claimants to the worlds best one-day batting side tag but Afridi said Pakistan are no less.         
	If they claim themselves to be the best, I would say we are also the best. Every team knows its strength. We have a very balanced side. Still, I dont take any side lightly, he said.         
	In one-day cricket, we should not think that we can win easily against any team. There have been examples when big teams have lost to small sides.         
	However, bowling, as I said, has been our chief weapon which has helped us win, Afridi said.         
	Pakistans bowling, led by Mohammed Amir and Umar Gul, backed by spinner Saeed Ajmal and Afridi himself, looks strong.         
	Afridi, who will be leading the side in the absence of regular skipper Younis Khan, who has been ruled out with a finger injury, said: I hope to come up to expectations.         
	I already captained in Sri Lanka (in the Twenty20), with success and Ive been backed by the players, he added.         
	Afridi has established himself as one of the biggest hitters of the game and similar is the reputation that Yuvraj Singh enjoys in the Indian line-up.         
	The Pakistani all-rounder had little hesitation in declaring the Indian left-hander as a better batsman than him.         
	Yuvraj is a better batsman than me, I have no doubt, he said.

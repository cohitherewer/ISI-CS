                                                   Indians on Antwerp radar
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Several Indian footballers will be reigniting their dream of plying trade in Europe when scouts from a Belgian club come calling at their training centre in Barcelona next week.         
	According to sources, well-known Belgian club, Royal Antwerp are sending their spotters to Barcelona, where the Indian team is currently camping under British coach Bob Houghton.         
	The players who would be watched by the spotters are goalkeeper Subrata Paul, defender Gourmangi Singh, midfielders Steven Dias and N.P. Pradeep and striker Abhishek Yadav. Dias, however, sources said, could be the most keenly watched player in the whole lot.         
	The move is believed to have been initiated by Eddie Rock, a Fifa licensed agent, who had earlier signed up half a dozen Indian players.         
	Sources revealed that initially the agent wanted the Indian players to go to Belgium for a week and appear in trials for Royal Antwerp. Houghton, however, was opposed to the idea and suggested the club spotters to come to Barcelona to have a look at the players.         
	Royal Antwerp is one of the oldest clubs in Belgium. It is also the last Belgian club to play in the European club final in 1993. The club also have a long term partnership with Manchester United.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Collingwood, Shah boost England
                                                   Collingwood, Shah boost England
                      
	Georgetown: Paul Collingwood (69) and Owais Shah (62) hit half centuries to lift England to 270 for seven in the opening one-day International at the Providence Stadium in Guyana on Friday. Shah and Collingwood added 98 in 19 overs for the fourth wicket to boost the England innings on a slow surface. Ravi Bopara chipped in with a useful 43.               
	At midnight, the West Indies were six for one, chasing a target of 271. Lendl Simmons was batting on three while Ramnaresh Sarwan was yet to open his account.               
	West Indies didnt help themselves by sending down a staggering 23 wides in a wayward bowling display.         
	England made two changes after the Twenty20 defeat, with Matt Prior and Steve Harmison returning to the side, as they continued to search for a balance that worked.         
	Shah, who responded after a disappointing Test series, reached his half-century from 67 balls while Collingwood took 58. They worked well in combination without trying anything too flamboyant. Collingwood twice flicked Nikita Miller over mid-wicket while Shah preferred the third man area.

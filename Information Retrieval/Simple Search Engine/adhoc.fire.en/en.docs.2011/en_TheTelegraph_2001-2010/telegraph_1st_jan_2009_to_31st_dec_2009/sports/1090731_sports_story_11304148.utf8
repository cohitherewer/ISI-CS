The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australians off to a brisk start
                                                     Australians off to a brisk start
                  Watson                     
	Birmingham: Australia made a confident start in the third Ashes Test against England as Shane Watsons unbeaten fifty lifted them to 126 for one on a rain-disrupted first day.         
	The start of the match was delayed by six hours but Watson, recalled in place of Phillip Hughes, and Simon Katich played a series of crisp strokes to seize the initiative against a subdued England seam attack on Thursday.         
	Katich fell for 46 to off-spinner Graeme Swann but Watson had moved on to 62 at the close, including 10 fours, with his captain Ricky Ponting on 17.         
	Ponting won the toss and Watson was promoted up the order to partner Katich, immediately looking comfortable in an unfamiliar role.         
	He almost played on a delivery from Andrew Flintoff but welcomed Graham Onions to the attack with a perfect off-drive for four to bring up the 50.         
	Watson drove the same bowler straight for four and pulled him fiercely through square leg.           (REUTERS)

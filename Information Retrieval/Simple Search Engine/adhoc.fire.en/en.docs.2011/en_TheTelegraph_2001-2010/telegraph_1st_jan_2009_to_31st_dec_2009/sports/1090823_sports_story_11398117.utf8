	New Delhi: Sri Lanka made a sensational comeback in the last 10 minutes to beat Lebanon 4-3 in their Nehru Cup round robin match at the Ambedkar Stadium Saturday.         
	Lebanon were sailing smoothly with a 2-1 lead before the match took a dramatic turn in the 80th minute when Lanka hit back with a three-goal blitz in a span of nine minutes.         
	Lanka shot into the lead in the seventh minute through Issadeen but Lebanon hit back within two minutes through Akram Moghrani. Ali Saad made it 2-1 in first half time added on.         
	Lanka, however, reserved their best for the last 10 minutes. Issadeen converted off a rebound in the 80th minute to make it 2-2 and three minutes later, Roumy Mohideen put them ahead. Then it was Issadeens turn again to extend the lead with a quick shot to the corner of the net in the 89th minute.

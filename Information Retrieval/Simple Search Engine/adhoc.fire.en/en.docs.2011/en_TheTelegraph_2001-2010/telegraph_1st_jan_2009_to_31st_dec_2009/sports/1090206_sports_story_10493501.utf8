The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | West in control
                                                   West in control
                      
	Chennai: A fluent unbeaten century by Ajinkya Rahane (109) and sparkling knocks by captain Wasim Jaffer (69) and Bhavik Thakkar (73) helped West Zone cruise to 303 for five at close on the opening day of the Duleep Trophy final against South Zone here Thursday.         
	At one stage, West were in a commanding position at 297 for three, with Rahane and Thakkar going great guns. But Sreesanth struck two decisive blows towards the end of the day to tilt the scales in favour of South as both the teams trooped out honours even after an engrossing days play.         
	Rahane, mixing caution with aggression, paced his knock well after West were in some trouble at 163 for three, losing skipper Wasim Jaffer and Cheteshwar Pujara in quick succession in the post-lunch session.         
	However, Rahane and Thakkar handled the South Zone bowlers with aplomb.           (UNI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Serena bares all
                                                   Serena bares all
                      
	World No. 1 Serena Williams could be stripped of her right to play in the Australian Open in 2010 for baring all for a sports magazine and for her extraordinary outburst in the US Open semi-finals. Williams is under an International Tennis Federation investigation and faces a ban of up to two Grand Slams under the sports code of conduct.         
	The ITF have the power to strip Williams of more than $ 500,000 in prize money and impose a ban.         
	The threat to Williams comes as she bared all and posed nude for the front cover of a magazine.

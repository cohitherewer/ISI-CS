The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni and Co. arrive in the West Indies
                                                   Dhoni and Co. arrive in the West Indies
                      
	Port of Spain: A 16-member Indian team, eager to somewhat ease the pain of their Twenty20 World Cup debacle, arrived here from London to play in a four-match ODI series against the West Indies starting June 26.         
	The visitors landed at the Norman Manley International Airport in Jamaica Friday without key players Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag and Zaheer Khan.         
	But captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was confident his team had the wherewithal to challenge the inconsistent West Indies as they play the first two matches at Sabina Park on June 26 and 28. The next two matches would be played in St Lucia on July 3 and 5.         
	When it comes to playing for your country you dont really need motivation to go out and perform. West Indies is playing good cricket at the moment. They are having a very good (World) T20 tournament, but in the 50 overs, you have time to settle down, said Dhoni.         
	After playing so much T20, 50 overs seems like a Test match, quipped Dhoni.         
	Coach Gary Kirsten, who said fatigue and injuries resulted in Indias failure in the T20 World Cup, admitted the experienced players would be missed but said it was the time for youngsters to seize the opportunity.         
	Youre always going to miss them because they are great players, but its a great opportunity for a tour of this nature for young players to show what theyre made of, said Kirsten.         
	Were looking to those young players for the future as well. This is a great opportunity for these guys to stake their claim.         
	Tendulkar opted out of the tour as he wanted rest. Zaheer was rested while Sehwag is injured.           (PTI)

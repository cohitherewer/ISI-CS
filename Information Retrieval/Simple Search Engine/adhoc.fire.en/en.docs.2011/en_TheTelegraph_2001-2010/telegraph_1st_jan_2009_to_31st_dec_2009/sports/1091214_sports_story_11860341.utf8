The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lalit Modi faces a fresh crisis
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lalit Modi faces a fresh crisis
                      
	New Delhi: A week after his bid to regain control of the Rajasthan Cricket Association failed in an acrimonious election, Lalit Modi now faces a fresh crisis with a powerful lobby within the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), plotting to remove him from the Indian Premier League (IPL) commissioners post.         
	Modi, who has successfully conducted two editions of the IPL and filled the BCCI coffers with his marketing acumen, has been having problems with some of the key BCCI functionaries for some time now.         
	According to sources in the know of the development, the move to remove Modi as the IPL commissioner and chairman has been gaining momentum within the board.         
	There is a move within the BCCI to remove Modi as IPL chairman and commissioner. The argument is that the IPL is a BCCI event and logically the BCCI president should head it as an ex officio member.         
	It does not mean that Modi will have no role at all in the running of the IPL but it is only that he should not be heading the show, the source disclosed.         
	Although no BCCI official was willing to go on record on this development, it is learnt that BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan, known to be at loggerheads with Modi, is in the forefront of this campaign.         
	The move has not yet come up for formal discussion in working committee meetings but is being pursued privately to garner support.         
	These things are not discussed in working committee meetings where only items listed in the agenda are taken up for deliberation. But yes, behind the scene, it is discussed, the source said.

                                                   Super Kings crush Royal Challengers
                      
	Port Elizabeth: The Chennai Super Kings put their title defence back on track in stunning fashion with a massive 92-run win over the Royal Challengers Bangalore in an Indian Premier League (IPL) match here Monday.         
	The Chennai side first scored 179 for five, riding on Australian Matthew Haydens blistering 35-ball 65, and then bundled out Bangalore for just 87 in 15.2 overs.         
	Hayden, who retired from international cricket earlier this year, was at his dominating best, picking gaps at will to reach his third IPL half-century in just 22 balls, and in the process, helping the Chennai side to the highest Twenty20 score at St Georges Park here.         
	If Hayden was the batsman around whom the Chennai innings built their innings after captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni won the toss, it was Sri Lankan spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan, who bamboozled the Bangalore batsmen with his variations and turn, returning figures of 3/11 from four overs. Laxmipathi Balaji took two wickets while Manpreet Gony, Andrew Flintoff, Albie Morkel and Joginder Sharma chipped with one wicket each to throttle the Bangalore batsmen.         
	Set a huge target of 180 at nine per over, Bangalore were never in with a chance as their top five were gone by the eighth over for a mere 50 runs.

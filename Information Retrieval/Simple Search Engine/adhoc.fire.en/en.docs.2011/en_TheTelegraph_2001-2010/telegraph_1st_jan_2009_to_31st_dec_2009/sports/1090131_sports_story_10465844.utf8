                                                   Revenge on East Bengal minds 
                      
	Mumbai: East Bengal have a fine chance of not only avenging their earlier shock defeat at home against Mumbai FC but also improving their standing when the two teams clash in their 13th round I-League fixture at the Cooperage ground here on Saturday.         
	Mumbai FC, who had a great start to the league when they upset East Bengal and Mohun Bagan in away games, have fallen off a bit but are still standing fourth in the table with 19 points to their credit.         
	East Bengal, on the other hand, have failed to do justice to the star-studded line-up they possess and are languishing at eighth place with a mere 13 points. Saturdays clash provides them a good opportunity to strike form.         
	The Calcutta side will, however, miss their star striker Sunil Chetri who is unlikely to reach Mumbai in time for the match after he failed to impress the Coventry City boss in the trials in England. There are also concerns over Ghanaian striker Yusif Yakubus fitness.         
	They would once again look forward to some inspirational play from Rennedy Singh and Sanju Pradhan, not to speak of experienced campaigner Alvito DCunha to break through the Mumbai FC defence which let in three goals against Mohun Bagan on January 23 in the return leg here.         
	Mumbai FC would also be without their injured defender Anas Edathodika. Winger Subhash Chakraborty is doubtful and goalkeeper Amit Singha Roy is out with an injury. The encouraging news for the Mumbai team is that Kalyan Chaubey is available for duty.         
	They are pinning their hopes on Ghanaians Felix Aboagye and Abel Hammond to break through the rival defence with help from the midfield. (PTI)

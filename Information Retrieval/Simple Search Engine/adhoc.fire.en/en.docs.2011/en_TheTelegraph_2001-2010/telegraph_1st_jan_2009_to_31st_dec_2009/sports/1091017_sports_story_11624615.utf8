The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United look to do it without Rooney 
                                                     United look to do it without Rooney 
    - Gerrard doubtful vs Sunderland; Chelsea take on Villa                 Paul Scholes (left) and Dimitar Berbatov                           
	London: Manchester Uniteds attempt to keep up with early season pacesetters Chelsea at the top of the Premier League could be hit by injury to key players during international duty.         
	Although goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar should be fit to start his first match of the season against Bolton Wanderers on Saturday, striker Wayne Rooney is out on a calf injury with midfielder Darren Fletcher also looking set to be on the sidelines.         
	Rooney, who has hit seven goals for United this season, thriving in a central position since Cristiano Ronaldos move to Real Madrid, could also miss Wednesdays Champions League match at CSKA Moscow. Rooneys out: thats the one certainty, manager Alex Ferguson said Friday. Were doing our best to get him fit for Wednesday, but Ive got my doubts.         
	Given that Rooney is the lynchpin of the United attack, Ferguson must be hoping Dimitar Berbatov continues the form he showed in hitting a hattrick for Bulgaria midweek in World Cup qualifiers.         
	Berbatov has struck three goals this season and scored a last-minute winner at Bolton last season, when United finished four points clear of Liverpool for their third title in a row and a record-equalling 18th crown.         
	With Uniteds defence looking shaky this season and conceding twice in a draw with Sunderland two weeks ago, the absence of Fletcher could be just as big a blow for United, who rely heavily on the Scotland midfielders ability to shield the back four.         
	Bolton are looking increasingly resilient having won twice and drawn twice in their last four matches to rise from 19th to 13th, and have twice won at Old Trafford since returning to the top flight in 2001.         
	United know victory could help them close a two-point gap on Chelsea, who have a tough match against Aston Villa on the same day.         
	Villa have already beaten Liverpool this season and could trouble a Chelsea side that showed they are vulnerable when they lost 1-3 at Wigan last month. Chelsea won both last seasons meetings between the sides but drew 4-4 and lost 2-0 the year before.         
	As for Liverpool, who meet Sunderland Saturday, manager Rafael Benitez will attempt to nurse Steven Gerrard through a trio of domestic and European matches that could make or break the clubs season.         
	Gerrard sat out training Thursday having returned early from international duty with England because of a groin problem. The midfield player has undergone a scan that revealed that the injury is not serious. Benitez, though, will not risk Gerrard away to Sunderland if there are any doubts over his fitness, particularly with a vital meeting with United to come a week on Sunday and a Champions League group game against Lyons on Tuesday.         
	At this stage, the chances of Fernando Torres featuring are stronger than Gerrards, even though he also did not train Thursday. The Spain striker was not involved in his countrys 5-2 victory over Bosnia-Herzegovina on Wednesday. The Liverpool manager will have been delighted to see Alberto Aquilani, the midfield player, in training with his teammates Thursday for the first time since joining in a 20million deal from Roma in the summer.Liverpool need victory at Sunderland to keep their faltering campaign on track but could come up against one of their former players with a point to prove.         
	Former Dutch international Boudewijn Zenden, whose last appearance for the Reds was a poor showing in the 2007 Champions League final loss to AC Milan, joined on a free transfer on Friday after four months without a club. He could make his debut Saturday.         
	On Sunday, Blackburn host Burnley and Wigan host Manchester City, while Hull are at Fulham a day later.           (AP)

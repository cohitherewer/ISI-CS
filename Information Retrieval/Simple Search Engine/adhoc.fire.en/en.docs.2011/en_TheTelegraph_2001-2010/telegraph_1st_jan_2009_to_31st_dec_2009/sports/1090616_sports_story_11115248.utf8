The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Proteas to save Kallis for semis
                                                   Proteas to save Kallis for semis
            OUR BUREAU                      
	Morne Morkel will replace Jacques Kallis in the South Africa team for Tuesdays ICC World Twenty20 Super Eight match against India at Trent Bridge.         
	The match is effectively a dead rubber as South Africa have already qualified for the semi-finals and India can no longer make the last four stage following their successive defeats to the West Indies and England.         
	It can, however, play a role in deciding whether South Africa finish first or second in Group E. If they finish first, they play the second placed team in Group F at Trent Bridge on Thursday. If they finish second, they play the top placed team in group F at The Oval on Friday. The final is on Sunday at Lords.         
	Jacques has a niggle in the upper region of his back, explained captain Graeme Smith. Jacques could have played on Tuesday but we dont want to take risks and make sure he is ready for our semi-final whether it is on Thursday or Friday.         
	He is two players in one and we have decided to take the bowling option with his replacement. Herschelle Gibbs will open the batting and this allows us to move all our batsmen one place up the order. Some of them are short of batting time in the middle and this should provide the opportunity.         
	Smith said he was also aware of the fact that both West Indies and England had targeted the Indian top order with short pitched bowling and that Morkel was a specialist in this area. As far as we are concerned, nothing has changed in that regard. India have always struggled against quality fast bowling outside the Asian sub-continent.         
	Kallis is currently the leading run scorer in the competition (he also has a strike rate of 129) and his form with the ball has been equally impressive.

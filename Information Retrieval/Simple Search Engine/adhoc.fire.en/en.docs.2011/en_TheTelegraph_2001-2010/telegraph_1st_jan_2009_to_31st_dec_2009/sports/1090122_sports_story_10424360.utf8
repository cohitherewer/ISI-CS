	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan are eyeing full points when they face Mumbai FC in the opening match of the second leg of the ONGC I-League at the Cooperage in Mumbai Friday.         
	According to Jose Ramirez Barreto, the first three matches will be vital in terms of Bagans challenge for the I-League title. The first three matches are very crucial. We need to win all three at any cost if we are to win the I-League. Nine points will be important to take us closer to the title, Barreto said after the clubs training session on Wednesday morning.         
	Optimistic about a positive show against the Mumbai side who on Tuesday beat Mohammedan Sporting 3-0, Barreto said that he would even consider a draw as a negative result. I will consider a draw as a loss. We are going there to win only, the Brazilian said.         
	Incidentally, Mohun Bagan lost 1-2 to Mumbai FC in their first meeting in the league.                     
	Bagan, who have no injury worries however, will miss the services of Rakesh Masih due to a double booking.         
	Following their match against Mumbai FC, Mohun Bagan will take on Air India.         
	Asked how difficult will it be for them to get accustomed to Cooperage, Barreto said: We are not at all worried about playing at the Cooperage. We have played several matches there, and it is quite familiar to us

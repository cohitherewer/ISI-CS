	Johannesburg: Strong contenders Pakistan are expected to have an easy task at hand when they open their Champions Trophy campaign by taking on a depleted West Indies at the Wanderers here Wednesday.         
	But the absence of captain Younis Khan, who has been ruled out with a finger injury, will be a problem for Pakistan. Flamboyant all-rounder Shahid Afridi will lead the side in their opener.         
	Younis suffered a hairline fracture in his right index finger during a warm-up match against Sri Lanka at Benoni three days back.         
	Team sources said that in all likelihood, Younis has been advised a long rest by the doctors for his injury to heal but the team management is keeping the matter under wrap.         
	Although the team management in South Africa have decided to handle Youniss case on a match by match basis, there are strong chances that he might not be able to play in the remaining group matches against India and Australia as well, the source said.         
	His unavailability for the match paves the way for vice-captain Afridi to take on the mantle of leading the one-day side for the first time in his career.         
	However, Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam insisted that the Youniss injury is not very serious.         
	Its a hairline fracture. However the injury is not serious. We hope he will be fit to play against India, he said.         
	Pakistan could not have asked for an easier opponent first up in the eight-nation event as they are eyeing to become only the second team after India to clinch three high profile ICC titles  the World Cup, the World Twenty20 and the Champions Trophy.         
	Completion of dope-tainted pace bowler Mohammed Asifs year-long ban will surely be a welcome news for the Pakistan team management and his inclusion into the squad would only add the necessary sting to their attack.         
	Asif is also raring to prove himself once again in the tournament as he said: I dont think I could get a better platform than the Champions Trophy to make my comeback. And I have always liked bowling on the South African pitches.         
	Alam too said that Asifs return is good news for Pakistan cricket.         
	He is a match-winner. Today (Tuesday) he completes his ban and he then becomes available. Its good for Pakistan that he has made a comeback. The type of bowler that he is, the team is looking forward to have him back, Alam said.         
	However, Pakistan would announce their final eleven Wednesday morning and might not be willing to disturb the team combination to accommodate Asif in the first match.         
	Shahid Afridi, who was instrumental in Pakistans World T20 triumph in England in July, along with the experienced Mohammed Yousuf will be the key men in their batting line-up.         
	On the other hand, a depleted West Indies may find it tough to put up a fight against Pakistan. zWith their regular stars like Chris Gayle, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Shivanaraine Chanderpaul and Dwayne Bravo missing from the squad due to a bitter contractual row between the players and the Board, Floyd Reifer will lead the side.         
	I want the people in the Caribbean to know that this is a West Indies team that is dedicated to the West Indies cricket. This is not a second-string team, Reifer said.         
	But the captains assurance notwithstanding, hardly any miracle is expected from the West Indians, who were humiliated in both the ODI and the Test series in their own backyard at the hands of minnows Bangladesh recently.

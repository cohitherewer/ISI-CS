The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand slips to fifth spot
                                                   Anand slips to fifth spot
                      
	Linares: World Champion Viswanathan Anand played out a draw with Levon Aronian of Armenia and slipped to fifth spot in the ninth round of Magistral Ciudad De Linares Chess tournament here.         
	Anand, having lost to Aronian from a position of strength with white pieces, could do little as black and the game petered out to a draw.         
	Grandmaster Alexander Grischuk remained a full point clear of nearest rivals after settling for a quick draw with Wang Yue of China.         
	The Russian took his tally to an impressive six points out of a possible nine. The second spot is now shared by Magnus Carlsen of Norway, Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine and Aronian, all of who have 5 points each while Anand is a half point adrift of this lot.

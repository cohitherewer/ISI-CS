                                                   North shines in drawn tie
                      
	Worcester: Marcus North slammed an unbeaten 191 as Australia declared for a mammoth 438 for four on the fourth and final day of the warm-up match against the England Lions.         
	The match, which ended in draw, turned out to be an useful one for the Aussies ahead of the first Ashes Test, which begins in Cardiff on Wednesday, as the bowlers too had a fruitful outing.         
	Mitchell Johnson removed both the openers while Brett Lee found some useful reverse swing in the Lions second innings.         
	Play was called off almost an hour early with the England Lions on 162 for four. Opener Joe Denly was the top scorer with 36.               
	BRIEF SCORES: England Lions 352 amp; 162/4. Australia 358 amp; 438/4 decl. (M. North 191 ., M. Clarke 80). Match drawn.           (AGENCIES)

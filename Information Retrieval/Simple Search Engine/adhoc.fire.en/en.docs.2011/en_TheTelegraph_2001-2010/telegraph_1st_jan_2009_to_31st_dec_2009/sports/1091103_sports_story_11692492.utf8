The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Will be a great series: Arthur
                                                                                                                                   Will be a great series: Arthur
                      
	Johannesburg: Englands tour of South Africa is going to be huge believes South Africa coach Mickey Arthur and he has vowed that his charges wont be caught cold as they were in the recent Champions Trophy.         
	Hosts, South Africa, failed to reach the knockout stage of the Champions Trophy, with a defeat against England putting an end to their chances.         
	We were rusty going into that tournament, said Arthur. Any series against England is huge and we want to make sure we are well prepared for our matches against them.         
	England, whose limited overs squad arrived in South Africa Sunday, will be up against South African players who have been playing domestic cricket and will face Zimbabwe in two one-day Internationals before taking on England. England will play South Africa in two Twenty20 Internationals, five ODIs and four Tests.         
	Arthur admitted there may have been some justification for critics who said South Africas predictability had contributed to their Champions Trophy downfall after going into the tournament ranked No. 1 in the world.         
	Things had worked so well for us in one-day cricket that, maybe, we were a bit predictable, he said. We are looking for more flexibility against England.           (AFP)

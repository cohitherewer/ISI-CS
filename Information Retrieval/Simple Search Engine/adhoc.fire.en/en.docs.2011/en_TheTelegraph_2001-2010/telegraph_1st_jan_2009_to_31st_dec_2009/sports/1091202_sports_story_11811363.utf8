	Melbourne: Germany snatched a last-minute goal to down Spain 5-4 in a thrilling contest at the mens field hockey Champions Trophy in Melbourne Tuesday.         
	In later matches, South Korea downed the jet-lagged The Netherlands 2-1 and Australia squeezed past England 2-1.         
	Germany got off with a first-minute bang as Benjamin Wess followed up his own pass to the right and drove home in the circle, redeeming himself for a disqualification in the Germans last game, a 5-3 defeat by South Korea.         
	Jan-Marco Montag flicked a penalty corner conversion four minutes later to give Germany a 2-0 lead.         
	Spain were quick to respond, Albert Sala and Eduard Arbos combining for a right-side challenge to Germanys defence with a last touch by Arbos sending the ball into goal. (AFP)

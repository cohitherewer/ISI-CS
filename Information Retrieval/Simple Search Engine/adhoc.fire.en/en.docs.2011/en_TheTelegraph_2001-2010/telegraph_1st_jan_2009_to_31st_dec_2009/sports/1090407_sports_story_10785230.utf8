The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Three ICL players among Pak probables
                                                   Three ICL players among Pak probables
                      
	Karachi: Mohammed Yousuf was left out but three of his Indian Cricket League (ICL) colleagues were surprisingly picked by the Pakistan selectors on Monday among 30 probables for the Twenty20 World Cup to be held in England this June.         
	Abdul Razzaq, Rana Naved and Imran Nazir, who featured in the rebel league, were included in Pakistans preliminary squad but according to chairman of selectors Abdul Qadir, their final selection will be subject to clearance by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).         
	Let me make it clear that their final selection depends totally on them being cleared by the PCB which is awaiting guidelines from the International Cricket Council (ICC), Qadir said. Naved and Nazir turned out for the Lahore Badshahs while Razzaq played for the Hyderabad Heroes in the ICL.         
	However, the selectors chose to ignore senior batsman Yousuf  he also played for the Badshahs  despite the fact that he was willing to rescind his contract with the ICL.

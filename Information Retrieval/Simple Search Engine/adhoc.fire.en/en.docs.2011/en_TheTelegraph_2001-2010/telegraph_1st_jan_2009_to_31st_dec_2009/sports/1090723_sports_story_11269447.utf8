The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | All-rounder may need artificial knee in 20 years
                                                   All-rounder may need artificial knee in 20 years
            Simon Briggs                      
	Andrew Flintoffs injury is only likely to get worse with each Test he plays in this Ashes series, according to a leading knee surgeon.         
	The cartilage has no capacity to heal itself, and if he is not managed with care, Flintoff could end up needing an artificial joint within 20 years. The damage that Flintoff suffered to his knee during the Indian Premier League (IPL) in April has begun a degenerative process that will be difficult to arrest, according to Derek Bickerstaff. Once the cartilage is damaged, its effectiveness as a shock absorber starts to decline, and small pieces of debris start to cause irritation and swelling.         
	I thought Flintoff was absolutely fantastic at Lords, said Bickerstaff, who has operated on both Simon Jones and Michael Vaughan. But I would advise against everybody getting too excited and thinking that his problem has somehow been solved.         
	The nature of the injury is that it waxes and wanes. All credit to the medical staff, who did some injection therapy to reduce the inflammation. But there is such a short gap between the Edgbaston and Headingley Tests that he will have virtually no rest in between.         
	I know everybody will be disappointed if Flintoff breaks down again, but he only has to catch that sore area the wrong way and it will start to become badly irritated.

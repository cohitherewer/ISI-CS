The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sports minister settles stand-off
                                                   Sports minister settles stand-off
            OUR BUREAU                      
	Calcutta: The Mohun Bagan ground, from Monday, will host two practice sessions  one for their football team in the morning, followed by hockey training in the afternoon.         
	This was decided after state sports minister Subhas Chakraborty intervened and resolved the stand-off between the club and the Bengal Hockey Association (BHA) at a meeting at the Writers Building on Monday.         
	Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra, and BHA secretary Gurbux Singh, who were both present in the meeting, appeared quite satisfied with the decision.         
	Mohun Bagan have misunderstood the whole thing I have told them and the issue is now settled, Chakraborty said after the meeting.         
	Mohun Bagan are playing the I-League and they are now top of the table So they need to practise. They cannot stop doing that. So we have decided that the footballers can practise both in the morning and the evening till Friday. And from Monday onwards, footballers will practise in the morning and the hockey players will practise in the afternoon But if they wish to practise in the evening, they can have the Salt Lake Stadium, he said.         
	Chakraborty said he was unhappy with the present controversy.         
	I dont like what is happening with the grounds. If Mohun Bagan believe the ground belongs to them, then they are wrong. The state government is the custodian of these grounds, and the police commissioner looks after them on behalf of the state government, the minister said.         
	While Chakraborty claimed custodianship for the state government, it is actually the ministry of defence that is in charge of the Maidan. The state government only holds some rights over the law and order.         
	Meanwhile, a second string Mohun Bagan side drew 1-1 with George Telegraph in a practice match.

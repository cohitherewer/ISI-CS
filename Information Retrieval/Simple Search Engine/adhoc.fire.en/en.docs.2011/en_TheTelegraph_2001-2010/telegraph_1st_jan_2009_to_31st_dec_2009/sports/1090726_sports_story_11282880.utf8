                                                   Vijender, Sushil to get top award
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Olympic medallists Vijender Kumar and Sushil Kumar are all set to receive the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award this year along with womens boxing world champion Marykom.         
	According to sources, the sports minister, M.S. Gill on Saturday accepted the recommendations of the Khel Ratna committee to confer the prestigious award on all three sportspersons. A formal announcement would be made in the next few days.         
	Earlier, the Khel Ratna committee, headed by former national table tennis champion Indu Puri, decided to recommend Marykoms name for the top award but also requested the ministry to consider pugilist Vijender and grappler Sushil for the award.         
	Both Vijender and Sushil missed the award last year as it was given to Olympic shooting gold medallist Abhinav Bindra.

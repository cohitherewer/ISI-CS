The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gayle: We have shown character
                                                   Gayle: We have shown character
                      
	Port of Spain: It has been five years since West Indies captain Chris Gayle tasted success in a Test series and after a dramatic draw against England in the final Test on Tuesday, Gayle was unusually effusive.         
	Im really happy, overjoyed. You just have to enjoy the moment, he said after the hosts secured a 1-0 series win.         
	These things dont come around often and I just want to thank each and every player for their efforts and the character they have shown.         
	The skipper was suffering from a hamstring strain he picked up when he completed his first innings hundred. He batted with a runner and faced 42 balls. The hamstring was hurting but it was bearable pain and as you saw I was doing a lot of stretching to try and reach the ball, he said. But I knew I could bear it so it wasnt too much for me.         
	It was a nervy final two hours for the home as they surely sensed their 1-0 lead in the series could slip from their grasp.         
	I had a lot of confidence in the guys but it was pretty tense. Batting in those situations is never easy but I was confident, Gayle said. (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clarke eager to play in IPL 2010
                                                   Clarke eager to play in IPL 2010
                      
	Sydney: He turned down the chance to play in Indian Premier Leagues first two seasons, but Michael Clarke has had a change of heart now and wants to be a part of IPL III to gain experience for his stint as Australias Twenty20 captain.         
	Clarke was appointed captain of Australias Twenty20 team after Ricky Ponting retired from the format following the sides early exit from the T20 World Cup in June. Eager to gain some T20 experience, Clarke said he wants to play in the IPL.         
	There have been reasons why I havent taken part in the last couple of IPLs, Clarke told reporters here.         
	Ive always said that its a competition I would love to take part in at the right time. If the timing is right, if my body is healthy and Im feeling good and a team wants me, it could be a great opportunity to prepare for whats going to be a huge Twenty20 World Cup, he said.         
	Clarke had pulled out of the previous two IPL auctions, citing tight international schedule and family commitments, and the right-hander felt it would be tough to find a team next year.         
	It doesnt matter too much about how much I want to go and play. Teams have to want you as well, Clarke said. The IPL teams might want to buy somebody else, who is available for the whole time, rather than that short period, he explained.         
	Currently out of action due to a nagging back injury, Clarke said he initially considered Twenty20 entertainment but has begun to take the format more seriously now. (PTI)

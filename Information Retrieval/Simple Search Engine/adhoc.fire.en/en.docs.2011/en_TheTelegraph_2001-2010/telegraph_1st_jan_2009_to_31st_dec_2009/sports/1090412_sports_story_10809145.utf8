    - Teams warm up as the second edition of the IPL draws near           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag during a promotional in New Delhi on Saturday. (AFP)                                 
	New Delhi: Virender Sehwags captaincy in the Napier Test may have come in for criticism, but the swashbuckling opener Saturday said he was not unduly bothered by what others had to say about him.         
	With regular captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni skipping the second Test against New Zealand in Napier with a back injury, his deputy Sehwag led India, which the visitors barely managed to draw after following on.         
	Martin Crowe felt Sehwag was a disaster as captain in the match. However, the former New Zealand captain subsequently apologised for being so harsh on the India opener. Sehwag said he was not even aware of the entire episode.         
	In New Zealand, I did not watch television or read newspapers. I wasnt aware that Crowe had criticised my captaincy during the second Test. I only came to know about it from you people.         
	In fact, I dont bother what others think about me. I rather concentrate on what I can do, said Sehwag.         
	Sehwag admitted that it would have been difficult for India to save the Test without the strong performance from opener Gautam Gambhir.         
	I have said it before and I am saying it again  Gautam is the best regular opener after Sunil Gavaskar. He has all the characteristics of a quality opener. His biggest plus point is that he can adjust himself to all formats of the game.         
	In Test matches, Gautam can bat slowly. In one-dayers or in T20 matches, he can score much faster. Thats a great quality, said the Delhi DareDevils captain.         
	Sehwag was interacting with the media during a send-off ceremony at the Kotla ground.         
	Sehwag, who has two triple centuries under his belt in Test matches, said he did not consider himself a full-fledged opener yet.

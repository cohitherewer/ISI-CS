	Goutam Shome Jr was named assistant coach of Bengal for the ensuing Ranji Trophy. Coach Roger Binnys availability for Bengals first Ranji tie against Maharashtra, in Pune from November 3, is doubtful as his mother is unwell. The Cricket Association of Bengal joint secretary Biswarup Dey said Shome would accompany the team to Pune. As it is not sure whether Binny can make it for the first match, we thought it would be wiser to appoint an assistant coach. That way there will be someone to guide the team. Shome was an automatic choice since he is familiar with the team. He had earlier accompanied the team for the JP Atray Memorial meet in Chandigarh.      
	Meanwhile, Bengal physio Chinmoy Roy has been replaced by Sanjib Das, who was in charge of the under-22 team. Chinmoy has been asked to look after the under-22 team. When asked about the swap, Dey said: There are no issues as such. We just felt it necessary. Sources in CAB, though, suggested that Chinmoy was disposed because he was close to the media.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Guwahati: Pune FC held Air India to a 1-1 draw to remain in contention for a semi-final berth in the Hero Honda 31st Federation Cup, here on Thursday.         
	In a Group D match at the Nehru Stadium here, the Air India men were leading 1-0 at half time thanks to 42nd minute strike by Ravinder Singh.         
	He ruffled the net with a beauty of a free-kick from around 30 yards.         
	However, Pune FC, who had shocked Dempo SC 2-1 in their first match, restored parity in the 56th minute through L Jeje.         
	Air India goalkeeper Kunal Sawant could not grip Douhou Pierres free-kick and Jeje who was lurking nearby slotted it home.         
	The first half was lacklustre affair with both sides making hardly any effort to test the rival defence.         
	However, Pune FC started the second half more aggressively and deservedly got the equaliser.         
	Conceding the goal, the Air India side made few positive moves but failed to get the match winner due to poor co-ordination upfront.         
	Pune FC too had their chances but were undone by lack of ideas in front of the goal.         
	The draw actually has thrown Group D wide open. Right now both Pune FC and Lajong have four points each, while Air India have two.         
	On Sunday, they cross swords in a winners-take-it-all clash.         
	If they draw and Air India manage to beat Dempo the goal difference will come into consideration.

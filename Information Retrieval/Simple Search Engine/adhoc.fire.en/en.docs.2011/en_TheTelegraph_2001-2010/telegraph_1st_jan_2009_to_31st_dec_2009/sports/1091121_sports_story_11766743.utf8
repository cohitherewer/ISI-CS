The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cant blame pitch: Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                        Cant blame pitch: Dhoni
  - First test Indian captain admits Lankan spinners were more accurate on placid wicket         OUR CORRESPONDENT            Mahela with the MoM trophy on Friday                                 
	Ahmedabad: Mahendra Singh Dhoni doesnt want to blame the wicket for the dull draw in the opening Test of the series against Sri Lanka. I have seen flatter wickets than this, said the India captain at the post-match press conference.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	The wicket         
	The wicket was quite flat, but I wouldnt say it was the flattest wicket I have seen. I think it was on the slower side, and so wasnt of much help to the spinners. It happens you know.         
	If such pitches are good for the game         
	Everyone tries to make a good wicket. At the end of the day, you just dont know if it will behave in a particular manner. At times, the wickets are too placid. If you leave grass and leave it a bit damp, we have seen that the Test gets over in the first couple of hours. Its very important to maintain the quality. It is a difficult job for the curator. We shouldnt really blame the pitch.         
	If the wicket favoured the fast bowlers         
	For the fast bowlers, too, the wicket got slower and slower.         
	The spinners performance         
	I am satisfied with our spinners. Muttiah Muralidharan was in the opposition and even he didnt get the bounce or turn he is known for. It was difficult for our bowlers to bowl. It was a placid track.         
	If the Sri Lankan spinners bowled better         
	I think our spinners are at par with any side that has good spinners. Of course, we bowled a lot more overs. If anything, the Lankans were more accurate.         
	Kumar Sangakkara saying Sachin Tendulkar wanted to bat in the closing stages         
	Any batsman has the right to achieve a milestone if he is so close to it.         
	Gautam Gambhirs dismissal         
	He bats that way, uses his feet well... Its one of his shots, just that it didnt pay off this time.         
	The positives         
	The bowlers are ready to bowl long spells we bowled 200-odd overs. I dont expect the same to happen in Kanpur.

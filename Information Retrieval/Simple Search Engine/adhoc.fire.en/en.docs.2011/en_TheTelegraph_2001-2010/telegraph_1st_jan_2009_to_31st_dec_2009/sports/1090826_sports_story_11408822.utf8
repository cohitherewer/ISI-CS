	New Delhi: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram Tuesday expressed his eagerness to be associated with the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and said that he was scheduled to meet the IPL franchises owner Shah Rukh Khan on Sunday for a discussion.         
	[That Akram could join the Knight Riders set-up had been reported in Tuesdays edition of The Telegraph.]         
	The former tearaway said he has received a call from Shah Rukhs secretary inviting him for a chat with the Knight Riders on Sunday.         
	I will be there for sure I am keen and I am ready. Check me out, said Akram, who has entered the frame late.         
	I have never done formal coaching before. It is a different skill, which is honed over a period of time. It requires a lot of patience and that is something I have acquired. I came to Delhi to teach bowling skills to youngsters and that was a good experience. So its worth giving a job with the KKR a shot, he told a television broadcaster.         
	As regards the most suitable captain for the Knight Riders, Akrams choice was clear.         
	Ultimately, the management should decide who should lead the side, but according to me, (Sourav) Ganguly is the man. He has been Indias best skipper and is the senior-most member of the side someone who can command the respect of the team, said Akram.         
	Interestingly, former New Zealand captain and ex-India coach John Wright is meeting Shah Rukh on the same day as Akram to explore options for the high-profile job.         
	I will tell him (Shah Rukh) what I am capable of. The rest is his call. He would have surely done his homework. Its great that a non-cricketing man is taking so much interest, Akram said.

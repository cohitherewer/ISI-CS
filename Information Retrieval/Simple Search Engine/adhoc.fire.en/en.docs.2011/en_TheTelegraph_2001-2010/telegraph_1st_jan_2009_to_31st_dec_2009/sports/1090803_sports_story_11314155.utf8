The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lanka look to seal series
                                                   Lanka look to seal series
                      
	Dambulla: Pakistan, having lost two one-sided one-day Internationals (ODI) against Sri Lanka, will try to get things right in the third match of five-match series on Monday.         
	Outclassed in the previous ODIs at the same venue, Pakistan captain Younis Khan will be keen to win his first match of the tour and keep their chances alive.         
	Batting has been the major worry for Pakistan and coach Intikhab Alam may decide to give Imran Nazir and Naved-ul-Hasan, the Indian Cricket League returnees, a chance hoping for an improved show.         
	The failure of Nasir Jamshed at the top of the order should help the team management decide in favour of Nazir while Naved may replace Syed Ajmal with Shahid Afridi and Shoaib Malik handling the spin department.         
	The sorry state of the visitors batting is evident from the fact that bowlers like Umar Gul and Mohammed Amir have turned out to be the top scorers in the previous matches.         
	Kumar Sangakkara-led Sri Lanka, on the other hand, have been in a decent form in this series. A win on Monday will seal the series for the Sri Lankans.         
	Sri Lanka cruised to a 2-0 series lead with a comfortable six-wicket victory against Pakistan in the second ODI on Saturday. Left arm pace bowler Thilan Thushara claimed three wickets as Sri Lanka bowled out Pakistan for a below-par 168 in 47 overs.         
	Thusharas form has been a major boost for the islanders. He had picked up three for 29 in the first match as well and has continuously troubled the Pakistan top order.         
	The hosts were guided home on Saturday by middle order batsman Chamara Kapugedera, who top-scored with a stylish 67 not out from 97 balls with eight fours and one six. (Agencies)

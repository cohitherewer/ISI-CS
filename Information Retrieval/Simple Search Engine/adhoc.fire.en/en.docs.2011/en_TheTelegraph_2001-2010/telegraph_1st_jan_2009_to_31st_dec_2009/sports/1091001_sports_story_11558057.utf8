The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zuma: Our crime is abnormal 
                                                   Zuma: Our crime is abnormal 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Johannesburg: Just over a week ago, in response to a question from The Telegraph in Zurich, Fifa president Joseph Blatter had said there was no reason to worry over security in South Africa during the 2010 World Cup.         
	Lets trust the South Africans. I really dont know why I keep getting asked about security, hed added.         
	Even if Blatter isnt worried, South Africas President, Jacob Zuma, is. Of course, in a general context and not specific to next years World Cup.         
	So much so that Zuma has favoured the use of lethal force, as media reports have put it, against violent criminals. Accordingly, the Criminal Procedure Act will soon be amended.         
	Known to talk straight, Zuma (who became President some months ago) made his views public while addressing around 1,000 police station commissioners, from across South Africa, on Tuesday.               
	The following are excerpts from his speech                 
	Crime in South Africa is not the normal crime, ours is said to be violent... We are dealing with a different crime, its abnormal. It, therefore, needs extraordinary measures...         
	Are criminals having that rule (referring to the police having to first fire a warning shot when faced with armed criminals)? Have criminals ever taken a gun out, when faced with the police, and fired a warning shot?         
	We need to understand this very tricky situation. Once criminals take out guns, they shoot, thats a reality. And, once a police (officer) is trying to warn, fire a warning shot, hes dead. Thats also a reality...         
	We are dealing with citizens who are insecure... We can do everything, we can even have a performing economy, but if people dont have the time to enjoy, as they are afraid of being killed, then its not profitable. Safety of the people is very important.         
	Clearly, Blatter needs to review the security arrangements in much greater detail.

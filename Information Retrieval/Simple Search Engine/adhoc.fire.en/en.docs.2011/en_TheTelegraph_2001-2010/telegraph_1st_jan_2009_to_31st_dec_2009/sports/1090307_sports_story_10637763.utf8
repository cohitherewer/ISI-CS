	Calcutta: Call it the downturn effect or whatever, the sponsors arent flocking to the International Cricket Councils World Twenty20 meet in England in June.         
	The ICC has announced it is seeking local partner sponsors for the World Twenty20 meet. Three sponsorship positions are available for the event that features, for the first time, mens and womens tournaments running alongside each other.         
	Local partners for the ICC World Twenty20 would join the ICCs already-existent list of sponsors that receive exclusive rights and benefits from its portfolio of international cricket events. The existing sponsors include Pepsico, Reliance Communications, LG Electronics, Emirates, Reebok and Yahoo!

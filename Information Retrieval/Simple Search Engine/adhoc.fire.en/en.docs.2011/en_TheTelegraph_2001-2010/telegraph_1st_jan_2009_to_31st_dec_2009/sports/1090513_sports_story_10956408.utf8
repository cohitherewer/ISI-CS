                                                     Better being a cheerleader?
    - Strange that Buchanan hasnt deemed it fit to give Mortaza even one game           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mashrafe Mortaza                                 
	Calcutta: Tuesdays defeat confirmed what had become evident early in the tournament  that the Kolkata Knight Riders neither had the ammo nor the drive to make at least the semi-finals of IPL 2009.         
	The inaugural season, last year, had seen the franchise finish sixth. This time, the Knights have been monopolising the absolute bottom of the eight-team table.         
	Poor man management, beginning with the shoddy manner in which icon Sourav Ganguly was sacked as captain, apart, the resources just havent been utilised in the best manner.         
	Not that the most exciting exponents of T20 pack the Knights dressing room. Indeed, there are quite a few very average cricketers wearing the black and gold colours.         
	To talk of the talent available, its strange (if not shocking) that John Buchanan hasnt deemed it fit to give Bangladeshs premier strike bowler, Mashrafe Mortaza, even one game.         
	Eleven have gone and the line-up for the last match, against the Royal Challengers Bangalore, saw as many as four changes. Not that the chopping and changing worked.         
	The treatment meted out to Mortaza lends credence to whispers that Buchanan, who heads the franchises cricket operations, didnt exactly want him in the squad and that principal owner Shah Rukh Khan had intervened during this years auction.         
	Apparently, one reason for signing Mortaza was to extend the Knights appeal in Bangladesh, which isnt much more than a stones throw away from the franchise-city. If anything, folks there must be rather furious.         
	The 25-year-old right-arm quick, who is a handy bat too, is understood to be cut up. Frustrated as well. With perfectly legitimate reasons.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, the other day, Mortaza told a confidant: Cheerleader howa hi bhalo hoto... That way, I would have been doing something... Boshe ki hoye?         
	The Bangladesh captain, batsman Mohammed Ashraful, is probably in the same state of mind: He hasnt made the XI in any of the Mumbai Indians 11 games. The Sachin Tendulkar-led team has, however, been winning.         
	Like Mortaza, Ashraful was bought at the last auction, for two seasons.         
	Mortaza went for a whopping $600,000, thanks to a rather bizarre bidding war between the Knights and the Kings XI Punjab, where Preity Zinta has a big stake.         
	For whatever reason, Shah Rukh didnt want to come off second best and that was made clear to his men at the auction table in Goa.         
	Ashraful, incidentally, came cheap for the Mukesh Ambani-owned Mumbai Indians. The franchise paid no more than $75,000.         
	While just about everybody else has, among other things, been getting invaluable exposure in the lead-up to next months World T20, the Mortazas have been getting rusty.         
	Nothing worse could happen to a professional.         
	Footnote: Given the Knights disgraceful run, the franchise may end the edition without a single outright win. The one victory so far, in the first match against the Kings XI, came via the Duckworth-Lewis Method.

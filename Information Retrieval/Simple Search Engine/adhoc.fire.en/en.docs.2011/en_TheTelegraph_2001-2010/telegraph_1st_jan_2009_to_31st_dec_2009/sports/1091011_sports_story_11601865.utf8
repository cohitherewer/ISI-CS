The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Arktouros upstages Talent
                                                                                                               Arktouros upstages Talent
            STAR RACER      
	Calcutta: Punters cried foul, so did old timers and knowledgeable racegoers following the narrow victory of a less-fancied Arktouros over an equally long-priced runner, Bountiful Talent, in Saturdays main attraction, the 2,000m Monsoon Cup. Form went haywire in the race as the fancied runners like Colourful Lady and Succeeding Star performed miserably. Arktouros was taken to the front by jockey C. Alford, and none among the field, barring Bountiful Talent, displayed recent form.RESULTS

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Milan not giving up 
                                                     Milan not giving up 
                  Beckham                     
	Milan: AC Milan still hope to sign David Beckham from Los Angeles Galaxy permanently and view the deadline imposed for a deal by Major League Soccer (MLS) as a tactic, chief executive Adriano Galliani said on Saturday.         
	The England midfielder, on loan to Milan until March 9, has said he wants to stay at the Serie A club but the Friday deadline passed without agreement. Galaxy have said they now expect him to return next month.         
	In the meantime Beckham is here at Milan, well see what happens in a month or so, Galliani said.         
	Its a tactic, he added when asked about the deadline.         
	Italian media speculated that a deal could still be reached by the parties irrespective of the arbitrary deadline set by MLS during the week.         
	Beckham is set to play in his first derby against Serie A leaders Inter Milan at the San Siro on Sunday and coach Carlo Ancelotti hopes it will not be his last.         
	I cannot know if it will be Beckhams last derby, Ancelotti told a news conference on Saturday. My hope is that he can play lots more with the same shirt. At the moment hes an indispensable player for Milan.         
	Beckhams spokesman said the player and his advisors would consider their position after the Inter game.         
	David is focused on the Milan derby this Sunday. We will be addressing this early next week, Simon Oliveira said.         
	Beckham has the option of buying out his contract and has a clause which says he can leave Galaxy in October.           (REUTERS)

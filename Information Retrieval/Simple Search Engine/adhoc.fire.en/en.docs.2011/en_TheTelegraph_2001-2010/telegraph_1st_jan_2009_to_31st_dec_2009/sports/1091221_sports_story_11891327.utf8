The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sanath future looks bleak
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sanath future looks bleak
  - THIRD ODI Loss of key players doesnt worry the Sri Lanka captain         OUR CORRESPONDENT            Sachin Tendulkar (from left), Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir during a practice session at the Barabati Stadium, in Cuttack, on Sunday                                 
	Cuttack: The issue of dealing with iconic senior players is a sensitive one in the subcontinent.         
	Sourav Ganguly had to do that unenviable job when he dropped Anil Kumble from the playing XI during the 2003 World Cup in South Africa, or when he made Rahul Dravid keep wickets, so that India got their combination right.         
	Rahul Dravid faced a similar problem when Sourav Ganguly was brought back into the Indian team after being out for a long time.         
	Now, it is Kumar Sangakkaras turn. He has to deal with the senior-most player in the team, Sanath Jayasuriya.         
	It is never easy to drop somebody who has 13,382 runs in one-day Internationals, including 28 centuries.         
	The 40-year-old was dropped from the Lankan XI for the last match in Nagpur.         
	In Sangakkaras words on Sunday, there is clear enough indication that Lankans are trying to look ahead.         
	Its always difficult to drop a legend like Sanath. But we need to look ahead for the countrys sake. It was hard to fit him in the line-up and we had to take a hard decision, the Lankan captain said on the eve of the third ODI.         
	How is the Matara dasher coping up with the team managements decision to drop him? Well, its up to him as how he accepts it. But I believe there are times when youve got to be direct in your approach.         
	Sometimes it may be subtle. Some may take it well and some may not like it, but thats how it is. Its about whether the particular person is fitting into the scheme of things. But your way of dealing should be direct and honest, Sangakkara said.

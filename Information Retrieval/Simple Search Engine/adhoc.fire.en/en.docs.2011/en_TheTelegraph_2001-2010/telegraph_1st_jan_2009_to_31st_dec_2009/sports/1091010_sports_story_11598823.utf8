The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 3 veterans on selectors radar
                                                     3 veterans on selectors radar
  - Seven-match One-day series vs Australia         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      Ajit Agarkar, Sreesanth and Munaf Patel                                   
	Calcutta: Three 26-plus medium-pacers, including 31-year-old Ajit Agarkar, are being talked about by the senior national selectors.         
	Munaf Patel and Sreesanth are the other two.         
	A well-placed source of The Telegraph confirmed that as no young new-ball bowler had made an impression in the 2009-10 season, which formally got under way with the October 1-5 Irani Trophy in Nagpur, Krishnamachari Srikkanth and his colleagues were looking at recalling one of the veterans.         
	The selectors focus is on the seven-match ODI series against world champions Australia, between October 25-November 11.         
	Agarkars last India appearance, in a T20 International, was in September 2007. As for the injury-prone Sreesanth, he hasnt worn the India cap after March 2008 (Kanpur Test, against South Africa). Munafs last India appearance was in New Zealand this year.         
	Except Ashish Nehra, nobody did well upfront in the Champions Trophy and, with Zaheer Khan still unfit, the selectors may just fall back on one of the more experienced guys, the source said.         
	He added: Young (22-year-old) Sudeep Tyagi definitely has the potential, but he hasnt done anything to strongly press for a call -up... It seems hell have to wait and, first, get consistent.         
	Of the three, Agarkar is the oldest, but appears to have caught the selectors eye during the Irani Trophy, when he picked up three Rest wickets in the first innings.         
	Eleven-and-a-half years after his India debut, Agarkar looks to be the dark horse, behind the other two.         
	Both regular Ishant Sharma and the in-and-out Rudra Pratap Singh were particularly disappointing in the Champions Trophy (with India again failing to make the semi-finals), but the selectors could persist with the younger Ishant as dropping him may lead to his confidence sinking to a dangerous low.         
	Frankly, the cupboard is rather bare, so the selectors cant afford to play around with Ishants confidence, which has already dipped, the source pointed out.         
	Not very convincing that, but the selectors are supposed to know best.         
	Incidentally, four selectors  Yashpal Sharma, Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave and Raja Venkat  are watching the ongoing Challenger Trophy in Nagpur.         
	Chief selector Srikkanth is, at the moment, busy with preparations for son Adithyaas wedding on October 21.         
	Two days remain for the Challenger Trophy to end. Its to be seen whether the selectors move closer to bringing back one from among the three being talked about or (and that would be interesting) start looking at somebody else.         
	For now, the squad for the first two/three ODIs is likely to be picked on October 15.

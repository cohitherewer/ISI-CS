The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | East Bengal up against a confident Vasco SC
                                                     East Bengal up against a confident Vasco SC
            A STAFF REPORTER            Yakubu                           
	Calcutta: East Bengal will have to raise their game a few notches if they harbour any hopes of garnering full points against a buoyant Vasco Sports Club in a 15th round match of the I-League in Margao on Saturday.         
	If the red-and-gold brigades campaign in the ongoing I-League has gone from bad to worse  they took just 17 points from 14 matches  there is suddenly a spring in Vasco steps.         
	And that comes from the fact that they have remained unbeaten in the second leg of the league. Five points from three matches in the second leg, which include a win against Sporting Clube de Goa, is not a bad start for Elvis Goess boys.         
	They now have 10 points from 14 matches and are dreaming of beating the drop.         
	Agrees Subhas Bhowmick: They are on a roll and have become one of the most improved sides. We have to be very cautious. Subhas is yet to decide on who should partner Mehrajuddin Wadoo in central defence.         
	There will be a toss-up between M. Suresh and Suleh Musah, and Subhas is holding his cards close to his chest.         
	East Bengal will welcome the fact that Vascos man-in-form, Lester Fernandes, is out of Saturdays skirmish with a double booking.         
	Fernandes has played a big role in Vascos resurgence with his mobility in the midfield.         
	Its a blow for us but going by present form I dont think his absence will be felt much.         
	Our team is oozing with confidence and the boys know they can beat any team if they play to their strength, coach Goes said.         
	East Bengal are struggling to find their feet and we will definitely capitalise on that, Goes added.         
	In the first leg, East Bengal, then under Stanley Rozario, had recorded a convincing 2-0 win over Vasco.         
	And the man who orchestrated it, Yusif Yakubu, would like an encore. Yakubu and Sunil Chetri forge a dangerous combination upfront for East Bengal but somehow results havent been coming.         
	 Even luck hasnt been with them the woodwork denying Chetri with time and again. Who knows, Saturday can be the beginning.         
	East Bengals main problem has been their brittle defence. In the match against Air India, which they won 3-1 at home last Saturday, the back-four was so porous that the Mumbai outfit came close to scoring at least twice in the first half.         
	We cant afford to be lax in defence, Wadoo, a vital cog in the East Bengal wheel said.         
	If the defence continues to be as porous as it has been, Vasco will not let it go easily. After all they are the team in form and Goas most popular club has never been short of vocal support. Ask Clube or Mohun Bagan, they will vouch for it.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Barreto may play in CFL
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto may return to action when Mohun Bagan take on Mohammedan AC in a CFL Premier Division match on December 11.         
	Barreto, who is nursing a hamstring injury, has been out of action since October 25 when he limped out during Mohun Bagans I-League derby against East Bengal. Coach Karim Bencharifa wants to have a look at his star striker before the start of the Federation Cup, which is to be held in Guwahati and Silchar.         
	He needs some real-time action before Fed Cup and he may play for 30 minutes against Mohammedan AC.         
	We have also lined up a couple of practice matches to see how Barreto is shaping up, Bencharifa said at the club tent on Wednesday.         
	Expressing happiness over Ryuji Sueokas performance against Peerless on Wednesday, Bencharifa said that the Japanese is getting used to the conditions.         
	He is doing well and we are hopeful of more such performances from him, he said.

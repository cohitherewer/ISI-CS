	Sarfraz advice
    Karachi: Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar, who has been withdrawn from squad for the World Twenty20 meet due to a skin infection, should try and shed weight if he wants to prolong his international career, feels former skipper Sarfraz Nawaz
    I think he has created problems for himself. I think he has another year of international cricket left in him but for that he has to shed weight and work hard. The problem is that there is too much emphasis on gym training for bowlers and as a result while the upper body of the bowlers is strong their legs are weak and they constantly face fitness problems, said Sarfraz.         
	Meanwhile, Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam said Rao Iftikhar will be a good replacement for Shoaib.                     
	Hughes rsquo; view
    Sydney: Australia batsman Phillip Hughes arrived home from a successful few weeks in England on Friday and said he could not wait to get right back on the plane to Europe for his first Ashes series.
    The 20-year-old, who spent a month playing for English county side Middlesex, said: The experience had whetted his appetite for Australias defence of the Ashes, which begins on July 8. I thoroughly enjoyed it and the preparation has been great to be honest, Hughes said.         
	I think the big thing that came out of it was that I played at three test grounds Im going to be playing on, he added.           A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES

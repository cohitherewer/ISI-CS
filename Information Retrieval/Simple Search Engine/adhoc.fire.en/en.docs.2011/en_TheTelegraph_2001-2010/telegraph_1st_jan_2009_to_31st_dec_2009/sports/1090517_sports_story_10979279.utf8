                                                     Safina sets up final against Wozniacki

	Madrid: World No. 1 Dinara Safina overcame erratic form to beat unseeded Swiss Patty Schnyder 6-4, 6-2 in the semi-finals of the Madrid Open on Saturday.         
	After her success in Rome last week, the 23-year-old Russian is bidding for a second consecutive claycourt title and will play ninth seed Caroline Wozniacki in Sundays final.         
	The Danish 18-year-old earlier powered to a 7-6(7-1), 6-3 victory over former World No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo to clinch a place in her fourth final of the year. Safina broke the Schnyder serve to love in the opening game in the sunshine in the new Magic Box stadium in the Spanish capital and raced to a 3-0 lead.         
	Schnyder broke back immediately as errors started to appear in Safinas game but the Russian ultimately had too much power for the 30-year-old and three more breaks had her serving for the match at 5-2 in the second set.         
	She wrapped up victory on her second match point when Schnyder sent a forehand return wide.         
	When you keep winning you dont even feel that you are tired, Safina said at a press conference.         
	Im looking forward to Sundays match and then I can have a little rest before the French Open.         
	Safina, who took over the top spot from Serena Williams last month, had her best result in Roland Garros last year when she reached the final but lost to Serbian Ana Ivanovic. She also lost the 2009 Australian Open final to Serena in January.         
	Safina said she was not feeling the pressure ahead of the tournament in Paris which starts at the end of this month.         
	Until now Im coming pretty comfortable to the tournaments since Im No. 1 so I wouldnt complain, she said.Ive played three finals so it couldnt be better.         
	Mauresmo, twice a grand slam winner, missed a chance to serve out the first set against Wozniacki earlier on Saturday and faded badly in the tie-break to lose it 7-1.         
	The pair swapped breaks at the start of the second set before the Dane stepped up a gear in the sixth game to break again for a 4-2 lead.         
	Mauresmo saved one match point with a typically elegant backhand winner but went long with a forehand on the next one to put Wozniacki through.         
	It was a tight one, a good fight, she made me play every time an extra shot, Mauresmo, 29, said. I wish I could have had a little bit more energy to make the difference out there. After quite a busy week for me its a little bit frustrating to come up short physically but thats how it is.

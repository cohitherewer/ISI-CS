The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fletcher joins the queue
                                                   Fletcher joins the queue
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Ashes-winning coach Duncan Fletcher on Sunday emerged as a surprise contender for Kolkata Knight Riders coaching job.         
	The former Zimbabwe captain and England coach presented his case to the Knights management at principal owner Shah Rukh Khans residence while on a whirl-wind visit to the country.         
	Besides Fletcher, former England all-rounder Dermot Reeve, former South Africa coach Eric Simons and ex-India international Woorkeri Raman also made their presentations on the second consecutive day of interviews.         
	Interestingly, former South African player and Pakistan coach Richard Pybus, who had met the KKR officials on Saturday, stayed back for a second round of interaction. It seems he might have gained an edge over the other contenders.         
	Knights captain in the inaugural edition of the IPL, Sourav Ganguly, who was not part of the interviewing panel on Saturday, was also present Sunday, as was also Juhi Chawla. The candidates, not surprisingly, preferred to keep their cards close to their chest.         
	I would like to coach an Indian team to success, but wouldnt want to say anything more now, Reeve told The Telegraph.         
	It wouldnt be appropriate for me to make a comment at this point of time, Fletcher said.         
	Australian Michael Bevan, former India players Lalchand Rajput and Ashok Malhotra, besides Pybus, were interviewed on Saturday.         
	Former New Zealand captain and Team India coach John Wright is expected to meet the KKR management later this week.

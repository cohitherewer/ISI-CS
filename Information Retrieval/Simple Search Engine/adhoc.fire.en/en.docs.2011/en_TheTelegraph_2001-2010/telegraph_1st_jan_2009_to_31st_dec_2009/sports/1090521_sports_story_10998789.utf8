                                                French court rejects Ferrari bid  Paris: A French court Wednesday dismissed Ferrari rsquo;s bid to stop Formula One from instituting a budget cap next season.

The Italian team rsquo;s lawyers said F1 was in danger of becoming a two-tier championship if budget caps were applied and that, with 700 employees worldwide, Ferrari is unable to reduce its budget significantly in such a short time.

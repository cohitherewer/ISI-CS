The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sehwag creates a flutter
                                                   Sehwag creates a flutter
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The cricketing fraternity was thrown into a tizzy on Monday after Virender Sehwag, alleging corruption and interference in selection matters, threatened to quit the Delhi Ranji Trophy team.         
	The flamboyant India opener, who is currently out of the capital, however, chose to remain silent after his reported outburst against a section of the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) officials on Sunday.         
	Senior DDCA officials, however, were confident that the matter would be solved amicably after a discussion with the ace batsman.         
	Sehwag is apparently upset with the DDCA sports committee that has a major say in selection matters of the state teams at all levels. The star opener has also complained to Arun Jaitley, president of the DDCA.         
	DDCA sports secretary Sunil Dev said he was ready to have a dialogue with Sehwag.         
	Sehwag is a great batsman, we cannot let him go like this, said Dev. I am sure we will be able to convince him to stay with Delhi. But all said and done, Sehwag should not have gone to the media to talk against the association.         
	Dev, however, said neither has he received any communication from Sehwag nor has he been approached for a No Objection Certificate to play for some other state.         
	Meanwhile, Haryana Cricket Association has confirmed that they were ready to offer Sehwag a place in their Ranji side in case he decides to move out of Delhi.

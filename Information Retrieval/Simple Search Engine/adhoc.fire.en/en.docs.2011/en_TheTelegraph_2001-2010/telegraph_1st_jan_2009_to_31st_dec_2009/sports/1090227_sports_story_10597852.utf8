The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A challenge: Tiwary
                                                   A challenge: Tiwary
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Manoj Tiwary on Thursday said he was looking forward to the challenge of leading East Zone in the Deodhar Trophy.         
	It is a challenge even though captaincy is not new to me. I am thankful to the selectors for keeping faith in me and my leadership abilities. I will have to live up to their expectations, Tiwary told The Telegraph.         
	Asked whether it came as a surprise since he hadnt led the state side, Tiwary said: My job is not to look into all these things. It will be my responsibility to bring all the players together in the team and form a cohesive unit. That is the basic job of a leader.         
	I have been playing in the zonal side for the past few years and have observed a few things which I think should be addressed properly to enhance the performance of the team. There are some aspects in which the East Zone sides have been found wanting in the past, explained Tiwary.         
	He however, refused to comment on the squad, saying: The selectors have done their job and I have no issues about it.         
	Speaking on captaincy, Tiwary said: Ive always enjoyed captaincy. I have led under-19 sides and wont be under any pressure. In fact, if you check the statistics you will find that I have performed better whenever I have been the captain of the side.         
	Laxmi Ratan Shukla also seemed a happy man.         
	I am very happy with my selection in the East Zone side. I am also happy for Manoj since he has been named the captain. Its great that someone from Bengal has been selected captain. It is the decision of the selectors and I have nothing to say on that, said the all-rounder.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Venkat admits Saha best but has to wait
                                                     Venkat admits Saha best but has to wait
  - War of words between CAB president and East Zone selector at working committee       A STAFF REPORTER    
	Calcutta: East Zone selector Raja Venkat Saturday admitted on the floor of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB)s working committee meeting that Bengals Wriddhiman Saha is currently the best wicketkeeper in the country, even better than Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	However, for reasons beyond his control, Saha would have to wait.         
	First, because Dhoni is the Team India captain, and second, the current No.2 wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik has made the most of his comeback, earlier this year.         
	Venkat, who represented Ballygunge Sporting in the first meeting of the newly-formed working committee, was responding to CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiyas enquiry as to why Wriddhiman, despite being in top form, was still out of favour with the national selectors.         
	Raja (Venkat) admitted at the meeting that Wriddhiman was currently the best wicketkeeper in the country Even better than Dhoni, CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey told The Telegraph.         
	The national selector and Dalmiya have been engaged in a war of words ever since the CAB president told a TV channel that Venkat was more of a Tamil Nadu selector than a selector from East.         
	During the course of Saturdays meeting Venkat told Dalmiya he did not like being called a Tamil Nadu selector and that he was trying hard to get Wriddhiman into the national side.         
	Raja added that Ranadeb Bose could not get into the team because age was not on his side. Balaji, a much younger bowler, thus made his way into the national squad.         
	Dalmiya, however, cited the example of Farokh Engineer getting selected ahead of Budhi Kunderan although the latter had scored more runs. The president went on to say that a selector should push a player who was in top-form into the national squad.         
	Also at the meeting, former assistant secretary Sujan Mukherjee questioned Vece Paess appointment as the performance manager despite having problems adjusting with the players and the coach in the past.         
	Paes was with the Bengal squad when Woorkeri Raman was the coach. Raman, it is believed, had problems with the way Paes functioned.

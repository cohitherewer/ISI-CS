	London: Greece, Switzerland, Slovakia and Slovenia will fight to fill Europes two remaining automatic spots for next years World Cup when they play in the final round of qualifying Wednesday.         
	With seven of the continents nine qualifying groups already won, Greece and Switzerland each have the chance to top Group Two, while Slovenia and Slovakia are playing for first place in Group Three.         
	The Swiss look most likely to join Denmark, Germany, Spain, England, Serbia, Italy and the Netherlands at the tournament in South Africa, with just a point needed against visiting Israel.         
	Greece should get the win it requires over Luxembourg but also needs Israel to grab a shock win in Basel.         
	Portugal, who can only make it through the playoffs, will have to capture the same without Cristiano Ronaldo.         
	Portugal moved up to second place behind Denmark in Group One on Saturday with a 3-0 victory over Hungary. Now comes what should be a routine victory at home to Malta to secure the runners-up spot that guarantees a place in the playoffs.         
	But Ronaldo, the worlds most expensive star and the Fifa Player of the Year, wont be in Guimaraes to help his teammates.         
	The Swiss had hoped to reach next years finals in South Africa Saturday after they returned home from Luxembourg with a 3-0 victory.         
	But they were held up by Greeces spectacular 5-2 come-from-behind victory over Latvia and, still with a three-point lead, now need to avoid losing at home to Israel on Wednesday.         
	Slovakia blew a chance to qualify for the first time by losing 0-2 at home to Slovenia in Group Three on Saturday.         
	Meanwhile, Steven Gerrard will miss Englands final qualifying match against Belarus at Wembley on Wednesday after limping out of training Tuesday.         
	Fabio Capello confirmed the Liverpool captain had been sent back to his club to have his troublesome groin injury assessed.           (AP)

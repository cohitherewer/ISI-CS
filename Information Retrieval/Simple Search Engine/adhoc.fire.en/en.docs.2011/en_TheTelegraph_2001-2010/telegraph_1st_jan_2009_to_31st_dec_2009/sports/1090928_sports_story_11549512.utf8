The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barcelona maintain winning run
                                                   Barcelona maintain winning run
                      
	Madrid: Barcelona and Real Madrid maintained their perfect La Liga starts on Saturday, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic setting the champions on their way to a 2-0 victory at Malaga and Real winning 3-0 at home to Tenerife.         
	Real made it five wins out of five thanks to a Karim Benzema double and a sublime curler from Kaka and lead with 15 points, ahead of Barca on goal difference.         
	Sevilla, who won 4-0 at Athletic Bilbao, are third on 12, while substitute Maxi Rodriguez struck in added time to earn struggling Atletico Madrid a 2-2 draw at Valencia.         
	Ibrahimovic needed just 10 minutes to score his fifth goal in five games after coming off the bench for the injured Thierry Henry in the 29th minute of a bad-tempered clash.         
	It was a very aggressive match that took a lot out of us, Barca coach Pep Guardiola told a news conference. Asked whether the La Liga campaign was already a two-horse race between Barca and Real, he added: Madrid has economic might but we have too and the players make the difference.         
	In Italy, Sampdoria sank champions Inter Milan 1-0 with a second-half Giampaolo Pazzini goal to go top of Serie A.         
	Inter are in second spot two points further back and alongside Fiorentina after they won 1-0 at Livorno with a 76th-minute penalty by Stevan Jovetic. Juventus, also on 13 points, will go solo at the summit on 16 points if they beat Bologna at home on Sunday.

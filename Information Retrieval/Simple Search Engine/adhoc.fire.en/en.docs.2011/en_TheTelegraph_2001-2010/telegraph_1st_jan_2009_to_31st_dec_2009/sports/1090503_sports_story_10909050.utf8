	Jean-Paul Duminys quality came to the fore once again on Friday when his dazzling 52 off 37 balls turned out to be the deciding factor in the Mumbai sides 11-run victory over the Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League. The elegant left-hander from South Africa, popularly known as JP, hit four massive sixes in his crucial innings. With star openers Sachin Tendulkar and Sanath Jayasuriya dismissed within the eighth over and his side struggling at 54 for three, JP took charge and helped the Mumbai side to their total of 148.

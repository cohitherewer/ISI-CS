The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Secret Whispers for Army Cup
                                                                                                               Secret Whispers for Army Cup 
            STAR RACER                                
	Calcutta: Of the 10 horses in the line-up for the 1,400m Army Cup on Friday, Accardo, Formal Affair Secret Whispers and Suits Me have the credentials to land the trophy. Form and looks favour the H.S. Bath-trained Secret Whispers who had placed close behind Xray in his maiden start. Trainer Vijay Singh pair of Accardo and Formal Affair are looking improved since its educational run. Daniel David also has a potential runner in Suits Me who had gone easy in her privious race, won by Generous Thought. The fact that Thought had finished way behind Secret Whispers in her earlier outing, may tilt scales in favour of the Bath-trainee.

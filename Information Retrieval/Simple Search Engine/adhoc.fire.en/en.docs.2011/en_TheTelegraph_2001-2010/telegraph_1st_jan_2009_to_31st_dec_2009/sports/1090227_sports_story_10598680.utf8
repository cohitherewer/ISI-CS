                                                     Tiwary to lead East, Shukla in squad

	Calcutta/Guwahati: Manoj Tiwary will lead East Zone in the Deodhar Trophy starting March 13 in Cuttack. Tiwary was chosen ahead of his senior statemate and Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla during a stormy selection committee meeting in Guwahati.         
	Bengal selection committee chairman Sambaran Banerjee wanted Shukla as captain, but the other four zonal selectors along with Raja Venkat, national selector and chairman of the zonal selection committee, voted for Tiwary.         
	Banerjee, Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) representative, however, made his reservations official, and his views were recorded in the minutes of the meeting.         
	CABs Banerjee had proposed the name of Shukla as the Bengal one-day team had done well under him Shukla has also been in good nick. As there was some reservation, I asked the members to spell out their choice. Representatives from Assam, Tripura, Orissa and Jharkhand along with Venkat pitched for Tiwary. The general consensus was that Tiwary was in good nick and in contention for a berth in the senior India team, Assam Cricket Association (ACA) secretary and East Zone convenor Bikash Baruah said.         
	Banerjee argued that Bengal had performed creditably under Shukla this season and Tiwary should not be burdened with captaincy at a critical point of his career and be allowed to play freely. The convenor, however, went with the majority.         
	BCCI politics also played its part. The majority went with Raja Venkat to show their loyalty towards the current men in power, said a source.         
	The other players were picked on the basis of their performances in the recently concluded East Zone leg of the Vijay Hazare Trophy in Calcutta. Tiwary would be assisted by Saurabh Tiwary of Jharkhand.         
	However, there was no debate over Shuklas inclusion in the squad. Earlier this season, he had failed to find a place in the East Zone Duleep Trophy squad. The conditioning camp will be in Cuttack from March 11. Samir Dighe will be the coach.

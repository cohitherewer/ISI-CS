The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dropped catches hurt: Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dropped catches hurt: Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nagpur: After being comprehensively beaten by Sri Lanka in the first Twenty20 International here Wednesday, India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said his team gave away too many runs after starting well in the match.         
	We started well and had given away only 16 to 18 runs in the first four overs. Both Ishant Sharma and Ashish Nehra began well But then, to give away 200-odd runs in the next 16 overs cost us the match, said Dhoni after his team fell short by 29 runs.         
	Dhoni conceded that Sri Lanka outplayed his side who came into the tie after being crowned as the worlds top Test team following their 2-0 Test series victory.         
	We were outplayed in this game. (Kumar) Sangakkara played brilliantly and carried on till the end. We also dropped a few catches.         
	We are not one of the best fielding sides in the world, but we are also not known to drop too many catches.         
	Of course, the dropped catches hurt us in the match. We could have done better and had we restricted them to around 190 it could have been different, he said.         
	He said that the middle order failed to get going after the brisk start given by openers Gautam Gambhir, who top scored with a fine 55, and Virender Sehwag, who made a 14-ball 26.         
	The middle order failed But the asking rate had climbed up and we had to go for the shots. Unfortunately they went to hand. Both Yuvraj (Singh) and I got out that way, he pointed out.         
	Dhoni defended his decision to field first on winning the toss and said he decided so because the performance of his bowlers in the death overs had not been good in the recent past.         
	We felt the wicket was good for the entire match and we did not want to put pressure on the bowlers.         
	In Twenty20 games, things change during the slog phase from the 12 or 13 overs onwards and our bowlers have been struggling at the death.         
	But we could have done better in the field and not conceded two boundaries every over after the good beginning, he said.         
	He did not think his slow bowlers  Pragyan Ojha and Yusuf Pathan  paled in comparison to Sanath Jayasuriyas display, despite the fact that the two Indian bowlers conceded over 80 runs combined in six overs while the Lanka veteran got two for 19 from his four.         
	Speaking about their not-so-impressive show of late in the T20s, Dhoni said: Unfortunately we are not being able to get into the groove when we play Twenty20s before an ODI series. We made the mistake of taking them (T20 matches) as warm-up games before the one day matches.         
	Dhonis counterpart, Sangakkara, said the win would boost the morale of the players before the ODI series.         
	Of course, we will start from the scratch in the one-day series, but a win always makes you happy. We would want to carry on the momentum in the next Twenty20 match (at Mohali), he said.         
	Describing the victory as a team effort, Sangakkara, however, said his side could have finished the game sooner.         
	When we batted, the openers maintained a good run rate and from there we carried on. In the Indian innings, Jayasuriyas four overs were magic.         
	Then Angelo Mathews bowled well. It was a team effort, said the Lanka captain who top-scored with a 37-ball 78.         
	We also fielded superbly in the first 16 overs. But we could have finished the game sooner and our bowlers would have to improve by bowling tight in the first six overs, he added.         
	Asked about his own form, Sangakkara said: I was in good form in the Test series also.

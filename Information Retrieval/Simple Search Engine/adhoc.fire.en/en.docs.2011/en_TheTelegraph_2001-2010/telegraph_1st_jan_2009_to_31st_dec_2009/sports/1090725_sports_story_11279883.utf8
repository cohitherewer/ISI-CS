The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lewis sets the pace at practice
                                                   Lewis sets the pace at practice
                      
	Budapest: World champion Lewis Hamilton led a McLaren one-two in Hungarian Grand Prix practice on Friday while Spanish teenager Jaime Alguersuari made a confident Formula One debut for Toro Rosso.         
	Hamilton was quickest overall with a lap of one minute 22.079 seconds, ahead of last years winner and teammate Heikki Kovalainen in 1:22.126, in the afternoon.         
	Kovalainen was fastest in the morning in 1:22.278.         
	With clear skies and temperatures of around 26 Celsius, McLarens new aerodynamic package immediately looked competitive.         
	The former champions have yet to get on the podium this season but that could change this weekend with Hamilton also third fastest in the morning.         
	What a podium result would do for this team, you cant imagine how good the feeling would be, Hamilton had said on his arrival on Thursday. Even though weve had podiums for our whole two years (at the team) this would feel very very special.         
	Championship leader Jenson Button, who had said on Thursday that there could be no excuses after two disappointing races in colder temperatures, was 10th and 13th in his Brawn.         
	Its supposed to be warm this weekend, so we should get the tyres to work, he had said. We also have some updates that will move us forward .         
	All eyes were on 19-year-old Alguersuari, set to become Formula Ones youngest ever starter on Sunday.         
	Starting cautiously, he steadily lowered his times before completing more than a race distance on his first day having covered 42 laps in the morning and another 40 after lunch. He was the slowest in both sessions, with times of 1:24.228 and 1:23.942 respectively, but not by much.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IFA seeking an extra foreigner
                                                   IFA seeking an extra foreigner
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Indian Football Association (IFA) will request the AIFF to allow city clubs to register three foreigners and one player of Asian origin.         
	The AIFF recently allowed I-League clubs to go for the 3+1 combination and now the IFA wants a similar provision for the Calcutta League, albeit with a little modification. In the local league only two foreigners and one Asian-origin player would be allowed in the playing eleven.         
	Calcutta League clubs should be allowed to register three foreigners and one from Asia. We dont want a change from the rule that binds the club to fielding 2+1 in the playing XI. Just allow the clubs to register one more foreigner, IFA secretary Utpal Ganguli said Saturday.         
	For the record, the I-League from this season onwards, will be played on the weekends and the local league will be played simultaneously during midweek.         
	Meanwhile, Ganguli will write to the AIFF saying the state body had no hand in the fielding of over-aged players for the national under-16 camp. Three players from Bengal  Md Alamgir, Mohammed Aqueel and Pronoy Karmakar  were in the list of 16 players who failed the MRI test in Goa.         
	Our medical report clearly said that they were over-aged and thats why we didnt induct Aqueel and Alamgir in the IFA Academy. Those two got selected after the AIFF spotters found them impressive, Ganguli said.

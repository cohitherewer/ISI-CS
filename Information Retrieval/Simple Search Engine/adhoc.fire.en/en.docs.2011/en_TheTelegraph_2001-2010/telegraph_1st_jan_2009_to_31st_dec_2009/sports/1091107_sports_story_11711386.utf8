The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal set for big win
                                                                                                                                     Bengal set for big win
            A STAFF REPORTER            Mohammed Ashrafuddin picked up 4 wickets                           
	Calcutta: Bengal were placed for an innings victory in their CK Nayudu Trophy match against Hyderabad at the Jadvpur University, Salt Lake campus ground.         
	Resuming at 299 for seven, the hosts added 81 runs Friday. Hyderabad, who were bundled out for 142 in their first innings, faltered in their second essay as well.         
	None of their batsmen succeeded in putting up a resistance as Bengal bowlers Mohammed Ashrafuddin (4/37) and Sayan Sekhar Mondal (3/43) reduced them to 158 for eight. To make matters worse for Hyderabad, who are still trailing by 80 runs, one of their batsmen Benjamin Thomas is injured and unlikely to bat.         
	So, theres only one Hyderabad wicket standing between an innings victory and six points for Bengal.         
	BRIEF SCORES: Hyderabad 142 amp; 158/8 (Mohammed Ashrafuddin 4/37, Sayan Shekhar Mandal 3/43). Bengal 380. Match to continue.

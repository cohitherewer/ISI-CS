The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Syria put Lanka in their place
                                                   Syria put Lanka in their place
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The open style of football that earned Sri Lanka accolades in their previous match proved to be their undoing as they lost 0-4 to Syria in an ONGC Nehru Cup match at the Ambedkar Stadium on Monday.         
	The Lankans, who came back from behind to beat Lebanon the other day, deployed the same strategy against Syria but paid dearly this time. Strong in the midfield and accurate in conversion, the Syrians raced to a 3-0 lead by half-time and scored once more in the second session for their second consecutive win of the tournament.         
	The Lanka defence also made the mistake of going for off-side traps against the speedy Syrians. It proved disastrous as Mohammed Alzino and Abdal Razak Al Hosain were left unmarked in an apparent attempt to catch them on the wrong foot as Syria struck their first two goals.         
	Syria in Nehru Cup 09 are perhaps a more compact side than the one that finished runners-up in the previous edition. They have the ability to control the pace of the game and play through the wings whenever they find the opponents crowding the defensive third.         
	While the first two goals came through headers, striker Abdul Fatah Alaga struck the other two with perfect grounders.

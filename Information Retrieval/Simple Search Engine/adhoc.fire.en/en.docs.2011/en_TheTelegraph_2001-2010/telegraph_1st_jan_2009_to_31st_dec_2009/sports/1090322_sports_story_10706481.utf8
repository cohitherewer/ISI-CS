                                                   Grant lifts the title with ease
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Adrian Grant, the No. 3 seed from England, didnt have to break a sweat to clinch the PSA Indian Challenger 2 squash championship as he defeated Egypts Hisham Mohammed Ashour in straight sets in the final at the Calcutta Racket Club on Saturday.         
	World No. 13 Grant finally broke his jinx as he won his first final in four attempts this year and got richer by $4293. He defeated No. 4 seed Ashour 11-8, 11-5, 11-8. The England player has now played Ashour thrice and won twice.         
	Ashour, who picked up a hip injury during Fridays semi-final, took the lead in the first and third set but failed to maintain the tempo. His movement on the court was visibly hampered by the injury.         
	Grant accepted that his job became easier due to Ashours injury. Hisham is immensely talented, but he was a bit injured. I was trying to stop him from getting consecutive points. I think my front game was good today, the winner said.Ashour, who received $2937 for finishing runner-up, also blamed his injury for his loss.

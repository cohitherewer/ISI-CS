            STAFF REPORTERS                      
	Calcutta: Subhas Chakrabortys demise Monday was mourned by the citys sports fraternity. Flags at the Maidan clubs flew at half-mast and athletes and administrators condoled the passing away of a leader long at the helm of sports affairs in the state.         
	While Chirag United called off their practice as a mark of respect, Mohun Bagan and East Bengal observed two minutes silence before their practice sessions, in Kalimpong and Puri respectively.         
	Chakrabortys death was also mourned by the following (alphabetically):         
	Sultan Ahmed: His death has created a vacuum in sports. He always went out of his way to help others.         
	Akhtar Ali: Ive lost a very good friend and the state has lost a good minister. Only 10 days back I had met him regarding two underprivileged and talented boys who play at the South Club. He was ready to help immediately.         
	Masudur Rahman Baidya: Without Subhasda, swimmer Masudur Rahman Baidya wouldnt have happened. When I had planned to cross the English Channel, 26 companies had refused me funds. He came forward and arranged the amount and that was how I was able to achieve my dream. He was the one who provided me with the artificial limbs without which life would have been so much more difficult for me.         
	PK Banerjee: A great loss for Bengal sports. He was the sports minister since 1987 and knew about problems faced by sports in the state. I have seen him go out of his way to help people. His love for football was genuine. Worked tirelessly for the uplift of the game. He was a very close friend. I will miss him.         
	Sambaran Banerjee: During my benefit match, in the 90s, he took an initiative and helped a lot. As a sports minister, he wanted to do so many things Subhasdas untimely death is a loss for the sports fraternity of Bengal.         
	Subrata Bhattacharya: A fantastic man and a very pragmatic politician. A North 24 Parganas club was having problems regarding a ground. I asked Subhasda if he could do something. A phone call and the matter was settled. I dont think anywhere in India you will find a sports minister so accessible to one and all.         
	Dipendu Biswas: Only recently, during Diego Maradonas visit, he called me and asked me to play the exhibition match. I want you to be there at the stadium, he told me. In 1999-00 Mohun Bagan were not letting me join East Bengal. He read about it in the newspapers and called me to his Salt Lake residence. In front of me he had a talk with Bagan president Swapan Sadhan (Tutu) Bose and requested him to release me. I havent seen anyone with such a big heart.         
	Bula Chowdhury: There are so many instances when he bailed me out in a difficult situation. Once when I had to go to the US (for one of her swimming endeavours) and couldnt manage air tickets, he was the one who came forward and helped me out. When I crossed Palk Strait, he was there to receive me. When I reached the destination, he came forward and congratulated me Ill never forget that day.         
	Pradip Chowdhury: A big-hearted man and a football lover. My employers (Steel Authority of India) run an academy and we faced problems regarding grounds. I went straight to Subhasda, knowing he wouldnt let me down.         
	Jagmohan Dalmiya: Personally, I was very close to him. It feels like losing a very close friend. Not only was he a superb administrator, he was a born leader.         
	Ashok Ghosh: I remember when we hosted the SAF Games, I went to him because we needed funds. He personally took me to Jyoti Basu and got some funds arranged.         
	Chuni Goswami: A colourful personality. Never one to mince his words, but a popular leader and a very helpful person. He had always been kind to me. I am grateful to him for that. Even though I am senior to him, I will always regard him as a friend, philosopher and guide.         
	Arun Lal: One could approach him with any kind of problem and he was always more than willing to do his best. Personally, there are so many occasions when he had helped that its almost impossible to single out a particular incident.         
	Jaidip Mukerjea: He helped out underprivileged children who showed promise in sport. He had helped me immensely during the Sunfeast Open as he had taken a personal interest in it.         
	Gurbux Singh: Its a very sad day for Bengal sports. He not only loved sports but loved sportsmen. This set him apart from the other politicians.He would always be kind enough to help the Bengal Hockey Association. Whenever I would go to his house, he would be kind enough to interact with me. He was easily approachable, unlike other politicians.         
	The Bengal Olympic Association, the Indian Football Association and the Calcutta Sports Journalists Club too expressed condolences.

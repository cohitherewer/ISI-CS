                                                   Ric: Didnt try to dissuade Brasa
                      
	New Delhi: Former technical advisor of Indian hockey, Ric Charlesworth Tuesday rubbished reports that he had tried to dissuade Spaniard Jose Brasa from taking up the Indian teams chief coachs job.         
	Charlesworth, who had a turbulent association with Indian hockey, admitted that Brasa did get in touch with him but he had never advised the Spaniard against travelling to India.         
	The rumour is incorrect. Such reports, as always, are typical of some Indian media houses. Jose (Brasa) did contact me and I outlined some ideas as to how he should go about it...especially with his children, living circumstances, advice about the team and staff and such matters, Charlesworth said in an email to a news agency. Of course, the fact that I have not yet been paid my dues is something he should know (it is public knowledge), he added.         
	Charlesworths reaction came after some media reports quoted Brasa as saying that the Australian apparently tried to dissuade him from going to India by narrating his own experience of dealing with the Union sports ministry and the IOA.         
	However, Charlesworth, who is presently in charge of the Australian mens hockey team, wished Brasa all the success on his new assignment and hoped that the Spaniard could scale great heights with the Indian team and revive the eight-time Olympic champions sagging fortunes.

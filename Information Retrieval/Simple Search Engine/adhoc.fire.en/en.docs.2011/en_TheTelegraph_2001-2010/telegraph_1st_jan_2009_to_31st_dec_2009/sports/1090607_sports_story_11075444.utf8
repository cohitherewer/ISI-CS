The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nothing wrong with the teams parade, says Sunil Gavaskar 
                                                   Nothing wrong with the teams parade, says Sunil Gavaskar 
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                        Sunil Gavaskar      
	Nottingham: Sunil Gavaskar, an icon and more, spoke to the media at the formal launch of Cricket Radio, a venture of the Dubai-based Channel 2 Group, on Saturday afternoon.         
	Later, Gavaskar had a one-on-one with The Telegraph.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On Fridays parade by Team India, intended to convey unity within         
	The best way of responding (to anything unpleasant in the media) is to focus on the job at hand... I think the relationship between the players and the media has been smooth, right from the 1930s... Because were such a big country, with different cultures and languages, its not always possible for all to think on the same lines... All five fingers cant be the same... However, once the team takes the field, all five fingers look the same... The unity is there.         
	The parade having been followed by a walkout, with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni not taking questions from the media         
	I suppose the team was trying to make a point... Nothing wrong with that... The team took the initiative to show everybody is together...         
	Whether he would have done the same had he been the captain         
	Its difficult to say... The circumstances (would come into play)... It wouldve been a tough call... Actually, theres a precedent of sorts that I set.         
	The precedent         
	We were having a camp in Bangalore, in the early Eighties if I recall correctly, when an English daily wrote about players doing hanky-panky and hinted at match-fixing or something... Almost all of us marched to that newspapers office and met the editor... We convinced him that the reporting had been incorrect. (Laughs) So, as Ive said, theres a precedent of sorts.         
	Whether the drama could distract the team         
	Dont think so... I expect the players to play out of their skins and thats going to be good for us.         
	Handling criticism         
	Its best to read things first-hand instead of hearing this or that from a well-wisher or a person trying to wind you up... My experience is that nine-and-a-half times out of 10, when somebody has told me something, Ive realised there actually wasnt much to it... Remember, from a distance, powder looks like smoke... I know, because a neighbour of mine complained to my mother that Id been smoking when, in fact, Id blown at powder placed inside a rolled sheet of paper. So, like that lady, dont mistake powder for smoke.         
	Players having reservations about reports in the media, yet themselves having no qualms over contributing columns         
	Its a personal thing... I guess when somebody offers a sum of money, the player in question will consider that...         
	Whether he would have enjoyed playing T20         
	(Laughs) Ive been asked this a number of times and my answer has always been yes, as T20 involves fielding for 20 overs only!         
	Indias T20 batsman he relates to the most         
	Rohit Sharma... He can bludgeon the bowling and, at the same time, play classically... I like watching (Virender) Sehwag, Dhoni and Yuvraj (Singh) too...         
	Automatic choices in his all-time India-specific T20 XI         
	Kapil Dev and Krishnamachari Srikkanth... Id probably open with Kapil. Id look for flexibility and all-rounders.         
	England being upset by The Netherlands in the World T20 opener         
	The Dutch kept their nerve, while the England players panicked in the last few overs... The shorter the game, better the chance for smaller teams to upset.         
	Difference between doing commentary on the TV and on radio         
	Radio is more challenging as youve got to say something after every ball... Its a lot harder, but Im up for it. On the TV, you can stay quiet if you cant add to the visual... Such moments arent there on radio.         
	Favourite commentator         
	Richie Benaud... He has always been dispassionate, which is remarkable... Its not easy being so when your national team is involved.         
	Anil Kumble and Sourav Ganguly joining the commentators brigade         
	Theyll be bringing freshness... Also their vast experience... One can expect Sourav to give an insight into the mind of a batsman... Kumble could do likewise, focusing on bowlers.         
	Finally, his message for Kumble and Sourav         
	To Sourav, Id say be frank as youve always been... As for Kumble, Id say speak your mind. I recall his stock as a captain and as a person soared after his only one team was playing in the spirit of the game comment at the SCG, early last year... That said so much.

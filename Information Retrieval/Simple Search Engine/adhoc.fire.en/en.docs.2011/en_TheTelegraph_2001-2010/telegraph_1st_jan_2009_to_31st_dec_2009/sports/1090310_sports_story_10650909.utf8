The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India face England hurdle
                                                   India face England hurdle
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The confident Indian eves, after spanking arch-rivals Pakistan in their opening encounter, will look to carry forward the momentum when they lock horns with England in a Group-B match in the ICC Womens World Cup in Sydney on Tuesday.         
	The Indian team, led by experienced Jhulan Goswami, started their campaign in style, defeating Pakistan by ten wickets, and the convincing win will surely add to their confidence about overcoming the Britons.         
	Indian women, who fell just one step short of lifting the Cup in the last edition, seem highly confident about achieving the feat this time and winning Tuesdays match will be an important hurdle crossed.         
	Winning a World Cup has always been a dream and if we are able to achieve it then it is going to be great but our next match is the most important. It was a good start for us and it always feels good to begin with a win, Anjum said.

                                                   McCullum: We missed Vettori
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Johannesburg: Stand-in New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum said they badly missed inspirational regular captain Daniel Vettori in the final.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Losing Daniel Vettori         
	Losing Daniel (Vettori) so late was a huge blow... We not only missed his bowling and batting, but inspirational presence... To lose him was obviously disappointing, but I still thought with the calibre of players we had, we could have pulled it off... Were disappointed with the result, but proud of what we achieved (making the final)... Its a step forward.         
	On when he came to know about Vettoris absence         
	It was in the bus, on reaching the ground, that I was told I would have to lead... From that point on, I guess I was ready to lead.         
	Dropping Cameron White on 15         
	It was obviously crucial. The score was roughly 40 at that time. If I had grabbed it, it would have been three for 70. Had we got another couple of quick wickets at that stage, we certainly would have been right on top at that stage. Any dropped catch is crucial. But that was certainly one as well...         
	The Australian side         
	In one-day cricket, they are certainly very strong. They have a well-knit squad led by Ricky, not just on the field with his performance but also off it. They obviously have got a nice blend of experience and youth. We saw two of them today, Cameron White and Shane Watson. Add Nathan Hauritz with the ball, theyve got some pretty good depth.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SL look to maintain record
                                                   SL look to maintain record
                      
	Colombo: Sri Lankas outgoing captain Mahela Jayawardene led his team to Pakistan Saturday, hoping for victory on his final assignment before stepping down.         
	It is a big challenge to play in Pakistan. We aim to win and maintain our record of at least one win in each of the last few away series, the Sri Lankan captain said, as his team left for the two-Test tour in Pakistan, where they are replacing India.         
	India pulled out of the tour after the Mumbai terror attacks, which New Delhi blamed on Pakistan-based militants.         
	Winning will be of special significance to me, said Jayawardene, referring to his decision to step down from the Sri Lankan captaincy.         
	He said he was looking forward to a good performance from Suranga Lakmal, a rookie medium fast bowler. Lakmal, a gangling right-armer from the rural south, plays for the same club as Muttiah Muralidharan.

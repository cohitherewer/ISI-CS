The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Worst loss of my life: Shukla
                                                                                                                       7                                      Worst loss of my life: Shukla
    - Rohan, Deep are in the line of fire after debacle vs UP             A STAFF REPORTER                                                  Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Roger Binny      
	Calcutta: Disappointed would be an understatement. Laxmi Ratan Shukla was devastated after Thursdays loss in the crucial group league encounter against Uttar Pradesh.         
	Chasing a target of 236, Uttar Pradesh beat Bengal by three wickets inside three days in their Ranji Super League Group B match Thursday.         
	This is the worst defeat of my life. I simply cant believe that we bowled them out for 62 and then lost the match. The way our batting collapsed twice in the match is unacceptable. After losing this match, I feel we have perfected the art of losing close matches from a winning position, Shukla said from Kanpur.         
	What exactly has been the problem with this Bengal team? Weve had our share of good individual performances but have failed to click as a unit. To perform as a team, the players need to increase their consistency levels, he answered.         
	If one leaves out veteran Sourav Gangulys contribution of 66 from the first innings total of 193, the rest of the team has contributed 127 runs.         
	Shukla, however, denied that Bengal team is still overtly dependent on the former India captain.         
	Souravs performance should have been a lesson for all of us. Someone who hasnt played in the longer version for close to a year comes back and performs like a champion. But is it fair to expect Dada to perform each and every time for us. Its high time all of us came out of our comfort zones to introspect.         
	The most frustrating part in the whole thing is that if Delhi win with a bonus point then our last match becomes an inconsequential one, the skipper said.         
	Teamamte Ranadeb Bose, who had a match haul of eight wickets, was more forthright.         
	Uttar Pradesh were deserving winners. If a team bowl out their opponents for 193 and 104, they deserve to win the match.         
	The defeat has shocked those associated with Bengal cricket; some of the senior officials want strict measures taken.         
	If one goes by the general mood among the Cricket Association of Bengal brass, Rohan Gavaskar and Deep Dasgupta are in the line of fire. However, with one match left, a section feels that the duo should be allowed to complete the season.         
	Coach Roger Binnys role has also come in for criticism.         
	The selectors will have to take a tough call. We need to inject fresh blood. Performance should be the ultimate criterion for being selected in the state team. We are providing them with each and every facility but are getting nothing in return, joint secretary Biswarup Dey said.

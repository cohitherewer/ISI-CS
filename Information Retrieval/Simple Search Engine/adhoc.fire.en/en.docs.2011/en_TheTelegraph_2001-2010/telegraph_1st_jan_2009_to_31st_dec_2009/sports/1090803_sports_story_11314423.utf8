    - Board agrees with players that the system of testing is unreasonable           OUR CORRESPONDENT            Mahendra Singh Dhoni leaves the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai on Sunday. (AP)                                 
	Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Sunday threw its weight behind its players and rejected the controversial whereabouts clause of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) code.         
	The BCCI, which held an emergent meeting of its working committee at its Cricket Centre here, said it endorsed the players concerns over the clause which requires athletes to provide information about their whereabouts throughout the year and 90 days in advance.         
	The Board has decided to inform the International Cricket Council (ICC) about the concerns expressed by our players. The Board agrees with the players that the system (of testing) is unreasonable, BCCI president Shashank Manohar said.         
	We agree that doping control is necessary in cricket but we have objections to the system of testing. The players are available for testing when they are playing or training and during camps. But to ask them to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 365 days a year is not acceptable.         
	As regards Out of Competition testing, the Board will suggest to the ICC that the players are not against it but the ICC would have to tell the Board in advance which player they want to test and the Board will produce the player within 24 hours.         
	On the question of whereabouts, there are three aspects. First, some of the Indian players have security cover and are not supposed to disclose their whereabouts.         
	Second, they feel their privacy is being invaded and, third, the Indian Constitution gives a guarantee to every citizen regarding privacy which nobody can invade, Manohar said.         
	Nine men and two women cricketers from India have been named by the ICC in its registered testing pool as mandated by the Wada code. They are: captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Harbhajan Singh, Yuvraj Singh, Zaheer Khan, Gautam Gambhir, Irfan Pathan, Munaf Patel, Jhulan Goswami and Mithali Raj.         
	Dhoni, Yuvraj and Harbhajan, who were also present at the meeting, met ICC lawyer, Ian Higgins, to convey their views prior to the working committee meeting.         
	The BCCI stance assumes significance on several fronts. The immediate repercussions are for the players themselves since the first deadline for them to sign the Wada code passed on August 1. Three such defaults would be deemed a failed test under the code, and three failed tests over an 18-month period would constitute a doping violation.         
	Also, the BCCI decision throws the ICC, a signatory to the Wada code, in a quandary particularly because players from other countries have already signed on the dotted line.         
	We have just now taken a decision. We dont know what the ICC is going to do, Manohar said when asked about the penalty faced by the Indian cricketers.         
	Football and cycling have already rejected the new code and have said they are exploring alternatives.         
	Manohar hinted that that might be an option for the ICC to consider. Its up to the ICC (to decide), he said.

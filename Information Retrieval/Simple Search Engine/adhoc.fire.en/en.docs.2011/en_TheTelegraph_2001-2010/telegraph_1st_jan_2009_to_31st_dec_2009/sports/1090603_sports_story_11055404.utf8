                                                   Goal 2011 has to succeed, says Patel
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The All-India Football Federation (AIFF) is set to go full throttle on the ambitious Goal 2011 Project very soon, according to Praful Patel, the president-in-charge of the national body.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph on Tuesday, the AIFF boss also asserted that the Calcutta clubs will have to release their footballers for the long-term national preparatory camp for the 2011 Asia Cup.         
	The project has to succeed. If need be, I will talk to the Calcutta clubs and persuade them to release the players, Patel said. He made it clear that the Goal 2011 plan cannot be abandoned for want of money.         
	Patel, who took charge of the AIFF after Priya Ranjan Das Munshi took critically ill, said he had already spoken to a few big corporate houses to finance the project.         
	I dont want to make public the names of the companies at the moment, Patel said. Soon I will talk to few others and request them to back the project for the national cause. Money shouldnt be a problem.         
	We have been languishing somewhere between 140 and 150 for a long time. It cannot go on for ever. The current project for the 2011 Asia Cup could be our first step towards a beginning, Patel said.         
	As per the Goal 2011 plans, the footballers will be kept in the national camp on a long-term basis and play regular international matches to prepare for the Asia Cup in Doha . The cost of the project could be between Rs 30 and Rs 40 crores.         
	The AIFF chief said there was no reason to believe that the Rs 100-crore Bharti-Academy project had been shelved.         
	The project is very much on, Patel said. After we failed to get the land in Goa, the plan was to start it in Haryana. I have been told the state government could not provide land. I may now try to do it in Goa again. The academy has to come up.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brett Lee unsure for second one-dayer
                                                     Brett Lee unsure for second one-dayer
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Brett Lee                           
	Calcutta: Australias victory in the series opener has clearly come at a price. Brett Lee, Mitchell Johnson and James Hopes were all found to have either picked up, or aggravated, injuries during Sundays ODI at Vadodara and an update on the teams injury status has ruled out the latter for Wednesdays second tie at Nagpur while terming the two bowlers doubtful.         
	Following scans on the trio in Vadodara on Monday morning it was found that Hopes had suffered a hamstring strain, Lee an elbow strain and Johnson an inversion strain on his left ankle.         
	Kevin Sims, the Australian team physiotherapist commenting on the injuries said: Hopes has a minor right hamstring strain. He will therefore be unavailable for the next game. However, the all-rounder is expected to be available for the latter games of this series, Cricket Australia said in a release Monday.         
	As to Lee and Johnson the physio said that: Lee has a mild right elbow strain and will continue to be treated and assessed prior to the next game, while Johnsons availability will depend on how he responds to treatment over the next two days before a decision is made for the second game of the series.         
	The injuries are to key members of the squad with the one to Lee likely to be the biggest concern given the bowlers role in the Australian attack.         
	And in all this it cannot be forgotten that Lee, along with Nathan Hauritz and Doug Bollinger, joined the team in Vadodara on the night before the match  after guiding the New South Wales Blues to the Champions League T20 title in Hyderabad on Friday.         
	Winning the series opener could not dilute Ricky Pontings anger and the Australia captain is absolutely furious, saying that the Champions League T20 has hindered his teams preparation for the ongoing series.         
	The NSW trio missed four training sessions and the pre-match team meeting as well.         
	While all three arrived fatigued, Lee had the additional complaint of a sore elbow, which prevented him from bowling towards the end of Sundays ODI.         
	Theres no doubt those guys playing in the (Champions League T20) final hindered our preparation, Ponting said.         
	We had three players fly in and get to the hotel at 8.30pm Saturday night and we were leaving the hotel at 7am on matchday.         
	There was not much time for us to get our team tactics in order. We had a team meeting after training and those blokes were not even here, Ponting was quoted as saying by an Australian news agency. It hindered our preparation and theirs, he added.         
	However, Ponting said that having all the players around now is a big relief for him.         
	Now we have our whole group together, we will be able to talk tactics through and see how we go from there, he said.         
	Ponting, too, sounded unsure of Lees availability: He got a little bit sore in his elbow towards the end of his second bowling spell. He came off and had it looked at and then came back on and fielded for the rest of the game but right at the moment we are not sure.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Johnson mother speaks up
                                                   Johnson mother speaks up
                      
	Melbourne: Mitchell Johnsons mother says she is not to blame for her sons poor bowling form at the Ashes.         
	Johnsons mother, Vikki Harber, had told Australian media on the eve of the series that her son had hardly contacted her since marrying Jessica Bratich. Harber has not spoken to her son since January and said she was really upset to see him struggling over there.         
	Because despite some of the stuff thats been reported, Im not angry. Im not upset, either. But there isnt a mother in Australia who ever stops worrying about her boy, no matter how old he gets - and I dont see why I should be any different.

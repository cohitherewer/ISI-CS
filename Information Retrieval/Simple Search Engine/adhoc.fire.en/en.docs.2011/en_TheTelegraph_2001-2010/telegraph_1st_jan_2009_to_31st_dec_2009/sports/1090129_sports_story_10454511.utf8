                                                   Ranadeb, Manoj keen to shine
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Manoj Tiwary is keen to make amends for the disappointment of Ranji Trophy quarter finals with an eye-catching performance in the Duleep Trophy.         
	The Bengal batsman, part of the East Zone squad, that will take on the West in one of the two semifinals starting here on Thursday, has had a decent outing this season, averaging 49.40 with 494 runs.         
	But Tiwarys brilliant 144 (his third hundred of the season) against Tamil Nadu in the Ranji Trophy Super League quarter final went in vain as the team lost.         
	 I was disappointed Had we made it to the semi-finals, it would have given me one more opportunity and I was in good flow. These little things can make a difference, Tiwary told The Telegraph on Thursday.         
	This is a great opportunity for me. The selectors will keep their eyes on and doing well here will help, especially with so many matches coming up. Besides, East have not won the Duleep Trophy. It would be nice to be part of a winning team.         
	Tiwarys teammate Ranadeb Bose, too, will be keenly looking forward to the match because Mumbai, and especially the CCI, has been a happy hunting ground for him. It was at this venue three seasons ago that Bose picked up a fiver against a Zimbabwe Presidents XI.         
	I have many happy memories of Mumbai. The pitches here have more bounce. There is also the sea breeze that plays a part. So it is not just on the first but every morning there is some movement for the pace bowlers, Bose, who averages 14.66 with 33 wickets this season, said.

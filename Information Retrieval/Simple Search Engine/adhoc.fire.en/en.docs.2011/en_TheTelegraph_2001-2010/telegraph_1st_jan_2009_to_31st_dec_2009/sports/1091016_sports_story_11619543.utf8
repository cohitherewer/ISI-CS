The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Capello equates Beckham award to Obamas Nobel Prize
                                                     Capello equates Beckham award to Obamas Nobel Prize
            Jason Burt            David Beckham                           
	Fabio Capello equated David Beckham being given the man-of-the-match award in Englands victory over Belarus on Wednesday night to Barack Obama recently being announced as the next recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.         
	After eight months as President he won the Nobel Prize, Capello said, and after 30 minutes David won the man-of-the-match. The England managers surprise at the decision, after such a brief involvement, was matched by that of the 76,000-strong crowd and David Beckham himself. I dont know how I got it, he said although the award was made by his former Manchester United team-mate, Steve Bruce.         
	Beckham was a second-half substitute, arriving to a raucous reception, and struck the post but the award was curious given that Peter Crouch scored two goals, taking his tally for his country to an impressive 18 in 35 appearances.         
	Beckham confirmed that his move to AC Milan, for whom he can play from January, was now 95 per cent complete. He added: That move to Milan is close. Ive always said I wanted to go back there if they wanted me. Milan are still saying they do. Its very close, so I cant see it not happening now.         
	Capello said it was important that Beckham made the move and played in Europe before the World Cup Finals. For me its very important, because Beckham, when he played the last 20 minutes, 50 minutes, half an hour, from half-time, hes always played well and been focused, he said.         
	Sometimes some players when theyre substitutes have problems playing normally. Beckham always plays well.         
	Crouch admitted that despite his goals he did not expect to start Englands next match, away to Brazil in a friendly next month, but he also paid tribute to Beckham, who won his 115th cap after being left out of the 18-man squad against Ukraine because Capello had deemed him tired. David made a difference, Crouch said.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

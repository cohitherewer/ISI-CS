The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Syces hold key to Derby
                                                                                                               Syces hold key to Derby 
            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: The Derby Day races, on February 28, have come under a cloud of uncertainty. A section of RCTCs syces believes that Lt Gen. (retd) J. R. Mukherjees resignation from the post of RCTCs CEO may do more harm to their cause than any good. The General has resigned because of a club members ugly remark. He had given the RCTC Karmachari Union (RKU), the officially recognised syces union, a written assurance that two of their important demands, pertaining to employees provident fund (EPF) and the reconstruction of syces basic pay, will be attended to before February 28.           
	Generals resignation has cast shadow on the issue in view of time running out fast. Nothing conclusively was achieved at the Wednesdays meeting with the RCTCs chairman, Cyrus Madan; said a syce. No General, no Derby was the slogan renting the air after the meeting; he added. Incidentally, K. K. Srivastava, working president, RKU, strongly feels that General Mukerjee has been made a sacrificial goat. Generals exit has been stage-managed because RCTC wants to drag on the issue; he said when contacted in Pune over his phone. Jagmohan Masandrai, general secretary RKU did not counter Srivastavas observations but added: I am against strikes. All disputes can be settled amicably if the concerned parties are willing. He also hinted that syces are the ones who may decide about the fate of the Derby.

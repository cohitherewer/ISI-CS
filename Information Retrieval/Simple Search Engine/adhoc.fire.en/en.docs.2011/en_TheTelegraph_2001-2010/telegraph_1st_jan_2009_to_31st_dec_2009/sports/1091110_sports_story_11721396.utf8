                                                                                                                                   Want to play my natural game: Yusuf
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Yusuf Pathan is taking every match in the Ranji Trophy as a stepping stone to his comeback into the national side.         
	The Baroda all-rounder was dropped from Indias one-day side after the teams disastrous campaign in the Champions Trophy in South Africa.         
	I am concentrating on playing my natural game. Not much adjustment My duty is to perform and it is up to the selectors to decide Yusuf said, after nets on Monday.         
	Baroda take on Bengal at the Eden from Tuesday, and this will be the first time Yusuf will be playing a first-class match here. He had earlier turned out for Rajasthan Royals at the Eden, in the inaugural edition of the Indian Premier League.         
	This will also be the first time Ill be playing a first-class match against Sourav (Ganguly). I hope to learn something from him, Yusuf remarked.         
	Yusuf is aware that Barodas fortunes will depend, to a large extent, on how him and his brother Irfan.         
	Both of us are out of the Indian side. If Baroda do well, it will also mean something for us It will mean a chance for us to get noticed. Also, our playing well will mean something good will happen for Baroda in the Ranji Trophy, said Yusuf.         
	Yusuf, who arrived in the city late on Sunday, also said that Irfan was right when he had pointed out that he was a better bowler. quot;Theres no additional pressure on both of us, quot; said Yusuf.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tough draw for Federer, Hewitt
                                                     Tough draw for Federer, Hewitt
                  Sania to meet Domachowska in first round                     
	Melbourne: Roger Federer will begin his bid to equal Pete Samprass record of 14 Grand Slam titles against Italian Andreas Seppi in the first round of the Australian Open next week.         
	Top seed Rafael Nadal, who snapped Federers record 237-week stint as world No.1 last August, will meet Belgiums Christophe Rochus after the draw was made at Melbourne Park on Friday.         
	Defending champion Novak Djokovic was drawn to meet a qualifier in his opening match but if the seeds live up to their billing, he could be on another collision course with Federer in the semi-finals.         
	Fourth seed Andy Murray, tipped to end Britains 73-year wait for a mens Grand Slam champion, was slotted into the same half of the draw as Nadal and will start his campaign against Romanias Andrei Pavel.         
	Federer will need to be on guard if he is to win a fourth trophy in Melbourne since his path is littered with banana skins, including a potential second-round match with former world No.1 Carlos Moya. If he survives that test, Marat Safin could be his next opponent. The Russian beat the Swiss en route to the 2005 title.         
	Seventh seed Andy Roddick and Argentinas David Nalbandian, the 10th seed, could face off in an intriguing fourth-round battle.         
	Lleyton Hewitts chances of adding to his two Grand Slam crowns looked slim after he was drawn to face 2007 runner-up Fernando Gonzalez of Chile in the first round. The match was greeted with an audible sigh by the assembled local media and tournament volunteers, though tournament director Craig Tiley said fan interest would still be high should Hewitt be knocked out early.         
	Its a tough draw, but Lleyton is playing good tennis and he can cope with the conditions, Tiley told reporters. The quality of matches in the first round and throughout the tournament are still really high.         
	Tiley said ticket sales were tracking to the same level as last year.         
	Sania Mirza will kick off her campaign with a first-round match against Marta Domachowska of Poland and might run into 10th seed Nadia Petrova if she clears the hurdle in the first Grand Slam of the year. World No.61 Domachowska had beaten the Indian in their only previous meeting in a hardcourt tournament back in 2003.         
	Womens world No.1 Jelena Jankovic, entering a Grand Slam for the first time as the top seed, will open her campaign against Austrias Yvonne Meusburger. Serena Williams, who defeated Jankovic in the 2008 US Open final and is the second seed at Melbourne Park, will play Yuan Meng of China.         
	The American, targeting a fourth title in the seasons opening major, faces a tricky passage through the draw as she could run into 2006 champion Amelie Mauresmo in the fourth round before setting up a possible semi-final with sister Venus.         
	Russians Dinara Safina, seeded third, and fourth seed Elena Dementieva, the Beijing Olympic champion, will play Alla Kudryavtseva and Kristina Barrios respectively. Safina was drawn in the top half with Jankovic.         
	Last years runner-up Ana Ivanovic was picked to face Julia Goerges of Germany.                 (AGENCIES)

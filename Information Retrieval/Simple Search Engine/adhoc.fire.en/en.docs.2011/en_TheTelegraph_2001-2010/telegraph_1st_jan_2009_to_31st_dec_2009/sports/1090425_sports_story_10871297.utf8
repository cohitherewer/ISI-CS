                                                     Explosive line-ups promise run-fest
                  Adam Gilchrist                     
	Durban: The Deccan Chargers and the Mumbai Indians take on each other in the Indian Premier League (IPL) here on Saturday in what promises to be a run-feast, given the explosive batting line-ups of both the teams.         
	Both sides are through with two matches each and while the Deccan Chargers have won both, the Mumbai team have won one and had to split points in their second match against the Rajasthan Royals due to a washout.         
	It has been a dramatic turnaround for the Adam Gilchrist-led Deccan Chargers, who finished at the bottom of the table last season.         
	Gilchrist led from the front against the Royal Challengers Bangalore, hitting a blistering 71 to take the Deccan Chargers to a dominating win.         
	Rohit also played a crucial 52-run knock, prompting Gilchrist to describe him as a class act.         
	The triumph propelled the side to the top of the table with four points and though the Delhi DareDevils caught up with them after beating the Chennai Super Kings on Friday, the Hyderabad team remained on top owing to a better run-rate.         
	The Mumbai Indians, on the other hand, have not played since their stunning opening win over last years runners-up the Chennai Super Kings.         
	Skipper Sachin Tendulkar looked in good touch as he played a 59-run knock while the young Abhishek Nayar also showed promise with a quick-fire 34 as the Mumbai team beat the Super Kings. Ageing warrior Sanath Jayasuriyas form will also be crucial for the Mumbai team.

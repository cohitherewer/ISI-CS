                                                     EB need   a point 
            A STAFF REPORTER            East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick with his players during a practice session at the club ground on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: East Bengal face JCT in a tricky I-League match at the Barasat Stadium on Friday. The red and gold brigade, with 24 points from 20 matches, need at least a point from their last two matches to avoid relegation while JCT (22 points from 20 matches) need four points from their remaining ties to stay afloat.         
	East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick, though, refuses to believe that his team are facing relegation. He thinks the media should ask these questions to teams lower down on the league table. There are other teams who are hovering around the relegation zone, not East Bengal. We are safe and sound, Bhowmick said, a trifle agitated at the news conference on Thursday.         
	Bhowmicks angst is probably a reaction to Mohun Bagans snide remarks about life without East Bengal in the I-League First Division.         
	On Friday, East Bengal will be without Sunil Chetri, Surkumar Singh and M. Suresh, all of whom are out with injuries. Bhowmick said their absence wouldnt affect the outcome of the match. But Sukhwinder argued that if you dont miss quality players then what difference do they make?         
	I think Chetris absence will be felt, the JCT coach said after a practice session at the Mohun Bagan ground. Nobody knows better than Sukhwinder how much Chetri matters when is playing. The India international got a new lease of life under Sukhwinder during his three-year stay in JCT and, ever since he moved to Calcutta, life hasnt been the same for the Phagwara outfit. Its because Edu (JCTs Brazilian striker Eduardo da Silva) could not live up to the expectations this season, Sukhwinder rued.         
	Now, Eduardo is partnering one Paul MacJames upfront.         
	JCT are hoping that Paul gets his name on the scoresheet once again on Friday. The East Bengal back-four  Nirmal Chetri, Mehrajuddin Wadoo, Suleh Musah and Soumik Dey  will have to work overtime to negate the threat from Edu, Paul and the two widemen, Baljit Singh Sahni and Amandeep Singh.         
	East Bengal will play Syed Rahim Nabi and Yusif Yakubu upfront with Mehtab Hossain, Ismael Addo, Jayanta Sen and Rennedy Singh bringing up the midfield.         
	The kick-off is at 6.30 p.m.

                                                   Yuki Bhambri   added as fifth member
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: India have retained their four-member squad, with Somdev Dev Varman leading the singles challenge, for the third and final round Davis Cup tie against Australia, starting May 8. The winner of the Asia/Oceania Group I tie will advance to the World Group II play-offs.         
	The All India Tennis Association (AITA) selection committee, led by chairman Anil Dhupar, decided to retain the same side, which won the second round tie against Chinese Taipei. The other members of the squad are Leander Paes, Mahesh Bhupathi, and Rohan Bopanna.         
	The committee also decided to have Yuki Bhambri, who recently won the Australian Open Junior title, as the fifth member of the squad. The non playing captain of the team will be S.P. Misra, a press release said.         
	India have announced their squad, a day before it expected the International Tennis Federation to confirm a venue for the match. The AITA selected Chennai as the venue for the May 8-10 match. But Australian authorities cited security concerns and sought a change of venue.

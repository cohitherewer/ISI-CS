            SHARMISTHA CHAUDHURI                                      Saina Nehwal exults after her win on Thursday. (AP)      
	Hyderabad: There were a couple of firsts for India in the World Badminton Championships at the Gachibowli Stadium on Thursday. Saina Nehwal survived some anxious moments before earning her maiden quarter final berth in the World meet, while the mixed doubles team of Jwala Gutta and V Diju entered the last eight for the first time with a straight-set win.         
	While Saina defeated Petya Nedelcheva of Bulgaria 18-21, 21-18, 21-10, the Jwala-Diju combination prevailed over the Polish combination of Robert Mateusiak and Nadiezda Kostiuczyk 21-11, 22-20.         
	Now, to keep the Indian interest going, Saina and the mixed doubles duo will have to continue winning. Will they be able to or they will bite the dust? Well, for that we will have wait till Friday.Saina will be playing second seed Lin Wang in the last eight.         
	Jwalas husband and national champion Chetan Anand though will not be there as his campaign ended on Thursday . The national champions dream of making to the quarters ended when he lost 16-21, 16-21 to sixth seed Sony Dwi Kuncoro of Indonesia.         
	Coming to the 19-year-old Saina, the local favourite was rusty and nervous in the first game.         
	Leading 18-15, Saina threw away the game by making some unforced errors and the Bulgarian made the most of the benevolence taking an 1-0 lead by winning six points in a row.         
	They say, when the going gets tough the tough gets going. In the second game, it was a different Saina altogether. She planned her game well, smashing only when she needed to finish off points. She kept the shuttle in play and that made Petya nervous as she started making unforced to errors.         
	At 18-10, in Sainas favour, when the crowd was bracing up for the third game, Petya almost played party pooper and levelled the score at 18-18. Saina, however, was undaunted and then smashed her way to win 21-18.         
	In the final game, as the crowd got behind Saina, the Indonesian Open winner just did not give a chance to her rival. Petyas final backhand went out, the Saina camp heaved a sigh of relief.         
	Jwala Gutta and V. Diju, the eighth-seeded mixed doubles duo, began confidently. Their smashes and understanding left their Polish opponents clueless on the court.         
	The duo, however, could have finished off the match earlier but they wasted three match points before converting the fourth one to their advantage.         
	They next play the Indonesian second seeds and the reigning World mixed doubles champions, Nova Widianto and Liliyana Natsir.         
	Earlier, Peter Gade set up a mouth-watering quarter final clash with Lin Dan. While Gade got the better of 10th seed, Yan Kit Chen of Hong Kong 21-11, 21-13, the Super Dan toyed with his opponent, Danish Dicky Palyama before emerging victorious 21-11, 21-11.         
	Gade is one of the very few to have beaten Dan in his own den. The former All-England champion defeated the 25-year-old Chinese two years back at the Chinese Masters.         
	Fourth seed Taufik Hidayat of Indonesia, Malaysian top seed Lee Chong Wei and second seed Jin Chen of China also sailed through.         
	On the womens side, fifth seed Xingfang Xie, top seed Mi Zhou, seventh-seeded Chinese Lan Lu and second seed Lin Wang advanced. There was a upset though. Eleventh seed German Juliane Schenk showed the door to fourth seed Yihan Wang of China 21-18, 21-15.

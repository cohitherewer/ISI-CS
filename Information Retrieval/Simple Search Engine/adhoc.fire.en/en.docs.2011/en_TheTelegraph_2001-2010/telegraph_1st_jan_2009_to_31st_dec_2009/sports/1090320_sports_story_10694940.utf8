The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Humpy back in joint lead
                                                   Humpy back in joint lead
                      
	Istanbul: Top seed Grandmaster Koneru Humpy scored a thumping victory over former world champion Antoaneta Stefanova of Bulgaria and was helped by other results to come back in joint lead at the end of the 10th round of IS Bank Atatyurk Women Grand Prix chess event here on Thursday.         
	Humpy demonstrated a brilliant attack and outplayed Stefanova but importantly for her French girl Marie Sebag came good against overnight leader Zhao Xue of China while second seed Yifan Hao of China was also held to a draw by Elina Danielian of Armenia.         
	Humpy thus joined Zhao and Yifan in lead on 7.5 points out of a possible 10 and now the last round will determine the fate of the three leaders.         
	Elina Danielian held the fourth spot on seven points and was the only one within striking distance of the leaders. The last round pairings give an edge to Yifan as she is playing an off-form Shen Yang of China.

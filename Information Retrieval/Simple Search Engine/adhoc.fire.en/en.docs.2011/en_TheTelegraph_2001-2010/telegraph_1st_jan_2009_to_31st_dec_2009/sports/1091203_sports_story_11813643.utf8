	Calcutta: Struggling to find a new sponsor for the Indian cricket team, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Wednesday decided to extend its existing contract with Sahara by another six months.         
	The BCCI marketing committee comprising of president Shashank Manohar and secretary N Srinivasan stated that the board has decided to extend the team sponsorship contract of Sahara by six months on the existing terms and conditions.         
	Before the expiry of the extension period, a fresh tender would be issued, inviting bids for the same, Srinivasan said.         
	He also announced that the title and ground rights for Indias two Twenty20 International matches against Sri Lanka later this month have been awarded to the World Sports Group at Rs. 3.15 crores per match.         
	With the existing contract coming to an end on December 31 and no other companies coming forward, the BCCI had to extend the contract by another six months by which it plans to rope in a new sponsor for Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men.         
	Sahara had signed a four-year-deal in 2006 for Rs 313.80 crores.           (PTI)

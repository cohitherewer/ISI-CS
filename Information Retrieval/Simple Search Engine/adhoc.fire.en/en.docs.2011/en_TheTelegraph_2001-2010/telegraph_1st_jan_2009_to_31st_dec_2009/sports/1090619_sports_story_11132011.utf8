                                                   Fidel unlikely vs Lanka
            OUR BUREAU                      
	The West Indies are likely to miss Fidel Edwards in their semi-final against Sri Lanka in the ICC World Twenty20 at the Oval on Friday.         
	The fast bowler is yet to recover from the injury that kept him out of their final Super Eight match against England. He is suffering from pain at the root of a nerve in the lower back region.         
	The West Indies captain Chris Gayle admitted his team were the underdogs and that the tag would help them enjoy the semi-final.         
	He has been very good for us throughout the tournament, said Gayle.         
	Hes the sort of bowler who can actually win you games, he can get crucial wickets at crucial times.         
	Gayle was happy with the conditions. Its a good wicket and a fast outfield and the environment has been really brilliant with the supporters, Gayle said.         
	Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara expects a tough fight and didnt put any pressure on his players by saying that it was them that are the favourites.

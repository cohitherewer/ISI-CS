	Colombo: India fended off a spirited challenge by Sri Lanka to snatch a thrilling 15-run victory in the second one-dayer and take a 2-0 lead in the five-match series here Saturday.         
	After posting a competitive 256 for nine, courtesy Yuvraj Singhs half-century, the visitors warded off Sri Lankas late fightback to stop them at 241 in a pulsating floodlit encounter.         
	Ishant Sharma, who took three wickets in the first match, returned figures of four for 56 in his nine overs as Zaheer Khan, Praveen Kumar and Pragyan Ojha chipped in with a wicket apiece.         
	Thilina Kandambys brilliant unbeaten 93 went in vain as Indians held on to their nerves in the tense final moments to romp home in the day-nighter. With Saturdays win, India have notched up their seventh consecutive ODI victory.         
	Electing to bat, India scored 256 for nine with Yuvraj Singh and Virender Sehwag being the main contributors on a slow track at the Premadasa Stadium. The two teams will play their next match, another day-nighter, at the same venue on February 3.         
	The visitors were on the drivers seat early on, reducing the Lankans to 36 for three within eight overs. But two fighting half-centuries by captain Mahela Jayawardene and rookie Kandamby took Lanka to striking distance of a marvellous win.         
	The Lankan duo stitched an invaluable 100-run stand for the fourth wicket to frustrate the Indians before losing the plot towards the end.         
	Kandamby, who was dropped by Tendulkar when he was on eight, was the thorn in Indias flesh. He started the innings cautiously but gained confidence later on to raise hopes of a Lankan victory.         
	After the 30th over, the required run rate crossed seven but Jayawardene and Kandamby slowly but steadily inched ahead before the home team captain was out for 52 while trying to hit Ojha inside out, holing out to Yusuf Pathan at extra cover.         
	That dismissal snapped a 100-run stand between Jayawardene and Kandamby, made off 162 balls. Jayawardene scored his first half-century after 13 innings from 75 balls with the help of one four and a six.         
	India looked like cruising to victory with the Lankans needing nine an over from the last 10 overs but some lusty hits by Kandamby took the required rate down to eight from the last five overs with four wickets in hand.         
	But three run outs in the space of 16 balls and 13 runs saw India win the match.         
	Earlier, Yuvraj top-scored with an 88-ball 66 and stitched a 85-run fourth-wicket partnership with Suresh Raina to stabilise the Indian innings after the first three wickets fell within 13 overs.

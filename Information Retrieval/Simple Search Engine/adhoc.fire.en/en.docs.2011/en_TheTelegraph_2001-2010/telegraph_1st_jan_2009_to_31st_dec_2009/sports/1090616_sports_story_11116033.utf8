The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Six-wicket haul for Chawla
                                                   CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	 Six-wicket haul for Chawla
    Worcester: Indian leg-spinner Piyush Chawla shone with the ball with a six-wicket haul after his fine batting effort to ensure a 10-wicket victory for Sussex over Worcestershire in the County Championship Division One first-class match.         
	In his debut match for the side, Chawla followed up his maiden century with a six for 152 in the Worcestershire second innings on the final day to bundle out the home side for 392 on an unresponsive pitch to give Sussex their first win of the season.         
	Sussex had posted a mammoth 620 for nine in their first innings and had shot out Worcestershire for 288 to take a 332-run lead. Chawla, who signed this week as a temporary replacement for Pakistans Yasir Arafat, will play only one more championship match, against Somerset at Hove, before his short-term contract as overseas player expires.               
	 Krish hopeful
    London: Former India captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth believes that Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men would put behind the debacle and bounce back despite failure to defend their World Twenty20 title. Winning and losing are parts of cricket. I myself have been part of a team that won the World Cup and immediately lost badly and then came back to winning ways. Similarly, Im sure this team, too, will bounce back. Im confident of that, we just need to re-work and correct ourselves, Srikkanth said.               
	 Bond welcome
    Nottingham: New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori said Monday he would welcome fast bowler Shane Bond back into the team as soon his availability was confirmed. Bond, who turned 34 last week, signed for the unofficial Indian Cricket League (ICL) last year and was banned from international cricket.               
	 Ban lifted
    Dhaka: Bangladesh has lifted a ban on 14 players after they cancelled contracts with the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL). Former captain Habibul Bashar, batsmen Shahriar Nafees, Aftab Ahmed and Nazim Uddin and all-rounder Farhad Reza were among the 14 who applied to return to the national team.               
	 P. Sen Trophy

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting goes past Border
                                                   Ponting goes past Border
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Birmingham: Ricky Ponting became Australias highest Test run-scorer on the second day of the third Ashes Test against England on Friday.         
	Ponting passed Allan Borders mark of 11,174 runs when he reached 25 but he added only 13 more runs before edging a catch to wicket-keeper Matt Prior off England seamer Graham Onions.         
	Former captain Border praised Ponting.         
	Clearly, I am a great admirer, having been involved in Rickys selection in many great Australian sides, and having enjoyed watching him closely on more occasions than I can remember as a cricket media commentator as well, Border said.         
	It is not just the number of runs he has made, it is how he has made them as a dominant force, leading from the front and scoring at a rate previous champions would have regarded as unthinkable.         
	Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland led the congratulations for his captain.         
	I have heard Ricky talk about being inspired to win the right to wear the baggy green when, as a kid, his uncle, Tasmanian fast bowler Greg Campbell, was chosen to tour England in 1989, Sutherland said in a statement.         
	Ponting moved up to third on the all-time list behind Indian Sachin Tendulkar Brian Lara.

	Nagpur: Paddy Upton, Team Indias mental conditioning specialist, stayed back in Rajkot, awaiting the report on the swine flu test done on him a couple of days ago.         
	Paddys baggage has come with us, but his travel plans will be finalised once the report is known, a member of the support staff told The Telegraph on Wednesday evening.         
	[Later, at night, an agency report quoted the districts chief health officer, A.S. Sanghvi, as saying that Upton had tested negative. There was, however, no communication from the Board.]         
	Sreesanth, it may be recalled, tested positive for swine flu in the lead up to the Mohali T20 International and had to be hospitalised.         
	Tests on some of the others, Gautam Gambhir, for example, turned out to be negative.

                                                     Moles: Not here to offer suggestions
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Andy Moles                           
	Port Elizabeth: Andy Moles, the Black Caps coach, has joined the Kolkata Knight Riders as an observer and will be travelling with the Brendon McCullums till May 5.         
	Im with this franchise at the behest of New Zealand Cricket (NZC) and intend studying how it works... Ill also be having a fairly close look at the Indian Premier League, Moles told The Telegraph.         
	He added: The idea, obviously, is to see if theres something to learn and then implement in the T20 game back home... Im not in South Africa to offer suggestions either to John Buchanan or coach Matthew Mott...         
	However, Buchanan (who heads the Knights cricket operations) said: Andy is around like any other coach and Ill certainly tap him, if and when required...         
	Moles may be particularly helpful to McCullum, the New Zealand vice-captain who has replaced Sourav Ganguly as the top knight.         
	Yes, there will be opportunities for us to have a chat... Ill be happy to help Brendon in whatever way I can, he remarked.         
	Moles added he wont be able to stay beyond May 5 as he has to return home and prepare for the second edition of the World T20 meet, in England, from June 5.         
	As the request to involve him came from NZC, the Knights have nothing to do with Moles expenses. The franchise is only helping him gain a better insight into the T20 game.

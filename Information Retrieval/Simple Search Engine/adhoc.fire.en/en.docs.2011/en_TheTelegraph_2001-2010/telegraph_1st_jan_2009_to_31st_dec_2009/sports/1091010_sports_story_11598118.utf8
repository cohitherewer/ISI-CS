The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal is too good for Safin
                                                   Nadal is too good for Safin
                      
	Beijing: World No.2 Rafael Nadal stopped Marat Safins Beijing revival in its tracks Friday with a clinical 6-3, 6-1 victory to reach the semi-finals of the $6.6-million China Open.         
	Nadal, playing his first tournament since returning from an abdominal injury, dominated a brief but richly entertaining encounter against former world No.1 Safin. He had served up 12 aces in his upset of seventh seed Fernando Gonzalez on Thursday but Nadal faced only one from the big Russian.         
	Elena Dementieva earlier joined the exodus of top womens seeds when she was upset 5-7, 3-6 by Polands Agnieszka Radwanska in the quarter finals.           (REUTERS)

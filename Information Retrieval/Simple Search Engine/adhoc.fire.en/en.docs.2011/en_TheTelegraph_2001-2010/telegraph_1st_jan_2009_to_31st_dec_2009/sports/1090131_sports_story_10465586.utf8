The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting tells team to decide on IPL
                                                   Ponting tells team to decide on IPL
                      
	Melbourne: Australian captain Ricky Ponting on Friday said that his overworked teammates will have to take a call whether to play in the forthcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) this season or not.         
	Its a fair way away, Ponting said of the IPL.         
	The second edition of the IPL will commence from April 10 and will continue till May 24.         
	Ponting also wondered that how many players would withdraw from the IPL after more than eight months of constant cricket and with the Twenty20 World Cup kicking off a four-month tour of England in June that will also include five Tests and seven one-day matches.         
	Were all going to have to make a judgement call closer to the time the IPL comes around, quot; he said.         
	Ponting also emphasised that the players and their franchises need to sit and work out how to go about it.         
	We might only be able to play the last two weeks and a lot of the franchises we play for might have no chance of making the finals.         
	Theres all those sorts of things that need to be taken into consideration and worked out between the player and the franchises I guess, Ponting was quoted as saying by an Australian daily.         
	The paper also said his deputy Michael Clarke is still undecided about whether to enter the IPL auction on Friday as his manager was busy working out some outstanding contractual problems.         
	Clarke, who did not participate last year because of personal issues, has a reserve price of $one million for the auction should he enter. Australias most expensive signing remains Andrew Symonds at $1.47 million.         
	I still need to play some cricket and that might be one of the options. At a guess if my arm is good I will go in the auction, yes. quot; (PTI)

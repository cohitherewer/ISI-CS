The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kallis, Clarke return for one-dayers 
                                                   Kallis, Clarke return for one-dayers 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: South Africa will be bolstered by the return of Jacques Kallis going into the Commonwealth Bank series that gets underway in Melbourne on Friday. Kallis, who has recovered from flu, will most certainly be playing in the ODI series according to a CSA release.         
	On the Australian side vice-captain Michael Clarke has been passed fit to play which means that T20 Melbourne hero David Warner has left the squad, as has standby fast bowler Ryan Harris.         
	Australia will choose from the remaining 12 with a final choice to be made between one of the seamers and specialist spin bowler Nathan Hauritz.         
	Captain Johan Botha was also optimistic about AB de Villierss fitness and expressed confidence that the right-hander would be involved in the Proteas bid to win the five match series.         
	We start the series at 0-0, pointed out Botha. We can put a lot of pressure on Australia if we have a winning weekend. At the same time it will allow the players to forget quickly about the two T20 defeats.         
	The first encounter in the five-match series takes place at the MCG on Friday followed by the second match at Hobarts Bellerive Oval on Sunday.

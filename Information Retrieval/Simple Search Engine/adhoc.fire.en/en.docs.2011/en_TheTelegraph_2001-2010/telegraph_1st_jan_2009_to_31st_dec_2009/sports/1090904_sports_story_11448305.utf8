            A STAFF REPORTER            ON TARGET: TFAs Robin Singh (from left), Irfan Khan and Jagtar Singh celebrate their victory over East Bengal at the Barasat Stadium on Thursday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh                           
	Calcutta: The good thing about aiming for the stars is that it offers you a chance to get back with a piece of the heaven. For the youngsters of the Tata Football Academy (TFA), Jamshedpur, it was certainly a divine achievement on Thursday as they not only beat heavyweights East Bengal by a convincing 3-1 margin, but also knocked out the 27-time IFA Shield champions from its 114th edition.         
	The stage was set for a East Bengal show. Under coach Subhas Bhowmick, the red-and-gold brigade left no stone unturned in the build up to the season, a residential camp in Puri and a practice tour on foreign shores (Myanmar) included. Add to that the inclusion of Mehrajuddin Wadoo, Subhas Singh and Govin Singh, fresh from their stint with the Nehru Cup winning India team. One wouldnt disagree that East Bengal were the favourites  not only for the match but also for the tournament.         
	But the kids (the average age being 18) of TFA undid all such calculations.         
	Subhass boys did manage to sneak ahead in the 41st minute of the first half through skipper Syed Rahim Nabi. A Saikat Saha Roy cross from the right was tapped in by an opportunistic Nabi.         
	But that was all for East Bengal. A TFA storm in the last 30 minutes faded every tinge of red-and-gold flavour that the 10,000-strong crowd came with expecting a victory in the their clubs season opener. First it was the industrious Jagtar Singh, who headed home a Raju Gaekwad throw in the 60th minute to restore parity.         
	Robin Singh, the tall and impressive striker from Delhi, was the architect behind the second and the third goals.         
	In the 89th minute, he made a mockery of East Bengals Saumik Dey, dribbling in and out past the experienced defender in the right flank before releasing a goal-bound cross which was headed in by Irfan Khan. Again in the 91st minute, Robin latched on to a through, outpaced the opponent defence and placed the ball neatly past Abhra Mondal to hammer the final nail in East Bengals coffin.         
	And as a token of appreciation for their superlative performance, the TFA boys left the ground amidst a standing ovation from the East Bengal fans. Thats a no mean feat either.         
	TEAMS         
	TFA: Ishan Debnath, Jagdeep Singh, Hardeep Singh, Gurjinder Singh, Raju Gaekwad, Siam Hanghal, Jaganath Sana, Subodh Kumar, B. Niroshan Mani (Irfan Khan, 84th), Robin Singh, Jagtar Singh.

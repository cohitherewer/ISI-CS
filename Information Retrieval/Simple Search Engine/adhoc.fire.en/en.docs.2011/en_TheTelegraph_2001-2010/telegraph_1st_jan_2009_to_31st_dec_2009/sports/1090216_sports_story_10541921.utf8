The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Birthday boy Karim pleased with gift
                                                     Birthday boy Karim pleased with gift
            A STAFF REPORTER             Karim Bencharifa                           
	Calcutta: Any gift from the players on your 41st birthday, coach? Well, they gave me three points. Can I ask for more, Bencharifa replied with a smile when asked whether there had been any present from Bhaichung Bhutia and Co.         
	The smile, in fact, was a welcome relief for the man who had to endure tense moments during the Sunday skirmish against Mohammedan Sporting in their 15th round I-League match at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	At the post-match news conference, the Moroccan was candid. Mohammedan Sporting played really well. After this match, they will get more respect from their rivals. They are not a team to be fighting relegation.         
	I am sure they will do better from here, Bencharifa heaped praises on Mike Okoro and his teammates. His Mohammedan Sporting counterpart Shabbir Ali also felt his team deserved at least a point from the match.         
	It was not our day, a dejected Shabbir said. We took them by the scruff of the neck, yet could not deliver the knock-out punch, Shabbir said.         
	Bencharifa, though, refused to buy the fact that Bagan were completely off colour. Yes, in patches, we were inconsistent, had some problems with possession, but we had the character to come out with smiling faces. And how can you say that Mohammedan Sporting had the better of the exchanges when their defender Sheikh Azim was adjudged Man of the Match?         
	So what was more satisfying? This perfect 10  Mohun Bagan recorded their 10th consecutive win in the ongoing I-League  or the Federation Cup triumph?         
	After a pause, Karim said: These 10 wins will come to zilch if we dont win the I-League. So my first target is to win the title.         
	The perfect 10 and all that can come later. And regarding the Fed Cup, I would say any title, however bad your rivals, is an achievement.         
	Bencharifa said he would have liked Sporting Clube de Goa split points with Churchill Brothers. But as long as we are winning I dont mind how others are faring.         
	As the Calcutta Derby is lined up for February 22, this tough match should actually help Bagan re-energise themselves.         
	We needed this thud to shake off our lethargy. We will come all guns blazing against East Bengal, Ishfaq Ahmed was forthright.         
	Guilty of missing the easiest chance of the day, when Bhaichung Bhutia set him up with only the goalkeeper (Naseem Akhtar) to beat, Ahmed said even he was surprised. Hopefully I will get it right in the next match.         
	Refereeing, meanwhile, came for some scathing attack from Shabbir. Very bad, I can only say. Bencharifa, however, was sarcastic.         
	It was as inconsistent as we were.

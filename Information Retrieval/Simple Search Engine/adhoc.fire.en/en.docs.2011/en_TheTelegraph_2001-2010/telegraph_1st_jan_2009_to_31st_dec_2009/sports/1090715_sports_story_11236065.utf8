The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Adrian Sutil takes accident in stride
                                                     Adrian Sutil takes accident in stride
                  Adrian Sutil                     
	Silverstone: Force India driver Adrian Sutil said he has discussed Sundays crash in the German Grand Prix with Ferrari man Kimi Raikkonen and there is no bad blood between them.         
	Sutil, running second, was exiting the pit in Nuerburgring when Raikkonens Ferrai bruised his VJM02 and knocked off the front wing to nix his point hopes.         
	The Force India driver said he discussed the issue with the Finn and there was no hard feeling.         
	We spoke about it, and everybody agreed its a race incident, Sutil said.         
	The youngster, however, conceded that the crash denied him and his team their maiden Formula One points.         
	Its a shame as at that time I was just behind (Felipe) Massa, who went on to finish third.         
	Obviously some drivers made good progress in the second half of the race, so I think seventh or eighth position would have been possible. I think points, definitely, Sutil said.         
	Sutil said after Felipe Massa went past, he knew Raikkonen was coming behind but still could not avoid the contact.         
	I knew he was there as my engineer had told me to watch the white line and that he was coming when I was on the way out of the pit lane.         
	I entered the corner first. Kimi tried on the outside, which was okay. But there was plenty more space  he could have gone to the side, because I was on new tyres and it was really slippery, Sutil said.         
	I couldnt have made any crazy moves, otherwise I would have lost my car.         
	When you see my on-board I took the corner normally, I tried to push to be able to have a good exit, but I was quite limited when I was already on the inside for the braking for turn one, Sutil said.         
	If I didnt try to accelerate out of the corner its not racing any more, I might well have just waved him by and said come on, pass me please. You have to defend your position, added Sutil.         
	Incidentally, it was not the first time that Raikkonen dashed Sutils point hopes.         
	Last year in Monaco, Sutil was running fourth with four laps to go when Raikkonen crammed his car onto Sutils, ending the Force India drivers race there.         
	Sutil was in tears after the incident even though Raikkonen apologised to him later on.           (PTI)

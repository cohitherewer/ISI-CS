                                                   Younis-speak
                                        Younis Khan    
	The following are excerpts from what Pakistan captain Younis Khan said, in Centurion, late on Saturday:         
	Just the other day, Id said that the country needed a few good wins ... Weve got one and Im sure there must be plenty of celebrations back home...         
	As for us, we arent celebrating yet ... Wed like to win the Champions Trophy, a tournament we havent won ... Were three matches away from doing so but, right now, Im a little worried about our last group match, against Australia (on Wednesday)... Wed like to make the semi-finals with an all-win record...         
	It was a good toss to win and India wouldve found chasing even 260-270 difficult ... Malik aur Yousuf ki batting zabardaast thi...         
	(Umar) Gul didnt have a good match, but such things happen ... If hed bowled well, then India wouldnt have scored more than 200 ... I dont think (Mohammed) Aamer got affected by the pressure, rather being so young, he probably got excited and tried a few things ...         
	(Saeed) Ajmal did a fine job, yes ... The good thing about him is that hes improving every day ... I dont talk much about him and Aamer as I dont want them to get affected by the publicity ... Let their performances speak...         
	There werent any exchanges between (Gautam) Gambhir and me ... I stay away from all this, lekin thoda bahut hota rehta hai ...         
	As for the pain in my fractured finger (little one on the right hand), its there, but Im glad I played ... Years on, my children can say with pride that their father played against India with a broken finger...

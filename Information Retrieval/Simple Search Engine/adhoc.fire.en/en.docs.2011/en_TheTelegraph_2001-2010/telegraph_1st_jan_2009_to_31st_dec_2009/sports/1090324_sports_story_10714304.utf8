                                                   Best Indians to tour NZ: Crowe
                      
	Napier: The Indian team led by Mahendra Singh Dhoni is the best to tour New Zealand and they can sweep the Test series if they retain their motivation, former Black Caps captain Martin Crowe said.         
	This is probably the best Indian team to have travelled to New Zealand. There is no doubt that it is the best Indian side I have ever seen, Crowe said.         
	Since 1976, when they last won here, they had wonderful players like Sunil Gavaskar, Surinder Amarnath, (Gundappa) Viswanath, Bishan (Singh) Bedi and Erapalli Prasanna all magnificent players. It is the best Indian side since then, said the former captain.         
	Crowe was surprised that it took India 33 long years to record their first Test win here.         
	I am certainly surprised that it has taken India 33 years to win a Test match here. When you consider Kapil Dev and his abilities to win a game, he didnt do that Though I dont think he toured here that much. There have been some great players who have come here from India in these 33 years. So it is a surprise, he told a cricket website.         
	Impressed by the quality of cricket dished out by the Indians, Crowe said he would not be surprised if India blanked New Zealand in the Test series.         
	India has the ability and potential to clean up 3-0 if they want to, if they are motivated enough, which they should be because all this helps in the rankings and they would want to be the No 1 side in the world, Crowe said.         
	You have got to be able to put these minnows away. New Zealand have to be regarded as one because they are just playing very poor Test cricket, said the former skipper.         
	According to him, the hosts got their team combination wrong and the batting order too was far from perfect.         
	Leaving out Jeetan Patel was a mistake Not having Tim Southee, a specialist swing bowler in the side, was a mistake James Franklin in the side at No. 6 was a mistake because he has clearly not proven himself to be a top-order batsman, because he has never been one, Crowe said.         
	Daniel Vettori should consider whether he himself should go up to No. 6 or whether Brendon McCullum should go up to No. 6. That allows them to bring in Patel and keep three seamers using Jesse Ryder as the fourth seamer, he added.

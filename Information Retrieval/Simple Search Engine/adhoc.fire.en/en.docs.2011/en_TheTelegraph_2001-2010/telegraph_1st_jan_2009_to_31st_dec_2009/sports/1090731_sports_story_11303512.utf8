                                                   Honour to race with the legend: Hamilton 
                      
	London: Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton said on Thursday it would be an honour and a privilege to race against Michael Schumacher following the Germans return to the sport.         
	Schumacher, now 40, retired from Formula One at the end of 2006 but is expected to make his comeback for Ferrari in Valencia, Spain next month in place of Felipe Massa.         
	The Brazilian suffered a fractured skull during qualifying for last weekends Hungarian Grand Prix.         
	Hamilton was only nine when Schumacher won the first of his seven world titles and began his Formula One career a few months after the German retired.         
	I am excited by the possibility of Michael Schumachers return to Formula 1, assuming it happens, but my thoughts are still with Felipe and his family following his terrible accident in Hungary, Hamilton said in a statement from his McLaren team.         
	Michael is one of the sports greatest competitors and a legend in his own right and it would be great to compete against him.         
	The whole world will be watching his return to the cockpit in Valencia and it will not only be fascinating to see how he readies himself for his grand prix comeback but also an honour and a privilege to race against him for the very first time, he added.         
	World championship leader Jenson Button described the seven-time champion as brave for coming out of retirement. Ferrari are lucky because they have someone in their team who can jump straight into the car and be competitive Button said Thursday.

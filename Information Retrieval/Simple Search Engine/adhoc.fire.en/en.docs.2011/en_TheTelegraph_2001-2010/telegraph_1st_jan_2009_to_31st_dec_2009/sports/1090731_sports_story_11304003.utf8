The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dipika moves into quarters
                                                   Dipika moves into quarters
                      
	Chennai: Top seed Dipika Pallikal was the lone Indian survivor to move into womens quarter finals at the 13th World Junior Squash Championship Thursday.         
	On a day when three of the top eight seeds bit the dust, Pallikal packed off Lana Harrison of New Zealand 11-1, 11-7, 11-7 in 19 minutes and then sealed a place in the quarter final with a 11-5, 11-7, 11-5 win over Yathreb Adel of Egypt.         
	Adel upset 18th seed Milou Van der Heijden of the Netherlands 11-4, 11-9, 14-12 in a second round tie.         
	Six Egyptians have booked their berths in the quarter finals, while Pallikal and Pakistans Maria Toor Pakay completed the line up. In the quarter finals scheduled Friday, Pallikal will take on fifth seed Nouran El Torky from Egypt and fourth seed Nour El Tayeb, also of Egypt will play compatriot Salma Hany.         
	Pallikals progress to the summit clash seems in sight as she has to play lesser ranked players in the next two rounds, perhaps before taking on the tough Egyptian rival, Heba El Torky.         
	Among other Indians in action, Surbhi Misra lost to Pakistans Maria Toor Pakay.         
	A dozen Indian men fell by the wayside having lost all their matches in second round.

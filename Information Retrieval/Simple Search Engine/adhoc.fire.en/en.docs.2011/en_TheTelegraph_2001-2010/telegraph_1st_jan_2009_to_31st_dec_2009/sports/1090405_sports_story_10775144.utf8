The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiwary, Saha in;   Dinda left out
                                                     Tiwary, Saha in;   Dinda left out
            A STAFF REPORTER               Tiwary            Saha                            
	Calcutta: Bengal cricketers Manoj Tiwary and Wriddhiman Saha found a place in the list of 30 probables named by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for the second edition of the ICC World Twenty20 to be held in England in June. Bengal pacer Ashok Dinda, however, did not feature in the list.         
	East Zone captain Manoj had a creditable outing with the bat and had been Bengals batting mainstay during the last domestic season. Manoj plays for the Delhi DareDevils in the Indian Premier League.         
	Bengal made a comeback to the Elite division in the Ranji Trophy this season and reached the quarter finals, where they lost to Tamil Nadu. They also reached the Vijay Hazare Trophy final losing to the same opponents.         
	Wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman has been very dependable with the gloves. Together with Manoj and Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Wriddhiman forms the nucleus of Bengal batting. Pacer Dindas form has been inconsistent of late. Though he stays in the scheme of things for the national side, his current form went against him during the selection.         
	Pacers Joginder Sharma, who starred in the inaugural edition of the tournament, and Sreesanth were left out of the list of probables. Issues relating to fitness ruled both the medium-pacers out. Piyush Chawla and Ajit Agarkar were the other prominent names that did not figure in the list.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Federers earnings touch $50m mark 
                                                   Federers earnings touch $50m mark

	New York: On the day that it emerged that Andy Murray had sung on a rock album, Roger Federer was out there on the Arthur Ashe Stadium, winning an opening-round match at the US Open that made him the first tennis player in history to earn the staggering amount of $50 million (30.6 million) in career prize-money.         
	Perhaps, at the moment of victory, Murray should have walked into the stadium with a microphone, to perform a karaoke version of Abbas Money Money Money.         
	Talking about money is rarely considered to be in bad taste in America. This must be the country that invented the practice of giving tournament winners oversized cheques on court, so it was appropriate that Federer reached his $50 million on this side of the Atlantic.         
	That figure is, of course, just Federers winnings on court; if you also estimate what Roger Inc has accumulated in endorsement contracts, appearance fees and other bonuses, he could have put around $200 million into his Swiss bank account. Federer sports an RF logo, but there are times, and Monday was one of them, when you feel as though he should have a dollar sign on the front of his tennis shirt. He defeated Devin Britton 6-1, 6-3, 7-5.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

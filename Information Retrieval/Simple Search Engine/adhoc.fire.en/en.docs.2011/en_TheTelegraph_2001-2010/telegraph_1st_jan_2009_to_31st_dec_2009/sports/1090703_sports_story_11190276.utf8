                                                   Gavaskar: Youngsters need to guard against fame and money
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Legendary Sunil Gavaskar Thursday warned against the danger of the club sidelining the country as a result of the success of the Indian Premier League.         
	Delivering the inaugural Dilip Sardesai Memorial lecture at the Cricket Club of India, Gavaskar said that while the IPL has enabled the players to take up cricket as a full-time profession, the game needed to guard against the youngsters losing their way and being lured by the fame and money offered by the IPL.         
	Today, there are many players in the IPL who are not in the India frame but are still making a career out of cricket. The parents are encouraging their kids to take the sport as a career option. But the worry is that the IPL could become the be all and end all for them, Gavaskar said.         
	Gavaskar is, incidentally, a member of the IPL governing council.         
	In our days, we took pride in wearing the India cap... Today the players are missing out on domestic cricket in order to prepare for the IPL.         
	This is a dangerous sign... Playing for India may not be the most important thing anymore for a cricketer. This is a danger we should guard against.         
	Later Gavaskar spoke to reporters on other issues.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On ideas like four-day Tests to protect the longer version of the game         
	If you take a look, most Tests are giving results in four days or four-and-a-half days. Probably thats why they have mooted this idea. I am sure Test cricket has a place of its own The players too realise the importance of doing well in Tests.         
	On whether IPL should be shortened to avoid fatigue         
	I dont think IPL can be conceived in any other way. The home and away concept is essential to it. This time it was played in South Africa, even there this (concept) worked Our team got outplayed, I would not look too much into it.         
	On Dhonis transition as a batsman         
	As a spectator you want to see him as a dasher because you want to get your moneys worth. But there is also the longevity (factor) (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni is perhaps cautious in his approach but he is working hard on his batting.         
	On Deodhar Trophy being dropped for 2009-10 season         
	I dont think its due to the IPL. There is so much of international cricket The Champions League, Sri Lankas visit and the tour of Bangladesh I am sure it will be there (in the coming seasons).         
	On Indians weakness against the short ball         
	Theres a lot of cricket been played where there were not many short balls, and so the balance tends to be on the front foot. Then when you face the short-pitched deliveries, you cant adjust to it all of a sudden. I think thats what happened (to the Indian team). I think there need not be too much concern about it.         
	Looking back at his career and ahead to his 60th birthday (on July 10)         
	The mateship and the camaraderie from the cricketing fraternity, but above all the affection the people of India have shown. No money can buy that spontaneous affection.

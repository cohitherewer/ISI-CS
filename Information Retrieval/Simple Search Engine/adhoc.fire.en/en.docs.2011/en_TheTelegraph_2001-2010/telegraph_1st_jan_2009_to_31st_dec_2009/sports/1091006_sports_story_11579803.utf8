The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC denies Taufel apology
                                                   ICC denies Taufel apology
                      
	Karachi: The International Cricket Council on Monday described as incorrect media reports about Australian umpire Simon Taufel apologising to Pakistan batsman Umar Akmal for wrongly giving him out during their Champions Trophy semi-final against New Zealand.         
	This report is incorrect. It has no truth, an ICC spokesman said.         
	The ICCs denial came after a media report in Pakistan quoted sources in the team as saying that Taufel had apologised to Akmal after footage replays confirmed that the Australian erred in ruling him out in the crucial encounter in Johannesburg.         
	According to Pakistan team sources, coach Intikhab Alam had a heated argument with umpires  Taufel and Ian Gould at the hearing, called by Match Referee Jawagal Srinath after the on-field officials reported that Akmal had shown dissent on being given out.         
	Taufels apology came after the footage of the match made it clear that Akmal played the Daniel Vettori delivery with his bat, but was given out leg before. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warne votes for the Super Kings
                                                     Warne votes for the Super Kings

	Durban: The Delhi DareDevils may be the table-toppers and they might have been the most consistent side in the ongoing Indian Premier League, but Shane Warne feels that the Chennai Super Kings, and not the Delhi side, will probably run away with the title.         
	The DareDevils are perched at the top, having accumulated 20 points with ten wins off 14 matches and looked a balanced side all through.         
	But the Rajasthan Royals skipper and former Australian leg-spinner thinks otherwise.         
	I dont think the Delhi DareDevils are the best side in the competition. I think the Chennai Super Kings look a better side. They are probably the favourites to win, he said         
	Warnes team, champions in the first edition of the cash-rich tournament, failed to reach the semi-final stage this year.         
	The Super Kings, who booked their semi-final berth Wednesday after beating the Kings XI Punjab, are placed second in the points table with 17 points.         
	The last years finalists skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni was naturally happy to be termed as the favourites.         
	It feels good when somebody reckons you as the favourite of the tournament, he said.           (PTI)

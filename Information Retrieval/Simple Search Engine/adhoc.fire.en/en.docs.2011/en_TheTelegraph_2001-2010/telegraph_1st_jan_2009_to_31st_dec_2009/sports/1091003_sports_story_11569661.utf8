The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We will play freely: Younis 
                                                   We will play freely: Younis 
    - Nazir, Aamer set to be back; Vettori wants to change script           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Johannesburg: For a change, a Pakistan captain actually has a problem of plenty. Usually, he has to contend with a dressing room within a dressing room!         
	No wonder, then, Younis Khan appeared relaxed on the eve of the Champions Trophy semi-final against an injury-stricken but not to be underestimated New Zealand.         
	Koi pressure ka sawaal nahin hai... We will be playing freely, Younis told The Telegraph on Friday.         
	Speaking at the Wanderers, he added: As Ive announced, Id like to win this tournament too (after the World T20 in June) for the country and in Bob Woolmers memory... Dekhen kya hota hai...         
	Younis hasnt yet called Woolmers wife, Gillian, but will do so if his team makes Mondays final. Ill then invite her to come here.         
	Pakistan have never before made the final of a Champions Trophy, while New Zealand, then captained by Stephen Fleming, won the 2000 edition in Nairobi. Back then, it was known as the ICC KnockOut.         
	Interacting with the media in general, Younis made the point that the wicket alone would influence his choice of the XI.         
	Its not that Ive got to field two (specialist) spinners or anything like that... Ill decide when I see the wicket tomorrow... Within the team, theres plenty of competition for places, he maintained.         
	Clearly, Mohammed Asifs impressive comeback, against Australia, has complicated matters.         
	Opener Imran Nazir, who missed the last match, is now available for selection. He has a few stitches on his (right) hand, but is fine otherwise, Younis, who is himself playing with a hairline fracture, informed.         
	Late at night, well-placed sources strongly suggested that Nazir and quick Mohammed Aamer would return to the XI, with Misbah-ul-Haq and Asif going back to the reserve bench.         
	Confirmation, though, was awaited.         
	Counterpart Daniel Vettoris problems are different  already without the explosive Jesse Ryder, New Zealand may have to do without all-rounder Grant Elliott as well.         
	Touch wood, nobody else runs into a fitness issue, Vettori, who is intent on changing the script, as he put it, quipped.         
	There was bad blood between Pakistan and New Zealand after their World T20 match (won by Pakistan), at the Brit Oval, over the ball-tampering allegation against Umar Gul, but Vettori hasnt raised it in South Africa.         
	As for Younis, he seemed surprised at a question relating to the war of words then. What row? Id forgotten about it... You (media) have reminded me.         
	The bitterness could have gone, but both teams will be seeking to prove a point, with New Zealand almost desperate to shed the under-achievers tag.         
	For that to be achieved, somebody like Brendon McCullum will have to raise his game to another level of aggression.         
	Pakistan, on the other hand, have a clutch of match-winners but it remains a temperamental team. Some, of course, believe that it cant be stopped once so close to the summit.         
	All of us said the Friday prayers at a mosque... I asked for the well-being of my country and my team... As Ive been saying, we need wins in big tournaments... Its cricket which unites everybody back home, Younis pointed out.         
	Both captains indicated that the toss may not play a significant role, but if conditions get overcast at the Wanderers, the ball could begin to do quite a bit.         
	Match starts: 6 pm (IST).

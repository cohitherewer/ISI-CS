                                                   East claw back on Day II
  - Ranadeb Bose scalps four, SS Das hits half-century       OUR CORRESPONDENT                                  
	Mumbai: An incisive spell of fast bowling by Ranadeb Bose and a determined half-century by former India Test opener Shiv Sundar Das led East Zones fightback on the second day of the Duleep Trophy semi-final against West here on Friday.         
	Bose picked up four for 70 and was well supported by his Ranji Trophy teammate from Bengal, Ashok Dinda (3/93) as East restricted the hosts to 282 in the first innings at the Brabourne Stadium.         
	West enjoyed a cushion of 111 runs but that lead was wiped out by close of play as East rattled away to 128 for three, thanks to some positive batting by Das and Rashmi Ranjan Parida.         
	Skipper Das, dismissed in the first innings for a duck, was fluent in his strokemaking during an attacking 56 that contained 10 fours while Parida was a bit unlucky to miss out on his second half-century of the match, adjudged leg before wicket for 47.         
	The dismissals of Das and Parida somewhat blemished an otherwise brilliant performance by East who now have a slender overall lead of 17 runs. Nevertheless, they have shown their intent to West through both their nagging bowling and scoring at a rate of 3.36 runs an over.         
	The first hour of play on Saturday will decide whether East are able to set a challenging fourth-day target.         
	Manoj Tiwary and Saurabh Tiwary, the two not out batsmen at the crease, would take comfort from the fact that the CCI pitch has dried up to a large extent.

	London: Arsenal return to Premier League action on Saturday when Blackburn visit the Emirates Stadium and coach Arsene Wenger is expecting another difficult game, particularly after three successive goalless draws there, against West Ham, Sunderland and Fulham.         
	Andre Arshavin should return and while Theo Walcott is in the squad he is not expected to start.         
	Cesc Fabregas and Emmanuel Adebayor are still absent but the key pair are expected to return early next month.         
	Everton, seven points behind Villa, are on an impressive run of form and should collect three points at home to Stoke.         
	Saturdays other games are Bolton vs Fulham, Hull vs Newcastle, Middlesbrough vs Portsmouth and Sunderland vs Wigan. (AGENCIES)

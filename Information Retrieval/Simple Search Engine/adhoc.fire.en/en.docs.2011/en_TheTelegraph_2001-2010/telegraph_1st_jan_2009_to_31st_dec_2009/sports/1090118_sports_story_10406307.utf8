The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal is wary of Andy Murray
                                                   Nadal is wary of Andy Murray
                      
	Melbourne: A lack of match practice and two months of recuperating from tendinitis in his knee should not affect his attempts to win his first Australian Open title, top seed Rafael Nadal said on Saturday.         
	Nadal, who ended Roger Federers 237-week stranglehold on the worlds top ranking last August, finished his 2008 season by withdrawing from the Paris Masters in October.         
	He missed the season-ending Masters Cup in Shanghai last November and Spains Davis Cup victory and has played just three competitive matches in 2009, in Doha where he lost in the quarter finals.         
	I was for two months outside of competition, so maybe I need a little bit more matches for (me to) get the rhythm, Nadal told reporters at Melbourne Park.         
	The tournament is very early in January. (It) seems like you arrive here without knowing exactly how you are.         
	You only have one week before, the one tournament before. If you win the tournament, you know you are playing well. I am practising well but I dont have a lot of matches to know exactly how I am.         
	But I am okay. I will try my best to be ready for Tuesday. Just try my best every match and expect (to) find my best performance.         
	Nadal also pointed to his potential semi-final opponent, in-form British fourth seed Andy Murray, as the player most likely to scupper his title aspirations in Melbourne.         
	Hes playing well. Hes playing good tennis, with confidence, Nadal said. He started the season very well, winning in Doha. He finished the 2008 season playing well.         
	When you win Cincinnati, when you win Madrid, when you win Doha playing against Federer, playing against Roddick, you are ready to win a Grand Slam.         
	So, if he plays well, he can win here.         
	Serbian pin-up Ana Ivanovic, meanwhile, said she was more than capable of the winning the Australian Open, brushing aside questions about her dramatic slump in form.         
	The glamorous 21-year-old made the final of last years tournament, losing to Maria Sharapova, then made her breakthrough by clinching the French Open.         
	But she crashed out of Wimbledon as the top seed in the third round then crashed to a qualifier at the US Open.         
	Despite the setbacks, Ivanovic insists she still has what it takes to win the big events.         
	I still put expectations on myself and there are things I want to achieve. I learned a lot from last year, said the fifth seed.         
	I feel like a girl who can actually win this Grand Slam. Like I said, I want to enjoy tennis and work myself into playing and competing. But pressure is always there and its also what I expect of myself and what I know I can achieve.         
	Asked who she feared most at the Australian Open, she pointed to the Williams sisters and world number one Jelena Jankovic, among others.         
	There are lots of girls playing very well at the moment, she said. Its the first Grand Slam of the year so everyone is kind of trying to get their form and to feel good about their game.         
	The Williams sisters, Jelena, Dinara (Safina), (Elena) Dementieva, theyre all playing well at the moment. Its going to be a very, very tough Grand Slam.         
	I think thats what makes it interesting for us, as the players, also for spectators. They really cant pick a sure winner.         
	Despite being thumped 6-3, 6-2 by Frances Amelie Mauresmo in the quarter finals of her only warm-up event at the Brisbane International, the Serb said she was in her best shape ever.         
	I had a couple matches in Brisbane, and I feel very confident. I feel very fit. I think actually its the fittest Ive been in my career so far, she said. Obviously, the last couple of days I tried to play lot of points and tried to implement things I was working on in match situations.

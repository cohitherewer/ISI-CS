                                                     Zidanes charity is more of a business: Dhorasoo
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Vikash Dhorasoo (right) with Rennedy Singh in New Delhi on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	New Delhi: Vikash Dhorasoo, the former French international footballer of Indian origin, is well known for his active participation against discrimination of all sorts and for his generosity towards street kids.         
	Dhorasoo, who announced his retirement from active football in 2008, has now stopped going to football grounds. I dont go to the stadium these days. There is too much violence, he said here on Saturday.         
	The former AC Milan star, who was in the capital along with India midfielder Rennedy Singh to take part in a programme organised by the Consortium for Street Children, said there was a lot of racial discrimination in European football.         
	Dhorasoo, who traces his roots to Vijaynagar, a small village in Andhra Pradesh, as well as Mauritius and was born in Le Havre, France, is aware of his multi-ethnic background and said that was the reason he decided to do something for Indian football.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On racial discrimination         
	Back in Europe we fight against all kinds of discrimination every day. Personally, I faced problems during my early days as a footballer. Those days, police and customs used to stop me regularly. But once I became famous, things became easier. Still, I feel bad for those who are not lucky like me.         
	At the moment, I am working against all sorts of discrimination. I write for a football magazine in Paris. I have also worked with the Paris Foot Gay, a local club exclusively for gay footballers to fight for equal rights in society. I also work with the mayor of Paris on some social development issues.         
	On Indian football         
	Please dont think that I am here to find another (Zinedine) Zidane. I am here for a cause. My ultimate dream is to watch an Indian player playing in the French league.         
	On his plans for Indian football         
	I am always ready to help Indian football. If the All India Football Federation (AIFF) wants me to do something, I am always available. I went to Fifa to discuss the possibility of working together for the development of Indian football. This is definitely not my last trip to India. I hope to have a partnership going with India.         
	However, people here have to change their attitude if they seriously want to come up in football. They have to work at the grassroots level.         
	Things he likes most about India         
	(Laughs) I love that Jimmy Jimmy song from Disco Dancer. But my daughter (Rose) likes that Bole Churiyan song. She thinks all those girls in the films are princesses. I have watched a lot of Indian movies like Amar Akbar Anthony and Slumdog Millionaire.         
	On street children         
	I was brought up in a small district in Le Havre and grew up in an under-privileged area. I want to give something back to society. At the moment, I am planning to build a French team for street children. Zidane also does some charity work but it is more of a business.         
	On Zidane and 2006 World Cup         
	Zidanes comeback to the national team was definitely not a good thing for me. He took my place in the World Cup team. I played with him and when he was not there, I took his place. But I still dont know what happened and suddenly I found myself out of the team. It was a difficult period for me. The French manager (Raymond) Domenech was a good coach but he let me down. I was his player but he did not play me in the World Cup. I also didnt get much support from my teammates. Still, the World Cup was a dream.         
	The best players of his time         
	I rate (Clarence) Seedorf and Lionel Messi as the best I have seen. Seedorf is simply too good. As far as Messi is concerned, I would not hesitate to walk any distance to watch him play. If you ask me about my football then I would say that I never dreamt of playing for AC Milan. When I started, I would have been happy to play for my local club.

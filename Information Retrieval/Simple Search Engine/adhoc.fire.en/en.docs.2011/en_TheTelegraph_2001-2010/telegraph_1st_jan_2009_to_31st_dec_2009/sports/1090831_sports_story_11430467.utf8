The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gary Kirsten is playing it safe
                                                     Gary Kirsten is playing it safe
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI    
	Bangalore: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), one learns, will soon initiate steps to extend coach Gary Kirstens contract.         
	For now, its till next March. Kirsten came on board in March 2008.         
	As reported in these columns on Sunday, the BCCI has (among other things) to look at continuity as the 2011 World Cup will begin just 11 months after the end of Kirstens existing contract.         
	Indeed, it wont make sense to have a new man in place so close to the most high-profile tournament.         
	Kirsten wasnt available for a comment, but a confidant of the South African did speak to The Telegraph.         
	Gary is the practical sort and he truly believes that six months or so is a long time in the life of a cricket coach... Its not that, going forward, he has negative thoughts, but wont say anything till the offer of an extension actually comes to him, the gentleman said.         
	As things stand, then, word is awaited from the BCCI.

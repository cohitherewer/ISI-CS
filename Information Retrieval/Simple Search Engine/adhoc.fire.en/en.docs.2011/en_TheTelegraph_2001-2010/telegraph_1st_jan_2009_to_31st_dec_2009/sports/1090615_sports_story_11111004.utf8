The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barcelona trip excites players
                                                   Barcelona trip excites players
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: La Masia, the FC Barcelona academy, will have some new visitors for a month from July 7. The Indian team will be having a preparatory camp there before they come back to defend the Nehru Cup in Delhi. The players are excited about getting a chance to visit the fabled academy.         
	Its a big opportunity for us. You dont get a chance to use the La Masia facilities more often. I am really excited about getting a chance to understand the Barcelona philosophy, India striker Sunil Chetri said from Delhi. Dempos new signing in fact eats, sleeps and drinks Barcelona. They are my favourite team. I hope to learn something form the trip.         
	Chetri, however, is not sure whether he will be able to meet the likes of Lionel Messi and Andreas Iniesta. The club website says that the team meets on July 20 and leaves for London (to participate in the Wembley Cup) the next day. I dont think we will be able to meet them, he says.         
	Chetri feels that the camp will help them to improve. The two trips we had in Portugal (one before the Nehru Cup 2007 and another before the AFC Challenge Cup in 2008) made us different players altogether.         
	Syed Rahim Nabi also sounded excited about the La Masia trip, but feared that his club (East Bengal) might not allow the players to travel. I am keeping my fingers crossed. I dont know whether the club will allow me to travel. If I go, then I hope to meet Messi and Dani Alves. Together they form the best right wing in the world, Nabi said from Calcutta.         
	The Indian players who featured in the Santosh Trophy final  Subhashish Roy Choudhury of Bengal and Mahesh Gawli and Climax Lawrence of Goa  said that its a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.         
	I am excited. I hope to improve my game from the trip, Roy Choudhury said.         
	Gawli said that the Indian players were highly benefited from the Portugal trips. Hopefully, well be able to learn something this time, too. Thats the best thing about our coach Bob Houghton. He plans these exposure trips meticulously, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | This century is special: McCullum
                                                   This century is special: McCullum
                      
	Napier: New Zealands swashbuckling wicketkeeper-batsman Brendon McCullum Friday said he was relieved to have finally scored a Test hundred against a top side like India after scoring his first two centuries against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.         
	It has been so long between the hundreds. There were some 90s and 80s. No disrespect to Bangladesh and Zimbabwe, but to get one against a top quality side like India means a lot, McCullum, who made a cavalier 115 in New Zealands towering total of 619 for nine declared, said.         
	Mccullum said he would prefer batting higher up the order. You always want to bat higher because you want to contribute more to the side. But the way our batting order sits at the moment, with Jesse coming in at five and doing so well, Frankie doing well, and you have got Jake (Jacob Oram) to come in. So my role is to bat with Daniel and the tail, he said.         
	McCullum said despite picking up three Indian wickets Friday, it would be hardwork to get the Indians out cheaply. (PTI)

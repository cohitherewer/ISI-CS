The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Super Kings not good enough to stop Chargers
                                                     Super Kings not good enough to stop Chargers
                  Gilchrist                     
	Durban: Table toppers the Deccan Chargers fairytale campaign continued in the second Indian Premier League (IPL) with the Adam Gilchrist-led side beating the Chennai Super Kings by six wickets to maintain their clean slate here Monday.         
	Chasing 166, the Chargers rode on Herschelle Gibbs (69 not out) second half-century of the tournament and captain Gilchrists 44 off 19 balls to cruise to 169 for four in 19.3 overs to record their fourth win on the trot.         
	Put in to bat, the Super Kings had earlier posted 165 for six, courtesy Matthew Haydens belligerent 49 and Jacob Orams breezy unbeaten 41 down the order. Gilchrist and Gibbs were clearly in a hurry to wrap up the match and with both the batsmen going after the bowlers, the Chennai side simply had no respite.         
	Gilchrist hit Lakshmipathy Balaji for back-to-back fours in the first over to signal his intentions. The Chennai pacer had a chance to settle scores in the next over, but Balaji grassed a difficult caught and bowled chance.         
	Gilchrist was simply unstoppable thereafter, hitting the pacer for two sixes and a boundary in that over.                     
	Gibbs, at the other end, matched his captain shot for shot, milking 20 runs of a Manpreet Gony over. Their association had yielded 67 runs in no time when Suresh Raina stopped them from running away with the match with double strikes.         
	Gilchrist perished at short thirdman in Rainas first over and in his next, out-of-form V.V.S Laxman was caught at gully. Rohit Sharma and Dwayne Smith fell in quick succession but Gibbs stayed till the end to take the side home.         
	Earlier, Matthew Hayden muscled his way to a belligerent 49 while Jacob Oram hit a breezy unbeaten 41 as the Super Kings posted 165 for six.         
	Adam Gilchrist won the toss, asking the Super Kings to bat and Parthiv Patel tickled Fidel Edwards behind the wicket in the first over itself. The Chargers catching, however, was not up to the mark. Dropping Hayden  Gilchrist did a favour to his former Australia teammate  and Suresh Raina in quick succession proved costly as the left-handed duo cobbled a 64-run stand to prop up Chennai. Raina celebrated the life with a huge six off Rudra Pratap Singh, a treatment he later meted out to Fidel Edwards as well.         
	Hayden, who had warmed up with successive fours off RP, looked determined to make the Chargers pay for their lapse as he cut and pulled with aplomb.         
	Rohit Sharma finally broke the stand in his first over, catching Raina off his own bowling.           (PTI)

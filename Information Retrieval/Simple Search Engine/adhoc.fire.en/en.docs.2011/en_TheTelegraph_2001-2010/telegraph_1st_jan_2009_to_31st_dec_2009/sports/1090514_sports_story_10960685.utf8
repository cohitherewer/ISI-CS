The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahindra support for city clubs
                                                   Mahindra support for city clubs
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Mahindra United on Wednesday came out in support of the two Calcutta clubs, saying the national federation should compensate the clubs for keeping the players in the camp for a long period.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph, Mahindra president Alan Durante said he, too, has written to the All India Football Federation (AIFF) in this regard.         
	I think what Mohun Bagan and East Bengal have done is right, Durante said. Its time the AIFF understood the problems of the clubs. They should not keep the footballers for long periods in the national camp.         
	Asked whether he was in favour of releasing his players for the camp, Durante said: I am not against footballers going to the national camp. But then, the AIFF should compensate the clubs.         
	Four Mahindra players  Subhasis Roy Chowdhury, Steven Dias, N.P. Pradeep and Sushil Singh  have been named among the 27 probables by the national coach Bob Houghton.         
	The camp is scheduled to start on June 22 and the players will be released only at the end of the Nehru Cup.         
	While the two Calcutta clubs said they would deduct the salaries of the players for the period they would be at the camp, Goas Dempo Sports Club have also expressed their unhappiness over the national teams schedule.         
	I am not going to release the players for those preparatory matches in Portugal or Spain. As per the Fifa rules, the AIFF can only take my players a couple of days before the official matches, said Dempo coach Armando Colaco.         
	The AIFF general secretary, Alberto Colaco, refused to comment on this issue. I havent received any letter from any club. So, I am in no position to say anything, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mills, Butler return
                                                   Mills, Butler return
                      
	Wellington: Fast bowler Ian Butlers impressive showing in the just-concluded Twenty20 Internationals has earned him a place in the New Zealand one-day team after a hiatus of five years for the first three games of the five-match series against India starting March 3.         
	Apart from Butler, Kyle Mills, who had strained his Achilles tendon, also made a comeback to the ODI squad after a two-week injury lay-off to augment an already lethal Black Caps pace battery, led by Iain Brien, Butler and Tim Southee.

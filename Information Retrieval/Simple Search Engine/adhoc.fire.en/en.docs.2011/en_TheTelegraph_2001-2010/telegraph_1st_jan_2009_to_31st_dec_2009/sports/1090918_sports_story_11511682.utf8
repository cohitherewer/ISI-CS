The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Boys look to do it for Leander
                                                     Boys look to do it for Leander
            OUR CORRESPONDENT          Rohan Bopanna                           
	Mumbai: The Indian Davis Cup team are all charged up for their World Group playoff against South Africa, looking to win this one for the injured Leander Paes, captain Shiv Prakash Misra said Thursday.         
	Every time in the past Leander has done it for India. This time around he is not available and the boys want to do it for him. They are really charged up, Misra told The Telegraph from Johannesburg after the draw ceremony at the Ellis Park Indoor Arena.         
	Paes pulled out of the September 18-20 tie, to be played on indoor hard courts at the Ellis Park Arena, due to a shoulder injury picked up at the US Open where he lifted the mens doubles title.         
	Somdev Dev Varman, Indias No.1 player, sets the ball rolling in the opening singles against Izak Van der Merwe, while Rohan Bopanna takes on Rik de Voest in Fridays second singles.         
	Bopanna and Bhupathi lock horns with Wesley Moodie and Jeff Coetzee in the doubles Saturday while Dev Varman vs De Voest followed by Bopanna vs Van der Merwe is the order for Sundays reverse singles.         
	Paess absence might have slightly tipped the scales in the hosts favour but it is also an opportunity for the 29-year-old Bopanna to step up and prove himself. His singles record of 5-12 reflects unfulfilled potential. Prakash Amritrajs ineligibility allowed Bopanna to return to the team earlier this year but the wiry lad from Coorg lost both his matches against Chinese Taipei in the zonal second round tie.         
	This is the time for him to set the record straight. Bopanna might not have that many singles matches under his belt, yet his height (63) and booming serves would suit the local conditions  the high altitude, which means faster-travelling balls  better than Dev Varmans counter-punching style.         
	In the Davis Cup, Bopanna has a 2-1 win-loss record. The only, however minor, drawback could be Bhupathis joining the team only on the eve of the tie. Interestingly, Bhupathi and Moodie played together for a few weeks in early 2008 while Bopanna partnered Coetzee in the Auckland tournament in January this year.         
	Both India and South Africa are aiming to advance to the World Group for the first time since 1998. The hosts have a 2-0 head-to-head record against India. South Africas campaign will revolve around De Voest, their top player with a world ranking of 189 and a career-best ranking of 110.         
	The 29-year-old De Voest has been the teams linchpin in recent years, going 14-6 in singles and 7-0 in doubles, partnering Coetzee mostly. Ominously for India, he has lost only one of his last 17 singles matches since 2007.

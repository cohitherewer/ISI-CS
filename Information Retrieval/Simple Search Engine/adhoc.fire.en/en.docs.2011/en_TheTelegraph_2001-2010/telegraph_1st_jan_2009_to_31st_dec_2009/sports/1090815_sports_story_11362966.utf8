The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | City eye upward thrust 
                                                   City eye upward thrust 
                      
	London: The Premier League starts again this weekend with the opening matches likely to provide the first hints of whether there could be a fresh challenge to the established order.         
	Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal filled the top four spots last season for a fourth straight year, but Manchester City are aiming to break that streak after spending about 100 million on five players.         
	City, who are likely to spend more before the transfer window closes on August 31, could reinforce their credentials as the team most likely to break into those Champions League qualifying spots with victory at Blackburn on Saturday.         
	Last seasons runners-up Liverpool have been unusually quiet in the transfer market and will again rely heavily on the form and fitness of captain Steven Gerrard and striker Fernando Torres  starting at Tottenham on Sunday.         
	Chelsea have yet another new manager  the fifth in two years  with former AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti tasting English football for the first time. Despite the massive wealth of owner Roman Abramovich, the Blues have been low-key in the transfer market with their main signing being Yuri Zhirkovs move from CSKA Moscow.         
	Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger will again rely on his youngsters with Ajax defender Thomas Vermaelen being his only significant acquisition so far.         
	The last time United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool were split was 2005 when Everton finished fourth. Although Everton, Tottenham and Aston Villa will again be striving to break into the top four and capture a Champions League spot, they now risk being overtaken by City.

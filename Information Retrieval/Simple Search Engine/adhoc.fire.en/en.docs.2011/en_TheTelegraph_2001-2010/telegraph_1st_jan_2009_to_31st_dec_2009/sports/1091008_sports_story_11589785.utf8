                                                     Bhullar confident of good show
                  Gaganjeet Bhullar                     
	New Delhi: Youngster Gaganjeet Bhullar goes into the Indian Open golf tournament as the favourite for the title, what with the absence of Jeev Milkha Singh and the other big names struggling for form.         
	Stalwarts like Jeev, Jyoti Randhawa and Shiv Kapur have decided to give the $1.25 million tournament a miss and, with other Indians like Arjun Atwal and S.S.P. Chowrasia out of form, Bhullar is being seen as the top contender in the tournament that tees off at the DLF Golf and Country Club Thursday.         
	But the Kapurthala-pro, whos had a brilliant run this year, feels no pressure of burden.         
	There is absolutely no pressure on me, Bhullar said. I have always loved playing here and it rather acts as a motivating factor for me. I have some very good memories here and I would like to make myself counted again.         
	If I can win in Indonesia then there is no reason why I cant do it here, added Bhullar, who will tee-off with Swede Daniel Chopra and Thai Thaworn Wiratchant.         
	Defending champion Liang Wen-Chong of China has also decided to give this years tournament a miss.         
	Atwal, who is still recuperating from a shoulder injury, said he doesnt have any expectations and is happy to be back on the greens.         
	Playing for the first time in India, US Open 2005 winner Michael Campbell of New Zealand is hoping to return to form with victory here. (PTI)

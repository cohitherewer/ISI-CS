                                                   Veterans hail rise 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India making it to the Davis Cup World Group after a gap of 11 years is a tremendous result, said India tennis legends Sunday after Somdev Dev Varmans win saw the team through. While Jaidip Mukerjea believes this might lead to the beginning of a new era in Indian tennis after Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi, Akhtar Ali said the result would definitely help in the growth of the game in the country.               
	The following is what they had to say (alphabetically):               
	Akhtar: Somdev was simply fabulous today. He showed character. It feels great to learn that a boy who trained under me has helped India qualify for the World Group. It was quite exciting to see him playing so aggressively. He never gave up and came back strongly although, at one moment, he was two sets down. He showed how strong he is both mentally and physically. But, I believe the man who gave us the momentum is Rohan Bopanna.         
	Naresh Kumar: Its a good day for Indian tennis. Full marks to Somdev. I should mention that Bopanna played a big role in this playoff He was simply superb. He showed his potential  But its a shame that he is playing doubles I think he should concentrate more on the singles game. Somdev too played well. But I think the main thing for Somdev is that there is still scope for improvement. Though the result is good for Indian tennis, I think this is a shallow team. If you take away Somdev then there is nothing left in it. I feel we should work on a long-term plan. Its good that talented youngsters like Yuki Bhambri are coming into the game. But we need at least 10 more Bhambris.         
	Jaidip: I am very impressed with Bopannas performance. He defeated the South African No.1 Its not easy beating a South African in South Africa. The World Group is obviously a tough thing with world class players playing But I feel just qualifying is a great achievement in itself.

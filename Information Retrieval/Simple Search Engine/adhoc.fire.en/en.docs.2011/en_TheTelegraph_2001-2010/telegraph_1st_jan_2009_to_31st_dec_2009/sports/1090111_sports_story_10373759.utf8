The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kevin didnt try enough: Steve
                                                   Kevin didnt try enough: Steve
                      
	Melbourne: Steve Waugh, one of the most successful international captains of all time, has blamed Kevin Pietersen for taking English cricket a step backwards in a situation which he felt was not so terrible.         
	Yes, I think so. It didnt look like it was a terrible situation. It does take a while to work with someone. I mean, youre not just going to come on board as a captain and work smoothly and fit in exactly the way the coach wants, the former Australia skipper said.         
	Pietersen quit the captaincy after leading England in just three Tests as he fell out with coach Peter Moores.         
	There are probably six to 12 months at least, so there is that certain period of time where theres a bit of adjustment needed. Youve got to get used to the way people operate. So I think they really didnt probably give each other enough of an opportunity to do that, Waugh was quoted as saying by a newspaper.         
	The former Australia skipper, who led his team to 40 wins in his 53 Tests between 1999 and 2004, said the entire issue was a setback for English cricket.         
	In the end, both suffered. Kevin had to resign from the captaincy and Peter Moores has lost a coaching job, so no ones a winner and it really puts England one step further back than theyd like to be, Waugh said.         
	Waugh does not feel that Pietersens presence in the dressing room would affect the team.         
	Theyre pretty hard-nosed and thick-skinned and theyre used to a lot of these distractions around the team. Theyll get on with playing cricket and theyll embrace him as a great, great batsman, which he is and I think it will be pretty soon forgotten.

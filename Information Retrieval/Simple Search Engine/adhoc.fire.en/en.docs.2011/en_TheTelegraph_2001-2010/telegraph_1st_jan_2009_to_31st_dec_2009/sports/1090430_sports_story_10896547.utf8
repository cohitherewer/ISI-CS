                                                     KKR fall to spin challenge
            A CORRESPONDENT            Royal Challengers Bangalores Sreevats Goswami plays a shot in Durban on Wednesday. (AFP)                           
	The Kolkata Knight Riders failed yet again, this time in the battle of the two bottom-rung teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL) at Kingsmead. Royal Challengers Bangalore showed more hunger and were amply rewarded in the end.         
	Set a target of 140, the Royal Challengers Bangalore won by five wickets with a ball to spare. They needed 10 off the final over bowled by Chris Gayle after Ishant Sharma had given away only three in the 19th. Mark Boucher scored 12 in four balls to carry them home. His cool composure prevailed as the South African remained unbeaten on 25 off 13 deliveries and was adjudged the Man of the Match.         
	Manish Pandey, the other not out batsman, faced the first ball in the final over.         
	The Bangalore franchises task was made easier by a rollicking 69-run opening stand between Jacques Kallis and Sreevats Goswami. The Bengal wicketkeeper-batsman played a solid knock of 43 off 46 balls that included six boundaries. He combined discipline with aggression and waited for the loose deliveries. The Man of the Match award could easily have been his after he had taken an outstanding catch in the deep to dismiss dangerman Gayle.         
	Everything fell into place for the Royal Challengers Bangalore on Wednesday. They read the wicket perfectly and wrested the initiative from the outset.         
	On a turning wicket, the Knight Riders strangely decided to leave out their best bet, Ajantha Mendis. While Gayle, Murali Kartik and Brad Hodge, who picked three wickets, bowled their quota of overs, Ashok Dinda did not get a chance to bowl. Why was he then picked? So much for the Knight Riders planning!         
	Going in with three specialist spinners, the Royal Challengers Bangalore had a surprise in store when they opened the bowling with Kevin Pietersen and Roelof van der Merwe. The introduction of spin at both ends, no doubt, left the Knight Riders bewildered.         
	The start was ominous with Pietersen dismissing Brendon McCullum off the first ball of the match. Not for the first time did the former England captain strike in his first over in this tournament. Gayle, however, didnt look bothered by all this. He was in his elements, pulling and driving with elan.         
	As Pietersen switched to pace, Brad Hodge got into the act taking 14 runs off Pankaj Singhs first over. Forty four runs came off the first five overs and it seemed the Knight Riders had made up for their early loss. Pietersen switched back to spin and the introduction of Anil Kumble paid off. Hodge was dismissed almost immediately as the former India captain was on target straightaway.         
	Sourav Ganguly failed to make an impact as he pulled a short one from Praveen Kumar straight to deep square leg.

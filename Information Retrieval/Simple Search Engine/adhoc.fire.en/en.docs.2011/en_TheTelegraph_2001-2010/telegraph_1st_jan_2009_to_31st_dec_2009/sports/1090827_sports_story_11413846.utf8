The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lebanon and Syria ready for skirmish
                                                   Lebanon and Syria ready for skirmish
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The crucial Nehru Cup encounter between Syria and Lebanon to be played on Thursday could turn out to be more than a football match.         
	Given the background of the two neighbouring nations, the match promises to develop into a volatile sporting clash on the Ambedkar pitch.         
	Though both the coaches decided to play down the political rivalry between the two countries that resulted in military conflicts for around 30 years, the players are expected to give their best. So fierce was the political rivalry that they didnt play each other on their home soils for years.         
	Previous matches took place elsewhere in the Middle East.         
	Early this year, when Lebanon hosted Syria in the Asia Cup qualifiers in Sidon and lost 0-2, the match was played in front of an empty stadium because of security reasons. The only spectators were a handful of journalists and a few officials from the football federation.         
	So bitter is the relationship between the two countries that when some Syrian players reportedly fell ill because of food poisoning and were taken to the hospital during the Sidon match, the Syrian team doctor called the poisoning highly suspicious.         
	The Lebanese officials were quick to promise an investigation, but whether in politics or football, the essence of the Syrian-Lebanese relations still lies in a deep and all-pervasive lack of trust. The Lebanon coach, Emile Rustom said there was no point trying to magnify the problems between the two countries in view of this match. We need to win to stay in contention. My boys will be totally charged up to get three points from Thursdays match.         
	Some of my boys are fasting because of Ramadan. But they, too, will go all out for a victory, the Lebanon coach added.         
	The Syrian coach, Fajer Ebrahim was of the opinion that his team would win the tie comfortably as a better team. We are a better team and beat them at their home ground also.

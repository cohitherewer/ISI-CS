                                                   Avik is slightly better
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Avik Chowdhury is responding to the treatment and the all-rounders overall condition has improved since he met with an accident Sunday.         
	S.B. Purakayastha, CEO of Ruby Hospital where Chowdhury is admitted, said on Tuesday: The good news is that theres continued improvement in his condition. He is responding well to the medications and we are hopeful about his recovery.         
	He further added that Chowdhury responded to verbal commands Tuesday and even managed to move his hands a little. However, the lower portion of his body is still paralysed. Our first priority is to ensure his safety Once that is taken care of, we can begin focussing on the lower portion, he said.         
	Purakayastha also told reporters that the cricketer has been able to maintain stability after the doctors stopped some of his medicines. Weve started feeding him and the positive thing is that he is being able to retain it, he added.         
	Asked if there was any chance of Chowdhury being released from the ventilator, Purakayastha said: Thats still not certain. We have to keep a close watch on his recovery. But what is good is that he is less critical now, and his hands are responding.         
	Meanwhile, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), which has pledged support to the injured cricketer, are contemplating taking the help of the likes of Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble to seek the help of specialist Rajsekhar Reddy.         
	According to sources, the CAB are also mulling to shift the cricketer out of the city for better medical facilities. National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) in Bangalore tops the list of preferences.

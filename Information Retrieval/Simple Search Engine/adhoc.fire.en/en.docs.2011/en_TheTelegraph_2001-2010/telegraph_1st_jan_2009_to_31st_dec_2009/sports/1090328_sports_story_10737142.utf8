The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Churchill can clinch it today
                                                   Churchill can clinch it today
            OUR CORRESPONDENT IN MUMBAI AMP; A STAFF REPORTER IN CALCUTTA                      
	Churchill Brothers can win their maiden I-League title in Mumbai on Saturday. A victory over Air India in their penultimate match and loss for Sporting Clube de Goa and Mohun Bagan in Margao and Ludhiana respectively, will see Churchill seal the issue. The Goan sides last match against Mohammedan Sporting in Goa will be only of academic interest. It will be party time for countrys only family club. Thats for sure.         
	Sporting Clube, who host Mahindra United on Saturday, are three points adrift of their city rivals at 39, while Bhaichung Bhutias Bagan, playing JCT in Ludhiana, have 36 points, but have two games in hand on their nearest rivals.         
	Tomorrow (Saturday) is like a final for us. If we win, the league is ours, Churchills super marksman Odafe Okolie said on the eve of the match.         
	The 24-year-old, remembers only too well the slip between the cup and the lip last season when Dempo pipped them at the post. We missed the title by two goals. We and Dempo had equal points but Dempo had a better goal difference. This time, however, we are leading and by Gods glory we can win.         
	So whats the secret behind Churchills superb run this year? The camaraderie among the players, is how Odafe puts it. We are a good team, a good mix of foreigners and local players, particularly the young (homegrown) players. Everybody is fighting and not ready to give up, he said.         
	Churchills Serbian coach, Zoran Djordjevic had a word of caution, though.         
	All that I tried to do was to keep the players relaxed because pressure is a dangerous thing. And Air India can be dangerous too, because they are fighting relegation and would try their best to pull us down, Zoran said.         
	Yes! Thats what  Air India upstaging Churchill  something Karim Bencharifa would be hoping for. The Bagan coach however wants us to believe that his mind wont be at the Cooperage and his team is motivated enough to log full points. I am not at all bothered about what Churchill do on Saturday. We are in Ludhiana and will give our best, Bencharifa said. Incidentally, the Moroccan was the Churchill coach last season when Dempo had the last laugh.         
	Bagan may go for Shylo Malsawmtluanga in place of James Singh as the wide man on the right and Rahul Kumar may get the nod ahead of Habibur Rahman in the right back position. And as usual the onus will be on Bhaichung and Jose Ramirez Barreto to deliver.         
	For JCT, a win on Saturday will see them move up on the points table  they are 10th with 21 points from 19 matches. The Ludhiana side will be missing frontliner Baljit Singh Saini (double booking) and Julius Akpele (injury).

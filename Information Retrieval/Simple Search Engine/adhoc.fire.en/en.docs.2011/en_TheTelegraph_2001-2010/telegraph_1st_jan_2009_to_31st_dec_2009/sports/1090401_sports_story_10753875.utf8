The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mendis lying low for now
                                                   Mendis lying low for now
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Calcutta: Duleep Mendis powers as Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) chief executive officer have been clipped by the new dispensation, but the former captain has, for now, taken a wait-and-watch policy.         
	Mendis intends seeing how things play out... Apparently, he doesnt want to take any decision in haste, a top SLC source told The Telegraph.         
	The new chairman, Somachandra de Silva, and the interim committee have appointed one-time manager and a former air force officer, Ajit Jayasekara, as the additional CEO. He may assume office on Wednesday.         
	Administration has been taken away from Mendis and given to Jayasekara, who will also oversee security, a new portfolio, so to say... Cricketing matters are still with Mendis, but his standing has taken a big hit, the source added.         
	Mendis contract is till the end of the year. Its to be seen whether hell stay rooted till then. Of course, a golden handshake could well be offered in the near future.

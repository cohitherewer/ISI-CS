                                                     Happy for boys: Bob
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                
	New Delhi: There were ecstatic scenes at the Ambedkar Stadium on Monday after India defeated Syria to lift the Nehru Cup for the second time in a row.         
	So delighted were the All India Football Federation (AIFF) officials that president-in-charge Praful Patel wasted no time in announcing cash prizes for the team within minutes of the triumph.         
	Apart from the $40,000 prize money, Patel said each member of the team, including the support staff, would be given Rs 2 lakh each. Goalkeeper Subrata Paul and skipper Bhaichung Bhutia, will receive special cash awards of Rs 5 lakh each.         
	Throughout the celebrations and the prize distribution ceremony, coach Bob Houghton chose to remain in the background with a smile upon his face. However, he spoke at length on the achievement during the news conference.         
	A composed Houghton praised the team as a whole. It is a good group of boys. They give their hundred per cent in training and while playing. Actually, they back each other and play for each other. I am very happy for them.         
	The coach said: I would have preferred to win in 90 minutes. Tiebreakers can be very exciting but we should have won in 90 minutes.         
	On Paul, the coach said: He has been a revelation. He has had a great tournament and he was simply outstanding.         
	Captain Bhaichung Bhutia, who was named Man of the Tournament, too praised Paul. He is very good but I know his best is yet to come. He will improve more and more in the next four to five years.         
	Bollywood star Salman Khan, who saw the final, was named brand ambassador of the AIFF by Praful Patel.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mani blames India for Cup shift
                                                   Mani blames India for Cup shift
                      
	Abu Dhabi: A former president of crickets governing body Sunday accused India of being behind the decision to shift World Cup 2011 matches away from Pakistan which has further isolated the troubled country.         
	The decision to move the World Cup out of Pakistan was ill-conceived and taken in haste and I am afraid to say that India has a big hand in this (decision), Ehsan Mani, former president of the International Cricket Council (ICC), said.         
	The ICC last month stripped Pakistan of its share of World Cup matches, citing the uncertain security situation in the country as the reason for its decision. The matches will now be held in India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.         
	Mani, who is from Pakistan, said the decision on the World Cup was not on the agenda of the meeting. (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev is in 4-way lead
                                                     Jeev is in 4-way lead
                  Jeev Milkha Singh during the first round of the WGC-CA Championship at Doral Golf Resort in Miami on Thursday                     
	Miami: Jeev Milkha Singh outshone Tiger Woods with a sensational seven-under 65 to join Major winners Phil Mickelson and Retief Goosen and Thailands Prayad Marksaeng at the top after the opening round of the $ 8,500,000 WGC-CA Championship here.The 11th hole bogey was the lone blot in Jeevs otherwise impeccable card as the India pro reeled off eight birdies on a breezy afternoon to soar to the top in a four-way lead.         
	Jeev, a 10th tee starter, began with a birdie but immediately dropped a shot but three par shots later, he fired a birdie hattrick to make the turn at three-under.         
	Jeev kicked off his front journey with a bang, reeling off a birdie treble and picked up one more shot on the fifth hole to settle for a scorcher of a card. In contrast, world No. 1 Woods shot one-under 71 to be at 40th position. A beaming Jeev later said he loved the layout of the Blue Monster at Boral.         
	Honestly, I love this golf course. I think it suits my eye. I hit the ball well and I think it all comes down to putting at the end of the day. I rolled it well, so Im pretty pleased with a 65, he added. Jeev was not too unhappy with his long game either.         
	It went very good too. I hit 12 fairways out of 14. I played a very solid round of golf and am pretty pleased with everything.         
	Ive been hitting the ball really well in the Middle East swing in Europe, and then after that, even in the LA Open. I worked quite hard last week on my putting, and I think its showing and hopefully it keeps showing, said the Indian. A veritable globe-trotter who criss-crosses his way to Asian, Japan, European and PGA Tour events, Jeev made it clear that even if he wins his PGA Tour card, he would continue playing international events.         
	If I get my card here, I would play my minimum. Thats what youre required to do. I would still play internationally also because playing in different conditions makes you a better player, he said.         
	Woods, meanwhile, made an unremarkable return to strokeplay golf, finishing on one under par and six shots behind the leaders. Woods was making his first appearance in a strokeplay event since his playoff win at the US Open nine months ago.         
	The world No. 1 cut short his 2008 season in mid-June to have reconstructive knee surgery before returning to the PGA Tour last month. Starting on the back nine, Woods bogeyed the par-three 13th after finding the bunker just short of the green and two- putting.         
	The 33-year-old took another four on his 13th hole where he found water but the biggest frustration for Woods, who made three birdies, was his putting.         
	I hit so many putts that looked good. I thought I hit my lines and thought I had the right speed but they just didnt go in, said Woods. Defending champion Australian Geoff Ogilvy, the world No. 4, finished one over par after producing two bogeys and a solitary birdie.

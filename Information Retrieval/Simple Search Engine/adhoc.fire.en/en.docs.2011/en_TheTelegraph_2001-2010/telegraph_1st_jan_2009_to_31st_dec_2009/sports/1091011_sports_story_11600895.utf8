            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: If the result of their first match is any indication, then the New South Wales Blues will be the overwhelming favourites when they meet the Sussex Sharks in the Group B Champions League T20 match at the Kotla on Sunday.         
	In the Sussex side, the focus would be on leg-spinner Piyush Chawla.         
	I have been working on my leg breaks and flippers and have also developed a special delivery. It should bring me wickets, the youngster said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clarke and Haddin ward off Windies
                                                                                                                       7                                      Clarke and Haddin ward off Windies
                      
	Adelaide: The West Indies proved Tuesday that they are no pushovers in Test cricket even though their captain Chris Gayle is a fan of Twenty20. Australia fought hard to save the second Test against the Caribbeans here at the Oval, finishing on 212 for five, chasing a target of 330.         
	The end of day score might suggest that Australia were always safe, but the reality was just the opposite. They should be grateful to vice-captain Michael Clarke and wicket-keeper Brad Haddin that they stood up to be counted, at the right moment. When the two joined forces, the hosts were reeling at 139 for five.         
	First-innings centurion Dwayne Bravo had given his team a sniff of victory with a three-wicket haul. That included Simon Katich, Michael Hussey and Marcus North, according to Cricinfo.

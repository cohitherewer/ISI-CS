                                                     Mickey Arthur: We were predictable
            A STAFF REPORTER            Mickey Arthur                           
	Calcutta: South Africa coach Mickey Arthur has said they were a little predictable in their approach during the Champions Trophy. He admitted that their preparation seemed perfect until it was squeezed in the vice-like grip of knockout cricket.         
	Against Sri Lanka and England we just didnt play well enough, its as simple as thatWe need to take responsibility  players and management  thats the bottom line.         
	Gerald (Majola, CSAs chief executive) and I looked for a series against India prior to the Champions Trophy and they ended up going to play in Sri Lanka instead. In terms of preparation I honestly believe we were spot-on. You never really know where your skills are until they are tested in a pressure situation, and we fell short, Arthur told the Sunday Times in Johannesburg.                 
	Arthur said he had been constantly on the phone with Graeme Smith since last Sundays loss to England.         
	We are each others support, he said of his relationship with the captain. Arthur felt South Africa could have approached the tournament differently on a number of fronts. Im a firm believer in the adage if it isnt broken, then dont fix it, he said. Perhaps we needed to stretch ourselves a little bit more and play more conservative cricket under pressure.         
	Weve been successful at chasing down totals but perhaps in competitive cricket like this we needed to go conservative and defend totals after batting first.           
	On having been predictable Arthur said: We need more attacking ability particularly from our third seamer. Perhaps we were a little predictable. Maybe they targeted Albie (Morkel) and did their homework against our spinners. Maybe we needed another attacking bowler.         
	He, however, retains a fierce loyalty for his players. I back the players weve got, he said. You dont become a bad player overnight because of two losses. I do think there are one or two areas we need to look at to give us a couple more options. For now, we need to be calm.

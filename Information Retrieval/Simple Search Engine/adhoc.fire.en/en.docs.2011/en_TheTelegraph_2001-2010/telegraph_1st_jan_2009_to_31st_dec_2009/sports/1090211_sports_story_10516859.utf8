The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nehwal eyes March return
                                                     Nehwal eyes March return
          
	New Delhi: A shoulder injury may have forced Saina Nehwal to skip the National Badminton Championships but the ace shuttler is hoping to be back on court at the All England Super Series to be held from March 3 to 8.         
	I was feeling a slight pain since last May but I ignored it . And it was during last months Korean Super Series that I aggravated my injury.         
	But I didnt think the injury was bad and it was only Monday morning when my physio examined me and suggested it would be better if I skip the nationals or else it might affect my chances of playing in tournaments later in the year.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan have job at hand
                                                     Bagan have job at hand
            A STAFF REPORTER            Bhaichung Bhutia during a practice session at the SAI ground on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa said he was hopeful of taking the three points that will keep them in the title race when they face Dempo SC in their I-League Round XXI encounter at the Barasat Stadium Sunday.         
	With N.S. Manju likely to make a comeback from a short injury lay-off, the Moroccan said that he wanted his boys to be professional and deliver their best to ensure victory.         
	We know the importance of tomorrows (Sundays) match. I just hope we get three points from it, Bencharifa said.         
	According to him their 1-0 first-leg win over the Goan outfit would hardly make a difference on Sunday.         
	For me they are the best side. These are players who have been playing together for a long time and five-six of them are players who are very much in the national teams scheme of things Thats why they are doing so well in the AFC Cup he said.         
	Incidentally, Bagans 10-match winning streak started with their victory over Dempo.         
	The Moroccan is almost certain to have a full team, which will give the green and maroon brigade the upper hand.         
	Ishfaq Ahmed and James Singh will be the two wide men, while Deepak Mondal will fill in at left back. Habibur Rahman Mondal should start as the right back.         
	Manju and Peter Odafe will be marshalling the central defence with Jose Ramirez Barreto and Bhaichung Bhutia playing upfront. Dempo SC on the other hand are already out of the title race and, according to coach Armando Colaco, the Goans will go out and enjoy.         
	I have told my boys to go out and enjoy. I have nothing to complain of as they are performing so well in the AFC Cup, Colaco said after Saturdays practice session.         
	At this point we cannot even come second or third in this I-League and so there is no point putting so much emphasis on this tie. We are now focussed on the AFC Cup and we want to work towards that goal, he added.         
	With no John Dias (double booking), he will have two foreigners at his disposal  Brazilian Beto and Nigerian Ranty Martins.         
	Valeriano Rebelo, Dominic Noronha, Mahesh Gawli and Samir Naik are likely to man the defence. Climax Lawrence, Clifford Miranda, Anthony Pereira and Cressan Antao will bring up the midfield with Satish Kumar tipped to don the custodians jersey.

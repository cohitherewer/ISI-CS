                                                     IPL caravan hits the road with double header today
    - South African conditions pose a challenge for the teams                   Flintoff                             
	Cape Town: The second edition of the cash-rich Indian Premier League (IPL), a heady cocktail of cricket and entertainment, gets underway in its adopted home with a mouth-watering double header here on Saturday.         
	It will be a double delight at the Newlands Stadium on Saturday with back-to-back matches featuring some of the best contemporary cricketers in this slam-bang version of the game.         
	Under the iconic Sachin Tendulkar, Mumbai Indians will lock horns with last years runners-up Chennai Super Kings, led by the charismatic Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	And before the crowd actually catches some breath, maverick England batsman Kevin Pietersen will lead Royal Challengers Bangalore onto the field, hoping to shed last years laggard tag. The task would be easier said than done because Rajasthan Royals, under the wily Shane Warne, would be hoping for an encore and the defending champions would definitely love to start their campaign on a winning note on Saturday.         
	On last years form, Chennai Super Kings will be favoured to make a winning start to their IPL campaign, but Mumbai Indians have a couple of key factors going in their favour which could well make the difference. Tendulkar, who missed the first part of the tournament last year, is fit and available from the start this time. Shaun Pollock will be missed with the ball, but his presence as mentor and Jonty Rhodes as the fielding coach could be the key, especially since both are familiar with South African conditions.         
	The big addition in the Chennai ranks is Andrew Flintoff, who will be available for the first part of the tournament. His bowling, especially, could be a huge advantage for the Chennai team. Some of the Australian players, including captain Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey, are skipping the event, opting for some rest, while injuries will keep the likes of Brett Lee out of the event.         
	However, their absence has been compensated to a large extent by the inclusion of a host of Englishmen, including Pietersen and his talismanic teammate Flintoff.         
	Pietersen will be available for only the first two weeks but how quickly he adapts and inspires Bangalore may dictate how they start their campaign.         
	Having Kevin Pietersen as captain will be interesting, as he has knowledge of local conditions and of batting over here  and it will be good to have his experience, former India captain and Royal Challengers teammate Anil Kumble told a website.         
	Besides, this years IPL would blood a host of exciting youngsters, including South African sensation JP Duminy (Mumbai Indians), explosive Australian youngster David Warner (Delhi DareDevils) and unheralded pacer Kamran Khan (Rajasthan Royals). Warne scripted a rags-to-riches story last year by leading the Royals, cheapest IPL squad, to title glory but things would be tougher this year. The team would sorely miss last years best bowler Sohail Tanvir, which considerably weakens the squad.         
	In contrast, Dhonis Chennai Super Kings look determined to go one better this time and the inclusion of Flintoff would lend a formidable look to their batting line-up, which also includes Matthew Hayden.         
	Under their swashbuckling captain Virender Sehwag, Delhi DareDevils would also fancy their chances this time, especially after adding Warner and bringing Ashish Nehra from Mumbai Indians, which lends more balance to the side.         
	More than any team, it, however, would be a triumph of the indomitable spirit of the organisers when the 59-match razzmatazz finally rolls off the block.         
	Considering how the leagues fate hung in the balance after its dates clashed with Indias general elections, IPL authorities have moved mountains to make the tournament possible.         
	IPL commissioner Lalit Modi and his team burnt midnight oil first to find a base away from India and then make the necessary arrangements befitting an event of such stature. South Africa, set to host the 2010 football World Cup, sensed an opportunity to host a world-class event and both the government and Cricket South Africa went out of the way to facilitate the arrangements.

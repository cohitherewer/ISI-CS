The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Laxmi Ratan pulls out
                                                   Laxmi Ratan pulls out
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla has pulled out of the East Zone squad for the Deodhar Trophy, beginning on Friday, citing an injury. Shib Sankar Roy of Assam will be the replacement.         
	Theres a side strain, which has been troubling me since the Vijay Hazare Trophy match against Assam (on February 17). The injury got aggravated while playing the knockout stages of the same tournament in Agartala. After consulting the doctor, I have decided that it will be best if I dont play the Deodhar Trophy since I have been advised at least 10 days rest, said Shukla.         
	Shuklas inclusion in the zonal side saw quite a bit of controversy at the selection meeting. Bengal selector Sambaran Banerjee spoke for Shukla arguing Manoj Tiwary shouldnt be burdened with captaincy.         
	East captain Tiwary said Shuklas absence was definitely a loss for the team. Its bad news that he wont play for us in the Deodhar Trophy. I personally will miss him, Tiwary told The Telegraph on Thursday.         
	 East Zone play their first match against North on Saturday.

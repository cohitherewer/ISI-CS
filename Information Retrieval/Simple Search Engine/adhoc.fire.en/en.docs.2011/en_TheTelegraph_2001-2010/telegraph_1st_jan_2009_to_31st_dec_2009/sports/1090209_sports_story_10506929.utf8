	The Australian Open 2009 will be remembered as a milestone in the history of the game. It took tennis skills to surrealistic levels and ended the reign of Roger Federer. Rafael Nadals victory emphatically confirmed his No.1 ranking. He had conquered all three surfaces  clay, grass and hard courts. Federer has so far failed to add the French clay courts to his kingdom. The suspense grew as the tournament headed for a Nadal-Federer shootout and reached an emotional peak.         
	Federer seemed to have found his old magic as he cruised to the final with crushing straight set victories over Juan Martin Del Potro and a rejuvenated Andy Roddick in the bottom half of the draw. In Nadals half where the heavyweights Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Gael Monfils and Andy Murray were clustered, emerged an exciting new Spanish star, Fernando Verdasco, who ploughed through Murray and Tsonga to set up a historic clash with Nadal in the semis.         
	Verdascos five hours 14 minutes encounter with Nadal will go down as one of the greatest matches in Grand Slam history. The two left-handed mercurial Spaniards with similar styles took the game to uncharted territory. Like sorcerers, with a mere flick of the wrist they conjured up inconceivable angles from hopeless positions. They kept the ball in complete control with topspin slice and baffling swerve, topped with flat coupe-de-grace winners at over 160 Kph of pin-point accuracy. It was a stunning mind-boggling performance by both the Spaniards.         
	What we were watching was the style and the near impossible stamina and fitness demands for the top players of the future. In the end Verdasco succumbed to the experience and iron will of Nadal. But he had hit an amazing 95 outright winners against the greatest retriever of all times. With a better serve and a natural net attack, Verdasco could develop into a super Nadal.         
	The fall of Federer, who, but for Nadal may have gone past Samprass 14 Grand Slams, was sad. Nadal pinned Federer down to the back-hand corner with a deluge of deep, high kicking top-spin forehands. A single arm of even Herculean strength cannot punish a high spinning ball on the back-hand. At best it can only keep the ball in play. This brought about Federers downfall.         
	A double-handed shot can have the firmness and strength to strike aggressively. Considering Federers form in the quarters and semis, most of the old-time greats predicted a Federer win, possibly taking into consideration the five hour dip into Nadals physical reserves due to his gas guzzling style of play. Apart from Federers inability to tackle the high spinners on his backhand everybody seemed unaware of Federers mind block against Nadal. Sixteen losses in 19 matches is a crushing mental burden to overcome, even for Federer.         
	Federer can surely win more Grand Slams as long as the luck of the draw keeps him away from Nadal. Both Federer and Nadal will have to contend with the challenge of Verdasco, Murray, Tsonga, Monfils and Djokovic in the future. All are hungry and their games are ripe for Grand Slam success. 2009 will take mens tennis to its highest ever levels, with escalating demands on stamina and skill.         
	In sharp contrast to the men, the ladies failed to produce any great matches or throw up any exciting new stars for the future. The fading aura of the prodigious talent of the 28 year-old Serena Williams who won her 10th Grand Slam and 4th Australian Open was enough to snuff out the challenge of the dour Russian grinders. All three Russian semi-finalists were without the winning spark required to triumph in a Grand Slam. The Serbians, Jelena Jankovic  seeded first and Ana Ivanovic  seeded fifth, also failed to live up to their rankings.         
	Ivanovic has a powerful game but seems to be mentally fragile. With Sharapovas injured shoulder and Ivanovics failure there seems to be no glamour content left in the ladies world which badly needs a shot in the arm.         
	In the bleak Indian tennis scenario two Grand Slam titles  the mixed doubles and the juniors singles  brought much joy to Indian hearts and a measure of hope. Mahesh Bhupathi kept the Indian flag flying with inspired performances in both the mens and mixed doubles. In the mens doubles his partner Mark Knowles let him down or the Indian tally could well have been three titles. The mixed doubles against Andy Ram and Nathalie Dechy was totally dominated by the Indian pair. Maheshs deep powerful serve and divine backhand coupled with Sanias forehand overwhelmed the opposition. If Sania can improve her serve they could pick up more titles in the year.         
	Considering the long lay-off due to injury, Sanias performance in reaching the second round of the womens singles was commendable. She has a long way to go to catch up with her earlier rankings and one hopes she stays injury free during the year.         
	Sixteen year old Yuki Bhambris victory in the juniors singles is the best thing that has happened to Indian tennis in decades. It is very creditable indeed, and his parents who have pushed him through deserve more than a gilded accolade.         
	One hopes that support from all quarters will now be forthcoming and he will have access to the very best of coaches and physical trainers. The route from the junior to the senior world is tortuous and very complicated. To maximise his chances of breaking through, Yuki should employ a coach who knows the road up and has been able to steer one of his former pupils to the top 10.

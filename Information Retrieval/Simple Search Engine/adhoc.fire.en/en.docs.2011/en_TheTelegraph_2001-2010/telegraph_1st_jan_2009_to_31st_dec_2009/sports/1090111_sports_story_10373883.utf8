The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zimbabwe defeat Bangla
                                                   Zimbabwe defeat Bangla
                      
	Dhaka: Zimbabwe recorded their first win over a Test-playing nation since 2007 when they beat Bangladesh by 38 runs on Saturday in the opening match of a triangular ODI series.         
	Chasing a moderate Zimbabwe total of 205/9, Bangladesh lost two early wickets for just 10 runs and never recovered, finally being bowled out for 167.         
	We didnt bat well, we played a poor game, Bangladesh captain Mohammed Ashraful said.         
	Zimbabwe captain Prosper Utseya was the best of the bowlers with 2/22 in his full 10 overs, and made the initial breakthrough, trapping opener Junaid Siddique leg before wicket before Ed Rainsford bowled Mushfiqur Rahim, both for ducks.         
	Bangladesh slumped to 33/4 after opener Tamim Iqbal was run out on 13 and Ashraful (18) was caught trying to lofting an Utseya delivery.         
	Shakib Al Hasan and Raqibul Hasan steadied the innings with a 59-run stand for the fifth wicket but just when the hosts looked to have recovered, Keith Dabengwa bowled Raqibul (23) and Ray Price had Mehrab Hossain (2) stumped in the next over, with Bangladesh stumbling to 95/6.

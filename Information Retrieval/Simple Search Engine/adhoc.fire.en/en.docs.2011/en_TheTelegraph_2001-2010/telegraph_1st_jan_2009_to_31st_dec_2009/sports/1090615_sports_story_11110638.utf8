The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gayle wants to have final say
                                                     Gayle wants to have final say

	London: West Indies captain Chris Gayle would love to get the better of England when they meet at The Oval Monday in the Super Eight stage of the World Twenty20.         
	Earlier this season, England hammered the West Indies in both a Test and one-day series. It was an unexpected tour of England for the West Indies, only drafted in after Sri Lanka pulled out because of their players Indian Premier League commitments.         
	Gayle, who had to cut short his own stay in the lucrative Twenty20 event, then had his own commitment questioned after he said he would not mind too much if Test cricket died out.         
	But having hammered a blistering 88 in the West Indies defeat of Australia at the Oval earlier in the World Twenty20, Gayles enthusiasm for this form of cricket is not in doubt..         
	It would be nice to have the final say for the summer against England by beating them, Gayle, who revealed he might need an ankle operation, told reporters at the Oval.         
	This is the important one, they have been getting the better of us and its a must-win match. We have everything to play for and will give it our best. We are confident we can beat them and have done it before. There are no two ways about it, well have to step up. Its a crucial game and can put us through to the semi-final.         
	Gayle criticised the schedule, saying it had been unfair for his side although an International Cricket Council (ICC) spokesman said that all teams had a chance to request changes several weeks ago and that the West Indies had not asked for any alteration.

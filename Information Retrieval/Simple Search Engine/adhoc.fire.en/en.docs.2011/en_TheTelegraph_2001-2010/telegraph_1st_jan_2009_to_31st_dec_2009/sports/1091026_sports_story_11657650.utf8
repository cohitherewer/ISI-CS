The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Resurgent Westwood still ready to learn
                                                       Resurgent Westwood still ready to learn
            Oliver Brown            Lee Westwood                           
	On a soggy Worksop day Lee Westwood is, incongruously, the picture of urbane sophistication: white shirt, white tie, and a suit so shiny you can almost see the light reflecting off it. His publicity team at the Hotel Van Dyk greet him effusively. Champion, they cry, the champ is here.         
	Fresh from a serene victory in the Portuguese Masters, his first triumph on tour for two years, Westwood does everything he can to accentuate the impression of success. He is the world No.5, dont you know, and has been pumping iron since 8am. I had to put my two hours in, he explains. I work out better when Im watching a bit of MTV dance.         
	Westwood acquired this gym-rat routine the hard way. There are accounts of how, nine years ago, he was lining up a pint of Guinness at the Irish Open when a reporter asked: To be the best player in the world, do you have to be a fitness fanatic and a teetotaller? A few seconds later, a line of froth adorning his top lip, he replied: Theres your answer.         
	But during the precipitate decline in form that followed, the joke was on him. His swing was remodelled, his results suffered, his girth swelled. In his wilderness years from 2001 to 2003 he was cuddly.         
	Westwood has never been exactly sylphlike but it is disarming, at the end of this season, to find him being positively evangelical about a health regime. It is remarkable what a win, two near-misses in majors, and a whole stack of money can do.         
	Pressed on his advice to Rory McIlroy, the young pretender in the Race to Dubai, which Westwood leads, he says: I would work on my fitness a lot harder than I did. When you are in your 20s you feel bullet-proof, when you put your socks on you dont groan. You have to be an athlete now, to be strong. Im not saying you have to be fit in cardiovascular terms, where you can go out and run a mile in under four minutes, but you need to be strong and supple, which helps in the prevention of injuries. You always have to work harder than you think you need to.         
	Westwood hardly wants for an incentive, since his results on the course are about to make him preposterously rich. The Dubai Leisure Corporation might have cut the prize purse at next months world championship by 25 per cent, but the 36 year-old should, provided he wins the Race  formerly the Order of Merit  comfortably break through the 3 million barrier for his years work. Not bad for a quiet Nottinghamshire lad, who now owns a private plane with Darren Clarke and a sprawling estate on the outskirts of Worksop, his home town, formerly famous only for producing Batchelors soups and Donald Pleasence.         
	Does the money matter? Its not really high in my mind. The way the economic climate is at the moment, we are very fortunate to be playing for all this money. You see a lot of other sports suffering, people in other walks of life losing their jobs. So you have to keep a good reality check. A few people joined the US Tour because of the FedEx Cup money. Golf is relatively recession-proof, but we ought not to count our chickens too much.         
	This is why Westwood strives instead for a legacy that can last beyond the next pay cheque, for an accomplishment that defines the route he has travelled. The Lee Westwood School appears an implausible brainchild for somebody who escaped the education system at 16, but it is about to be brought to fruition as its creator seeks to cultivate successors in his own image.

                                                   BCCI to look into Deodhar dates today
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Finding a window for the Deodhar Trophy in the crammed 2009-10 domestic calendar and the approval and framing of guidelines for allowing the rebel players to join IPL franchises would top the agenda at the BCCI working committee meeting here on Thursday.         
	The BCCIs tours and fixtures committee had earlier omitted the inter-zonal limited-overs tournament from the calendar, a decision which came in for sharp criticism from former cricketers and the fans.         
	The BCCI subsequently announced that a final decision on the 2009-10 schedule would be taken by the working committee.         
	The decision on allowing the players, who aligned with the unauthorised Indian Cricket League (ICL) only to return to main stream cricket by accepting the BCCIs Amnesty policy, is expected to be a formality.         
	The players have already been cleared to play in other domestic tournaments and the IPL governing council, which met here on Tuesday, set the stage for their signing IPL contracts by announcing a salary cap  maximum Rs 20 lakh and minimum Rs 8 lakh.         
	A total of 79 cricketers have severed their ties with the rebel league and rejoined the BCCI fold.         
	Among them are Rohan Gavaskar, Deep Dasgupta, Dinesh Mongia, Reetinder Sodhi, Hemang Badani, Sridharan Sriram and T. Kumaran, who have all worn India colours in the past.         
	Besides the above items, the working committee will also take up for discussion the recommendations of the cricket committee chaired by Sunil Gavaskar.         
	Gavaskar and Co. had earlier recommended, among various things, that no overseas player should be allowed to play in domestic cricket, except in the IPL, and all players must play for their state teams when they are free from international commitments.         
	Thursdays meeting would be the last of the present Working Committee, and as such, the BCCIs finance-related matters including the annual report and balance sheet would be tabled.         
	The WADA issue specifically related to the whereabouts clause, that has been opposed by the top Indian cricketers, could also come up for further discussion even though the working committee, at its emergency sitting earlier this month, had come out in full support of the players.

	Nedumbassery: Former India Captain and MP, Mohammed Azharuddin Monday lauded team Indias performance  grabbing the top spot in the International Cricket Councils Test ranking and expressed hope that it would maintain the momentum in other forms of cricket as well.         
	It is really good to see them doing consistently well in Test cricket and also in the other forms of cricket, Azharuddin, who was at Angamaly in the Ernakulam district for a personal visit, said.         
	Hailing the performance of Sreesanth, who returned to the team after 19 months and came up with a sterling performance in the second Test to win the Man-of-the-Match award, he said: Sreesanth needs to put in more hard work to ensure a permanent place in the team.         
	Sreesanth was a talented bowler and should keep his focus on the game to be a permanent member, he added.         
	Pointing out that there is bright future for cricket, Azharuddin said Mumbais Rohit Sharma and Karnatakas Manish Pandey were talented young cricketers. (PTI)

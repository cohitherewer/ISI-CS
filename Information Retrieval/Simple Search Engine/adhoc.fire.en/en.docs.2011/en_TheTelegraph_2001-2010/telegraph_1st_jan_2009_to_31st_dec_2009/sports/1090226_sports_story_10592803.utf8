	New Delhi: Dempo Sport Clubs dream of qualifying for the AFC Champions League went up in smoke after the Goan side went down 0-3 to Al Sharjah in the one-off qualifier at the Sharjah Stadium on Wednesday.         
	Two goals in the first half and the third after the change of ends dashed Dempos hopes of becoming the first Indian club to qualify for the prestigious Champions League.         
	Dempo, missing Mboyo Iwomi, Joaquim Abranches and Dominic Noronha, conceded the first goal in the 12th minute when Brazilian striker Anderson found the net.         
	Another Brazilian import, striker Jean Carlos, doubled the margin in the 34th minute and Dempo went to break staring down the barrel.         
	The visitors hope of staging a comeback was completely destroyed in the 55th minute when Salem Saif scored the third.           (PTI)

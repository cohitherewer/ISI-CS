                                                   United make a point
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: United SC held fancied Dempo SC to a goalless draw in their I-League encounter at the Barasat Stadium on Saturday. The one point from the match took United SCs tally to 22 points from 20 games and will help them ward off relegation fears for the moment. They will need at least four points from their next couple of games, provided there are no other upsets, to stay afloat.         
	Dempo, who are currently placed fourth in the standings (27 points from 19 matches), are not in the running for the title. As coach Armando Colaco put it, their focus is the AFC Cup, where they are top of group E with six points from two games. United coach Subrata Bhattacharya was excited at having managed to grab a point. Im very happy with the fighting quality shown by our players. This will prove to be a crucial point for us, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting: T20 is hard to judge
                                                   Ponting: T20 is hard to judge
                      
	Melbourne: Australia are not exactly the favourites at next months ICC World Twenty20 given their past record but skipper Ricky Ponting feels it is hard to predict a teams chances in a format, which is perhaps the most unpredictable of all.         
	Ponting believes his side would put up a better show in the second edition of the event starting June 5 in England.         
	I think the game is hard to judge if you try to get a form line even out of the IPL (Indian Premier League) There were all sorts of upsets throughout, Ponting said.         
	Ponting said his men have learnt their lessons from the last edition of the championship in South Africa.         
	We will be very well prepared for that, we have learnt a lot about the game in the last couple of years, he said. We were disappointed with the way we exited the tournament the last time around. You can expect a bold showing from Australia.           (PTI)

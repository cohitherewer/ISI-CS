                                                                                                                                   Agassi pleads 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Andre Agassi has pleaded for compassion from critics over his taking of crystal methamphetamine, saying he needed help to fight depression in 1997.         
	In a television interview regarding his admission of taking methamphetamine, Agassi became emotional when interviewer Katie Couric read him the words of Martina Navratilova, who compared Agassi to Roger Clemens, a star baseball pitcher who has denied wrongdoing despite links to performance-enhancing drugs.         
	Its what you dont want to hear, Agassi said.         
	I would hope with that would come some compassion that maybe this person doesnt need condemnation. Maybe this person could stand a little help.         
	Because that was at a time in my life when I needed help. I had a problem, and there might be many other athletes out there that test positive for recreational drugs that have a problem.         
	So I would ask for some compassion.

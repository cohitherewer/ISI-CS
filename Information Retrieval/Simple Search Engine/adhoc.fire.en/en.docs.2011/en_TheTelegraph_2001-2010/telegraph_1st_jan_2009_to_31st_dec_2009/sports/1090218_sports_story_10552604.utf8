	St Johns: Off-spinner Graeme Swann claimed two cheap wickets on Tuesday as England kept their grip on the third Test against the West Indies at lunch on the third day.               
	At 12am (IST) the West Indies were 220 for five with Ramnaresh Sarwan (67) and Brendon Nash (6) at the crease.               
	The home team, resuming on 55 for one, went to the break on 132 for three. Swann, playing his third Test, claimed two for 17 from 11 overs.         
	Devon Smith and nightwatchman Daren Powell extended their overnight stand to 64 in the first hour to stall the visitors. But two balls after the drinks break, Swann broke through with the key scalp of opener Smith.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Churchill Brothers receive a bye
                                                                                                                       7                                      Churchill Brothers receive a bye
                      
	Kuala Lumpur: I-League champions Churchill Brothers will face the winners of the match between Syrian side Al Karamah and Al Wahda in the playoff clash on February 6 to qualify for the prestigious AFC Champions League (ACL) 2010.         
	Churchill were lucky to get a bye in the three-team West Asian group as they will play only one match in the ACL play-offs. Al Karamah and Al Wahda will face off on January 30, according to the ACL draw announced here. The venues of the matches will be announced later.         
	Even if Churchill qualify for the 32-team ACL, they will be clubbed in Group B along with two-time champions and 2009 runners-up Al Ittihad of Saudi Arabia, Irans Zob Ahan and big-spending Bunyodkor of Uzbekistan. The group is virtually a group of death.         
	The winner of the East Asian group playoffs will be clubbed in Group G along with 2008 ACL champions Gamba Osaka of Japan, Henan Jianye of China and Korean FA Cup winners Suwon Bluewings

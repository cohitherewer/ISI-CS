	Mohun Bagan Thursday decided to send clippings and photos of Bhaichung Bhutia donning East Bengal jersey at practice Wednesday to arbitrator Amarendra Sharan. Sharan was appointed by the All India Football Federation to resolve Bhutias row with Bagan and is expected to give his verdict on Saturday.      
	Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra said: We will be sending the photos to Sharan as we feel that he has violated the contract by donning the East Bengal jersey. Sharan hadnt given him the permission to wear the East Bengal jersey. We protest this as he has a two-year contract with us. Mitra once again reminded that the club is determined to appeal to Fifa if they are not satisfied with Sharans verdict.          
	 East Bengals trouble with their foreign recruits seems to be a never ending affair. Brazilian striker Edmilson, expressing dissatisfaction over the way his contract was being terminated by the club, on Thursday threatened to move Fifa.       
	He also said that the club was not clearing his payments since his brawl with coach Subhas Bhowmick and teammate Saumik Dey.      
	According to sources, Edmilson refused to accept the release order from the club too if his demands were not met.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies have WI on the mat
                                                                                                                       7                                      Aussies have WI on the mat
                      
	Brisbane: The Australian pace battery had made a serious dent to the West Indies batting Friday.         
	The hosts declared at 480 for eight on the strength of 79 from Marcus North and an unbeaten half-century from Nathan Hauritz.         
	The declaration came half-an-hour before tea and, after an eventful afternoon, the limping visitors were five for 134 with Mitchell Johnson picking up two wickets as all four home pacers found success.         
	According to cricinfo, Chris Gayle exploded in the six overs ahead of the break as the Windies began in stunning fashion, but the visitors had soon lost four wickets as the hopes for a strong show began to disappear.         
	Gayle arrived in Brisbane from Jamaica the day before the game and accelerated like a plane on the runway as he blasted Ben Hilfenhaus for three early fours in front of point.         
	After the easy pace of the Australians, Gayle held the crowds interest and was such a worry for Ricky Ponting that he removed a third slip and put a man on the boundary instead.         
	The worry did not last long for Ponting as Gayle departed on 31 to an obvious lbw  he was hit on the back pad by Hilfenhaus but resisted by calling for an unnecessary review.         
	Travis Dowlin, who is playing his third Test, was at the crease on 40.         
	While North was careful in his 157-ball innings, Hauritz was happy to play his shots and peaked with a couple of pulls in an over from Bravo.         
	Hauritz, who was dropped on five, is appearing in his first game at the Gabba since he was a Queensland representative and his 50 not out gave him a boost on a ground that hasnt been friendly to his off-spin.

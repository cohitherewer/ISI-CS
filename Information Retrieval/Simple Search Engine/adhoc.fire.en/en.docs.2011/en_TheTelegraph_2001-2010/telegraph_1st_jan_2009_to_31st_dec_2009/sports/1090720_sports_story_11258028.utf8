The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Habibur set for August return
                                                     Habibur set for August return
            A STAFF REPORTER            Habibur                           
	Calcutta: Doctors have given permission to Mohun Bagans Habibur Rehman Mondal to start training from the second week of August, a source close to the player revealed Sunday.         
	However, the defender, who had been admitted in an intensive care unit last month for extreme dehydration, is yet to be contacted by the Bagan officials despite the commencement of training for the coming season, the source added.         
	The clubs pre-season training camp may be held at Kalyani instead of Kalimpong at the end of this month.         
	Meanwhile, peeved with the clubs behaviour towards its players recently, former Bagan players may boycott Mohun Bagan Day.

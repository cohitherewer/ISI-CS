The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SRK wont look to cut costs
                                                   SRK wont look to cut costs
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders principal owner, Shah Rukh Khan, wont exactly be looking to cut costs when a call is taken on the number of players who should head either to England or South Africa in his teams colours.         
	At the time of writing, Monday evening, England appeared the more favoured venue for edition No.2 of the Indian Premier League (IPL), which begins on April 10. But, then, Cricket South Africa is more than just keen to play host and the IPL chairman, Lalit Modi, is heading there first for discussions.         
	So         
	Shah Rukh is clear in his mind that any decision must be driven by the tactical requirements of the team and not by a need to prune expenses only because the (T20) tournament will be held overseas this year, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	So far, the arrangement has been such that the franchises foot their travel and accommodation costs, usually for a squad of 14 players and six-eight members of the support staff, but the 2008 model could well be amended.         
	Circumstances, after all, have changed. Its one thing to travel internally, quite another to set up shop overseas. That too for six weeks.         
	However, till theres a review, the Knight Riders and the seven other franchises have to continue budgeting for those expenses.         
	Interestingly, the source added that the Knight Riders may travel with a couple of more players, possibly a total of around 18, if the edition is held in South Africa. Reason: The costs wont be that high there.         
	Given that conditions both in England (early part of summer) and South Africa (onset of winter) would be challenging for the batsmen, its likely that the most experienced and technically accomplished alone are going to make the cut.         
	To talk specifically of the Knight Riders, somebody like Aakash Chopra would be a near-certainty. He wouldnt, of course, have been seriously considered had IPL 2009 been held in India.         
	Actually, the source was quick to point out that the Knight Riders wouldnt be losing sleep.         
	Our squad is largely made up of international batsmen and domestic bowlers, so to say The batsmen have the experience and the seam bowlers in particular, whatever the level of their exposure, would find the conditions (in England/South Africa) helpful... So, were fine, unlike perhaps some of the other franchises...         
	For the record, the Knight Riders have already announced an initial squad of 28, excluding Ricky Ponting and Umar Gul, for the second edition.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Not game for Tests only, says Mahela
                                                   Not game for Tests only, says Mahela
                      
	Colombo: Outgoing Sri Lankan skipper Mahela Jayawardene on Thursday confirmed The Telegraph report that the selectors idea to have two captains influenced his decision to relinquish the post after the Pakistan tour.         
	They tried to persuade me to split the captaincy and continue leading in Tests and all that. But I felt, as a captain, it was easier to have both the captaincies because it gives you the extra bit of time to control things. And I believe the next captain should have the same thing. It is much easier to hold on to everything.         
	Because he can put his imprint and do what he wants. It is tough for two different captains to do two different things because there will be certain players coming in and going out, Jayawardene told reporters a day after announcing his decision to step down from captaincy after the Pakistan series.         
	He said his poor form in the recent ODI series against India also prompted him to take the decision.         
	My one-day batting has gone down a bit and I need to focus on it. I cant afford to let go my reputation as a ODI batsman just like that, Jayawardene said.         
	The elegant right-hander has been going through a rough patch of late, scoring only one 50 in last 17 ODIs.         
	Jayawardene said he believed it was the right time to hand over the mantle to his successor keeping in mind the 2011 World Cup.         
	My successor needs time to settle down, put his imprint on the team and have his vision. What he wants for the 2011 World Cup. To do that he needs adequate time, he said. My contribution should also be with the bat. That is my responsibility. Not getting the runs obviously contributed to making the decision.         
	Jayawardene said his decision to resign was not taken under any pressure. No, it had nothing to do with the selectors.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Maiden century by Duminy
                                                                                                                                   Maiden century by Duminy
                      
	Centurion: J. P. Duminy scored a maiden one-day century as South Africa soared to 331 for five off 50 overs after being put into bat by Zimbabwe at SuperSport Park on Tuesday.         
	The 25-year-old finished unbeaten on 111. His score included nine fours and two sixes as South Africa bettered the 295 runs scored in a 45-run victory against their neighbours in Benoni two days ago.           (PTI)

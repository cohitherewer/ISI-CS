            A CORRESPONDENT                            
	Auckland: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni blamed poor shot selection and the failure to read the Eden Park wicket as the possible reasons for Indias defeat in the final ODI against New Zealand on Saturday.               
	The following are excerpts               
	What went wrong?         
	We misread the wicket. That is what I can say. We do make mistakes but we should have negotiated the initial period when it was doing quite a bit. It was an ideal start given by Gautam (Gambhir) and (Virender) Sehwag but we failed to capitalise. We played shots that didnt really come off very well in this game. Throughout the series we have played big shots which were paying us but this time we lost a few wickets and we put ourselves under pressure.         
	Were the Indians fully focussed?         
	We were giving our 100 per cent but as I said, we have a side that play a few shots. A couple of good deliveries and they got a few wickets. After that we lost more wickets and suddenly we put ourselves under pressure. We tried to win but we didnt.         
	Couldnt you have rested some of the players Saturday?         
	We wanted to give the bowlers who will bowl in the Test matches more time in the middle. But you can get a flat track and at the same time you will have to bowl a good line and length. Most of them were very keen to play.         
	Why were the reserves not given an opportunity to play?         
	You want them to bowl more and thats how they will get the rhythm and know which areas to bowl, whether they are a fraction too short or too full. Thats why I gave Ishant may be a couple of more overs.         
	Sending Raina at No. 3         
	It gets very difficult for the guys who are not regular members and dont start in the first eleven. The six or seven at the best can get 30 or 40 odd runs. But if he bats up he gets the opportunity to score 50, or may be a 100. So you give him the opportunity to where he has good chances of performing.         
	Where will he rate this series win?         
	I dont believe in rating because every series is important for an international player. Especially, the kind of side this is, each and every series is important for us whether we are playing at home or we are playing the toughest team in the world. We rate all the games equally and try to enjoy each and every game and at the same time give our 100 per cent.         
	Wasnt the win in New Zealand special?         
	Of course its something special. But that doesnt mean the things we have achieved in the past are really not in consideration. We had not won a series in New Zealand thats for sure. But if you look behind, there might have been a series where there were more struggles or where players have put in more effort in winning the series.         
	Is Saturdays loss going to have an effect on the Test series?         
	In the one-day series before the start we had lost two Twenty20 games and the same question was asked. Its not about what we have done. We have to start from scratch again. Nothing changes. You have to start from scratch and you have to perform at your best. Particularly when it comes to Test cricket you have to play consistent cricket over a period of time. Its not winning one session or two sessions, you have to win more sessions than the opposition in a comprehensive way.         
	Ishants spat with Jesse Ryder         
	Heat of the moment it seems. But I believe they have sorted it out. Its an ugly thing to happen on the field. But it happens. It happens to fast bowlers when they get hammered and get hit for sixes that go beyond 70 yards.         
	If the series victory was an easy one         
	We should give credit to those players, you shouldnt say its an easy win and things like that. In the same way, this game New Zealand won, so we shouldnt be saying we were complacent or we werent giving our 100 per cent. They outplayed us.         
	The differences from the last tour         
	Theres plenty. Maybe the wickets were not the same that were given in 2003, but still the conditions are very different. The wind is a factor, the dimensions of the ground, its quite cold out here at the same time. They are very different to what we are used to playing in the subcontinent or wherever we have played. It was a good learning lesson for us.         
	On catches being dropped regularly         
	I think both the sides have consistently dropped catches. Its not fine, its definitely a worrying thing because you dont want to drop catches but thats part and parcel of cricket.         
	Ryders form with the bat         
	Personally you want to treat each and every batsman as a threat. It can be from the top order, it can be from the lower order. Each and every batsman is important. Definitely hes in good nick, hes batted well, and we will look to get him out with the new ball. And that will definitely make it easier for us, but its not just about making plans, I feel its more about execution. It depends on the bowlers and the fielders at the same time.         
	How will the batting be in the Test series?         
	If you see the one-day series so far, its been quite flamboyant. Batsmen, who spent considerable time in the middle, were playing big shots. But you have to calm yourself when it comes to Test matches because the red ball does a bit more.         
	On Indias third seamer         
	Test cricket is different because the ball thats used is different and at the same time the field restrictions and all these things they matter. Its quite difficult to say our third seamer didnt perform in the one-dayers, so well struggle with the third seamer in the Tests also. You have to see how everybody is bowling. We have a battery of fast bowlers. So lets see whos bowling well at the nets.

                                                     Test of loyalty for England players
            NICK HOULT            Kevin Pietersen                           
	England fly to the West Indies on Wednesday with more turmoil surrounding the team after it emerged that senior players are facing the prospect of having to choose between loyalty to their country or a lucrative Indian Premier League deal.         
	The latest battle of brinkmanship between the England amp; Wales Cricket Board and the IPL reached a new level on Saturday when Lalit Modi, the commissioner of the IPL, raised the stakes by saying the players must be available for four weeks.         
	The ECB had thought they had reached an agreement with Modi that Englands centrally contracted cricketers could appear in the league for just 15 days.         
	But Modi has confirmed that they must be available for four weeks of each year of the two-year IPL deals on offer or they will not be entered into the auction on February 6. Earlier this week six England players were hopeful of being put into that auction.         
	This development is a serious concern, said Sean Morris, chief executive of the Professional Cricketers Association. We are working through this with the ECB but clearly it is a concern to India and has a potential impact on English cricket. If we are the only country to have players not appearing in the IPL then that would not be a good prospect.         
	Morris is currently locked in talks with the ECB over the new central contracts which remain unsigned despite nearly six months of negotiations. The ECB wants to protect its May Test series, which clashes with the IPL, while the players are desperate to cash in on the IPL.         
	An ECB spokesman said: We have had some very good talks with the BCCI and they were very comfortable with our proposal over a wide range of issues.         
	If the ECB allows the players to go to the IPL for a month then they would miss the first Test against the West Indies, which is due to begin at Lords on May 6.         
	The IPL is provisionally set to begin on April 10 with the final on May 29.

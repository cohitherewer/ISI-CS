                                                   Sachin sits out with bad stomach
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Johannesburg: Food poisoning kept senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkar out of the West Indies match here on Wednesday.         
	Sachin started feeling a bit unwell from yesterday (Tuesday) afternoon itself... I dont know what triggered it, though, manager Anurag Thakur told The Telegraph.         
	Given Sachins fondness for seafood, its being assumed that prawns did the damage.         
	Sachins non-availability gave Abhishek Nayar his third ODI cap. This time, the all-rounder actually got to do something.

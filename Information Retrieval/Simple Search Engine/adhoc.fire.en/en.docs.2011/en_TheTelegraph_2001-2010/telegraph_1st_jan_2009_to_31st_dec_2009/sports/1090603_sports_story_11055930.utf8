The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Subrata signs for Pune FC
                                                   Subrata signs for Pune FC
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India goalkeeper Subrata Paul Tuesday signed a one-year contract with Pune FC in Mumbai. Paul was off-loaded by East Bengal at the end of the season.         
	Loss of form and confidence had taken a toll on this young goalkeeper and Paul was looking for a club that would be far from the madding Calcutta cauldron.         
	And with Derrick Pereira at the helm, Paul did not think twice before signing for this newly-promoted I-League side. He is a class goalkeeper. No doubt about that. Last season was not good for him but that happens to every footballer. I am sure he will be his old self with us, Pereira said from Mumbai.         
	Perreira said that Pauls loss of form has nothing to do with his mental state of mind. I dont believe he has lost belief in himself, Pereira said.         
	Pereira said that Paul will join the team after the Nehru Cup. We have no issues. We want him for the I-League and the Federation Cup, he said.         
	Paul, who was the vital cog in national coach Bob Houghtons wheel during Indias triumphant Nehru Cup campaign in 2007, failed to recreate his performance in 2008.         
	He was in fact the highest paid goalkeeper (Rs 33 lakh approx) last season. But constant change of coaches at East Bengal, coupled with his favourite goalkeeping coach Debashish Mukherjees sacking, affected his morale.         
	Paul took some days off after Subhas Bhowmick returned to the helm and was at the receiving end of the fans ire after letting in a soft goal during an I-League match in Barasat.         
	That was the last straw and he decided enough is enough, a close friend of Pauls, who was with East Bengal last season said.

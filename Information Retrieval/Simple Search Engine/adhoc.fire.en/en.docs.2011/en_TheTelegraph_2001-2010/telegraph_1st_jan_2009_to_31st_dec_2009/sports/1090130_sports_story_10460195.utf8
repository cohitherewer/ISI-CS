	Melbourne: Serena Williams earned a shot at her 10th Grand Slam title and Dinara Safina moved one win away from her first with semi-final victories at the Australian Open.         
	Williams, who won the Australian title in 2003, 2005 and 2007, played her best match of the tournament in a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Olympic champion Elena Dementieva on Thursday.         
	I havent moved like that for a while, so I was a little shocked, said Williams, still leaving room for improvement. A perfect match for me? Oh, no, no, no. But it was definitely better.         
	Shell get her chance to extend the alternate-year sequence of titles when she meets third-seeded Safina, who beat fellow Russian Vera Zvonareva 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) in the other semi-final.         
	The winner of Saturday nights final will also replace Serbias Jelena Jankovic at the top of the rankings.         
	I think we will shake hands after the match and say You deserve to be No. 1, Safina said.         
	Safinas older brother, Marat Safin, won the title here in 2005, the day after Williams had won the womens final.         
	Safin also held the No. 1 ranking in November 2000, meaning Safina has the chance to write the Russian siblings into history.         
	Since I was growing up it was my dream to be No. 1, she said. I watched my brother winning this tournament. Its great that I can follow his steps.         
	Safina recovered a break early in the second set but again was in trouble with Zvonareva serving for the second set after breaking to pull ahead 6-5.         
	But Safina broke back at love to force a tiebreaker and, from 4-4, ran off the last three points.         
	Safina is yet to win a major, losing the 2008 French Open final to Ana Ivanovic in her best previous run. She lost to Williams in last years US Open semi-finals.         
	The roof was closed at Rod Laver Arena for both womens semi-finals, protecting the players and fans from outside temperatures topping 44C degrees.         
	Williams commended tournament organisers for deciding early to close the roof rather than wait, as they had Wednesday, until after the first set of her quarter final against Svetlana Kuznetsova.         
	It was really, really hot today, she said, and, uhm, it was really hot.         
	News updates during the semi-finals reported it was the hottest January day since 1939 in Melbourne. The temperature hit 44.3C at one point.         
	It was almost as hot Wednesday when Williams was only a game from a quarter final exit, having to break Kuznetsova when the Russian was serving for the match.         
	Twice before, Williams has had to save match points in her semi-finals en route to the Australian title.         
	But the reigning US Open champion found her rhythm quickly against Dementieva, who has not gone past the semi-finals at a Grand Slam since 2004.         
	I just really wasnt playing well at all. I just wasnt bringing it, she said of her first five matches here. I thought that I was just going to have to do whatever it takes to win.         
	This is definitely not over. I have to play a really tough opponent who wants to win... it (could) be their first Grand Slam. Thats super exciting.         
	Williams ended Dementievas best bid in four years for a major.         
	The Russian was on a 15-match winning streak, including two titles and wins over Williams and Safina at the Sydney International.         
	I had a good run... (but) I feel like today I was not quick enough, Dementieva said. I was not maybe aggressive enough against her. She dictated points.         
	But I have no regrets. I had just a great time here.         
	Williams got the only break of the first set in the eighth game and was in control of the match.         
	But Dementieva held to start the second set in a game that went to deuce five times and lasted 14 minutes, then broke Williams en route to a 3-0 lead.         
	That sparked a four-game run for Williams until Dementieva broke to even the second set at 4-4.         
	Then nerves seemed to get the best of Dementieva. Having problems with her service toss, she double-faulted twice, the second setting up break point. Williams ripped a backhand winner down the line and pumped her fist. She was helped by eight double-faults from Dementieva.         
	Williams has had problems with her first serve throughout the tournament, but it came through when she needed it most.         
	Serving for the match at 5-4, she started with an ace and hit another serve that Dementieva sent long.         
	At 30-15, Williams followed with another ace. Dementieva squealed and bent over in frustration. Another powerful serve on match point set up an easy overhead and it was over in 98 minutes.

                                                   CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	 No Indian in ICC T20 mens squad
    London: No Indian cricketer made it to the International Cricket Councils special team of the World Twenty20 for men announced on Monday. The ICC special womens team, however, included Indian pacer Rumeli Dhar in it.         
	The Teams         
	Men: Chris Gayle (West Indies), Tillekaratne Dilshan (Sri Lanka), Jacques Kallis, (South Africa), AB de Villiers (South Africa), Younis Khan (Pakistan, captain), Dwayne Bravo (West Indies), Shahid Afridi (Pakistan), Kamran Akmal (Pakistan, wicketkeeper), Wayne Parnell (South Africa), Umar Gul (Pakistan), Ajantha Mendis (Sri Lanka); 12th man: Lasith Malinga (Sri Lanka)

	 Amarnath ire
    New Delhi: Mohinder Amarnath feels that irrational scheduling of the Indian Premier League (IPL) was a major factor for Indias debacle in the World Twenty20 and also questioned the purpose of Indias short tour to the West Indies. Half of the team was not fit in the World Cup, so how can you expect them to win? It was not IPL, it was international cricket. Playing for the country is of utmost importance, so, better planning would have helped in avoiding those injuries, Amarnath said.               
	 Lloyd view
    London: Former West Indies captain Clive Lloyd has described Tillekaratne Dilshan as a worthy winner of the Player of the Tournament Award in the just-concluded World Twenty20.               
	 Manager fear
    Hyderabad: V. Chamundeshwaranath, manager of Team India for World T20 in England, has sought police protection fearing threat to his life from a group of persons associated with the Andhra Cricket Association.               
	 Vaughan out
    London: Former captain Michael Vaughan was left out of Englands 16-member Ashes training camp squad on Monday. Fast bowler Stephen Harmison, who also played in the 2005 series, was likewise omitted from the squad.         
	The Training squad         
	Andrew Strauss (captain), Matt Prior (wicketkeeper), James Anderson, Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Tim Bresnan, Stuart Broad, Paul Collingwood, Alastair Cook, Andrew Flintoff, Graham Onions, Monty Panesar, Kevin Pietersen, Adil Rashid, Ryan Sidebottom, Graeme Swann.               
	 Venue issue
    Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is not happy with the BCCI as Board president Shashank Manohar did not cooperate with Pakistan in its bid to retain the hosting rights of the 2011 World Cup. Initially when (Ejaz) Butt met ICC president David Morgan and vice-president Sharad Pawar in London, the latter had assured him things would be resolved, the source added. Meanwhile, Sri Lankan cricket committee chairman, Somachandra de Silva, has also said: We also dont agree to Pakistans proposal of them hosting their share of matches at neutral venues.

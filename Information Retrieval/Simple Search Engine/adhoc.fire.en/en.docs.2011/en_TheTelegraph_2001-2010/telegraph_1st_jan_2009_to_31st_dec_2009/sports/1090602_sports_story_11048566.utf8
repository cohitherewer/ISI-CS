The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Windies hope to regroup for Cup
                                                   Windies hope to regroup for Cup
                            
	London: The West Indies vice captain Denesh Ramdin said his team could win the Twenty20 World Cup despite the recent Test and one-day series losses to England.         
	For the West Indies to win, however, a drastic improvement will be needed after the series losses to England in May. Then there was the West Indies captain Chris Gayle suggesting he wouldnt be sorry if Test cricket died.         
	Hopefully, if the guys come together and play well, play some great cricket, I cant see why the West Indies cant win this trophy, Ramdin said. We have a good team with the likes of Chris Gayle, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, along with the young players coming through  Kieron Pollard, Darren Sammy  and Dwayne Bravo returning to the side.         
	Gayles batting during the Test series suggested he was already in Twenty20 mode  he came out, swatted a few boundaries and departed a few minutes later.         
	Gayle conceded the ODI series was not ideal preparation for the Twenty20 World Cup, which starts Friday at Lords.         
	The way we went about it wasnt the best, he said.         
	I am very disappointed with the series result but, at the same time, we just have to try and rebuild again to get back to the Twenty20.         
	The West Indies have been drawn in the toughest of four groups, playing against Australia and Sri Lanka. Ramdin believes the unpredictability of Twenty20 could work in West Indies favour.         
	Anything can happen on any given day, its anyones game, he said.         
	Everyone says its a batters game but, at the end of the day, the bowlers need to come on and get wickets for you. Taking a couple of wickets means the bowler has done his job, and now a batter can go out there hit a couple of sixes and win a game for you.         
	A brilliant catch by a fielder can also win a game for you.           (AP)

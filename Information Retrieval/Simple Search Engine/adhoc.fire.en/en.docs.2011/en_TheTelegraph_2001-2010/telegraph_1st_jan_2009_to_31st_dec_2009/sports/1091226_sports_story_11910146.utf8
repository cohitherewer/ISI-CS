	New Delhi: After Oliver Kahn and Diego Maradona, another soccer legend Lothar Matthaeus may visit Calcutta next month.         
	According to highly placed sources, the 48-year-old former star, who led West Germany to a memorable triumph in the 1990 World Cup final over Maradonas Argentina, may accompany the World Cup trophy that would be brought to Calcutta in January.         
	If everything goes right, Matthaeus would arrive in Calcutta from Atlanta on the night of January 14 along with the World Cup, said the source. He should be in the city for the next three days and attend different functions to be organised by Coca Cola, one of the Cup sponsors.         
	The company officials, when contacted, were tight-lipped and were in no position on comment on this at the moment.         
	Matthaeus, who was equally proficient as a midfielder and sweeper, is Germanys most capped player with 150 appearances. While Pele chose him in his list of 125 of the greatest living footballers, Maradona called Matthaeus his best rival on the field. He (Matthaeus) is the best rival I have ever had. I guess thats enough to define him, said Maradona .         
	Sources said the talk with Matthaeuss agent to bring the legendary footballer to Calcutta was at a final stage at the moment. An extremely fruitful discussion has been held and there is a positive chance of him coming to the eastern metropolis with the World Cup.         
	Though Matthaeus programme is yet to be finalised, the German star, the first to receive the Fifa Player of the Year award in 1991, has made it clear that he wont take part in any exhibition match.         
	Sources revealed Matthaeus would attend a function to be held at the Salt Lake Stadium. While top dignitaries would be invited for the function, players, football enthusiasts and school children may also get an opportunity to be photographed with Matthaeus and the original World Cup.         
	Matthaeus may also attend an evening of music and entertainment where the World Cup trophy will be kept for public display.

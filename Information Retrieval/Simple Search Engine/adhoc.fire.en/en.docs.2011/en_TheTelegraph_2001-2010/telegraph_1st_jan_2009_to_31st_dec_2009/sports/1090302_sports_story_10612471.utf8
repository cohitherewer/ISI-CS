                                                   Miandad:Sunny, Viv my favourites 
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Karachi: Former Pakistan skipper Javed Miandad on Sunday listed Indias Sunil Gavaskar and the West Indian Vivian Richards as his all-time favourite players.         
	I admired lot of players but I loved watching Viv and Gavaskar. They are my favourite players, Miandad said.         
	Pakistan batting heroes Hanif Mohammed and Miandad became the latest players to be inducted formally into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame, in Lahore, on Sunday.         
	The duo received their commemorative caps from Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman and International Cricket Council (ICC) director Ejaz Butt.         
	Together with Pakistans World Cup-winning captain Imran Khan, Hanif and Miandad form the Pakistani contingent in the initial intake of 55 players into the Hall of Fame.         
	Attending the ceremony at Gaddafi stadium, Miandad, who resigned as director general cricket after differences with Pakistan Cricket Board, listed his innings at Sharjah against India as the best of his life.         
	That innings changed a lot for us and after that we got confident and started winning matches regularly. It is a big honour for me just to have played for my country, said Miandad, who played 124 Test and 238 ODIs.         
	Hanif said he was very proud to be nominated in the Hall of Fame.         
	Im very grateful to be honoured and also surprised because my name is with so many great cricketers of the world.         
	I dont think I deserve this honour but Im grateful for being selected to receive it.         
	I am very proud, I think it is a great honour because I have played against some of the players in the hall and they were truly great. Sir Gary Sobers was my all-time favourite, said Hanif, who represented Pakistan in 55 Tests scoring 3915 runs.         
	However, Pakistans most successful captain Imran Khan was not present at the ceremony held at the tea break of the second Test against Sri Lanka.         
	He couldnt attend because of his political commitments, one board official said.

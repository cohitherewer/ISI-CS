                                                   ICC confirms SA as hosts
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) board Monday unanimously agreed upon South Africa as the host for this years Champions Trophy.         
	Meeting via teleconference to discuss a recommendation made by the ICC chief executives committee last week, the hosting rights was awarded to Cricket South Africa following doubts expressed over the wisdom of having the tournament in Sri Lanka in end September-early October given the possibility of adverse weather conditions.         
	The duration of the competition is an already curtailed 12 days, leaving no room for reserve days. Thus to minimise risk and create certainty around the event it had been recommended that CSA be sought as alternative hosts.         
	The eight-team event was originally scheduled to take place in Pakistan but was postponed last year and then moved out due to security concerns.         
	The Wanderers stadium in Johannesburg and Centurion in Pretoria were identified as preferred venues subject to conclusion of satisfactory commercial terms, an ICC release said.         
	I think the board has made a sensible decision that will give the event every chance of success, the ICC president David Morgan said.         
	I would like to thank Sri Lanka Cricket for its commitment to offer an alternative to Pakistan. And also, I want to acknowledge its willingness to step aside in this matter.         
	The ICC Board also confirmed the dates for next years World Twenty20 in the West Indies from April 30 to May 16. Matches will be staged in St Lucia, Barbados and St Kitts, which will simultaneously stage the womens tournament.

                  Dwayne Bravo scored an unbeaten 58                     
	Hyderabad: Dwayne Bravo struck form with a bludgeoning 34-ball 58 as Trinidad and Tobago stretched their unbeaten run to the final of the Champions League, thrashing Cape Cobras by seven wickets in the second semi-final Thursday.         
	Chasing a stiff 176 to set up final with NSW Blues, Bravo and skipper Daren Ganga (44) produced a match-winning unbeaten 93-run stand for the third wicket and overhauled the target with four balls to spare at Rajiv Gandhi stadium.         
	Riding on fantastic knocks of JP Duminy (62 not out) and Herschelle Gibbs (42), Cape Cobras put up a competitive 175 for five in 20 overs, after opting to bat.         
	The match was evenly balanced as the Caribbean had lost three wickets at the half-way mark but Bravo and Ganga batted fearlessly and took the match away from the South Africans, who were let down by some poor fielding. Bravos hit four fours and three sixes while Daren Gangas unbeaten knock was studded with one four and two sixes.         
	Earlier, Duminy showed patience when his partners were changing quickly from the other end and cut loose towards the end to shape the innings of his side.         
	The 40-ball knock of the left-hander was adorned with four fours and three sixes.

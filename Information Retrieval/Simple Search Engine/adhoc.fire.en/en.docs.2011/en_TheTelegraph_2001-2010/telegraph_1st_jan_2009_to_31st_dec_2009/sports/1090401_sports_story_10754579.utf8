	I am a right-handed batsman. Whenever I try to flick inswinging deliveries, I end up getting clean bowled. Please help.              
	(Swapnil Ghose, 14, Calcutta-37)              
	You are playing away from the body. Also try and get your front foot in line of the ball.              
	I am a mediumpacer. Despite my best efforts and coachs advice, I am unable to keep the seam straight/upright. Please help.              
	(Ayan Mukherjee, 16, Calcutta-46)              
	Keep working on your wrist action.              
	I am a left-arm pacer. I fail to bowl the inswinger. Please help.              
	(Soumyajit Mitra, 14, Calcutta-60)              
	Work on your shoulder position at the time of delivery. A side-on action will help.              
	I am a mediumpacer and have problems with my run-up. I tend not to generate enough pace from my run-up. Please help.              
	(Tapan Guha, 19, Calcutta-10)              
	Work on a run-up that allows you to be balanced at the time of delivery. Also work up good acceleration through the run-up.              
	Are there any advantages of practising on matting wickets?              
	(Suman Saha, 23, Durgapur)              
	It does help your back-foot game and for shots like the pull and cut.              
	I am a right-handed batsman. I have noticed that of late I have been clean bowled the maximum number of times. This is also happening within a few deliveries after coming to the crease. Please help.              
	(Sampat Paul, 19, Calcutta-42)              
	You are obviously forgetting the basics. You must try and get behind the line of the ball.              
	I am a mediumpacer. When the batsman is in a murderous mood, what should be the ideal length to bowl at him?              
	(Sushil Dutta, 18, Madhyamgram)              
	The important thing here is to bowl a good line and bowling to your field.              
	How can one improve reflexes for close-in catching?              
	(Sangad Chanda, 21, Calcutta-56)              
	Regular practice and plenty of fitness work and stretching.              
	While attempting the cut, I try to keep the ball down but often end up giving a catch to gully. Please help.              
	(Amit Konar, 17, Calcutta)              
	Keep your head down at the time of contact. Also transfer your weight into the shot.              
	What is the secret of batting well under pressure?              
	(Soham Nath, 22, Calcutta-19)              
	Set small targets at a time. Keep things simple and above all you must lay a huge emphasis on shot selection like Gautam Gambhir did to save the Napier Test for India.

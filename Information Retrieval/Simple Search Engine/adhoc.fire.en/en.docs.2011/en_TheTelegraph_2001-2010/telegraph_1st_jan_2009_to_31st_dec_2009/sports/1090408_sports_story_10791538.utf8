                                                   PCB to follow ICC advice
                      
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Tuesday said it would not field players who break away from the Indian Cricket League (ICL) in the T20 World Cup were the International Cricket Council (ICC) to rule against such a move.         
	A few ICL players were named in Pakistans list of probables that is to be pruned down to 15 next month.         
	The PCB chief operating officer Saleem Altaf said that the board has asked ICL executive board chairman Kapil Dev to clarify whether the league still had contracts with the Pakistan players.         
	We have asked the ICL to let us know if they have suspended contracts of the Pakistan players temporarily or whether they have cancelled them altogether. Because unless we have documentary evidence that the players have been released by ICL they wouldnt be considered for Pakistan selection, Altaf stated.         
	ICL players Abdul Razzaq, Rana Naved and Imran Nazir are among the 30 probables.           (PTI)

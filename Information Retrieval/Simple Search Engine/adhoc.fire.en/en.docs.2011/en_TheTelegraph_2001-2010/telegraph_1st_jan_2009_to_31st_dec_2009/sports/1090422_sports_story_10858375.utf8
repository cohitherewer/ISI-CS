The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rain hits tie
                                                   Rain hits tie
                                  
	Durban: Rajasthan Royals and Mumbai Indians split points after their Indian Premier League match was called off due to persistent rain at Kingsmead ground here on Tuesday.         
	Not even a single ball could be played due to steady drizzle. The rain was intermittent all evening and the umpires decided to call it off two and a half hours after the scheduled start.         
	Earlier, the opening match of the day, between the Kolkata Knight Riders and the Kings XI Punjab, was decided on Duckworth-Lewis, hardly ten overs into the chase.         
	The Mumbai team, after gaining one point from the washed out tie, have moved to the top of the table with three points in their kitty.         
	The Sachin Tendulkar-led side had defeated last years runners-up Chennai Super Kings in their opening match on Saturday.         
	Defending champions Rajasthan, who began their campaign with a crushing defeat at the hands of Royal Challenger Bangalore, opened their account and stand at number seven in the table.

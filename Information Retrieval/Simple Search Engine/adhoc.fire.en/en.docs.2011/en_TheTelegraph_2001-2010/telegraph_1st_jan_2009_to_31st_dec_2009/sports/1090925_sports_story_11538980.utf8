The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | X factor can worry Piquet
                                                     X factor can worry Piquet
            TOM CARY            Nelson Piquet Jr                           
	Who is Witness X? As the Formula One circus landed in Singapore on Wednesday, switched on their BlackBerrys and stepped out into the 31 degree Celsius heat, it was the question on everyones lips.         
	Surely someone senior within the organisation who would have sufficient security clearance to be party to such discussions? suggested one hack. Maybe even their star driver, Fernando Alonso? said another. Did you notice that in the audio transcript, the FIA lawyer Paul Harris slipped up and referred to Witness X as Witness A at one point?!         
	Whoever it is, the sudden emergence of a whistleblower within Renault who knew of Renaults plan to crash deliberately at last years Singapore Grand Prix does not bode well for one man: Nelson Piquet Jr.         
	While Witness X was mainly useful to the governing body in corroborating Piquet Jrs assertion that Renaults former team principal, Flavio Briatore, knew of the plan to bring out a safety car  and was thus instrumental in the FIA handing the Italian a lifetime ban from motorsport  his or her testimony also sheds intriguing new light on who first raised the idea of the crash.         
	Piquet Jr, who was fired by Renault earlier this summer, has always asserted that the first he knew of the plan to crash was on the Sunday morning of the race, when he was told to do so by Briatore and his executive director of engineering, Pat Symonds, who was also given a five-year ban from the sport on Monday.         
	Symonds, by contrast, has always alleged that it was Piquet Jr who first approached him with the idea. He said as much to FIA investigators when first questioned on the subject in Spa last month, and repeated that assertion in a heartfelt letter to the FIA, which was included in the 91 pages of evidence published on Tuesday.         
	The idea for this incident was entirely conceived by Nelson Piquet Jr, Symonds stated. At the time I naively believed that it was something he wanted to do for the good of the team. I was not aware of the position of his contract negotiations although with the benefit of hindsight I now consider that he believed that his actions would have a favourable effect on these negotiations.         
	In Renaults own evidence, submitted by its lawyer, Ali Malek QC, it says that Witness X made the following allegations: a) Nelson Piquet Jr had approached Pat Symonds after qualifying (Saturday, Sept 27) and suggested the idea of a deliberate crash to atone for his poor performance in qualifying; b) Symonds mentioned the idea to Briatore.         
	It is understood that Witness X heard of Piquet Jrs suggestion only second-hand from Symonds. But why would Symonds lie that evening? Unless he is far more calculating than most in the paddock give him credit for and was already covering his tracks?         
	The FIA appears happy to believe Piquet Jrs version. But then it granted the Brazilian immunity from prosecution so it would not be in its interests now to reopen the issue.

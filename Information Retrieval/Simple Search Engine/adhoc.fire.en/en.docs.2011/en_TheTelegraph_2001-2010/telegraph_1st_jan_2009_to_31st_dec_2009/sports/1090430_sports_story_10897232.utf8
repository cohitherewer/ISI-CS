    - KP ends campaign with win           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Morne van Wyk en route to his unbeaten 43 during Kolkata Knight Riders match against Royal Challengers Bangalore in Durban on Wednesday. (AFP)                                 
	Durban: The Kolkata Knight Riders did make a difference, on Wednesday. Not to their fortunes, but the IPL 2009 points table. Instead of being second last, the Knights are now at rock-bottom.         
	Purely technically, the Knights remain in contention for honours, but nobody would be willing to bet even one Rand on them.         
	John Buchanan may argue that the latest defeat (by five wickets), at the hands of the Royal Challengers Bangalore, came on the penultimate ball, but Kevin Pietersens team made it close by almost losing the plot.         
	No credit, then, to the Knights.         
	Kingsmead was once Pietersens home ground, till politics made him go through the qualification process for England, and he was delighted at ending his campaign on a winning note. On once familiar turf too.         
	Indeed, owing to national duty commitments, this edition of the IPL is over for Pietersen, a former England captain.         
	Its great to leave on a winning note, though I wouldve loved to have won more... This win should give the team a bit of a kick-start and a bit of momentum... The company I had for the past few weeks was fantastic and I enjoyed keeping the boys happy and getting them to smile, he said.         
	Brendon McCullum, the Knights captain, had a sullen look. Of course, with good reasons.         
	McCullums own confidence has gone for a toss, but he hasnt lost faith in his team. Not publicly, at least.         
	Wed presented ourselves opportunities, but arent out of the tournament... I still believe we can make the semi-finals, but it will require a special effort... Weve got to go forward believing we could get there... Just one person may change things... One special effort, McCullum pointed out.         
	Having failed yet again, out first ball to Pietersen, who started with his off-spin, McCullum was asked (once more) whether captaincy was burdening him. He parroted much the same lines.         
	Ive got my heart and soul in the job... Its not for want of trying... At times, however, it can get quite lonely... I need to first bat for a few overs... I accept its difficult to preach if one isnt getting runs... Ill be talking about the things well be able to control.         
	McCullum, who didnt keep, was spot-on when he remarked that both teams had been under pressure. Clearly, the No.1 reason why the match wasnt of a high quality.         
	The Knights, incidentally, were outsmarted from the beginning  taken aback by Pietersens decision to open with a double spin attack (with left-armer Roelof van der Merwe at the other end).         
	It was a good move, McCullum, whod won the toss, conceded.         
	The Knights effected four changes, which included dropping Ajantha Mendis and giving keeper Morne van Wyk his first match. The latter top-scored, 43 not out, but one does wonder whether omitting Mendis was sensible.         
	Wriddhiman Saha played his first match, as a batsman, and was good while he lasted. The team management was worried he might have jarred his left thumb (operated upon earlier this month) in catching Pietersen, but was reported to be fine.         
	Anureet Singh, meanwhile, will take some time to recover from the muscle pull suffered on Monday. He wont be in the reckoning for the next match (against the Mumbai Indians, in East London, on Friday), a member of the team management told The Telegraph.         
	Sourav Sarkar, Anureets cover, has arrived from Calcutta.

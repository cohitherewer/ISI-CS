The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC concession for West Indies
                                                     ICC concession for West Indies

	New Delhi: The West Indies will be given until the last possible moment to make changes to their Champions Trophy squad as the Caribbean Board tries to resolve a contracts dispute with its leading players, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said Wednesday.         
	The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) was forced to select a weakened squad for the event starting in South Africa on Tuesday due to the protracted row.         
	The Windies side is already in South Africa but concerns remain that the absence of big names such as Chris Gayle and all-rounder Dwayne Bravo would take away from the spectacle factor of the event.         
	The WICB and the player situation is quite complex, the ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said in a teleconference from its Dubai headquarters. Weve accepted it is absolutely their right to determine the team based on whatever challenges they face who is available and who is not, he said.         
	We have indicated to them that if there is an opportunity for them, if they resolve the issue and wish to change the team, we will try and do it as late in the day as possible.         
	The former champions open against Pakistan on September 23. Australia, Sri Lanka, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, New Zealand, England and hosts South Africa complete the line-up.         
	Given the breathing space, it remains to be seen whether the warring parties try to come to a rapprochement that would enable the WICB to send the best possible side to South Africa, with Gayle leading the proper Windies side.         
	The Champions Trophy will be a crucial test of whether the 50-over game is still relevant in the age of T20 cricket.         
	Lorgat compared the raging debate on the issue to concerns, raised a year ago, on the future of Test cricket. The ICC was open to innovations to boost the format but was against any radical changes, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arjuna moves court
                                                   Arjuna moves court
                      
	Colombo: Sri Lankas World Cup winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga has challenged the sports ministrys decision to sack him as Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) chief in the Supreme Court.         
	Ranatunga has filed a fundamental rights application in the countrys top court challenging sports minister Gamini Lokuges decision to remove him as head of the interim committee of SLC last month.         
	The former captain has prayed to the court to rule the sports ministers decision to remove him from the said post as null and void besides demanding Rs 15 million as compensation for the massive damage caused to his reputation.         
	Ranatunga in his application earlier this week, cited Lokuge, sports ministry secretary S. Liyanagamage and three others as respondents.         
	I briefed the authorities several times about the waste and corruption that is rampant in the cricket board, he was quoted as saying.         
	Corruption is rampant in the board today and none of authorities listened to me, he said.         
	My name has been slurred as several corrupt officials have made damaging allegations against me. That is why I wanted to go before the Court.         
	Last month, Lokuge dissolved the interim administration of SLC, headed by Ranatunga, saying the body needed an immediate change of guard. (PTI)

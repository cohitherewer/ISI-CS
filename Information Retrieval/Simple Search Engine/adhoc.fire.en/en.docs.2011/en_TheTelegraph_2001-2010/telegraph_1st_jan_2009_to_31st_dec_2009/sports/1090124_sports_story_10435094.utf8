                                                   EB look to play safe
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal, under new coach Subhas Bhowmick, will be aiming to turn things around when they embark on their second leg ONGC I-League journey, playing city rivals United SC at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.         
	On paper, a side with the greatest potential, East Bengals prime concern on Saturday will be the opponent coach Subrata Bhattacharjee.         
	According to some East Bengal players Bhattacharjee, who has had experience of coaching the red-and-gold brigade, could be a key factor because of his knowledge of the team.         
	Veteran coach Bhowmick too echoed these thoughts. While speaking about his opponents, the east Bengal coach said that United SC are a dangerous side and Bhattacharjee a good strategist.         
	Asked about his strategy, Bhowmick dismissed any suggestions of experimentation in his first match and hinted that his boys will play safe football.         
	We did experiment against the Bayern Munich team but the result was drastic At this moment I dont want to experiment, the coach said.         
	It was learnt that Bhowmick will go in for a 4-4-2 formation with Sunil Chetri and Yusif Yakubu likely to lead upfront. Mehtab Hossain, Dharamjit Singh, Jayanta Sen and Alvito DCunha will man the mid-field while Syed Rahim Nabi and Saumik Dey will be the right-back and left-back respectively.         
	Nirmal Chetri and Mehrajuddin Wadoo are likely be the two stoppers with Subrata Paul almost certain to be the custodian.         
	Injured Ghanaian Ismael Addo may miss Saturdays encounter while Suley Musah continues to be doubtful. United SC will miss the services of Subair Murithala Ali, Snehasish Chakraborty and Dhanarajan R. for Saturdays tie.         
	Although coach Subrata Bhattacharjee avoided the media, assistant coach Anjan Nath said: We will play our natural game East Bengal are a good side but we will play according to our plan.         
	Both East Bengal and United SC are on 12 points from 11 outings.         
	Meanwhile, a confident Mahindra United will take on Churchill Brothers in their 12th round I-League match on Saturday.

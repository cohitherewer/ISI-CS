                                                   India climb to second spot
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: World champions Australia slipped to third place in the Reliance Mobile ICC ODI Championship on Wednesday, their lowest since the world governing body introduced ratings in October 2002.         
	On Monday Australia collapsed to their seventh defeat in nine matches against top-ranked South Africa this year and now lie third in the rankings behind India.         
	However, Australia will climb back to second if they win the last match against South Africa in Johannesburg on Friday.         
	South Africa won Mondays fourth game by 61 runs to clinch the five-match series 3-1 with a match to spare. Australia held the top spot for all but 10 months of the duration, including 52 straight months from October 2002 to January 2007, ICC said in a statement.         
	If South Africa win on Friday, they will finish the series on 128 ratings points while Australia will head off to the United Arab Emirates to face Pakistan in a five-match ODI series in third place on 120 ratings points, trailing India by two.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hussey hesitant about IPL
                                                   Hussey hesitant about IPL
                      
	 Melbourne: Kolkata Knight Riders could be in for trouble after explosive batsman David Hussey revealed that he could follow Ricky Pontings path and stay away from the second edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Im sort of hoping to be playing in the one-dayers against South Africa and against Pakistan. Maybe a two-week window in the IPL, Im not really sure at the moment. I have to see how the body is holding up, he was quoted as saying on a website.         
	I desperately want to be part of the Ashes squad. Im hoping to finish off the Shield season in good form and get an Ashes berth, the way Cameron (White) is, Hussey said.         
	Meanwhile, injured England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff, who has been lapped up by IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings, is feeling the heat to skip the IPL after Ponting opted out of the event to keep himself fresh for Ashes series and the Twenty20 World Cup.         
	Flintoff, 31, injured his hip during Englands third Test against the West Indies and have been ruled out of the fourth Test following a scan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lewis leads McLaren 1-2 for pole
                                                   Lewis leads McLaren 1-2 for pole
                      
	Valencia: Lewis Hamilton took pole position for the European Grand Prix on Saturday to lead a McLaren 1-2 in qualifying.         
	Hamilton had a best lap of 1 minute, 39.498 seconds around the Valencia street circuit to give the defending Formula One champion his first pole of the season.         
	Teammate Heikki Kovalainen slipped up at the last corner on his final flying lap and will start Sundays race from second spot.         
	Clearly, we have very, very good pace this weekend, said Hamilton. We thought we would be competitive, but I dont think we thought wed be on the front row.         
	Brawn GPs Rubens Barrichello will start third ahead of Red Bulls Sebastian Vettel and Jenson Button.         
	Luca Badoer, who is replacing the injured Felipe Massa for Ferrari, qualified last on the 20-car grid on his return to F1 after a 10-year absence.         
	Kovalainen was poised to give Hamilton a run for pole but slid out as he came out of the penultimate turn to give Hamilton his 14th career pole and McLarens first 1-2 start since last years Hungarian GP.         
	I took it to the limit. You can always argue it could have been better, but in qualify it can go either way. I didnt lose more than one place so its fine, said Kovalainen.         
	Massa won here from pole position last year when the top three finished in the same positions as they started with Hamilton placing second.         
	McLarens Kers advantage  which provides a boost for overtaking and to defend challenges from other cars  is likely to make it a clear favourite, even if Hamiltons rear wing is still not fully fixed following an accident in practice on Friday.         
	Force Indias Adrian Sutil, who was quickest on Saturday in a final European Grand Prix practice, will begin four positions ahead of teammate Giancarlo Fisichella.         
	Equipped with new update in his VJM 02, Sutil clocked 1:38.846 in Q2 session to qualify for the 12th position. His Italian teammate Fisichella could not make it to Q2, falling just outside the top-15 bracket.         
	His timing of 1:39.531 in the opening session could only get him the 16th slot on the grid. (Agencies)

                                                   Vasco shock Sporting
                      
	Margao: Vasco upset Sporting Clube de Goa by a solitary goal to register their second win of the I-League, at the Nehru stadium here Sunday.         
	After a barren first half in this 12th round encounter, Vasco scored the all-important goal in the 67th minute through debutant Lester Fernandes.         
	Lester played in his first match for Vasco, showing a lot of promise on the left flank and combining well with the midfield to score the goal with a diving header from a free-kick.         
	Vasco now have eight points from 12 matches while Sporting Clube remain on top with 25 points from 12 matches. (PTI)

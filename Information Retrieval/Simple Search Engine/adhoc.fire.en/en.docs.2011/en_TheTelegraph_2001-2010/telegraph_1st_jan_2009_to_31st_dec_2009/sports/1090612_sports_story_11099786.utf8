	Nottingham: England recorded their lowest total in a Twenty20 International as South Africa bowled them out for just 111 before easing to a seven-wicket win in the World Cup Super Eight match on Thursday.         
	Although England did well to contain South Africa in reply, ultimately they were never able to defend their paltry score as the Proteas reached 114 for three with 10 balls to spare. Jacques Kallis batted patiently for his 57 not out.         
	England, who crashed to an embarrassing loss to The Netherlands in the tournament opener on Friday before thrashing Pakistan, again showed inconsistency in their 19th Twenty20 match.         
	Left-arm seam bowler Wayne Parnell, 19, claimed three for 14 from his 3.5 overs.         
	Fittingly, South Africa seamer Albie Morkel earlier bowled the first maiden (which included a wicket) of the tournament.           (REUTERS)

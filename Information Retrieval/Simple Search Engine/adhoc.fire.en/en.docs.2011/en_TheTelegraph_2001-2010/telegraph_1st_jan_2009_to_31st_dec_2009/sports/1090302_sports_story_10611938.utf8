	Bridgetown: Ramnaresh Sarwan completed a memorable double century on Sunday to spur the West Indies towards a position of safety at lunch on the fourth day of the fourth Test against England at Kensington Oval.               
	At midnight, the West Indies were 595 for six. Ramnaresh Sarwan (291) and Denesh Ramdin (100) were at the crease.               
	The home team, resuming on 398 for five, went to the break on 483 for five, within 117 runs of Englands formidable first-innings total of 600 for six declared.         
	The 28-year-old Sarwan, unbeaten 184 overnight, carried on to an unbeaten 229 against a flagging England attack. The stylish right-hander struck 24 fours and two sixes off 369 balls in just under 10 hours.         
	Sarwan shared an unbroken sixth-wicket stand of 149 with wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin, who hit an undefeated 56, his sixth Test 50 and first for nearly two years. Ramdin, overnight 25 not out, hit six fours off 120 balls in three hours and five minutes.         
	The pair had an early scare when a mix-up in running almost led to a run out but very little bothered either batsman after that. Sarwan brought up his second Test double century off 297 deliveries, with a flailing cut over the slips off James Anderson for his 21st boundary.         
	The referral system was again brought into play midway through the session when Ryan Sidebottom thought he had Sarwan leg before wicket on 208. But third umpire Daryl Harper correctly upheld on-field Aleem Dars not out verdict.         
	On Saturday, Sarwan, who notched up his third century of the series, and Shivnarine Chanderpaul, added an unbeaten 63 as the West Indies forged a strong reply to Englands huge total.         
	Chanderpaul joined Sarwan just before lunch, with the West Indies on 159 for three, and batted with typical discipline to register his highest score of the series. The 34-year-old batsman struck 10 fours off 113 balls in just over two hours.         
	Sarwan, already with scores of 107, 94 and 106 in this series, brought up his 14th Test century with a single to mid-on midway through the second session.         
	There were few alarms for the Guyanese pair apart from a few edges from Chanderpaul off the part-time medium pace of Ravi Bopara.         
	England are trailing 0-1 in the series after an embarrassing loss in the first Test when they were all out for 51 in the second innings.           (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hurdler tests positive
                                                   Hurdler tests positive
                      
	Berlin: Nigerian hurdler Amaka Ogoegbunam tested positive for doping at the World Championships and has been provisionally suspended, the IAAF said Friday.         
	Ogoegbunam was disqualified from the semi-finals of the 400m hurdles on Tuesday.         
	The 19-year-old Nigerian tested positive for the banned anabolic steroid metenolone after the race, IAAF spokesman Nick Davies said.         
	This athlete was also due to compete in the 4x400 for Nigeria, Davies said. Shes been provisionally suspended and so wont take part in the competition from now on.         
	In such doping cases, athletes can ask for their B sample to be tested. Davies said Ogoegbunam did not make such a request.         
	Ogoegbunam won three gold medals  including the 400m hurdles title  at the African Junior Championships earlier this month.         
	Steeplechaser Jamal Chatbi of Morocco is the only other positive athlete of the championships so far.         
	Meanwhile, just like the Jamaicans in the sprints, the Russians are perfect in the walking events at the World Championships.         
	Russia made it three-for-three Friday when Sergey Kirdyapkin used a late surge to win the 50km walk, the longest event of the nine-day Championships.         
	Kirdyapkin was as imposing as Valeriy Borchin and Olga Kaniskin were over 20km, giving Russia a clean sweep in the discipline.         
	Thats really the first time in history, and Im very happy that its the Russian team, Kirdyapkin said.         
	After Usain Bolt gave Jamaica a third straight sprinting gold with another world record performance in the 200 late Thursday, the biggest star of the championships will take a break on Friday.         
	Instead, Jamaica is expected to use a reserve during the heats of the 4x100m sprint relay on Friday. And dont count on the Jamaican relay runners to drop the baton during Fridays heats.         
	It would be the worst present possible for a man already celebrating exalted greatness at 23.         
	Bolt has boosted Jamaica to the top of the medal standings with five golds and nine overall.         
	The United States is second with four golds and 13 overall.         
	Kirdyapkins victory gave Russia three golds and 10 overall for third place.           (AP)

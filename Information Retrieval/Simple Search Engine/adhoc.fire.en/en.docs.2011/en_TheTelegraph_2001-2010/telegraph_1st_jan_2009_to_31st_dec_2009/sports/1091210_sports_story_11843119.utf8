The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bayern to the fore as Juve crumble
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bayern to the fore as Juve crumble
                      
	Belgrade: Bayern Munich secured a place in the Champions League last 16 with an impressive 4-1 win at Juventus as former European champions Real Madrid and AC Milan also advanced to the knockout stage on Tuesday.         
	Juventus were eliminated after Bayern came from behind to end the home sides 16-match unbeaten home run in Europes premier club competition.         
	Juventus, who only needed a draw to progress from Group A, looked set to go through after David Trezeguet volleyed the Italians into an early lead but a second-half collapse resulted in their most emphatic home defeat in Europe.         
	No one expected us to win like this so it makes the victory even better, Bayerns Dutch coach Louis Van Gaal told a news conference.         
	Croatia striker Ivica Olic was instrumental in Bayerns success. He won a penalty converted by goalkeeper Hans Joerg-Butt and then gave the German side the lead before Mario Gomez and Anatoly Tymoshchuk completed the rout.         
	Bayern finished as runners-up in the group, won by French champions Girondins Bordeaux who completed their impressive group stage campaign with a 1-0 success at Maccabi Haifa.         
	Its up to others to judge this elimination, rookie Juventus coach Ciro Ferrara told reporters when asked about his future.         
	In the last two matches we havent done anything to deserve to go through. Bayern were the superior side. They played like a great team and we had lots of problems.         
	A Cristiano Ronaldo brace and a third by Raul Albiol handed Real Madrid a 3-1 Group C win at Olympique Marseille, whose consolation is a place in the second-tier Europa League last 32 available to eight third-placed teams in the Champions League.         
	Ronaldo blasted home a 30m free-kick and scored an opportunist third after Raul Albiol had cancelled out Marseilles equaliser by Lucho Gonzales, who also missed a penalty with his side 2-1 down.         
	Milan, who drew 1-1 at Zurich, looked in danger after a Milan Gajic free kick gave the home side a 29th-minute lead, but Ronaldinhos penalty combined with Reals win saw the 2007 winners through.         
	Serbia winger Milos Krasic fired CSKA into the lead with an angled shot and midfielder Yevgeny Aldonin netted their injury time winner.         
	CSKA, who completed their recovery from a poor start with two wins and a draw in their final three games, could be joined in the last 16 by Russian champions Rubin Kazan.         
	Chelsea, who had earlier clinched Group D, were held to a surprise 2-2 home draw by Cypriots Apoel Nicosia while second-placed Porto eased to a 3-0 win at Atletico Madrid.         
	Chelsea fell behind to an early goal from Marcin Zewlakow. Quick goals by Michael Essien and Didier Drogba turned the match their way before Nenad Mirosavljevic forced a share of the spoils with a late equaliser.         
	Goals from Bruno Alves, Radamel Falcao and Hulk saw Porto crush Atletico, who still finished third in their group and sealed a Europa league berth thanks to a better head-to-head record against APOEL.

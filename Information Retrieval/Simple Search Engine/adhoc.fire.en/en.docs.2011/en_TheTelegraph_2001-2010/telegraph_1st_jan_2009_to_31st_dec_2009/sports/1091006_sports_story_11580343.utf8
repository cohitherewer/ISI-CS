                                                   Bagan can be champions, says Subrata
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Chirag United coach Subrata Bhattacharya believes if Mohun Bagan manage playing with the same spirit they showed on Monday, they can win the I-League.         
	Talking to reporters after his boys earned full points, defeating Mohun Bagan 3-2 in their opening I-League encounter, the veteran coach said: They (Mohun Bagan) are a very good side. If they can continue playing in the same spirit they showed Monday, I think they have a real good chance of winning the I-League.         
	Talking about his strategy on Monday, a calm and content Subrata said: I had asked my boys to play a positive game. I said, Whatever the situation, be aggressive. That helped. When you are playing against a big team, there will always be a psychological disadvantage. But My boys stayed positive.         
	Admitting that an injured Jose Ramirez Barreto leaving the ground helped their cause, Subrata said: Yes, that helped us a lot. That was the turning point.         
	Meanwhile, an unhappy Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa held poor referring responsible for the loss.         
	I feel the artificial problems, referring and opposition tactics took the match from us, the Moroccan said.

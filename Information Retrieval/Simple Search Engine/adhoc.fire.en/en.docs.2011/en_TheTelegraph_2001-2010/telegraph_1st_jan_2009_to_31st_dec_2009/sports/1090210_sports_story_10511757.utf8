	Calcutta/Colombo: India, the world champions in the shortest version of international cricket, will have a distinct edge over depleted hosts Sri Lanka when they lock horns in the only Twenty20 international on Tuesday.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhonis men dictated terms throughout the five-match ODI series winning 4-1 in the process. Sri Lanka will hope to carry forward the confidence they gained after winning the fifth and final match on Sunday.         
	Tillekeratne Dilshan will have an unenviable task at hand when he walks out for the toss on Tuesday with the hosts deciding to rest key players, including regular captain Mahela Jayawardene, deputy Kumar Sangakkara and the spin twins of Muttiah Muralidharan and Ajantha Mendis.         
	Having clinched the ODI series, the Indian team would be in a relaxed state of mind and Tuesdays match would be an ideal opportunity for the stroke players to light up the stadium with batting pyrotechnics.         
	Sachin Tendulkar, a victim of serial umpiring blunders, has already returned home but going by the kind of form Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir are in, the Lankan bowlers will have a tough time in taming the Delhi duo.         
	Containing someone like Yuvraj Singh will be no mean task either, as the Lankan bowlers have realised during the ODI series. Arguably the cleanest striker of the cricket ball, Yuvraj simply relishes the shortest format and if he gets going, he can win the match on his own.         
	Captain Dhoni has evolved his batting of late and moulded himself into a finisher but he still remains a swashbuckler who prefers to deal in fours and sixes. The likes of Suresh Raina and Rohit Sharma can improvise at will, while Yusuf Pathans prowess in using the long handle is beyond any doubt. The Indian bowling unit is no less effective though Zaheer Khan is likely to be rested. The likes of Ishant Sharma and Praveen Kumar might prove a handful for the Lankan batsmen.         
	In contrast, the new look Sri Lankan squad under Dilshan would have their task cut out against India. The absence of Jayawardene, Sangakkara, Nuwan Kulasekara, Muralidharan and Mendis does provide the fringe players an opportunity to impress the selectors but at the same time, it also renders the side low on experience.         
	Lasith Malinga returns to the Twenty20 side after being out of international cricket for nearly a year due to knee injury. The pacer would have to prove that he has not gathered rust in all these months. The Lankan side also includes 35-year-old Indika de Saram, who would be standing behind the stumps.         
	Teams         
	India (from): MS Dhoni (captain), Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma, Ravindra Jadeja, Yusuf Pathan, Irfan Pathan, Zaheer Khan, Praveen Kumar, Pragyan Ojha, Ishant Sharma and L. Balaji.         
	Sri Lanka (from): Tillekeratne Dilshan (captain), Sanath Jayasuriya, Jehan Mubarak, Chamara Kapugedera, Chamara Silva, Indika de Saram, Lasith Malinga, Dilhara Fernando, Farvez Mahroof, Kaushalya Weeraratne, Malinga Bandara, Jeevantha Kulatunga, Dilhara Lokuhettige, Mahela Udawatte and Thilan Thushara.         
	Match starts at 7 pm (IST).

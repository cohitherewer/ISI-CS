    - Waitress claims she had affair with superstar 
  -  World No.1 apologises for transgressions             Murray Wardrop                  Tiger Woods and Jaimee Grubbs                                           
	Jaimee Grubbs, a waitress who claims she had an affair with Tiger Woods, has alleged that the golfer sent her a message warning: My wife has been through my phone and may be calling you.         
	Jaimee, 24, from Los Angeles, told an US Weekly magazine that she started seeing Woods, the worlds highest-earning sportsman, in April 2007. She claims they had since had around 20 sexual encounters and said she could back up her claims with more than 300 racy phone text messages.         
	However, the cocktail waitress alleges that Woods left her a telephone message asking her to delete her name from her voicemail because his wife, Elin Nordegren, was checking his phone records.         
	Jaimee claims that the 33-year-old told her: Hey, its Tiger. I need you to do me a huge favour. Can you please take your name off your phone? My wife went through my phone and may be calling you. So if you can, please take your name off that.         
	Just have it as a number on the voicemail. You got to do this for me. Huge. Quickly. Bye.         
	She also alleges that the voicemail message was left on the day that Woods was accused of having an affair with Rachel Uchitel, 34, a former New York nightclub hostess.         
	According to Jaimee, she met Woods at a nightclub in Las Vegas on April 13, 2007. She claims they met again days later in San Diego when he invited her to his hotel and they had sex for the first time. She said that their last sexual encounter was in October.         
	Jaimee told a tabloid: He told me just last month, Quietly and secretly we will always be together. I loved how we got along. But I knew, in the back of my mind, there could never be just us.         
	There would always be the wife, or somebody else.         
	She added: Hes what my heart wanted. I never said, I love you because I never wanted to scare him off. But I was getting there.         
	Whatever happens with Elin, I hope Tiger and I can reconnect and remain good friends.         
	Woods and his wife, a Swede, have two children from their five-year marriage and were previously assumed to be the model of domestic bliss.         
	Despite Woodss protestations to the contrary, the crash has been widely linked to claims last week by another US gossip magazine, the National Enquirer, that the golfer had been having an affair with Rachel Uchitel.         
	Rachel has insisted that the rumours were false and that she had only met Woods twice. She said it was a coincidence that they stayed in the same hotel in Melbourne last month, while Woods was competing in the Australian Masters.         
	Everyone in the rapidly escalating story has now got lawyers, even the neighbours who called police about the car crash. Bill Sharpe, the neighbours lawyer, said Woodss injuries were consistent with a car wreck and inconsistent with him being beat up.         
	Earlier this year, Jaimee appeared on Tool Academy, a US reality television show on which girlfriends sent their lovers to a relationship boot camp.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

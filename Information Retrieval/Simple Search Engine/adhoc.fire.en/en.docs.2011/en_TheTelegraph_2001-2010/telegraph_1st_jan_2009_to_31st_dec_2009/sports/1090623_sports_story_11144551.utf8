The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Afridi likely for T20 captaincy
                                                   Afridi likely for T20 captaincy
                      
	Karachi: Flamboyant all-rounder Shahid Afridi, who after guiding Pakistan to the World Twenty20 title in Sundays final expressed willingness to lead the national team at least once before calling it quits, may soon get the opportunity.         
	The dream of Afridi, who cracked an unbeaten 40-ball 54 to help Pakistan beat Sri Lanka by eight wickets at Lords, may come true after Younis Khan stepped down as the T20 skipper.         
	Having regained his sublime touch with the bat and his bowling being a potent weapon, Afridi is now most likely to succeed Younis as the T20 skipper.         
	For the time being, Shoaib Malik is ruled out of contention for captaincy at any level and the way Afridi has performed and handled new found responsibilities as a senior player, he is certain to become the Pakistan captain for T20 cricket, a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official said.         
	If Afridi comes at the helm of countrys T20 squad, his first assignment will be the one-off match against Sri Lanka on August 12 during their tour to the island nation.         
	And indications are that Afridi will also be taking over as Pakistans one-day International captain if Younis decides to play the Test matches only. That might be far off as Younis has his eyes set on the 2011 World Cup, the official said.         
	While asked about his desire to captain the team, Afridi had earlier said: That is my ambition because it is an honour to lead your country.         
	Afridi also admitted that at one stage, when he was not scoring runs during the last two years, he was so frustrated that he had seriously thought about ending his career.         
	But it was my bowling that kept me going because my bowling had improved and was a big plus for the team. That is why I hung on. I am happy that I have finally found my batting form in this tournament, he said.         
	I told Younis I wanted to bat higher up because I was not getting enough time to settle down and play a longer innings. There was too much pressure on me to go and just start hitting out. He said if I had confidence I should bat higher up, Afridi added.         
	Meanwhile, the International Cricket Council (ICC) conducted a dope test on Shahid Afridi after his team won the final at Lords. Afridi, who was adjudged Man of the Match, was called for the surprise test by ICC officials after the match. The dope test is believed to be part of ICCs routine practice.

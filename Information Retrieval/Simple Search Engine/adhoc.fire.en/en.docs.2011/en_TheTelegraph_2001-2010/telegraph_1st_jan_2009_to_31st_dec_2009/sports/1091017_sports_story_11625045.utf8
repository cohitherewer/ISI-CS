The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Churchill held at home
                                                   Churchill held at home
                                R. Vashum      
	Margao: Mumbai FC came from behind to hold defending champions Churchill Brothers to a 1-1 draw, splitting points in a dull third round encounter of the I-League at the Nehru Stadium Friday.         
	Churchill went into the lead in the 26th minute through Reisangmi Vashum but Abhishek Yadavs 87th minute penalty cancelled that.         
	With two draws and a win Churchill now have five points while Mumbai FC, following two defeats, opened their account with the point earned from Fridays draw.         
	Churchill were a shadow of themselves in the absence of medios KhangThang Paite, Kalu Ogba and striker Odafe Okolie.         
	The Churchill goal came from a quick build-up on the left that saw Dan Ito play a forward pass to Felix Chimaokwu who raced into the box, got the better of a defender and squared the ball for the unmarked Vashum to score with a deft placement.         
	Chimaokwu, who lacked support upfront in the absence of Odafe, had an opportunity to increase the lead at the stroke of half-time after he intercepted a loose ball from defender Bernand Achaw. But his weak attempt was put out by keeper Nindhinlal who was substituted fifteen minutes from the end after he pulled a muscle.         
	The Mumbai side who relied on counter attacks had a good chance of restoring parity in the 35th minute when Kayne Vincent from the left send a cross which went a begging.         
	After the change of ends the visitors kept pressing for the equaliser and restored parity through a penalty in the dying minutes to snatch a valuable point from the defending champions.         
	The penalty was awarded by referee Pratap Singh after Nascimento Silveira brought Abhishek down inside the box and the striker himself converted the penalty.         
	Singh showed yellow cards to Churchills Charan Rai and Mumbai FCs Kayne Vincent.           (PTI)

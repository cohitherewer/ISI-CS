                                                   New crisis brewing in WI cricket
    - Trinidad amp; Tobago chief says some are advocating playing independently           A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                                        
	Calcutta/Port of Spain: The impasse in the West Indies, which has seen the one-time world beaters crash to a 0-2 humiliation at the hands of Bangladesh, threatens to permanently scar cricket in the region.         
	In fact, given the mood in Trinidad and Tobago, the West Indies team may no longer be the West Indies team.         
	Trinidad and Tobago, a nation which has, in Brian Lara, Learie Constantine, Wes Hall and Sonny Ramadhin, thrown up world beaters, is considering breaking away from the West Indies cricket.         
	Its to be seen if the other Caribbean countries follow suit and decide to play as independent nations.         
	Cricket in the West Indies is in crisis after leading players refused to play in the home series against Bangladesh due to contractual disputes with the regional board, and the tourists took advantage by winning both Tests against a weakened team.         
	Cricket, which has united the islands of the Caribbean for over a century, could be split if the chief of Trinidad and Tobagos cricket body follows through with his idea of competing as an independent nation.         
	In an interview published on Tuesday, Trinidad and Tobago Cricket Board (TTCB) chief executive Forbes Persaud said leading figures in the countrys cricket body were considering breaking away from the West Indies team.         
	My personal view (is) if the trend continues with the manner in which West Indies cricket is being administered, the board (TTCB) should go on its own and compete as Trinidad and Tobago, just as is in football, he told the Trinidad and Tobago Express.         
	If something is not done to have cricket administration at the West Indies level properly restructured, I believe we will have no choice but to think about playing as an individual territory on the international scene.         
	Trinidad and Tobago has been one of the traditional powerhouses of West Indian cricket along with Barbados and Jamaica.         
	Cricket is the only sport in which the former British colonies still compete as one unit  all the Caribbean nations play soccer and compete in the Olympics independently.         
	The West Indies Players Association, the players union at the centre of the dispute with the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) is based in Trinidad and on Sunday, leading Trinidad and international player Dwayne Bravo hit out at the WICB saying his local club was better organised than the regional body.         
	Persaud said that this was his personal view, adding that there had been no formal discussions at the board level  but other members shared his view.         
	There are some board members who believe that we should start thinking about going on our own but, this has not been discussed in any official forum. Its just people expressing their views informally.         
	Asked if such views were growing, Persaud responded: Yes. Because of the present situation in West Indies cricket, people are becoming very disenchanted and they have been expressing their views along these lines.         
	Persaud said that the process would not happen overnight.         
	Even if we were to go that way, it would be a very long drawn out process, he added.         
	It would have to go through the ICC and we must bear in mind the repercussions it is going to have and the impact it would have on the West Indian community since we know how passionate the Caribbean people are about cricket.         
	We all know how critical West Indies cricket is as a unifying force, to go that way would be destroying a legacy. It is not going to be an easy decision to make, if at all there is going to be a formal discussion on this.

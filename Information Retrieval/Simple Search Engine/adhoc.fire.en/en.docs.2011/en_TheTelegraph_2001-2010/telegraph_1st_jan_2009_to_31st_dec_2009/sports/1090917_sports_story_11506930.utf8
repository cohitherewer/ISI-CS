                                                     Tiwary, Saha in Rest squad
  - Bengal pacer Ashok Dinda finds berth in india blue for challenger series         A STAFF REPORTER                  Wriddhiman Saha amp; Manoj Tiwary                                  
	Calcutta: Virender Sehwag has been named captain of the 15-member Rest of India squad for the Irani Cup. The injured opener, out now, but in the Delhi DareDevils squad for the Champions League T20, will thus be making his comeback against Mumbai, last seasons Ranji Trophy winners, in Nagpur from October 1, the BCCI said in a release Wednesday after a meeting of its selection committee in Chennai.         
	Two players from Bengal feature in Sehwags team, Manoj Tiwary and Wriddhiman Saha. Manoj and Saha also secured berths for the Challenger Series with the wicketkeeper named in the India Red squad and Manoj part of India Green.         
	It will be a big chance for Manoj to impress the selectors after being dropped from the Delhi DareDevils 15-man squad for the Champions Trophy.         
	Ashok Dinda, who has made the India Blue squad, is the third player from Bengal with a Challenger ticket.         
	Sreesanth, Munaf Patel and Irfan Pathan bring up the Rest of India bowling department and the selectors have given the national side discards a chance to come back into reckoning.         
	Sreesanth last played for India against South Africa in Kanpur in April 2008 and has since struggled with his fitness. It will be one big chance for him to prove his fitness in front of the selectors before the forthcoming home series.         
	Notable absentees from the squads announced Wednesday are left-hand pacer Zaheer Khan and V.V.S. Laxman.         
	The pacer has been out of international cricket since missing the World Twenty20 in England picked up during the second edition of the IPL.         
	While the Team India spearhead will be continuing his recovery from the shoulder injury, the stylish right-hander, who is playing County cricket for Lancashire in the English domestic season that ends September 26, has been rested.         
	Those finding a berth in the Challenger squads include Saurabh Tiwary of Jharkhand and Assams Dhiraj Goswami.

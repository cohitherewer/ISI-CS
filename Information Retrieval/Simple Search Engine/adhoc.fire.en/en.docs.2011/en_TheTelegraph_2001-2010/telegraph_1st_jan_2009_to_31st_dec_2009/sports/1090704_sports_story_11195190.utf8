The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harmison scalps two
                                                   Harmison scalps two
                      
	Worcester: Stephen Harmison bolstered his chances for a place in the playing XI for the first Ashes Test at Cardiff on Wednesday as he pocketed two crucial wickets for the English Lions against Australia on the third day of the four-day match here. Harmison had claimed four for 80 in the Aussie first innings.         
	In an impressive new-ball display, Harmison removed both Phillip Hughes and Ricky Ponting cheaply.         
	However, an unbeaten century from Marcus North (106 ..) and Michael Clarkes well compiled 80 enabled the Australians to finish the day in a strong position.

            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: Diabolical may be hard to toss in the 1,600m Nanoli Stud Calcutta Gold Cup, Saturdays main attraction in the eight-event card. The Daniel David-trained horse has been winning his races with ease, despite a training setback following the Indian Derby victory two years ago. The Major Impact son is yet to taste defeat at the RCTC ground and he looks good to make it five in a row. A. Imran Khan partners the horse.

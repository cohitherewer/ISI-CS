	Perth: Australia were one wicket away from retaining the Frank Worrell Trophy when stumps were drawn on Saturday, the fourth day of their third Test against the West Indies.         
	However, the visitors need less than a miracle to win the Test. Chasing a target of 359, they were 308 for nine. What would give them hope is that the last-wicket pair of Kemar Roach and Gavin Tonge have already added 29 in a fearless manner.         
	The West Indies had Australia shuddering for half the day but four wickets in the last hour left the visitors on the verge of a 2-0 series win.         
	The match seemed headed for a quick finish when the Caribbeans were 68 for three at lunch. Dangermen Chris Gayle and Ramnaresh Sarwan were gone, but Narsingh Deonarine and Brendan Nash combined in a brave partnership to revive hopes of an West Indian victory. At the time of the scheduled end, Australia were three wickets away from the win. The decided to play the extra half hour, succeeding only in dismissing Sulieman Benn and Ravi Rampaul. Roach and Tonge took the game into the fifth day.         
	The West Indies had started to believe in a drawn series during the second session, when the 128-run stand between Deonarine and Nash was taking them closer to what would be the second-highest successful run chase at the ground.         
	At tea, Australias bowling looked ineffective, flat and as sick as Mitchell Johnson. By stumps, Johnson, who was suffering stomach problems, had bowled through the pain to gain three wickets.         
	Just as Pontings men started to wonder if they would go down again after setting a huge target, at this ground  last year South Africa pursued 414  they broke through twice in two overs.

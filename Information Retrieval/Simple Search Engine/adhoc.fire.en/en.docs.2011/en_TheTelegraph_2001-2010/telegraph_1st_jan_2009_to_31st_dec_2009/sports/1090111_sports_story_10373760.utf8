	Chennai: The stars continue to shine on Somdev Dev Varman. The 23-year-old had his name inscribed in the annals of Indian tennis on Saturday after he progressed to the singles final of the Chennai Open following his semi-final opponent, Rainer Schuettlers withdrawal owing to a wrist injury.         
	Dev Varmans maiden ATP Tour final appearance is also the first time an Indian is featuring in a summit clash since Leander Paess victory in the Newport event in 1998.         
	Dev Varman will meet Marin Cilic in Sundays final after the Croat defeated Marcel Granollers of Spain in the other semi-final.         
	Cilic, the third seed but title favourite after the two top seeds Nikolay Davydenko and Stanislas Wawrinka went out in the second round, came through a 6-4, 6-3 winner against the Spaniard.         
	The Chennai fans who had packed the Nungambakkam stadium to capacity would have gone home with mixed emotions. They did not get to see their young favourite match wits with the seasoned Schuettler  the 32-year-old is a former world No.5 and has four titles under his belt  but it was inevitable that they would have felt happy, considering what the match result meant.         
	Dev Varman, who will face Cilic in the final on Sunday, should feel happy irrespective of how the result has come, particularly when he has been assured of 150 ATP points and the $37,000 meant for the runner-up.

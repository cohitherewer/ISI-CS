	Kingston: England lost Alastair Cook and Ian Bell cheaply to leave them trailing the West Indies by 63 runs with eight wickets remaining at lunch on the fourth day of the first Test on Saturday.         
	Stuart Broad took his first five-wicket haul in Tests as the West Indies were bowled out for 392 before the tourists got off to a shaky start.         
	Opener Cook was caught by Devon Smith at second slip off Jerome Taylor without scoring.         
	Cook attempted to drive outside off stump and got a thick edge which Smith grasped at the second attempt.         
	West Indies captain Chris Gayle then turned to spin and was rewarded when, just two balls before lunch, left-armer Sulieman Benn removed Bell.         
	The England right-hander tried to cut but could only edge to wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin to leave England in trouble at 11 for two.         
	It was another good session for Benn who earlier had made a handy contribution with the bat after the West Indies resumed on 353 for seven.         
	Benn and Australian-born Brendan Nash produced a useful 30-run partnership before Broad broke through.         
	Benn made 23 from 36 balls before he edged Broad to Cook to ensure the England seamers career best figures.         
	Nash, who had held together the West Indies middle and lower order with a patient contribution on Friday, picked up his third half century from his opening four Test innings.         
	But then the 31-year-old, who qualifies for West Indies through Jamaican parentage, left with the genuine tailender Daren Powell, darted at Broad outside off stump and nicked to England keeper Matt Prior.         
	There were warm congratulations for the 22-year-old Broads achievement which came in his 11th Test.         
	Broad ended with figures of five for 85 off 29 overs on a surface that offered little help to seamers.         
	The West Indies innings ended when Steve Harmison claimed Daren Powells wicket, ruled caught behind despite a referral challenge from the West Indies tailender.         
	Although television images did not appear to show Powell made contact, the third umpire must have informed his on-field colleague that there was insufficient concrete evidence to overturn his initial ruling.         
	That left England with a tricky half-hour to negotiate and they will be disappointed to have lost two of their frontline batsmen.           (REUTERS)

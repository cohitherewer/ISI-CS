                                                     Somdev: Aim is to put India on singles map
                  Somdev Dev Varman                     
	New Delhi: Somdev Dev Varman wants Indian flag to flutter continuously on the ATP world tour.         
	With his lean frame and average height, he cut down the strapping bigwigs of the game to size, literally, en route to his maiden ATP final in Chennai last week.         
	The new tennis sensation avers that he has the heart to do more damage on the ATP tour.         
	Id surely like to be a permanent fixture on the ATP tour and do some damage and make a name. Id definitely like to put India on the singles map of the tour, he said from Melbourne, where he is playing Australian Open qualifiers.         
	In an extraordinary show in the season opener, Somdev, with sheer grit and never-say-die attitude, introduced to former world No.1 Carlos Moya and 610 Croat Ivo Karlovic a new brand of Indian tennis.         
	Asked if he feels had he been a little taller (at present 511) he could have been more destructive and challenge the tours elite in a better way, he responded with a stunner.         
	Well Im not going to grow any taller (laughs) but I am constantly working on becoming stronger. I dont think you can only be successful if youre over 64 tall. You just dont need height, you need a heart, which I have. You have to be physically strong and be able to take the challenges head on, he said.         
	When quizzed about his fearless approach, Somdev said: My hardwork gives me the confidence. I know Ive worked really hard and thats what gives me the faith in my abilities. For me fear is not a factor.         
	After playing just 14 events in six months, he is almost touching the top-150 mark. Is this an indicator of a sensational singles career India had been waiting for?         
	I surely do hope so. I know I have my work cut out and I have a long way to go. But I also know Im on the right path and I just need to keep working hard, he said.         
	With success, comes the weight of expectation from fans and inevitable scrutiny by the frenzied media. But the-23-year-old is unperturbed.         
	Well, my job is to focus on my tennis. I am motivated and focussed to be the best player I can be. I know there are expectations and pressure, but I dont focus on things that are not in my control. The best way to handle all that is by working hard at your tennis and getting results.         
	For his improved game, Somdev attributes a lot to the three-week training stint with Andy Roddick just ahead of the Chennai Open.         
	It has worked wonders for me. Training with him was such an incredible experience. He taught me a lot and I also got great insight into what it takes to become a top-10 player in the world. I know how hard I have to work if I have to compete with these guys on a regular basis.         
	Not only the Indian tennis fraternity but also the players who were humbled by him have applauded his performance. Moya even went to the extent of saying that Somdev will break into the top 100 soon.         
	The Indian said he does not believe in numbers game but acknowledged Moyas praise.         
	Its very nice of him to say that. I personally dont pay too much attention to numbers. It will happen when it has to happen. I am just concentrating on my tennis one day at a time. Having said that, Id like to be in that bracket sooner rather than later, he added.

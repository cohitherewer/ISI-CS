The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | New review system starts from today
                                                                                                                       7                                      New review system starts from today
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The decision review system (DRS), following extensive trials, will come into operation Tuesday, when Pakistan take on New Zealand in the first of their three-Test series, in Dunedin.         
	With the majority of players and match officials in favour of the system, and nine out of 10 full members of the International Cricket Council voting for it, it will also be used in the Australia versus West Indies series, which gets underway in Brisbane on Thursday, according to an ICC release.         
	David Richardson, ICC general manager, cricket, said: With the improvement of technology, umpires mistakes are exposed and scrutinised like never before. This system will help alleviate the problems created when mistakes are made.         
	In his report to the ICC following the trial, New Zealander Billy Bowden, of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Umpires, was effusive in his praise. Personally, having the DRS trial was the best thing since sliced bread, said Bowden.         
	Another umpire in agreement with the introduction of the system is ICC Umpire of the Year 2009, Aleem Dar.         
	I think it will help reduce the chances of mistakes made on the field, he said. I support the introduction of this system as it is designed to help umpires.

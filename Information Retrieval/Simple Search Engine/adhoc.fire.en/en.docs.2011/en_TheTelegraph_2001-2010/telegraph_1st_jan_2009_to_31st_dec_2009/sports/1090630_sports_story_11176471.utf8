The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I felt a sharp pain, says Ivanovic
                                                   I felt a sharp pain, says Ivanovic
                      
	London: Former French Open champion Ana Ivanovic hobbled out of the Wimbledon in tears on Monday after conceding her fourth-round match against defending champion Venus Williams.         
	Ivanovic was treated on the court with the trainer flexing her left leg. Her thigh was then bandaged and after a 10-minute break , the match resumed.         
	Ivanovic served out the game but was struggling badly and signalled to the umpire that she was unable to carry on.         
	I felt a sharp pain in my inner thigh and I couldnt stand, Ivanovic said.         
	Over the past few days I have felt muscle tightness but thats normal after playing so much on grass.         
	Speaking on the match Venus said: She (Ivanovic) didnt have a lot of opportunities in that first set and not because she wasnt playing well. I think I was just on top of the ball.         
	Venus, who played with tape on her left leg above and below the knee, said she was doing everything possible to keep mobile.         
	This is Wimbledon, it doesnt matter how much pain Im in, she said. Im going to keep playing.           (REUTERS)

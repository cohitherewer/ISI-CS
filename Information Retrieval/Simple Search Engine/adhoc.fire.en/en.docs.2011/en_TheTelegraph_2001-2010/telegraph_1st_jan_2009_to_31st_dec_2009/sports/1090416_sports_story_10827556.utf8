	Calcutta: East Bengal take on Dempo SC at the Barasat Stadium Thursday, the day the I-League title and the relegation are decided, with only pride at stake.         
	Both the teams are out of the title race, Dempo on the fourth spot with 30 points and East Bengal seventh with 27 points, and finding motivation therefore must be a tough task.         
	East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick though denied that motivation would be an issue saying that three points from the match would help them to end the league with a better standing. Motivation is not a problem.         
	You have to find your own motivation. With three points, we will move to 30 and if some other team falters, who knows, we will gain a few places on the league table, he said.         
	The red and gold brigade will be without five of their key players  Soumik Dey, Alvito DCunha, Rennedy Singh, Sunil Chetri and M. Suresh, but Bhowmick didnt seem in the least bit worried at the end of the practice session at the club ground on Wednesday.         
	Maybe I will try out a few fresh faces against Dempo, said the coach. According to Bhowmick, Nirmal Chetri may get a start Thursday. Praveen Kumar is set to partner Yusif Yakubu upfront in the absence of Sunil.         
	But Bhowmick was quick to point out that at present, the Goan side are probably the best in the country. As a team, they are playing the best football in the country.         
	The last match, which they lost, against Mohun Bagan was mostly dominated by them.         
	They play constructive football and Thursday, we would have to be at our destructive best to overpower them, he said.         
	Dempo, on the other hand, had a brief practice session at the Rabindra Sarobar Stadium on Wednesday where coach Armando Colaco made it clear that they were focusing on the AFC Cup and that the I-League was just a prestige issue.         
	According to reports, Beto and Sameer Naik may be rested for the match.

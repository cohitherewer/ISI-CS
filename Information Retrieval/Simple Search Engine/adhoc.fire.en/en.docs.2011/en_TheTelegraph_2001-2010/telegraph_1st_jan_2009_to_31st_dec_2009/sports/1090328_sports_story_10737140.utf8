The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United look for a point
                                                   United look for a point
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A point, just a point, by hook or by crook. Thats what United Sports Club coach Subrata Bhattacharya wants from his boys when they cross swords with Dempo Sports Club in an I-League match at the Barasat Stadium on Saturday afternoon.         
	Locked in a four-way battle to avoid the ignominy of being the 11th team in the I-League, with Mohammedan Sporting, JCT and Air-India  Vasco have already booked the last place  United need at least a point on Saturday to keep their hopes of beating the drop.         
	Now with 21 points from 19 matches, United have two away matches, against Mumbai FC and Vasco, respectively after the Saturday tie. And Bhattacharya is confident of getting at least four points from those two matches. We shouldnt lose on Saturday. And after that our last two matches are relatively easier. So I am confident of saving the relegation, Bhattacharya said.         
	United, for the record, will welcome back foreign recruits Daniel Bedemi and Subair Murithala Ali along with side-back Subhashish Roy Choudhury, all of whom missed the Mohun Bagan tie due to double bookings.         
	United would have been much higher on the I-League table had it not been for the profligacy of their strikers. In most of the matches, the likes of Murithala, Gauranga Datta and Sankar Oraon were in goalscoring positions but somehow failed to find the back of the net. Bhattacharya put that down to inexperience.

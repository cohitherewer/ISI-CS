The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saina is back at practice 
                                                   Saina is back at practice 
                      
	New Delhi: Desperate to be back on court to prepare for the World Championships starting next week, shuttler Saina Nehwal on Monday resumed training under coach Pullela Gopichand in his academy in Hyderabad.         
	A mild chicken pox had threatened her participation in the Championships but having almost recovered from the illness, Saina rushed to the academy in the afternoon.         
	I had a talk with the doctor and he said if I was feeling good then I can straightaway start my training. So I resumed my training today (Monday), played some matches, Saina said.         
	There is no complication now. I felt all right after the training, in fact I enjoyed it. It is so boring at home and I am happy that I could start training, she added.         
	Asked if Gopichand had given her a new training schedule, the Arjuna awardee said: I know he would ask me to do some light training for a couple of days and then heavy training for the next 2-3 days. He doesnt need to give me any schedule, whatever he will ask me to do, I will just follow that.         
	Her father Harvir Singh said Saina was desperate to be back to the court and just couldnt control herself, though Gopichand and her doctor had earlier planned for a Wednesday start.         
	Gopi had earlier planned for a Wednesday start to her training but Saina was so enthusiastic that she just couldnt control the urge to be back to the court, Harvir said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Unfit and dangerous ground forces call off
                                                     Unfit and dangerous ground forces call off
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Match Referee Alan Hurst (fourth from left) inspects the ground with umpires Tony Hill and Daryl Harper as Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Alastair Cook and West Indies captain Chris Gayle look on at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium in St Johns on Friday.

	St Johns: The poor outfield at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium here saw play abandoned for the day just 10 deliveries into the match after England were put in by the West Indies with the hosts voicing concerns over the surface and safety of the players.         
	Match referee Alan Hurst was called into the middle at 10.40am by umpires Daryl Harper and Tony Hill after the West Indies bowlers Jerome Taylor and Fidel Edwards struggled to run to the crease. Hurst declared the ground unfit and dangerous and felt the safety of the players was paramount in making the decision.         
	The bowlers are having problems with their footings. They were having trouble getting any traction at all, said Hurst. The umpires have agreed with that. It is a health hazard for the players. Play has been abandoned for the day as the ground is unfit.         
	Hurst dismissed suggestions that the International Cricket Council (ICC) should have done more to address the issue before the match got underway.         
	I dont think there was any doubt there was a problem before we came here with the sand on the ground but everyone thought it was ok. No one had bowled on the wicket to test it out. It would have been jumping the gun to say it was unfit before the start of play. In the long run, we have to look at the health and safety of the players. Rather than saying the game is abandoned, we are saying it is abandoned for the day, Hurst said.         
	I am not sure what the options are, maybe extend the time for the Test and play it at another venue. That will have to be a decision made by the boards and the ICC.         
	The heavily-sanded outfield quickly proved itself to be unsuitable for any play and while officials remain confident a solution can be reached, the chances of the game taking place at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium appear slim. In what play there was, England captain Andrew Strauss took advantage of a couple of loose deliveries to tuck into the gaps before an early morning shower arrived.         
	England dropped Ian Bell and Steve Harmison in their bid to level things. They were replaced by Owais Shah and James Anderson. Bells omission was widely anticipated after he failed to arrest a poor run at Sabina Park, where England were dismissed for a paltry 51 in the second innings.   
	HURST SPEAK  
	 Elite Panel Match Referee Alan Hurst issued the following statement after the first day of the second Test between the West Indies and England at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua was abandoned on Friday:  
	 ldquo;The decision to call off play for the day was taken by the on-field umpires Tony Hill and Daryl Harper in consultation with both captains because it was clear the ground conditions, especially the state of the bowlers rsquo; run-ups, were unfit and potentially dangerous.  
	 ldquo;I will now meet with the local authorities including the groundstaff, and the two Boards to see what options are available and a further announcement will be made in due course. rdquo;

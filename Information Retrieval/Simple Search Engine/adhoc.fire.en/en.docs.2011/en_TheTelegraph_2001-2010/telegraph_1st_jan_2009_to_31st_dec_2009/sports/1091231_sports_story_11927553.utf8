The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Stanley is ecstatic
                                                                                                                       7                                      Stanley is ecstatic
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                       
	Guwahati: An elated Lajong FC coach Stanley Rozario conceded that it was beyond his wildest imagination to upset Goan giants Churchill Brothers and march into the finals of the 31 st Hero Honda Federation Cup, that too in their first appearance in the tournament.         
	I am at top of the world. It was beyond my wildest imagination to beat a strong opponent like Churchill who have been doing so well throughout the season, and that too with so young a team. We have created history and its a big confidence booster for our young team, Rozario said after the 1-0 victory in the first semi-final at the Nehru Stadium here this evening.         
	On the other hand, Churchill coach Carlos Perreira, who was visibly upset, said: It is football and anything can happen anytime.         
	We missed a few good chances and Lajong played a good game. Our Federation Cup chapter is closed and now we will focus on the I-League, he remarked.

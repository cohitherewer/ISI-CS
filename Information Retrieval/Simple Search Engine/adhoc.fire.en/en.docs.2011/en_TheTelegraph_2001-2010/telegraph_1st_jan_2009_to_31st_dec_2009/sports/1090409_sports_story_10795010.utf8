The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Panel blames it on Prasun regime
                                                   Panel blames it on Prasun regime
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The special committee, appointed by the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), has held the previous administration responsible for the associations huge expenditure during the inaugural Indian Premier League (IPL) matches at the Eden.         
	The committee, chaired by former Justice Shyamal Sen, submitted its report on Tuesday. Justice Dilip Kumar Basu and N. P. Sengupta, were the other members of the committee.         
	The last regime, headed by Prasun Mukherjee, had spent Rs 7.26 crore in hosting the seven home matches of the Kolkata Knight Riders during the first season of the IPL. Red Chillies, the franchise owners of the KKR, are supposed to reimburse Rs 3.5 crore. So far so good. But it is the remaining Rs 4.66 crore, which is the cause of all the trouble.         
	According to sources, the 43-page report has recommended that the amount should be recovered from the previous regime.         
	The 2008 CAB office-bearers have said they were not experienced enough to organise seven matches in 36 days and that led to the huge expenditure.         
	The report will now be placed at the special general meeting of the association on Saturday, and a decision on the course of action is expected to be taken at the meeting. However, the chances of recovering the amount seems remote at this point of time.         
	Unsure of how to realise the amount, the CAB had claimed the money (Rs 4.66 crore) from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). But the current regime is now considering withdrawing that claim and a decision will be taken on Saturday. It was learnt that the BCCI office-bearers have assured the CAB that the Rs 10 crore, due to the association from the television rights, will be released if the CAB withdrew their Rs 4.66 crore claim.

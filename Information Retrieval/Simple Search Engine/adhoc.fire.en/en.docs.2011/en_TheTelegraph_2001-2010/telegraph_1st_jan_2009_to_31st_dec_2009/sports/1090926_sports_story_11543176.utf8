The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ferguson vote for Ben Foster
                                                     Ferguson vote for Ben Foster
                  Ryan Giggs                     
	London: Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson will persevere with Ben Foster despite the goalkeepers error-strewn start to the season. The England international gifted Manchester City their first goal at Old Trafford last weekend before the defending champions eventually beat their neighbour 4-3.         
	Despite Tomasz Kuszczak keeping a clean sheet in the League Cup victory over Wolverhampton on Wednesday, Ferguson will have Foster start at Stoke on Saturday and remain his first-choice Premier League goalkeeper while Edwin van der Sar recovers from injury.         
	Edwin is still three weeks away, Ferguson said Friday. It was a good opportunity for Tomasz to play on Wednesday, but Ben will start against Stoke. Hes not had a lot of game experience but hell be okay.         
	The Red Devils are second in the standings after six matches, three points behind Chelsea, thanks to Michael Owens stoppage time winner over City.         
	Ryan Giggs created each of Uniteds four goals to show that he remains a key component in the team at 35. The horrible part of being a footballer is that at some stage you are finished with the game, Ferguson said. It catches us all. When someone like Ryan is playing at the level he is at, he realises to stay there, he has to prepare himself in the right way.         
	He has to look after himself and do the right things. It is not a matter of him defying his age. It is more a case that there is no discernible deterioration in his game at all. It is remarkable.         
	Chelsea may be protecting a 100 per cent record at Wigan on Saturday, but manager Carlo Ancelotti knows it wont last forever. Its very difficult because now the team is doing very well, Ancelotti said Friday. We have maintained a good control of the injury situation and we have players in good condition and there is a good atmosphere.         
	Winger Florent Malouda has attributed Chelsea winning six straight games to the play of strikers Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka. If you are an opponent and you see Didier and Nicolas are playing against you, you wont feel comfortable, Malouda said.         
	Meanwhile both Andrei Arshavin and Theo Walcott should return for Arsenal which plays at Fulham in Saturdays late kickoff. Arshavin has missed four matches with a groin problem, while Walcott has not played this season due to a side strain as the Gunners have lost twice and fallen nine points behind Chelsea. We are very pleased because Arshavin gives us an attacking option that is always very interesting and away from home hes always very efficient as well, manager Arsene Wenger said.         
	Third-placed Liverpool missed out on the title last season in part because of its seven home draws, one of which was against newcomer Hull, which is back at Anfield on Saturday.         
	Level with Liverpool on 12 points are Manchester City, which hosts West Ham on Monday, Aston Villa, which is at Blackburn on Saturday, and Tottenham, which hosts Burnley at the same time.         
	In Saturdays other matches: Portsmouth, searching for their first point of the season, hosts Everton and Bolton is at Birmingham. In Sundays only match, Sunderland hosts Wolverhampton.

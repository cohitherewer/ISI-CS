                                                   Alvito ready to take pay cut to stay
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The effects of the global meltdown on Indias club football was made evident Saturday when East Bengals senior-pro Alvito DCunha said he was ready for a pay cut to remain in the clubs scheme of things next season.         
	East Bengals brand ambassador said he was disappointed with his performance in the 2008-09 season, during which he often found himself on the bench due to injuries.         
	I would like to apologise to the supporters for not being able to give my 100 per cent and not being able to play due to injuries. We had a good team this season and the players should be blamed for the performance, the Goan footballer said.         
	The former India footballer said he hoped to serve the club well next season, if he is retained.         
	Im confident of bouncing back next season and thats why I dont have a problem if theres a pay cut for me.         
	I have not been able to give back anything to the club this season, so I want to repay them and I know I can still play well.         
	Alvito denied there was any official communication from the club for him to convince the East Bengal players to accept a cut in salaries.         
	I am convinced that there would be no problems with the salaries for the remainder of the season. But for the next season, I can say that the players should get what they are promised. The footballers are also professionals and its our bread and butter, he said.         
	The midfielder said a coach should be given time to settle down and blamed inconsistency as the primary reason for East Bengals dismal performance in the current season. The red and gold brigade have had three coaches  Manoranjan Bhattacharjee, Stanley Rozario and Subhas Bhowmick  during the season.         
	Our bad performance is our fault. We were largely inconsistent throughout the season. Personally, I think the coaches should be given time to settle down.         
	A senior East Bengal footballer, however, said the pay-cut proposal was Alvitos personal decision and didnt reflect the other players view.         
	It is his personal decision. We are all professional players. For us money is as important as the clubs prestige for us, the footballer said on condition of anonymity.         
	The club should respect our contracts. Theres no question of accepting a pay-cut. If the club breaks the contracts, its illegal.

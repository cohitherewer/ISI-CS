	Madrid/Milan: Juan Arango and Cleber Santana scored second-half goals on Sunday as Mallorca came from a goal down to beat champions Barcelona 2-1 in their first game since winning the Spanish league title.         
	Barcelona, who won the title for the 19th time on Saturday after their closest rivals Real Madrid lost 3-2 at Villarreal, were applauded onto the Ono Estadi field by Mallorca players in recognition of their success.         
	Meanwhile, newly-crowned champions Inter Milan provided the display their fans wanted by beating Siena 3-0 at the San Siro on Sunday in the Serie A.         
	AC Milans 2-1 loss to Udinese on Saturday night ensured Inter would begin the match with the title already won, but goals from Esteban Cambiasso, Mario Balotelli and Zlatan Ibrahimovic gave the supporters a result to celebrate. The title is Inters fourth consecutive championship and 17th in total.         
	Samuel Eto gave a depleted Barca side a 10th-minute lead with a looping header from Bojan Krkics cross.         
	Arango equalised in the 73rd minute and Santana headed home from Jose Manuel Jurados cross five minutes later to inflict Barcelonas fourth defeat in 36 games this season  and their first since March 1.

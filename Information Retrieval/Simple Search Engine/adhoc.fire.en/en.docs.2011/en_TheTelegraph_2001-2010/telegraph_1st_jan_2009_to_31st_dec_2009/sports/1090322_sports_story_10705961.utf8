                                                   Buchanan: Need to save cricket
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former Australia coach and current Kolkata Knight Riders cricket manager John Buchanan advocated a return to normalcy for cricket, post the March 3 terror attack on the Sri Lanka cricketers in Lahore.         
	Speaking on the sidelines of the KKR camp at the Eden, Buchanan said: We all know what happened to the Sri Lanka cricketers in Lahore But at this moment we need to be back to a normal situation. We need to save cricket and togetherness is important.         
	Asked on the cricketers dilemma regarding the current security scenario in the subcontinent, Buchanan said the decision should be left to the individual.         
	The decision should be individual... Indian Premier League (IPL) is a high-profile tournament. I think enough security is going to be provided We are hoping for the best, the former Australia coach, who arrived in the city late on Friday, said.         
	He, however, declined to comment on the tentative schedule for KKRs home matches, where they might have to play seven matches at the Eden in 15 days.         
	The Knight Riders cricket manager also showered praise on Team India for their emphatic Test win in Hamilton on Saturday.         
	Meanwhile, the first phase of KKRs preparatory camp for the second edition of the IPL got over on Saturday. Sourav Ganguly skipped practice.         
	The final squad will be announced on Sunday, though, the strength is yet to be decided.         
	Apart from the 10 foreigners, Sourav Ganguly, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Wriddhiman Saha, Ashok Dinda, Ajit Agarkar, Ishant Sharma, Murali Kartik and Aakash Chopra are the other certainties. Saurashtras Cheteshwar Pujara is also confirmed to make the cut.         
	Monish Parmar, Sachin Rana, Sunny Singh, Shatrunjay Gaekwad and Natraj Behera are also tipped to make the cut. Left-arm spinner Iqbal Abdullah and all-rounder Yashpal Singh have also impressed the think-tank.

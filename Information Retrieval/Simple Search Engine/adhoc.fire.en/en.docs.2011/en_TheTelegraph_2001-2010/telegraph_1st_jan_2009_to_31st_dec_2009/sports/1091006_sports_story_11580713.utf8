The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting to play in IPL 2010
                                                     Ponting to play in IPL 2010
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI    
	Johannesburg: Australia captain Ricky Ponting, who skipped this years IPL, will honour his 2010 commitment to the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	I wont be there for the full period, because Australia will be touring New Zealand, but will be with the Knights for the latter part of the 2010 edition, Ponting told The Telegraph in neighbouring Centurion.         
	Ponting, in fact, has played only a handful of matches for the Knights. For, last year, in the inaugural event, he had to leave early because of the series in the West Indies.         
	As of now, Ponting has no obligations beyond the third edition (to be held in March-April), which stands to be really critical for the Knights.

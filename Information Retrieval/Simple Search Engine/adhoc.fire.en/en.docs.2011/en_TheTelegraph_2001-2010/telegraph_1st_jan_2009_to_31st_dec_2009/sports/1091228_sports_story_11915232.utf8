	It was not easy. My opponents rating is 2256, but he is a talented player. Sasikiran said after the game. Though we expected to win, we did not underestimate them. We are happy to win the championship he said.         
	With India A assured of gold, the race for the silver medal gathered momentum as both hopefuls  Vietnam and Iran  stayed in the hunt, trouncing Indonesia and Sri Lanka, respectively by identical 4-0 margins to take their match points to nine.         
	Vietnam, though, are better-placed since they meet minnows Nepal in the last round.         
	Iran face tough opposition in India B who have eight match points. India B defeated Yemen 3-1, but surprisingly conceded two draws.         
	In the womens section, Vietnam are well placed to take gold as they have 11 match points and need only a draw against Nepal to confirm their gold medal.         
	The womens India A team took their tally to nine match points by beating Bangladesh 4-0 but after having received the dreaded bye in the last round, will get only one match point. India B outwitted Sri Lanka and also took their tally to 9 match points. They meet Iran in the final round and a win should get them the silver, ahead of India A.         
	The final round will be played Monday from ten in the morning with prize distribution at four.

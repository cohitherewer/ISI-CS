            STAR RACER                          Grand Madame (Prakash-up) with D. David                            
	Calcutta: Trainer Daniel Davids even-money favourite filly Grand Madame walked away with the 2,400m Calcutta Oaks on Sunday, thanks to jockey Chris Hayes who rode a mindless race astride the second-favourite, Colourful Lady. The visiting jockey was seen galloping the Lady six to eight wide throughout the trip. Colourful Lady hails from the Mumbai-based trainer Imtiaz Saits yard. The trainer, however, failed to make it to the city. Hayes was, nevertheless, at his usual best atop Bharath Singh-winners, Galashiels and Sanqusar, in their respective events.           
	The Calcutta Gold Cup, in contrast, was a clean victory for Daniels champion-horse, Diabolical, who won the premier event virtually from the start. Daniel finished the afternoon with a quadruple of wins.

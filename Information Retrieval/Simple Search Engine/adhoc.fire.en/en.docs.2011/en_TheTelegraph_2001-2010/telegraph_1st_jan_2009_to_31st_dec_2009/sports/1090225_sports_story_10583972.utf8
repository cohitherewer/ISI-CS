                                                     Containing Indian openers will be crucial, says Vettori
            A CORRESPONDENT               Daniel Vettori                      
	Christchurch: Taming Indias swashbuckling opening pair of Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir will be crucial to New Zealands success, home team captain Daniel Vettori said on Tuesday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On the series         
	I think its gonna be a very good series. India have come with a formidable reputation, the one that theyve earned over the last couple of years with the way theyve played cricket Obviously theyre ranked higher than us in both forms of the game. But I suppose we enjoy playing at home, we feel a lot more comfortable here and weve got a pretty good record. Hopefully those things play in our favour but we also understand this is one of our biggest challenges and obviously coming off Australia was a huge challenge. We are hoping to continue our form from there.         
	On his relatively inexperienced side  
	There are a lot of guys who have played under 10 games but a lot of those were won. So when you have that feeling within the team coupled with some experienced players, it makes for confidence about their performances. Were hoping to continue on that, the likes of Mark Guptills and Neil Brooms being fantastic in the short time theyve been there and were hoping they can capitalise on what theyve done in a short period of time.  
	Jacob Orams presence         
	Jacobs a huge help, in my opinion hes the most important player of the team because of his allround ability though he is not bringing the bowling aspect at this stage. He is slowly building up but will not bowl in the Twenty20. Hes a world class player and his record speaks for itself.         
	The impact of Twenty20 in New Zealand         
	It is pretty exciting, the first chance for the New Zealand public to see the Indian team in action. They play an aggressive brand of cricket. The likes of Brendon McCullum and Ross Taylor at the top order means theres probably going to be a lot of runs being scored. Its going to be a good game.         
	If the home team enjoys an advantage         
	I think it comes back to our conditions, and hopefully we know those and we can perform in them. I think the wickets are going to be very good, the weather may play a small part in it but ability to contain the Indian top-order, with the likes of Sehwag and Gambhir in it, is probably going to be crucial to our success.         
	Home expectations         
	The level of expectation comes with every series at home. Last year even though England was playing some really good cricket and were nearly at the top of world cricket, there was still expectation that the New Zealand team should know these conditions and should understand how to play a lot better than the opposition. I suppose with the Indians not touring that well the last time puts more pressure on us. But I look at it as one of the better challenges. If you look at their batting line-up and their records and statistics, you will sit back in awe. Theyve got a pretty impressive seam attack and one of the best spinners in the world in Harbhajan Singh. For us and for me its a test to be on top of our game and make sure the plans are in place and good enough to beat them.                   
	John Wrights role         
	Hes around the team a lot and we enjoy his experience and are lucky enough to have a fellow who has knowledge about the Indian side. So weve been picking his brain for a while Not just with individual aspects of the players but taking on the Indian team and what things he thought worked in the past when they were successful. If we can replicate that         
	The Indians strengths         
	Sehwag creates a momentum at the top of the order and is such an aggressive player that he can take the game away quite quickly. A lot of our emphasis is on him and probably Gambhir with their opening partnership. If we can put some pressure on India early then may be it gives us a chance, but when these guys get away, its always hard to pull back in.         
	On Yuvraj Singh         
	We are not underestimating him as a player and know how destructive he can be. We are just hoping that we get to him early by our plans for Gambhir and Sehwag. If we can do that he will hopefully be more vulnerable than when he comes in with a bit of platform. But he still is a very good player and is in some very good form as well.         
	On the wickets this time         
	In the last four or five years, the wickets have been pretty good, theyve generally been flat.         
	Injury updates         
	Ross Taylor has gone through most of the routine, been at the nets and looks pretty good there and done more things than light jogging. But well take a decision on him tomorrow and I am hopeful he will play an important part. Ian Butler has slight injury problem but apart from that the team is in good order.         
	T20 World Cup preparations         
	I think weve been planning for a little while now, were trying to get a team in place. There can be successful days, obviously conditions are going to be very difficult but wed try and build that experience so that when we get to the World Cup there would be lot of guys who had been through the situation.         
	On Jesse Ryder         
	Hes been good. Obviously, hes disappointed with his injury in Australia and not getting an opportunity over there but I think hes another guy who feels comfortable at home and has performed well at home. The McCullum-Ryder partnership was the key to us winning the England series last year.         
	On new manager David Curry         
	I think its for him to get a feel of the side. He has a lot of experience with Commonwealth Games teams, cricket is a different avenue for him but he has the personality that really seems to fit with the group and I know that its exciting to be with him.         
	If it would be a different experience to deal with someone from outside the cricket culture  
	Cricket is a tough game, with different logistics. I know the different styles of it. Myself and Andy (coach Moles) will have to get Dave quickly up to the cricket side of things but the other side of things he brings, he is pretty adept there. I think you always build up relations with some people and are sorry to see some people go. Its a fresh start in New Zealand Cricket and weve got one of the best in Dave.  
	On spinner Nathan McCullum         
	Nathan McCullum has been extremely impressive in what he has done so far. I think his batting brings a lot to the table and is one of the better fielders in the side. Hes the sort of guy who brings all three aspects to his game and should get an opportunity Wednesday.

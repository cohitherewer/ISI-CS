The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lanka build a huge lead
                                                   Lanka build a huge lead
                      
	Colombo: Sri Lanka seized control of the second Test against New Zealand on Friday as they reached stumps on 157 for two with a lead of 339 runs.         
	Spinners Rangana Herath and Muttiah Muralidharan combined to take six wickets in dismissing New Zealand for 234 on the third morning.         
	Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara gave his team another solid platform with an unbeaten 64 from 90 balls, a fluent innings that included seven fours and a six.         
	The left-hander shared an unbroken partnership of 68 with Mahela Jayawardene, who scored 23 not out, before rain curtailed the days play 12 overs early.         
	Tillakaratne Dilshan was the first casualty of the second innings, caught for 33 off-spinner Jeetan Patel.         
	Just before tea, opener Tharanga Paranavitana (34) was adjudged to have gloved an attempted sweep off Daniel Vettori and was given out caught behind.         
	New Zealand, trailing 0-1 in the two-game series, resumed on 159 for five before losing their remaining batsmen for 51 runs as Sri Lanka forged a formidable 182-run lead.         
	Off spinner Muralidharan claimed three for 71 from 25.4 overs and left-armer Herath took three for 70 from 34 overs.         
	Sri Lanka reached the lunch interval on two without loss in their second innings with both Dilshan and Tharanga Paranavitana on one not out.         
	Ross Taylor was New Zealands top scorer with a three-hour 81 from 155 balls with 10 boundaries.         
	Brendon McCullum (18) was the first to fall in the morning as he edged Muralidharan to Mahela Jayawardene at slip, the former captains 150th catch in Test cricket.         
	Herath then claimed the key scalp of Taylor, the right-hander edging behind.           (REUTERS)

                                                   Making a point over figures
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Prasun Mukherjee camp has raised objections to some of the observations in the special committee report into the huge expenditure during the inaugural edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	The previous CAB regime, headed by Mukherjee, had spent Rs 8.26 crore in hosting the seven home matches of the Kolkata Knight Riders. Red Chillies, the franchise owners of the KKR, are supposed to reimburse only Rs 3.5 crore, and the problem is with the remaining Rs 4.76 crore. However, the Mukherjee camp is only contesting expenditure close to Rs 20 lakh.         
	Somebody speaking on behalf of the Mukherjee camp said: The report has pointed some unnecessary expenses and irregularities during the hosting of the IPL matches which include an expenditure of Rs 1.44 lakh for hosting a lunch by Lalit Modi at a city five-star hotel, Rs 13.01 lakh on a tri-vision sight screen and Rs 5 lakh paid to Arun Sign Services.         
	The lunch was to be hosted by Modi but due to unavoidable circumstances his visit was cancelled at the last minute. But there was no time to cancel the function. If the CAB wishes they can still claim the amount from Modi. Why havent they approached Modi? he asked.         
	As for the tri-vision sight screen, Rs 7 lakh was spent on hiring charges and the rest for the person who came from Chennai for its supervision and spent 38 days here. If we had bought the screen it would have meant incurring a cost of Rs 14 lakh plus the amount spent on the personnel for its maintenance and supervision. This would amount to approximately Rs 22 lakh. We didnt wish to increase the costs in this fashion.         
	Rs 10 lakh was due from Arun Sign during the Pakistan Test match for advertising on the gates without informing the CAB. With the deadline approaching and pressure from the police, we were forced to pay Rs 5 lakh to them to expedite the work as non payment would have meant further complications. The CAB can still take them to court for not paying the amount.

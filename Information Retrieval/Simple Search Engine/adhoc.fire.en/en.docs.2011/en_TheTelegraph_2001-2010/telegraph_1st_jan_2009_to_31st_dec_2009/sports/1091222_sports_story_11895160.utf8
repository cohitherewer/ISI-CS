The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis back in action
                                                                                                                       7                                      Younis back in action
                      
	Karachi: Former Pakistan skipper Younis Khan, after his brief exile from cricket, returned to play for his domestic side Habib Bank in the final of Quaid-e-Azam Trophy at the National Stadium here Monday.         
	Younis, however, had a mixed outing on the opening day, as he was dismissed cheaply for seven, but picked up two crucial wickets. It was the first appearance of Younis in domestic cricket since he pulled out from the New Zealand tour, on the grounds that he wants to take a break from cricket.         
	It was good to see him back on the field as he remains a key player for Pakistan, chief selector Iqbal Qasim said.         
	Five national selectors were present at the National Stadium to watch Younis in action, although Qasim insisted they were there to watch all those playing in the match.(PTI)

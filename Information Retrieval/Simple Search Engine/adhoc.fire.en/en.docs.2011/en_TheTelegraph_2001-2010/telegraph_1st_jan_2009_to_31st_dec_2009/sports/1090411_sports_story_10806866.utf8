                                                   India face Pak test
                      
	Ipoh: India will have to guard against late defensive lapses when they take on arch-rivals Pakistan in a do-or-die league match in the Azlan Shah hockey tournament Saturday. India must win to reach the final.         
	India have conceded late equalisers in two of the three matches they have played so far, and Sandeep Singhs men, who were runners up last year, cannot afford such a lapse against Pakistan.         
	Pakistan, who lost two of their three league games, have suddenly jumped back into contention after beating Egypt.         
	Pakistan earlier lost to Malaysia and New Zealand.         
	A win Saturday might just be enough to get them a berth in the finals. India have five points from their three games, while Pakistan have three.         
	Malaysia are at the top of the table with six points and their opponents Saturday, New Zealand, have five points.           (PTI)

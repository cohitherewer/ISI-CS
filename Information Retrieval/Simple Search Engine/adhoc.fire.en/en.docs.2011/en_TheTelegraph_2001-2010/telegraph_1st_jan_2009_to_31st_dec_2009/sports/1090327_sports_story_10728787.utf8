                                                   Im happy with McLaren: Hamilton
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                       
	Melbourne: Lewis Hamilton has insisted he is fully committed to McLaren after appearing to throw his future with the team into doubt by claiming he would listen to offers from a rival team should he be approached.         
	Sparking speculation, Hamilton recently said: I havent had offers from other teams, and I am not talking to anyone. But I would listen to an offer if someone asked. It would be a compliment, and it would be silly if I did not.         
	After clinching the Formula One world title last year, the 24-year-old pledged his allegiance to the Woking-based team, claiming he wanted to remain with them for the rest of his career.         
	Despite the remarks over his future, nothing has changed as far as Hamilton is concerned as he on Thursday quantified his words.         
	Im happy where I am, Hamilton said.         
	It doesnt really have any grounds. All I said was that its quite cool if you find out other teams are interested in you. Its good to know you are wanted. I honestly want to see out my career with McLaren. I do feel its my family, its where I am right now and its where Im happy.         
	Earlier on Thursday Hamilton enjoyed a gentle introduction to the new F1 season with one of the worlds greatest cricketers. Hamilton, team-mate Heikki Kovalainen and Australia legend Shane Warne were all on hand to promote two programmes supported by The Vodafone Foundation for a game of backyard cricket.         
	The F1 drivers competed against two members of the public from the World of Difference campaign, an initiative that provides volunteers with an opportunity to go on placement with a chosen charity for a year.         
	With a rubber ball, a boundary on the leg side just 20 yards away, and Warne bowling gentle spinners, Hamilton emerged the star turn by smashing three sixes. But he knows it will not be so easy at this weekends Australian Grand Prix when he begins the defence of his title.         
	McLarens aerodynamic problems in testing in recent weeks are well documented, although at the conclusion of the last test in Jerez, they appeared to have made up considerable ground.         
	Not enough, though, according to Hamilton as he let the cat out of the bag when asked as to who his main rivals will be this season.         
	Pretty much the same people will be up there as last year  apart from maybe us, quot; confessed Hamilton with an embarrassed chuckle.         
	McLaren have been working around the clock to correct the issues, and they have made significant progress from just a few weeks ago when it quickly became apparent they were well off the pace.         
	Hamilton knows there is now little he can do at Melbournes Albert Park on Sunday, other than give it his all.         
	Its been a long, long break since the last Grand Prix, and weve come here not knowing what to expect, said the 24-year-old.         
	I feel very proud to be here as world champion, to have realised a dream I had long held. I have reset my targets, and the goal now is to be world champion again. You can improve and you can always try to be better. Now we will just try to do the best job we can.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Md. Sporting pin hopes on Gray
                                                   Md. Sporting pin hopes on Gray
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mohammedan Sporting will be hoping the arrival of overseas replacement Eugene Gray leads them to a morale-boosting victory when they take on the formidable Air India at the Cooperage here Sunday.         
	Mohammedan Sporting signed up Gray, who was playing in the Indonesian league, in place of striker Theodore Sunday who had missed most of the season with an injury.         
	It will be a homecoming of sorts for Gray as he had played earlier for Mohammedan besides United SC and East Bengal in the national league. But the Calcutta outfit, languishing at second from bottom on the league table with just two wins, will still have to do without Gautam Thakur, Anit Ghosh and Shaikh Azim all of whom are ruled out due to injury.         
	It will be some task for the visitors to lift themselves from the 3-0 thrashing they received at the hands of Mumbai FC at the same venue only four days ago.         
	We have to play well. One more defeat and things will be really difficult after that, coach Shabbir Ali said on the eve of the match.         
	Mohammedan had the shackles on Mumbai FC for the first 15 minutes or so on Monday but thereafter were outplayed by the hosts, both on the pitch and the drawing board.

	 Barnes set to join Chargers
    Johannesburg: South African bowling coach Victor Barnes will work with the Deccan Chargers team for the rest of the Indian Premier League (IPL). Barnes, who is currently the bowling coach of the South African national team, was asked by the Chargers coach Darren Lehman to help his bowlers.         
	Darren Lehman asked me to join the team and help the boys and I was only glad to help, said Barnes. I am mainly working with the fringe bowlers. A few of them had problems with over stepping. We worked on it and things are getting better, he added.               
	 Sehwag happy 
    Bloemfontein: The Delhi DareDevils captain Virender Sehwag asserted that his sides morale remained high despite the six-wicket defeat to the Kings XI Punjab, but warned against complacency ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) semi-finals. I dont think the loss will affect team morale because we have won six or seven consecutive games. We hope to put up a good show. The atmosphere is very good, everybody is happy, Sehwag said. He indicated Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath, who has so far been warming the bench, could get his first chance of this season in the DareDevils next game.               
	 SLC offer
    Chennai: The Sri Lankan players who had signed up with the unofficial Indian Cricket League (ICL) will be considered for international selection if they sever ties with the rebel organisation, the countrys cricket board said. Sri Lanka Cricket is pleased to announce the decision made to grant amnesty to the individuals who have been a part of the ICL, which has been a controversial issue in the cricket world, the board said on its website. Setting June 15 as the deadline, the board said players and officials would be readmitted immediately into domestic cricket but would have to serve a cooling period of three months before being considered for international assignments.

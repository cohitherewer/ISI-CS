                                                     Simmons: Present state of West Indies cricket hurts 
    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -   Ireland coach picks Sri Lanka as the team to watch             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                    
	Nottingham: Phil Simmons, who played 26 Tests and 143 ODIs for the West Indies, at a time they still were a force to reckon with, has been coaching Ireland for the past two years. On Tuesday evening, the Dublin-based Simmons, now 46, spoke to The Telegraph.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q How has the Ireland experience been?         
	A Good, Id say. We arent fully professional, but try to think and work like professionals... Im trying to help in the best manner possible and Ill be doing so till the end of the 2011 World Cup, when my contract finishes.         
	What went wrong in Zimbabwe, your previous stop as coach?         
	(Grins) Everything went wrong... They (the Zimbabwe Cricket Union) didnt care... Anything I said or wrote made no sense to them... Youre seeing where Zimbabwe cricket has gone... Id spent three years and there was no point continuing... Frankly, I dont want to go down that road... I wasnt paid for the last nine months or so of my contract and Ive kept open the option of taking the Union to court... I wouldnt like to add anything which could have a bearing on possible legal action.         
	Inspiration as coach?         
	The late Bob Woolmer... He created a lot of things at Warwickshire and with South Africa, in particular, and was willing to let his players be themselves... He gave them the freedom to express... I liked that trait in Bob and, in my own way, have allowed the Ireland players to be just themselves.         
	How would you describe your style?         
	Dont know what the different styles are... I believe in hard work, for only if you work hard will you be successful... Im quite easy as a person, but Id like the players to be intense during training. Preparation is an important part of cricket and I dont compromise there.         
	Whats your biggest challenge as Irelands coach?         
	To get all players for all international commitments... Because quite a few are involved with Counties, they dont get released... Im pleased that the ICC is laying down guidelines to help Associates like Ireland...         
	The No.1 challenge for the players?         
	Its to keep believing that they can compete against the Test-playing nations... That belief will take them forward in a big way.         
	I suppose the players are itching for Test status...         
	Look, what we need is a place in the FTP specific to ODIs and T20 Internationals... Whats happening now is that we have to beg Test-playing nations to come and play the odd ODI or T20 in Ireland... That should change. Test status, I feel, is a long way off.         
	How closely do you follow West Indies cricket?         
	I do look at it from a distance and watch the occasional match in person... I dont try and get involved in any manner... The present state of West Indies cricket hurts... It really hurts former players like me... (After a pause) Of course, my nephew (Lendl Simmons) is playing and I follow his performances with interest.         
	Your take on whats wrong with cricket in the West Indies?         
	Wouldnt like to answer.         
	Where would your loyalties be if Ireland and the West Indies meet in the World T20 semis?         
	(Laughs) Id be fully Irish! I guess there could be mixed emotions, but Im doing a job with Ireland and my commitment cant waver.         
	In your opinion, which team stands the best chance?         
	Id go for Sri Lanka... The variation in their bowling is fantastic... Its going to be hard getting many off such an attack.         
	India?         
	Well, theyre the champions and all the players have played in the IPL and, so, are conversant with the demands of T20 cricket... Obviously, the Indian team is good.         
	Having been a coach for some years, what have you learnt the most?         
	That whatever you do, youve got to enjoy it... Enjoyment encourages better performances.         
	The final one: You had a lucky escape, after being felled by a bouncer in Bristol on the West Indies 1988 tour of England. What are your memories of that evening?         
	I remember everything... That the light had been fading and I hadnt been wearing a helmet... Those days, hardly anybody wore them... I needed (brain) surgery... Made me realise that one had to enjoy every day of ones life... That Id come so close (to death)...

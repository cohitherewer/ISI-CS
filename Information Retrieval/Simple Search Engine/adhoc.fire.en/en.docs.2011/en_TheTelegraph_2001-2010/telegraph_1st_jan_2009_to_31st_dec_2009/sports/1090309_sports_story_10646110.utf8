	London: Everton reached the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time since winning the competition in 1995 when they came from behind to beat Middlesbrough 2-1 in an exciting quarter-final on Sunday.         
	Earlier, Arsenal set up a quarter-final against Hull City when they cruised past Championship (second division) side Burnley 3-0 in a delayed fifth-round match at the Emirates Stadium.         
	Arsenal and Hull will meet on March 17 or 18 as they bid to join Chelsea, Manchester United and Everton in the last four. Chelsea won 2-0 at Coventry City on Saturday and Manchester United crushed Fulham 4-0 at Craven Cottage.         
	Everton battled back to beat Middlesbrough at Goodison Park with two goals early in the second half after David Wheater had headed Middlesbrough in front just before halftime. Wheater rose unchallenged to head in a cross from Matthew Bates and although Everton keeper Tim Howard got one hand to the ball and scooped it out of the net with the other, it had clearly crossed the line.         
	Evertons goals also came from headers with Marouanne Fellaini outjumping Robert Huth to loop the ball over stranded keeper Brad Jones after 50 minutes.         
	Substitute Louis Saha took advantage of slack Boro defending to add a second from Steven Pienaars cross seven minutes later. Arsenal avenged their League Cup defeat by Burnley in December with superb goals from Carlos Vela and Eduardo da Silva, captain for the day in only his second match of an injury-ravaged season.         
	Emmanuel Eboue, maligned by the home fans for some poor performances, wrapped up victory seven minutes from time, smashing in an unstoppable shot.         
	Burnley never looked like causing another upset.         
	Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said: When you score goals it always lifts the confidence and the belief and it is important for us to go to Roma with a feeling that we have done the job well. Vela opened the scoring after 25 minutes when he raced away from the Burnley defence after being played in by Andrei Arshavin and chipped the ball over keeper Brian Jensen.

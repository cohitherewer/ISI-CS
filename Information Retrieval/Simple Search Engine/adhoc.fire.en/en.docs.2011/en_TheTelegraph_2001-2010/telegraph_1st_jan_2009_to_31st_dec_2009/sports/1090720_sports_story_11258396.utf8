The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spinners peg back Windies
                                                   Spinners peg back Windies
                      
	St Georges (Grenada): Rain prompted an early lunch and stalled Bangladeshs progress, after their spinners, led by stand-in captain Shakib Al Hasan, bowled them back into contention. The visitors reduced the West Indies to 124 for five in their second innings in the second and final Test Sunday to get within touching distance of a first Test series victory, for which a draw in the second match will be enough.               
	At midnight, the West Indies were 173/7. David Bernard (47) and Ryan Austin (2) were at the crease               
	The Bangladesh spinners again exposed the frailty of the West Indies batting, and Shakib has so far captured three wickets for 40 runs from 15 overs, as the home team could only extend their lead to 129 on the third morning at the Queens Park Stadium Complex. But rain, about half an hour prior to the interval, set Bangladesh back in their efforts, after West Indies continued from their overnight total of 56 for one.         
	Shakib made the breakthrough in the eighth over of the morning, when left-handed opener Omar Phillips swung at a shortish delivery, and was caught at deep square leg for 29.         
	Four overs later, Shakib had Ryan Hinds caught at leg-slip for two.           (AFP)

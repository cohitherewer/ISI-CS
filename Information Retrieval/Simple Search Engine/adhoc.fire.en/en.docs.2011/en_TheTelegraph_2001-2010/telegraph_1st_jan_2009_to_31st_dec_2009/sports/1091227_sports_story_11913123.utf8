The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Alex cannot afford to slip
                                                                                                                       7                                      Alex cannot afford to slip
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Sir Alex Ferguson has intensified his criticism of Manchester City by insisting that Manchester United will always treat their manager with more respect than that shown to Mark Hughes by their city rivals.         
	The manager is always in a strong position at Manchester United and his position is always sacrosanct as far as the directors are concerned, he said.         
	Ferguson suffered an embarrassing defeat last time his side were in action, losing 0-3 at Fulham last weekend. That was their fifth defeat of the season in the league, one more than they suffered in the whole of the last campaign. They cannot afford another slip-up at Hull Sunday if they want to maintain pressure on Chelsea.         
	Hull have been wobbling at the back once again and Wayne Rooney is showing signs that he could go on one of his trademark scoring runs, with five goals in his last five matches after spell of just one goal in two months.

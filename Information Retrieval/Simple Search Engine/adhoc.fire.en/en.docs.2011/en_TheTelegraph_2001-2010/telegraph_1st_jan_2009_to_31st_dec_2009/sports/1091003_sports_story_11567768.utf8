                                                   Tiwary to fill in for De Villiers
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal batsman Manoj Tiwary has replaced South Africas AB de Villiers in the Delhi DareDevils squad for the Champions League Twenty20 tournament to be held from October 8-23.         
	De Villiers had reported back pain in the lead-up to the ICC Champions Trophy and has been advised rest for four to six weeks by the Cricket South Africa medical committee, a media release said Friday.         
	The absence of De Villiers has given a chance to the 23-year-old Tiwary, who is currently playing for Rest of India against Ranji Trophy champions Mumbai in the five-day Irani Cup tie.         
	The Bengal batsman, who made his ODI debut against Australia in February last year, has a good domestic T20 record, including 11 IPL appearances, with 374 runs at an average of 34.00 and strike rate of 119.87 from 17 matches.         
	The technical committee of CLT20 also confirmed that James Pattinson and Simon Keen have replaced injured players Damien Wright and Nathan Bracken respectively in the Victorian Bushrangers and NSW Blues squads.         
	Wright will miss the inaugural 12-team $6 million tournament due to a calf strain.         
	His replacement Pattinson, a 19-year-old all-rounder with one first-class match to his credit, was a member of the Australia squad that competed in the ICC Under-19 World Cup in 2008.         
	Left-arm pacer Bracken has been ruled out with a knee injury that will require surgery next week.         
	Young left-handed batsman Keen, who will replace Bracken, has played one domestic Twenty20 match for NSW.

                                                   Uthappa gets highest bid
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Bangalore: Karnatakas junior cricketers got a taste of IPL-style auction Friday, but not its huge sums, as eight teams of the Karnataka Premier League (KPL) picked their players for a Twenty20 tournament slated for next month.         
	Aimed at improving the standard of local cricket, teams vying for honours are Mysore Maharajas, Bangalore Brigaders, Bijapur Bulls, Malnad Gladiators, Davanagere Diamonds, Belgavi Panthers, Bangalore Provident Rural and Mangalore.         
	 The most expensive franchises were Bangalore Brigaders and Bangalore Provident, bought by two developers Brigade Enterprises Ltd and Mel Mont Constructions Pvt Ltd. for Rs 7.20 crore and Rs 5.55 crore, respectively, for a period of five years.         
	The highest bid was for Robin Uthappa at Rs 3.25 lakh by Bangalore Brigaders, followed by Stuart Binny, whom the Bijapur Bulls bought for Rs 3.20 lakh.         
	Uthappa was among the top-ten bids in the IPLs inaugural season in 2008, bought for $ 800,000 by the Mumbai Indians. The Mumbai team swapped him with Bangalore Royal Challengers Zaheer Khan ahead of the IPLs second season.         
	A total of 48 players were auctioned Friday, including former India players Sunil Joshi and David Johnson who were won for Rs 2.05 lakh and Rs 35,000 by Davanagere Diamonds and Belgavi Panthers, respectively.

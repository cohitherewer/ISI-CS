The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Somdev wins it for India
                                                     Somdev wins it for India
                  Somdev Dev Varman                     
	Kaohsiung: Somdev Dev Varman trounced world No.59 Lu Yen-Hsun 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 to script Indias 3-2 win over Chinese Taipei and help the team advance to the third and final round of the Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Group I competition here Sunday.         
	Starting as the underdog, Somdev capitalised on Lus umpteen unforced errors to win the first reverse singles and ensure victory for India.         
	In the second reverse singles match, which was a dead rubber, Rohan Bopanna lost 3-6, 7-6(8-6), 6-7(5-7) to Tsung-Hua Yang at the Yang-Ming tennis centre.         
	Contrary to expectations that the tie would go down to the fifth rubber, Somdev pulled off a brilliant victory against Lu, who has beaten the likes of David Nalbandian and former world No.1 Lleyton Hewitt this season, to seal the tie for India.         
	India will now play the winners of the other second round tie between Australia and Thailand to qualify for the World Group play-offs from May 8. It has been more than a decade that India played in the World Group; they figured in the elite group last in 1998.         
	India had lost 1-4 to Romania in the play-offs last year to get pushed back to the Asia/Oceania group I. India began the day with a 2-1 lead, which they had seized Saturday when Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi won the doubles rubber against Yang and Chu-Huan Yi.         
	Somdev had also won his first singles on the opening day of the tie on Friday, defeating Ti Chen but Bopanna lost the second singles to Lu. Lu let himself down Sunday with unending unforced errors as he allowed Somdev to escape from precarious situations.         
	The Taipei player set up the points beautifully, mostly by pinning Somdev to the baseline, but the winners deserted him.         
	To Somdevs credit, he kept hitting the ball and engaged Lu in long rallies, compelling him to commit mistakes. Lu saved two break points in the fourth game but Somdev hit a stunning double handed backhand winner to break Lu, creating a 3-1 lead.         
	A series of unforced errors by Lu proved costly for him in the sixth game as he handed Somdev a double break and a 5-1 lead.         
	The Indian served out the set in the next game to go one up.         
	Somdev played his heart out to neutralise an early threat in the second set as he saved two break points in the second game and held serve after playing out five deuces.         
	Mistakes at crucial moments by Lu continued to give Somdev the advantage and the Indian cashed in on those to get breaks in the fifth and seventh games to go 5-2 up and then served out the second set comfortably.         
	The third set was no different as unforced errors continued and Lu was broken in the very first game.         
	Somdev too sprayed some errors later on as he double faulted to drop his serve in the second game and squandered five break points in the third game.         
	However, Somdev capitalised on the second break point in the fifth game to take the lead yet again and saved three on his own serve in the next to make it 4-2.         
	Lu saved one break point in the seventh game to hold on, but that was just delaying the inevitable as he double faulted in the ninth game to hand the match to Somdev.         
	In the fifth rubber, Bopanna went down fighting against Yang, who defied a late challenge from the Indian to get a consolation win for his team.           (PTI)

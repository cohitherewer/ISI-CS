                                                     Chetri to join Dempo
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Sunil Chetri                           
	New Delhi: Sunil Chetri has decided to join Goas Dempo Sports for the coming season.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph on Sunday, Chetri, who played for East Bengal in the 2008-09 season said: My chances of playing for Dempo now is very high. Dempo are a very strong and balanced side and are known to be good paymasters. I am looking forward to play in Goa.         
	Chetri said he also had an offer from Salgaocar. I know Salgaocar are a good and reputed team and take a lot of care in building up their squad. But they have just been promoted to the I-League. It is not always fruitful to play for a new team.         
	Dempo coach Armando Colaco admitted that the star goalgetter was close to signing for his team. Since Chetri is coming, we may recruit only two foreigners. Apart from Chetri, we have Joaquim Abrahenches, who is playing very well.         
	Chetri is currently in the capital to take part in the Delhi Santosh Trophy trials under the son of the soil rule of the All India Football Federation (AIFF).         
	I wasnt training for one and half month due to the ankle injury I picked up against Mahindra United, Chetri said.

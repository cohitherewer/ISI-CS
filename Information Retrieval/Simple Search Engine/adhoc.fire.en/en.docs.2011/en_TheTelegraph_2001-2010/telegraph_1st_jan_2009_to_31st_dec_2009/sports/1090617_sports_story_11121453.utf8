	New York: Jeev Milkha Singh, who is battling a rib injury, will take a final call Wednesday whether to participate in the US Open starting Thursday at the Bethpage State Parks Black Course.         
	The Chandigarh golfer picked up the rib injury during the recent Celtic Manor Wales Open where he finished a commendable joint sixth.         
	Besides Jeev, Angelo Que of the Philippines and Korean trio of K.J. Choi, Bae Sang-moon and Charlie Wi are the other Asians in the elite event in New York.         
	It will be a walk down memory lane for Jeev, the reigning Asian Tour Order of Merit champion as he made his major debut at the US Open at the same venue back in 2002.         
	After missing the cut at the US Masters in April by one stroke, Jeev will be determined to regain fitness and compete in the US Open where world No.1 Tiger Woods is the title holder.         
	The world No.37 Indian has been in fine nick with two top-10 finishes in Europe recently and a fourth-place finish at the WGC-CA Championship in Doral, USA earlier this season.

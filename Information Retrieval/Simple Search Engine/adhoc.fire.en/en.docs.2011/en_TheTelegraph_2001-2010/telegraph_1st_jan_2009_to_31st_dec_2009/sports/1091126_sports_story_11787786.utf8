The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ODI door may stay shut
                                                                                                                       7                                      ODI door may stay shut
  - Despite Rahul Dravids superb run against Lanka...         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: Rahul Dravid hasnt given up hope, otherwise he wouldve announced retirement from ODIs, but the selectors dont appear inclined to reopen that chapter.         
	Not even after the recent 2-4 defeat at the hands of Australia and Dravids excellent run in the ongoing Test series, against Sri Lanka. Indeed, with scores of 177, 38 and 144, the former Team India captain is averaging a shade under a wowing 120.         
	As significant, Dravid has been positive throughout, almost as if wanting to prove a point or two to Krishnamachari Srikkanth and his colleagues.         
	Dravid, of course, chose to be politically correct when he was asked to comment after his classic 177 in the series first innings: Im not even thinking about that (sending a message to the selectors)... Im just trying to play every single game...         
	Srikkanth and Co. revived Dravids ODI career, in September, but dumped him after the tri-series in Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in South Africa.         
	It was a rather insensitive use-and-throw approach and, surely, the biggest names deserve to be treated better. Also, its not that Dravid had been a disaster in the two tournaments.         
	The selectors got the stick for both recalling Dravid, after almost two years, and dropping him without enough opportunities.         
	Clearly, criticism both ways has made the Srikkanths wary.         
	Everyone has seen the way Dravid is batting, but the selectors dont wish to go down that path again... As of now, theyd rather persist with younger players, more so as the 2011 World Cup is getting nearer, a well-placed source told The Telegraph on Wednesday, shortly after Dravids 28th Test hundred.         
	Dravid will soon be 37, but theres nothing to suggest he isnt fit. Age is an obsession in India, as a Sourav Ganguly would readily confirm, but the younger lot should be deserving of the India cap and must be worthy of getting an extended run.         
	Its worth noting, perhaps, that Team India had been reduced to 27 for five in the last ODI, in Guwahati, where conditions were challenging and the XI couldve done with the solidity of a Dravid.         
	Theres room, even in ODIs, for an innings-builder at No.3.         
	Once this (three-match) Test series gets over, the Lankans will stay on and feature in two T20 Internationals and five ODIs.         
	Dravid doesnt come into the T20 equation, but will probably have fingers crossed for the ODIs.

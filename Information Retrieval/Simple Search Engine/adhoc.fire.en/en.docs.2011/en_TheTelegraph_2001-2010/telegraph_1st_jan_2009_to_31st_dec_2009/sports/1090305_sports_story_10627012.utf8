	London: Chelsea narrowed Manchester Uniteds lead in the Premier League to four points on Tuesday with a 1-0 victory at Portsmouth while Liverpool also stayed in pursuit with a 2-0 defeat of Sunderland.         
	Chelsea were unimpressive in torrential rain at Fratton Park and the home side had two glorious opportunities to go ahead before Didier Drogbas fine finish settled the match.         
	Chelsea have 58 points from 28 games and are ahead of Liverpool on goal difference after David Ngog and Yossi Benayoun struck to give Rafa Benitezs side victory at home to Sunderland.         
	United have two games in hand on both, starting with their trip to struggling Newcastle United on Wednesday when they will be seeking to stretch their winning run in the league to 11.         
	Arsenal ended their recent goal famine when Nicklas Bendtner scored twice in a 3-1 victory at bottom club West Bromwich Albion which put them just three points behind Aston Villa in the race for a top-four spot.         
	Chelsea lived dangerously in the second half and twice Portsmouth went close to taking the lead. David Nugent was clear on goal but saw his shot well saved by Petr Cech and then a Portsmouth counter-attack led by Peter Crouch ended with Niko Kranjcar shooting narrowly wide. Drogba struck with a low shot from Jose Bosingwas cross 12 minutes from time to give Chelsea their fourth consecutive victory.         
	Liverpool went ahead against Sunderland when Steven Gerrard headed the ball across goal for Ngog to tap in. The home side doubled their lead when goalkeeper Marton Fulop made a meal of saving an overhead kick from Ngog and Benayoun tucked in the rebound.

	Southampton: Australia look well-placed to take a 3-0 lead over England in the one-day International series after restricting the hosts to 228 for nine wickets at The Rose Bowl on Wednesday.               
	At 12.30am Australia were 52 for two after 14 overs. The two batsmen out were Shane Watson (7) and Tim Paine (29). Michael Clarke (0) and Cameron White (14) were at the crease               
	England scored slowly for the third straight match after winning the toss and choosing to bat.         
	Ravi Bopara and Matthew Prior fell within the space of six balls to slow Englands uncharacteristically quick start and, although captain Andrew Strauss hit 63, the home side again failed to translate its Test success into limited-overs cricket.         
	Shane Watson took three for 36 as only a 40-run ninth-wicket partnership from Tim Bresnan and Ryan Sidebottom pushed the score past 200 to give Englands bowlers something to work with.         
	Eoin Morgan managed a relatively sprightly 43 but Paul Collingwoods 28 from 52 balls was more typical of the laboured approach that has so far brought 4-run and 39-run losses for England.         
	Having seen his team struggle in a run chase after he chose to bat second in the last two matches, Strauss opted to bat first this time.         
	England breezed to 40 from the first seven overs but their momentum was severely checked by the loss of Bopara and Prior.         
	Bopara holed out for 10 to a running catch at mid-off by James Hopes off the bowling of Nathan Bracken before Mitchell Johnson took the wicket of Prior with his fourth ball, Hopes again taking the catch.         
	Once Owais Shah had unluckily fallen leg-before-wicket to Johnson for eight, the main hope of a revival lay with Strauss and Collingwood but the former was tempted into a charge by Nathan Hauritz and hit straight to Michael Clarke at mid-wicket.         
	That left England on 98 for four and reliant on Collingwood.         
	He is in fourth place on Englands all-time scorers list in one-day internationals, but has struggled to score quickly recently and failed to get to grips with an in-swinging delivery from Watson, hitting it to Bracken at mid-on.         
	Morgan faced 57 balls before following Wright back to the pavilion, leaving Bresnan to rack up a quickfire 31 not out and Sidebottom 24 before falling to the last ball.           (AP)

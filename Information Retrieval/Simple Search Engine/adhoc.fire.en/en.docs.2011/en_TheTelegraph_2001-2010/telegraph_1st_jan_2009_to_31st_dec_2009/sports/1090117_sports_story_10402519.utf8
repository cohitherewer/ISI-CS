	Calcutta: Sri Lankan pacer Chaminda Vaas on Friday said he is still fit enough to play one-day Internationals even though the Lankan selectors think otherwise. The 34-year-old is in the city to play for Mohun Bagan in the J.C. Mukherjee Trophy.         
	Im always there you know. Im there in the Test team but Im available for one-day cricket also. Im fit enough for both. So I am looking to get back into the team, Vaas said after the quarter final at the Jadavpur Unitersity Salt Lake campus.         
	The selectors are of a different opinion They are trying to give the youngsters some exposure before the World Cup. Thats fair enough, Vaas said, explaining his omission from the ODI squad that is presently playing the triangular series in Bangladesh.         
	Talking about his experience after his first club match on Indian soil, Vaas said: Well this is the first time I am playing a club match in India.         
	Its a good feeling getting runs and bowling in the right areas I am so glad that I have contributed to the win.         
	Asked to describe himself, Vaas said: Generally, I am a fast bowler But in this level you got to bat as well. When you get older you have to get runs. So I am really enjoying batting. I like batting, be it at the international level or the domestic level.         
	Vaas looked impressed with teammates like Manoj Tiwary and Wriddhiman Saha.         
	There are good cricketers in both sides. My captain Manoj is a brilliant cricketer. I think he has a bright future.         
	There are a few other guys also. The wicketkeeper (Wriddhiman) who plays0 for Kolkata Knight Riders also has a bright future, he said.         
	Vaas also remarked that Zaheer Khan has matured during the England series and has become an indispensable member of Team India.         
	He has improved a lot during the England series. Hes bowling in good areas.         
	Vaas also hailed spinner Ajantha Mendis.         
	I think he has been bowling really well. He has played just a handful of Tests and has already taken more than thirty wickets Even in ODIs, he has already taken more than fifty wickets.         
	So its clear that he is bowling really well. He is improving continuously and I think he, too, has a great future, the pacer said.         
	In the match, Vaas emerged top-scorer with 38 runs in 23 balls which helped Bagan reach the target of 116 with four overs to spare.         
	After Bagan lost three quick wickets, Vaas and Safi Ahmed (13) saw their side through. Shayambazar pacer Sayan Sekhar Mondal claimed three wickets.         
	Earlier, while bowling, the Lankan bagged one wicket in his four overs, giving away 16 runs.         
	Bagan will face BNR in the semi-final while Kalighat will face Sporting Union in the other semi-final.         
	BRIEF SCORES: Shyambazar 115/7 (Debapriya Ghosh 26, Rakesh Krishnan 25, Chaminda Vaas 1/16). Mohun Bagan 116/4 (Chaminda Vaas 38 .., Safi Ahmed 13 ..) Mohun Bagan won by six wkts.

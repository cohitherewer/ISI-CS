The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jadeja is the dark horse
                                                     Jadeja is the dark horse
    - Tour of Lanka possibility of five medium-pacers not ruled out             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ravindra Jadeja                                 
	Calcutta: Saurashtra allrounder Ravindra Jadeja, who is in excellent form, has emerged the dark horse in the lead-up to Sunday afternoons Team India selection for the short tour of Sri Lanka.         
	The January 26-February 11 trip will see Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. play five ODIs and a one-off Twenty20 International.         
	Jadeja has grown in stature this season and impressed both with bat and ball Today, hes definitely the dark horse, a well-placed source told The Telegraph on Saturday evening.         
	Indeed, the gifted 20-year-old finished sixth (739 runs) among the leading run-getters in the just-ended Ranji Trophy.         
	In bowling, both Mumbai medium-pacer Dhawal Kulkarni and Jadeja (a left-arm spinner) finished with 42 wickets each, but the former returned a marginally better average  19.35 vis--vis 19.92.         
	Jadeja, one learns, could make it at Pragyan Ojhas expense.         
	The Hyderabad left-armer played only one Ranji match and though he was in the squad for the two-Test series against England, eyebrows had been raised over his sudden non-availability for the face-off versus Mumbai days before that meeting.         
	Is Ojha actually match-fit? Weeks later, that question is still doing the rounds.         
	Krishnamachari Srikkanth and his colleagues (Yashpal Sharma, Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave and Raja Venkat) may also look at a fifth medium-pacer as they dont want spearheads Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma to be played indiscriminately.         
	Clearly, a balance has to be struck and both need special care, particularly the more senior pro  Zaheer.         
	Zaheer, Ishant, Irfan Pathan and Munaf Patel are certainties If the captain (Mahendra Singh Dhoni) too is inclined towards another medium-pacer, then Virat Kohli could have to miss the tour, the source added.         
	Praveen Kumar and Lakshmipathy Balaji may emerge strong contenders. Praveen didnt have a great Ranji season, but has a good ODI record. The now-fit Balaji has, of course, made a superb comeback.         
	Its to be seen whether Dhoni pitches for UPs Rudra Pratap Singh, but he didnt play in the Ranji semis against Tamil Nadu and bowled no more than four overs in innings No.2 of the final versus Mumbai.         
	The selectors have been impressed with UPs teenaged medium-pacer Bhuvneswar Kumar, who got Sachin Tendulkar for a duck in the first innings of the final, but wont blood him immediately.         
	Ditto for the most successful bowler in the 2008-09 Ranji, Kulkarni, who is 20.         
	Bengals Ashok Dinda was well-placed in the early stages of the Ranji, but couldnt keep the momentum going. Gujarats Siddharth Trivedi has been fairly consistent, but lacks pace.         
	Seniority-wise, 13 select themselves: Sachin, Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma; Dhoni; Yusuf Pathan; Harbhajan Singh; Zaheer, Irfan, Munaf, Ishant.         
	Kohli or a fifth medium-pacer and either Ojha or Jadeja will complete the 15-strong line-up.         
	Ojha and Kohli were in the 15 when the selectors chose their last ODI squad (during the England series), almost two months ago.

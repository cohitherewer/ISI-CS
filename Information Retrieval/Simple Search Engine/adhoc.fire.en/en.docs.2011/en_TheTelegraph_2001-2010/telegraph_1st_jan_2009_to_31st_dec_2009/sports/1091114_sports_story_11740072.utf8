                                                                                                                                   PCB chief may be grilled
                      
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ijaz Butt is likely to be grilled by the governing council of the Board for replacing Younis Khan with Mohammed Yousuf as captain of the national cricket team without consulting anyone.         
	Council members Wazir Ali Khoja, who is tipped to take over as the chairman, and Muhammad Ali Shah claimed that Butt did not take the council into confidence while appointing Yousuf as captain for the Test tour of New Zealand.         
	Shah said the members would definitely ask the chairman to explain the whole situation and also why he did not inform them about what was happening there in Dubai.         
	Shah also said that Younis had done the right thing by stepping down.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Broad comes to Flintoffs defence
                                                   Broad comes to Flintoffs defence
            Nick Hoult                      
	Andrew Flintoff undergoes surgery on his knee injury on Monday as the furore over his Indian Premier League participation continues to dominate the build-up to Englands Ashes summer. Flintoff will miss the West Indies series, which begins at Lords next week, after tearing cartilage in his knee playing for the Chennai Super Kings.         
	His decision to play in the IPL, and it was Flintoffs choice, not that of the England and Wales Cricket Board, has been greeted with anger following yet another injury for a player who has spent too long on the sidelines.         
	But Flintoff has found support from within the England set-up although the irony is that it comes from a player who turned down the IPL riches in order to preserve his fitness for the Ashes.         
	How the ECB, who it was revealed on Sunday allowed Flintoff to play in his final IPL match despite carrying his knee injury, must have wished more England players followed Stuart Broads example.         
	But Broad, as a member of the England dressing room, is well aware how difficult it would have been to prevent a player from taking the IPL dollar. It is unfortunate he got injured and people talk about workloads but he would probably have bowled more overs if he had stayed here and played for Lancashire, Broad said.         
	Flintoff is perhaps a lesson for all young cricketers. Broad knows it is here and now, as a young man, that he has to work hard to avoid the pitfalls that have cost Flintoff so many Test caps. At 22, and a more natural athlete than Flintoff, Broad has coped well so far with the demands of an international career. But he has also helped himself. While Flintoff readily admits his early days were a diet of pizza and beer, Broad is representative of a new generation.         
	The workloads are huge now and that is what the ECB have spent a lot of time developing strength and conditioning coaches and doing a lot of work on that, he said. Ive found that the fitter I am from gym work and running work the easier it is for me to recover. That is easy coming from a 22-year-old but for the likes of Freddie when you get to 30 the workload is high and you are going to get injured. My view is if I can set a good fitness base I will recover quicker and my injuries will be fewer and far between.         
	I dont eat fast food, I have an occasional drink, but it is about building up good habits, he added. Im lucky because the information is there for my generation. Fred started in 1997 and I doubt if you had that kind of back-up then.         
	The IPL seems to have a knack for riling English cricket, whether it is injuring its star players or forcing envious administrators into the arms of Allen Stanford, which makes Broads old-fashioned world view sound like a refreshing change.         
	When I decided against the IPL I just did not want to do anything that would threaten playing in the Ashes, he said. Test cricket is the ultimate and playing in the Ashes is the pinnacle of that so I wanted to put all my energies into making sure that happened.

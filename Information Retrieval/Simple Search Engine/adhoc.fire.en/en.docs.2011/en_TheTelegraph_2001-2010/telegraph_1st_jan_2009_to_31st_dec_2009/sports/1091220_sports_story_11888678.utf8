The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Captain must be careful now
                                                                                                                       7                                      Captain must be careful now
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council Match Referee Jeff Crowe, on Saturday, imposed a two-match ban on Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, after his side was ruled to be three overs short of their target at the end of the Nagpur one-dayer when time allowances were taken into consideration.         
	Apart from Dhonis suspension, Crowe also fined the Indian players 40 per cent of their match fees.         
	In accordance with Article 2.5.2 of the new ICC Code of Conduct, which deals with serious over-rate offences, the captain receives two suspension points while the players are fined 10 per cent of their match fees for the first two overs short and 20 per cent for every additional over their side fails to bowl in the allotted time, the ICC said in a statement on Saturday.         
	The statement further read: Two suspension points in the enhanced code means a ban of one Test or two ODIs, depending whichever comes first for the player. As such, Dhoni has been banned for the next two ODIs to be played in Cuttack and Calcutta on December 21 and 24, respectively, while his players received 40 per cent fines.         
	Crowe reached the conclusion after a hearing, which was attended by Dhoni, India coach Gary Kirsten, on-field umpires Marais Erasmus and Shavir Tarapore, and third umpire Sanjay Hazare.         
	Speaking on his decision, Crowe said: The India captain, like his Sri Lanka counterpart, was reminded and warned before and during the ODI series to be mindful of the slow over-rates and the penalties under the revised code.         
	The India side was at par until the 42nd over but bowled only eight overs in the last hour which is unacceptable. I accept the fact that the ultimate desire of the India side was to win the match but at the same time it had deadlines to meet and also fulfill the responsibilities it owed to the stakeholders, Crowe added.         
	If Dhoni is found guilty of a second serious over-rate offence in an ODI over the next 12 months, he will receive a sanction of between two and eight suspension points as per the provisions of the new, enhanced ICC Code of Conduct, said the statement.         
	Gautam Gambhir, meanwhile, has been found not guilty for breaching the ICC Code during the Nagpur match.         
	In a hearing convened after the match on Friday evening, the left-hander pleaded not guilty to contravening Article 2.1.3 of the ICC Code for players and team officials which relates to showing dissent at an umpires decision by action or verbal abuse.         
	The incident took place in the fifth over of Indias innings when Gambhir was run-out by Angelo Mathews.         
	It was an unusual incident and while the umpires were justified in laying the charges, after studying all the evidences I found that Gambhir was actually annoyed and irritated by the actions of the bowler than at the decision of the third umpire. At the same time, the umpires and I were convinced that the actions of the bowler were unintentional, Crowe said.  
	what the icc code of conduct says  
	2.5 Minimum Over Rate Offences:  
	 Failure by a fielding team participating in an international match to meet the minimum over rate requirements contained in Appendix 2 constitutes an offence under this Code of Conduct by the relevant team captain and each of the players in that fielding team according to the following:  
	 2.5.1 Where the actual over rate in any Test match or any other international match of at least four days in duration is up to (and including) five overs short of the minimum over rate, or, in any one-day International match, Twenty20 International match or any other international match of fifty (50) or twenty (20) overs per side, up to (and including) two overs short of the minimum over rate, such an offence shall be considered a lsquo;minor over rate offence rsquo;.  
	 2.5.2 Where the actual over rate in any Test match or any other international match of at least four days in duration is more than five overs short of the minimum over rate, or, in any one-day International match, Twenty20 international match or any other international match of fifty (50) or twenty (20) overs per side, is more than two overs short of the Minimum Over Rate, such an offence shall be considered a lsquo;serious over rate offence rsquo;.  
	 Note: Subjective intent on behalf of the team captain to waste time is not required. It is sufficient to establish that the minimum over rate was not met. To avoid liability under this offence the team captain would need to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that the shortfall was due to factors beyond his control and that the time allowances permitted by the match officials in calculating the required over rate were not sufficient. The presence or absence of subjective intent and the extent of the shortfall shall be relevant in relation to the issue of penalty.

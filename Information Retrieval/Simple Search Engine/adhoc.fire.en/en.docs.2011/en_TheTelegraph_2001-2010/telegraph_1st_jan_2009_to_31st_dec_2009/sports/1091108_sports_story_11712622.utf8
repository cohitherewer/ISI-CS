The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Phil in lead; Jyoti tied at sixth spot
                                                                                                                                   Phil in lead; Jyoti tied at sixth spot
                                  Phil Mickelson      
	Shanghai: Jyoti Randhawa shunned aggression for caution and carded a second successive two-under 70 for a share of the sixth spot after the penultimate round of the WGC-HSBC Champions golf tournament here Saturday.         
	Randhawa, with a total of eight-under 208, will enter the final round six shots behind leader Phil Mickelson (67), who is chasing his fourth title of the year.         
	Randhawa acknowledged that he would need a special effort Sunday to upstage Mickelson and world No. 1 Tiger Woods (70), who is tied for the second spot at 12-under with Nick Watney.         
	Its not easy out there. Guys are trying to get aggressive and they make a few bogeys and suddenly youre out of the tournament, he said.         
	So I just played consistent golf, stuck to what I needed to do and made some putts, conceded the 2002 Asian Tour No. 1.         
	After opening with a couple of pars, the Delhi-pro stumbled to a bogey on the third hole before hitting back-to-back birdies on the fourth and fifth.         
	But a dropped shot on the sixth brought him back to square one before a birdie on the ninth hole helped him make the turn one-under.         
	His back-nine was a subdued affair and Randhawa found a birdie on the 16th hole for the second successive day to round off a steady day.         
	Among other Indians, Jeev Milkha Singh also carded a 70 to rise 13 places to tied 32nd with an overall total of one-under.         
	Further down, C. Muniyappa (78) and Gaganjeet Bhullar (76) continued to struggle and were tied for the 60th and 71st place respectively.         
	While Muniyappa has a total of five-over, Bhullar is 10-over overall.         
	Meanwhile, in the quiet of the clubhouse dining room, Mickelson could only imagine what it would be like Sunday, when he played in the final group with Woods for the first time in more than four years.         
	Smiling and raising his glass in a mock toast, he said: And hes got to give me one shot a side.         
	I know we are both looking forward to it, said Mickelson, who was at 14-under 202 in the final World Golf Championship of the year. I think it will be a fun day, and we are excited to be playing in the last group here in China.         
	It will be the first time the worlds top two players have been in the final group since the famous Duel at Doral in 2005, when Woods rallied from a two-shot deficit in the final round to win by one stroke.         
	Woods wasnt terribly pleased to be in this position. He took his first outright lead of the tournament with a 15-foot birdie putt on the eighth hole, and after another 15-foot birdie putt on the 10th, his lead was up to two.         
	That turned out to be his last birdie of the round, however. He missed one opportunity on the par-5 14th, badly missed on a 6-foot birdie putt on the 16th and finished his round by driving into the rough and hitting his approach into the bunker on the par-5 18th, having to save par for a 2-under 70.

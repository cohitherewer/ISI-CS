The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Captain Dhoni hurts finger
                                                                                                                       7                                      Captain Dhoni hurts finger
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Kanpur: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni hurt a finger on his right hand while keeping during Sri Lankas first innings on Day III. It couldnt be confirmed, however, whether it is the same finger that had troubled him on the eve of the second Test.         
	It happened in the post-lunch session when Zaheer Khan came round the wicket and bowled a slow bouncer to Prasa-nna Jayawardene. The ball bounced in front of Dhoni and he failed to gather it cleanly. The very next moment, Dhoni was seen removing the big gloves and appeared in considerable pain.         
	During the next few overs from Zaheer and Sreesanth, Dhoni failed to gather the ball most of the time and again popped out of his gloves.         
	Incidentally, on the eve of the match, Dinesh Karthik was flown in as cover due to a finger injury sustained by Dhoni in Ahmedabads first Test.

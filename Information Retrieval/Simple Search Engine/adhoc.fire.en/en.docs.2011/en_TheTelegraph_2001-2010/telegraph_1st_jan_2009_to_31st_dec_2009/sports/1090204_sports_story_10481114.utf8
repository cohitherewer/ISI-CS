            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Indian golfer Jeev Milkha Singh has been nominated for the Johnnie Walker Asian Player of the Year award.         
	The nomination follows a successful year for Jeev that saw him reach a career-high 35th in the international rankings and also become the first Asian player to surpass the $1 million mark in a single season.         
	The other golfers nominated in this category are Prayad Marksaeng and Thongchai Jaidee of Thailand, and Chinese-Taipeis Lin Wen-tang, according to a release.         
	The annual awards presented by the sponsor in association with the European, Asian and the Australasian Tours recognise the performances of professional golfers during the previous season.         
	American Anthony Kim earned nomination in the Young Player of the Year category along with Colombian Camilo Villegas, Martin Kaymer of Germany, Pablo Larrazabal of Spain, Northern Ireland golfer Rory McIlroy, and Australian Rick Kulacz.         
	The four contenders for the Asian Rising Star Award, presented to the young Asian professional who has shown the most promise, talent and commitment to the game of golf over the past 12 months, are Japans Ryo Ishikawa, Koreans Noh Seung-yul and Bae Sang-moon and Ben Leong of Malaysia.         
	The winners in the three categories, to be decided by vote by a panel of judges from the three Tours and the sponsor, will be announced on February 21 in Perth.

            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Mumbai: Kolkata Knight Riders principal owner Shah Rukh Khan has decided not to go back to South Africa unless his team starts winning.         
	The actor, who flew down to the city to cast his vote in the general elections, said that he will stay put in Mumbai as he doesnt want to be a part of the sadness which follows every defeat.         
	If they are doing well, I will go back otherwise, I dont like going back and feeling sad for the boys because there is a lot of talent in the team and a lot of hardwork, said a demoralised Shah Rukh.         
	The Telegraph had reported on Wednesday that Shah Rukh was returning home and his decision on going back to South Africa would depend on the Knight Riders performance in the next 10-12 days.         
	The Knight Riders have played fives matches so far, out of which, they have managed to win one. I feel very bad when we are not winning. I dont want to participate in that sadness with them, Shah Rukh said.         
	Shah Rukhs team have been dogged by controversies since the very beginning, be it the multiple-captaincy issue, or a clash with legend Sunil Gavaskar, or the tell-all blog written by an alleged player of the team.

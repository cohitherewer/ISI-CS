	Mumbai: Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown they say, but Churchill Brothers, it seems, will have none of that as the Goans start favourites to retain the I-League title when they take on Mahindra United in the season opener here Thursday.         
	The Goan club are first time defending champions and, in the pre-season, have annexed the IFA Shield and the Durand Cup titles.         
	The bad news though, for Churchill, is that Durga Boro has been ruled out of action for four months after going under the knife to treat a ligament injury.         
	Mahindra, who had problems with their finishing throughout last season, would take heart from the sparkling form of Mohammed Rafi who has scored six goals from five games so far, including a brace against East Bengal in the Durand Cup.

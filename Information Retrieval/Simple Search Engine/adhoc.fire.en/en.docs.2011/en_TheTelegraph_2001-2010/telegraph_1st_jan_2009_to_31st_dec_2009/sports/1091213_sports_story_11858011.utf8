The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sukhwinders boys ready for final fling
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sukhwinders boys ready for final fling
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Fresh from their surprise triumph over hosts Bangladesh in the semi-finals, the entire Indian team is brimming with confidence on the eve of the SAFF Cup final against the Maldives, in Dhaka on Sunday.         
	If things go according to plan, like it was in the semi-final, we should be able to wrap up the tie in 90 minutes, said coach Sukhwinder Singh, who is in charge of an under-23 team in the eight-nation campaign. Whatever we practised and planned during the two-week camp in Goa is finally producing results, he said.         
	Yet, winning the final against a team that beat India 2-0 in the group league would be a tough task. In the 2008 edition of the tournament in Colombo, India had sent a strong team under Bhaichung Bhutia, but succumbed to the Maldives in the final.         
	On Sunday, India will make one change from the team that played against Bangladesh. Striker Jeje Lalpeklua will make way for Balwant Singh, who missed the semi-final because of a red card.         
	The success of the Indians, goalkeeping coach Tanumoy Bose felt, is the triumph of the policy adapted by the chief national coach Bob Houghton.         
	It was Bob who suggested India should send their juniors for the SAFF Cup here. That was not taken kindly by many people, Bose said.         
	Bob wanted a strong second string side to play here. That way, this team has not only gained experience but has also thrown up some talented players.         
	Now, here we have some players like (D.) Ravanan, Robert (Lalthalma), Jewel Raja, Jeje and a few others, who would stake their claim for the senior team very soon. I am sure the under-19 team that is going for the SAF Games would also produce similar results, said the former India goalkeeper.         
	Buoyed by Indias good show, a host of All India Football Federation (AIFF) officials have reached Dhaka to watch the final.         
	While the general secretary, Alberto Colaco, has already been camping there for the past few days, two vice-presidents, Subroto Dutta and Ankur Dutta have rushed to Dhaka in anticipation of an Indian victory in the final.         
	The Indian team had a light practice session Saturday evening.         
	The boys have shown great spirit so far, said Sukhwinder. Never before have I seen India play with such dominance in the SAFF Cup.         
	The final will kick off at 5.30 pm IST. The match will be telecast live on ESPN.

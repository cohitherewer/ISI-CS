	Karachi: With Australia no longer the awe-inspiring side they used to be, former captain Ramiz Raja feels Pakistan have a golden opportunity to beat the world champions in their own backyard later his month.         
	In the past, our players went to Australia knowing they were playing against the best team in the world.         
	But now this mental block is not there in their minds and they have the potential to beat the Australians if they play consistent and positive cricket, Ramiz said.

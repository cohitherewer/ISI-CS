The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Diego: Every goal a stab on my chest
                                                   Diego: Every goal a stab on my chest
                      
	La Paz: Argentina suffered their worst defeat in World Cup qualifying when they wilted 6-1 against Bolivia at high altitude on Wednesday.         
	The result eclipsed the 5-0 defeat against Colombia in 1993 and ruined the early promise shown under coach Diego Maradona, who had earned three victories in three games with no goals conceded since he took over last November.         
	Maradona said he wanted to tell Argentines that I suffered with them, every Bolivia goal was a stab to the heart.         
	This is the first time (losing) has happened to me, he added. Hopefully this will be the only time.         
	The thrashing matched the two-time world champions worst World Cup result, a 6-1 hiding from Czechoslovakia at the 1958 tournament. Most of the Argentine squad  16 out of 23  had never played in the Bolivian capital 3,600 metres above sea level, and they arrived only two hours before kick-off.         
	The Bolivians matched their most goals against Argentina by halftime, when they led 3-1 at Hernando Siles Stadium. Joaquin Botero claimed a hattrick in the 33rd, 56th and 66th minutes.         
	Marcelo Martins opened the scoring for Bolivia in the 12th, and Luis Gonzalez equalised after 24 minutes. Brazilian-born Alex Da Rosa and Didi Torrico also scored for the home side.         
	In Porto Alegre, Luis Fabiano scored two first-half goals as Brazil moved into second place in the South American qualifying with a commanding 3-0 win over Peru.         
	Meanwhile, in Europe, defending champions Italy were held to a 1-1 draw by Ireland on Wednesday and European champions Spain and the Netherlands maintained their perfect records.         
	Robbie Keane scored from Caleb Folans header in the 89th minute to salvage a 1-1 draw for Ireland after Italy forward Giampaolo Pazzini was sent off in the third minute for elbowing John Shea while going up for a header, bloodying the Ireland defenders face.         
	Vincenzo Iaquinta had put Italy in front in the 10th, redirecting a pass that Fabio Grosso slid across the goal mouth. The draw put Ireland two points behind Italy at the top of Group 8.         
	Spain got a late goal from Albert Riera to beat Turkey 2-1 and Dirk Kuyt scored two to lead the Netherlands over Macedonia 4-0.         
	Germany maintained their four-point lead at the top of Group 4 with a 2-0 win at Wales, while Franck Ribery scored his second goal in five days against Lithuania to lead France to a 1-0 win in Group 7.         
	Spain trailed Turkey after Semih Senturk scored in the 26th, but Xabi Alonso equalised from the penalty spot in the 62nd after defender Ibrahim Uzulmez blocked the ball with his hand.         
	Riera benefited from a gap in the Turkish defence to score the winner in the second minute of injury time off a Daniel Guiza pass.         
	Also in Group 6, Belarus routed Kazakhstan 5-1 and Croatia beat Andorra 2-0. (AP)

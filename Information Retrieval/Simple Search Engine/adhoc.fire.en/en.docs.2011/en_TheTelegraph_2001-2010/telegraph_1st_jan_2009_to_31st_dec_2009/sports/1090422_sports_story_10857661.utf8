	 Sixes for charity
    Calcutta: The Deccan Chargers captain Adam Gilchrist will be aiming to hit 25 sixes in the ongoing Indian Premier League to help fund 25 modified bikes for children with disabilities. Each time Gilchrist sends the ball over the ropes, a child with disabilities will receive the gift of wheels with a modified bike through Amways Freedom Wheels programme, which Amway runs in partnership with the Technical Aid to the Disabled (TAD).         
	As a father of three kids, I know how much fun riding a bike can be for a child. Now, every six I hit means a smile on a childs face, Gilchrist said. I want to clear the boundary as often as I can, he added.               
	 IPL support
    Port Elizabeth: Indian Premier League (IPL) has donated Rand 100,000 to a high school here as part of the IPLs Help Educate and Teach initiative. He made the donation to 35 pupils and educators, including headmaster Dan Ngcape of the Ndzondelelo High School during the fifth IPL match between the Chennai Super Kings and the Royal Challengers Bangalore at the St Georges Park stadium in Port Elizabeth on Monday.         
	The second part of the programme will benefit individual learners attending IPL matches. Five learners will be identified at every match and their faces will be flashed on the stadium screens. Each of these will have Rand 15,000 paid into their school fees account in their names, he said.               
	 Image boost
    Johannesburg: The Indian Premier League (IPL) tournament is helping to burnish South Africas image abroad and dispel worries about its readiness to host the 2010 soccer World Cup, officials say.         
	The second edition of the IPL has brought a much-needed boost to South Africa, where flagging ticket sales for the Fifa Confederations Cup, which starts in June, had raised concerns over the countrys ability to host a successful soccer World Cup in 2010.         
	This was a perfect opportunity to show the world that we can host a major event in 20 days, said Gerald Majola, Cricket South Africa (CSA) chief executive.

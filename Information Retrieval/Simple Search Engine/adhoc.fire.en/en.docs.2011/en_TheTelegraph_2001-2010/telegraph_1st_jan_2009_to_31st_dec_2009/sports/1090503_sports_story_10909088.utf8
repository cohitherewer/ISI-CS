	Rome: Holder Novak Djokovic took advantage of Roger Federers slump after a rain break to win 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 on Saturday to set up a Rome Masters final against world number one Rafael Nadal. Nadal, a triple champion here, powered past Chilean 12th seed Fernando Gonzalez 6-3, 6-3 in the days second semi-final.         
	Indian challenge at the tournament ended Saturday. Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles seem to have found their nemesis in Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zemonjic. After losing to the Canadian-Serbian pairing in the doubles final at the Barcelona Open last week, they again lost to the second-seeded duo 4-6, 7-6(8-6), 8-10 in the semi-finals here. The Indo-Bahamian pair had enjoyed an easy outing against Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski on Friday winning 6-3, 6-4 against the Polish duo.         
	Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhys campaign too ended Friday when they lost 5-7, 3-6 to Bruno Soares and Kevin Ullyett in the quarter finals.         
	World number two Federer, yet to win a title this year, looked to be cruising when leading 6-4, 2-1 but rain then stopped play for about an hour.         
	The Swiss broke in the ninth game when Djokovic, whose concentration had been disturbed by a spectator whistling just as he was about to take his second serve, hit a forehand long. Federer went on to claim the first set before breaking the 21-year-old Serb again at the start of the second.         
	He had chances to go up 3-0 and 4-1 up on either side of the rain break before wild shots helped Djokovic force a third set.         
	The third seed then charged back from a break down in the decider. I feel this is not a match I should have given away because (I was a) break up in the second, break up in the third and I usually dont give away opportunities like this, said Federer after the match.         
	I was playing him well, serving well when I had to and putting him under pressure. The rain delay came at a perfect moment for him but he might have come back anyway and beat me.

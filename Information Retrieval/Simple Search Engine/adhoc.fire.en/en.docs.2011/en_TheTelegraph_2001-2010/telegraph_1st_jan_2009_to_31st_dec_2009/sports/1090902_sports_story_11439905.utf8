The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vijender top seed
                                                   Vijender top seed
                      
	New Delhi: Vijender Kumar continues to scale new heights and the Olympic bronze medallist was given top billing in the middleweight category while three Indians were also seeded in the World Boxing Championships starting in Milan, Italy Wednesday.         
	The 23-year-old Vijender, who was awarded the Khel Ratna last week, got a bye in the first round but has a tough bout at hand in the second round against a Kazakh pugilist.         
	Vijender was declared top seed at the draw ceremony Tuesday. It is amazing that Cuban boxer Emilio Correa, to whom Vijender lost in the Olympic semi-finals, has been seeded fifth, Indian coach Gurbax Singh Sandhu said.

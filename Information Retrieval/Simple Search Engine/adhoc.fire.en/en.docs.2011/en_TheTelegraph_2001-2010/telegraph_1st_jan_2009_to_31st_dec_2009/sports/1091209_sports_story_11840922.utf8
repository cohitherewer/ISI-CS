The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB gets dues
                                                                                                                       7                                      CAB gets dues
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Indian Premier League chairman Lalit Modi on Tuesday handed over a cheque of Rs 33 lakh to Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Jagmohan Dalmiya. The amount had been spent by the CAB in preparations for IPL-II before the tournament was shifted to South Africa.         
	Modi along with KKR co-owner Jay Mehta inspected the ongoing renovation at Eden Gardens and seemed pretty satisfied with the work in progress. I was shown the lay-outs of the new look Eden and it was awesome. I can understand that the capacity of the stadium will reduce after the renovation but that is a sacrifice we have got to make.         
	For a staging association as well as for franchises, the spectators comfort and safety are of paramount importance. We should all ensure that the experience of watching a match should be hassle free, Modi said.         
	He however brushed aside rumours that CAB would be deprived of their quota of 20 percent tickets due to curtailment of seats.

                                                   Take a break: Border to Johnson
            CRICKET BRIEFS                
	 Melbourne: Former Australian captain Allan Border on Tuesday advised struggling pacer Mitchell Johnson to take a break from international cricket for a week to recapture his rhythm.         
	Its not going to hurt Mitch to stand down for a week, go back in the nets, and thunder in for the equivalent of up to 15 overs a day until he gets it right, Border said.         
	Meanwhile, former Australian left-arm pacer Tony Dell was of the view that Johnsons problem can be solved easily. He has a lot of pace and a beautiful run-in but he stuffs things up at the point of delivery, Dell said. It should not be rocket science to teach a left-armer to bowl an inswinger.         
	Gaddafi No.2         
	Mumbai: The D.Y. Patil Stadium in Nerul, Navi Mumbai, has been adjudged the sixth best cricket stadium in the world by the Architects Journal of Britain. The journal judged the cricket architecture of various grounds in the world as the famous Lords in London got the top honour while the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore was adjudged the second best.         
	The other three grounds that got better rankings than the Mumbai stadium, which hosted the final of the inaugural edition of Indian Premier League (IPL) last year, were the Newlands in Cape Town (South Africa), the Kensington Oval in Barbados and the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Australia.         
	CSA meeting         
	Durban: The Cricket South Africa (CSA) has convened an urgent meeting of its board of directors on Thursday in an attempt to resolve the dispute with one of its affiliates, the Gauteng Cricket Board (GCB).         
	This follows CSAs recent decision to strip the Wanderers in Johannesburg, which the GCB controls, of all international matches until the GCB apologises for its criticism of the IPLs organisation earlier this year. The GCB was especially critical of CSA CEO Gerald Majola and IPL chief Lalit Modi.         
	Curator view         
	London: Edgbaston curator Steve Rouse said that the pitch for the third Ashes Test would be a paradise for the pace bowlers and Australia would not need services of spinner Nathan Hauritz. With the conditions like this, Nathan Hauritz could be a waste. Australia should play four seamers I would think, he said.

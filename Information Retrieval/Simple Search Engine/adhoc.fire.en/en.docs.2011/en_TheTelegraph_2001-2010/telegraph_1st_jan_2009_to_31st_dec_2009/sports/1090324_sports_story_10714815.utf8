The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan stay in hunt 
                                                   Bagan stay in hunt 
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The winner in a football match is the team that has scored more goals, which is not necessarily always the best team. Similar was the case on Monday at the Barasat Stadium where Mohun Bagan registered a 2-1 win over United SC, a match that was crucial for both the teams, but for different reasons.         
	The victory kept Bagans hopes of claiming the I-league title alive as they moved to 36 points from 18 matches  six points behind current leaders Churchill Brothers, who have played two matches more. United SC, on the other hand, remain at 11th on the league table with 21 points.         
	United SCs Snehasish Chakraborty muffed the first scoring opportunity in the 8th minute when he failed to connect a low cross from Gouranga Dutta.         
	Bagan, in a desperate attempt to score, had pushed most of their players upfront. Brazilian Marcos was a livewire on the field, chasing down the remotest of balls and orchestrating the midfield with his deft passes.         
	But United SC coach Subrata Bhattacharya seemed to have done his homework well as his players denied any space to the Bagan midfield with two-three players always attacking the opponent player who had the ball.         
	On the other hand, United, who in the absence of the impressive Murithala Ali (out with a double booking) were playing with a lone striker in Sankar Oraon, looked quite menacing in their counter attacks.         
	Hardeep Singh got his timing wrong in the 40th minute when a potentially dangerous cross from Gouranga went a begging. Also baffling was the lack of wing-play from Bagan players, whose futile efforts to stitch together ground passes undermined their game.         
	One would like to believe that aerial balls would have benefited the green and maroon brigade, more so because Uniteds tall defender, Daniel was not playing.         
	Mohun Bagan took the lead against the run of play at the stroke of halftime, when a feeble header from Bhaichung off a corner from Marcos, went in as United SCs Arnab Mondal tried to clear the ball.         
	Though it looked like an own-goal, the referee, it was later learnt, had awarded it to the India captain. The second half presented a similar picture with the so-called minnows giving the city giants a tough fight. Uniteds efforts were aptly rewarded when Snehasish made up for his early mistake to unleash an angular shot that drew United level.         
	But Bhaichung restored Bagans one goal lead in the very next minute with a superb header off a Marcos free-kick.

	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting Thursday take on Mohammedan AC in a Calcutta Football League premier division match at their home ground.         
	Confident ahead of the encounter, Sporting coach Shabbir Ali said: We have two wins from two matches. Although our first match was good, we didnt play very well in the second. So, we are looking forward to the tie.         
	Under-19 player Bapi Chowdhury, a Sporting regular, will not be available for the tie as he is running a temperature. Lucky Imran will take his place in the midfield.         
	The strike pair of Theodore Sunday and Eduardo will start with Dipendu Biswas likely to come in later.         
	Meanwhile, Mohammedan AC coach Pronob Chakraborty said he would be playing for full points.         
	We know that Sporting have good strikers but we will be playing for a win, he said.

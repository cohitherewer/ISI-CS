	Mumbai/ Pune: Churchill Brothers rediscovered their winning habit as they edged Air India 3-2 in an I-League match, here on Sunday.         
	Ogba Kalu starred for the defending champions with a brace and the prolific Okolie Odafe was back with his typical poaching skills as he scored the winner five minutes from time.         
	Dada Nabeel drew the first blood for the hosts with a header from a set-piece in the fourth minute.         
	The visitors got the equaliser in the 31st minute when Felix rose to meet a floater from Naoba Singh but failed to make contact. The ball landed at Kalus feet in front of the net and the Nigerian made no mistake in driving it home.         
	Churchill could have scored another within four minutes if not for an alert Arnab Das Sharma who blocked an Odafe shot inside the six yard box. But Sharma could get only a touch at Kalus full blooded shot, set up by Odafes deft touch, in the 37th minute.         
	Air India drew level just before the break through ND Opara who slotted home comfortably a crisp pass by Ravinder Singh.         
	After a lengthy period of lull, the match came back to life in the 83rd minute. Churchills goalkeeper Lalit Thapa failed to hold on to the ball coming off a corner kick and the ball bounced into the net. But referee Bikramjit ruled that the goalie was pushed and so the goal did not stand.         
	After the injury came the insult when Odafe combined with Japanese Dan Ito to find the winner for the reigning champions.         
	 In Pune Dempo and Pune FC played a 1-1 draw. The home team went ahead when Arata Izumi scored in the 85th minute but Anthony Pereira scored the equaliser a minute before full time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shearers chance to play saviour
                                                     Shearers chance to play saviour
                  Shearer                       
	London: Alan Shearer makes his managerial debut for Newcastle on Saturday against Chelsea with the opportunity to prove that his inexperience is not a barrier to keeping the club in the Premier League.         
	The 38-year-old former England captain took charge two days ago and must become just the fourth coach this season to find a way to beat the Blues away from home or Newcastle will stay in the relegation zone with seven matches remaining.         
	Crowds and morale had been dwindling as Newcastle slipped into the bottom three of the standings under temporary manager Chris Hughton, but the return of the northeast England clubs record goalscorer means a sold-out 52,000 crowd will be roaring in support of their team on Saturday.         
	Chelseas 32 points on the road make them the strongest away side in the Premier League, but even their lauded players are wary of the effect Shearer could have upon the players and fans who are in absolute awe of the former England striker for his scoring feats and dedication to his hometown club.         
	You can imagine what the atmosphere is going to be like, midfielder Frank Lampard said. Alan Shearer is regarded as a god up there and quite rightly so after what he achieved for the club.         
	He will definitely get the Newcastle fans going and he will get the Newcastle players going.         
	Getting the players going is just what another former Newcastle legend, Kevin Keegan, struggled to do already this season.         
	Having returned for a second spell in charge of a club where he shone as a player for two years in the 1980s, Keegan had managed to coax positive signs from his players but little more before he left the side in September because of a disagreement with the board over transfer policy.         
	That was just the first of several upheavals that Shearer must now contend with.         
	Keegans replacement, Joe Kinnear, lasted just four months before needing heart surgery and Hughton then seemed to show why he has spent his coaching career as an assistant rather than the man in charge.         
	Like Keegan last season, Shearer will rely on a fit Michael Owen to lead a surge to safety.         
	The striker has not played 90 minutes since January 17 because of an ankle injury but is set to start Saturday and Shearer would like a repeat of the seven goals he scored in the last 10 games to help keep Newcastle up a year ago.         
	It remains to be seen whether Shearer will deploy Owen, his successor as Newcastle captain, in the deep-lying role that Keegan found for him.         
	But while Newcastle are trying to stay in the league, Chelsea are still trying to win it.         
	The Blues lost 1-0 at Tottenham in their last match, but that was just their first loss since Guus Hiddink arrived as manager in February.         
	The title race is still not over for us, Chelsea captain John Terry said. Alan Shearer is Newcastle through and through and him taking over as the manager is going to give them a massive lift.         
	Chelsea need to win to stay in touch with Manchester United and Liverpool.         
	Liverpool are three points ahead of Chelsea on 64 ahead of their game at Fulham on Saturday, while defending champions Manchester United lead the league with 65 and a game in hand even before Sundays visit of Aston Villa.         
	Liverpool are the form team after big wins over Real Madrid, United and Villa and the Merseysiders got another big boost Friday when captain Steven Gerrard followed manager Rafa Benitez in agreeing a contract extension.         
	That soaring morale could be crucial against the side that reignited the title race two weeks ago with a shock 2-0 win over Manchester United.         
	Also Saturday, Arsenal host Manchester City, Bolton host Middlesbrough, Hull host Portsmouth, West Bromwich Albion host relegation rival Stoke, West Ham host Sunderland and Blackburn host Tottenham Hotspur seeking the victory that will keep them above Newcastle regardless of what the Magpies do against Chelsea.

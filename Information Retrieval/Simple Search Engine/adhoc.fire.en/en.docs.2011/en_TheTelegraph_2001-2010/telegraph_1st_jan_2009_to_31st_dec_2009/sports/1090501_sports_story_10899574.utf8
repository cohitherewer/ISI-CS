The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Strauss blames it on IPL
                                                   Strauss blames it on IPL
                      
	London: England skipper Andrew Strauss has blamed the Indian Premier League (IPL) for hurting his countrys chances in the forthcoming Test series against the West Indies following Andrew Flintoffs injury while turning out for the Chennai Super Kings.         
	Flintoff underwent a key hole surgery on his knee after hurting himself during an IPL match. Though the England cricket board expects the all-rounder to be back for the World Twenty20 tournament, he has been ruled out of the two-Test series against the West Indies starting May 6.         
	I will be trying to catch up with Fred over the next week or two, said Strauss.         
	The IPL is a tricky situation and no one thinks its ideal. We always play a home Test series at this time of year, so it affects us more than most other sides, the England captain said.

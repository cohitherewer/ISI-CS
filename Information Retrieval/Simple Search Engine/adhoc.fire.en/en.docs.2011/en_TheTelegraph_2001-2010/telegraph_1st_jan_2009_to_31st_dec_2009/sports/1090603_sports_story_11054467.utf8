	Paris: A minutes silence was observed at the French Open on Tuesday for the passengers on the Air France plane that disappeared over the Atlantic Ocean.         
	Russian world No.1 Dinara Safina and Belarussian Victoria Azarenka were among those on Philippe Chatrier Court who stood with their heads bowed to observe silence before their quarter final match at Roland Garros.         
	The flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris went missing on Monday with 228 people on board. More than 24 hours later, the chances of finding survivors appeared close to nil and authorities were treating the passenger list as a death toll.

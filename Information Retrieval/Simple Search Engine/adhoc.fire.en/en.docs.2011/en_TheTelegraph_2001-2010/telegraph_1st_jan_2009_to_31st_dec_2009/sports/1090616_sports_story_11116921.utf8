	London: Pakistan romped into the semi-finals of the World Twenty20 after thrashing Ireland by 39 runs in their must-win last Super eight match here on Monday riding on Kamran Akmals sparkling half century.         
	With this win, Pakistan, who avenged their humiliating debacle at the hands of the Ireland in the 2007 ODI World Cup in Caribbean, joined South Africa in the last four stage.         
	Akmal smashed 57 off 51 balls with his partners frequently changing at the other end to propel Pakistan to 159 for five in their stipulated 20 overs after skipper Younis Khan elected to bat at the Oval.         
	But Irelands chase was cut short by the fiery Pakistan bowlers Saeed Ajmal and Umar Gul at 120 for nine, despite a brave 36-ball 40 from their captain Williams Portersfield on a windy evening.         
	Following their impressive feats against Ireland, Gul and Ajmal also became the top two bowlers of the tournament with 12 and 11 wickets respectively in their kitty.         
	Portersfield, who opened the run-chase, with wicketkeeper-batsman Niall brien (7), appeared helpless in the absence of a stable partner. He, however, stitched a 45-run partnership with Kevin brien (26) through six overs before leaving the field in the 13th over.         
	Although promising 18-year-old Paul Stirling, at number three, also tried his best to steady the innings as he hit two fours in his 16-ball 17-run knock during his brief stay at the crease.         
	Earlier, Pakistan got off to a steady start with Akmal and the opener Shahzaib Hasan (23) adding 38 runs in 5.4 overs. But Ireland pacer Alex Cusak, who returned 4 for 18 in last match against Sri Lanka, soon removed Shahzaib by getting him caught by Kyle McCallan at mid-off.         
	Boyd Rankin did his best to keep the Pakistan batsmen in check by conceding only seven run in his spell of three overs.         
	Next batsman in, Shahid Afridi made useful contribution of 24 runs before he fell off a McCallan delivery which the all rounder sent to long on in a bid to hit a boundary but it flew a bit lower and was easily grabbed by John Mooney.

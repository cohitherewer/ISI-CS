The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ryder plays down spat
                                                   Ryder plays down spat
                      
	Auckland: New Zealands Jesse Ryder was in the thick of things in the final one-day International on Saturday. He ripped through the Indian middle-order, hammered the Indian bowlers and to make an already memorable day more eventful, got involved in a spat with pacer Ishant Sharma.         
	Ryder, however, played down the spat. Something was said and I just got a little bit heated. We shook hands and apologised to each other, said the explosive batsman.         
	Ryders whirlwind 63 with the bat and his three-wicket haul for 29 snapped Indias winning streak as New Zealand cruised to an eight-wicket consolation win.         
	Indias awe-inspiring batting order witnessed a rare collapse as the visitors were skittled out for a paltry 149 in 36.3 overs. The score could have been an embarrassing one but for Virender Sehwag (40) and Rohit Sharma (43 not out).         
	New Zealand chased down the target in just 23.2 overs after Ryder gave them a flying start.         
	 Guptill (57 ..) stayed in the middle till the end to see the side through in what turned out to be a one-sided contest at the Eden Park.         
	The Indians, who had already clinched the series, had to be content with a 3-1 scoreline with the Black Caps restoring some pride by convincingly winning the last game.         
	The teams would renew their rivalry in a three-match Test series starting March 18.         
	The victory, however, was marred by an ugly spat between Ryder and Ishant. The Delhi pacer triggered it when the robust New Zealander smashed him into the stands. His pride hurt, Ishant walked up to the batsman and muttered something. The left-hander responded with another six over mid-wicket, which incensed the fast bowler further. There was another exchange of words and umpire Rudi Koertzen warned Ishant for his on-field misconduct.         
	Ryder was to rub it in when he hoisted the speedster deep into the stands over long-leg, bringing up his half-century with a disdainful pull.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Captaincy is a burden: Yuvi
                                                   Captaincy is a burden: Yuvi
                      
	Bloemfontein: Kings XI Punjab captain Yuvraj Singh was in a relaxed mood after his sides victory over the Delhi DareDevils but that did not stop him from confessing that captaincy has brought the worst out in him as he gets angry easily when his team is not doing well.         
	Well, actually it is getting the worst out in me. I am getting very angry on the field, I dont know why, Yuvraj said after his side beat Delhi DareDevils by six wickets to keep their semi-final hopes alive on Friday.         
	But hopefully ... as long as we are winning, it doesnt matter what it brings out in the captain, so I am happy, he added.         
	Yuvraj though could not hide his glee when asked about the red-hot form of Brett Lee whose three for 15 set up the match for Kings XI against the DareDevils.         
	Lee made a (big difference). Since he came in, we have got better in the bowling department. He obviously brings in a lot of pace and enthusiasm.         
	He has been helping Irfan Pathan and Sreesanth out too, thats very important. So I am glad he is here, the left-hander said.         
	Yuvraj was also happy that temperamental pacer Sreesanth also came good against the DareDevils after his rather forgettable show against the Deccan Chargers.         
	He (Sreesanth) is coming back from an injury. He has had ups and downs but I thought he bowled really well.         
	He bowled at his best and is getting better at the end of the day.         
	So hopefully, he will do better in the coming games for us.

	According to Younis that Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ejaz Butt going to India to meet Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) officials was a good sign.         
	I hope he (Butt) returns home after having positive negotiations with the Indian board officials and there is some progress towards restoring bilateral cricket ties with India, he said.         
	Cricket has always served to reduce differences between the people of the two countries, Younis added.

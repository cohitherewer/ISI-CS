                                                   Pak to play Aussies in UAE
                      
	Karachi: With the Australian government not clearing the cricket teams tour of Pakistan on security grounds, the five-match ODI series would now take place in the United Arab Emirates.         
	Pakistans state-owned wire service quoted Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ejaz Butt as saying that the series scheduled in April-May this year was on but would be held in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.         
	Cricket Australia is still very keen to tour Pakistan but they are not getting clearance from their government because of security reasons, Butt said.         
	He said he had a very fruitful meeting with the Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland.

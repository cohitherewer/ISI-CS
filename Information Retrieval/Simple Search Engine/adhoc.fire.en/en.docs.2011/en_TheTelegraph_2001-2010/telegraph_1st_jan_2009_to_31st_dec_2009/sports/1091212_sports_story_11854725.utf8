The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians ride Sushil strike to the final
                                                                                                                       7                                        Indians ride Sushil strike to the final
  - Sukhwinder Singhs boys to take on the Maldives in summit clash on Sunday       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Sushil Kumar                                 
	New Delhi: Skipper Sushil Kumar Singh struck off a free-kick in the 62nd minute as the India under-23 team pulled off a surprise 1-0 win over hosts Bangladesh to reach the final of the SAFF Cup in Dhaka on Friday.         
	Described as clear underdogs before the crucial semi-final, the Indians dominated the proceedings throughout the match to stun the local favourites in front of a capacity crowd at the Bangabandhu Stadium to set up a title clash with the Maldives on Sunday.         
	In the other semi-final, defending champions Maldives proved too good for Sri Lanka and won 5-1.         
	Our plan was to go out and attack from the beginning, said Sukhwinder Singh, who was also the coach when India won the SAFF title in Goa in 1999.         
	The aim was to overcome the crowd support that the host team was receiving from the start. We were successful in doing that, he added.         
	Apart from Sushil, no other player in the Indian team had ever earned the national colours before this tournament but they took a firm grip over the match and could have scored at least three goals in the first half itself.         
	Twice in the first session, defender Robert Lalthalma came up with lethal free-kicks but Bangladesh goalkeeper Aminul Haq made brilliant saves to rescue the hosts.         
	Haq, however, had little to do when India, 15 minutes into the second session, earned a free-kick 10 yards outside the box. Robert, who took the kick, passed the ball for Sushil, whose low but accurate shot banged against the net.         
	Watched by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) president Hammam and the All India Football Federation general secretary Alberto Colaco from the VIP box, India then launched a series of attacks that totally upset Bangladeshs plans.         
	Never for a moment India looked a team that was playing without three of their first eleven players. Going by the trend of the match, the visitors could have won by at least four goals.         
	It was one of those days when all our plans were smoothly executed, admitted Sukhwinder.         
	The boys did whatever they were told. I told them not to allow Bangladesh any space and time. They did it wonderfully.         
	Here in Dhaka, I am frequently asked why we have come with a junior side, said Sukhwinder. All I told them was that these boys were capable of doing well in this tournament. I hope today (Friday) they were finally convinced, said the coach.         
	The last time India won the SAFF Cup, the symbol of regional supremacy in soccer, was in December 2005 in Karachi under Syed Nayeemuddin, who was shown the door by the AIFF three months after the triumph.         
	In 2008, India, led by Bhaichung Bhutia, surrendered the title to the Maldives in the final played in Colombo.

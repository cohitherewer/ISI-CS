The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mixed day for Jwala
                                                     Mixed day for Jwala
            JAYDEEP BASU            Jwala Gutta                           
	Hyderabad: Jwala Gutta and Diju Valiyaveetil kept the Indian flag flying in the $120,000 Indian Open when they reached the final of the mixed doubles at the Gaichibowli Indoor Stadium here Saturday.         
	It was exactly 90 minutes after Jwala and Shruti Kurian suffered a humiliating defeat in the womens doubles semi-finals that Diju and Jwala dished out an impressive display to win 21-11, 21-12 against the Malaysian pair of Jien Guo Ong and Sook Chin Chong.         
	Following the defeat in the womens doubles, Jwala and Shruti hinted they might not play together in the future.         
	In the mixed doubles final Sunday, the Indian duo will cross swords with Flandy Limpele and Vita Marissa of Indonesia.         
	We are confident of winning the title although weve never played this doubles team before, Diju said after the match. Frankly, we are going into the match with a 50-50 chance.         
	Never for a moment had the Indian pair looked like losing grip over the semi-final encounter.         
	In both games they took an early lead and maintained it comfortably. The Malaysian pair looked rattled and committed a series of unforced errors to make matters easy for the Indians.         
	We were in an attacking mood from the very beginning and never retreated into our shells, said Jwala. We never had to defend and could combine well.         
	Things were not as rosy for Jwala and Shruti in the womens doubles semi-final against Vita Marisa and Nadya Melati of Indonesia.         
	Reports said that the two Indian girls had not been on talking terms for several days and would part ways as a doubles pair after this match.         
	While the reason behind the split remained a matter of speculation, it was quite evident that one of Indias most celebrated doubles pairs was in no mood to extend a relationship that started more than 10 years ago.         
	The lack of combination between the two was so evident even the spectators could feel it.         
	They hardly talked to each other during the 24-minute match except on a few occasions when Jwala looked unhappy over conceding a point.         
	They put up a semblance of a fight in the first game but totally gave up in the second.         
	Asked about their future plans, after the match, Jwala said an announcement would be coming soon.         
	We will discuss things and take a decision very soon. You will get to know about it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhutia takes Bagan atop
                                                     Bhutia takes Bagan atop
            A STAFF REPORTER            Jose Ramirez Barreto congratulates Bhaichung Bhutia after the victory on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Great players grow old but never lose their appetite. Bhaichung Bhutias never-ending appetite for goals gave Mohun Bagan a record ninth I-League win on the trot Friday, making them the league leaders as they beat Sporting Clube de Goa 1-0.         
	This was a crunch match for Bagan. They came into it on the back of eight victories and were just a point behind leaders Sporting. As Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa rightly pointed out after the match, this victory has made them the masters of their own destiny. They will not need to hope Sporting lose to others so that the Goans can be overtaken.         
	Bhaichung was denied by the goalpost and the crossbar once each on either side of the break. But he fought to score as if a goal was his birthright and found the net in the 76th minute.         
	Substitute Lalkamal Bhowmicks corner from the left flank was headed down by Marcos Pereira inside the Sporting box and Barreto tried a bicycle volley. He could not connect properly and the ball fell to Bhaichung. He not only had his back to the goal but also had three defenders around him. But he knew exactly where the goal was and only needed a half-turn to shoot it in with the left foot.         
	Bhaichung deserved to score much earlier. He headed in a James Singh cross in the 44th minute when it hit the post and on its way out, hit Sporting custodian Felix DSouzas shoulder. TV replays suggested DSouza was standing inside the goal at that moment which would make it a valid goal. To be fair to the referee, it happened so quickly that even the Bagan players did not appeal for the goal.         
	A minute before the strike, Bhaichungs header hit the crossbar. When he headed the rebound, it was cleared by a Sporting defender.

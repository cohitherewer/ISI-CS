The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Loss to Pakistan was our undoing: Dhoni
                                                   Loss to Pakistan was our undoing: Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT                            
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Wednesday said that losing to Pakistan in the opening match proved to be crucial in the exit from the Champions Trophy.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Dhoni: We could have won the first game but didnt. Losing to Pakistan in the first game proved to be crucial. We could have won but for a few errors Starting off well and getting into the groove is important Such is the format. You can practice hard and all but you have to get into the mood in the games. Praveen Kumar started brilliantly today and Ashish Nehra has been the pick of our bowlers. Bhajji and Amit Mishra did well. We came back well against Australia It was swinging a bit so I thought why not give myself a bowl? We didnt commit many mistakes today and the performance was up to the mark. We exploited the conditions well Itll be a nice break before the Australia series, so well prepare for it.         
	Virat Kohli (MoM): I am hitting the ball well for the past few months and I was confident of going out and scoring runs. If you score runs at a good level it gives you confidence and urges you to do well in the future. I have learnt to be more patient at the crease and its paying off. It was a good track but it was doing a bit, Roach was bowling quick. It was tough work but I enjoyed it out there.         
	Reifer: We didnt get enough runs. The teams lost a lot of wickets in the first 15-20 overs and that did us in. Our batting is inexperienced and we have to work on that. We bowled and fielded well. We have a lot of positives to take back home.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiwary, Saha likely to get a look in 
                                                   CRICKET BRIEFS 
                      
	 Tiwary, Saha likely to get a look in     
	Calcutta: Wicketkeeperbatsman Wriddhiman Saha and Manoj Tiwary are likely to make the grade when the BCCIs senior selection committee meets in Chennai on Monday to pick the team for the Emerging Players Tournament to be held in Australia from July 20. Ashok Dindas name may also come up for discussion.  
	ACA posts  
	 Vijayawada: Controversy-ridden Andhra Cricket Association (ACA) has appointed its womens wing chairman J. Narendra and Anantapur District Association chief M. Ferrer as the vice-presidents after three state government officials resigned in the wake of ACA general secretarys sacking.  
	Sohail denial  
	 Karachi: Former captain Aamer Sohail has rubbished reports that he has been served with a show cause notice by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for failing to attend an ICC course on game development in England. It was not a show cause notice. It was an internal office memo. An unnecessary controversy is being created out of nothing, Sohail said.   
	Pybus Point  
	 Karachi: Former Pakistan coach Richard Pybus said that the countrys current isolation hurts him and he blames it on the financially powerful BCCIs stronghold over the International Cricket Council. I see it as detrimental to world cricket having everyone bend over backwards to please the BCCI. World cricket needs to retain its autonomy, not be playing second fiddle to Indian cricket, Pybus said.   
	 PCB contracts  
	 Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has offered central contracts to opener Imran Nazir, senior batsman Mohammed Yousuf and all-rounder Abdul Razzaq who have returned to the mainstream after snapping ties with the rebel Indian Cricket League. The board has also awarded a C category contract to new left-arm pacer Mohammad Amir who has impressed since making his debut in the World Twenty20 in England.   
	Khalid view  
	 Karachi: Blaming India for isolation in international cricket is harming Pakistan and the country needs to have strong ties with the neighbouring nation to find a way out of the current turmoil, feels former PCB chief Khalid Mehmood. Whether we like it or not India is a big strength and influence in world cricket and we need to have cordial relations with them to find solutions to our problems, Mehmood, who was PCB chairman between 1996 and 1999, said.  
	 Khan no more  
	 Karachi: Former Pakistan pacer Khan Mohammed, who played in the countrys first Test in 1952 against India, has passed away in London after losing his battle with prostate cancer. Mohammed, 81, was living in England for the last four decades and had represented Pakistan in 13 Tests.

	This was not a mere football match, this was a sporting epic that saw emotions taken on a frantic slalom run, two heavyweights pummelling each other relentlessly and a final aggregate scoreline that could have graced a rugby match.         
	This was a night of thrills, spills and battles of wills, an evening of accomplished individual performances from first Javier Mascherano and then Frank Lampard, of alarming contributions from Pepe Reina and Petr Cech. Only when Lampard struck his second goal, making it 4-4 with a minute remaining and leaving Liverpool requiring two, could Chelsea fans finally relax. Rafa Benitezs men had been that determined, that dangerous in front of goal. From the first whistle, the visitors made light of the 3-1 aggregate deficit and the sore adductor that robbed them of Steven Gerrard, playing with an energy that drew on the greatest traditions of this distinguished club.         
	Where to start with a game that had Chelsea booed off at the break and cheered off at the final whistle? For 45 minutes, Hiddinks players were subdued, allowing Liverpool to dictate the rhythm. Chelsea fans sought to raise the tempo and the temperature, willing the team on and vilifying Liverpools support, who responded in spiky kind.         
	Defensive lapses cost Chelsea dear. It also seemed as though the Spanish referee, Luis Medina Cantalejo, was keen to emulate Robert de Niro in Taxi Driver, cleaning up the mean streets of the inner city, clamping down on all the nudges and shirt-pulling so often endemic in English football.         
	When Ricardo Carvalho pulled Dirk Kuyts shirt after 19 minutes, Fabio Aurelio lined up the free-kick. Cech placed his wall too far to the right, Aurelio swerved it the other way and the legend of Cechs infallibility took another knock.         
	Nine minutes later, Aurelio swept in a free-kick and Cantalejo again reprised his impersonation of an angry headmaster tackling six-form antics, punishing Branislav Ivanovic for hauling down Alonso. Cantalejo pointed to the spot, despite no Liverpool player appealing, despite Martin Skrtel tugging at Ivanovics shirt.         
	As Chelsea went into meltdown, Alonso kept calm, placing the ball on the spot, and then emphatically drilling it to Cechs right. Was one of the great upsets on the cards, a great escape of Istanbul proportions pending? The noise pouring out of the Liverpool corner of the ground nearly rocked Stamford Bridge on its foundations. One banner waved vigorously by the away fans said it all  Defiance.

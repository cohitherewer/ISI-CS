The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Inter knocked out by United 
                                                   Inter knocked out by United 
    - FOUR ENGLISH CLUBS ADVANCE TO LAST EIGHT OF CHAMPIONS LEAGUE           Henry Winter                            
	Jose Mourinho hugged Alex Ferguson at the final whistle but it was really the only time that Inter Milan got to grips with Manchester United. Mourinhos team went out of Europe with a whimper, not a bang, losing 0-2 on the night, and Old Trafford serenaded them on their way with chants of bye, bye Mourinho and youre not special any more.         
	As an audition for any future vacancy here, Mourinhos side disappointed. Headers from Nemanja Vidic and Cristiano Ronaldo guaranteed the champions progression to the quarter finals. Serie As reputation for tough defending took a real knock as Uniteds goals, particularly Vidics, were avoidable.         
	Wayne Rooney in particular was superb, whether charging through the middle or keeping the excellent Maicon occupied on the flank in the second half. Rooney was sought out for an embrace by Mourinho, a picture of frustration by the end.         
	As well as moaning about the amount of time added on at the end (two minutes) Mourinho also complained about the ball, a special one dedicated to United as European champions. Uefa politely reminded the Inter coach that he could choose the ball when his team won the competition.         
	The show had begun even before kick-off with Mourinho, breaking off from embracing Carlos Tevez in the tunnel, marching on his own down the touchline, milking the applause and many jeers tumbling forth from the United faithful. It was a piece of pure theatre from the Special One, who will have particularly enjoyed the song accompanying his every step towards the dug-out  This Is The One. His smile soon disappeared.         
	Within five minutes, United were ahead, exploiting a major tactical weakness Mourinho had inexplicably saddled his team with. Inters inexperienced left-back, David Santon, was forced to face Ronaldo with no shielding midfielder. Mario Balotelli, the teenaged striker, started on left tucked in behind Zlatan Ibrahimovic but rarely tracked back. Poor Santon.         
	Mourinho rejigged at the break, inserting Sulley Muntari in front of Santon and pushing Balotelli higher up, but United had the lead by then and were swiftly to add another. Santon, a hugely promising defender, was desperately exposed in the first period. Ronaldo, sensing vulnerability, began running at the full-back, soon winning a fourth-minute corner that brought such substantial reward.         
	Ryan Giggs jogged across to the flag as his teammates began moving into position. As Uniteds captain curled the ball across, men in red shirts sought to escape those in black-and-blue. Vidics move was the most decisive, the Serb twice checking his run to throw Patrick Vieira off the scent. A yard of space gained, Vidic flicked his header imperiously into the goal. The modern tendency to position defenders on only one post was punished.         
	The Stretford End loved it, taunting Mourinho and particularly Vieira, the midfielder who enjoyed a scrap or three here during his Arsenal days. Uniteds players were determined to ram their message home, grabbing a second but Giggs promptly wasted a glorious chance.         
	Inter briefly took confidence. Javier Zanetti, usually an influence on the major occasions, began to control the midfield. Maicon, the Brazilian full-back, started to raid down the right. Ibrahimovic, the spearhead of Inters 4-1-2-2-1 formation, at last hinted at some substance to all the hype, troubling Rio Ferdinand and Vidic. From one Maicon free-kick, the tall Swedish international headed goalwards, the ball bouncing down and up before hitting the bar and flying over.         
	Before Ronaldos header relaxed Uniteds supporters, Inter enjoyed a period of hope. Ibrahimovic set up Dejan Stankovic, whose shot was pushed away by Edwin van der Sar.         
	As United head towards the quarter final draw a week on Friday, Inter return to securing Serie A and intensifying speculation about the future of Mourinho.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Indian Cricket League (ICL) threatened Wednesday to drag the International Cricket Council (ICC) to court if it does not recognise the rebel league.         
	Just two days before the ICC executive board meets in Dubai, Subhash Chandra, the chairman of Essel Group that runs ICL, said: We are hopeful of receiving official recognition at the ICC executive board meeting scheduled for April 17 and 18 in Dubai, failing which we will pursue legal options.         
	The league also announced that the third and fourth edition of the event will be held as per schedule in October this year. The off-season will witness the ICL executive board conducting a detailed Sports Performance Evaluation process, according to a release.

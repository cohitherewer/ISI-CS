The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ashes is the priority, not IPL: Ricky
                                                   Ashes is the priority, not IPL: Ricky
                      
	Melbourne/Durban: Australian skipper Ricky Ponting has indicated that due to a crammed international tour ahead, none of his teammates would be able to play in the second edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Ponting has urged Cricket Australia to prioritise the teams schedule so that he could have all the big players fit for the important series like the Ashes.         
	There has been a lot made about that (the IPL) and we might have one week after Pakistan in Abu Dhabi or wherever it may be. I think we need to worry about the international programme before we worry about the IPL, Ponting said.         
	Australia have a non-stop schedule until May 2010 as they play 26 Tests and about 54 ODIs and 20 Twenty20 Internationals apart from their domestic Twenty20 tournaments.         
	Australia are already grappling with injuries to many players including allrounders Andrew Symonds and Shane Watson.         
	The important thing for me is prioritising and making sure we have all the players that are taking part in those big Test series are fit and ready to go, Ponting said.         
	Meanwhile, South African batting sensation Jean-Paul Duminy is now eager to take part in the lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Duminy, who played a crucial role in South Africas Test series triumph in Australia, said that although he was not thinking too far ahead, he wants to take part in the IPL.         
	I would like to be a part of the IPL or county cricket set-ups, but I dont want to look too far forward and rather concentrate on the last three games of the current ODI series, the 24-year-old said Wednesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | More anxiety for Mickelson
                                                   More anxiety for Mickelson
                      
	San Diego: Six weeks after Phil Mickelson announced his wife had breast cancer, his mother was diagnosed with the disease and is to have surgery later this week.         
	An American daily reported that Mary Mickelson discovered she had breast cancer last week. She is to have surgery on Friday at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, the same hospital where Mickelsons wife, Amy, had surgery last Wednesday.         
	Mickelsons sister, Tina, told the newspaper she wanted to make her mothers condition known so she could receive the same outpouring of support and prayers that meant so much to Amy Mickelson.

                                                   Royals win a thriller
                      
	Durban: Munaf Patel bowled a brilliant last over while Shane Warne overcame a hamstring injury to win his personal duel with Sachin Tendulkar as the Rajasthan Royals edged out the Mumbai Indians by two runs in an Indian Premier League edge-of-the-seat thriller here on Thursday.         
	Chasing 146 for a much-needed win, the Mumbai Indians managed 143 before being all out in 19.5 overs with Tendulkar scoring 40 off 30 balls even though it was Abhishek Nayars quickfire 35 off 18 balls that nearly saw them through.         
	Needing four runs of the last over from Munaf, Mumbai managed just two, while losing their last three wickets.         
	Earlier, Rob Quineys (51) maiden IPL fifty and Ravindra Jadejas brisk 42 guided the Rajasthan Royals to 145 for seven, even though they had 160 in sight at one stage.         
	Mumbai faltered early in their pursuit and their re-jigged top order looked in complete disorder. In fact, by the time Sanath Jayasuriya (16) was joined by Tendulkar in the middle, the side had lost Dwayne Bravo, Ajinkya Rahane and Yogesh Takawale for a paltry 23 runs.         
	Boundaries becoming a rarity, Jayasuriya went after the wily Warne only to become the leggies second victim and then JP Duminy (4) dragged one onto his stumps.         
	Tendulkar hit Jadeja for three fours, preceded by a massive six off Yusuf Pathan. Tendulkar looked at ease against Warne also but the Australian had the last laugh as he went on to trap his old nemesis.         
	Quiney (51) added 43 runs for the opening wicket with Graeme Smith (19) and raised 61 with Jadeja (42) but the Mumbai Indians did well to restrict them inside the 150-mark.         
	The Rajasthan Royals skipper Shane Warne, nursing a hamstring injury, caught everyone by surprise when he walked out for the toss which he won and opted to bat first.         
	JP Duminys innocuous off-spinners troubled Smith and it prompted the Mumbai Indians captain Sachin Tendulkar to press Harbhajan Singh into service, a decision that immediately paid off.         
	Smith went for a heave that found Duminy in the deep and the youngster, who had earlier dropped the batsman, had his moment of redemption.         
	Yusuf (17) sizzled before he fizzled out but Jadeja stepped up to the plate, hitting Harbhajan for two fours in the same over before hitting Duminy out of the park, a treatment he meted out to Bravo too.         
	His aggression rubbed on Quiney as well and the Victorian hit Bravo for a six and followed it up with a four to bring up his maiden IPL fifty before a Malinga yorker crashed through his defence.         
	Sanath Jayasuriya bowled a brilliant last over, claiming two wickets           (AGENCIES)

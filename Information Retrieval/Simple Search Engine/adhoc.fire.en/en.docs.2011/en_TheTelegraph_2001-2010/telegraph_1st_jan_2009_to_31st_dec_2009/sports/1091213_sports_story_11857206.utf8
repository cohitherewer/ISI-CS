	New Delhi: South African Cricketers Association (SACA) Saturday gave its nod to the BCCI proposal of having two Tests and three one dayers  instead of five ODIs  when the Proteas visit India early next year.         
	SACA chief executive Tony Irish said the players would be happy to play more Tests instead of ODIs when they tour India in February-March 2010.         
	We as players are actually in favour of that. We would prefer to go there, and play two Tests and three one-dayers rather than playing five one-dayers, Irish said.         
	He said the BCCIs last-minute request  having realised that just two Tests in the next 11 months would not be enough to protect the teams No. 1 status  was not ideal but felt it was necessary to compromise for the betterment of Test cricket.         
	It is not ideal. But there has to be a set of compromises and we are making some now in order to play Test cricket, the SACA chief executive told a website.         
	South Africa would not complain playing more Tests as they are scheduled to play only five in 2010 as compared to the six in 2009.         
	We believe that it is vital to play as much Test cricket as possible because the players believe it is the pinnacle of cricket, Irish said.         
	Firstly we played so little Test cricket this year, so we are keen to play (more) Test matches. Then we also want to play because India are No. 1 and we are No. 2. It is also good for Test cricket as this shows support for the longer version, said Irish.         
	The players, however, want the two boards to chalk out right dates if the two Tests are to be squeezed in as they do not want to miss out on playing the Pro20, South Africas domestic Twenty20 competition.

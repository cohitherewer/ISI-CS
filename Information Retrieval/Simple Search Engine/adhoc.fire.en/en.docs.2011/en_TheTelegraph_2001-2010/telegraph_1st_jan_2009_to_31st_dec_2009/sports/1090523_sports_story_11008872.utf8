                                                   Performance would have been better under Sourav: Dinda
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sourav Gangulys leadership could have made a big difference to the performance of the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL, the teams pacer Ashok Dinda said on return to the city from South Africa on Friday.         
	The Knight Riders finished at the bottom of the table with only seven points from 14 matches in the second edition of the IPL.         
	The young pacer felt the team, especially the Bengal players, would certainly have performed better under Souravs leadership and that would have reflected on the teams fortunes.         
	Dada knows us inside out... He has seen us grow and knows our strengths and weaknesses. Our performance would have been better under his captaincy. He would have been successful in getting the best out of the players. The team, too, would have benefited, Dinda said.         
	Wriddhiman Saha, who hit the winning runs against the Kings XI Punjab in their penultimate match, also echoed Dindas views saying, It could have made a difference since he knows the players better.         
	Laxmi Ratan Shukla, however, stayed away from the controversy.         
	All the city-based players, except Sourav Sarkar, returned early on Friday by an Emirates flight. John Buchanans son Michael, a member of the Knights support staff, also accompanied them en route to Bangkok.         
	Shukla, enjoying the limelight after his match-winning unbeaten 48 against the Rajasthan Royals in the Knights final game, was looking at the positives.         
	We have to take the positives out. There were a few bright spots like Brad Hodge Dinda also did well with the ball. We have to count the positives. There is a lot to improve though and hopefully we will do better next time, said Shukla.         
	It was just a bad phase and the sooner we recover, the better for the side. There was a lot of soul searching I feel we lost our matches in the last five overs of the innings. We have to tighten up to make sure that it does not happen next time, he added.         
	Would he rate the innings as his best ever? No Not the best ever. It was special and gave me a lot of exposure, but I certainly wouldnt rate it the best. I was happy to have proved my credibility and brought the smiles back in the camp.         
	Should he have been played in all the 14 matches? That is up to the think-tank to decide. I gave my best, was Shuklas response.         
	The Bengal captain felt the exposure had helped the state players a lot. It will help us all Youngsters like Arindam Ghosh benefited the most.         
	Shukla, Dinda and Saha agreed that the controversies surrounding the team had no bearing on their performance. Controversies didnt affect us T20 is all about uncertainty and we lost some very close matches, was the common refrain. They also dismissed reports of any racial abuse.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kimi does a volte-face
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kimi does a volte-face
                      
	London: Kimi Raikkonens plans for a one year sabbatical from Formula One lasted less than 24 hours before his manager suggested that he might be open to offers from Brawns new owners Mercedes.         
	Steve Robertson told a motor racing website on Thursday that the Finn, who failed to reach a deal with McLaren after leaving Ferrari, was not 100 percent certain to be absent next year.         
	This is Formula One, said the Briton, who manages the 2007 world champion with his father David.         
	If they can offer, or convince us, that they can provide Kimi an opportunity that Kimi is happy with, and that we are happy with, and he feels he can win races and the championship, then never say never. There is always a possibility. (Reuters)

	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Tuesday announced a bonus of Rs 15 lakh for each player after the teams historic Test and one-day series victories in New Zealand.         
	The 1-0 Test series win was Indias first on New Zealand soil since Mansur Ali Khan Pataudis team achieved the feat in 1967-68. India should now aim for the No. 1 spot, Pataudi told reporters in New Delhi.         
	BCCI president Shashank Manohar, while congratulating the team, announced the bonus for each player involved in the Tests and ODIs, besides Rs 10 lakh each for the support staff.         
	Chandu Borde, who was part of that Indian team under Pataudi, said the current side would rank as one of the best teams.         
	I am doubly happy now that India has won a Test series in New Zealand after 41 years. The way this team kept on performing was amazing. I have watched so many Indian teams over the years and I think this is one of the best we ever had, Borde said.         
	Erapalli Prasanna, who played a big role in the 1968 victory, said: I am delighted by the series victory.         
	Every body has done their bit. But the tail-enders scoring runs have been a revelation of this tour, Prasanna said.         
	Chairman of selectors Krishnamachari Srikkanth singled out the hunger to win among the players as the driving force behind the success. This team has been performing consistently in recent times.         
	What makes this team different is the way the boys come out with flying colours from difficult situations. This team has the hunger to win all the time, that is their biggest asset, he said.         
	President Pratibha Patil also congratulated the team for winning the Test series.

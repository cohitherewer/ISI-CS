	Calcutta: Sania Mirza rose to No.68, an improvement of 19 places, in the doubles ranking on the back of her strong showing in the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami where she reached the last-four stage with partner Chia-jung Chuang of Taiwan. However, Sania remained at No.100 on the singles list in the WTA rankings released Monday.         
	Somdev Dev Varman was Indias highest-ranked male tennis player at No.150. On the doubles list, both Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi slid down the ladder. While Paes lost a place to be at No.6 Bhupathi finds himself at No.10 after a loss of two places.         
	Rafael Nadal continues to be at the top of mens singles while Serena Williams remained at No.1 in the womens rankings.

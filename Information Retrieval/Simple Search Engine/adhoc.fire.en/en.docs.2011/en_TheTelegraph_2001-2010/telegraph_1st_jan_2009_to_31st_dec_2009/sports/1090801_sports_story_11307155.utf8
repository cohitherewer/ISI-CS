The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saina set for early return 
                                                   Saina set for early return 
                      
	Hyderabad: Shuttler Saina Nehwal is recovering fast from chicken pox and is all set to return to practice on Monday, her father Harvir Singh Nehwal said Friday.         
	The disease had rendered the Hyderabadi doubtful for the upcoming World Championships. She is recovering very well. There are no fresh rashes in her body. We met the doctor yesterday (Thursday) and he said no medication is required at the moment.         
	We will again meet him Saturday. Hopefully, she should be able to resume training from Monday, Harvir said.         
	Saina, who was down with mild fever from last week, had been diagnosed with chicken pox on Wednesday, moments after she won the Arjuna Award.         
	She was advised complete bed rest for a few days by the doctors, casting a shadow of uncertainty over her participation in the World Championship to be held in her home city from August 10.         
	She is only on light food and not exerting any pressure on her body. She is doing two to three hours of meditation everyday, Harvir said.         
	A disheartened Saina had admitted on Thursday that even if she managed to regain fitness ahead of the event starting August 10, she would be low on practice.         
	Dr Hari Prasad, the Chief Executive Officer of Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad, where Saina is undergoing treatment said the world No. 6 is making a steady progress.         
	Saina is recovering well. I havent seen her today (Friday) but her chicken pox is receding. She will be back on court within a few days, Dr Prasad said. (PTI)

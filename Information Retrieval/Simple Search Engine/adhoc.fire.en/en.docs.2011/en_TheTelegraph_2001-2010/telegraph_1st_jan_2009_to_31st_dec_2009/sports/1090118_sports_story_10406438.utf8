The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bellamy goes on strike
                                                   Bellamy goes on strike

	Craig Bellamy was in confrontation with West Ham United Friday after he was refused permission to talk to Tottenham Hotspur. The Wales forward made a verbal transfer request and said goodbye to staff after a meeting with Scott Duxbury, the chief executive.         
	Bellamy, who did not train Friday and cleared some items from his locker at the training ground, has refused to play against Fulham Sunday.         
	West Ham have turned down three bids from Tottenham  the latest being an initial 10m, rising to 12m, and say that they have offered Bellamy a new long-term deal to stay. If forced to let Bellamy go, the East London club would probably prefer to sell Bellamy to Manchester City, who have also had three bids turned down.         
	West Ham believe that Bellamy, 29, should honour his commitment to play for the club after they helped him through stomach and groin injuries last season. West Ham have serious concerns about Tottenhams pursuit of Bellamy after a media report said that the player had met a representative of Spurs on Thursday night.         
	Harry Redknapp, the Tottenham manager, denied that they had tapped up any players, but his club has faced criticism from Middlesbrough, for their pursuit of Stewart Downing, and Sunderland, for their recent interest in Kenwyne Jones.         
	If proved, it could be embarrassing for Tottenham, who complained about the way that Liverpool and Manchester United tried to sign Robbie Keane and Dimitar Berbatov respectively in the summer.

                                                   Had to raise my game: Somdev
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Somdev Dev Varman lived up to the tag of the countrys No.1 player when he led India to a 3-2 win over Chinese Taipei in the Davis Cup Asia-Oceania Group I second round tie in Kaohsiung on Sunday. Dev Varman upset world no. 59 Yen-Hsun Lu 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 in the first of two reverse singles matches at the Yang Ming Tennis Centre to seal the tie for India.         
	Eighteen-year-old Tsung-Hua Yang, Yuki Bhambris predecessor as the junior world No.1, defeated Rohan Bopanna 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-5) in the dead rubber to reduce the margin for the hosts.         
	India will now take on former champions Australia  who overcame Thailand 3-2 in Nonthaburi  in a home tie in the third round from May 8 to 10.         
	Going in to the reverse singles with a 2-1 lead, India were looking at the prospect of the tie going down to the wire. Given that Dev Varman was far from his best against Ti Chen in the opening singles, Lu, who had beaten David Nalbandian in the Australian Open and former world No.1 Lleyton Hewitt last month, looked to be a tough opponent for him.         
	But the 24-year-old dispelled such apprehensions with a stunning performance that made the game a one-sided affair. I was a bit nervous going into the match against Chen and I didnt play my best tennis. I played well enough though, Dev Varman told The Telegraph from Kaohsiung.         
	Today I knew I had to raise the level of my game by a few notches and keep the pressure on Lu. I did exactly that and broke down Lus game.         
	Team captain Shiv Prakash Mishra said the Assam-born player has made a huge impact on the Indian team. The pressure of expectations after the Chennai Open was weighing him down (in the first match), but he has lived up to his billing by winning two singles matches in an away tie, he said.         
	Dev Varmans coming of age is bound to put the Indian teams think-tank in a spot. During his junior days, he excelled on the clay courts, but the four-year stint in US collegiate tennis has made him a true hard court pro. That probably also was a factor in his singles defeats against Romania last year.         
	What this means is that India will now have to decide on what surface to play on against Australia. Traditionally, grass has been the first choice. Many feel that although it is no longer the favourite surface of the current crop of players, it is a disadvantage to the visiting teams. With Dev Varmans success, however, that strategy might have to change.         
	All his (Dev Varmans) tennis has flourished only in the US. He rallies excellently from the baseline. We have to go for a surface that suits our No.1 player best, Mishra said.         
	Asked if he meant that India should host Australia on hard courts, Mishra said: Well have to ask the All India Tennis Association (AITA) about that.         
	I would prefer to play Australia on hard courts ... Hewitt may or may not be there, but it doesnt matter, he added.

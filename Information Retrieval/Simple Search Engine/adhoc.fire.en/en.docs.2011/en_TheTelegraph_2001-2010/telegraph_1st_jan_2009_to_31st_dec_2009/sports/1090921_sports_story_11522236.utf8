                                                     Gill seals it in style
            A STAFF REPORTER            Gaurav Gill                           
	Calcutta: Team MRFs Gaurav Gill and co-driver Musa Sherif clocked the best time in the Spectator Special Stage to win the Rally de Kolkata, the third round of the Speed-Indian National Rally Championship, sponsored by Bharat Petroleum, at the Santoshpur Stadium Sunday.         
	Gill, driving a Mitsubishi Lancer Cedia, was two seconds quicker than arch-rival city driver Amittrajit Ghosh over two laps of the 1.2 km long circuit to bag the overall honour along with the 2000cc N+ category. Amittrajit, was driving with co-driver Ashwin Naik.         
	The 28-year old Gill was the quickest on all the three days to pick up 16 points to mark his presence in the National Championship stakes after two non-finishes in the previous rounds in Coimbatore and Bangalore. Unless the pending protests change the point positions, Amittrajit will trail Gill by a narrow margin in the INRC with three rounds to go.

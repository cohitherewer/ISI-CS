                                                   FROM LAST TO FIRST
            A CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Before the start of the tournament, very few would have put their money on the Deccan Chargers winning this years Indian Premier League after their dismal performance in the inaugural edition. But the Hyderabad side, who looked second best during most of Sundays match, defeated the Royal Challengers Bangalore by six runs in an engrossing final at the Bullring in Johannesburg.         
	The team that ended at the bottom of the table in the inaugural edition, have, a year later, under a new captain in Adam Gilchrist and a new coach in Darren Lehman, managed to lay their hands on the trophy.         
	Pushed on to the backfoot right at the start by an inspired spell of bowling from the Royal Challengers captain Anil Kumble (four for 16) the Chargers fought back to reach a respectable 143 for six. They returned to bowl all charged up and, with some brilliant fielding and intelligent bowling, made the target look very steep for the Royal Challengers.         
	The Chargers picked up wickets at regular intervals but the Royal Challengers remained in the hunt with useful contributions from Roelof van der Merwe (32 off 21 balls) and Ross Taylor (27 off 20 balls).         
	It was the 15th over that proved to be the turning point of the match. Till then, the Royal Challengers seemed to have the target well under control. But Symonds picked up the crucial wickets of Taylor and Virat Kohli (seven off eight balls) off consecutive deliveries to deal a killer blow to the Bangalore outfit. Taylors attempted pull shot took the top-edge and went straight to fine-leg. Gilchrist, the Chargers captain, pulled off a brilliant stumping off the next ball to send Kohli back to the hut.         
	The dismissal of Mark Boucher in the following over, off Harmeet Singh, took the chase out of the Challengers reach. With the Challengers needing 27 off the last two overs with two wickets in hand, the match looked as good as over for them. Robin Uthappas little cameo (17 off 15 balls) was never going to be enough.         
	Left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha played his part, picking up three wickets for 28 off his four overs as did RP Singh, the winner of the Purple Cap (the tournaments highest wicket-taker), by keeping a cool head while bowling the last over. RP gave away only eight runs with 15 required to win.         
	Earlier, Kumble gave the Royal Challengers a dream start. Coming on to bowl with the new ball, the skipper of the Bangalore side dismissed the dangerous Gilchrist for a duck off his third delivery.         
	The former Australia wicketkeeper-batsman misread the leg-spinners googly and was clean bowled after charging down the wicket.         
	Tirumalsetti Suman (10) took a risk too many and was out caught in the covers by Manish Pandey off R. Vinay Kumar.         
	Symonds (33) looked in great touch during his stay at the crease and hit four boundaries and a huge six in his 21-ball knock. Dravid, who holds the record for the highest number of Test catches, dropped the Australian all-rounder on five at first slip. Symonds steered Vinay Kumar straight into the hands of Dravid, who made a mess of the sitter.         
	Dropping the dangerous Symonds could have proved costly for the Royal Challengers but for his unlucky dismissal. Symonds could only drag a long hop from Kumble onto his stumps while attempting a pull.         
	The Chargers managed only 31 for the loss of two wickets in the first six overs of Powerplay and were struggling for momentum with 62 on the board for the loss of three wickets at the halfway stage.         
	The Royal Challengers picked up wickets at key moments in the last 10 overs of the Chargers innings and managed to keep a check on the run-rate. Herschelle Gibbs played a very responsible innings and remained unbeaten on 53 off 48 deliveries after opening the innings alongside Gilchrist. Gibbs shed off his usual flamboyance on Sunday and played the sheet anchors role. He still managed to hit two huge sixes  both off Praveen Kumar  and three boundaries.         
	Kumble picked up two more wickets in the last over of his spell, the 17th of the innings. Rohit Sharma (24 off 23 balls) misread the flight and holed out at long-off. Young Manish made a lot off ground and had to dive forward to complete an excellent catch.         
	Four balls later, Y. Venugopal Rao tried to hit one out of the ground through the off-side but ended straight into the hands of Taylor at extra- cover.         
	Vinay Kumar supported his captain well and picked up two wickets for 30 in his four overs. Praveen was completely off colour on Sunday and bowled a barrage of wide deliveries to concede 43 runs off his four overs.

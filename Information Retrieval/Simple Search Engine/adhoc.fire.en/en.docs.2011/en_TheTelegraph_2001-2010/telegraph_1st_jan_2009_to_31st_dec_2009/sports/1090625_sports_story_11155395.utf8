The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Inty in favour of one leader in all forms
                                                   Inty in favour of one leader in all forms
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam is in favour of one captain in all forms of the game since it fosters better co-ordination among the team members.         
	Alam, who said he was not informed by Younis Khan before announcing retirement from Twenty20 cricket, said he would prefer him to lead all three teams  Test, ODI and T20.         
	Having one captain for Tests, ODIs and T20 cricket means you have more harmony in the team and the players are also comfortable with their captain. The communication levels improve a lot with this arrangement within the team, Alam said.         
	The former Test captain, who has the rare distinction of guiding two separate Pakistan teams to World Cup glory in ODIs and T20, said he would like to see Younis reconsider his decision.         
	He didnt talk to us about it. His announcement came as a surprise to me as well, he added.         
	Alam said the Pakistan Cricket Board and selectors would now have to take a call on who would lead the country in the T20 international during the upcoming tour of Sri Lanka.         
	I am happy that Younis has handled things very well. He is a very good captain and showed lot of maturity in the World Cup and the players responded equally well, he added.         
	Younis had said he took the decision to retire from T20 cricket after much thought as he was too old for the shortest form of the game.         
	Looking ahead to the tour of Sri Lanka, Alam said the players would start preparing for the Test series after a few days rest.         
	Mohammed Yousuf is back which is good news for our batting. The players have been told to change their mindset for the coming Test series as Sri Lanka are a very good side and hard to beat on their home ground, he said.         
	The former skipper said the players were well aware of the challenge they would face against the Sri Lankan spinners in the Test series.         
	The team leaves on June 27 to play three Tests, five one-day Internationals and a T20 match.         
	Alam hoped the World T20 victory would help Pakistan host more international matches.         
	The victory has come at a good time. It has enhanced our image as a sports loving nation and also lifted the gloom of the people, said Alam.         
	Former captain Shoaib Malik has credited Pakistans Cup triumph to his successor Younis leadership skills and a short stint of the players with a sports psychologist.         
	Younis led the side well and he showed he is a good captain, Malik said. (PTI)

	Nagaon: Mohammedan Sporting Friday beat Jammu amp; Kashmir Bank 1-0 at the Nurul Amin Stadium to qualify for the 31st Federation Cup main round.         
	Satyajit Bose struck the winner in the 24th minute with a power-packed shot off a pass from striker Gautam Thakur.         
	Sporting dominated the proceedings in the first-half and, although J amp;K Bank were fast-paced and relentless in the second, they could hardly dent the Calcutta clubs defence.         
	In the first match on Tuesday, Sporting had defeated North Imphal Sports Association 2-0 to enter the final qualifying round.

	New York: Top-ranked Dinara Safina overcame another shaky day of tennis to advance to the third round of the US Open defeating Kristina Barrois. Compatriot and fourth seed Elena Dementieva was shown the door by American teenager Melanie Oudin on Thursday at Flushing Meadows.         
	Safina won 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-3, earning the victory despite 38 unforced errors and 15 double-faults in her second straight uncomfortably close match.         
	She is ranked first despite having never won a major and she did little in this match against the 67th-ranked player in the world to cool the debate about whether she really belongs there.         
	The 70th-ranked Oudin came back to stun Dementieva 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 in Arthur Ashe Stadium. Dementieva was the 2004 runner-up at the US Open and French Open and won the singles gold medal at the Beijing Olympics last year.         
	The 17-year-old Oudin, meanwhile, never had won a US Open match until this week. She had never won a Grand Slam match until reaching the fourth round at Wimbledon this year.         
	In other early action Thursday, Tommy Haas, seeded No. 20, defeated American Robert Kendrick.         
	On the womens side, 13th-seeded Nadia Petrova advanced with a win over Frenchwoman Julie Coin 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) while No. 30 Alona Bondarenko lost to Gisela Dulko 4-6, 0-6. Sorana Cirstea, the 24th seed from Romania, beat Canadian Stephanie Dubois 6-4, 5-7, 6-4.         
	Safina, playing in the smaller Louis Armstrong Stadium for a Thursday matinee, needed 2 hours, 13 minutes, much of which looked like the 2 hour-25 minute display she put on in her three-set opener against Olivia Rogowska.         
	In fact, the endings of the first sets were identical: Safina double-faulting on set point to lose a 7-5 tiebreaker. And, as in the first round, Safina came back with a stronger second set to win 6-2.         
	The third set was 3-3 when Barrois game collapsed. She missed an easy forehand on break point against her in the seventh game, then committed five unforced errors over the final two games before losing it with a double-fault on match point.         
	Barrois finished with 43 unforced errors, including 17 in the final set.         
	For Barrois to play shaky tennis is one thing. For the top-ranked woman in the world to do it is another.         
	The topic of Safinas worthiness as No. 1  a ranking shell keep no matter what happens at the US Open  has spread beyond her and Serena Williams.         
	Meanwhile on Wednesday, No. 2 Serena Williams, going for her third major of the season, dispatched her opponent, Hungarian Melinda Czink 6-1, 6-1 in 53 minutes in the final match in Arthur Ashe Stadium.         
	Serena has won three of the past four major tournaments, but she hasnt won a single nonmajor during that time.         
	Maybe it pays more, she said with a smile, when asked to explain the disparity. I guess Im trying to pay off my mortgage.         
	On a day of farewells, 36-year-old Fabrice Santoros 69th and final major outing ended in defeat.         
	Comeback mum Kim Clijsters completed a forgettable day for the French when she beat 14th seed Marion Bartoli 5-7, 6-1, 6-2.         
	This years Open is turning out to be a family affair as world No. 1 Roger Federer and Australian Lleyton Hewitt will get a chance to compare notes on how to survive the demands of the tour with young children in tow after they set up an intriguing third-round showdown.         
	In a break with US Open traditions, the evening session kicked off with the mens match between five-time champion Federer and Simon Greul.         
	The pesky German journeyman provided Federer with a few jitters when he held two set points in the second set and a 3-0 lead in the third but in the end could not prevent the Swiss from chalking up a 6-3, 7-5, 7-5 win.

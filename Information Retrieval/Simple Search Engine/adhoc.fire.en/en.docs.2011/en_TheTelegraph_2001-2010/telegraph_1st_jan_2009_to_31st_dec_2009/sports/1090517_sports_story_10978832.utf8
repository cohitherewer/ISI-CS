The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Boxers left stranded
                                                   Boxers left stranded
                      
	New Delhi: An Indian boxing contingent, which had travelled to Almaty, Kazakhstan for a training-cum-competition event, was stranded there Saturday after local organisers goofed up on a registration process for visiting athletes.         
	The 10-member team, that includes Olympic quarter finalist Jitender Kumar, along with coach Jaidev Bisht is unlikely to be back in the country until Tuesday.         
	The Indian team, which finished with a gold, a silver and a couple of bronze medals at the event, was scheduled to board the flight for India on Saturday, but was turned back from the airport after it was discovered that the organisers had not fulfilled a mandatory registration process.         
	Anyone staying in Kazakhstan for more than five days is required to be registered, which is the responsibility of the local organisers but they didnt fulfil it. It is completely the fault of the local Kazakh officials, Jitender said.         
	Our visa has expired. We have contacted the Indian embassy and some local Indians are taking care of our boarding and lodging, he revealed.         
	The IBF swung into action after getting the news.We have contacted the Kazakh officials and they are saying that the team will be given all the support, IBF secretary Col P.K. Muralidharan Raja said.         
	Apart from Jitender, the others in the team are reigning youth world champion T. Nanao Singh (48kg), former cadet world champion Vipin Kumar (51kg), Chhote Lal Yadav (57kg), Rakesh Kalaskar (60kg), Balwinder Singh (64kg), Jagat (75kg), Dinesh Kumar (81kg), Guru Lal (91kg), Ram Singh (+91kg).

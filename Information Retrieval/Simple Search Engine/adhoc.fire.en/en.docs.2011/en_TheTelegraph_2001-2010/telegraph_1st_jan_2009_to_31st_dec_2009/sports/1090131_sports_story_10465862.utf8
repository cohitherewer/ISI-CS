                                                     Williams sisters clinch doubles crown
                              
	Melbourne: Serena and Venus Williams won their eighth Grand Slam womens doubles title Friday with a 6-3, 6-3 win over Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia and Japans Ai Sugiyama.         
	The Williams sisters, seeded 10th, were untroubled in the Australian Open final as they served out the first set in just 38 minutes under a closed roof on centre court.         
	The temperature topped 45 Celsius (113F) in the late afternoon and the roof on Rod Laver Arena was closed when the tournaments Extreme Heat Policy was put in effect.         
	The second set proved more difficult as the pairs exchanged breaks six times in nine games before the Williams powerful returns and superior movement around the court proved the deciding factor.

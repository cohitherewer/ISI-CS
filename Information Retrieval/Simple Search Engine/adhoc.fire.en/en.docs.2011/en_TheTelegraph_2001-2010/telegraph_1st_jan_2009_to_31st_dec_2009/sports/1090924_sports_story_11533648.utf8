The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India are back at the top
                                                   India are back at the top
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The race for the top spot in the International Cricket Councils ODI rankings has been more like a game of musical chairs with South Africa, India and Australia sitting atop the chart on different occasions over the last two weeks.         
	South Africas defeat in the Champions Trophy opener against Sri Lanka on Tuesday has propelled second-placed India to the top of the ODI rankings.         
	This is the second time, within a fortnight, that the Indians have moved to the top of the ODI rankings chart.         
	India were placed at the No.2 spot before the start of the tri-series in Sri Lanka which also involved New Zealand.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhonis men registered a 46-run victory against the Black Caps on September 11 to move to the top spot ahead of South Africa.         
	But India slumped to a 139-run loss to hosts Sri Lanka in their very next match to slip down to the third spot, within 24 hours, behind South Africa and Australia.         
	However, their victory in the final against the same opponents by 46 runs helped India climb back to No.2.         
	Australia, who played England in a seven-match ODI-series before the Champions Trophy, also had their share of the spotlight when they moved to the top spot after they beat the hosts by 111 runs on September 17 to take a 6-0 lead in the series.         
	Australias surge pushed India to No.3 with South Africa being placed at No.2.         
	But the Aussies were required to win their last match of the series in England to retain the No.1 spot.         
	They lost their final match by four wickets to surrender the top spot back to South Africa.         
	With the loss, Australia dropped to No.3 while India, once again, moved back to the second spot.         
	India, scheduled to play their opening match of the Champions Trophy on Saturday against Pakistan, have 126 ratings points.         
	South Africa slumped to the third spot after losing Tuesday to Sri Lanka.         
	South Africas loss also helped Australia, which gained a place to be second with 125 ratings points.         
	Sri Lanka occupy the fourth spot, while Pakistan are in the fifth position.         
	The ICC rankings are set for more changes in the next few days as the Champions Trophy continues.

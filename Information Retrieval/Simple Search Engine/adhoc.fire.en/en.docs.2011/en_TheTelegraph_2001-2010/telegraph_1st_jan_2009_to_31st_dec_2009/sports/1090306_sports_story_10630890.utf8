  - New Zealand tour 
  -  Second One-Day International today
            A CORRESPONDENT            Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Virender Sehwag in Wellington on Thursday. (Reuters)                                 
	Wellington: The terror strike in Lahore was the main talking point when Virender Sehwag spoke to the media Thursday, the eve of the second ODI against New Zealand.         
	Sehwag expressed shock, saying he never thought cricketers could be targeted. But he insisted that cricketers are safe in India and there is no reason to worry about security during the Indian Premier League (IPL).               
	The following are excerpts                 
	If he thinks the team needs more security in the wake of the terror attack         
	I dont think we need more security here. New Zealand is a good country. The crime rate here is low. Been to lot of airports, and nobody disturbs us, and I dont think there is any security worry.         
	On his initial reaction to the incident         
	I was shocked when I got the news. I thought terrorists would never target cricketers, but now they are doing so. Its very sad. When I got the news, I immediately sent messages to Sangakkara, Jayawardene and Muralidharan. I got replies immediately. Good to know they were safe.         
	On the situation back home         
	Its a different scenario when we go home. Everybody has his own security, or from police or government.         
	If cricketers going to India for the IPL are safe         
	I think they are very secure in India. The kind of incidents that have happened in India can happen anywhere. I believe cricketers are safer in India than in many other countries because after the Mumbai attacks, security is very tight. Whoever goes to play in IPL is safe.         
	If the New Zealand cricketers playing in the IPL are apprehensive about security in India         
	I had a chat with Daniel (Vettori, who plays for Sehwags team Delhi DareDevils). I told him you are safe in Delhi. We are getting more security also.         
	On the pitches         
	This time wickets are good. The ball is coming on to the bat nicely. Its flat and hard, so I am enjoying. Last time around we didnt get these kind of wickets. I am pretty happy with the grounds and the wickets.         
	On the opponents         
	We know New Zealand are a good side. They will come hard at us, and we are ready for that. We have to play good cricket if we want to beat New Zealand in New Zealand.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav, Dav bond to be the best
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sourav, Dav bond to be the best
            A STAFF REPORTER            Sourav Ganguly                           
	Calcutta: If one had a close look at the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) two-day conditioning camp at Eden Gardens, the big-time bonding between newly-appointed coach Dav Whatmore and skipper Sourav Ganguly wouldnt have gone unnoticed. Something missing in the last edition with predecessor John Buchanan at the helm.         
	Therefore, it wasnt really surprising to hear Whatmore praise the former India captain during his interaction with the media after the conclusion of the camp Tuesday.         
	Sourav will have to play an active role for the franchises well-being. He has been an inspirational leader who has made an immense contribution for the country. So far, its been a wonderful experience working with the team as well as Sourav, Whatmore said.         
	On Tuesday, the coach was seen spending quite some time with Sourav, having a discussion on the southpaws stance, fixing the skippers elbow position and, also, telling him a thing or two about the backlift.         
	When asked, he smiled. It was a normal interaction. I believe the coach and the captain need to communicate well.         
	Whatmore, however, treaded carefully when asked about the controversial multiple captains theory, floated by John Buchanan.         
	All I know is that Sourav is the captain and Dav Whatmore is the coach. I am very happy with this arrangement, was his reply.         
	The coach of the 96 World Cup-winning Sri Lanka side also clearly stated that he didnt believe in dwelling in the past.         
	I wouldnt like to reflect on what happened in the past two editions. We have to look ahead. Our endeavour is to build a strong KKR side. If you have a look at the matches we played in the last edition, we lost quite a few close encounters. The basic idea will be to turn the close games around in our favour, Whatmore explained.         
	Asked about Mohnish Parmars dip in form after his bowling action was altered, the former India colts coach admitted that the Gujarat offie would take time to get back into the groove.         
	I have seen Mohnish at the National Cricket Academy and I am confident that his new action will be cleared by any authority. He will take time to adjust to the new action But I can tell you that he is working very hard. It would be unfair to expect the same performances he delivered a couple of seasons back with his old action, the coach added.         
	The franchise will hold its next camp in January and the coach expects a larger pool of players then. More the players we have access to, the better it is for the camp. It will be even better if we can have the foreign stars It is not always possible due to the international schedule, he further added.         
	The coach leaves for the capital on Wednesday where he will be watching the Ranji Trophy match between Delhi and Saurashtra. It will give him an opportunity to not only interact with assistant coach Vijay Dahiya but also watch the Cheteswar Pujaras in action.

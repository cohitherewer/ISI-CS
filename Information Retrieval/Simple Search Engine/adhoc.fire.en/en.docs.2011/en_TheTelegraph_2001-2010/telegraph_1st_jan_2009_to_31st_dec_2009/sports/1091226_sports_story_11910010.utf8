The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Expected   a chance: Dinda
                                                                                                                       7                                        Expected   a chance: Dinda
            A STAFF REPORTER            Ashok Dinda                                 
	Calcutta: Ashok Dinda couldnt have asked for a better Christmas gift. On Friday, the news of being included in the 15-member Indian squad for the fifth one-day International against Sri Lanka in Delhi Sunday and the 16-member squad for the tri-series in Bangladesh must have been the sweetest jingle for him.         
	I was elated when the news came. Raja Venkat called me up to convey the news Im extremely happy that I have been picked for the Indian team again, an overjoyed Dinda said told The Telegraph.         
	Dinda was also picked for the national squad for the two Twenty20 matches against Sri Lanka, which preceded the ODI series earlier this month.         
	Asked whether he expected the call, Dinda replied: I did expect that I might get a chance I knew that I was in the selectors radar and Im thankful to God for providing me with a chance to achieve something for India. Playing for India has always been my dream and I want to cherish this experience.         
	The right-arm medium pacer also feels that his performance in the first T20 against the Lankans in Nagpur, where he claimed one for 34, helped in impressing the selectors. I had bowled pretty well in Nagpur and also took (Sanath) Jayasuriyas wicket. Definitely the selectors have taken note of that and I think that has helped me in clinching a berth.

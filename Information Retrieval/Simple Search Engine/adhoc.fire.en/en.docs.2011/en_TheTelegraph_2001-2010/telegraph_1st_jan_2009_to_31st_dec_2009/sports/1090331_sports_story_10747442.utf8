	Key Biscayne: Andy Roddick reached the fourth round of the Sony Ericsson Open on Sunday after overcoming two set points in the tiebreaker to beat Dmitry Tursunov of Russia 7-6(11-9), 6-2.         
	The fifth-seeded Roddick erased one set point with an ace and the second when Tursunov netted a forehand, and won the final three points in a gruelling 75-minute first set. Roddick finished with 11 aces and faced only one breakpoint.         
	Roddick, who improved his record this year to 25-4 and leads the ATP Tour in victories, lost his temper early in the set when mist fell and umpire Cedric Mourier declined to stop play. After losing his serve, Roddick slammed down his racket, picked it up and threw it again.         
	He said, Well, no one has fallen yet. I said, Well, if thats a barometer, then we have a problem. So I feel like my argument was just, but the way I went about it probably wasnt the best.         
	Roddick said he apologised to Mourier after the match. Second-seeded Roger Federer also won, beating Nicolas Kiefer for the 11th consecutive time, 6-4, 6-1.         
	Roddicks next opponent will be No.9 Gael Monfils, who rallied from two service breaks down in the final set to beat two-time Grand Slam champion Marat Safin 5-7, 7-5, 7-6(7-3). Roddick, Taylor Dent and the Williams sisters were the only Americans to reach the fourth round. No.13 James Blake lost to No.21 Tomas Berdych 6-4, 6-7(3-7), 6-3.         
	Dents opponent Tuesday will be Federer. Top-ranked Serena Williams, seeking a record sixth Key Biscayne title, made the round of 16 by beating Peng Shuai 7-5, 6-2. No.5-seed Venus Williams defeated Anna-Lena Groenefeld 7-5, 6-3.         
	There were two upsets on the womens side, both involving last years French Open finalists. No.7-seed Ana Ivanovic, the defending Roland Garros champion, lost to No.25 Agnes Szavay 6-4, 4-6, 6-1. No.2 Dinara Safina was beaten by unseeded Samantha Stosur 6-1, 6-4. (AP)

	Calcutta: Theres talk that Sourav Ganguly could turn out for Essex for a short county stint in June-July 2010. The county wants him to play a few Twenty20 matches.         
	However, there was no confirmation from the former India captain till late on Monday.         
	It may be recalled that Middlesex, who have already signed Adam Gilchrist for the Twenty20 Cup, are hoping to secure the services of Sachin Tendulkar as well.         
	According to the county, Sachin is yet to get the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias approval.         
	Sourav previously has had county stints with Lancashire (2000), Glamorgan (2005) and Northants (2006).         
	Meanwhile, it was learnt that Sourav could also participate in exhibition matches in Florida and Toronto in February.

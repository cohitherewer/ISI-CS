            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mahindra United coach David Booth Monday said he hoped the SAFF Cup triumph would be a turning point for three of his boys who were part of the victorious India under-23 team.         
	I am very pleased for them and the Indian team as a whole. It was quite a young side and playing against experienced teams would have done them a world of good, Booth, who was voted Best Coach by the Football Players Association of India, said.         
	The 61-year-old Englishman was particularly happy for Sushil Kumar Singh, who led the Indian team in Bangladesh.         
	He is a good player. I just hope that the competition has given him confidence, because thats what he has been lacking, he said.         
	Defenders Dharmaraj Ravanan and Denzel Franco complete the trio.

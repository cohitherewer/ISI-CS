The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bangla coach vents fury
                                                   Bangla coach vents fury
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Nottingham: A shade over two years ago, Ireland knocked Pakistan out of the 50-over World Cup. On Monday afternoon, at Trent Bridge, they threw Bangladesh out of the World T20.         
	Bangladesh, in fact, got whipped  losing by six wickets with 1.4 overs remaining.         
	Given what happened to Bob Woolmer in Kingston, back in March 2007, Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons has reason to feel uneasy. Immediately after the defeat, though, he was fuming.         
	So much so that Siddons, an Australian, didnt hesitate to tick off his captain, Mohammed Ashraful, who was seated next to him at a media conference.         
	Poor Ashraful, not too tall anyway, began to look even smaller.         
	The batsmen made some stupid mental errors... Right now, I dont know whether Im angry or disappointed... Dont know how to treat the players... Even Ashraful made the same mistake... Six-seven batsmen made errors, getting out to ridiculous shots...         
	My boys just keep disobeying plans... If you keep doing that then you end up with shitty little scores like 138 (for eight)... Ideally, we shouldve got 180, but had a back-up in case we got 160 or so, Siddons exploded.         
	That wasnt all.         
	The players dont seem to listen... They keep having it their way, from things like boarding the team bus... Somebody needs to (put them in their place)... Sure, weve come a long way, but need to go a long way still... Im not offering any excuse and I apologise to our fans, Siddons added.         
	Later, asked by The Telegraph whether hes as blunt at team meetings, Siddons replied: Absolutely... All the time, mate... From my side, I keep trying... Thats all that I can do.         
	Ashraful, for his part, disagreed with a suggestion that Bangladesh took Ireland lightly.         
	Its a problem in the mind... Our shot selection wasnt good in both matches (first against defending champions India)... Weve got no choice but to play well in all departments...         
	The Phil Simmons-coached Ireland, incidentally, had thrashed Bangladesh in the Super Eight-stage of the 2007 (50-over) World Cup.         
	MoM Niall Brien, one of the seven whod been in the XI which upset Pakistan, hurt his right ankle and may undergo an MRI scan on Tuesday.         
	Its not clear whether he will be available for Wednesdays match against India.         
	I tend to play well on the big occasions, though Ive let myself down a few times... We look to win as many matches as we can... Our future is bright as long as we keep performing on the big stage, Niall said.         
	Younger brother Kevin, who too played a big hand, remained unbeaten on 39, one less than Niall.         
	On the eve of the match, Kevin had been worried about his form and the elder brothers advice had been: The past doesnt matter... Its how you perform on the day.         
	Ireland captain William Porterfield (who won the toss and inserted Bangladesh) remarked that his team would enjoy the moment and, then, prepare to face the defending champions.         
	Team India, meanwhile, had an optional training session on Monday morning.

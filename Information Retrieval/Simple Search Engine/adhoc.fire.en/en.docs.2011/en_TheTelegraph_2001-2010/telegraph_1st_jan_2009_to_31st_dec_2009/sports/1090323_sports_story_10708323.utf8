The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We can learn from Sachin: Moles
                                                   We can learn from Sachin: Moles
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hamilton: New Zealand coach Andy Moles is of the view that the defeat in the first Test against India was a learning curve for his inexperienced side.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On the upcoming Test         
	We know we didnt do the basics well enough. Thats a good point to start from. We just didnt bat long enough in pairs; we didnt bowl well enough in pairs. Something we pride ourselves on is our fielding, but we were disappointing in that, too.         
	On changes, if any, in the side         
	Jeet (Jeetan Patel) will come back; he is doing well in his game. We will obviously need cover for Flynny (Daniel Flynn)  he has got a bruised left hand, and also for Brien who has got bit of a side strain. We hope he will be all right. Jacob Oram is a world-class player. I am sure he will come into the picture.         
	What can your batsmen learn from Sachin Tendulkar?         
	Massive. Its all about making sure we bat for long periods of time. Sachin showed that. In earlier parts of his innings, by his own admission, he wasnt fluent, but he got through those difficult times. As he got in, it got easier. Age-old theory, the longer you bat the easier it gets.         
	The Napier wicket         
	I believe they have moved the wicket 2-3 feet, so its half on the original wicket and half on the surface where the one-dayer was played. Groundsman is confident it will be a good wicket.

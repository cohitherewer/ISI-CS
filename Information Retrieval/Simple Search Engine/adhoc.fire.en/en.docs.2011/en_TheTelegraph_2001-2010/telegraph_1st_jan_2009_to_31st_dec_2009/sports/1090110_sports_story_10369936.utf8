                                                   Will stick to my game: Somdev
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Somdev Dev Varman says he is not worried about being labelled a slugger, rather he is happy playing to his strengths  a solid baseline game built on strong ground strokes and quick court coverage. On Friday, after registering his second successive top-50 victory, Somdev spoke to the media about his game and ambition.               
	Following are excerpts         
	On his win over Ivo Karlovic         
	Yesterdays win (over Moya) gave me the confidence. The most important thing for me to do against such a strong server was to take care of my own serve. I did that exceptionally well ... I hope it (the win) means a lot to the kids growing up in India, hope it can inspire them and help Indian tennis.         
	On his own performance         
	When it comes to playing such players, it is a huge mental game. I was happy because I competed well today. To stay solid from the baseline and win the rallies has a lot to do with competing.         
	On success in such a short time         
	Yeah, it really worries me. (Laughs) No, I am just kidding. It feels good. I have worked really hard on my game. I never put a number on my game. I will stick to my game  It has helped me so far.         
	On the crowd support         
	I have seen 200-300 watching my game, but to come back (to India) and see a thousand of them cheering for me was a humbling experience. To see that kids are looking up to me and people feeling the way they are doing for me, I want to enjoy it. Its very special.

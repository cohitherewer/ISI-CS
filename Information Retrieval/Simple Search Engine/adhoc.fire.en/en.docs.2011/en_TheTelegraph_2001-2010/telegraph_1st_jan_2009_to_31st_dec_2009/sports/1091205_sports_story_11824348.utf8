The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Why no referrals, asks Bayliss
                                                                                                                       7                                      Why no referrals, asks Bayliss
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Sri Lanka coach Trevor Bayliss admitted at a news conference Friday that the only way to stop Virender Sehwag was to have 20 fielders on the ground.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On the referral system not being used in India-Sri Lanka series         
	When the ICC had said that it should be used after October 1, no ones explained to us yet why its not being used here when its being used everywhere else.         
	Was it right to have batted first         
	I thought we batted very well on day one, probably lost a few wickets more than what we would have liked to.         
	The Sehwag factor         
	The guys tried many things  different field placements, bowling on different sides of the wicket Wherever they put the ball he was skilful enough to put those away into the gaps. It was one of those days when you needed 20 fielders out there!         
	Plans for Saturday         
	We are looking up to our three big players. Everyone will have to stand up, especially the Nos 3, 4 and 5.         
	Muralidharans show         
	He realises that if you stick to your guns and keep trying hard, the rewards can come your way.         
	Sri Lankas chances         
	Victory just doesnt look right at the moment. If our top order can get us off to a good start and bat for a long time, there is no reason why we cant score 400 in a day tomorrow (Saturday). India chasing 150 on a wearing wicket is probably the best we could hope for at this stage.

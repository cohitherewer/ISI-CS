The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Daniel Vettori: We were outplayed in all aspects
                                                   Daniel Vettori: We were outplayed in all aspects
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hamilton: New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori was a dejected man after the ten wicket loss to India in the first Test. Conceding that they had been outplayed by an Indian team that is at the top of its game, Vettori said the Black Caps required all-round improvement without which their chances in the remainder of the series too were bleak.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On the loss         
	I think we were outplayed in all three facets of the game. If we look back to the start and, the situation we put ourselves in at 60 for 6, we recovered moderately from there. In every aspect India just showed us how to do it in this Test match. Even our fielding, which is something we normally pride ourselves on, was disappointing. Dropped catches always hurt and our ground fielding was poor as well. So a lot of things we need to quickly improve on if we are going to have a chance at Napier.         
	The areas in which they were found wanting         
	It is the longevity with ball and bat. Obviously, we have to bat longer. 80 overs in both innings is just not acceptable. We need to bat at least 120 overs. Then with the ball, we just got to be consistent in putting it in the right areas. At times we built pressure up to six to ten balls and then we let it slip and bowled the boundary balls.         
	On the batting         
	This was a chance for a couple of guys to step up and make a name for themselves. It was good batting conditions. It was a true test of your character and what you are as a batsman. But we just had two 50-run partnerships in the whole innings. Compare it to the way India batted in the first innings, there were at least five or six. We never created the momentum and never gave ourselves the opportunity.         
	On McCullum         
	We expected Kyle still to be able to do a job. It is unfortunate that he got out to the last ball of the game yesterday (Friday). But there is still an opportunity for us to bat better as Brendon (McCullum) showed in this innings.         
	The chances they had         
	There were small pockets of opportunities for us throughout the game to dismiss India for about 350, which we were never able to do. And to put ourselves in a position of 60 for six means it is tough to get back from there. India are a quality side and they showed it throughout this Test match.         
	On their fifth place in the rankings         
	In the past we have struggled as a Test side as there are elements to it. We havent played as many Test matches as possibly we would have liked. But in the last year or so, we have turned that around and played a lot of cricket. There is still a lot of inexperience within the group.         
	On Jacob Orams absence         
	Jacob brings so much to the table. He has got five Test centuries. There is nobody else who could say that going around domestic cricket at the moment. He is also a very good bowler. So we miss a bit, but he is probably quite ready. It will be interesting to see how he goes in the four-day game which started today. I am sure the selectors will be watching closely.         
	If he has got batting form under his belt, then that would be good enough for me to have him bowl just 10-12 overs. Jesse (Ryder) also has been able to do that for us, so the two of them could come together quite nicely as a fourth or fifth seamer.         
	On the wicket         
	It was really a good deck. If you bowled in the right areas you always got something out of it. We saw at times that the ball obviously dominated the bat on the first morning. From then on it was still tricky. There was an occasional ball which was tough to keep out. We were always looking for a wicket which had some pace in it, but this is a really good Test wicket.

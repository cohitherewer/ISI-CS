                                                   AIFF unaware of Dhorasoo angle 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Vikas Dhorasoo, the former French international footballer of Indian origin, is likely to be associated with Fifas Win in India and with India project. The AIFF, though, seems to be in the dark about any such likelihood.         
	An AIFF official, when asked to comment on Dhorasoos possible involvement in the Fifa project said that no information regarding this had reached them.         
	We have no information about it, said an AIFF official.         
	In an interview on the Fifa website, Dhorasoo said he met the officials of the world governing body in Zurich last week to discuss his role in the project, launched by Fifa president Sepp Blatter in 2007.         
	Ive got a footballing project in India on the go. We felt there was a desire from the world of football and Fifa in particular to turn its focus towards this country. So I wanted to meet the people in Zurich to see how we can work together on this project, Dhorasoo said. Dhorasoo, who played the 2006 World Cup, has donned the colours of top clubs like Bordeaux, AC Milan and Paris Saint Germain.

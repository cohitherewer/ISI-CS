The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We need to go all out, says Ranadeb
                                                                                                                       7                                        We need to go all out, says Ranadeb
            A STAFF REPORTER            Ranadeb Bose                           
	Calcutta: Sitting in the Bengal dressing room after a dream spell, it must have been frustrating for Ranadeb Bose to see the abject capitulation of his teammates in the second innings. The lanky pacer, however, wants to put aside the disappointment and go all out for a second five-wicket haul.         
	I am in no mood to enjoy the five-wicket haul as the match is not over yet. We still have to get eight wickets. The wicket wont help as much as it did on the first two days. Remember, lightning doesnt strike twice. Uttar Pradesh cant be bowled out for 62 again. But we have to win this match, Bose told over phone from Kanpur.         
	Asked how he would rate this five-wicket haul, he replied: It would be right up there with some of my best efforts. I would rate this effort at par with my seven wickets against Hyderabad in the 2006-07 season. In fact, this UP team has better batsmen like Mohammed Kaif and Shiva Kant Shukla.         
	So it is more satisfying. I must give credit to Sourav Sarkar and Laxmi also. They kept up the pressure from the other end.         
	Having already bagged six wickets in the match, Ranadebs first-class tally has gone up to 293 wickets. Asked about the feeling of nearing the milestone of 300 wickets, he said: Feels good to know that I have been able to be consistent for a long time. But I have reached a certain stage where these records dont matter anymore. I play for passion and pride.         
	However, Ranadeb seemed miffed with the criticism he received after indifferent performances in the last three matches. I have 24 five-wicket hauls in first-class cricket. Yet, there are a few people, who would time and again question my commitment. I must admit that these jealous people do not bother me anymore.         
	Just click on the net and compare my stats with some of the pundits who comment on my performance. If someone of Sourav Gangulys stature criticises me, I would take it seriously, but not those who have nothing to show for themselves, he said.         
	Captain Shukla, who had a good day with the bat and the ball, feels that they will have to get rid of Shiva Kant and Kaif in the first hour to make a match of it.         
	The pitch has eased out a lot. We have to bowl a disciplined line. Had our batsmen shown better application, the situation would have been better, Shukla said.

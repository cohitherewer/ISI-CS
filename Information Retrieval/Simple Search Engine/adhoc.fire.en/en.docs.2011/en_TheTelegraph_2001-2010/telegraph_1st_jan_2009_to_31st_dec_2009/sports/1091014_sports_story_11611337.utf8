                                                       Freddie tells painful story
                    Flintoff                     
	London: The injuries that hastened Andrew Flintoffs retirement from Test cricket were so painful that he often needed his wife to put on his socks and shoes for him.         
	Flintoff quit Test cricket after helping England regain the Ashes in August and is still on crutches following subsequent surgery on his right knee.         
	The 31-year-old all-rounder is confident of returning to Englands one-day International side when he regains full fitness and hopes his pared down workload helps him avoid the sort of debilitating conditions that meant his wife, Rachel, had to help dress him.         
	That happened quite a few times, Flintoff said. And thats why I think differently when people look at my Test career and say, if not for injury, I could have done X, Y or Z.         
	For me, a big achievement was just actually getting out on a cricket field.         
	That view contradicts that of many fans and commentators, who lament the lack of momentum in his career. Back, ankle and knee problems all restricted his impact, and he made it into the line-up for 79 of Englands 143 Tests over 11 years.         
	But Flintoff said he is lucky to have played as often as he did. I dont think, I missed this amount of Test cricket for England, Flintoff said. I just look back and Im thankful I played that many Tests. Ive had six operations in four-and-a-half years and two-and-a-half of those years were in rehab.         
	Ive been injured since I was 13. I had back problems all the way through. Even when I made my Test debut, I was in pain. So its some achievement. (AP)

            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: There is little to look beyond the two South India challengers  Sans Pareil and Star Bright in the 1,600m Casino Royale Goa Calcutta 1000 Guineas, the first classic of the season and the main attraction in Saturdays nine-event card.          
	Sans Pareils summer season form is impressive. The Burden Of Proof-Sans Eagle daughter was a decent fourth to Fleet Indian in the Mysore Derby after winning a Class II race. Young Suleiman Attaollahi trains the Vijay Mallya-property.          
	Star Bright enjoys a thin edge over Sans Pareil in view of having a dress rehearsal over the city race track. The Alnasr Alwasheek-Exuberant daughter, like all racing Baron MAM Ramaswamys classic runners, has been judiciously prepared and she looks to be on the up. A. Imran Khan partners the Daniel David-trained filly.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

	Star Bright: The benefit of an outing and her subsequent improvement tilts scales in her favour. Sans Pareil: Was a decent fourth behind Fleet Indian in the Mysore Derby after easily winning a mile race for Class II horses. Adriana: Also looking improved since her narrow victory over Gloriosa in the Fillies Trial Stakes. Castle Queen: Although not in the same league, her preparations indicate improvement.

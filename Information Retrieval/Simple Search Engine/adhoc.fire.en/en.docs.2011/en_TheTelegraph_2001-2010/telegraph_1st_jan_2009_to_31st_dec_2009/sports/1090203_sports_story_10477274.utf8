	Mumbai: An ecstatic Sania Mirza on Monday returned home, promising to add many more to the only Grand Slam she won alongside Mahesh Bhupathi in the Australian Open a day before.         
	Its a great way to come back, especially what happened in the last six-seven months, Sania, the first Indian woman to win a Grand Slam title, said after landing here with Bhupathi this morning.         
	Sania had battled a career-threatening wrist injury last year which kept her out of action for most of the season.

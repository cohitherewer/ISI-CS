	New Delhi: The Rajasthan Royals pacer Kamran Khan said captain Shane Warnes belief in his ability gave him the extra spunk that helped the rookie hold his nerve in the dying moments and deliver a sensational victory for the Jaipur franchise.         
	Kamran dismissed Sourav Ganguly in the final over of Thursdays IPL match when two runs were required off as many balls. The match was decided via a Super Over after it ended in a tie.         
	Before the final over of the match Warne asked me to bowl. I was stunned after seeing his faith in my bowling ability and agreed to take up the challenge, he said.           (PTI)

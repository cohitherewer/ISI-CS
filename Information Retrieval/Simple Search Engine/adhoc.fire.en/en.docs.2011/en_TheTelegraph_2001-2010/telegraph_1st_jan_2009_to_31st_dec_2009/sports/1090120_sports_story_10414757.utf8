	New Delhi: Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, who missed out on a place in Indias one-day squad for the tour of Sri Lanka because of a hamstring injury, said on Monday he would come back fitter for the subsequent series against New Zealand.         
	I am presently in Johannesburg, recovering from an injury, but will be back in India on Tuesday night, he said.         
	The off-spinner has been under medical supervision in Johannesburg for the last 10 days.         
	Harbhajan has been bothered by a tear in the bone joining his hamstring and groin for the last two years but the present window of no international engagement encouraged him to get rid of this physical discomfiture.         
	It was first detected in a scan during the tour of South Africa in 2006. It was then seen only as an inflammation.         
	However, in Australia last year another scan showed a little tear.         
	The doctors then advised me to keep on playing and treat it whenever there was a long break from international engagements, Harbhajan said.         
	Noticing a two-month window of no cricket in Indias international engagements, I duly parked myself in South Africa for treatment, Harbhajan said.         
	I have taken the last injection of the treatment and would be back tomorrow.         
	I was fit enough to play without break in any form of the game in the last two years and dont see any reason why it would be any different for New Zealand.         
	More so when I have taken the required medical help in South Africa, he said.         
	Harbhajan wasnt required to go through an operation to get rid of this nagging injury.         
	Fortunately, I wasnt required to go under the surgeons knife.         
	There is a medical process through which your own blood is extracted and injected with white cells.         
	Quite a few rugby players in South Africa have used this method of treatment.         
	Even Graeme Smith, the South African captain, used this process to recover from his injury, he added         
	Since that tour of South Africa where the injury first occurred, the feisty off-spinner has taken part in 40 one-day Internationals and 17 Tests, besides taking part in Indias winning campaign in the Twenty20 World Cup in 2007.

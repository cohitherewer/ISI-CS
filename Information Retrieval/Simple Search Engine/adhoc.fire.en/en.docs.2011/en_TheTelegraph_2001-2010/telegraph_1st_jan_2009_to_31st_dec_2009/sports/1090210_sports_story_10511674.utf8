                                                   England locked in a time warp
                                          GUEST COLUMN    Geoffrey Boycott      
	This England team seem to be locked into a time warp. They dont go forwards. They dont go backwards. They just stand perfectly still, while life moves on around them.         
	Look at the players who capitulated so spinelessly at Sabina Park on Saturday, and you will see that almost all of them appeared in Peter Mooress first series as coach back in 2007. Now I have nothing against continuity if a team are winning.         
	 But, correct me if Im wrong, havent England been getting their backsides kicked around the world for the past two years?         
	You cant even say they are in a building phase, because no progress is being made. Yes, Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff are still great players who would get into any side on the planet. When those two do well, England can look a decent outfit. But what about the rest of this sorry lot?         
	Alastair Cook still has the same technical issues outside off-stump that the Australians exploited in the last Ashes series. Ian Bell still keels over at the first hint of pressure. Steve Harmison still blows hot and cold.         
	And Monty Panesar still bowls the same ball six times an over. The one man I excuse from criticism is Stuart Broad, who does at least have a bit of personality about him.         
	If youre looking for an explanation for this strange state of suspended animation, I can give you one. These lads just have it too easy. There is no motivation to improve when they have more than a dozen backroom staff to analyse their techniques, put out the cones at training, and virtually wipe their bottoms for them.         
	Lets go through the entourage out here in Jamaica. We have Andy Flower (batting coach), Ottis Gibson (bowling coach), Phil Neale (operations manager) Kirk Russell (physio), Mike Stone (doctor), Sam Bradley (fitness and conditioning coach), Mark Garraway (analyst), Mark Saxby (masseur), Reg Dickason (security manager), Andrew Walpole (media manager), Colin Gibson (senior media manager), Hugh Morris (managing director) and Geoff Miller (chief selector).         
	I make that 13 people. And if they hadnt sacked him, we would have had Moores as well!         
	Old-time England teams managed to get by with a tour manager, a physio and a scorer. Back then, players were their own bosses.         
	If you had a technical weakness, you would come up with a way around it or get help from a senior player. If you were vulnerable to a particular kind of injury, you would try to strengthen that part of your physique. In some ways, I feel sorry for these modern players, because they dont have the chance to think for themselves and develop their own characters. How can they, when they have 13 coaches and advisers to plan out every minute of every day?         
	What the England and Wales Cricket Board are creating here is a comfort zone, where players arent allowed to take individual responsibility. Not only does all this pampering insulate them from the real world, but it gives them an inflated estimate of their own importance and ability.         
	I would like to see a return to basics. It is time that England started putting the cricket first, not the whole circus that surrounds it. One of the big problems of the last year is that everything we have heard about the national side has been to do with money and politics. Meanwhile the cricket itself has become almost incidental, which I find sad.         
	We have had the Stanford million-dollar challenge, the arguments over appearing in the Indian Premier League, the will-they-wont-they debate over going back to India, all followed by the sacking of the coach and captain. And behind the scenes, the players have spent the best part of six months wrangling about the details of their central contracts.         
	It was David Collier, the ECB chief executive, who instigated the Schofield Report, which was supposed to fix English crickets problems after the Ashes whitewash. Instead, it has only resulted in the creation of another bunch of jobs.         
	Its time for the 18 county chairmen to get a grip of whats going on, because none of this investment is actually making the team any better. Quite the reverse, in fact: Id say it is making things worse.         
	To take one example: out here in the West Indies, Miller doesnt have any official say over selection. Flower and Andrew Strauss pick the team, while Miller, who came up with the original tour party, is just keeping a watching brief. Somehow, they still managed to go in with only one spinner on a turning pitch. Things are not being thought through properly.         
	Englands chances in this series are not dead. But I believe that there is something fundamentally wrong with the way the team is set up.         
	Whatever happens over the next month, some tough decisions need to be taken at the top, or time  as far as England are concerned  will continue to stand still.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan, Chirag set for rumble
                                                     Bagan, Chirag set for rumble
            A STAFF REPORTER            Chidi at Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Their last clash, in the IFA Shield semi-final, saw 120 minutes of goalless contest, a skirmish  a headbutt to be more precise  which resulted in a red card and outcome was finally decided through penalty shootout.         
	So there is every reason to expect an exciting encounter Monday when last years runners-up Mohun Bagan face Chirag United in their I-League encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium. For the city rivals, it will be their first match of the league and each will try to garner maximum points taking advantage of the home condition.         
	On paper, Bagan appear to be the mightier of the two with experience being their forte. Brazilian Jose Barreto, who has been the green and maroons flag bearer for years, will be returning from injury.         
	He may well start, but according to coach Karim Bencharifa the ace striker may not play the full match. But with Edeh Chidi as his partner, the duo can prove handy for any defence in the country.         
	Also, making a comeback will be Ishfaq Ahmed, whose run down the flanks should augur well for the Bagan frontliners. Giving him company in the middle will be Marcos, Mickey Fernandes and James Singh.         
	The trusted quartet of Surkumar Singh, Deepak Mondal, Rakesh Masih and N Mohanraj will man the Bagan defence.         
	Speaking about the match Bencharifa said: The core of our team is the same and so I expect a good performance from the boys. Chirag are a good team but we are also one of the best in the country. But we will have to be careful not to repeat the mistakes which we made in our initial matches in the last edition of the league.         
	But Chirag have a balanced side with quite a few discards of the big clubs. Their latest recruit, Brazilian Edmilson from East Bengal, will add the required zing to Chirag upfront. Chirag, in fact, has turned into a Brazilian brigade with defender Eduardo Chacon and striker Joshimar being the other foreigners in their rank.         
	With a midfield which boasts of the agile duo of Lalkamal Bhowmick and Jayanta Sen, coach Subrata Bhattacharya may well fancy his chances on Monday.         
	My team is still not set and will require a few games to get their combinations right.         
	But I have a good side and will certainly go for a win. Its a long league with 26 matches and so I think the risk is worth taking, Surata said.         
	Shylo Malswmtluanga may return to the side on Monday and that would provide an impetus to Chirag forays. At the practice on Sunday, Subrata was seen asking his wards to make inroads into the rival defence down the middle.         
	Bagan, who had to be satisfied being the second best in both IFA Shield and Durand Cup, have let in a few soft goals with their central defenders lacking co-ordination.         
	It will be coaches battle on Monday as well as the veteran Indian and his Moroccan counterpart doesnt share the best of rapport and it will be interesting to see who checkmates the other on the field.

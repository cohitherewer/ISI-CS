    - Vashum, Odafe on target as Goans beat Mohun Bagan to win IFA Shield           ANSHUMAN ROY            The victorious Churchill Brothers players with the IFA Shield at Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: The first half had just got over at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday and already there was unbridled euphoria on the Churchill Brothers bench! Celebratory hugs, a rush to congratulate Okolie Odafe, spraying of water on each other. It gave the impression that Churchill had beaten Mohun Bagan and won the IFA Shield.         
	Churchill coach Carlos Perreira had to rush in to reign in his boys. Hey, we are leading just 2-0 and there are still 45 minutes more to go, he might have said.         
	Taking it to be the Churchill players arrogance would have been making a mistake. Nor were they mocking a disjointed and dispirited Bagan.         
	It was just that they knew they had the IFA Shield in their pockets. Even Carlos knew the job was done. But then the septuagenarian knows how not to make things so obvious.         
	When all this was going on, in the media box, Jose Ramirez Barretos frown was becoming deeper. And Edeh Chidi, sitting out due with a red card, was trying his best to hide the disappointment. The disappointment of watching his team outclassed, outthought and outpaced in the first 45 minutes.         
	Yes! Those 45 minutes decided the IFA Shield in the Goans favour. Those 45 minutes decided why Okolie Odafe commands a fee of over Rs 1 crore and why the likes of Ogba Kalu, R. Vashum and Khanthang Paite are on the wish list of every coach before every season.         
	Two goals  one in the 41st through Vashum and the second in first-half injury time from Odafe  were enough for the I-League champions to start the season with a title.         
	Those two goals in a span of five minutes just took the wind out of the Bagans sails. They had no clue about what had hit them and, by the time they realised, there was that half-time celebration on the Churchill bench.         
	Churchills dominance was so clear that at times it looked as if they were toying with Bagan. Vashum and Odafe were pushing the Bagan defence on to the back foot and the two wingers, Jaison Vales and Paite, were making life miserable for Surkumar Singh and N. Mohanraj.         
	Chidis absence meant that the onus of scoring was on Suraj Mondal and K. Kulothungan. But for the two rival central defenders  Gourmangi Singh and Rowilson Rodrigues  they were easy meat. Not once did they manage to break free. James Singh and Snehashish were kept under a leash by Naoba Singh and L. Robert respectively. Once though, James hit the post from close and Suraj did find himself in front of goal but his feeble header didnt trouble rival keeper Arindam Bhattacharya.         
	After the change of ends, Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa went for a double substitution and introduced Shanta Kumar and Subho Kumar in place of Kulothungan and Mondal.         
	Marcos was pushed up as the frontliner and Subho took a more central role. Suddenly Bagan looked purposeful but the Churchill defence kept its nerve.         
	Now, about the goals.         
	A long clearance from the Churchill defence and Odafe found acres of space inside the Bagan half. A swerve, out went Surkumar, a dodge left Deepak Mondal on the mat. But Deepak somehow managed to get the ball out of Odafes reach. But danger could not be averted as Vashum was lurking nearby. With Mohanraj and Rakesh Masih not smart enough to close Vashum down, his booming right-footer hit the back of the net leaving Shilton Paul stunned.         
	The second came when Silveiras through split the Bagan defence. Odafe zoomed past Deepak and rounded Shilton before putting it into the goal.         
	A minute later it was half-time and there was that unbridled euphoria.

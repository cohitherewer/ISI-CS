                                                   Kumble for 40-over cricket
                      
	New Delhi: Former India captain Anil Kumble is the latest to join the debate on the future of one-day Internationals and has suggested that the 50-over version be shortened to 40-overs-a-side to save it from extinction.         
	With the advent of Twenty20 cricket, the future of ODIs is in jeopardy. The England and Wales Cricket Board recently scrapped a 50-over competition from its domestic calendar in 2010.         
	I dont think ODIs are going to get extinct, but there is a little bit of threat on the development of the format. You need such innovations as Sachin (Tendulkar) suggested but my thought is to shorten ODIs from 50 to 40 overs, Kumble said Friday night on the sidelines of a fashion show here.         
	Tendulkar recently suggested that to infuse new life into ODIs, the format should be split into four innings of 25 overs a side.

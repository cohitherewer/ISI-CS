The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karim surprised
                                                                                                                                   Karim surprised
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Weakness in the aerial duels cost his team dear against Mumbai FC, felt Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa.         
	Our players simply didnt match up to their aerial prowess which was a disadvantage, said Karim after the 1-2 loss Monday. The result is disappointing and surprising We shouldnt have conceded the goals the way we did. We lost out on an opportunity to go to the top, he added.         
	He also termed keeper Sangram Mukherjees injury as unfortunate.         
	Karims counterpart, Khaleed Jamil said he was happy on winning an away tie against a big team. Its the best win of my career. Our team is mostly made up of under-23 players and we didnt get enough time to practice. So, its a quite creditable performance.

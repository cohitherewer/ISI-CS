The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Experts not star-struck, go by book 
                                                   Experts not star-struck, go by book 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Serena Williams ugly outburst towards a lineswoman that sealed her defeat in the semi-finals of the US Open against Kim Clijsters has opened up a debate.         
	Would such an action be possible in India? Would our umpires and referees dare to take such a drastic step against our sporting heroes? Can a Leander Paes or a Bhaichung Bhutia suffer a similar fate on their home turf?         
	Most experts feel chair umpire Louise Engzell, and Brian Earley, the tournament referee, went by the rule book on Sunday and its the same everywhere.         
	The identity of the player is immaterial during such circumstances. You always go by the rule book, says referee Joy Mukherjee, who is an ITF white badge holder and has officiated in the World Doubles Championship and the Chennai Open.         
	Would he have gone ahead with such a decision against say Leander Paes in the doubles final of an ATP event in India?         
	Look, both the players and the officials are professionals . No official thinks about a players identity in such a pressure situation. The umpire always trusts his eyes, Mukherjee explained.         
	Former Davis Cupper Akhtar Ali is not ready to accept such logic.         
	Lets be honest No Indian umpire can ever take such a decision because they dont have the guts, Ali said.         
	But he has no sympathy for Serena. Shes been talking too much Its certainly not the right behaviour, Ali said.         
	A point made by former Davis Cup captain Naresh Kumar. Serena just got carried away. It was bad behaviour on her part. The referee was forced to take such a decision.         
	You cannot blame the officials. They went by the rules Its not a matter of guts. Serena had already got a warning and the rule book specifies that you lose a point the second time. That it proved to be her match point was sheer bad luck.         
	The referee went by the rule book Its not a matter of guts or anything. Its the same everywhere, explained Naresh.         
	Milan Dutta, who is a Fifa badge holder referee, says individual allegiance never comes in the wake of decision making.         
	What if he is, say Bhutia? What if he is an icon in the eyes of millions? If he has done a wrong, he has to face the consequences. The circumstances dont matter, Dutta said.         
	The referee will always go by the rules. The decision may not always please supporters but that is the way things happen in a professional set-up.         
	Its the same with cricket. Umpire Aloke Bhattacharya, who has officiated in three one-day Internationals, feels theres no room for error in todays world where every move is scrutinised .         
	If Sourav Ganguly has violated the Code of Conduct he has to face the consequences. Even if I dont report the incident, the Match Referee would certainly have seen it on TV. He would ask me as to why I havent reported the same said Bhattacharya.         
	From a personal point of view, I wouldnt also like to earn a bad name in an effort to please anyone. Moreover, you cant escape the media glare, he added.

                                                   Sachin blows Black Caps away
                      
	Christchurch: Sachin Tendulkar smashed a breathtaking 163 (retired hurt) to set up Indias thumping 58-run win over New Zealand in the third one-dayer to give the visitors an unassailable 2-0 lead in the five-match series on Sunday.         
	Stand-in New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum won the toss and put India to bat. A vintage Sachin Tendulkar scored his 43rd century, which is his maiden ODI hundred in New Zealand, to guide India to an intimidating 392 for four.         
	New Zealand made a strong reply with the pair of McCullum (71) and Jesse Ryder (105) stitching a 166-run partnership for the opening wicket before losing way in the middle overs.         
	The home team were shot out for 334 in the 45.1 overs. They will now have to win the remaining two matches, on Wednesday (March 11) at Hamilton and on Saturday (March 14) at Auckland, if they are to square the series.         
	Big hitting by Ryder and McCullum, along with some lethargic fielding by the Indians meant that the home side raced to 166 for no loss in the 22nd over. But once the openers returned to the hut the hosts middle order collapsed to 218 for seven in the 34th over.         
	Kyle Mills (54) and Tim Southee put up a brief resistance by sharing an 83-run partnership for the ninth wicket before the inevitable happened. Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan and Yuvraj Singh took two wickets each.         
	Stand-in captain McCullum feels the loss could have been avoided had Ryder and he continued in the middle for another 10 overs.         
	We knew we had to get off to a good start. Once Jesse (Ryder) and I put on 100, it started to seem if we could put another 100 on top of that we would have a chance. But it wasnt to be, McCullum said.         
	A couple of run-outs is always frustrating. If Jesse and I had been going on for another 10 overs, the game may have panned out a little bit differently. You had to be aggressive from ball one, but we werent accurate enough with the bat in those middle stages, rued McCullum, who led in the absence of captain Daniel Vettori.         
	Tendulkar, whose previous best in New Zealand had been an 84 in Dunedin in March 1992, displayed sublime touch, hitting 16 fours and five sixes in 133 balls before retiring hurt in the 45th over.         
	At one time, it looked like Tendulkar would get past his own best innings of 186 against New Zealand in Hyderabad in November 1999  and even Pakistani Saeed Anwars all time highest score of 193 seemed under threat.         
	Playing in his 425th match, the master batsman, who hit his last century (117 not out) in Sydney against Australia in March last year, shared a quickfire 138 runs partnership off 100 balls for the third wicket with Yuvraj Singh, who made a brilliant 60-ball 87.         
	The Indians hit 18 sixes in the innings to equal the world record.         
	With captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni chipping in with a 58-ball 68 and Suresh Raina contributing an 18-ball 38, which included five sixes, the Indians posted their second highest ODI total, the best being the 413 they made against Bermuda in the 2007 World Cup. Dhoni was given a stumping reprieve by Peter McGlashan off Jeetan Patel when he had made barely five.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rohit Sharma hopes the good times will follow
                                                     Rohit Sharma hopes the good times will follow
  - Its a relief that I didnt have to undergo surgery on my shoulder       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                Rohit Sharma                            
	Bangalore: Till a few months ago, young Rohit Sharma was being hailed by just about everybody. Today, hes out of the India squad and, as luck would have it, even injured.         
	I suppose what happens is for the best only... Dropped, injured... The bad times have come in a rush, which augurs well for the future... I suppose the good times will definitely follow, Rohit told The Telegraph on Friday.         
	Moving about with his left arm in a sling, he added: Its a relief that I didnt have to undergo surgery on my shoulder... I didnt fall as badly as Zaheer Khan did (during the IPLs second edition), and Im younger (by eight years) than him, otherwise I would have been forced off all forms of cricket for a long time.         
	Rohit suffered a double tear while turning out for the Mumbai Cricket Association XI against the TNCA XI in the Buchi Babu last week.         
	Im undergoing rehab at the NCA here and, right now, cant put a date on my return to full-fledged cricket... Of course, Id love to make myself available for the (October 1-5) Irani Trophy, which is a big tournament for those not playing for the country... Right now, it seems 50-50, he said.         
	Given Rohits determination, he may not be out of the Team India dressing room for too long.         
	Zaheer, who underwent surgery in South Africa, could be off cricket till the end of this year. His last India appearance was in the World T20, in England.

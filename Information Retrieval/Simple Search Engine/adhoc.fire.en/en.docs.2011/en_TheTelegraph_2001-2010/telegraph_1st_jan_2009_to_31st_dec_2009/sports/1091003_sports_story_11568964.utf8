                                                   Bhaichung seeks crowd support
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Pune: Pune FC maybe the hosts against East Bengal in their I-League encounter on Saturday, but it may well be Bhaichung Bhutia and Co. who would draw loud cheers from the stands at the Shiv Chatrapati Sports Complex at Balewadi here.         
	The reason: this is the native place of the Indian captains wife Madhuri. The countrys premier footballer expects the locals to make an exception and back him and his team  East Bengal  when they take on the I-league debutants.         
	It will be good for Pune FC if the locals back them in a big way But I know they will be supporting me tomorrow (Saturday), Bhaichung said after the teams practice session.         
	This is my first visit to Pune and I met my wifes family. Until now, I had not met all of the relatives; most of them are old and cant travel. So, I have been going around and meeting uncles and aunts, Bhaichung, who arrived in the city with the team on Thursday, said.         
	However, Bhaichung was a bit worried with the ground here. I have heard a lot about this ground But this time, its not the way I had expected, he said.         
	It (the ground) is a bit of a worry. Sure it is the same for both the teams, but if you have a good ground, you have good football. I think its not been used for a while. But its definitely not an advantage for Pune FC, which is sad.         
	 The star forward, however, was more concerned about the lack of a foreigner in the team. Having no foreigner is a disadvantage But the pressure is always there. Its going to be difficult, especially when they have Subrata (Paul) under the bar, Bhaichung said.         
	He is the No.1 goalkeeper and it is important for Pune FC to pick players like him. They are going in the right direction, he summed up.

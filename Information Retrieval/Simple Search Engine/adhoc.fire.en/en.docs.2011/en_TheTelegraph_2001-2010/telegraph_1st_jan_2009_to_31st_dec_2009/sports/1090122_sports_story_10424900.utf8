The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bangla beat Zimbabwe
                                                   Bangla beat Zimbabwe
                      
	Dhaka: Roqibul Hassan smashed his fifth one-day half-century as Bangladesh raced to a six-wicket victory over Zimbabwe in their second one-day International on Wednesday, squaring the three-match series at 1-1.         
	After restricting Zimbabwe to 160 for nine, the hosts reached 164 for four in 44.5 overs. Roqibul was unbeaten at 52 off 100 balls. The half-century came after Mehrab Hossain Jnr struck 43.         
	Mehrab, who shared 32 runs with Tamim Iqbal, provided Bangladesh with a solution to their opening problems after he replaced Zunaed Siddique in the squad.         
	Tawanda Mupariwa earned the breakthrough when an in-cutter whipped off the bails of Tamim for 21. Edward Rainsford dismissed Bangladesh captain Mohammed Asharaful.         
	However, Mehrab and Roqibul steadied the innings with a 52-run stand for the third wicket.         
	Earlier, Sean Williams and Prosper Utseya shared a 96-run stand for the seventh wicket to help Zimbabwe recover from a poor start.           (REUTERS)

	Karachi: The Pakistan cricket team has proceeded to England for the ICC World T20 Cup without any of the players having undergone dope tests as has been the practice in recent times.

The reason is that we have already been constantly educating and informing the players about the anti-doping policy and regulations of the ICC, the official said. He pointed out that the Pakistan Cricket Board had conducted out-of-competition tests few months back and all the players tested negative.

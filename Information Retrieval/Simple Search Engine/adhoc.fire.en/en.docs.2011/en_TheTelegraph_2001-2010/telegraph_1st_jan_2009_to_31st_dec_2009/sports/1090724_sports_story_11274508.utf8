The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Emotions can wait: Freddie
                                                   Emotions can wait: Freddie
                      
	London: He will bid adieu to Test cricket in a few days but Andrew Flintoff is not letting emotions overwhelm him and all that is occupying the all-rounders mind is the unfinished task in the ongoing Ashes series.         
	There is no time for sentiments. I will worry about that when I finish at the Oval. Walking off for the last time at Lords the other day was special. I sat in the dressing room and had a look around and felt pretty pleased with myself, he said in an English daily.         
	It probably hasnt hit me yet. But in a few weeks, maybe when the lads are playing in South Africa this winter, thats when it will hit me.         
	For now I just want to focus on playing at Edgbaston and performing, he added.         
	The England all-rounder also urged fans to be patient and not start believing that they have regained the Ashes after winning at Lords.         
	We have won one Test match and thats all weve won. Its great and we enjoyed it but its now about getting ready for next week and we have got to perform as we have or even better, he said.         
	Flintoff also said that Australians are expected to hit back hard after losing the second Test.         
	The two sides are dramatically different in appearance from the last time we played in 2005 and I think they are close.         
	Thats what we might see over the next three matches, the series is obviously hotting up nicely, he said.         
	Taking on the captaincy in the last Ashes series, which ended in a 5-0 whitewash for Australia, Flintoff said he was glad he had a go.         
	When you get offered the captaincy youve got to have a go, he said.         
	In India, where it went well, I was playing well and anything that needed doing Id do it myself. When I wasnt playing well it was tough. Im glad I had a go, maybe it saved (Andrew) Straussy.         
	It might have been different. The right man has ended up with the job but maybe I took one for the team out in Australia and now Straussy can go about his business.         
	Flintoff, meanwhile, has advocated the need to cut down the number of Test matches being played to save the charm of the traditional format of the game.         
	We have seen in the past few years what it means to people and we have to preserve that for the good of the game and the tradition behind it because it is a great format.         
	The one thing we need to do to continue to maintain Test cricket as being special is cutting down the amount and make it a real occasion rather than playing one after another, Flintoff said.         
	Flintoff said it will be up to fans whether to see Test cricket or not.         
	The public will decide the future of Test cricket. If people turn out to watch Twenty20 and not Test cricket then it could happen. In England, we need to maintain the appeal it has, he said.         
	Flintoff also said that T20 format needs to be handled carefully so that it does not harm Test cricket.         
	It was interesting coming here today and asking the kids what form of cricket they like best.         
	They like the glitz and glamour of Twenty20, but maybe Twenty20 could have a knock-on effect so that players start with it and then work out how to play the longer form.         
	So it could have a positive effect but its going to have to be handled very delicately, he said.                   (AGENCIES)

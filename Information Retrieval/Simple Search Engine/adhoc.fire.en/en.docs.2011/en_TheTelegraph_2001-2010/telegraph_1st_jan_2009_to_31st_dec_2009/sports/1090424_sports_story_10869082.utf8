                                                   IPL refuses ICC help
                      
	Dubai: The Indian Premier League (IPL) has refused the International Cricket Council (ICC)s help to deal with the threat of match fixing and betting in the multi-million dollar Twenty20 event underway in South Africa.         
	The ICCs anti-corruption and security unit keeps an eye on international tournaments but with the IPL being a domestic tournament, the organisers decided to have their own staff to tackle any wrongdoing.         
	IPL opted not to use the ICCs anti-corruption and security unit, its a domestic tournament and theres no compulsion to use ACSU. Every event has its own protocol and the IPL organisers preferred to use their own staff, ICC spokesman Brian Murgatroyd was quoted as saying by an agency.         
	The issue of anti-corruption measures was one that was brought to the attention of the organisers of the IPL by the ICC ahead of the tournament, he added.         
	Haroon Lorgat, the ICC chief executive officer, said that Twenty20 cricket is prone to corruption more than the traditional forms of the game.           (AGENCIES)

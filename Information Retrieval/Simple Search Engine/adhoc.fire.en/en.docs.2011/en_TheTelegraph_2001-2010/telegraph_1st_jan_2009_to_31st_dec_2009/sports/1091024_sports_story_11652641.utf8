                                                   Surgery on Avik
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal all-rounder Avik Chowdhury underwent a critical spinal stabilising surgery to reconstruct his broken vertebrae at the Apollo Hospital on Friday.         
	Avik, who was shifted to Apollo from Ruby Hospital Thursday, went through the seven-and-a-half hour surgery, conducted by a team of surgeons.         
	Dr Subrata Sengupta, one of the associated surgeons, said: It was a successful surgery. The fact that he regained consciousness at the right time, post surgery, is a positive sign. He has been kept under observation in the ICU.         
	Dr Sengupta also informed that Aviks blood pressure and pulse rate were normal at the moment. He also stressed on the importance of the rehabilitation.

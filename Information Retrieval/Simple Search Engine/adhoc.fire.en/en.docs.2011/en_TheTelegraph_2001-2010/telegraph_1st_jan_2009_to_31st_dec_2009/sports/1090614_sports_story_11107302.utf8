                                                   Suranjoy ends gold drought
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Flyweight boxer Suranjoy Singh became the first Indian in 15 years to win a gold medal in the Asian Elite Championship when he clinched a narrow 9-8 verdict over Li Chao of China in the final at Zhuahi, China on Saturday.         
	The last time India bagged a gold in the Asian meet was in 1994 at Tehran when Haryanas Rajkumar Sangwan came up with a stunning show in the super heavyweight category.         
	While Manipur pugilist Suranjoy won the gold in the 51 kg on the final day, two others  Nanao Singh and Jai Bhagwan  had to be content with silvers medals.         
	Overall, India won one gold, two silver and four bronze medals to finish third in the medals tally behind China and Uzbekistan.         
	Suranjoys voice was still trembling with excitement when The Telegraph contacted him in China immediately after the medal ceremony.         
	It was an extremely close fight. That I could turn the bout in my favour was a great thing, said the 2004 Junior World championships bronze medallist.         
	After a couple of rounds, I felt the need of going all out. I was in an attacking mood in the third round and it did pay in the end.         
	The Chinese was a skillful boxer and was getting a lot of support from the home crowd, said Suranjoy, often called Pocket Hercules by his teammates.         
	Another Manipur boxer, Nanao Singh, wasnt as lucky as Suranjoy and narrowly lost to Thailands Pongprayoon Keaw 8-9 in the 48 kg summit clash.         
	In the lightweight 60kg category final, Indias Jai Bhagwan was comprehensively beaten 3-8 against Hudayberdiev Serdar of Turkmenistan.         
	Apart from these three, Jitender Kumar (54 kg), Vijender Singh (75 kg), Dinesh Kumar (81 kg) and Paramjit Samota (+91 kg) lost in the semi-finals to win bronze medals.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Jose Brasa                           
	New Delhi: A players mental sharpness is sometimes more important than physical fitness when it comes to getting positive results in international hockey, according to India coach Jose Brasa.         
	The Spaniard feels that, to a certain extent, India will have to adapt to the European style of play to achieve their targets.         
	The national team is currently training under Brasa in Pune before they embark on a tour of Europe starting July 24.         
	It doesnt matter whether you play with short or long passes, said Brasa, regarded as one of the best in the business.         
	What is most important is speed. And in modern hockey, the speed of the brain is more important than any thing else.         
	You have to get a grip on the proceedings before the opponents can, he added.         
	Brasa has no problem with the Indians playing short passes but he wants them to change according to the situation.         
	In India I dont know why players play so close to each other. I have no problem with that.         
	But India have some players like Dilip Tirkey, who can hit wonderfully and provide long passes. Maybe he can train other players also, commented the Spanish coach.         
	We cannot stick to one style of play. Thats dangerous because the opponent can catch you easily.         
	Under the present circumstances, it is necessary to change the style of play depending on the rivals, said Brasa.         
	There is no harm in learning good things from others, added the Spanish coach.         
	For me the tour of Europe is like baptism by fire.         
	We will be playing the best teams, including the Netherlands. It will be a great learning experience, Brasa felt.         
	India will start their campaign with four Tests against England, followed by two Test matches each against Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands.         
	The team will return to Delhi on August 24.

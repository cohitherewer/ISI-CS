                                                     Samaraweera, Malinga script emphatic victory
                  Malinga                     
	Colombo: Three wickets in one over by Lasith Malinga, backed up by Thilan Samaraweeras defiant century, gave Sri Lanka a crushing 97-run win over New Zealand on Tuesday in the opening match of the tri-nation series, which also features India.         
	Batting first, Sri Lanka recovered from a disastrous start to reach 216 for seven and later bowled the Black Caps out for just 119 in the 37th over.         
	Samaraweera made 104 and shared a crucial 127-run partnership with Anjelo Mathews, to give Sri Lankas bowlers a competitive total to defend. Like Sri Lanka, New Zealand made a poor start with the bat, losing their first three wickets for just seven runs.         
	Left-arm seamer Thilan Thushara made the initial breakthrough, trapping Jesse Ryder leg before. Nuwan Kulasekera had Martin Guptill caught behind by captain Kumar Sangakkara, and later also trapped Ross Taylor lbw.         
	A brief 30-run stand between Brendon McCullum and Grant Elliot gave the tourists some hope but Malinga struck three times in the 19th over to end any chance of a New Zealand comeback.         
	Malinga bowled McCullum with a yorker and three balls later, had Jacob Oram caught by Sangakkara. He then bowled Nathan McCullum with the last ball of the over.         
	Elliot top-scored for New Zealand with 41. Malinga was the pick of the bowlers, finishing with figures of four for 28.         
	Earlier, Sangakkara won the toss and elected to bat first, but his openers failed and the middle order crumbled under pressure as the hosts lost five wickets for 69 runs. Samaraweera then came to the crease with his team struggling on 22 for three and, despite losing two batting partners early, he settled down with Mathews for a record stand for the sixth wicket between the two sides.         
	Samaraweera, who faced 124 balls and hit 10 boundaries, has long been regarded as a Test specialist and had not been considered for limited-over matches for almost four years.         
	Nearly 11 years after making his one-day debut, Samaraweera chose a crucial time to score his maiden century.

                                                   Green light for ODIs today
  - Bigger buzz over BCCI secretarys appointment with SL President       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) are scheduled to finalise a five-match ODI series, with the latter as host, on Tuesday afternoon.         
	In fact, even the possibility of as many as seven ODIs being played cant be ruled out.         
	As a memorandum of understanding is a must, BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan is flying to Colombo for a meeting with SLC chief executive Duleep Mendis and the bureaucrat appointed by sports minister Gamini Lokuge as the bodys competent authority.         
	He may meet the sports minister as well.         
	One learns that three matches will be staged in Colombo, with the remaining two in Dambulla. Should the series be bigger, Colombo will get to host two more.         
	Team Indias tour could begin around February 1.         
	However, whats creating a distinctly bigger buzz in Sri Lanka is Srinivasans appointment with the countrys President, Mahinda Rajapakse.         
	The belief here is that the Arjuna Ranatunga-issue is certain to be raised by the BCCI secretary That too with the highest authority, a well-placed source told The Telegraph from Colombo.         
	Rajapakse had appointed Ranatunga (a Member of Parliament) as SLC chairman last January, but he didnt intervene when the sports minister sacked him a few weeks ago.         
	Since then, of course, Ranatunga (who isnt liked by the BCCI) has been trying to make a comeback. Rajapakse has given him a patient hearing, but made no commitment.         
	Apparently, Ranatunga has refused a deputy ministership. Hed rather have a second innings in SLC than take guard again as a deputy minister.         
	The BCCI remains wary of Ranatunga as Rajapakse may not wish to antagonise the 1996 World Cup-winning captain permanently.         
	Footnote: According to a BCCI source, New Zealand Cricket is trying to re-draw the itinerary for Team Indias tour (later this season), an exercise which should lead to a three-Test series instead of just two. Confirmation is awaited, but theyve been quite positive so far, the source said.

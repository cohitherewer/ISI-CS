The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Morton: Aim is to stay positive
                                                   Morton: Aim is to stay positive
                      
	Gros Islet: In-form West Indian batsman Runako Morton has enjoyed two good outings so far against the Indians. And the opener, who credits the batting turnaround to positive outlook, said he was looking to stay just that way.         
	It is all about dedication and application and backing myself to do the job. I aim to stay positive, he said.         
	I always like to think positive and since I came back into the team I have been looking to put my best foot forward for the team, he said.         
	I dont want to get too much ahead of myself. I am taking the positives from those two knocks. From the start of the year I have been feeling quite relaxed at the crease and I am getting the results, he said.         
	After winning the second ODI against India, a victory in which he played a big part, Morton said the hosts will look to replicate their series-levelling show of Sabina Park when they take on India in the third ODI at the Beausejour Stadium on Friday.         
	Aware that whoever wins the third ODI would be spared the ignominy of a series defeat, Morton said, personally, he would settle for nothing less than a win.         
	The series is level 1-1. As always I will be looking to win, he said.         
	For that, Morton said, his teammates would need to display the same zeal that helped them crush the visitors by eight wickets in the second ODI.         
	We will be looking to put in another good team effort as we showed in Jamaica. Players are putting their hands up and putting in good performances and we are confident, said the right-hander.         
	Morton himself has been in great form since returning to the side for the four-match ODI series against India.         
	In the opening match, Morton hit 42 from 51 balls and did even better in the second, hammering an unbeaten 85 off 102 balls at Sabina Park.         
	Otherwise a number three, Morton has effortlessly adjusted to the openers role in the series and he seems to be enjoying the job. (PTI)

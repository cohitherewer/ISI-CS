	The selectors, who met via tele-conference, picked five specialist batsmen, five specialist pacers, two spinners, two all-rounders and a wicket-keeper in the squad. Dinesh Karthik, who was part of the T20 squad for the tour of New Zealand, was also omitted as the selectors decided on a lone wicket-keeper in Dhoni.

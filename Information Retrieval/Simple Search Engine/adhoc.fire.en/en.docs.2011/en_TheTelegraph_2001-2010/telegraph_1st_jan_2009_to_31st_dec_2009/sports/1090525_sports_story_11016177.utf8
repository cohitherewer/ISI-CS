                                                     Shoaib, PCB on collision course
                  Shoaib                     
	Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar is on collision course with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after deciding to challenge a medical report that led to his ouster from the ICC World Twenty20.         
	Shoaib has already made it clear that he would be leading the Islamabad team in the National Twenty20 Championship which begins in Lahore Monday.         
	Shoaib is very upset with team coach Intikhab Alam, assistant coach Aaqib Javed and manager Yawar Saeed for not supporting him and believes that they conspired to have him dropped from the ICC World T20, said a source.         
	The 33-year-old was dropped from the squad after a medical panel of the board examined him for a skin infection and concluded that he was suffering from genital viral warts and needed to be rested for 10 to 12 days before another re-examination in the first week of June.         
	I dont know what he wants because we simply followed the advice of the medical panel of the board, Intikhab said. He made it clear that even if Shoaib played in the National Twenty20 Championship, he would not be considered for the world cup now as the board had already sent a request to the technical committee of the tournament for a replacement in Rao Iftikhar.         
	Pakistans chief selector Abdul Qadir and his colleagues are reportedly fuming at not being consulted in the Shoaib axing issue.         
	I dont want to make any comments. I will discuss this with chairman Ejaz Butt when he returns from abroad, Qadir said.         
	There is a growing feeling that the selectors have been bypassed by the team management which didnt want Shoaib in the squad from the start, a source said.         
	But apparently he could still make the squad due to some technicalities.         
	Look the International Cricket Council has made it clear to the PCB that their request for a replacement cant be considered until five days before the start of the World Cup, a source close to Shoaib said.         
	So if Shoaib plays for Islamabad and performs between May 25 and 29 then he can force the board to recall him and get them to withdraw the replacement request which has not yet been accepted by the technical committee , the source said.

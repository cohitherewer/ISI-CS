                                                     Kevin out of Ashes
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Kevin Pietersen at Lords                           
	London: Englands hopes of winning back the Ashes were dealt a serious blow on Wednesday when their leading batsman Kevin Pietersen was ruled out of the rest of the series.         
	The 29-year-old right-hander had surgery on the Achilles tendon injury which hampered him during the second Test and he has been ruled out of all cricket for up to six weeks.         
	Following a consultation, involving scans and testing, with the worlds leading Achilles specialist, Kevin Pietersen today (Wednesday) underwent surgery on his right Achilles tendon, the England and Wales Cricket Boards chief medical officer Nick Peirce said in a statement.         
	Kevin will look to undertake a comprehensive rehabilitation programme to ensure there is no risk of recurrence. This is expected to be approximately six weeks.         
	The operation involved a small incision and trimming of the blood vessels and nerves around the inflamed tendon and appears, at this early stage, to have been routine.         
	Peirce added: Despite conventional conservative treatments to the tendon with trial periods of rest and rehabilitation, Kevin continued to be in significant discomfort and is currently unable to run or even walk comfortably.         
	Pietersen averages 49.96 in Tests and his absence will make it harder for England to win the five-match series which they lead 1-0 following their dramatic 115-run victory over Australia at Lords on Monday.         
	Ian Bell will be the favourite to replace Pietersen in the team for next weeks third Test at Edgbaston.         
	As an England cricketer the Ashes are the pinnacle of the game so Im absolutely devastated to be missing the rest of this series, Pietersen said.         
	Up until now the Achilles injury has been manageable but it recently reached the point where we needed to look at other options in terms of treatment.         
	I hate missing matches for England and especially during an Ashes summer but now that the decision has been made to undergo surgery Im confident I can return to the England team injury-free following a course of rehabilitation.         
	The South Africa-born player spent lengthy spells off the field at Lords and was clearly in pain when running.         
	I was pleased with the previous course of treatment as it allowed me to take part in this Ashes series, but unfortunately the injury has recently deteriorated, Pietersen said.         
	To leave a winning dressing room at this time is heart-breaking, but it wouldnt be fair to the team or myself to continue given the severity of the injury.         
	Ill be supporting the team closely and wish them the best of luck as they look to build on the brilliant win at Lords and reclaim the Ashes.         
	Pietersen has scored 4,647 runs in 54 Tests, including 16 centuries, since making his debut against Australia in 2005.         
	His brilliant innings of 158 on the last day of the final match of that series enabled England to secure the draw which clinched the Ashes.         
	Pietersen took over as England captain from Michael Vaughan in 2008 but resigned in January in controversial circumstances after criticising coach Peter Moores.         
	He top-scored for England with 69 in the first Ashes Test but was widely condemned for the injudicious stroke which caused his dismissal and he looked uncomfortable during the second match when he contributed scratchy knocks of 32 and 44.         
	Hes our best player and so thats going to make it that little bit tougher for us, England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff said.         
	Hes going to be greatly missed. As a side, it sounds harsh but you have to move on pretty quick.         
	The 27-year-old Bell, a right-hander who averages 40.59 in 46 Tests, has been prolific for his county Warwickshire this season and will be the main contender to come into the team. He played all five Tests in the 2005 Ashes series but struggled against the Australian attack, making only two half-centuries in 10 innings.

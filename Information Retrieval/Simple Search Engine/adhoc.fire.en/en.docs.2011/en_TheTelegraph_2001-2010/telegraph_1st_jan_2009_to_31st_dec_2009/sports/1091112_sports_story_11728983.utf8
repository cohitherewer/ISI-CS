The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Greg lecture in Dons memory
                                                                                                                                       Greg lecture in Dons memory
            A STAFF REPORTER            Greg                           
	Calcutta: Former India coach Greg Chappell will be delivering the 7th Sir Donald Bradman Oration at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on November 19.         
	The public lecture, in the Olympic Room of the Olympic Stand of the MCG, has been thrown open for the cricket fans of Melbourne.         
	Crickets probably going through one of the most interesting periods in its history, Greg said Wednesday.         
	I lived through the World Series Cricket revolution but I think we are going through a stage now thats going to be more challenging for the players, for administrators and for spectators more than ever before, he added.         
	The former Australia captain plans to discuss the new challenge of having three formats of the game, and how that affects coaching and development. He also plans to speak on preparing cricketers flexible enough to play all the three forms.         
	Greg is not convinced cricket should be developing specialists, but sees it likely that some players will specialise in one or two but not three formats of the game.         
	The lecture is staged to honour Bradman and to keep his name alive with the new generation.

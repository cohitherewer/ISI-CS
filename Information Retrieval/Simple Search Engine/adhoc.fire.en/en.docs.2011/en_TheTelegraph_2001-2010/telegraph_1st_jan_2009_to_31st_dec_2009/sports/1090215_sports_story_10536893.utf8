            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Yuvraj Singh has moved to third in the Reliance Mobile ICC Player Rankings for ODI batsmen after a successful series in Sri Lanka, according to information forwarded by the International Cricket Council.         
	In the five matches of the series, the 27-year-old left-hander scored 284 runs at an average of 56.80 and contributed to India s 4-1 series win. As a result, Yuvraj has gained four places and now sits in the third place, just behind Australia s Michael Hussey in second position and India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in top spot.         
	It has been a good period for many of Indias batsmen with Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag also making good progress in the latest rankings. Gambhir has gained eight places and moves up to the 12th position while Sehwags recent good form has earned him a spot in the top 20 as he moved up six places to the 15th spot on the list.         
	Another big mover is New Zealands Ross Taylor who has put in some classy performances in his sides drawn series in Australia. Taylor has gained seven places in the latest rankings and now occupies the 16th position, level with South Africa s Herschelle Gibbs.         
	All this movement has not been good for everyone, however. Two of the worlds most successful batsmen, Ricky Ponting and Sachin Tendulkar, have both slipped in the latest charts. After a protracted period in the top five, Ponting has dropped five places and now sits in 10th position while Tendulkar has fallen out of the top 20. He is now 21st.

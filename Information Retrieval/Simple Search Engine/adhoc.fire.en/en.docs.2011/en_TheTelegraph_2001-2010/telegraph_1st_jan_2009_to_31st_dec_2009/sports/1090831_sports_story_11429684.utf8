The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | BCCI to pay IMG off
                                                   BCCI to pay IMG off
                      
	Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will have to shell out Rs 33 crore to the International Management Group (IMG) for the conduct of the second edition of the IPL, according to Board sources.         
	The amount for 2009 is around Rs 33 crore, sources said Sunday, after the BCCI terminated the services of the sports management firm.         
	The sources said the decision to terminate the relationship was taken by the Board at its working committee meeting held on August 13.         
	The decision was taken by the working committee as the members felt the BCCI was being over charged (by the sports management firm), the sources said.         
	Board secretary N. Srinivasan had written to the IMG that BCCI would not be using their services in the future. In the letter Srinivasan mentioned that the Board had paid close to Rs 43 crore to IMG in 2008.

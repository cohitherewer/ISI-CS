The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barnes holds onto lead as rain hits Open hard
                                                     Barnes holds onto lead as rain hits Open hard
                  Ricky Barnes                     
	Farmingdale: Third-round play at the sopping wet and twice-interrupted US Open resumed on Sunday, with no chance of a champion being crowned by days end.         
	It will be the first 72-hole Monday finish at the US Open in 26 years. More rain is forecast, but meteorologists have suggested to the USGA that it may be little more than a drizzle.         
	Play was stopped Saturday evening because of rain, and another 2.03 centimetres (eight-tenths of an inch) hit Bethpage Black overnight. Ordinarily, thats not much, but Bethpage has gotten doused so often in recent days and weeks that one brief downpour was enough to render the course unplayable.         
	Indias Jeev Milkha Singh missed the cut after carding a disappointing three-over 73 in the second round.         
	Ricky Barnes was leading with a record 36-hole score of 8-under 132. He was among the 16 golfers who never started their third rounds on Saturday, meaning he could have a very long day ahead of him.         
	Barnes got up early and was leaving for Bethpage around 1000 GMT Sunday, when he got the text message saying play  which was originally set to resume at 1130 GMT  was pushed back to 1600 GMT.         
	The third round re-started 6 minutes ahead of the USGAs revised schedule.         
	Most players started to arrive around 1400 GMT. Defending champion Tiger Woods, who was to start play in a tie for 34th and 11 shots off the lead, walked through the gate at 1419 GMT and headed directly to the still-wet practice green, a steely look on his face as he passed a couple hundred fans who politely clapped for the worlds No. 1 player.         
	Mondays schedule calls for play to begin somewhere between 1130 and 1300 GMT. If an 18-hole playoff is required, the USGA will hold that on Monday as well, provided it can begin before 2000 GMT, Davis said.

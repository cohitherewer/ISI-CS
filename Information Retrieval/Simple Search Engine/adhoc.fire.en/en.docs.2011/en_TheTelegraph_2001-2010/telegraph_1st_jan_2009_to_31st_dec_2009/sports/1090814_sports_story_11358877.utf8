                                                   BCCI seeks advice as the ICC calls panel meeting 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT AMP; A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Mumbai/Calcutta: The BCCI on Thursday confirmed that it has sought the opinion of the best legal minds in the country on the disputed whereabouts clause of the Wada code.         
	The BCCI has written to the government seeking the advice of attorney general Goolam E. Vahanvati and A.S. Anand, former chief justice of India, on the issue, a Board source said after the conclusion of the working committee meeting in Mumbai.         
	The Indian players, 11 of them including Sachin Tendulkar, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and women cricketers Jhulan Goswami and Mithali Raj, have refused to sign the whereabouts clause. The BCCI earlier this month endorsed their views.         
	The players said that the clause, which demanded the players to declare their whereabouts to the Wada three months in advance through the year to enable out of competition drug testing, violated their right to privacy which was guaranteed to them by the Indian Constitution.         
	However, the India government itself has adopted the Wada code, whereby the code becomes binding on every sportsperson, official and federation in the country.         
	The BCCI has also appealed to the International Cricket Council (ICC) to suspend the whereabouts clause. The ICCs special panel, formed to resolve the dispute, will have its first meeting in Dubai on September 5 and 6. The panel, which includes former India captain Anil Kumble, will discuss the cricketers concerns about the whereabouts clause.         
	Confirming the scope of the group and a date for the meeting represents a successful start and we can now get on with addressing the outstanding practical issues of the Indian players, ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said after a tele-conference among the panel members Wednesday.         
	All sides are committed to a zero tolerance approach to the issue of anti-doping and there was a spirit of co-operation on the call that augurs well for next months meeting, he added.         
	Wada director general David Howman also took part in the tele-conference, in an independent advisory capacity.         
	The panel  International Registered Testing Pool (IRTP) Working Group  chaired by Tim Kerr, also includes BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan, ICC principal advisor Inderjit Singh Bindra and Lorgat.         
	It was also decided that Wada will make an official available, either in person or by telephone, during next months group meeting.         
	The group also confirmed its terms of reference to address the BCCIs specific objections to the ICC anti-doping codes whereabouts requirements so that India players can obtain the necessary comfort to meet their requirements under the code as quickly as possible.

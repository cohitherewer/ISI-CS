The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bruce praise   for Becks
                                                                                                                                   Bruce praise   for Becks
                            
	Miami: David Beckham, booed on his return to the United States, has silenced his critics by helping the LA Galaxy to the MLS Cup final, his coach Bruce Arena said on Tuesday.         
	Beckham, who missed the first half of the MLS season while he played for AC Milan, was abused and taunted in his first game back in the U.S., a July friendly for the Galaxy against the Italian team.         
	The England midfielders return also coincided with claims in a book that he had fallen out with Galaxy favourite Landon Donovan and for a moment it seemed the entire season could turn into a circus.         
	The reason it didnt happen is because of the way David played and the way he demonstrated that he cares about the LA Galaxy, Arena said in a teleconference on Tuesday.         
	His performances quietened his detractors and I think, obviously at the Milan exhibition there were some frustrated fans ... but I never felt that David wouldnt be able to handle it, he added.         
	David has been through an awful lot in his career, he has played with some of the biggest clubs in the world and been through a lot of adversity as a player.         
	I think he was obviously well prepared to deal with any kind of issues that he was confronted with when he returned and lets face it he has done a wonderful job with that.         
	The Galaxy came through the playoffs with wins over Chivas USA and the Houston Dynamo and will now face Real Salt Lake in Sundays final in Seattle.         
	If the Galaxy win the title, Beckham would have completed a hat-trick of championship wins in England, Spain and the US. Arena said that it helped the reintegration of Beckham into the Galaxy team that the side had begun to gel as a unit prior to his return.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICL recognition appeal rejected
                                                   ICL recognition appeal rejected
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The ICC Saturday rejected the rebel Indian Cricket Leagues application for recognition, saying the Twenty20 event did not meet its criteria for approving unofficial cricket.         
	The ICC board considered an application for the ICL to be approved as unofficial cricket. The board went through the application carefully, including assessing it against the criteria within the ICC regulations for approving such events.         
	After due consideration, the board resolved that the application should be rejected, the ICC said in a statement after its two-day executive board meeting.         
	The governing body, meanwhile, left the fate of players aligned with the league on individual boards. In relation to the possibility of players returning to official cricket from the ICL, the board reiterated to members the importance of protecting the fabric of the game. A clear message needed to be sent that players could not swap between official and unofficial cricket at will. However, it was confirmed that the nature and scope of any sanction would ultimately be a matter for each individual member to determine, the ICC said.         
	Meanwhile, the board has invited former England womens captain Clare Connor to join the ICC cricket committee.

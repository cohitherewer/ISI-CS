The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB still hopeful of hosting 2011 World Cup matches
                                                   PCB still hopeful of hosting 2011 World Cup matches
                      
	Karachi: Even after giving up their claim to host the 2011 World Cup matches, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Friday claimed that the strife-torn country may still get to host some games if the security situation improves in the next few months.         
	We can ask the ICC to send a security delegation to review the security situation in Pakistan and if the situation has improved we can end up still hosting some of our matches at home, the PCB chairman Ejaz Butt said.         
	Butt, however, made it clear that the final decision would be with the ICC and the hosting of matches would depend on teams willing to tour Pakistan.         
	But we are hopeful because already the security situation is improving in Pakistan and it will hopefully get better in next five to six months, he said.         
	Pakistan were stripped of their share of 14 World Cup matches by the ICC in April after the Sri Lankan cricket team came under a terrorist attack in Lahore in which six policemen were killed and six players were injured.         
	Pakistan mounted a legal challenge against the ICC to get back the hosting rights and a final settlement was negotiated on Thursday after talks between Butt and ICC president David Morgan.         
	Under the settlement, Butt said Pakistan now has to withdraw all its legal petitions against the ICC in 15 days including the one over the shifting of the World Cup secretariat from Lahore to Mumbai.         
	We are in return guaranteed that we will retain hosting rights of our matches which will, however, be held in the other World Cup host countries. But we will be paid around Rs 1500 million as compensation by the ICC including the hosting fees for the matches, Butt said.         
	The PCB chief said it was a good deal for Pakistan although it was disappointing not to be able to host World Cup matches.         
	I think at a time when teams are not willing to tour Pakistan and India has frozen bilateral ties with us we needed this World Cup money. Because we dont want a situation where we have to go around with a begging bowl.         
	Butt also defended the decision to file a legal challenge against the ICC in the first place.         
	All the decisions were taken after consulting our lawyers. We took decisions after careful thinking and I think today we have emerged with lot of benefits from this dispute because of the fact that we challenged the ICC decision legally, he said.         
	Butt said that Pakistan had proposed hosting its share of matches at Abu Dhabi and Dubai but India opposed the move.         
	Simply because there is no clause in the World Cup agreement the ICC has with the host countries that allow the matches to be held outside the host countries, he said.         
	Butt lavished praise on ICC vice president Sharad Pawar, saying the former BCCI president remained sympathetic and neutral during PCBs negotiation with the ICC on issues pertaining to the 2011 World Cup.         
	Butt conceded he too subscribed to the popular notion here that BCCI actually ditched PCB in its effort to get back the 14 matches of the 2011 World Cup which were shifted out of the country on security grounds.         
	At first that thought came to my mind, but I can say with confidence that David Morgan and Sharad Pawar remained neutral throughout and were very helpful and supportive to our cause, Butt said.         
	Meanwhile, Butt said he, along with two PCB colleagues, will attend the September 2 meeting of the 2011 World Cup central organising committee in Mumbai.         
	Butt said he would be accompanied by Wasim Bari, the PCB director of human resources, and Subhan Ahmed, the general manager for international cricket affairs.         
	Butt, however, made it clear that Pakistan would not be nominating any member in the secretariat.         
	The reason is it will be expensive for us to have our people in the secretariat when it is based in Mumbai and not Lahore. But we will be part of the central organising committee, Butt said.         
	Meanwhile, Butt surprised by dropping the names of chief operating officer Saleem Altaf and the director of international cricket affairs Zakir Khan, who were initially supposed to represent Pakistan in the Mumbai meeting.

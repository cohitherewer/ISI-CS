            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former India opening batsman Wasim Jaffer, who has been roped in by Kalighat for the P Sen Trophy, said on Friday that classifying him as a Test specialist is a general misconception.         
	Its true that I have played more Tests than limited overs cricket, but that doesnt mean Im not comfortable with limited overs cricket. If you look at the last season, Ive scored quite a few runs in the Deodhar Trophy and the other limited overs tournaments, he said after practice at the club ground.         
	Jaffer was also of the opinion that playing the P Sen meet will help him keep in touch with cricket in the off-season.         
	The Kalighat officials had approached me. This being the off-season I agreed as it would give me some practice. I hadnt been practising in Mumbai and didnt get too many opportunities in the Indian Premier League either. So, Im looking forward to this opportunity, he said.

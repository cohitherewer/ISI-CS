The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England make it five in a row
                                                     England make it five in a row

	London: For the first time all evening, Fabio Capello smiled, clenching both fists in celebration as the final whistle signalled Englands fifth win in as many matches in this World Cup qualifying campaign. This was by far the most difficult evening that they have endured in this group but after a fitful display, his team emerged winners thanks to a late goal from John Terry, the captain. They beat Ukraine 2-1 at Wembley.         
	The perfectionist in Capello will find no shortage of holes in the performance, but the Italian is also a born winner, something that has begun to rub off on his players. This was winning ugly, winning when the chips are down and the match is not going to plan. It was a disjointed display that might have yielded defeat under previous regimes, but, having taken a first-half lead through Peter Crouch, they recovered from the setback of Andriy Shevchenkos 74th-minute equaliser to secure another victory when Terry turned the ball home after Steven Gerrard had nodded back a David Beckham free-kick with five minutes remaining.         
	It was not pretty, with Wayne Rooneys otherwise excellent performance marred by an ugly challenge on Oleksandr Aliiev in the second half that merited at least a yellow card, but five wins out of five represents a remarkable haul for a team that failed to qualify for last summers European Championship finals.         
	There will now be an assumption that victories will follow in the next two qualifying matches, away to Kazakhstan and at home to Andorra in June, but Capello will not allow such talk. He will insist on taking every game as it comes  a very English saying but one that was rarely put into practice by the national team until the appointment of the Italian.         
	If there is a persistent concern that Capello has had about this England team, it surrounds their ability or otherwise to perform in front of a demanding home crowd. Their four victories in five previous games at Wembley came against mediocre oppositions: Switzerland, United States, Kazakhstan and Slovakia.         
	So while Ukraine might not be regarded among the heavyweights of international football, they were quarter finalists in the previous World Cup, are ranked fourteenth in the world and are clearly a better team than any of those beaten on this ground since a deceptive 3-0 win over Russia in September 2007.         
	The opening exchanges were by no means encouraging for England. Passes went astray, with Ashley Cole the most culpable, and retaining possession was proving difficult against a Ukraine team who, conforming very much to stereotype, passed the ball well when the opportunity arose on the counter-attack. Capello, on the touchline, was wearing an even sterner expression than usual, but gradually nerves began to settle slightly, particularly after Crouch scored the opening goal in the 29th minute.         
	It was a well-taken effort. Frank Lampard floated a corner from the left-hand side and, after Terry rose highest at the far post to knock the ball back into the danger area, Crouch, inexcusably left unattended in the six-yard box, reacted with an agile right-footed volley that flew in off the head of Andriy Pyatov, the goalkeeper.         
	This kind of volley, leaning back, is a technique that Crouch has mastered over the years. So too, in his mind, is robotic dancing. He celebrated with an amused nod to the recent Comic Relief sketch in which he was urged to, ahem, get out the rope. The rope duly came out, albeit briefly.         
	That was the cue for England to start playing. Rooney, an exception to the anxiety that had briefly gripped the team in the early stages, was exuding the kind of confidence that will have Sir Alex Ferguson bemoaning the forwards suspension for Manchester Uniteds match against Aston Villa on Sunday.         
	At one stage, he hit a superb cross-field pass to Aaron Lennon and sprinted into the penalty area to volley the ensuing cross over Pyatovs goal. Four minutes into the second half, he let fly from 30 yards, the ball flashing just wide of the target.         
	Even after Valentyn Sliusar was ordered back into a more defensive role alongside Anatoliy Tymoschuk to try to contain him, Rooney remained rampant. The frustration for Capello was that few others were playing at anything like the same level as the No.10. Gerrard had his moments, most notably a whipped free-kick that went a foot wide of Pyatovs left-hand post, but there remained a slight lack of cohesion and there were some worrying signs on the England right, where both Lennon and Glen Johnson, the full back, looked erratic.           THE TIMES, LONDON

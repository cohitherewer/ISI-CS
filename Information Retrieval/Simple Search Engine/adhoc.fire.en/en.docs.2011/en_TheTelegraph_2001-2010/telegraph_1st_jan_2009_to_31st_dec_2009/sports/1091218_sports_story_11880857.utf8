The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvraj down with flu; Sehwag fit
                                                                                                                       7                                      Yuvraj down with flu; Sehwag fit
    - Despite defeat, Lanka counting the positives from Rajkot           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Nagpur: Non-stop cricket and criss-crossing the country continues to take a heavy toll, but the Boards just couldnt be bothered.         
	Yuvraj Singh is the latest casualty.         
	He missed the first ODI (Rajkot, on Tuesday) on account of a hairline fracture and, now, is almost certain not to play in neighbouring Jamtha, as well.         
	The Karbonn Cups second match is to be staged there on Friday.         
	Yuvraj has been laid low by flu and skipped Thursdays practice session. He hasnt been ruled out officially, but it would be the surprise of the season if he took the field at the classy VCA Stadium.         
	The good news, of course, is that Virender Sehwag, who hurt his left knee in the opening ODI, is available for selection. He went through the pre-match drills with no signs of discomfort.         
	Seemed to have enjoyed it, too.         
	Having beaten Sri Lanka the other day, even though by a mere three runs despite setting a target of 415, the advantage is with Team India. However, former captain Mahela Jayawardene insisted that his team did take a lot of positives from that loss.         
	Its not often that teams almost chase down a 400-plus target... The defeat was a bit of a bitter pill to swallow, but we still took a lot of positives from that and we gave India a good scare, he said on Thursday.         
	Clearly upbeat, Mahela went to the extent of saying that the absence of Muttiah Muralidharan and Dilhara Fernando, both of whom have returned home, wouldnt be a problem.         
	Injuries have, in the past, taken good players away from the team... But we didnt stop playing and didnt stop winning either... Its a great challenge for the ones whove come as replacements...         
	Mahela hasnt made the impact hes capable of, but felt hed been batting well.         
	Quick Lasith Malinga, who didnt play in Rajkot, has recovered from flu and is likely to make the XI. He should, then, come in for Fernando.         
	Assuming Yuvraj doesnt play, India may retain the XI which did duty on Tuesday. Theres talk that Pragyan Ojha could take Virat Kohlis place, but no decision has been made, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	Young Kohli, one may recall, had been made to bat after Harbhajan Singh in the first ODI.         
	According to locals, going by the past few days, dew is unlikely to be a huge factor.         
	As for the wicket, its known to produce runs in plenty.         
	But over 800 in a day? Not exactly that many.         
	Incidentally, while centres like Calcutta have to wait ages to host Team India, Jamtha will be staging its third game within two months!         
	The home venue of Board president Shashank Manohar has already hosted an ODI, against Australia, and a T20 International involving the very same Sri Lankans.         
	Well...         
	INDIA (likely): Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Ravindra Jadeja, Virat Kohli/Pragyan Ojha, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Praveen Kumar, Ashish Nehra.         
	Match starts: 2.30 pm.         
	Footnote: According to Mahela, one way of giving the bowlers (who have to deal with flat wickets in ODIs) some relief would be to allow an extra bouncer instead of the existing one only.

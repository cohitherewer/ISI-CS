The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Alex Ferguson snubs Tevez
                                                     Alex Ferguson snubs Tevez
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                               
	London: Sir Alex Ferguson does not care whether Carlos Tevez recovers from his knee injury in time for Sundays derby-day showdown with United because Citys best player  Emmanuel Adebayor  will not feature in the clash.         
	While Tevez has created all the cross-club headlines this summer with the acrimonious manner in which he moved from United to City, Ferguson has identified their Togoloese international as the main danger.         
	The 25million striker has scored in all four games as the Mark Hughes side opened their Premier League campaign with a 100 per cent record. Now though he is consigned to watch from the sidelines after picking up a three-match ban for his tackle on Robin van Persie last weekend.         
	I am not bothered whether Tevez plays or not  Manchester Citys best player wont be playing, said Ferguson. Adebayor is their star player, there is no question about that. He has scored in every game so far.         
	Ferguson repeated his assertion that City behaved in an arrogant and cocky manner when they displayed their infamous Tevez Welcome to Manchester poster in the citys main shopping area this summer.         
	The Scot is aware the derby clash has far more interest and significance now City are pushing for a place in the top four, having spent in excess of 120 million this summer.         
	However, he will continue to view Liverpool as Uniteds major local rivals.         
	To me, Liverpool has always been the derby, he said. It is because of the history. My aim was always to do well against them. It is hard for me to think any other way.         
	Meanwhile, Ferguson has said Rio Ferdinand is a major doubt for the derby clash.         
	The defender sat out Tuesday nights Champions League win over Besiktas with a groin injury and United doctors are not convinced the 29.1million player will recover in time.         
	If Ferdinand does miss out, Jonny Evans will retain his place, while Dimitar Berbatov and Darren Fletcher are likely to return but Paul Scholes will miss out due to the suspension he picked up following his dismissal at Tottenham last weekend.

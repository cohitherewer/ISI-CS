                                                   Lauda: Schumi is the ideal replacement 
                      
	Budapest: Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher, who retired in 2006, still has to be Ferraris first choice to stand in for injured Brazilian Felipe Massa, former champion Niki Lauda said.         
	Who is available? There is nobody available anywhere near Michaels performance. I was thinking about it, and there is nobody, the retired triple champion told reporters before Sundays Hungarian Grand Prix.         
	Schumacher, 40, Formula Ones most successful driver with 91 wins, hung up his helmet at the end of 2006 and the German has shown no signs of wanting to come back despite the occasional bike race.         
	Ferrari are almost certain to need a replacement for Massa after the 28-year-old suffered a serious head injury after being struck on the head by debris in Saturdays Hungarian Grand Prix qualifying.         
	Lauda, who came back remarkably quickly in 1976 from a near-fatal crash, said it could take two to three months before Massa could think about racing again.         
	He needs to take a decision, and for the whole business of Formula One, which is ill anyway because nobody is coming, he (Schumacher) would improve it by 20 to 30 percent interest, added the Austrian.

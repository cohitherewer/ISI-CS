The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Demand to lift Azhar ban
                                                                                                                       7                                        Demand to lift Azhar ban
          
	New Delhi: The BCCI is under pressure from the Congress party to revoke the life ban on former captain Mohammed Azharuddin for his alleged involvement in the 2000 match-fixing scandal.         
	Azhar, who is now a Congress MP from Moradabad, was banned for life after the BCCI found him guilty of being involved in the scandal. Azhars appeal is pending in the Hyderabad high court. But Congress leaders from Uttar Pradesh argue that the ban on the former captain should be lifted now because several other players, who faced similar charges, have been allowed back into the game.         
	In fact, some of these MPs, including Jitin Prasad, BCCIs finance committee chairman Rajiv Shukla, and actor-turned-politician Raj Babbar met ICC vice-president and former BCCI president Sharad Pawar Friday to put forth their demand. I spoke to BCCI president Shashank Manohar and he said that if Azhar himself is interested in wanting the ban lifted then it can be moved forward to the annual general meeting where a decision will be taken, Shukla said.         
	The ban on Azhar can be lifted only if the BCCI AGM deems it fit, he added.           (AGENCIES)

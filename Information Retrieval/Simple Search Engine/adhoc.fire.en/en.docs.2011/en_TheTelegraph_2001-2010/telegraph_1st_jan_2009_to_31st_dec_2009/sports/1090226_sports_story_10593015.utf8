	Bridgetown: England captain Andrew Strauss is confident his team can bounce back from a morale-sapping draw in Antigua and produce a series-levelling victory over the West Indies in the fourth Test which begins at the Kensington Oval on Thursday.         
	The West Indies remain 1-0 up following their opening win in Jamaica and two contrasting draws in Antigua, with the second Test being abandoned due to an unplayable outfield. (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rafa back in his elements
                                                     Rafa back in his elements
    - Gerrard says Reds can still challenge for title if torres stays fit           THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH            Rafael Benitez                                 
	The analysis of the denizens of the Old Trafford stands was a succinct one. Rafas cracking up, they sang of Liverpools manager. And after this the amateur psychologists might have a point. After watching his team score eight times in five days against footballs two most storied opponents, even the notoriously controlled Seor Benitez will be cracking up, with joyous laughter.         
	The managers instruction to his Liverpool team would have been simple enough: play like you did on Tuesday and you can beat anyone. And so they did. After Real Madrid another seemingly impregnable European institution fell to Benitezs newly rampant team: Manchester Uniteds Old Trafford record.         
	With victory, reckoned the visiting captain, came the possibility that others might do Liverpool favours. Its not very often you see Manchester United get beaten 4-1 at home, said Steven Gerrard. I hope this gives other teams that come to Old Trafford the belief that United can be beaten.         
	United werent just beaten. They were outsmarted, outmuscled, outpaced, subjected to the kind of rout they routinely inflict on the rest of the Premier League. When Andrea Dossena chipped Edwin van der Sar to score the visitors fourth in injury time, Uniteds fortress echoed to the clack of emptying seats, a noise that almost drowned out the delirious cackle emanating from the Liverpool followers of we want five.         
	Benitez was in his elements, standing on the edge of his technical area, yelling instruction at whoever came within earshot. He even permitted himself a brief moment to applaud Dossenas goal, before he pointed at Gerrard, then pointed at his temple. The message was simple: think, think and think again.         
	But for all his cerebral input, frankly, in the shape his main striker is in, his team needs no more instruction than to waft the ball in Fernando Torress direction. He will do the rest.         
	Captain Gerrard claims that ensuring Fernando Torres remains fit could be the key to Liverpool staging a late comeback to clinch the Premier League title.         
	Following Saturdays mauling of United, the England international has hailed the Spaniard as the best striker in the world.         
	Torres is magic, Gerrard said. It has been frustrating not having him for parts of the season with injury.         
	In my opinion wed be ahead of United if he had been fit all the time. I dont think anyone could argue with me that he is the best striker in the world.         
	If we can keep him fit now, it could be an exciting finish to the season.         
	In reaction to Gerrards praise, 25-year-old Torres, who has been suffering with an ankle injury in recent weeks, has compared his captain to AC Milan and Brazil striker Kaka.         
	Amid speculation that Gerrard has replaced Cristiano Ronaldo at the top of Real Madrids shopping list, Torres insists the Spanish giants have no chance of landing the midfielder regardless of the money they propose.         
	Paying tribute to Gerrards loyalty to Liverpool, Torres said: There isnt a team in the world that Steven wouldnt get into  so yes I am sure he has his admirers. But there are some players who love their club so much that they wont leave no matter what money is thrown around.         
	We saw Kaka stay at AC Milan and that was nice to see in these times. Like Stevie, Kaka is one of the best players and in the same way he loves Milan, Stevie loves Liverpool.         
	Its not about how we would get him to stay  he would never leave.         
	The fans love him, the manager loves him and he is our captain. Trust me when I say he is going nowhere.         
	Meanwhile, Manchester United legend Bobby Charlton hopes the humiliating defeat by Liverpool can prove a blessing in disguise.         
	With a four-point lead at the top and a game in hand, United remain firm favourites  and Charlton believes the shock loss can spur them on.         
	Talking to the BBC Charlton said: I think there was just a little bit of stress, because we kept on winning matches. It helps to maybe turn the gas down a little bit, and a lot of pressures maybe eased. Im hoping were going to do better because of this result.         
	It wasnt a result anybody at Manchester United could be proud of, but you have to say Liverpool played really well and deserved to win.         
	It was Uniteds heaviest home defeat since losing by the same scoreline to QPR in 1992, but Charlton has no doubt Ferguson will soon pick the side up.         
	He will make sure they get their confidence back, he added.         
	Its a bit of a blow  to let in four goals at home hasnt been done for so many years. Theres bit of pride been hurt there, but I dont think hell have to work too hard to rejuvenate them.         
	But work he will. Getting to the end of the season, all matches are important. When the next one comes along next week Im sure hell be ready for it.         
	Charlton, who won the European Cup with United in 1968, believes the current squad could go on to prove Old Traffords greatest ever.         
	He said: It is a very good squad with a lot of good players. I think maybe if they win the Champions League you could say that is maybe the best squad thats been here.         
	United might put this down simply as a bad day at office. But you imagine as the season reaches its climactic rush they  and Vidic in particular  will be desperate that the Champions League draw spares them an early reacquaintance with Torres. Suddenly there appears to be a major Spanish obstruction in the way of that quintuple.

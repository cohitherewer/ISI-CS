The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ronaldo to play himself in film
                                                     Ronaldo to play himself in film
                  Ronaldo                     
	Sao Paulo: Ronaldo is set to play himself in an Iranian film about a Palestine girl who was killed before realising her dream of meeting him.         
	Ronaldo has reached a deal to be part of the film and will start filming as early as September in Lebanon, according to officials at the Brazil-Iran chamber of commerce, which is helping produce the film.         
	Still without a title, the film is based on the true story of Alneyrab, a 13-year-old girl who dreamed of meeting the footballer when he visited the Middle East in a humanitarian mission in 2005.         
	She was only able to watch her idol pass through along with his entourage, and later was killed in a conflict in the region.         
	Ronaldos agent, Fabiano Farah, confirmed that Ronaldo has signed a pre-contract for the film.         
	The 32-year-old Ronaldo, who is thriving with Corinthians in his comeback from the third serious knee injury of his career, will appear in some scenes that take place in the girls dreams, said Farrokh Faradji Chadan, president of the Brazil-Iran chamber of commerce.         
	He is expected to spend only a few days in Lebanon shooting the film. Chadan would not disclose how much Ronaldo would be paid for taking part in what he called a humanitarian production.         
	Chadan said the deal to have Ronaldo participating in the film  which is expected to be finalised in 2010  was reached in June. One of the producers will be Mansur Sohrabpour.         
	Ronaldo has been a goodwill ambassador for the UN Development Program since 2000 and made a trip to Israel and the West Bank in 2005 as part of his campaign against poverty around the world. He was playing for Real Madrid at the time.         
	Ronaldo signed with four-time Brazilian champion Corinthians in December 2008 despite doubts he would ever recover from the knee injury sustained with AC Milan in February of that year.         
	After more than a year sidelined, Ronaldo returned to action in March and has already helped Corinthians win two titles in Brazil  the traditional Sao Paulo State championship and the Brazilian Cup.         
	He has scored six goals in his last four matches.         
	Ronaldo was a member of Brazils team that won its fourth World Cup title in 1994 in the United States, and was the teams top player when it clinched the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan.

	Cape Town: South Africa will likely need a little bit of luck in Fridays World Cup draw to have a chance of advancing from the group stage at next years tournament  the first to be played on African soil.         
	The hosts are one of the eight seeded teams but could still be faced with a group possibly including France, the United States and Chile in Group A. It could also get an easier schedule of facing New Zealand, Uruguay and Slovenia.         
	The draw can produce anything, World Cup chief executive Danny Jordaan said.         
	We hope on the luck of the draw. It is important for us as the host nations that our team must progress in the second round and we will keep our fingers crossed.         
	Fifa secretary general Jerome Valcke and South African Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron will choose the balls from the four pots to create the eight groups. With the exception of European teams, countries from the same geographical confederation cannot be drawn into the same group.         
	France are the highest-ranked team to miss out on being seeded, and could end up facing powerhouses like Spain or Brazil in the opening group stage.         
	I just hope that we wont end up in the toughest group, French federation president Jean-Pierre Escalettes said.         
	The toughest group possible would involve the French playing with European champions Spain, Cameroon and the United States. (AP)

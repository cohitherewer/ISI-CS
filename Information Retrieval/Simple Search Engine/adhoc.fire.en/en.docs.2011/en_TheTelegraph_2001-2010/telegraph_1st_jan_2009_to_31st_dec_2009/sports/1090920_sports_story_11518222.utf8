	New Delhi: The Bhaichung Bhutia-Mohun Bagan impasse is set to come to an end this week. The AIFF-appointed arbitrator, Amarendra Sharan, who heard the arguments of both parties counsels Saturday, indicated he would announce his verdict next week.         
	Sharan said he would take a couple of days to decide after both sides submit written replies on September 22.

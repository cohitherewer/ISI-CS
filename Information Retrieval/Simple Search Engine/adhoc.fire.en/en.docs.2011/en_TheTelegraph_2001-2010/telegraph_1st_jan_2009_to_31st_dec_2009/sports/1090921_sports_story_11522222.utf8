                                                   Indians struggle in practice match
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Potchefstroom: India struggled to get into the groove in the practice match against New Zealand here Sunday. The Champions Trophy begins on Tuesday and Mahendra Singh Dhonis men open against Pakistan on Saturday.         
	Chasing 302, India reached 125 for five in 26 overs. Yusuf Pathan (10) and Avishek Nayar (0) were at the crease.         
	Dinesh Karthik (20) and Rahul Dravid (37 off 34 balls) gave India a good start reaching 58 in an opening stand before the former fell to Daniel Vettori. Suresh Raina then scored 31 off 42 balls.         
	A middle-order collapse, however, put paid to Indias hopes as they lost wickets in a flurry. Dhoni (9) and Yuvraj (9) left in quick succession and that upset the applecart. Shane Bond picked two wickets.         
	Earlier, Neil Brooms fiery 66 down the order helped New Zealand rattle up 301 for nine against India.         
	Jesse Ryder and Martin Guptill scored half-centuries at the top to lay the foundation for a big total after the Black Caps elected to bat. Ryder, the left-handed opener, singled out Praveen Kumar for some special treatment and picked up six of the eight fours that he hit against the right-arm pacer.         
	Ryder also smacked Ishant Sharma for a massive six as he clobbered 57 runs from 48 balls with 10 fours and a six. Ryder received able support from the other end as Brendon McCullum (15 off 17 balls) and Guptill (63 off 79 balls) also lay about smashing the bowling, bringing up New Zealands 150 in the 28th over.         
	Indias spin duo of leg-spinner Amit Mishra (1/29) and off-spinner Yusuf Pathan (3/46) applied brakes in the middle-overs but did not get enough support from the other bowlers. Broom provided a bigger thrust in the closing overs, hitting 66 from 46 balls with five fours and four sixes.         
	In RP Singhs eighth over, the penultimate of the innings, he clobbered 25 runs including three sixes and a four.         
	As Mahendra Singh Dhoni had stressed on the eve of the teams departure, Indias bowling and fielding left a lot to be desired. The pace attack lacked direction and leadership in the absence of Zaheer Khan.         
	Even Wasim Akram had misgivings about Indias performance without Zaheer. Zaheers absence would affect Indias chances. At this level, experience does matter, Akram had said.

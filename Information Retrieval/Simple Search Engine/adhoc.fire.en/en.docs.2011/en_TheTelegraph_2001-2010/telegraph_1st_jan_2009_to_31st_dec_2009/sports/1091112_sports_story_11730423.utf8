	New Delhi: Far away from home, young Bengal cricketer Avik Chowdhury has resumed his battle to return to normal life at the capitals Indian Spinal Injuries Centre on Tuesday.         
	The arrangements here are excellent. God willing, Avik will go back home and play cricket again, said Aviks father Sripati, who has accompanied his son to Delhi along with a few other relatives.         
	On October 18, the promising all-rounder was put on a ventilator at a Calcutta hospital after being critically injured in a car accident. The accident occurred when the cricketers car rammed into a median divider on EM Bypass. Four of his friends were also critically injured         
	For the last two days I was busy consulting the doctors, said Aviks father. The system is totally different in this institution. Avik has been given a 10-week rehabilitation programme. After that the doctors will examine his condition and decide on the future course of action.         
	Avik, who is being treated by Dr. S. S. Chabra, a well known specialist in spinal injuries, is in fine spirit and looking forward to get back in shape, his father said. His level of confidence is very high, he said.         
	Dr Chabra has told Avik and his family members to have patience and not to rush things. Three of Dr. Chabras colleagues are also looking after Avik. They have told us that the progress will be monitored on a weekly basis. We understand the situation perfectly. We have full faith in the system here, Sripati Chowdhury said.         
	On Wednesday, union minister of state for urban development, Saugata Roy visited Avik at the hospital and met his family members. He has assured the family of all possible help in Aviks treatment.

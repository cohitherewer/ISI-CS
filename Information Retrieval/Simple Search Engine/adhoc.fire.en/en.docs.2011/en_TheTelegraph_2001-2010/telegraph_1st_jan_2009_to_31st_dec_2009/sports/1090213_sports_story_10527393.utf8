                                                   Got to remain calm: Strauss
                            
	St Johns: England seek to draw level in a Test series that they were favoured to win when they face West Indies in the second Test, starting Friday at the Vivian Richards Cricket Ground here.         
	England were upset in the opening Test in Kingston, where they were bowled out for 51 in their second innings and crashed to an innings and 23-run defeat inside four days to hand West Indies a 1-0 lead in the four-Test series.         
	The visitors face a crucial challenge in the match. Another defeat for England would give West Indies an unassailable lead in the series and end their nine-year spell of Test series defeats against them.         
	Barring back-to-back wins over Bangladesh, West Indies have not won consecutive matches in the last 10 years.         
	England should also recall that West Indies also outplayed South Africa in Port Elizabeth two Decembers ago, and they still lost a four-Test series 2-1.         
	If there were massive divisions in the side, I would be worried, but I do not think they are, England captain Andrew Strauss said.         
	I think there were some quality performances in the first Test, so its not all doom and gloom, but given what happened, we need to get over it.         
	We will need to re-formulate some of the plans in terms of how we play the West Indies bowling, and also some of our plans for their batsmen as well.         
	So there is plenty of work for us to do, but we have got to remain calm and hopeful. We need to make whatever adjustments are necessary individually to become better, sooner rather than later.         
	West Indies captain Chris Gayle admitted that a single Test victory  as dramatic as the opening Test was  will not be enough to satisfy his side, let alone their fans, that they have turned the proverbial corner.         
	Were not going to be lackadaisical for sure, he said. But we will not put any additional pressure on ourselves because the expectations are going to be high. People are going to be looking for us to go out there and do even better.         
	But we just need to play some good, simple, basic cricket like what we did in Jamaica. People said we batted too slow in the last Test, but patient innings really, really count especially in a Test match.

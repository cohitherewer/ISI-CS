	Melbourne: Mahesh Bhupathi and his Bahamian partner Mark Knowles advanced to the Australian Open mens doubles third round after a straight-sets victory.         
	It was, however, curtains for Rohan Bopanna and his Finnish partner Jarkko Nieminen who lost their second-round match here on Saturday.         
	Third seeds Bhupathi and Knowles had to fend off a tough fight from the unseeded Russian pair of Igor Kunitsyn and Dmitry Tursunov before winning 7-5, 7-5 in a 92-minute duel.         
	The Indo-Bahamian pair will next take on Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador and Tommy Robredo of Spain who defeated Bopanna and Nieminen 6-4, 6-4 in the second round.         
	Bopanna and Nieminen had advanced to the second round defeating the Spanish pair of Marcel Granollers and Sanitago Ventura 3-6, 6-4, 6-1.         
	Bhupathi and Knowles played near flawless tennis with no double faults and just three unforced errors to their opponents 14.         
	Though they had a slower service, the third seeds converted four out of nine break points that came their way.         
	Bopanna and Nieminen, on the other hand, committed as many as 16 unforced errors to their opponents 11.         
	Another Indian, Leander Paes, and his Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy, seeded fourth, sailed into the third round on Friday, defeating unseeded Italian-Croat pair of Fabio Fognini and Ivan Ljubcic 6-3, 6-4.         
	On Friday, Bhupathi, pairing up with Sania Mirza had stunned sixth seeds Kveta Peschke and Pavel Vizner of the Czech Republic 6-2, 6-4. (PTI)

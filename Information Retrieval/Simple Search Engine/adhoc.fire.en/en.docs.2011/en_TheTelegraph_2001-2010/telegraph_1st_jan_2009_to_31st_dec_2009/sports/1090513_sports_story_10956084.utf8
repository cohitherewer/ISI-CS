	Calcutta: Ace archer Jayanta Talukdar believes that an Olympic gold will change the profile of the sport in the country.         
	The soft-spoken 23-year old archer from Guwahati is currently training at the SAI, Eastern Centre for the World Cup stage III in Turkey.         
	In the last few years things have developed immensely for archery. We are competing with top class international players, winning medals and are matching them in every aspect. But I feel we need to win a gold at the Olympics. That is the only way the profile of the game will change in India Look how both shooting and boxing have changed after Abhinav Bindra and Vijender Kumar won medals in Beijing, Jayanta told The Telegraph on Tuesday.         
	Talking about his gold winning experience at the World Cup stage II in Porec recently, Jayanta said: I was not at all in good nick at the World Cup stage I. My fingers were stiff and I faced lot of problems It was a total disappointment. But I was determined. I incorporated some changes into my game and that helped me immensely in Porec.         
	Porec has always being lucky for me. It has never let me down and I have always performed well there. I think theres something in the atmosphere there It is terrific. Though it was a bit windy and chilly, the ambience was perfect. Winning gold was definitely a great boost for me.         
	While Jayanta beat Athens Olympics gold medallist Marco Galiazzo by 110 points to win the individual recurve gold, India bagged won a gold in the team event too.         
	Incidentally, the Steel Plant Sports Board (SPSB) archer, won gold in the 2006 World Cup in Porec, beating Galiazzo.         
	Looking to continue his gold streak at the World Cup stage III, Jayanta straightaway came to the city instead of going home.         
	You know the expectations are high now and I know I have to keep things going Win in Turkey too... Thats why I skipped going home and returned here. I want to keep the momentum going and practice hard. I am confident of winning there also, he said.         
	Talking about Indias team performance, Jayanta said: The team spirit is great. And the understanding is simply great, thanks to our long training sessions That has done us a lot of good and I am sure we will win in Turkey also.         
	Meanwhile, the Archery Association of India (AAI) Tuesday declared the 16-member squad for the World Cup stage III in Antalya, Turkey, from June 2 to 7.

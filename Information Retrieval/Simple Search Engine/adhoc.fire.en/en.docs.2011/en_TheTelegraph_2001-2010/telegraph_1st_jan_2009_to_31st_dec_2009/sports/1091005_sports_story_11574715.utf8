The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its a 50-50 final, says Clive Lloyd
                                                   Its a 50-50 final, says Clive Lloyd
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Johannesburg: Clive Supercat Lloyd, the iconic West Indian who transformed his team into absolute world beaters in the mid-Seventies, spoke to The Telegraph on the eve of the Champions Trophy final.         
	Lloyd, incidentally, is chairman of the ICCs cricket committee.               
	The following are excerpts               
	The Australians have been playing good cricket. In fact, they were outstanding in the semi-final against England... However, I wouldnt write off New Zealand... Theyve got nothing to lose and beat Pakistan comprehensively... Their captain (Daniel Vettori) has been doing a great job...         
	At the moment, Id say its a 50-50 final, with the team playing better on the day, crossing the line first...         
	Yes, I must accept that I hadnt expected an Australia-New Zealand final... Actually, before the tournament began, Id thought India and Sri Lanka probably had the best chance... Both, obviously, are good in ODIs... Its another matter that they didnt click in this Champions Trophy...         
	Indeed, their failure (exiting in the first-round) quickly reduced much of the interest in the tournament.

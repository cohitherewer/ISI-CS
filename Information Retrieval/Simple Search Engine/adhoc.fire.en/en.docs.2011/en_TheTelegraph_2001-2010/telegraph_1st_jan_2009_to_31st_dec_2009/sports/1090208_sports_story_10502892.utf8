The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hole in one takes Rahil to tied 3rd 
                                                     Hole in one takes Rahil to tied 3rd 
                              
	Bangkok: The ace on the third hole was the highlight of Rahil Gangjees penultimate round card of three-under 68 which catapulted the Calcutta pro to tied third place. He is perfectly poised for a late title charge at the Asian Tour International on Sunday.         
	Gangjee had a dream start as he fired the seasons first hole-in-one on the third hole from a distance of 169 yards which catapulted him briefly to a share of the lead before he dropped down following the bogey on the eighth.         
	However, the Indian held his nerves and birdied the ninth to make the turn at 33 but another bogey on the 16th meant that Gangjee ended the day with a three-round aggregate of 11-under 202.         
	It was a horrible shot but it still went into the hole. I didnt really see it going into the hole because I was blocked and I could only see it land. As I was walking towards the hole, I still couldnt see the ball and to my surprise it was in the hole, said Gangjee.         
	In contrast, Gaganjeet Bhullar had a bad day in office as he carded a two-over 73 to lie tied 21st with a three-round total of six-under 207. Gaurav Ghei carded a level-par 71 to be at tied 30 with an aggregate of four-under 209, four strokes ahead of Digvijay Singh (74).         
	At the top, Japans Tesuji Hiratsuka blasted four-under 67 for a one shot lead over Australias Unho Park. (PTI)

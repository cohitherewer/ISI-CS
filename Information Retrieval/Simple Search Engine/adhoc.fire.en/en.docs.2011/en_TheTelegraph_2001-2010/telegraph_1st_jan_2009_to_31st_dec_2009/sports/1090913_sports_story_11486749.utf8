	Calcutta/Monza: Lewis Hamilton, in a McLaren, will start the Italian Grand Prix from pole after leading qualifying Saturday in Monza, while Giancarlo Fisichella will make his Ferrari debut from 14th on the grid.         
	Adrian Sutil nearly fetched Force Indias second successive pole position before Hamilton gatecrashed into his party in the adrenalin-pumped qualifying sessions.         
	Sutil, who had topped the timesheet in two of the three practice sessions, made a slight error in his final flyer through the first Lesmo to settle for the second place on Sundays starting grid.         
	Sutils new Italian teammate Vitantonio Liuzzi dazzled in his Force India F1 debut and will start seventh on the grid.         
	For a moment, it seemed Force India would be celebrating their second pole when Sutil lapped the circuit in 1 minute 24.261 seconds before Hamilton came from behind to run away with the pole.         
	It was a great duel between Sutils VJM02 and Hamiltons Kinetic Energy Recovery System-powered McLaren car and the duo, best of friends, will occupy the front row Sunday.         
	Fisichella had recorded Force Indias maiden pole and podium finish in Belgium.         
	Sutil and Liuzzi made it to the second qualifying session as seventh and eighth fastest cars and then came fourth and fifth, respectively, in Q2 to storm into Q3.         
	This is the first time that both the cars of the Vijay Mallya-owned outfit made it to Q3.         
	Sutil said he was gunning for the pole position since the car was up to the task.         
	After the results Friday and this morning, we wanted to fight for the pole position. We knew the car was up to it and thats what we showed in qualifying today, Sutil said in a release.         
	We have a great package, this circuit suits us very well as we have an incredible top speed and also a good downforce package so the efficiency of the car is really good.         
	Sutil and Hamilton were seen congratulating each other and the German driver said he was looking forward to start from the front row with his best friend.         
	Im starting on the front row with Lewis for the first time since F3 and Im really happy he is next to me, hes a good friend but we will fight hard for it. I have a lot of respect for him, he said.         
	Sutil conceded not having KERS would make the task difficult for him but sounded confident.         
	Its going to be very difficult start with the KERS cars around me but the race is long, Ill do what I have to defend my position and have a good strategy. If the race pace is okay we can gain positions and even if they get past me I have a good, fast car on the straights so its going to be tight, he said.         
	Hamilton, the defending champion earned his 15th career pole after setting a leading lap time of 1 minute, 24.066 seconds.         
	Kimi Raikkonen, coming off a victory at Belgium, goes third for Ferrari at their home circuit and the seasons fastest race, where cars average nearly 250 kmph (155 mph).         
	Overall leader Jenson Button starts sixth, one spot behind closest title rival and Brawn GP teammate Rubens Barrichello, while the Red Bull pair of Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber start ninth and 10th,respectively for Sundays 53-lap race.         
	Hamilton took his second pole position in three races right at the finish with a flying lap that was just under two-tenths faster than Sutils. The driver starting first on the grid here has won seven of the last 10 races.         
	I dont think we anticipated being as quick as we are this weekend, said Hamilton, who came second here in 2007 and who will now enjoy his KERS power boost at the start. It was a very close qualifying session... but I was able to put the lap together.         
	Raikkonen had his sights set on Hamilton.         
	Force India we can jump but McLaren, probably not, the Finnish driver said.         
	Ferrari hired Fisichella after Spa to replace Luca Badoer, who classified last in the two races since taking over for the injured Felipe Massa.         
	I think he did quite well, Sutil said of his former teammate. Fourteenth position is not so bad.Fisichella will be the first Italian to race a Ferrari at Monza since Ivan Capelli in 1992 to give the home fans something to cheer about with no championship fight this year.         
	Both championship leaders endured disappointing performances, although Red Bulls title hopes are likely to take the biggest hit after trailing both Brawn GPs.         
	Button leads with 72 points, Barrichello has 56, Vettel  who won in the rain here last year  53 and Webber 51.5. Brawn GP lead Red Bull by 23.5 points in the constructors series.         
	Button was coming off his first non-points finish of the season at Spa, part of a dip in form that had allowed Barrichello to more than halve his teammates lead.         
	They will be very competitive, Hamilton said of the Brawns. It should be probably one of the most exciting races weve had here for quite a while.         
	BMW Sauber pair Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld start 13th and 15th, respectively, after both drivers pulled off the track with mechanical failures.         
	Nico Rosberg of Williams, who has finished in the points for eight straight races, failed to get out of the initial qualifying session for the first time this season. Liuzzi was no less excited after his sterling show in debut.         
	Two weeks ago I didnt expect to be on the grid so this is a fantastic result  better than we expected, said the Italian. The team made a great effort and gave me a lot of support to reach this target. They never gave up and we had a great Friday and Saturday. The race will be difficult physically and mentally but I like the fight.         
	The team has fighters and we will give the maximum in Sundays race. Im definitely looking forward to racing in front of my home crowd, he said.

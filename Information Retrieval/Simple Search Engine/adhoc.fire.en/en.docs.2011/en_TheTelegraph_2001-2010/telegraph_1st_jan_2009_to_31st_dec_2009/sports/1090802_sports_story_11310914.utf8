	Budapest: Michael Schumacher visited injured Formula One driver Felipe Massa on Saturday at the Hungarian hospital where the 28-year-old Brazilian is recovering from his high-speed crash.         
	Schumacher, who is coming out of retirement to replace Massa at Ferrari, left the AEK hospital with former Ferrari boss Jean Todt, but did not talk to reporters. He later posted a message about the visit on his personal website.         
	Good that I finally made it to see Felipe, I feel better now, Schumacher wrote. I am surprised at his extreme positive condition, as the accident was only one week ago. We sat together for around three hours and were chatting with each other. I really feel (relieved) now.         
	The seven-time world champion, who retired in 2006, used a 2007 version of the Ferrari F1 car to test drive on an Italian track on Friday.         
	I have to say that today (Saturday) I feel muscles I was not even aware anymore they exist, Schumacher said. But then it was clear that you cannot test for a day after such a long time without feeling anything, and I am curious to see what will happen in the coming days.         
	Massas family doctor Dino Altman said Saturday that the Brazilian was doing well and was anxious to go home.         
	According to Altman, Massa will fly home to Sao Paulo in a private jet on Monday to continue his recovery.         
	Massa said Thursday that he was thinking about racing again, but Altman said he did not know how soon the runner-up behind Lewis Hamilton in the 2008 Formula One championship could return to the track.         
	Theres no hurry to bring him back to drive, Altman said. The most important (thing) is to have him fully recovered, in a safe situation.         
	Massa underwent surgery on multiple skull fractures after he was hit on the helmet by a loose part from another car and crashed into a protective tire barrier during qualifying at the Hungarian Grand Prix last Saturday.

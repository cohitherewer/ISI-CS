	Dharamshala: Rohan Gavaskar returned to the official fold in style with a classy 93 to guide Tata SC to an emphatic 71-run victory over All India Public Sector Sports Promotion Board (AIPSSPB) in the rain-truncated first group C match of the Sahara BCCI Corporate Trophy here Tuesday.         
	Gavaskar, playing his first official tournament after snapping ties with the rebel Indian Cricket League, displayed some fluent strokemaking and in skipper Ajit Agarkars company took the Tata SC to a formidable 241 for eight after the matched was reduced to a 36 overs-a-side affair due to rain.         
	In reply, the AIPSSPB batsmen struggled from the beginning and could manage only 170 for nine wickets in their stipulated 36 overs.         
	Agarkar was the pick of the bowlers for Tata, scalping two wickets giving away just six runs off his five overs.         
	Earlier, Gavaskar first blossomed in Nishit Shettys company and then opened up at the fag end of the innings with Agarkar to guide the Tata innings after the initial hiccup.         
	After losing openers Sahil Kukreja (6) and Ishank Jaggi cheaply, Shetty and Gavaskar forged a 70-run fourth wicket stand before Shetty was run out for run-a-ball 33.         
	The Bengal lefthander, however, kept going strong and hit Malhotra for two boundaries in the 20th over to bring up his half century off 65 deliveries and shared a brief stand with Tushar Gharat (11) and Wilkin Mota (16) in the middle before Agarkar joined him.         
	Meanwhile, the match between BSNL and fancied Air India Red in Bangalore was abandoned here tonight with the teams sharing two points each.         
	Brief scores         
	Tata SC 241/8 in 36 ovs (R. Gavaskar 93, A. Agarkar 43). AIPSSPB 170/9 in 36 ovs (P. Thakur 50; Agarkar 6/2). Tata SC won by 71 runs.         
	MRF 191/8 in 48.3 ovs (G. Rao 53; A. Salvi 3/37, R. Verma 2/44, A. Nayar 2/24). BPCL 120/6 in 28.3 ovs. MRF won by 12 runs (via VJD method).

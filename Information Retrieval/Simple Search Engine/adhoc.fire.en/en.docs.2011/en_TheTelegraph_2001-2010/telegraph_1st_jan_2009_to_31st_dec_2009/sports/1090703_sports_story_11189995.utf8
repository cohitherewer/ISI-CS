The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | New format fuels debate
                                                     New format fuels debate
            A STAFF REPORTER            Shabbir Ali                           
	Calcutta: The Calcutta League is going back to the basics. Its a throwback to the days when Calcutta football used to see a larger league with 20 teams slugging it out on the mud spattered Calcutta grounds.         
	The 2009-10 League will see 17 teams playing each other once, unlike previous years two-leg affair involving eight teams.         
	So, will the league be interesting this time around or has the IFA bungled in doing away with quality for quantity. While the proponents say the expanded league will bring interest back among the spectators and help smaller clubs survive, the opponents say the quality of football will be affected.         
	Where are we going to get the players from. Anyway quality players from Calcutta are hard to come by? they argue.         
	Satyajit Chatterjee, the Mohun Bagan assistant coach is among those who have welcomed the decision. Talking to The Telegraph on Thursday, Chatterjee said that this is the best thing to have happened to Calcutta football.         
	Ten or eight-team leagues are a farce. If you leave aside Bagan, East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting, the rest just fight for nothing. This time there will be more teams and more excitement, he said.         
	Chatterjee in fact was one of the first to ask for an expanded league.         
	During one of the coaches committee meetings some years back I floated this idea. But there were no takers. This 17-team league will provide the base for building teams for the future.         
	Dipendu Biswas, who will be donning Mohammedan Sporting colours this season, however doubts Calcutta football will be flooded with talent. I dont think it will happen. I fear we will see some big margin victories after a long time.         
	Dipendu who played for a relatively smaller club  George Telegraph  last season, said that most of the clubs do not want to win against bigger teams.         
	They just play for a point. And the negative mindset has to change if we want to see a competitive league, Dipendu said.         
	His coach Shabbir Ali, however treaded the middle path. Shabbir acknowledged that the new format will see more action but he was not sure about quality.         
	More matches and more players sound fine. But quality? I am not sure.         
	The League gets under way in October and will be played in the midweek with the I-League being played at the weekend. Whether fans get to see some quality or will it be only about quantity remains to be seen.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | This could be our year: Bhaichung
                                                     This could be our year: Bhaichung
            A STAFF REPORTER            Bhaichung                           
	Calcutta: Theres an air of expectancy in Mohun Bagan these days. From players to fans, everyone is talking about bringing back the I-League title. Its already here, is the mood you feel at the Bagan tent.         
	But the man who will hold aloft the trophy if the fans wish is fulfilled remains unperturbed by all the hoopla. Yeah, we have a good chance to win the title, but as the proverb goes theres many a slip between the cup and the lip, Bhaichung Bhutia told The Telegraph on Thursday.         
	Bhaichung says the secret behind Bagans recent string of wins  nine wins on the trot which placed Bagan at the top of the heap with 30 points from 14 matches  has been the teamwork.         
	During the last two years I saw the team was over dependent on me and (Jose Ramirez) Barreto. And even when we were scoring goals the defence was letting us down. But this time it has been different. All the players contributed and the result is there for all to see. Two players can win you a knock-out tournament but not a marathon league. This year we have the depth and character.                 
	But dont the seniors play a big role? Bhaichung agrees and says that he and Barreto are actually playing the big brother role in the team. But this is expected from us. Isnt it? And thats true. Bhaichung and Barretos influence can be gauged from the fact that Ishfaq Ahmed, who was down with a stomach bug on the morning of Bagans Fed Cup semi-final against East Bengal late last year, took the field just because the duo asked him to.         
	Bhaichung told me to play that match and I couldnt say no, Ishfaq said. We needed his deliveries and it was a great show of character from the young man, Bhaichung had a word of praise for the Kashmiri.

                                                   EB, Bhaichung in tete-a-tete
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal are in the final stages of roping in ace striker Bhaichung Bhutia for the upcoming season, according to club sources.         
	It was learnt that top club officials along with coach Subhas Bhowmick had an hour-long meeting with the India captain at a city hotel where the contract was almost settled.         
	The deal is almost final. Today (Monday) afternoon we had a meeting with Bhaichung and he has agreed for a certain amount. The coach was with us and that made things easier, a top East Bengal official said on condition of anonymity.         
	Some club officials, however, rubbished the news. We had no such meeting with Bhaichung. This is totally baseless. Its a rumour only, an official said.         
	Meanwhile, the club are likely to release Rennedy Singh and Saumik Dey to make room for players that are better suited to their scheme of things.         
	Bhowmick said: Look, I have told the management to release those players who are unwilling to play for us. Now its up to them to decide.

                                                     Binny: A big opportunity 
    - 1983 cup winner is Bengal coach           A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Calcutta: The Bengal cricket team will have a new coach in Roger Binny for the forthcoming 2009-10 season.         
	Announcing this at the news conference after a working committee meeting on Saturday, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Jagmohan Dalmiya said that Binny will assume charge in August.         
	A member of Kapil Devs World Cup-winning team and a coach with impressive credentials  he was an Asian Cricket Council (ACC) high performance manager and has worked extensively in Bhutan, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates  Binny will be on the job from the pre-season itself.         
	We had a discussion a week back and on Friday he was in town to complete the formalities, Dalmiya said.         
	Binny, whose last assignment with a senior side  the Karnataka Ranji Trophy team  was in 1999-00 succeeds Utpal Chatterjee. Under Chatterjee Bengal lost in the Ranji Trophy quarter finals and were runners-up in the Vijay Hazare Trophy.         
	Dalmiya said that CAB was very keen to continue Mohinder Amarnath as consultant but his television commitments acted as a hindrance.         
	We had no problem whatsoever with Jimmy. His ideas were very helpful to the players.         
	Binny, for the record, will be Bengals third coach in as many seasons. Bharath Arun was the coach when Bengal were relegated in 2007-08, followed by Chatterjee.         
	Speaking from Bangalore, Binny, who was a nominated Member of the Legislative Committee in the Karnataka Assembly four years back, said it would be a challenge to coach a team like Bengal.         
	I wanted to return to mainstream coaching and when this offer came I just grabbed it, Binny said. Its a very big opportunity for me.         
	Binny said the Bengal players were not unknown to him. Deep (Dasgupta) and Laxmi (Ratan Shukla) were there with me at the NCA camp some years back. I know them well, he said.         
	On the topic of the return of Indian Cricket League (ICL) players to the Bengal team, Binny said he would take a call only after the pre-season.         
	Frankly speaking I am not averse to their induction. Bengal have some class players who were in ICL. The team will need them. I also dont believe that the ICL has hampered their four-day match mentality. Its just a matter of time, he said.         
	It might be recalled that Bengal had been one of the worst sufferers when the rebel league was formed. Players like Abhishek Jhunjhunwala, Deep, Rohan Gavaskar, Eklakh Ahmed and Subhomoy Das were some of the names that switched over. Now, with decks cleared for them to return, it remains to be seen who gets the chance. Binny said the pre-season camp and the tournaments like Moin-ud-Dowla and Buchi Babu will give a fair bit of idea how the team will look in the coming season.         
	On the captaincy issue, however, Binny sought to play straight. Let me take charge first. Then we will decide.         
	Binny said he had a talk with Bengal selection committee chairman Sambaran Banerjee on Saturday evening. I know him for ages and I hope we will have a fruitful partnership. Sambaran, in fact, did not have a very good relationship with Chatterjee.         
	He is coming with a very good reputation. A World Cup winner, who has done wonderfully well during his stint with the ACC. I sincerely hope he becomes a success as a Bengal coach, Sambaran said.         
	Binny said he had already set a target. And whats that? To work together for a common goal which is winning the Ranji Trophy. Bengals performance in the last couple of years hasnt been very impressive.         
	If under Bharath Arun, Bengal had to face the ignominy of being relegated from the Ranji Trophy elite group, there were more off-the-field activities when Chatterjee took over. Even Amarnaths presence could not boost the morale of the Shuklas and Tiwarys.         
	The CAB brass will be hoping that Binnys appointment will be an answer to all those ills thats plaguing Bengal cricket right now.

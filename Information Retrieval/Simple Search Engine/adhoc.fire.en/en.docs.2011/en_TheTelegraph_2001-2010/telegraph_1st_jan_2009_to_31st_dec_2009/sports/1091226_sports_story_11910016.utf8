            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: There is little to choose among the three fillies in a six-horse field lined up for Saturdays Ladies Derby  the 2,400m Poonawalla Calcutta Oaks  Bid For Gold, Harmonica and Sans Pareil. They are going over the Derby trip for the first time but their bloodlines indicate that each of the three may negotiate the trip comfortably.           
	The frontrunning Bid For Gold had a narrow measure Sans Pareil in the 1000 Guineas but in the Oaks, her strategy may be foiled by the speedy filly Castle Queen. Between Sans Pareil and Harmonica, the latter, from trainer Sanjay Kolses yard, appears to have slightly better credentials in view of her Western India performance.

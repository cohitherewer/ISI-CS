                                                   Saina outshines Sania: Prakash
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Saina Nehwals exploits on the badminton court rate higher than fellow Hyderabadi Sania Mirzas achievements in tennis, feels legendary shuttler Prakash Padukone.         
	I would consider Sainas achievements to be any day better than Sanias. Its not just about the ranking, but also how often you beat the top players, Padukone said Tuesday.         
	In tennis, the top players pick and play in tournaments, so the level of the (other) tournaments comes down, said the former All England Champion, at the inauguration of the Tata Open badminton tournament that starts here Wednesday.         
	Saina, 19, has made steady progress over the last two years, entering the top-10 in the world rankings and becoming the first Indian to win a Super Series event when she clinched the Indonesian Open title.         
	Padukone felt Saina had it in her to become world No.1 in two years time. Saina has all the qualities to become the world No.1, provided she continues to work hard and maintain her form.         
	Padukone said that lately, from whatever little he had seen of Sainas game, she seems to have improved her net play and movement on court.         
	She has improved her play at the net and is also moving better. She has always been fit but now seems fitter. But she should not rest on her laurels she should strive to get better in these areas.         
	On the other hand, Sania, who created a storm when she entered the Australian Open through a wild card in 2005, has failed to make an impact at the Grand Slams, with a fourth round appearance at the US Open the same year being her best performance so far.         
	To her credit, Sania is the first Indian to win a WTA Tour title and the first to break into the top-50 in world rankings. All this with injuries repeatedly hampering her game.         
	Padukone, an Arjuna awardee and Padma Shri recipient, said male shuttlers should take a leaf out of world no.7 Sainas book.         
	If she (Saina) can do it, the men can as well. After all, the facilities available to both are the same. They have the talent and commitment but the effort they have put in is not enough to be in the top-10.         
	What I feel is they (the men) need to improve their self-belief when playing against the top players from China, Indonesia and so on. Im happy that five of our men shuttlers are in the top 50 and seven in the top 100, he added.         
	Padukone said that in tournaments like Super Series a player needs to get past three or four highly-rated rivals to win the title.         
	They should be prepared to take on three or four top players in succession from early on, he said.

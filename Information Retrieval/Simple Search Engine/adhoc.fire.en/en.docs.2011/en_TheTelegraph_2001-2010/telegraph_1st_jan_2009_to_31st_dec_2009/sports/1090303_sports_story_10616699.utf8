	Calcutta: Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla said on Monday that his side would be under no sort of pressure ahead of their quarter final clash against Delhi on Wednesday in the National one-dayers for the Vijay Hazare Trophy to be played in Agartala, Tripura.         
	We are under no pressure. We have performed very well in the group matches and hope to continue in the same style, Shukla said ahead of Bengals departure, at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International airport. Shukla and his boys, who were unbeaten in the group league matches of the East Zone, left for Tripura on Monday morning sans Ranadeb Bose. However, the lanky pacer, whose mother was unwell, boarded an evening flight.         
	Asked whether it will be a cakewalk for his boys against Delhi, who will be without Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir and spinner Amit Mishra, Shukla said: Every team have performed well to qualify for this stage. So, all are capable of causing upsets.         
	However, Shukla, rued the absence of former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly.

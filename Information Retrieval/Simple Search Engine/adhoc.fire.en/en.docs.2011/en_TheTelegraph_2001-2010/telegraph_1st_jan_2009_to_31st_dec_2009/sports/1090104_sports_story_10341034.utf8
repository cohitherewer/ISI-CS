The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mankad to focus on doubles
                                                   Mankad to focus on doubles
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Harsh Mankad doesnt like offering lame excuses, figuratively and literally. The Indian Davis Cupper is trying to turn an undiagnosed problem in his knees into a stepping stone to success.         
	The 29-year old Mankad, who made a strong comeback last year after being out of action for nearly the whole of 2007, says doubles would be his focus in the near future.         
	I have been in the top-300 and came close to breaking into the 200 in singles. That is no longer a priority for me. I am ranked 185 in the doubles now and my aim is to play in Grand Slams, for which I need to be in the top-50 or top-75, Mankad told The Telegraph from Chennai on Saturday where he will play in the Chennai Open.         
	I have a knee condition, its not an injury. All the tests advised by the doctors have showed nothing, so it is a bit vague, Mankad said.         
	I continue to have soreness and pain after a match and the recovery takes long.

                                                       McCullum on Sourav                           
	The following are excerpts from what Brendon McCullum said (in Cape Town) on predecessor Sourav Ganguly:         
	Weve got strong leaders... Ideas come to the captain... Im incredibly lucky to have three strong leaders  Sourav, (Brad) Hodge and (Chris) Gayle...         
	Sourav and I get along very well and Im incredibly lucky to have him in my side...         
	The fact that Sourav has had such a strong relationship with the (Indian) guys, in the past, is a positive thing... I dont see it as a problem (for his captaincy)...

                                                   Dasgupta to decide today
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former Bengal captain Deep Dasgupta, it seems, is still in a dilemma over the decision to cut off ties with the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL). The BCCI had earlier set the May 15 deadline for the players affiliated with the ICL to sever their ties with the rebel league.         
	I havent decided as yet. Let me see I will take a call on Friday, Deep said. The ex-India player added that he was also a bit confused regarding the related procedures.         
	It was, however, learnt that Deep was almost certain to return to the BCCI fold.         
	Meanwhile, Rohan Gavaskar, another ex-Bengal player, submitted his application with the ICL on Thursday seeking a clearance certificate.

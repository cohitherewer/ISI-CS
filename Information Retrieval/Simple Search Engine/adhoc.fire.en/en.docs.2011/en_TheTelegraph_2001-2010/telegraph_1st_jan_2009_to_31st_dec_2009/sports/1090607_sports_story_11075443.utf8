                                                   Ashraful: Yuvi is arguably the most destructive Twenty20 batsman
  - Bangladesh captain on the five players who could impact big       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                          
	Nottingham: Mohammed Ashraful, the Bangladesh captain and Test crickets youngest centurion, spoke to The Telegraph at the Park Plaza on Friday. During the one-on-one, he picked five players who could make the biggest splash in the ongoing World T20.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Best way to approach T20 cricket         
	(Smiles) For the batsmen, Id say play pure cricketing shots... Its bound to be effective... For the bowlers, well, they should bowl with a big heart and work out the correct length... I accept that T20 is tough on them...         
	The five players (alphabetically) who could impact big in this World T20:         
	SHAKIB AL HASAN (Bangladesh): Hes already a top all-rounder (No.1 in ODIs) and I have high expectations from him. He has it in him to reach the next level and it will be great if he does so in this tournament. Hes a key player for us.         
	LASITH MALINGA (Sri Lanka): I have nothing but admiration for my Mumbai Indians teammate... I spent a month-and-a-half with him in South Africa and saw that he could bowl exactly what he wanted to... Hes going to make life difficult for the opposition.         
	BRENDON McCULLUM (New Zealand): His game is absolutely suited for T20 cricket... If he gets going, then he can win any match single-handedly... I guess hes himself hungry to do well as this years IPL wasnt a happy experience for him.         
	YUVRAJ SINGH (India): Arguably the most destructive T20 batsman... Im not saying this only because of his six sixes in an over in the first World T20... Besides, hes been getting wickets of late and gives his captain a nice option.         
	SHANE WATSON (Australia): Even if he doesnt bowl, hes capable of being a match-winner with the bat... Very dangerous, especially in crickets shortest form... Hes an asset for his team.         
	Finally, on having shared the Mumbai Indians dressing room with idol Sachin Tendulkar         
	Yes, I grew up hero-worshipping Sachin and one of our former captains, Aminul Islam Bulbul... In the past, Id occasionally interacted with Sachin, but never for too long... Being with him for six weeks or so was, of course, a different experience... Onake bhalo laglo... Hes so honest and down to earth... Sachins top advice has been to enjoy the game... That the performances get better when the enjoyment is there... Im keeping that in mind.

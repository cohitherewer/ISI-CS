	Somdev Dev Varman launched his US Open campaign with a straight-set win over local favourite Alex Bogomolov Jr in the first round of mens singles qualifying singles at Flushing Meadows on Tuesday.         
	Somdev thrashed the 16th-seeded Bogomolov 6-3, 6-3 to advance to the second round of qualifiers at the years final Grand Slam in New York.         
	However, Prakash Amritraj was knocked out of the qualifiers. Prakash had a tough day in office as he fought his heart out against Alejandro Falla of Colombia, the 31st seed, only to lose 6-7(5), 6-4, 3-6.         
	Somdev was quick in grabbing his chances as he converted all the breakpoints that came his way. He broke the Russian born American twice in each set to script a convincing win in one hour and 15 minutes.         
	I played a solid match right from the start. I am feeling good going into the US Open Qualifiers as I have prepared well and I hope I will be able to qualify for the main draw, he said after the match.         
	The Indian is scheduled to play his next match on Thursday with Igor Sijsling of the Netherlands. If he manages to beat Sijsling, ranked 305th in the world, he will then take on the winner of the match between Jerzy Janowic of Poland and 26th seed Alexandre of France.

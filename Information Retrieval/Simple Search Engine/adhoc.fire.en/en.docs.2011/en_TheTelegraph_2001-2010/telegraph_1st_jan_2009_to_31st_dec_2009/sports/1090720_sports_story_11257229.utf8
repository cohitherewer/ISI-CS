	Calcutta: Kemar Roach of the West Indies, who rattled Bangladesh on Saturday, in the second Test in St Georges, Grenada claiming six wickets for 48, said that his performance was nothing short of magical, especially because it was only his second Test appearance.         
	It is a magical moment, taking six wickets in my second Test match is a dream come true, Roach said at the end of the second days play at the National Stadium.         
	Asked about his motivation for bowling with such impressive and sometimes frightening pace, Roach said he was passionate about West Indies cricket and has been longing for an opportunity to showcase his skills on a larger stage.         
	I want to do well in front the crowd and on television I want to show my talent so I was fired up, said the 21-year-old Barbadian.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Thrilling win for AC Milan
                                                     Thrilling win for AC Milan
    - Victories for Chelsea, Juventus; Raul equals Gerd Muellers record                 AC Milans Alexandre Pato (centre) celebrates his second goal with teammates Andrea Pirlo (right) and Marco Borriello during their Champions League match against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on Wednesday                           
	London: The Champions Leagues two most successful teams resembled a pair of punch-drunk prize-fighters as AC Milan spoiled a big night for Raul by pulling off a surprise 3-2 victory at the Bernabeu on Wednesday. Raul scored off a howler from the opponents to equal Gerd Muellers European goalscoring record.         
	Rauls goal showed how sharp he is, Rauls Brazilian teammate Kaka said. He is always incredible and is a player who has broken all the records.         
	While nine-times winners Real and seven-times champions Milan were trading novice mistakes, the other tournament heavyweights were looking coolly efficient.         
	Chelsea extended their perfect record in group D by swatting aside Atletico Madrid 4-0, Salomon Kalou putting a terrible early miss behind him to score the first two, and Juventus revived their Group A hopes with a 1-0 win over Maccabi Haifa.         
	Drogba is still Drogba, Kalou said after the match.         
	Its not an insult to be behind him and (Nicholas) Anelka because they are two of the best strikers in the world right now. But Im pleased to get on the pitch and take my opportunity and do my best.         
	We have proved that even without our main striker we have the character to win without him. But he will be back next time and that is very important for Chelsea even though its hard to accept if you are not playing.         
	Manchester United made light of a plastic pitch at the Luzhniki Stadium, the scene of their 2008 final triumph, to make it maximum points from three Group B matches with a 1-0 win over CSKA Moscow, Antonio Valencia swooping late for the only goal.         
	Tuesdays matches had featured a string of last-gasp goals and shock results and there was more of the same in group C in Madrid, where an AC Milan side struggling in eighth place in Serie A handed Real an embarrassing defeat.         
	Real, missing the most expensive of those recruits in Cristiano Ronaldo, looked set for their third win when Raul pounced on Didas mistake to make it 1-0 and equal Muellers record of 66 goals in the main European club competitions.         
	The game turned when Andrea Pirlo embarrassed Iker Casillas at his near post in the 62nd minute, and the Real keeper, normally among the most reliable of performers, gifted Brazilian striker Alexandre Pato Milans second four minutes later.         
	Royston Drenthe equalised for Real but with two minutes remaining Pato arrived at the back post to volley the winner.         
	Milan and Real have six points apiece in group C, with Olympique Marseille and Zurich both on three after the French side won their game 1-0 in Switzerland thanks to a second-half goal from Argentina defender Gabriel Heinze.         
	I didnt see a great match, said Marseille coach Didier Deschamps.         
	We started very passively until the last few minutes of the first half, there was a lot of physical play and impact and Zurich didnt have any chances. We can do better.         
	His Zurich counterpart Bernard Challandes said his team were too inexperienced.         
	Maybe were too young for the Champions League, he said. We were too naive at Heinzes goal.         
	Manchester United are sitting pretty in group B with maximum points, followed by VfL Wolfsburg on four after they shared a goalless home draw with Besiktas. CSKA Moscow have three points and Besiktas one.         
	Porto striker Hulk gave a suitably heroic performance in group D, scoring twice to haul his side back from a goal down and secure a 2-1 home win over APOEL Nicosia. While Chelsea lead on nine, Porto are second on six and APOEL and Atletico trail on a point apiece.         
	Juventus got their first win in group A thanks to Giorgio Chiellinis goal against Maccabi Haifa.         
	That group is tight after Girondins Bordeaux came from behind to win 2-1 at home to Bayern Munich, who were reduced to nine men after young striker Thomas Mueller  a man who surely dreams of matching the feats of his namesake Gerd  and Daniel Van Buyten were sent off.         
	With three games played, Bordeaux lead with seven points, followed by Juventus on five and Bayern on four. Maccabi have still to score a point. We made sure it remained tense until the end, Bordeaux coach Laurent Blanc said.         
	Bayern put us under pressure at first. They were a bit lucky to score but that actually helped us get into the match.         
	We reacted well by scoring two goals but should have scored a few more, he added.         
	Missing two penalties is not acceptable. Thats something well have to work on in training. Set pieces are important. (REUTERS)

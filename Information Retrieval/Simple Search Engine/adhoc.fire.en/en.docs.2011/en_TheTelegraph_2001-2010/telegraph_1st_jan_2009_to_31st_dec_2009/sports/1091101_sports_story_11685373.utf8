The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Capital gain for Team India 
                                                     Capital gain for Team India 
    - Yuvraj, Dhoni ensure Six-wicket victory to give hosts 2-1 lead           JAYDEEP BASU                        Man of the Match Yuvraj Singh and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni at the Kotla on Saturday.                                  
	New Delhi: A magnificent 148-run fourth wicket stand between Man of the Match Yuvraj Singh (78 off 96 balls) and skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (71 not out off 95 balls) made all the difference as India coasted to a six-wicket win over Australia in the third one-day International on Saturday.         
	For the sell-out crowd at the Kotla, the real enjoyment came late in the evening in the capitals first-ever day and night match when Yuvraj and Dhoni brought India back from a seemingly hopeless position. The victory gave them a 2-1 lead in the seven-match series.         
	Chasing an Australian total of 229 for five on a low and slow track, the Indians looked in deep trouble after they were reduced to 53 for three in 15.2 overs. Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar and Gautam Gambhir were back in the pavilion, and it looked like India were losing their way.         
	Just when a few spectators started leaving the stadium, Yuvraj and Dhoni got down to the job of rebuilding the innings. Both avoided risks and cut down on their usual aggressive style. They went about their task much like Mike Hussey and Ricky Ponting during the Australian innings. No doubt the duo were successful in their endeavour.         
	Once the target became less than 100 runs, Yuvraj changed tactics to launch an onslaught from the 34th over. He hit a sensational six off Moises Henriques and then slammed Adam Voges for a six and a four in the next over.         
	Thereafter, there was no stopping India, especially Yuvraj, who was finally trapped leg before by Henriques when India were 29 runs away from the target. In all, Yuvrajs knock contained eight boundaries and two sixes.         
	Dhoni, on the other hand, was happy to play second fiddle and allowed his left-handed partner to dominate. The Indian captain, however, did the most crucial job of staying around till the target was reached with 10 balls to spare. He hit six boundaries.         
	India made a good start, as Sachin smacked two boundaries in Mitchell Johnsons first over, which produced 12 runs. But the scoring rate dipped soon as Sehwag (11) didnt look to be in his elements. He was strangely subdued and could not find the gaps through the fielders.         
	The Delhi opener was struck on his feet by a Peter Siddle delivery in the eighth over and had to be treated on the field. He didnt stay long as he found his middle stump uprooted by Johnson in the next over.         
	To make matters worse, Johnson delivered yet another blow, this time as a fielder. Standing at mid off, the Aussie all-rounder made a direct throw in the 14th over that had Sachin run out for 32.         
	Sachin was followed by Gambhir, who seemed to have a bad day on the field. While fielding at forward short leg, he was hit on the neck by a Ponting pull and had to return to the dressing room to receive treatment. With the bat, he could manage only six before being bowled by Nathan Hauritz.         
	In the Australian innings, Hussey came up with a gritty knock of unbeaten 81. If Hussey played a crucial role in the death overs to step up the run rate, Ponting was the man who batted with patience and skill to build the innings.         
	Coming in as an opener for the second time in his one-day career, the Aussie captain led from the front in the true sense as he didnt try anything fancy during his innings of 59 in 92 deliveries with the help of five boundaries.         
	A picture of determination, Ponting along with Shane Watson (41) put on 72 runs for the first wicket in 16.2 overs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Coach: Should go for the kill
                                                   Coach: Should go for the kill
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Raghu Nandy was a distraught man on Saturday. His skipper, and dependable defender, Habibur Rehman Mondal is unlikely to play the Santosh Trophy final against Goa here on Sunday and the Bengal coachs calculations have gone haywire.         
	He is a vital player for us. He was taking a lot of load and was showing his leadership qualities. A big blow to us, he said. Nandy though was confident that Rajib Ahmed, the man who replaces Habibur, will live up to the challenge. You should take these chances to prove your mettle, he said.         
	A superstitious man, Nandy has camped his team at the same hotel where Bengal stayed when they won in 1999, the George Telegraph coach said this was Bengals best chance to bring the trophy back.         
	Now or never. We have a weakened opposition and are confident of getting crowd support. The Chennai crowd wont back a team which threw Tamil Nadu out of the tournament. We should go for the kill, he said.         
	Nandy is a wary of one Climax Lawrence in the Goan ranks. He is the danger man. We have to be careful whenever Goa go into attack. He has this habit of sneaking in unmarked and scoring goals. Have to be cautious.         
	Last matchs hero Gauranga Biswas said he would like to get his name on the scoresheet Sunday. Two in semi-finals, at least one in the final. I wont complain.         
	Snehasish Chakraborty, who will wear the captains armband Sunday, said his team would give their best. Goa coach Mariano Dias said too much is being written about Bengal, Goa and that drubbing in Chennai ten years back.         
	Look in football such things happen. Its just hype built up by the Calcutta press Nothing more. You have to understand that Bengal dont have the same respect they used to command some years back. Now (teams like) Services, Tamil Nadu are also coming up fast. Goa and Punjab were always there, he said.         
	Candid enough to admit that Goa were lucky to survive the semi-final against Tamil Nadu, Dias said maybe the luck factor will get them the trophy. To win you need a little bit of luck. I hope we have that on Sunday.

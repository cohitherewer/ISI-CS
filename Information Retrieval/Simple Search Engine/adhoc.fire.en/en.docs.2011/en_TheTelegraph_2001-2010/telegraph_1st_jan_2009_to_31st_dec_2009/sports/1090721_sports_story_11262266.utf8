	Sourav for CAB working committee   
	Calcutta: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly will represent Bhukailash Sporting at the next Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) working committee. The club took the decision at a meeting on Monday.   
	The working committee comprises 40 clubs and by rotation it is Bhukailashs turn this year. General secretary Mintu Das, however, will represent the club at the annual general meeting on July 31. The former India captain is unlikely to attend the AGM from any other club in the current circumstances.         
	Meanwhile, the CAB ruling group, led by Jagmohan Dalmiya, on Monday announced an unchanged panel.         
	THE PANEL         
	President: Jagmohan Dalmiya. Vice-presidents: Samar Kar, Sibaji Dutta, Shib Kumar Kalyani, Timir Ghosh. Joint secretaries: Arun Kumar Mitra, Biswarup Dey. Treasurer: Subir Ganguly.         
	Conference         
	 Calcutta: Former cricketers Sourav Ganguly, Bishan Singh Bedi alongwith Angus Fraser, Clive Lloyd and Bob Willis will assess how the game has changed over the years at ICC History Conference in Oxford on Wednesday and Thursday.         
	Other notable personalities who will attend the conference are former ICC president Ehsan Mani, ICCs first chief executive David Richards, ICC president David Morgan, ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat, ICC director and England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Giles Clarke and ECB chief executive David Collier.         
	ICC decision         
	 Calcutta: The ICC on Monday clarified the rules relating to referrals of low catch decisions to the third umpire after a row erupted in the second Ashes Test at Lords, saying that the on-field umpires have the authority to decide which catch to refer to. It is simply a question of whether either on-field umpire is able to make the call himself or needs advice from third umpire. If he is confident of the decision then he will make it himself regardless of how near or far away the incident took place, Crowe said.         
	Punjab coach         
	 Chandigarh: The Punjab Cricket Association on Monday appointed former cricketer and national selector Bhupinder Singh (Sr.) as coach for the state Ranji team for 2009-10. Bhupinder, who took over from Arun Sharma, represented the country in 1994 and also served as Punjab team captain from 1989-1991.         
	Mortaza out         
	 Dhaka: Injured Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza has been ruled out of the ODI series against the West Indies starting later this month, the Bangladesh Cricket Board said on Monday. Mortaza fell awkwardly while bowling on the third day of the first Test earlier this month. An MRI scan confirmed Mortaza had suffered cartilage damage in his right knee.

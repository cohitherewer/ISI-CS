The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pennetta blows Sania   away
                                                   Pennetta blows Sania   away
                            
	New York: Indias Sania Mirza offered no excuses following her 6-0, 6-0 whitewash at the hands of 10th seed Flavia Pennetta at the US Open on Wednesday. The 22-year-old Indian was had no chance against the in-form Pennetta, the first Italian woman to reach the worlds top 10.         
	Meanwhile on Tuesday, the fourth-seeded Indo-Czech duo of Leander Paes and Lukas Dloughy beat the Romanian pair of Victor Hanescu and Gabriel Trifu 7-6(13-11), 7-6(7-4) to enter the second round of the mens doubles. They won the gruelling match in an hour and 47 minutes. They next play the winner of Nicolas Almagro-Ruben Ramirez Hidalgo of Spain and Teimuraz Gabashvili-Dmitry Tursunov of Russia.         
	If she plays like that, shes going to win the Open, Mirza told reporters following the 50-minute, second-round blowout under sunny skies at Louis Armstrong Stadium.         
	I wasnt thinking, Im playing such horrible tennis. She had an answer for everything. Thats something you just have to deal with and move on. Tomorrows a new day.         
	While Pennetta has been riding a hot streak, winning the title in Los Angeles last month, World No. 74 Sania has been playing most of her tennis on the International Tennis Federation circuit, a level below the main tour.         
	The first set was over in 22 minutes and though Sania had a game point in the first and fifth games of the second, she could not get on the scoreboard.         
	Sania said she could not recall ever getting blanked in a tennis match, even as a junior.         
	I could have been more aggressive but then again she didnt give me a chance to do anything, she said. She was there from the word go. She was so aggressive.         
	The 27-year-old Pennetta, who lost only four games in her first-round match against Romanias Edina Gallovits, had only 10 unforced errors against Sania.         
	Sania said Pennetta always had a great backhand but her improved forehand has made her particularly dangerous.         
	Suddenly youre thinking, What do I do now? Shes hitting from both the flanks and shes hitting really well, said Hyderabadi. She was all over the place.         
	I told her in the locker room, If you play like this youre going to be number one in the world.                   (AGENCIES)

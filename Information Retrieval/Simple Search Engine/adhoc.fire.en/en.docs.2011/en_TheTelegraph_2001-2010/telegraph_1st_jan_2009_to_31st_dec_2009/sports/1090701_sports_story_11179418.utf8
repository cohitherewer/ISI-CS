                                                   Edge of the seat Wimbledon epics
            Charlie Caroe                      
	The nature of finals ensures they will feature heavily in any list of tense matches at Wimbledon or elsewhere.         
	Here are five of the most exciting, what do you think?               
	(2008 mens final)         
	The greatest match ever? Most people believe so as Rafael Nadal dethroned King Roger in the darkness of Centre Court. After four hours and 48 minutes, spread across seven rain-interrupted hours, the left-hander overcame the right-hander, the pretender became the champion as power and determination usurped grace and elegance. The baton passed between two of the games greatest as Nadal became the first man since Bjorn Borg to follow victory on the Parisian clay with success on the grass of SW19, and deny Federer a sixth straight title.         
	2. Bjorn Borg bt John McEnroe 1-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-7, 8-6         
	(1980 mens final)         
	The Tiebreak. The greatest match until last years final was also a left versus right, fire versus ice affair. Borg recovered from wasting five match points in the fourth set tiebreak, which he lost 18-16, to lift his fifth successive Challenge Cup. A year later the result was reversed and Borg would never return to Wimbledon against a contestant.         
	3. Margaret Court bt Billie Jean King 14-12, 11-9         
	(1970 ladies final)         
	The longest ever first set in a Wimbledon final, the two greats played through the pain barrier (Court was pumped with novocaine for her ankle, and King had an operation on her knee the week after). After two hours and 27 tense minutes Court had her third title, and 18th Grand Slam win.         
	4. Pancho Gonzalez bt Charlie Pasarell 22-24, 1-6, 16-14, 6-3, 11-9         
	(1969 mens first round)         
	The second year of the Open era witnessed a marathon match at Wimbledon that led to the advent of the tiebreak. Richard Pancho Gonzalez may have been 41 but he managed to outlast Puerto Rican Charlie Pasarell in a match timed at five hours 12 minutes, spread over 2 days and encompassing 112 games. Gonzalez found himself 0-40 down twice in the final set but still managed to survive the challenge of a player 16 years his junior.         
	5. Goran Ivanisevic bt Pat Rafter 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 2-6, 9-7         
	(2001 mens final)         
	The football crowd atmosphere on the third Monday, as the All England Club made all Centre Court tickets available on general sale, only increased the drama. The Croatian wildcard was seeking to make it fourth time lucky on finals day and Rafter hoping to improve on his defeat to seven-time champion Pete Sampras 12 months earlier. After Ivanisevic had successfully pleaded with the gods to make his dream come true, Rafter shook his hand at the net and said: Mate, Im happy for you.

            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: As expected, jockey C. Alford did full justice to his favourites, winning six of the eight events in Saturdays race card. His tally included the feature event, the Mayfowl Cup, in which he had to use all aces up his sleeve to guide the Pesi Shroff-trained Arktouros to a short-head victory over a strongly fancied Samarkhand. Alford also helped Vijay Singh saddle a treble.

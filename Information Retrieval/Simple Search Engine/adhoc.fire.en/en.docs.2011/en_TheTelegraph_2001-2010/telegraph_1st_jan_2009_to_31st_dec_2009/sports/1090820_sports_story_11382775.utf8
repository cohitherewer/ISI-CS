The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 7 Delhi players skip practice
                                                   7 Delhi players skip practice
                      
	New Delhi: The Delhi Ranji team started its preparatory camp for the upcoming domestic season without seven players, but faced with a players revolt, the officials insisted that unrest against the state association was not the reason behind their absence.         
	After Virender Sehwags outburst against nepotism and corruption inside the Delhi District and Cricket association (DDCA), seven players including pacer Ishant Sharma and opener Gautam Gambhir skipped camps opening day.         
	However, DDCA vice-president and selection committee chairman Chetan Chauhan insisted that the players had stayed away due to other engagements.         
	All the players are here and as for those who are not, they have informed me about their engagements. Gambhir and (Ashish) Nehra have told me that they would join tomorrow (Thursday), he said.         
	Sehwag is in Kochi for an ad shoot, while a couple of others are playing in England, he added.         
	Apart from Sehwag, Ishant, Gambhir and Nehra, the others missing were Rajat Bhatia, Mithun Manhas and Chaitanya Anand.         
	Sehwag, who has threatened to quit the Delhi team, is likely to meet the DDCA president Arun Jaitley on August 26 or 27 and officials said a resolution would be worked out.         
	Everything will be sorted out when Jaitley meets Sehwag. There is no question of the DDCA letting these players go.         
	They are world-class players. Jaitley is in Shimla right now but he has been briefed about the situation, a DDCA source said.         
	Delhi coach Vijay Dahiya sought to play down the issue.

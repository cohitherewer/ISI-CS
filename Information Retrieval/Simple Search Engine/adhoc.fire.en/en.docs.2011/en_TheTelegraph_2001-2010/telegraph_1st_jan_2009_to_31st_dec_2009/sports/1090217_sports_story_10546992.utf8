                                                   Lalawmpuiya rehab
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan will miss the services of P.C. Lalawmpuiya in the Calcutta derby Sunday after club officials decided to send him to a rehabilitation centre on the southern fringes of the city.         
	We are sending him to an alcohol rehabilitation centre for a 10-day programme, a top Bagan official said Monday evening.         
	He (Lalawmpuiya) is a good footballer But he has this problem of drinking. We should help him come out of this bad habit and we are sure that Lalawmpuiya will emerge as the best striker in the country. We are just helping him out, the official added.         
	However, it was learnt that the striker was unwilling to go to the centre and was not at his residence when Bagan officials went there to take him to the centre.         
	Incidentally, Lalawmpuiya was arrested and later released on a personal bond for drunken driving and riding a bike without a helmet on Saturday night.

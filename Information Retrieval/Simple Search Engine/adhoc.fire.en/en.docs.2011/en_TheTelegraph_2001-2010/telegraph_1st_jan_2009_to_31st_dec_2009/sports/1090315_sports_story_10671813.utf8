The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mickelson leads, Jeev slips to tied eighth
                                                     Mickelson leads, Jeev slips to tied eighth
                  Phil Mickelson of the US tees off at the Doral Golf Resort in Miami on Friday. (Reuters)                     
	Miami: Overnight joint leader Jeev Milkha Singh could not recreate the opening round magic and turned in a one-under 71 to slip to the tied eighth spot after the halfway stage of the US$8.5 million World Golf Championships here.         
	At the top, American Phil Mickelson grabbed a two-stroke lead after a second round 66. Tiger Woods was 10 shots behind.         
	Jeev, who outshone mega stars like Woods with an opening round 65, faltered on a treacherous back nine and was five strokes off the pace after two days with a total of eight-under 136.         
	The Chandigarh-pro shares the eighth spot with, among others, Englands Ryder Cup star Ian Poulter (67).         
	Off to a brilliant birdie-birdie start, Jeev completed a flawless front nine after picking up another stroke on the eighth to make the turn three-under.         
	The back-nine started equally well for the Indian as he reeled off birdies on the 10th and 12th but it all went downhill thereafter as he stumbled to back-to-back bogeys on the 13th and 14th.         
	Had it not been for a 16th-hole birdie, Jeev would have failed to break par as he had a disastrous bogey-double bogey end to his day at the Doral Golf Resort and Spa.         
	Phil Mickelson chipped in for another birdie putting him in the last group at Doral Resort for the first time in three years. The only difference this time will be the company he keeps.         
	Tiger Woods, his nemesis on the Blue Monster, was 10 shots behind. It kind of (stinks), Mickelson said.         
	I hope he comes out tomorrow and plays a great round and makes a move. I would love to get him back from 05. I came close in 05 and got beaten, and I would love the opportunity to play head-to-head.         
	Mickelson was at 13-under 131 and will have to settle on Saturday for the company of Buick Invitational winner Nick Watney, who shot a 67. Rory McIlroy, the 19-year-old from Northern Ireland who is trying to become the youngest U.S.         
	PGA Tour winner in history, finished with an eagle and a birdie on two dangerous holes for a 66 and was two shots behind. He was tied with 48-year-old Kenny Perry, who has three children older than McIlroy.         
	Woods beat Mickelson in an electric final round four years ago at Doral that came down to the last shot. They were paired again in the last group in the third round in 2006, and Woods got the best of him again.         
	This time, however, Woods looks like just another player in the field. He again struggled with his distance control, the frustration growing with every shot too long or too short, leaving him few birdie chances.         
	He made some progress, though  a 70, one shot better than the day before. But he was at 3-under 141 and in a tie for 35th in the 80-man field at this World Golf Championship.         
	When told that Mickelson was disappointed he could not face Woods, the worlds No. 1 player smiled.         
	Me, too, he said. What am I? Ten back? Thats not a very good spot to be in. Hopefully, tomorrow (Saturday) I can shoot a good round and at least give myself somewhat of a chance going into Sunday.         
	Woods returned from knee surgery two weeks ago in match play, but this is his first stroke-play event since he won the U.S. Open last June, and it showed.         
	It was the first time in his 19 starts at a WGC event that he has failed to break 70 in the first two rounds. And he has never been this low on the leaderboard at any time, let alone the weekend.         
	I need to play well and I need to have help, and thats the problem when youre so far back, Woods said. Youre not really in control of your destiny being that far back. He didnt have much control of his shots, either.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England out for 117
                                                   England out for 117
                      
	Bridgetown: Dwayne Bravo put up a stellar performance with the ball as England were bundled out for a meagre 117 in 41.3 overs in the third one-dayer in Barbados. Bravo rattled Englands batsmen picking up four for 19.         
	The game was reduced to 44 overs a side due to rain interruptions. England, struggling at 71 for eight by the 27th over, could have faced further humiliation if Dimitri Mascarenhas hadnt scored an useful 36.         
	West Indies bowled superbly and caught everything that flew their way.         
	But on a wicket spiced up by heavy showers, England collapsed in a frenzy of ill-judged shots. Fidel Edwards, in an aggressive opening spell, claimed both the openers in the space of three deliveries, while Lionel Baker at the other end bowled his nine overs straight off the reel giving away only 21 runs, thus keeping the run-rate in check.         
	He bowled five maiden overs before capping his spell with the wicket of Shah.         
	Captain Andrew Strauss was the first to fall. A bouncer from Edwards got big on him and he was caught by Gayle at slip. Strauss opening partner Ravi Bopara was on his way back in the same over, courtesy of a muffed hook which landed into Ramnaresh Sarwans hands at mid-on.         
	The unhappy Kevin Pietersen, bored of the tour and in no mood to rebuild, was dismissed in a similar fashion as he picked out Kieron Pollard at the deep mid-wicket off Bravo. Owais Shah was the next to go falling to Baker.           (AGENCIES)

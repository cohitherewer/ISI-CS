The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Injured Marsh out, Ricky rested 
                                                   Injured Marsh out, Ricky rested 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Ricky Ponting was rested, while a hamstring injury ruled out opener Shaun Marsh from the 13-man Australian squad announced on Monday for the next two one-dayers of the five-match series against New Zealand.         
	Adam Voges and rookie Callum Ferguson have been brought in to replace Marsh and Ponting for the next two matches in Melbourne on Friday and in Sydney on Sunday.         
	Michael Clarke will take over captaincy in Pontings absence with Hussey as his deputy in the next two matches of the series which Australia trails 0-1 after the defeat in Sundays nail-biting contest in Perth.         
	Shaun Marsh has been ruled out with a hamstring injury and, consistent with Cricket Australias policy on managing player workload, Ricky Ponting has not been named in this squad, national selection panel Chairman Andrew Hilditch said in a statement issued by Cricket Australia.         
	Naturally, as Australian captain, Ricky is keen to play every game and these next two games were no exception. However, it was always planned that Ricky would have a break at this time.         
	Adam Voges and Callum Ferguson are additions to the squad. Both Adam and Callum are having very strong Ford Ranger Cup seasons. While it is a difficult time for the side it is very important that we continue to show faith and support this young side as we rebuild, he added.         
	Hilditch admitted that resting Ponting was a difficult decision considering the current slump in the Australian teams form.         
	While this is a difficult decision for the NSP, given the current performance of the team, in our view it is essential that Ricky has an opportunity to prepare for the forthcoming South Africa tour given his immense workload since the start of the India tour in late September last year.         
	The squad: Michael Clarke (captain), Mike Hussey (vice-captain), Nathen Bracken, Callum Ferguson, Brad Haddin (wk), Ben Hilfenhaus, James Hopes, David Hussey, Mitchell Johnson, Shaun Tait, David Warner, Cameron White, Adam Voges.

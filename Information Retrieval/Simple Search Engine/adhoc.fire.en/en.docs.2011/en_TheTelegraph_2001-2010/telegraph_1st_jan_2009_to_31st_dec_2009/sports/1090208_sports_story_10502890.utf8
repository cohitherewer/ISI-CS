                                                     IPL safe, but meltdown hits Abhinav Bindra
    - Iconic Olympians school project pushed into low gear           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Abhinav Bindra                                 
	Calcutta: Call it a global meltdown or worldwide slowdown, even its shadow though wasnt anywhere near the Taj property which hosted auction No.2 of the Indian Premier League (IPL), on Friday.         
	The eight franchise owners, after all, had no qualms over spending a whopping $ 7.65 million for as few as 17 players, some of whom may still be finding it hard to believe they got that many bucks.         
	While the IPL has been lucky, the meltdown/slowdown has hit the iconic Abhinav Bindra, Indias only individual gold medal-winner in the Olympics.         
	Specifically, his plan to launch a chain of hi-tech schools, with enough quality infrastructure for sports, is now in low gear.         
	The global meltdown has limited the availability of finances Today, thats the reality The other important issue is land at the appropriate place and price, Bindra told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Saturday, he added: Our plan is ambitious and wed like to start with a school near (home town) Chandigarh Ideally, wed like the project to begin by the end of this year and while were awaiting responses from different quarters, were setting our own house in order.         
	The proposed venture is laudable, though its the familys five-star hotel project in Uttarakhand which is getting all the attention.         
	Asked whether hed been surprised at how the IPL auction unfolded in Goa, in whats a slowdown era, the straight-talking Bindra replied: Indeed, I was Well over $ 7 million and that too for a Twenty20 tournament Its disappointing that our companies shell out crores for foreign players I hope a day comes when theyll decide to back an Olympic aspirant from their own country, be it with a few thousands to start with!         
	Many, surely, would raise a toast: Jai ho.         
	Bindra, meanwhile, is excited that hell be flying in an F-16 during the upcoming Aero India show in Bangalore.         
	Look, its a chance to be adventurous The invitation first came from the US ambassador (David Mulford) and, then, the Lockheed Martin people got in touch with me Its a nice gesture on their part and, yes, Im excited, he said.         
	The flight, on Thursday, could be for around 45 minutes. Actually, Bindra would be game even for a longer haul.

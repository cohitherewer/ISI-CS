The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We showed fight: Bhutia
                                                   We showed fight: Bhutia
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The rise of India s football heroes, on Monday night, is the stuff of dreams and Bob Houghton and his brave band of boys deserve every bit of the adulation.         
	Tuesday, the day after, saw the members of the Indian team being sought after by media and fans alike. While a big camera crew followed Bhaichung Bhutia and his boys wherever they went, the fans jostled with each other to catch a glimpse of the Nehru Cup champions.         
	Bhaichung was quick to point out that it was team effort that was behind their success. The concept of Team India has finally succeeded. Previously, at times, when we used to play for India, things looked disjointed. But now under (Bob) Houghton we are playing like a team.         
	On Monday, against Syria, we were a fighting lot, ready to battle for every inch. Thats the spirit we have at the moment. I am sure we will be a much more matured side when we play in the Asian Cup in 2011, said the India captain.         
	Bhaichung said he would like to be there to lead from the front in the 2011 Asian Cup. The team has reached the finals for the first time in 25 years. I have never played in that tournament. I definitely want to play in that tournament, added the ace striker.         
	Houghton, too, made it clear that his focus was on the Asian Cup.         
	According to the Briton, the Nehru Cup victory is the second most important win, after last years AFC Challenge Cup victory. The AFC one was greater because it helped us qualify for the Asian Cup. This continuation of the teams success is important. We made just one change in the starting XI for this match. The next 18 months before the Asian Cup will be most crucial. We need to maintain our preparation at the highest level, the coach said.         
	Houghton, then, has a clear idea of what is more important to Indias bid to become a quality side. So, the second Nehru Cup victory is second to the AFC win. But domestic tournaments feature nowhere on the Britons roadmap. His opposition to the domestic events is well-known and, suspended during the Nehru Cup, Bob, it seems, is ready to reopen the battle.         
	Houghton didnt like it a bit that most of the Indian team members checked out within four hours of the Nehru Cup victory to catch their flights to Calcutta so that they can turn out for their respective clubs in the IFA Shield. And neither did he hide his displeasure.         
	Houghton said it was a crazy decision to rush players back for the IFA Shield only a few hours after the gruelling Nehru Cup final.         
	Houghton and captain Bhaichung Bhutia were the main attractions at the launch of All India Football Federation (AIFF)s tie-up with Coca Cola for the under-16 national championship for the Mir Iqbal Hussain Trophy.         
	The IFA Shield? Its crazy, said Houghton, who has been demanding for a long time that tournaments like the IFA Shield, the Durand Cup and the Santosh Trophy be scrapped.         
	Its crazy to see these players flying out to play in the IFA Shield. Are we serious? Is it a serious decision by people who run professional football? asked the Briton.         
	Houghton once again pointed out that things wouldnt improve unless changes were made at the grassroots level.         
	Clubs should become much more professional. A player goes back to his club and does not get the kind of professional support he gets when with the national team. The I-League clubs dont even have their own grounds, no physios, no trainers of the same level that the AIFF can provide, said the 61-year-old coach.

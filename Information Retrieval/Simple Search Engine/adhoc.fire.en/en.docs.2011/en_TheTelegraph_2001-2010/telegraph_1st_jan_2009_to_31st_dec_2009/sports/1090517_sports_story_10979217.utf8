The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rafa can better Laver: Agassi
                                                   Rafa can better Laver: Agassi
                      
	London: Andre Agassi has tipped Rafael Nadal to surpass his own achievements and win a calendar Grand Slam. Nadal, who begins the defence of his French Open title later this month, is undefeated at Roland Garros since 2005 and, after adding the 2008 Wimbledon and 2009 Australian crowns to his collection, the World No. 1 has proved his versatility on all surfaces.         
	Agassi, who was at Wimbledon on Saturday, believes the Spaniard could become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to complete a rare Grand Slam.         
	When he first won in Paris and he came here and said it was awesome to win the French Open but his dream was to win in Wimbledon, people laughed and I was one of them, the American told reporters a day before playing in an exhibition event to unveil the new roof over Wimbledons Centre Court.         
	I never thought for a second his game could ever translate (on grass) but he calls his shot and he executes it and it wouldnt shock me to see him pull off the unthinkable.         
	The most difficult part of the season would be the transition from clay to grass in that sort of time frame (two weeks).         
	If you ever did well enough in Paris it was a pretty significant challenge to show up here feeling ready physically, emotionally or mentally. So to see what Nadal managed to accomplish last year was part of what made it so special, watching that epic final (win over Roger Federer in five sets) that probably transcends any other match ever played.

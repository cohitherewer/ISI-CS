                                                   Court rules in the sponsors favour
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Calcutta high court, on Friday, issued an order in favour of Sahara India, the official sponsor of the Indian mens hockey team, restraining Hockey India from permitting the national team to play without their logo.         
	Sahara, whose agreement with the defunct Indian Hockey Federation runs till 2011-12, had moved court when Hockey India refused to acknowledge them as the sponsors and went ahead with the tour of Europe without the teams apparel and kit having the Sahara logos.         
	A.K. Mattoo, president Hockey India, said he was unaware of the development. We havent received any papers, and so are in no position to make a comment, he said.

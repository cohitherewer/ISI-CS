                                                     Pak debate over Asif

While England will play the first semi-final on Friday, Pakistan play the second on Saturday. (AFP)                           
	Karachi: Controversial pacer Mohammed Asifs impressive comeback against Australia has left the Pakistan team management in a fix over the playing XI for their semi-final against New Zealand in the Champions Trophy on Saturday.         
	Pakistan captain Younis Khan admitted that Asifs successful comeback to international cricket, after nearly 17 months, has forced the tour selection committee to engage in lengthy discussions to decide upon the playing XI for the semi-final.         
	We might even decide to play with four specialist pace bowlers in Asif, Rana Naved-ul Hasan, Umar Gul and Mohammed Aamer, but it all depends on the pitch condition at the Wanderers, Younus said from Johannesburg.         
	Pakistan had rested left-arm pacer Aamer and opener Imran Nazir in their last group match against Australia, which they lost on the last ball.         
	Younis said Nazir was rested because he still had stitches on the webbing of his hand, which he tore during the game against India.         
	We didnt want to risk him. And if he plays in the semi-final, then definitely it would be Misbah-ul Haq who will have to sit out, he said.         
	Younis, however, did not rule out the possibility of both Nazir and Misbah not playing, if Pakistan decide to field four pacers. It is a dicey situation for us as we dont want to go into the match with any weak links. Reading the pitch correctly would be the key to our performance, he said.         
	Team manager Yawar Saeed said although selecting the team will be difficult, they are happy to be in such a situation.         
	It is good to be in a position where you dont know which player to drop or rest, because all of them are doing well, Yawar said.         
	He said Pakistan had tried their level best against Australia.         
	I think we fought splendidly despite having only 205 runs on the board. No one in the dressing room had discussed before or during the match, the fact that if we lose, it would send India out of the tournament. The players were just told to go out and try to maintain the winning momentum. I think the four best teams in this competition have qualified for the semi-finals, Yawar remarked.         
	Mohammed Yousuf, meanwhile, believes Pakistan are favourites against New Zealand. We have fought and played well in all of our three games so far, Yousuf said. The entire team gave a good performance and our morale is high. I think we are favourites in the semi-final and I hope we win this match.         
	Anything can happen in one-day cricket, but if you consider the performances of both the sides, I think we have an upper hand. No doubt, they played really well in their last two matches against Sri Lanka and England. Their pace bowling is really good, especially with the return of Shane Bond. It will be a good contest.

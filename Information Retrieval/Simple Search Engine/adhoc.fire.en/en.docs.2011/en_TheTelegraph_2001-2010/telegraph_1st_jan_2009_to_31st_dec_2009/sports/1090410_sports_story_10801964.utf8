The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vaughan is ready for return
                                                   Vaughan is ready for return
                      
	London: Former captain Michael Vaughan expects he will have to regain his place in the England team by next month if he is to make the Ashes squad.         
	Vaughan, who was named in Englands 25-man performance squad on Wednesday, said the selectors will have settled on their side to face Australia in July by the time the Test series against the West Indies begins on May 6.         
	They will pick the team for the first Test against the West Indies with one eye on the Ashes, said Vaughan.         
	Having spent the close season training with his county team Yorkshire, Vaughan said he was ready to return to the England team.         
	Now I feel refreshed and ready. Im in the right kind of mind and form to go out and play for England again.           (REUTERS)

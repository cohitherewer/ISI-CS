The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Set Alight is favourite
                                                                                                               Set Alight is favourite 
            PRAVESH GUPTA                            
	Mumbai: Stage is set for the mother of all Derbies - the Indian Derby - billed for Sunday. There are 15 horses, including six fillies, in the line-up for the richest-ever Derby. The winner takes home well in excess of Rs one crore, Rs 1,12,35,000 to be precise, thanks to the UB Group which will be sponsoring almost the entire weekends racing bonanza.          
	Eleven of the 15 Derby hopefuls boast of winning a Derby or at least a shorter classic in the last 10 months. Therefore, on paper, it is going to be some Derby, but the purists argue that Set Alight is a class apart. Her report card reads: Unbeaten till date in her 10 career starts. More importantly, the filly already has the Bangalore (summer) Derby and the Indian 1,000 Guineas under her belt. Therefore, she is not short of classic experience.          
	Many champions in the past have, however, failed the Indian Derby test. Even a great galloper like Southern Empire was no match for his stablemate, Diabolical, two seasons ago. Much like Southern Empire, Set Alight is going to be a hot favourite, but short odds dont guarantee her the winners crown.           
	The pace in the Indian Derby is always unduly fast, the long Mahalaxmi straight and the luck of clear galloping room in a big Derby field are the other factors which make or break champions. Trainer Pesi Shroffs camp, however, feels, Set Alight is yet to do anything wrong. The camp also rates Set Alight phenomenal filly. Shroff was not available for comment.          
	Set Alight is, however, yet to cross swords against Autonomy and Abs Fabs in Classics. The two horses are the winners of the Indian 2,000 Guineas and the Calcutta Derby winners, respectively. It is learnt that the small-made filly was not pushed to contest all classics. The reason being the crammed Mumbai season, because of the late start. However, both Autonomy and Abs Fabs have improved tremendously in the last four months.           
	Equally improved are the two other fillies in the field, Riyasat and Nora, who had finished one and two in the Ladies Derby the 2,400m Indian Oaks.           
	Mumbaikars will be screaming their hearts out for Set Alight but no race is won till the winner touches the tape first. However, if she wins, she will also be winning the first ever Indian Derby for Shroff who, in his riding days, had won a record eight Indian Derbies.

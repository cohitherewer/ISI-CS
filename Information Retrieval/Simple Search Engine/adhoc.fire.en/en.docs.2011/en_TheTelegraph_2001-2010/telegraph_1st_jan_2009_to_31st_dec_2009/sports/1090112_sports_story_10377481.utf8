                                                   Still no news on Dhoni
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mahendra Singh Dhoni is yet to inform the East Zone selectors about his availability for the Duleep Trophy.         
	The selectors were forced to keep the Team India captain out of the side after they failed to establish contact with him during the selection committee meeting on Saturday.         
	I havent heard anything from him, national selector Raja Venkat said on Sunday.         
	Even Jodh Singh, the selector from Dhonis state Jharkhand, had told the selection committee in Guwahati that he had no idea of Dhonis whereabouts.         
	Bikas Barua, Assam Cricket Association secretary and convenor of the East Zone team, said they were keeping all options open for the Team India captain.         
	Dhonis is welcome to join the squad anytime He will take charge if he decides to play Duleep Trophy, Barua said.         
	Dhonis unavailability has raised quite a few eyebrows as stalwarts like Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Zaheer Khan had made themselves available for the domestic matches.

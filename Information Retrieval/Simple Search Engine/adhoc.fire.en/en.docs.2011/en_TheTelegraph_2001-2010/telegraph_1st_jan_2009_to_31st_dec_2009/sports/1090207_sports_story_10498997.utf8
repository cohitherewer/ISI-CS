  - Mortaza creates a flutter       A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Mashrafe Mortaza may have stolen the limelight, going for 12 times his base price, at the IPL auctions in Goa on Friday, but his fitness remains a matter of concern.         
	The 25-year-old has often broken down in the middle of a series because of persistent injuries. After making his debut against Zimbabwe in Dhaka in 2001-02, he excelled in the second Test against England in 2003-04, taking 4 for 60. He, however, suffered a twisted knee towards the end of the game that kept him out of Tests for over a year.         
	A persistent back injury caused him to return home early and miss the Test series in Sri Lanka in September 2005  the sixth time he had failed to last throughout a tour  but he was back to face the Australians in April 2006.         
	He also played a key role in Bangladeshs second round appearance in the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies. He again broke down in mid 2007.At his peak, he can be a matchwinner, like when his 4 for 44 set up Bangladeshs maiden ODI win against New Zealand in 2008.         
	Bangladeshs most promising quick has worked with Andy Roberts to improve his accuracy. Young, quick and aggressive, Mashrafe has proved adept at reining in his attacking instincts to concentrate on line and length.

  - Brazilian Edmilson doubtful for match vs Mahindra       OUR CORRESPONDENT            P.C. Lalawmpuiya may replace Edmilson                                 
	Mumbai: The I-League match between table-toppers Chirag United and the in-form Mahindra United at the Cooperage on Tuesday promises to be, well, a battle of attrition rather than a goalfest.         
	The two teams have been in prolific goalscoring form in the four rounds so far but are likely to go into the match without their main poachers  Murithala Ali for the home team and Edmilson Marques for Chirag  taking away much of the sheen from the contest.         
	Ali, along with defenders Denzil Franco and Ravanan, is serving a suspension while Edmilson, who has a groin injury, failed to complete the full training session on the eve of the match.         
	Between them Ali and Edmilson have scored nine goals so far in the league and the Nigerian has struck five of those.         
	Chirag coach Subrata Bhattacharya hasnt yet ruled out Edmilson for the match, but added that his team had a handy replacement in P.C. Lalawmpuiya should it come down to that.         
	It has been a refreshing start to the season for Edmilson who was jettisoned by East Bengal on disciplinary grounds after the IFA Shield this year.         
	I want to score with any coach. This coach (Bhattacharya) has been lucky for me, Edmilson, nicknamed Pardal after a common bird in Brazil, said.         
	The league has already witnessed a couple of hattricks although Okolie Odafe, the golden boot winner from champions Churchill Brothers for the last three seasons, is yet to score one.         
	But Edmilson, with his compatriot Du acting as interpreter, was of the opionion that the goal glut was also because the Indian defenders skills has left a lot to be desired.         
	First of all they have to build their body. They are not eating properly. And then they have to practise a lot of headers because if you have noticed, a lot of goals in India are scored from headers, he said.         
	That should ring a warning bell for the hosts as they would be missing the services of Franco and Ravanan.         
	But if the lack of star power was a dampener, Bhattacharyas expectations from the match poured more cold water on the fans hopes for some entertainment.         
	Tomorrow we would like to be very careful we want to play very safe because we dont want to give away three points, we dont want to lose, the visiting coach said.         
	Mahindra have problems of their own to deal with, though. After being on the brink of victory, Mahindra conceded a last-minute goal to snatch a draw away to Dempo last week.

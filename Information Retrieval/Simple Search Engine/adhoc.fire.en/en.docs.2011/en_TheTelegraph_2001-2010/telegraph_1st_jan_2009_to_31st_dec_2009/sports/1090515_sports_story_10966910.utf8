The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Multiple match-winners in my team, says Sehwag
                                                   Multiple match-winners in my team, says Sehwag
                      
	Durban: The Delhi DareDevils captain Virender Sehwag said Thursday that he has multiple match-winners in the team.         
	I would not say that we are a champion team but yes, we are a good side. We have a balanced side. I think we have the most balanced side in the tournament, Sehwag said.         
	We have different match-winners every time we win. It has been (Daniel) Vettori, (Tillekaratne) Dilshan, (AB) de Villiers, (Dirk) Nannes, (Ashish) Nehra and Rajat Bhatia against Deccan. I have always believed that one player can win you a Twenty20 game. It all depends upon whose day it is, Sehwag said after his sides 12-run win over the Deccan Chargers.         
	Sehwag was all praise for youngsters Pradeep Sangwan and Rajat Bhatia who shared seven Deccan wickets between them to set up the win.         
	Both Rajat and Sangwan bowled very well. I dont think anyone expected Rajat to perform that well. I know Rajats strengths and weaknesses. I knew he can bowl yorkers at the death. It was not easy to hit him as it was pretty windy. And Rajat used the wind beautifully, Sehwag said.         
	He said when Andrew Symonds was going great guns, he thought the Chargers would run away with the game.         
	When Gilchrist and Symonds were batting, we had no chance of winning. The way Symonds was batting, I thought no one would be able to stop him. If he stayed till the end, the match would have got over early. But luckily we got the wickets.         
	About Gilchrist rocking with the bat even after retirement, Sehwag said: Retirement does not take away the talent.         
	I think he retired because his body couldnt handle the pressure of international cricket anymore but in Twenty20, things are different.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Poor start cost us title: Bencharifa
                                                   Poor start cost us title: Bencharifa
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa feels that a better start to the I-League would have resulted in the city giants emerging champions. In the first five games we were nowhere near our optimum. We could not win a single match and that cost us dear. We were unlucky, Karim said on Friday.         
	Mohun Bagan lost two and drew three of their first five matches. Disappointed that the title slipped from their hands, the Moroccan coach said only one win from the initial five matches could have put them in a better position.         
	We did not win any game. Actually the players were tired and we missed four-five of our key players. There was no Bhaichung (Bhutia), no Deepak Mondal or Marcos Even Sangram (Mukherjee) was injured.         
	During the Sporting Clube de Goa the match, some of our shots hit the post, the ground was muddy and the referee gave some bad decisions All went against us, Karim reasoned. But the coach is not bitter. Contented with the teams performance, Karim said he is waiting to extend his contract with the green and maroon brigade.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | West Zone in box seat
                                                     West Zone in box seat
                  Ajinkya Rahane                     
	Chennai: Subramaniam Badrinath stood tall amid ruins before West Zone bundled out South for 199 and stretched their overall lead to 492 runs after day three of the Duleep Trophy final here on Saturday.         
	Having managed a 260-run first innings lead, the dominant West Zone, gunning for their 17th Duleep Trophy title, ended the third day at 232 for four in their second innings with Abhishek Nayar (9) and Kedar Jadhav (4) at the crease.         
	For West, Ajinkya Rahane, who had slammed 165 in the first innings, fell just two runs short of his second century of the match, while Parthiv Patel contributed 64 before cramps forced him to retire hurt.         
	Earlier, resuming on 106 for four, South Zone lost wickets at regular intervals as their batsmen lacked the application and the will to grind it out.         
	With the West spin duo of Ramesh Powar (3/47) and Rajesh Pawar (3/73) running through the middle and lower order, Badrinath (100 ..) could only watch in exasperation as his partners kept changing.         
	His unbeaten 163-ball knock included 10 fours and three sixes.         
	In all, seven South Zone batsmen, including former India captain Rahul Dravid, failed to get into double digits.         
	West Zone lost their captain Wasim Jaffer (15) to Sreesanth in the ninth over but Parthiv and Rahane soon imposed themselves on the South Zone bowlers and scored at a brisk rate. Parthivs progress, however, was halted as the left-hander developed cramps and had to retire hurt.         
	Cheteshwar Pujara (14) could not make the most of yet another opportunity to impress the selectors while Bhavik Thaker (22) got the start but could not convert, falling to Sreesanth.         
	Rahane was in a punishing mood on Saturday as he blasted his way into the 90s before falling to Badrinath.         
	Rahane tried to glance Badrinath but managed a faint nick and wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik took a well-judged catch to send him back.         
	Rahanes 110-ball 98 was studded with 10 fours and four sixes.           (PTI)

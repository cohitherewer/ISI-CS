	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan saved their worst for the last. On Tuesday at the Howrah Stadium, under the blazing mid-summer afternoon sun, a disjointed and seemingly uninterested green and maroon brigade played their worst home tie of the season and lost 0-4 to Al Karamah in the last group match of the AFC Cup. Haani Al Taiar scored a brace (18th amp; 72nd) while Alaa Al Sibli (39th) and Mohammed Alhamwi (60th) netted one each.         
	While Al Karamah earned a berth in the pre-quarter final round with 12 points from six matches, Bagan have the ignominy of ending their AFC Cup campaign without a point. And in six matches they have let in 19 goals, 16 in the last three matches.         
	More than the margin, Bagans abject capitulation was difficult to digest for the motley crowd.         
	Agreed that Bhaichung Bhutias decision to sever ties with the club a day before, coupled with the absence of key players did hamper Bagans chances, but how can one justify the fact that they did not have a single shot on target. How can you justify only a couple of forays into the rival territory in 90 minutes?         
	On the eve of the match, some players, in private, voiced their concern over the effect Bhaichungs decision would have on the outcome of the match. We just hope they dont inflict more damage to our already sagging morale, was the refrain.         
	And as the match wore on, their worst fears came true. Bagan just did not have any clue about what was happening on the field and were rightly punished by the far superior visitors.         
	Coming to the goals, the first one came in the 18th minute. Fahd Aodi, arguably the best player of the day, found an unmarked Haani inside the box. Haanis delectable chip nestled in the net as goalkeeper Shilton Paul watched helplessly.         
	The second came in the 39th. Paul could not get hold of Fahds rasping volley and Alaa made no mistakes in tapping it in off the rebound.         
	The third came on the hour mark. Pauls feeble clearance off Fahds free-kick landed in front of Alhamwi. As the Bagan defenders did not look interested in marking their rivals, Alhamwi made amends for his earlier misses with a smart finish.         
	The last one came in the 72nd minute. An overlapping Y. Shaheen found Haani inside the box and the latter scored smartly. The rout was complete and it was time for Bagan to end their season.

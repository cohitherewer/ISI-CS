	Buenos Aires: Argentina are favourites to come out on top of Wednesdays three-way race for South Americas remaining World Cup place and a playoff berth. When the Argentines meet Uruguay at the iconic Centenario in Montevideo needing a draw to secure their place at the 2010 finals there will, however, be no certainties.         
	Three South American teams have secured berths at next years World Cup and, in the final round of qualifying Wednesday, three more will have a shot at making it to South Africa.         
	Brazil, Paraguay and Chile have already qualified for the World Cup, leaving Argentina, Uruguay and Ecuador to decide the last remaining direct qualification from the region.         
	The fifth-placed finisher earns a playoff with the No.4 North and Central America and the Caribbean side for another berth. The opponent will be either Costa Rica or Honduras.         
	Going into Wednesday, Argentina have 25 points, Uruguay 24 and Ecuador 23.         
	Ecuador play at Chile. In three other matches that have no bearing on World Cup berths, its Peru vs. Bolivia, Brazil vs. Venezuela and Paraguay vs. Colombia.         
	Argentina are in the best position, thanks to Saturdays 2-1 victory over Peru in which Martin Palermo scored in the third minute of injury time  in a driving rainstorm  to give the underperforming regional powerhouse the victory at River Plates Monumental stadium. Peru, have been the weakest in the qualifiers, having won only two of 17 matches.         
	Palermo, who entered as a second-half substitute, may have saved Argentina from missing their first World Cup since 1970.         
	Palermo celebrated the goal by pulling off his shirt and raising his arms skyward in the downpour. At the same moment, embattled Argentina coach Diego Maradona dived headfirst into the soaking wet pitch  as if hed just scored the goal.         
	This lets us go to Montevideo at bit more relaxed, said Barcelona striker Lionel Messi.         
	If Argentina beat Uruguay at Montevideo on Wednesday, the two-time champions advance to the World Cup. Same for Uruguay; a victory and they go to South Africa.         
	For Argentina, a draw might be enough to finish fourth, and they can even lose and still have a shot at the playoff spot.         
	For Uruguay, a draw would only be enough for a possible finish in fifth place  and a playoff in November. Uruguay might even reach the playoff with a loss.         
	Ecuador are the wild cards.         
	If Ecuador beat Chile, they will finish at least fifth and earn a playoff. Ecuador could also get the automatic spot. For that to happen, Argentina and Uruguay have to draw and Ecuador have to beat Chile by at least five goals.

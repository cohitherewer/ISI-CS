                                                     Shock exit for Arvind Bhat
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Chetan Anand                           
	Mumbai: National champion Arvind Bhat crashed out of the Tata Open all-India senior ranking badminton tournament after being handed a shock first round defeat on Friday.         
	Second seed Bhat, who reached the pre-quarters of the Malaysian Open last week, went down 19-21, 16-21 to Tanishaq K of Andhra Pradesh at the CCI courts.         
	Tanishaq, 27, had come through four rounds of qualifying but showed little signs of weariness as he controlled the crucial points well to score the first upset of the tournament.         
	After a tight first game, Tanishaq gained an 11-6 lead in the second. Bhat fought back to narrow the gap to 16-15, but then Tanishaq raised his game to shut the door on his rival.         
	Later in the evening, Tanishaq subdued Mohit Kamat for a 21-19, 21-19 victory in the second round that saw him make the quarter finals.         
	The competition is the last opportunity for the Indian players to find form ahead of the World Championships in Hyderabad next month but Bhat wasnt that worried by his loss.         
	The good thing about me is I easily forget the bad matches. I am still confident about myself, he said.         
	Top seed Chetan Anand faced little problem as he cruised to the quarter finals, beating Pavan Malik 21-11, 21-12 in the first round and Vinak Kumar Reddy 21-15, 21-13 in the second.         
	There were fewer surprises in the womens draw, except for the seasoned Trupti Murgunde packing off seventh seed Anjali Kalita in the first round.         
	Murgunde would surely have felt it was her day when she was given a walkover after her second round opponent Rima Jhaveri withdrew.         
	Jhaveri and her mixed doubles partner Deepak Jaitley had conceded their first round match due to an injury to the latter earlier in the day.         
	It maybe noted that the Indian badminton administration has tightened the rules in the wake of numerous withdrawals from tournaments, making a player pulling out of an event citing injury ineligible to play in the remaining disciplines of the particular tournament.

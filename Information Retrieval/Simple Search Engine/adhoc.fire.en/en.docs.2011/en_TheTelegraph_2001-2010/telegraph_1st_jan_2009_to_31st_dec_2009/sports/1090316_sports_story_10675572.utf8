                                                   Churchill beat Mumbai FC 3-2 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Churchill Brothers overcame a resilient Mumbai FC to score a thrilling 3-2 win and go on top of the I-League, here on Sunday. Prolific scorer Okolie Odafe netted the winner in the 86th minute, but it was L Robert who proved to be the key for Churchill with his magical left foot, his two free kicks in either half being instrumental in the visitors first two goals.         
	Robert nearly spoilt his good work with an own goal in the 84th minute which enabled Mumbai FC to make it 2-2. But Odafe ensured that the hosts joy was shortlived as he struck immediately after.         
	Churchill now have 39 points, same as Sporting Clube de Goa, but are ahead on goal difference. The match was off to an explosive start when Mumbai FC took the lead in the 15th minute through Anees Kutty.         
	Churchill equalised in the 27th minute. Roberts curling free-kick crashed into the net as Mumbai FC goalkeeper Kalyan Chaubey had no clue, whatsoever. After the change of ends, Roberts low free-kick found Naoba Singh smartly heading it into the far corner.         
	Trailing 1-2, David Booths men turned on the heat. The effort bore fruit when Robert, trying to clear a soft touch from Abel Hammond, ended up driving it into his own net.

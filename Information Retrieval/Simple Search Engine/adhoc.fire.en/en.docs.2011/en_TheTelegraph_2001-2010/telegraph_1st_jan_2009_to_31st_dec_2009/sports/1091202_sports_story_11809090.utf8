	Paris: Barcelona and Argentina forward Lionel Messi was awarded the 2009 Golden Ball, said on Tuesday.         
	The 22-year-old finished ahead of last years winner Cristiano Ronaldo by a record 240-point margin, with his Barcelona teammate Xavi in third.         
	Messi becomes the first Argentine to win the Ballon dOr, although Argentine-born players Alfredo di Stefano and Omar Sivori, then regarded as Europeans, received the trophy when it was still called the European Footballer of the Year award.         
	Its a great honour for me to be voted (as winner of the) Golden Ball and to become the first Argentine in history to receive this award, Messi was quoted as saying on a French soccer magazine.         
	The award caps a brilliant year for the soft-spoken left-footer, who helped treble-winning Barcelona lift the Champions League title with nine goals, as well as bagging 23 in the league and six in the Kings Cup.         
	I knew I was among the favourites, because Barca have had a prolific year and we won everything, but I didnt expect to win it by such a huge margin, Messi added.         
	The awards 96 jurors gave Messi 473 points out of a possible 480, a near unanimous verdict, the magazine said.         
	Portugals Ronaldo picked up 233 points in the vote by journalists from across the world, now open to players from all leagues and nationalities, with Spains Xavi tallying 170 points.         
	The jurors rewarded Barcelonas exciting brand of soccer with fourth and fifth place for Andres Iniesta and Samuel Eto, now at Inter Milan, respectively.         
	The Golden Ball is something very important for me, Messi said after his name was added to a list featuring all-time greats such as Johan Cruyff, Franz Beckenbauer, Michel Platini and Zinedine Zidane.         
	All those who won it were great players and some great players never won it, added the Argentine, who will receive the award at a ceremony in Paris on Sunday.         
	Diego Maradona, now the Argentina coach, would probably have won it several times had it been open to non-European players in the 1980s.         
	The first player from outside Europe to win the Golden Ball was Liberias George Weah in 1995.         
	Italian and German players have featured prominently in the standings over the years but neither country had a player on this years 30-strong shortlist.         
	The other country apart from Spain to have two players in the top 10 was England with Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard placing eighth and 10th respectively. (Reuters)

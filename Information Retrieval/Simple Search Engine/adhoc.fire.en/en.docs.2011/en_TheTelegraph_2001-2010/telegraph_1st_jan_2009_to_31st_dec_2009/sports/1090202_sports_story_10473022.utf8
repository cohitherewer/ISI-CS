The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania: Hope the game back home   gets a fillip
                                                   Sania: Hope the game back home   gets a fillip
                            
	Melbourne: Sania Mirza and Mahesh Bhupathi needed less than an hour to tame Nathalie Dechy and Andy Ram 6-3, 6-1 in the Australian Open mixed doubles final on Sunday.         
	After winning her first Grand Slam title a day after Yuki Bhambri won the boys singles crown, Sania believes the game is poised to reach the next level in India.               
	The following are excerpts               
	How much of an impact would the two titles (mixed doubles and boys singles) at the Australian Open have back home?         
	Lets hope a lot. You know, its great. I dont remember the last time when we had so many. I mean, Bhupathi played the mens doubles finals, we won today, Yuki won. Its been a great two weeks. Lets hope a lot more people play, and tennis grows. Hope that Indian tennis gets a fillip from these feats.         
	On a personal level, what does the win mean?         
	Its always a dream to win a Grand Slam. Thats what we all play for. Its just great. What makes it more special is that its with someone who I know for so long and so well. Its a feeling that you cant really describe. Its a dream come true.         
	On the partnership with Bhupathi         
	Its great. What can you say? Weve been playing for, I think, four or five Slams now. We came very close last year, as well. We did one better this time. We hope to continue.         
	On the final         
	I think we both played really well today. Honestly, I was a little surprised because it was my first Grand Slam final But I think we stepped it up after the first few games, and then suddenly we were on a roll.         
	I think Ive been hitting the ball really well over the last few days. Yeah, it helps when your partner helps you out so much, when you make a couple of returns and hes flying at the net.         
	How has the injury-prone wrist responded to the challenge here?         
	The wrist has held up. Thats the biggest positive.         
	The feeling while serving for the title         
	While serving, I was trying to block that score out. I wasnt really looking at the scoreboard and thinking, Oh, its 5-1, Im serving for the championship. I was just trying to serve it out like it was any other game.         
	Expectations from fans will increase in 2009         
	Every year you go into the season with new aims. So that is nothing new. We strive to better ourselves and I will continue to do that. There could not have been a better start to the new season.         
	It is confidence booster but I am just enjoying the moment. I dont want to look much into the future. Right now am just happy to have won a Slam.

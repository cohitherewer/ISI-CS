The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan begin with a bang
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bagan begin with a bang
  - Barreto brace in 4-1 drubbing of Md. Sp.       OUR CORRESPONDENT                                  
	Guwahati: Defending champions Mohun Bagan started their campaign in style, thrashing qualifiers Mohammedan Sporting 4-1 in an all-Calcutta inaugural match of the 31st Federation Cup at the Nehru Stadium Monday.         
	The holders started on an attacking note right from the word go to take a 2-1 lead at half-time.         
	But the team lost momentum midway till they came back strongly in the last few minutes to find the opposition net twice in quick succession.         
	Brazilian striker Jose Ramirez Barreto drew first blood in as early as the sixth minute with a header off a centre by L. James Singh.         
	Having conceded an early lead, Sporting went all out for the equaliser with concerted effort in counter-offensives but were ably tackled by the Bagan defence till skipper Jothi Kumar found the equaliser with a solo effort in the 33rd minute.         
	He intercepted a rebound by playmaker Theodore Sunday at the goalmouth and caught opponent custodian Sangram Mukherjee off-guard with a half-volley.         
	The status quo, however, did not last long as Japanese recruit Ryuji Sueoka found the net in the 41st minute for Bagans second with a header off a cross, this time from James Singh.         
	The second session was as competitive as the first but Sporting came undone in the dying minutes.         
	Barreto struck again for his second goal in the 89th, taking advantage of a goalmouth melee to slot home a pass from Edeh Chidi.         
	Chidi also had his share of success when he scored Bagans fourth in the final minute of injury time, capitalising on a defensive lapse.         
	It was a good start for us I would say better than last time. All our star players have scored, which is good, said coach Karim Bencherifa.

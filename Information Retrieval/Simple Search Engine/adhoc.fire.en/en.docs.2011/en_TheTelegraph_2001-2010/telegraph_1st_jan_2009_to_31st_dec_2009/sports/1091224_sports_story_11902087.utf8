            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Barreto                           
	Guwahati: Chirag Uniteds run in the ongoing Hero Honda 31st Federation Cup is over after a goalless draw against Mohun Bagan in a must-win group B match at the Nehru Stadium Wednesday.         
	In a match reminiscent of Chirags shocking 3-2 defeat of Bagan in the I-League recently, the green-and-maroon brigade were pushed on to the backfoot with Chirags attacking strategy.         
	And midway into the first session, Bagan mid-fielder Snehashish Chakraborty left the field after injuring his elbow while tackling Parveen Kumar.         
	However, in the second-half, Bagan cameback strongly to make repeated forays into the opponent castle which, however, went in vain as most of the raids did not yield any result due to poor finishing.         
	Bagans foreign recruits  Jose Ramirez Barreto, Edeh Chidi and Ryuiji Sueoka disappointed the crowd squandering several open chances during the last few minutes of the match.         
	Meanwhile, in the group D matches on Thursday, Shillongs Lajong FC will face Dempo SC while Pune FC will lock horns with Air India.         
	Teams         
	Mohun Bagan: Sangram Mukherjee, Biswajit Saha, Sk Azim, Surkumar Singh, James Singh (Tomba Singh, 62), Ryuiji Sueoka, Rakesh Masih, Snehashish Chakraborty (Isfaq Ahmed, 37), Edeh Chidi, Jose Barreto, Sangram Mandi.         
	Chirag: Somnath Khara, Eduardo, Narugopal Hait, Denson Devadas, Jayanta Sen, Gouranga Biswas (Gouranga Dutta, 69), Parveen Kumar (Safar Sardar, 78), Hardeep Singh, 90), Edmilson Marques, Rahul Kumar, Kinsuk Devnath, S. Malsawmtluanga.         
	Referee: H Khamba Singh.

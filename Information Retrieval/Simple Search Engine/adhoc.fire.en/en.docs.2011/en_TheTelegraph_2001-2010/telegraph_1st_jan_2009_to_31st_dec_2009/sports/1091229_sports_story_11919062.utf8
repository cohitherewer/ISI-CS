            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Watching the India-Sri Lanka one-dayer get abandoned at the Kotla on Sunday was the biggest blow Radhey Shyam Sharma has received in his seventy-three years.         
	A few months ago, I underwent bypass surgery. Believe me, I wasnt too bothered, said Radhey Shyam, considered one of the best curators in India.         
	But when I saw what was going on at Kotla, it was like a deadly blow to me. Till a few months back, experts regarded this wicket as the best in the country.         
	Digging up the wicket, according to Radhey Shyam, was the biggest blunder.         
	The wicket was good enough the way it was. But the curator (Vijay Bahadur Mishra) and his men decided to make a new one, he said.         
	Whats worse, they decided to put new grass on it. That proved dangerous. They brought in a grass expert from a golf course and spend a lot of money. Now look what has happened to the pitch, he said.         
	What was the reason for re-laying a wicket that had behaved so well even during the IPL he asked.         
	So embarrassed were the DDCA officials that, on Monday, they hurriedly reinstated Radhey Shyam and asked him to quickly make the pitch playable, before the limited overs match Tuesday, between the DDCA under-14 team and a school team from England.         
	Radhey Shyam, who got down to work almost immediately, has assured he will do his best.         
	I am only called when there is something wrong with the pitch, said Radhey Shyam. In 1999, when some hooligans dug up the pitch before the tour of Pakistan, I re-laid it in just 22 days.         
	Similarly, I was called in 2005 when there were huge doubts over the pitch. As the Pakistan president was to watch the tie, they got panicky and called me to do prepare the pitch.         
	Although the members of the now disbanded grounds and pitches committee of the DDCA are refusing to speak to the media, one of them, on condition of anonymity, told The Telegraph that not everything was wrong with the pitch.         
	Please dont paint us villains. Barring a few, all members of the new group that worked under Mishra were dedicated, he said. Perhaps the only thing they lacked was experience. They didnt have any idea about the amount of watering the pitch needed.         
	Also, they tried to prepare the pitch too quickly. Patience was Radhey Shyams watchword. At one go, he would only make five to six feet and wait for the result.         
	Another member said that the ground staff faced regular humiliation by the pitch committee members. One of them, an engineer, had even said that ordinary labourers could do the ground staffs job.

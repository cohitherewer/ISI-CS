The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Graeme Smith eyes Twenty20 glory
                                                   Graeme Smith eyes Twenty20 glory
                      
	London: After gaining the numero uno status in the one-day Internationals (ODI), South Africa are now keen to lay their hands on the Twenty20 World Cup as well, according to captain Graeme Smith.         
	Smith pointed to South Africas away Test series win in Australia and England, apart from the ODI glory, and said that he would love to cap it by winning the ICC World T20 title on June 21.         
	We have had a wonderful past 12 months including winning away Test series in both England and Australia and winning home and away ODI series against Australia to gain the top spot in the ICC world rankings, he said.         
	One of the boxes we still want to tick is to win a major ICC championship and we have two chances to do that  in the ICC World T20 next month and again in the ICC Champions Trophy which will be held in South Africa at the end of September, Smith said.

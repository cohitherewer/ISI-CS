The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Waited for my chance: Sreesanth
                                                                                                                       7                                      Waited for my chance: Sreesanth
  - Am indebted to Donald for his support... He taught me the importance of work ethics       OUR CORRESPONDENT                            
	Kanpur: It was a dream comeback for Sreesanth. But the pacer, by his own admission, had given up hope of representing his country again. After having played his part to perfection during third days play, he is now determined to make this new beginning count.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Too good to be true         
	Its like coming full circle. I played my last international on this very ground. Feels great to start afresh at the same venue. Frankly, after all that happened last year, I felt Id never play for India again. But thanks to BCCI that it showed faith in me. Also, the tremendous support I got from my teammates.         
	Whether he had anticipated a call to the playing XI         
	Not really... I just concentrated on training hard and waited for my chance. That is what I am supposed to do. I didnt let anything else work on my mind.         
	Any change in mindset         
	Its just that I am enjoying my game a lot more nowadays. It feels good when I am running up to bowl. Earlier, I would set some unachievable goals but now Im much more realistic about targets.         
	Which is more memorable, Kanpur or Johannesburg         
	The five for 40 at Johannesburg is now history. That day (in Johannesburg) I didnt have to do much. The conditions were conducive to seam bowling. I just hit the deck hard and the rest fell in place. Here, the wicket was not suited to my type of bowling. I had to bring about a few variations The wicket was slow. So, had I tried bowling faster, the batsman wouldve had no difficulty. The most important aspect was to keep the seam position right and bowl at around 130-135 kmph.         
	The influence of Allan Donald         
	The best decision I took was to go play for Warwickshire during the English summer. I am indebted to Donald for his support. Apart from him, I would also like to thank former England spinner and Warwickshire coach Ashley Giles for his support. Donald told me how I should be more responsible on and off the field. He taught me the importance of work ethics and good habits. He would tell me that even if I dont like it, I should go off to sleep early. Even if its biting cold, I need to get into the swimming pool.         
	Harbhajan Singh...         
	Bhajji (Harbhajan) is like an elder brother and I look up to him. I am indebted to him and Virender Sehwag for taking utmost care in maintaining the shine of the ball as the outfield was a rough one. If I have been able to get a fair amount of reverse swing, it is because of them.         
	A misunderstood man         
	I would say yes to a large extent. But I am the same man. I havent changed but yes I have learnt to curb my emotions. Today, I dont have the selfish motive of playing for myself. I know that my main purpose should be to contribute for my team.         
	Any message for the countrymen on the anniversary of 26/11         
	Love all and serve all. Thats the best way to do it. We cant change what has happened but we can learn from past mistakes. Thats the only way we can move on.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | DareDevils go down to Jakati
                                                   DareDevils go down to Jakati
                      
	Johannesburg: Left-arm spinner Shadab Jakati took four wickets for 24 as the Chennai Super Kings beat the Delhi DareDevils by 18 runs in a thrilling Indian Premier League (IPL) match here on Saturday.         
	The 28-year-old Jakati was the unlikely star of the night as he turned the match on its head.         
	Chasing a target of 164, Delhi could score only 145 in 20 overs.         
	Jakati claimed Delhis twin half centurions David Warner (51) and Dinesh Karthik (52), besides the in-form Tillekaratne Dilshan (13) to help Mahendra Singh Dhonis side register their third win in seven matches in the tournament.         
	Subramaniam Badrinath top-scored with 45 while Suresh Raina made 32 as the Chennai Super Kings were bowled out for 163 by the Delhi DareDevils.         
	Opening bowlers Dirk Nannes and Ashish Nehra produced sharp swing and good variation of pace and each returned with identical figures of three for 27 from their four overs, while medium pacer Rajat Bhatia claimed two for 17 from three overs.

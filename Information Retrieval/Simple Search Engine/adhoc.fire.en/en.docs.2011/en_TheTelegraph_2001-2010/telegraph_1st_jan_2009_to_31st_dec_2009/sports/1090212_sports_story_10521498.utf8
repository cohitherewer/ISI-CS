The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Prince kept out by Duminy
                                                   Prince kept out by Duminy
                      
	Johannesburg: J.P. Duminy has retained his place ahead of Ashwell Prince in South Africas squad named on Wednesday for the first two home Tests against Australia.         
	Middle-order batsman Duminy, 24, replaced the injured Prince in the recent series victory in Australia and made a superb 166 to help his side win the second Test in Melbourne.         
	Prince struck an unbeaten 162 in his last Test innings to rescue South Africa against Bangladesh and he scored 900 runs at an average of 64.28 in 2008.         
	Theres been a lot of speculation about the whole JP/Ashwell situation, so we decided to name the squad early to maintain the stability of the team and give confidence to the players, whove done so well for us, convenor of selectors Mike Procter said on Wednesday.         
	Ashwell is seriously unlucky, he scored over 160 in his last Test when we were in trouble and also did fantastic work in England, Procter said.         
	There had been speculation in South Africa that opening batsman Neil McKenzie, who averaged just 24.20 in the three Tests in Australia, would make way for Prince in a reshuffled batting order.         
	The squad         
	Graeme Smith (captain), Neil McKenzie, Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers, J.P. Duminy, Mark Boucher, Paul Harris, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Makhaya Ntini, Lonwabo Tsotsobe.

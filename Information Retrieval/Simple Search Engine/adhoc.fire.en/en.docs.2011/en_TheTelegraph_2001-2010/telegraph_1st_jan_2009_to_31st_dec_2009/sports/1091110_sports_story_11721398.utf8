            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal cricket isnt short of controversies. Chairman of selection committee, Sambaran Banerjees presence at the team meeting on Monday, at the Eden, has not gone down well with the think tank.         
	No one was willing to be quoted, but the players, too, havent taken it sportingly. Banerjee decided to attend the meeting after practice on his own.         
	He had no business being at the team meeting. That is strictly for the players and the support staff, said a senior CAB office-bearer. Banerjee, however, didnt find anything wrong with the move. Ive attended team meetings previously, too So its nothing new, he said.         
	It may be recalled that former coach Utpal Chatterjee had also taken strong exception to his presence during team meetings last season.         
	For the record, the national selectors, too, are never a part of team meetings. According to the protocol, the selectors on tour are part of the extended Team India, but even then, they dont attend team meetings.

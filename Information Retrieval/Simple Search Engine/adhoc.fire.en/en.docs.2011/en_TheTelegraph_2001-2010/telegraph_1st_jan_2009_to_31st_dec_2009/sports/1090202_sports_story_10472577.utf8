                                                     Bagan soar after early snag 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Barreto                           
	Mumbai: Mohun Bagan extended their winning streak after Jose Barreto struck twice to give them a come-from-behind 2-1 win against Air India in a round 13 I-League match at the Cooperage here Sunday.         
	The Brazilian headed in a corner-kick in the first half added time to help Bagan cancel out Subash Singhs 19th minute strike before producing a piece of samba magic, firing a right-foot drive from a narrow angle into the hosts net in the second half.         
	It was Bagans eighth win in a row, a feat that has them tied with East Bengal for the most number of wins on the trot. The red and gold brigade had enjoyed a similar run in the 1998-99 season.         
	The victory took Bagans tally to 27 points, and also helped them close in on league leaders Sporting Clube de Goa who are now just a point ahead of the green and maroon brigade. Air India have 17 points and are placed sixth.         
	Bagan were shackled by Air India initially but the goal by Subash seemed to shake them up.         
	The Air India forward scored after receiving a pass from Kailash Patil who built on a fine move in combination with Gauranga Biswas.         
	But then the Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa changed his tactics. The Moroccan asked his two star strikers, Barreto and captain Bhaichung Bhutia to play a bit wider from each other upfront so that he could prevent the rival defence from initiating moves on the flanks.         
	The equaliser came in the nick of time in the first half. But then Air India made the cardinal sin of leaving Barreto unmarked and the stalwart had no problem in scoring from the set-piece.         
	The second goal was in a different league altogether. After running wide, Barreto struck, with both instinct and imagination. Fortunately for him, he found the angle to beat the goalkeeper.         
	Air India piled on the pressure in the last 15 minutes but their luck had deserted them.         
	The hosts then suffered the ignominy of having Uttam Singh sent off for a second yellow card for a rough tackle in stoppage time.         
	Meanwhile, Churchill Brothers came from behind to hold Dempo to a 1-1 draw in another 13th round match at the Nehru stadium here Sunday.         
	Churchill found the equaliser in the 72nd minute through Felix Chimaokwu after Dempo had taken the lead in the 45th minute through Anthony Pereira.

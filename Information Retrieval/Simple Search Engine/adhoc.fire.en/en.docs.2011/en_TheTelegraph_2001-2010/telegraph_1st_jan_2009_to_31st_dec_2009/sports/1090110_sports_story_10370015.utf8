                                                   Rueful Leslie agrees with Pataudi
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former India hockey captain Leslie Walter Claudius endorses M.A.K. Pataudis view and feels that cricket should be made the national game given the recent performance of Team India.         
	Talking to The Telegraph on Friday, when asked whether it would be right to make cricket the national game, the 82-year old Olympian said: Why not? The Indian team is playing brilliant cricket. They have a huge fan following We are producing so many fine players. Its high time cricket is made the national game. I am in complete support of Pataudi.         
	According to Claudius, hockey in Bengal is almost a dead game. With schools, colleges and other educational institutes scrapping their hockey teams, the veteran Olympian feels its only a matter of time before people forget the game here in the city.         
	Bengal hockey is particularly dead. There is no exposure to the game here, he added.

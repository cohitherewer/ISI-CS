                                                   Murray eliminated, Federer advances
                      
	Rome: Andy Murray lost for the fourth time this year, falling to Argentine qualifier Juan Monaco 6-1, 3-6, 5-7 Wednesday in his opening match at the Rome Masters. World No. 4 Murray easily won the first set but then began to miss more first serves and commit more unforced errors, while Monaco won several points with an effective drop shot. Monaco will next face 15th-seeded Marin Cilic after the Croat defeated Christophe Rochus of Belgium 6-0, 5-7, 6-2.         
	World No. 2 Roger Federer edged past big-serving Ivo Karlovic 6-4, 6-4. Karlovic fired 15 aces to Federers one, but Federer still managed to break the big Croat early in each set. Federer saved all three break points he faced and committed only 16 unforced errors to Karlovics 38.         
	In another upset, Jurgen Melzer of Austria eliminated seventh-seeded Nikolay Davydenko 7-5, 7-6 (7-5).         
	In the first round, held over from Tuesday due to rain, Richard Gasquet beat ninth-seeded Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7-6 (7-2), 6-4 while Paul-Henri Mathieu of France beat 11th-seeded David Ferrer 6-3, 2-6, 6-2.         
	Also, 16th-seeded Radek Stepanek edged past Florent Serra of France, 7-6 (1), 4-6, 7-5.           (AP)

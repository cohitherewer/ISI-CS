                                                   Manoj eyes berth in T20 Cup
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Manoj Tiwary wants to use the second edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) as a platform to earn a call-up to the India squad for the ICC World Twenty20 in England in June.         
	Its a big chance for me. I want to have a good tournament in South Africa and that will help me to be on the radar for selection to the Twenty20 World Cup squad, the Delhi DareDevils player said at Eden Gardens on Wednesday.         
	Manoj, who left for the capital in the evening, said that there would be a four-day camp in Delhi before leaving for Cape Town  the DareDevils base  on April 5.         
	Manoj said he was watching the South Africa versus Australia series with great keenness. I am trying to figure out how the pitches would be there. And making adjustments to my batting accordingly, he said.         
	Manoj felt his experience of playing Down Under during last years tri-series would help him. I am not new to playing top-class cricket in foreign countries, he said.

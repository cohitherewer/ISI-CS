                                                     Schumacher: Dont write Ferrari off
                  Michael Schumacher                     
	Frankfurt: Former Formula One champion Michael Schumacher says Ferrari should never be written off, even though his former team has not won a point in the first three races this season.         
	We recognise the situation but we are not giving up, said Schumacher, who is still employed by Ferrari as an adviser.         
	Ferrari never did that in the past. You should never write off Ferrari, Schumacher said in an interview with a German news agency. Thats the good thing about Formula One, there is no time for frustration, you always look ahead.         
	But Schumacher conceded that there may not be much Ferrari can do to improve the performance of its current car, since the use of the wind tunnel and computer simulations has been limited by new cost-cutting regulations.         
	Before, we would do double, triple shifts, but this year its not possible, he said.         
	At some point, Schumacher said, the team will have to decide whether to continue trying to improve the car or start early on next seasons model.         
	Schumacher said the most successful teams so far, Brawn GP and Red Bull, had started work on the present car very early. Brawn cars won the first two races and their success should not attributed solely to the diffuser, Schumacher said. The reliability of their cars is the most astonishing thing Ive ever seen, the German said in the interview conducted in his Swiss residence.         
	Another reason for the success of so-called small teams is that they are not so much smaller anymore. Theyve built structures that are no different form the top teams. Theyve closed the gap, Schumacher said.         
	Speaking about his own future with Ferrari, Schumacher said a decision on whether he would extend his contract was unlikely before the end of summer. His contract as adviser expires at the end of the year.         
	There have not been any signals from either side, because there have been no concrete talks and there wont be any in the near future. I think we will talk after the summer about what makes sense and what not, the seven-time champion said.         
	Schumacher came under fire in Italy for some questionable decisions in the early races. The fact is that we made decisions that were wrong, Schumacher said. I, too, made the wrong estimate, no doubt. Its one thing to sit in the car and observe things or to do it from the box.

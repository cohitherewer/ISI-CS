The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brendon let off with a reprimand
                                                   Brendon let off with a reprimand
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders captain, Brendon McCullum, was let off with a severe reprimand by Match Referee S. Venkatraghavan on Sunday, for showing dissent over an umpires decision in their match against the Deccan Chargers on Saturday.         
	McCullum may have escaped a harsher punishment because of his public apology at the post-match presentation ceremony.         
	I apologise for our behaviour during the match today (Saturday). It wasnt certainly the ideal the one and I regret reacting like that. There was a contrast of opinions to what unfolded. I guess we will debate long and hard into the night and probably for the next couple of weeks as well. But thats cricket sometimes things dont go your way. You dont always get those 50-50 decisions in your favour, McCullum had said.         
	After hearing all the evidence and reviewing the match footage at a hearing held in Johannesburg, the Match Referee decided that McCullum and his team, the Knight Riders, were indeed guilty of showing on-field dissent, as reported by umpires S. Ravi and Rudi Koertzen.         
	On-field dissent by a player is a Level 1 offence and is a direct breach of the IPL Code of Conduct for Players as per the Laws of the Game. This being McCullums first offence, he was let off with a severe reprimand, said the press release.         
	The Knight Riders will take on the Chennai Super Kings in their next match on Monday.

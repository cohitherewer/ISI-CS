The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rejoicing in No.1 status
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rejoicing in No.1 status
            OUR CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES                                  
	The work of years and a dream of decades was fulfilled Sunday when the team became the No.1 Test side in the world. Indeed, it is a moment to savour and cherish but current Team India players and veterans alike know that with the ranking comes greater pressure, the one to perform.         
	Following are what some of the former players have to say on Indias ascent (alphabetically).         
	Bishan Singh Bedi: Congratulations to all members of Team India for their superb performance. They have made it possible. It has taken a long time for them and, right now, its a proud moment to cherish... I would like to credit Sachin Tendulkar, Dravid and Virender Sehwag. (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni, to my mind, is a very lucky man to have all these greats playing under him.         
	Rahul Dravid: Its a reflection of our consistency. I dont want so much fuss about the ranking but we have been competitive against the top teams and successful as well. If we keep doing well, consistently, the ranking will take care of itself.         
	Ajay Jadeja: A great achievement. The kind of team he (Dhoni) has, its great. Had this team not been there, he would not have been that successful a captain.         
	Erapalli Prasanna: It is a wonderful victory. It is gratifying to witness a great effort by the team, especially since its coming for the first time in history. There is going to be added pressure on the team now. We need to do a lot of homework from now on to sustain that position with the knowledge that other countries are also developing faster.         
	Yuvraj Singh: Its a great feeling but its going to be difficult to stay at the top. We have expressed our concerns (regarding playing fewer Tests), now its BCCIs call.         
	Krishnamachari Srikkanth: Anil Kumble led the side ably and did a great job after Rahul Dravid had relinquished captaincy. I dont need to comment on his performance as a bowler. At the same time, you have to remember Sourav Ganguly. Sourav was an attacking captain right from the start and even in his last series against Australia, his contribution with the bat was crucial for the team.         
	Jawagal Srinath: India have been playing pretty well in the last 3-4 years. I am very pleased with the effort they have put in to become the No.1 Test side. Now, I want them to continue with the good run and maintain the ranking for the next couple of years.         
	Ajit Wadekar: Dhoni and his men have realised the dream of past masters of the game like me. Each of us, who has played for the country had dreamt of India being the top team in Tests. I congratulate the current bunch of Indian cricketers.

                                                     Spring in EB step
            A STAFF REPORTER            Syed Rahim Nabi with Sunil Chetri Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: The season has changed. You can feel it in the air, you can see it in their steps. As spring makes its arrival in the city, the sunshine  bright and benevolent  is seemingly on East Bengal. Its no longer those gloomy winter days when everything looked so bleak, so dismal. There are smiles, there is that friendly banter which was long missing and there is that confidence. Confidence, which is so in-your-face it can scare you.         
	Buoyed by a hattrick of wins in the ongoing I-League  the last one was so dramatic that it has thrown the league wide open  the red and gold brigade have now the swagger of a champion. Well, they may not be champs in the end, but the mood in the camp is whats the harm in thinking?         
	No wonder, Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali, the team East Bengal square off against in an I-League match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday, concedes that Subhas Bhowmicks boys are the favourites. Even their second eleven can run over any team, says Shabbir.         
	But then, a thin line separates confidence from over-confidence. And if you cross the line, it can be disastrous.         
	Subhas says he is aware of that. So it was not surprising, on the eve of the match, to hear Subhas harping on how important it will be to keep complacency out of the system. Its very necessary to keep our feet firmly on the ground. All the cheer will come to nought if we fail against Mohammedan Sporting, Subhas said at a news conference on Friday.         
	Subhass wariness comes from the fact that Mohammedan Sporting have one Mike Okoro, who on his day can spoil East Bengals party. The Mohammedan Sporting skipper, who thrived under Subhas during his East Bengal days, may not be in his best form but still has the ability to be the deciding factor.         
	East Bengal will retain the team that featured against Mohun Bagan, barring Mehrajuddin Wadoo, who is serving a match-ban for double booking. So, Nirmal Chetri will partner skipper M. Suresh at the centre of the defence. The frontline is looking more vibrant with Sunil Chetri and Yusif Yakubu forging a good understanding. Subhas says, its not just the frontline  10 goals in three matches  which is firing. Everyone has a role in this resurgence.         
	Agrees Rennedy Singh: Its a team game. We all have contributed to this winning run. Rennedy, whose deliveries helped Syed Rahim Nabi get both his goals, was practising set-pieces.         
	I am enjoying once again, he said smilingly before sprinting off to his car.         
	The spring is back in East Bengals step; you cant miss that.

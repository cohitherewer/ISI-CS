The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan need a draw today 
                                                   Bagan need a draw today 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagans IFA Shield match against Mahindra United on Sunday, at their home ground, may be rescheduled for Monday at the artificial turf of Salt Lake if the weather does not improve on the morrow.         
	IFA sources said that the match commissioner will take the final call but going by the relentless rain it is unlikely that the match will start.         
	Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa voiced his concern over the slushy turf and said that Saturdays match has deteriorated the ground further.         
	Bagan need just a draw to enter the semi-finals, while Mahindra will have to earn full points.         
	Bagans Marcos Pereira and Edeh Chidi, are doubtful for the Sunday show. While Marcos played with fever against George Telegraph, Chidi is having excruciating pain in his both ears.         
	Mahindra have been bolstered by the return of Steven Dias, NP Pradeep, Sushil Singh and Subhasish Roy Choudhury.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Must win for Victoria
                                                   Must win for Victoria
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Delhi DareDevils victory against Sri Lankas Wayamba Elevens Sunday night has brought about a total change in the complexion of Group D in the Champions League T20.         
	While the lone win put the local team in the Super Eight on the strength of better run rate, it has also caught Victoria Bushrangers on the wrong foot. The Australians were sitting pretty after their easy win over the DareDevils but now have to win against Wayamba Tuesday in order to make the next round.         
	With top cricketers like Cameron While, Brad Hodge, David Hussey, Clint McKay and Peter Siddle in their ranks, Victoria are definitely the favourites. The Australians ability to quickly adapt to the local conditions is their biggest asset. Against the DareDevils, the Aussies looked awesome and allowed the Delhi team to score only 98 runs. Medium pacer McKay was the pick of the bowlers with three wickets.         
	The local fans expected more from Wayamba but the team put up a disappointing show against the DareDevils.         
	Meanwhile, the Champions League Twenty20 technical committee has Monday confirmed a change to the Bushrangers squad with James Pattinson being replaced by Damien Wright after the 19-year-old suffered a fractured left thumb at training Monday.

                                                   Ex-leggie tipped for top post
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: Former leg-spinner Somachandra de Silva is tipped to be the next chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC).         
	The post has been vacant ever since World Cup-winning captain Arjuna Ranatungas removal in late December.         
	Its almost confirmed that Somachandra will sit in the chair The announcement could be made within 48 hours from now (Friday evening), a top source told The Telegraph from Colombo.         
	The 66-year-old Somachandra, it may be recalled, had been the stand-in captain in two Tests during the 1982-83 tour of New Zealand.         
	That was because of an injury to Duleep Mendis, currently SLCs chief executive.         
	From late December, SLC has been run by the sports ministry-appointed Competent Authority, S.Liyanagama.         
	Liyanagama is Sri Lankas sports secretary and got hand-picked by his minister, Gamini Lokuge.         
	Somachandra, one learns, is very close to Sri Lankas President, Mahinda Rajapakse.         
	Its to be seen whether the new interim committee is also appointed simultaneously.

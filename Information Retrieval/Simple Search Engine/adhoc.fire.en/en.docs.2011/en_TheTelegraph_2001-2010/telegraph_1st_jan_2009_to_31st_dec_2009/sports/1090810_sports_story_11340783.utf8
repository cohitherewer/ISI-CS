	Hyderabad: Saina Nehwal will not set any target, Arvind Bhat wants to take one match at a time while Chetan Anand is brimming with confidence as the Indians look to make a mark in the World Badminton Championships starting at Gachibowli Stadium here Monday.         
	Back in the court after recovering from a mild bout of chicken pox, sixth seed Saina will carry Indias hopes and the 20-year-old has been handed a good draw, getting a bye in the first round.         
	It is a good draw but not at all an easy one because there are quite a few quality players in there and obviously everyone has got a month break to practice and train themselves. So all of them would be fresh and raring to go, Saina said. I would not like to set any target and rather look at one game at a time and give my best that I usually do and see what happens. Preparation has been going on well. I am quite prepared and fit. I just want to go there and give my 100 per cent, she added.                     
	Saina will play her first match in the tournament against the winner of the match between Polish Olga Konon and Russian Anastasia Prokopenko, in the second round.         
	In mens singles, Chetan will spearhead Indias challenge and the 15th seed will open his campaign against Ji Hoon Hong of Korea.         
	If the 29-year-old Indian gets past Ji, Chetan is likely to meet sixth-seed Sony Dwi Kuncoro of Indonesia in the second round.         
	Another prominent Indian in fray in mens singles is World No. 24 Bhat, who has been handed a difficult draw but the current national champion said it wasnt too bad.         
	Wild card entrants, P. Kashyap and Sayali Gokhale lock horns with Irelands Ali Shahhosseini and Jie Yao of the Netherlands in their openers respectively.         
	World No. Aditi Mutatkar will take on 11th seed Juliane Schenk of Germany in the womens singles first round.         
	India will also have high hopes from the doubles pairs  mens, womens and mixed  after their successes in recent tournaments.         
	World No. 8 pair of V. Diju and Jwala Gutta are Indias best bet in the doubles. The pair got a bye in the first round.         
	Similarly, the mens doubles pair of Rupesh Kumar and Sanave Thomas, who won the New Zealand Open Grand Prix and finished runners-up in the Australian Open Grand Prix recently, will meet the 14th seeded Japanese duo Kenichi Hayakawa and Kenta Kazuno in their opener.         
	Even the new womens doubles pair of Aparna Balan and Shruti Kurian have done well in Australia and New Zealand, coming second both the times. The duo got a bye in the first round but will have a difficult job at hand against second seeded Chinese pair of Shu Cheng and Yunlei Zhao in the second round.         
	Meanwhile, Chinese ace Lin Dan is poised to become the first player in World Badminton Championship history to win three successive mens singles titles.         
	Defending champion and Olympic gold medallist Lin, winner of the World Championship in 2006 and 2007, has held an edge over his Malaysian arch-rival Lee Chong Wei in major events and will hope to extend that.         
	His aggressive style, which earned Lin the nickname of Super Dan, was the feature of his triumphs over No.1-ranked Lee in the finals at last years Beijing Olympics and at the All-England Open in Birmingham.         
	Lin will carry that confidence into the upcoming tournament, while Lee will be burdened by the unhappy memory of his last sojourn to Hyderabad, where he made a first-round exit from the Indian Open five months ago, after a bout of food poisoning.         
	Lin and his top-seeded arch-rival Lee are both drawn in the top-half of the championship along with seasoned Danish star and former silver medallist Peter Gade, who is seeded No. 3.         
	In the other half, second-seeded Chinese Jin Chen and former world champion Taufik Hidayat of Indonesia, No. 4 seed this time, have a relatively easier draw. Title holder Lins low No. 5 seeding is because his world ranking dropped due to non-participation in several Super Series events.         
	A potential semi-final encounter between Lin and Lee could be the showpiece of the event, with Lee eager to clinch his maiden World Championship.         
	Before Lins triumphs in the World Championships at Madrid (2006) and Kuala Lumpur (2007), the only player in badminton history to have won successive mens singles titles was his compatriot Yang Yang, but that was before it became an annual event. There was no event in 2008 because it was an Olympic year.         
	In the womens singles, another player chasing a record third title is Chinese player Xingfang Xie. She will get a stiff competition from top seed Mi Zhou.           (AGENCIES)

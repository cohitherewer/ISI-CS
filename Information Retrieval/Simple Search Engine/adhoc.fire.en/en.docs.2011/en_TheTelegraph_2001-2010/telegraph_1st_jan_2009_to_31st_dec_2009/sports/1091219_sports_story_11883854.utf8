The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barca rely on Messi 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Barca rely on Messi 
                      
	Abu Dhabi: Lionel Messis match-winning gene can inspire European champions Barcelona to victory over Estudiantes in the Club World Cup final on Saturday, according to the Spanish sides coach Pep Guardiola.         
	Barcelona are clear favourites to become world club champions at the third attempt and deny Libertadores Cup holders Estudiantes their second title and first since they beat Manchester United in 1968.         
	He carries in his blood a competitive gene, to be the best, Guardiola said after Barcelona came from a goal down to beat Atlante of Mexico in the semi-final with Messi scoring the second goal two minutes after coming on as a substitute.         
	Messi, an injury doubt before the match against the Concacaf champions, is almost certain to start against the Argentine team with midfielder Andres Iniesta ruled out due to a thigh muscle injury.

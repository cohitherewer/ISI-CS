The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Partnering Moya is a great opportunity
                                                                                                                       7                                        Partnering Moya is a great opportunity
            OUR CORRESPONDENT             Yuki Bhambri                           
	Mumbai: Yuki Bhambri is disappointed at not getting a singles wild card for the Chennai Open but is keen to make the most of the opportunity to pair up with former French Open champion Carlos Moya in the doubles.         
	Definitely I am disappointed. I kind of expected it (singles wild card) because I was doing well in the mens circuit, Bhambri told The Telegraph from Delhi.         
	Somdev (Devvarman) is a deserving guy and Moya as well. I thought maybe I will get the third (wild card), the 17-year-old sensation added.         
	Senior Davis Cupper Rohan Bopanna received the third wild card for the season opening ATP Tour mens event, to be held from January 4 to 10. Bhambri, who will have to play the qualifying round to make it to the singles main draw, was excited about partnering Moya in doubles as wild card entrants.         
	It should be exciting. I am going to have fun because its a once in lifetime opportunity to play with a Grand Slam champion, the youngster, who played an exhibition doubles match with Pete Sampras against Andre Agassi last month, said.         
	Bhambri, who returned from the US on Tuesday after a lengthy off-season training, has decided to not defend his Australian Open boys singles crown in Melbourne next month.         
	I wont be playing the Australian Open junior championships. My focus is not on winning junior Grand Slams now. Nothing has been finalised but I want to play more mens tournaments, he said.         
	And the teenager, who skipped the French Open (clay is his least favourite surface) and Wimbledon (due to injury) this year, would be justified as he has already won five Futures titles and has jumped 826 places to 338 in ATP Tour rankings.         
	The down side of it is that he has been toppled as the Worlds No.1 junior singles player and therefore, ironically, his entry into the junior championships at Wimbledon and the US Open this year will depend on his mens ranking.         
	I dont want to be remembered as a player who did well in juniors but not in mens. Hopefully I will go on to play in the mens Wimbledon and do well, Bhambri said.         
	The one thing that had bothered him in an otherwise memorable 2009 was his back injury which he seemed to have aggravated by playing the exhibition match with Sampras in Macau, Mexico.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dempo start favourites
                                                   Dempo start favourites
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Despite their injury woes, defending champions Dempo start favourites against a depleted Air India in their 16th round I-League match at the Cooperage on Friday.         
	Dempo will be missing four key players but the Goan side could take heart from the fact that the hosts have been hit even harder, due to fitness concerns and suspension.         
	Coach Armando Colaco would miss the services of Dominic Noronha, due to double booking, John Charles Dias and Joaquim Abranches because of injuries while overseas signing Mboyo Iyomi, who has been out of action for the past three months, has returned home to Congo.         
	Yet, the visiting coachs worries dwarf in comparison to the problems faced by his counterpart Bimal Ghosh.         
	The home side have to do without captain Udofia Chukwama, who has two yellow cards against his name, while playmaker Emmanuel has to sit out as he was red carded in a 0-1 loss against United SC last week. Besides, Ghosh finds himself at wits end due to the absence of Napoleon Singh, Syed Farid, Vijith Shetty, Narender Meetei and Samson Singh, all of whom are out with injury. Ghosh has the unenviable job of lifting his team from a slump as they have gone winless in their last eight matches and have slipped to eighth place on the league table.         
	Agencies add from Panaji: In the other I-League match of the day, Churchill Brothers will play their hearts out to keep their title hopes alive when they lock horns with bottom-placed Vasco SC in Margao. A defeat against Sporting Clube de Goa has left Churchill six points adrift of table-toppers Mohun Bagan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Victoria goes past Jelena
                                                     Victoria goes past Jelena
                  Jelena Jankovic in action on Tuesday                     
	Doha: Victoria Azarenka marked her debut at the WTA Tour Championships with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Serbias Jelena Jankovic in the tournaments opening match on Tuesday.         
	Jankovic, one of three players to top the world rankings this year but who scraped into the event as the final player among the eight qualifiers last week, sprayed 33 errors on a half-empty show court at the Khalifa Tennis Centre.         
	Members of Qatars ruling Al-Thani family watched from the Royal Box as 20-year-old Belarussian Azarenka sped into a 6-2, 3-1 lead before Jankovic sparked into life to break back.         
	The revival did not last, however, as Azarenka profited from more wayward Jankovic shots and, after coming through an eighth game that went to five deuces, she served out for the victory.         
	Azarenka now tops the White Group that also includes world No. 1 Dinara Safina and Denmarks Caroline Wozniacki.         
	Jankovic admitted her game needed a drastic overhaul.         
	The gritty Serb struggled to keep her groundstrokes inside the lines as she handed 20-year-old Azarenka a surprisingly easy victory.         
	I basically gave her everything. I beat myself. That was really unfortunately the case. My game was completely off, said the 24-year-old.         
	 I would hit one or two balls and then the third one would go everywhere except in the court. I was a shadow of myself.         
	Jankovic will have to improve drastically in her remaining White Group matches, starting with Safina on Wednesday, if she is to match her performance last year here when she reached the semi-finals.         
	However, she hinted that there might not be a quick fix for the problems that have afflicted her game for most of the year, admitting that pretty much everything needed fixing.         
	I just have to try to clean my game, she said. I need to get back to playing good points, hitting the ball, being aggressive, really cutting down all the errors, serve much better, return much better.         
	I kept pushing myself to play better and I wanted to play better, but I just couldnt get into the match. I just hope that tomorrow I can play better.         
	I will have to do a lot of work in the off-season to get back to my level and get to the top. Thats all I know. There is really a lot of work to be done.         
	I know that I have to make some changes and I have to improve my game because what you have seen today, really I gave the match away.         
	Azarenka was more than happy to profit from Jankovics woes, firing back at the Serbs opinion that she had been gifted a victory. Im glad she gave me the match and she was not in the mood. It worked out pretty well for me, she said.         
	The Belarussian will face fellow debutant and close friend Caroline Wozniacki on Wednesday when another victory could all but seal her place in the semi-finals. I expect a good match from her, she said Shes a great fighter, a good girl, and Im sure were going to have fun.

	Mumbai: Coach-less, Bhaichung-less, Rennedy-less. Thankfully, one item that East Bengal have managed to strike off from that list, ahead of their I-League clash against Air India on Saturday, is win-less.         
	Having registered their first victory of the season, never mind it came against basement side Viva Kerala, and thus recovering from the demoralising loss to archrivals Mohun Bagan, East Bengal will be keen to log more points at the Cooperage.         
	It will be a clash of two teams struggling to produce results this season. East Bengal have been afflicted by off-field controversies whereas Air India have a more tangible matter to worry about, leaky defence.         
	And both will be missing key players due to injury. Bhaichung Bhutia and Rennedy Singh are still in rehabilitation while Mehtab Hussain is out suspended for the Calcutta club.         
	The hosts, on the other hand, will be without the services of Dada Nabeel, Tapan Maity and N.D. Opara, the Nigerian out with a double booking against his name.         
	Belgian Philippe de Ridder, who has been appointed Subhas Bhowmicks replacement, will be watching from the sidelines as he was to arrive only on Friday night, but East Bengal will take heart from their 1-1 draw against Salgaocar.         
	They also overcame Viva Kerala 1-0 without a guiding hand in the dug-out since the 5-3 loss to Bagan a fortnight ago.

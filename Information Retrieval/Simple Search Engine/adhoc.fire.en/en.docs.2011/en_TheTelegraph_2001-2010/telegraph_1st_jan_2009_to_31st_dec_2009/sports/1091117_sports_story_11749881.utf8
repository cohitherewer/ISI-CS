The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB plans corporate boxes
                                                                                                                                   CAB plans corporate boxes
            A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) is planning to have at least 35-40 corporate boxes in the upper tier of Eden Gardens B, C, K, L blocks. The four said blocks have been dismantled and the lower tiers will have bucket seats. The CAB brass is optimistic that having proper corporate boxes will help them generate a healthy revenue in near future.         
	We are planning to have corporate boxes like the ones we saw at Wanderers in Johannesburg and Supersport Park in Centurion. The corporate boxes will have a proper balcony from where the owners and their guests can enjoy the match. There is plan to have a separate lounge as well as dining arena. The food and beverages will be served by the best in the hospitality business (save liquor as state government wont give permission), a senior CAB official informed.         
	The CAB is also planning to invite the interested corporates for detailed discussions in January.         
	The first time we had those small corporate boxes was during the Reliance Cup in 1987 and we sold them for Rs 15 lakh per box. We are planning to do a market survey but roughly we have decided to sell those boxes for around Rs 40 lakh on a lease of 20 years.         
	However, the ICC tournaments and IPL are excluded from the list of international matches. During any BCCI organised ODI, Test series or T20 International matches, the owners can enjoy each and every facility, he added.

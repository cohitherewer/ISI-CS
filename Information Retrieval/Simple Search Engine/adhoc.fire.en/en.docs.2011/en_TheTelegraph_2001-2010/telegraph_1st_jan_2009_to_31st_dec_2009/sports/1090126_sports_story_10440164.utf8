                                                   AIBA chief lauds Indian pugilists
                      
	New Delhi: Indian pugilists were the surprise package of the year gone by, says International Boxing Association (AIBA) president Ching-Kuo Wu who foresees them giving Cuba and Russia a serious run for their money in the lighter weight divisions.         
	I believe India obviously proved to all parties that they were the surprise package of the year and this bodes well, not only for Indian boxing but international boxing all round, Wu said from AIBA headquarters in Lausanne. The AIBA chief took the occasion to laud the likes of Vijender Singh (75kg) and Akhil Kumar (54kg) and Jitender Kumar (51kg) and M.C. Mary Kom.

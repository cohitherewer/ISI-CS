                                                   Goal 2011 wont help: Barreto
            A STAFF REPORTER                                  Baretto      
	Calcutta: Jose Ramirez Barreto feels the All India Football Federations (AIFF) Goal 2011 project will not help in improving the standard of the game in the country.         
	I dont think it is the right move Having a vision of only two-three years wont help. Youve got to start dreaming big and aim long term, say for a minimum of six to seven years, Barreto told The Telegraph on Wednesday.         
	The AIFF is planning to select 25 players from various clubs who would be earmarked only for national duty till the Doha Asia Cup in January 2011.         
	The Brazilian thinks spending Rs 40 crore behind the project would be a waste.         
	Spending Rs 40 crore like that wont help Spending that money at the junior level would be more beneficial. It will only make club football poorer Remember clubs form the base of the countrys football. You cant progress that way. Have a proper vision spread over six to seven years he explained.         
	The Mohun Bagan star, who was present at the inauguration of the All India Major Ports football tournament at the Salt Lake Stadium, felt they still had a chance in the I-League and the consecutive losses in the AFC Cup will have no effect.         
	Mohun Bagan next play United SC on Monday in the I-League. We are still there You cannot rule us out. The next match is vital and we have to win. Winning is important and only then can we stay in contention, he said.         
	Barreto, who has been out of action since picking up a back injury against Churchill Brothers in Goa, said he hoped to return to action against United SC.

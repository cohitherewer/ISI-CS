                                                   Support staff cry foul over false promise
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: An unsavoury controversy has cropped up over the payment of bonus to the support staff of the national team that won the Nehru Cup here in August.         
	While it was widely reported all members of the squad including the support staff would be paid Rs 2 lakh each by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) for their commendable performance, only the players have received the promised amount.         
	The AIFF has not kept its promise, alleged a member of the support staff, who did not wish to be named. We have been given only Rs 1 lakh each, exactly half of what the players have been given.         
	Another team official endorsed the view. Minutes after the final, the AIFF acting president, Praful Patel announced everyone in the team including the support staff would be awarded a bonus of Rs 2 lakh each.         
	I was shocked when I was given a cheque of Rs 1 lakh. Does that mean the announcement was made only to derive publicity, the official asked. I dont know what exactly AIFF got by denying us of our money.The AIFF general secretary, Alberto Colaco said he was not aware of any such promise.         
	As far as I know only the players were to be given Rs 2 lakh each and that has already been given to them. The other team officials are paid staff. They cannot be equated with the players. The AIFF has given them Rs 1 lakh each. That is also a good amount.         
	Colaco, however, said if any such promise was actually made, he would see the money be paid to the support staff.         
	The AIFF has no intention to deprive anyone of his rightful claims, he added.

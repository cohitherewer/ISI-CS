                                                   Sania moves ahead
                      
	Melbourne: Sania Mirza survived a late onslaught from world No. 61 Marta Domachowhska to set up a second-round clash with Russian 10th seed Nadia Petrova in the womens singles of the Australian Open, here Monday.         
	The unseeded Indian battled past the Pole 6-1, 6-4 in the first round.         
	Nadia beat Yaroslava Shvedova of Kazakhstan 6-3, 7-6(7-3) in her opening round match.         
	Sania, playing her first singles match of the season after a long injury-lay off, was happy with her comeback match.         
	It was a great way to begin.         
	Ive not played a big match in almost six months now. Im just happy to have come through, she said after the match.         
	Sania raced away with the first set in just 25 minutes, breaking the Polish player thrice.         
	The Indian led 2-0 in the second set before Marta stepped on the gas, winning four games on the trot, breaking Sania in the third and fifth games.         
	From a comfortable 2-0, Sania found herself trailing 2-4 in no time.         
	Under pressure, the 22-year-old Hyderabad girl got her act together and went on to win the next four games to seal the issue, breaking Marta in the eighth and 10th games in the process.         
	Sania had lost to Marta in 2003 in their first meeting and now the head-to-head record stands at 1-1.           (PTI)

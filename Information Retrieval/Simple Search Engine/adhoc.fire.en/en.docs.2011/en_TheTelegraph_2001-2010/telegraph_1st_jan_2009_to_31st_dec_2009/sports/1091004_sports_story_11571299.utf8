The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vettel on pole 
                                                     Vettel on pole 
                  Timo Glock was injured in a crash                     
	Suzuka: Formula One championship contenders Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello were among five drivers penalised five starting places in a chaotic day of qualifying Saturday for the Japanese Grand Prix.         
	The Brawn GP pair, Renaults Fernando Alonso and Force Indias Adrian Sutil failed to slow when yellow flags were waved during the second session of qualifying. Toro Rossos Sebastian Buemi, whose accident brought out the flags, also drops back five spots.         
	Button and Barrichello, who had qualified in seventh and fifth places respectively, will now be at a major disadvantage to Red Bulls Sebastian Vettel, who still retains slim championship hopes and starts from pole position alongside Toyotas Italian Jarno Trulli.         
	Button, who needs to finish at least fourth if the title race is not to go on to Brazil in two weeks time, will now start 11th on the provisional grid with Barrichello 9th. Button can only win the championship on Sunday, with two races to spare, if he scores five points more than Brazilian Barrichello.         
	Britains outgoing world champion Lewis Hamilton will line up third with BMW-Saubers Nick Heidfeld alongside after Force Indias Adrian Sutil was dropped five places from fourth. Sutil provisionally starts eighth on the grid after his five-place penalty. Force Indias other driver, Vitantonio Liuzzi too incurred a five-place grid penalty for changing his gearbox and starts eighteenth.         
	The final grid positions could change further however, with Toyotas Timo Glock doubtful after crashing heavily and being taken to hospital.         
	A spokeswoman for FIA said the official grid would not be published before Sunday.           (REUTERS)

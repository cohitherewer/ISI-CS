                                                   Fitness is no worry: McGrath
                      
	New Delhi: Former Australia pacer Glenn McGrath may not have played competitive cricket since last years Indian Premier League (IPL) but feels that would not be an issue when he puts on his boots for the tournaments second season which kicks off in South Africa on April 18.         
	McGrath, who plays for the Delhi DareDevils, has been largely busy bringing up his three children, following wife Janes death. He also has to take care of the charity organisation founded by his wife but will put everything to the back burner for five gruelling weeks of IPL action.         
	The 39-year old McGrath, who emerged the most economical (6.61) of Delhi Daredevils bowlers, claims his competitive edge is still intact.         
	I struggled a bit last year, but that was more about Jane and how the situation was back home, McGrath said. That wont be a concern this time. Mum may bring the kids over for the middle period, depending on the schedule. My whole focus will be a lot different when Im there, which I think will all be positive. Last time I think I did reasonably well considering I hadnt played for 12 months. I have no doubts it will be similar this time, but my mindset will be different, he told a cricket website.         
	The Australian legend admitted he could not say no to the IPL with the amount of money on offer.         
	There is a lot of incentive going over there with the money theyre offering, he said. McGrath will be in Delhi this week for the DelhiDaredevils week-long training camp before leaving for South Africa on April 7.

                                                   Symonds fine after surgery
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Australian allrounder Andrew Symonds underwent a successful arthroscopic knee surgery on Wednesday.         
	According to information forwarded by Cricket Australia (CA), Symonds, who is ruled out of the third Test at the SCG starting Saturday, will also miss the Twenty20 Internationals against South Africa on January 11 and 13.         
	CA however, is hopeful of his return at some point during the five-match one-day series against the Proteas starting from January 16.         
	CA doctor, Trefor James, said: Although there were some minor signs of wearing, the main problem was loose fragments of cartilage that were jamming in the joint, which were removed. We will monitor Andrews progress in the coming weeks, but are hopeful he will become available for selection at some point. during the Commonwealth Bank Series against South Africa or New Zealand.         
	It was learnt that the allrounder developed the pain on his knee during the first Test at the WACA.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Intikhab: Malik had no leadership qualities
                                                     Intikhab: Malik had no leadership qualities
                  Malik                     
	Karachi: Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam had described former skipper Shoaib Malik as an aloof and loner in his report, which eventually resulted in his sacking from the helm of the cricket team.         
	Intikhab submitted the report after the humiliating ODI series defeat against Sri Lanka, in which he described Malik as a failed leader incapable of infusing team spirit among the players.         
	[The Telegraph had reported on January 29 that coach Intikhabs scathing report after the ODI series against Sri Lanka prompted the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to ask Malik to step down as captain or be sacked.]         
	We have found him incapable of being a leader. He is aloof and a loner and hardly spends any time with the players, Alam said in the report which was read out on Monday at the hearing of the senate standing committee on sports in Islamabad.         
	Alam also said that the senior players didnt have enough confidence in Malik and the team was unable to gel under his leadership.         
	The report also recommended that the selectors should play legspinner Danish Kaneria in both Tests and one-dayers.         
	The PCB officials came under fire at the hearing with a senator demanding the resignation of beleaguered PCB chairman Ejaz Butt.         
	According to sources, Butt and chief operating officer Saleem Altaf faced a lot of criticism from the committee during the near six hour session. (PTI)

                                                   Bhullar ahead
                      
	Gurgaon: Gaganjeet Bhullar brought home his second successive round of four-under 68 to grab the lead in the DLF Masters golf tournament here on Friday.         
	Digvijay Singh (137) matched Bhullars effort to grab the second spot from one shot behind, while Jyoti Randhawa, Shamim Khan, Ashok Kumar and Rahil Gangjee went into the third place huddle at five-under 139.         
	The cut was declared at 149 and 54 professionals made the cut.         
	Bhullars trademark 350-yard drive on his opening hole  10th  gave a glimpse of the kind of form he has been in over the last few weeks. He rallied to collect birdies on the 14th, 16th and 18th to put things in order.         
	Bhullar bogeyed the first and second thanks to a couple of missed chip-putts. A chip-in and some accurate approach shots earned him four more birdies on the fifth, sixth, seventh and ninth to push him into the lead.         
	I holed some good putts today. Missing a one foot putt for birdie on the 15th was a bit disappointing. However, I was pleased with my effort on the 18th, Bhullar said.           (PTI)

	Calcutta: India start overwhelming favourites in the 4th Asian Grand Prix which begins Thursday at the SAI, Eastern Complex in Salt Lake.         
	Besides hosts India the other participants are Bangladesh, Bhutan, Hong Kong, Iran, Nepal, Singapore, Northern Ireland and Scotland.         
	Dola Bannerjee, Jayanta Talukdar, Rahul Bannerjee and Mangal Singh Champia will lead the Indian charge.         
	This meet can be a good preparation for us ahead of the Asian Archery Championship and the Commonwealth Games. With the field not too strong, we definitely have a good chance here, said Dola.         
	For Jayanta, who has qualified for the final leg of World Cup, the meet will serve to provide match practice and he would like to get into the groove before leaving for Denmark.

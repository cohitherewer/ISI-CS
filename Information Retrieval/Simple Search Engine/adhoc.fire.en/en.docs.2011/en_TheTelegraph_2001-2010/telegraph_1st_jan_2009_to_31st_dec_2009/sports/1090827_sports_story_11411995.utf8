The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Andy gives vent to Wada ire
                                                   Andy gives vent to Wada ire

	Andy Murray used micro-blogging site Twitter to reveal his anger at drug-testers who woke the world No. 2 on a rare day-off from the tennis courts.         
	World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) officials saw the matter slightly differently and demanded an immediate urine sample from the Scot, who was sleeping at the time in his New York hotel.         
	Murray later wrote on Twitter: First day off in a while so you can imagine I was very pleased to get woken up by drug-testers at 7.15. Cant imagine a more relaxing way to start the day than having someone watching you go to the toilet.         
	The Scot goes into the final Grand Slam event of the year as the world No. 2 and brimming with confidence, the reward for a summers work which saw him win the Masters Series title in Montreal and reach the semi-finals in Cincinnati.         
	In February Murray criticised the ATP drug-testing system after undergoing his third test in just over two weeks. The Scot who had to wait for 90 minutes to produce the specimen  claimed there was one system for the top players and another for the journeymen and said that had to change.         
	Spains Rafael Nadal has also had plenty to say on the subject.         
	He said: I think it shows a lack of respect for privacy. I think its a disgrace. These are things that completely have to change, and there is a unanimous voice on that in the locker room. It is an intolerable hunt.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

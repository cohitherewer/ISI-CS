	New Delhi: India skipper Bhaichung Bhutia on Wednesday was re-elected president of the Football Players Association of India (FPAI).         
	The association, which is set to launch its website shortly, has also elected three vice presidents in former India captain, S Venkatesh, seasoned defender Mahesh Gawli and striker Abhishek Yadav.         
	Sunil Chetri has been elected the assistant general secretary of the association, which has been trying in vain for the past three years to get the official recognition from the All India Football Federation (AIFF).

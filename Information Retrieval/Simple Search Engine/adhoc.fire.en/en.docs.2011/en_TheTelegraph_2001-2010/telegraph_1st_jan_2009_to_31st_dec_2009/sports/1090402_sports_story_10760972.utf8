	Bangkok: Australia had one foot in next years World Cup finals after beating Uzbekistan 2-0 on Wednesday while South Korea scored a late winner to down rivals North Korea 1-0 and wrestle back the Group Two lead.         
	Victory gave Australia 13 points from five games in Group One, two clear of Japan, but Bahrains 1-0 triumph over Qatar prevented the Socceroos becoming the first team to qualify for the tournament in South Africa.         
	Two teams progress from each Asian section and the third-placed sides contest a two-legged playoff for the right to meet Oceania champions New Zealand for a place in the World Cup finals.         
	South Korea snatched the group lead from their fierce political foes after a free kick wide on the right from Kim Chi-woo with three minutes left floated past a hoard of players into the far corner of the net.         
	The win put the 2002 World Cup semi-finalists top on 11 points, with North Korea one point behind having played one more game.         
	After a dour first half in Sydney, Australia took the lead in the 66th minute with a header from the unmarked Josh Kennedy. Harry Kewell then made it 2-0 with a 73rd-minute penalty.         
	There was a lot of pressure because we knew we had to win.         
	It was a rusty first half, but second half, the boys put a lot of pressure on and we got what we deserved., Australia captain Lucas Neill said in a television interview.         
	Kennedy, a tall forward with German club Karlsruhe, broke the deadlock in the 66th minute, six minutes after coming on to replace Celtic striker Scott McDonald. The 26-year-old Kennedy directed a header inside the near post from Mark Brescianos powerful cross from the right edge of the area. It was his sixth goal in 12 matches for Australia.         
	Ex-Liverpool winger Kewell drove a left-foot penalty kick low and hard into the bottom right corner of the net to seal the win in the 73rd after Hull City midfielder Richard Garcia was felled in a rough challenge inside the area.         
	About time I did something! the Galatasary forward joked. Kewells powerful left-foot volley from close range earlier in the half rebounded off the back of a defender.         
	It was all about the result tonight. We worked hard together and we got the result we needed, Kewell said.         
	Were not fully there yet. Were 70 percent there. Weve got three games left. Were going to look to win all of them. It was a great header by Josh to get us going, he added.         
	The first half, 50 minutes, they were very dangerous. They made us a little scared, Australia coach Pim Verbeek said.         
	We were a little afraid to go forward. We said at half time, look, you cant do this. You have go forward, faster. put pressure on them. It worked. Im very proud.         
	Australia must wait until their visit to Qatar on June 6 to get the point they need to advance.         
	Fouzi Aaishs free kick on 52 minutes gave Bahrain a 1-0 win in Manama and condemned Qatar to their fourth defeat in a row.         
	Bahrain are third on seven points, with Qatar and Uzbekistan equal bottom on four apiece.         
	South Korea found it tough against their defensively solid neighbours and stepped up a gear after an entertaining but scoreless first half.         
	They almost fell behind soon after the break when Jong Tae-ses header, which appeared to cross the line, was clawed away by keeper Lee Woon-jae.         
	South Koreas frustrations were compounded when they squandered a series of scoring opportunities, Lee Keun-ho twice the guilty party.         
	Park Chu-youngs 66th-minute blocked shot landed at Lees feet but he tamely struck the ball into the hands of the goalkeeper.         
	Lee then did exactly the same thing two minutes later to the despair of the packed crowd.         
	I expected it would be a one-goal margin, said South Korea coach Huh Jung-moo. I felt the Norths team were getting better and better and they will be an even better team (in the future).

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mahindra United survived a scare, thanks to Mohammed Rafis second-half header in a 1-1 I-League draw against Viva Kerala at the Cooperage here on Friday.         
	The Cochin-based outfit, placed second from bottom in the standings, seemed set to cause a major upset when they took the lead in the 27th minute through Wisoot Bunpeng who slotted home from a set-piece.         
	The hosts, who were listless in the first half, scored the equaliser in the 53rd minute when Rafi headed in a precise free-kick by N.P. Pradeep.         
	The fourth successive draw saw United stay third with 11 points while Viva too stayed put, at 13th with four points.

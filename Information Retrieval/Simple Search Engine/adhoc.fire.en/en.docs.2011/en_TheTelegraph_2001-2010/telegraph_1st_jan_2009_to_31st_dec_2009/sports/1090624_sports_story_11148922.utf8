The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis resolve set in stone 
                                                     Younis resolve set in stone 
  - I had decided before going to the World T20 I would retire no matter what the result             Younis Khan upon his arrival in Karachi on Tuesday. (AP)                           
	Karachi: Pakistan captain Younis Khan on Tuesday made it clear that he will not go back on his decision to retire from Twenty20 cricket despite the growing pressure on him.         
	I had decided before going to the World T20 I would retire no matter what the result. I dont want to be in a situation where I am left out of the team, Younis, who was mobbed by fans at the Karachi airport, said.         
	I think now T20 cricket is a very tough form of the game. It saps your energy in 40 overs. It is not easy cricket. I am too old for this type of cricket, he said.         
	Younis said a relaxed approach was the reason behind his teams World Cup victory.         
	I became a more serious captain after the early losses. I realised I had to be serious. I am happy that we could bring so much joy to the people, he said.         
	Our strategy was simple. I decided to take the pressure and allow the others to play freely. We gave a free licence to Kamran (Akmal) and Shahid (Afridi) and it was decided that if they failed I would go into bat and take the pressure.         
	Pakistan beat Sri Lanka in the final at Lords on Sunday. Younis said he was happy to see youngsters like Mohammed Aamer, Shahzaid Hasan, Fawad Alam and Ahmed Shehzad doing well.         
	I feel good that the future of Pakistan cricket is in good hands. I think these youngsters must get more chances in T20 cricket, Younis said.         
	I had a feeling we could go all the way because the body language of the players changed and I knew no one could stop us now from winning the tournament, he added.         
	Younis said he was happy and proud at winning the World Cup for his countrymen.         
	It is satisfying to know you have brought so much joy to your people. They needed something to smile about in these hard times when there is so much problem, he said.         
	The Pakistan captain was surprised at the statement of former chief selector Abdul Qadir that he would not have picked Younis or Shoaib Malik in his T20 team.         
	Qadir gave the statement while resigning from his post during the tournament. Younis said he didnt know what was on Qadirs mind.         
	It is his own opinion but his resignation and statement were bad timing. It had no effect on me but it did affect Malik who came to me and complained.         
	Younis said Qadirs statement just spurred him on to do better. I am always motivated by challenges and I perform better under pressure, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Pakistan Cricket Board director general Javed Miandad urged Younis Khan to reconsider his decision of retiring from Twenty20 cricket, saying his presence was important to defend the World T20 title next year and win the 2011 ODI World Cup.         
	The next T20 World Cup is just a year away and then we have the main World Cup in early 2011 so it would be better if Younis remained captain in all forms of the game, he said.         
	Younis must continue to play and captain the team in all forms of the game to maintain consistency and uniformity in the team for future tournaments, the former captain said.

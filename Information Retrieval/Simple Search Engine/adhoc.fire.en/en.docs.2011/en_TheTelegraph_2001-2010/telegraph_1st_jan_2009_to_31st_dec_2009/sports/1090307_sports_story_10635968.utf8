                  Somdev Dev Varman in action against Ti Chen                     
	Kaohsiung (Chinese Taipei): Somdev Dev Varman recorded his first Davis Cup win to keep India afloat in the second round tie against Chinese Taipei as both teams were locked 1-1 on the opening day of the Asia/Oceania Zone group I tie here Friday.         
	Somdev overcame a fighting but erratic Ti Chen 7-5, 6-4, 6-4 in the first singles to put India ahead, only for Yen-Hsun Lu to bring the hosts back into the tie with his 7-6(7-2), 6-2, 6-2 defeat of Rohan Bopanna in the second singles.         
	Now Saturdays doubles rubber could prove decisive as whoever wins would have an advantage on Sunday when players take court for the reverse singles.         
	India can count on their seasoned doubles pair  Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi  for a favourable result, as they take on the pairing of Tsung-Hua Yang and Chu-Huan Yi at the Yang Ming tennis centre.         
	India and Chinese Taipei are playing for the first time in the tournament.         
	Somdevs victory gave India a 1-0 lead and the Indian camp was looking to Bopanna to make it 2-0, but Lu poured cold water on Indian hopes in a rain-disrupted match.         
	The first set turned out to be an intense affair between two players who had come into the tie with some good results in the current season.         
	Lu has beaten the likes of former world No.1 Lleyton Hewitt and David Nalbandian, and Bopanna has, along with partner Jarrko Nieminen, beaten the doubles world No.1 pairing of Bob and Mike Bryan.         
	Both the players relied on their strong serve, forcing the first set into a tie-breaker after it went with serve till the 12th game. Bopanna had four breakpoints in the seventh game but Lu saved all of them brilliantly.           (PTI )

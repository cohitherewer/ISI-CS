The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spurs stare at exit
                                                   Spurs stare at exit
                      
	London: Ukraines Shakhtar Donetsk left twice UEFA Cup winners Tottenham Hotspur staring at an exit from the competition after netting late goals for a 2-0 victory in their first knock out round first leg tie on Thursday.         
	Shakhtar, playing their first competitive match since early December, ended stubborn resistance from a makeshift Spurs side in the final 12 minutes at a freezing Olympiyskiy Stadium.         
	A gaffe from Tottenhams goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes handed Shakhtar the lead after 78 minutes with substitute Yevgen Seleznov scoring just seconds after coming on.         
	Jadson swung a freekick into the box and fellow Brazilian Gomes was beaten to the ball by Seleznov, who headed in.         
	Shakhtar left Spurs with an uphill battle for next weeks return at White Hart Lane by adding a second goal two minutes from time. Jadson cut in from the right and played a one-two before creating space for a shot that comfortably beat Gomes.

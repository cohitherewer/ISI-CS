	Paris: Holders Barcelona can secure a place in the Champions League knock-out stage even if they lose at Dynamo Kiev on Wednesday, but Inter Milan face a winner-takes-all home encounter with Rubin Kazan.         
	All four teams in Group F will go into their final group games with hopes of going through, but it is pool leaders Barcelona who hold the strongest hand.         
	Pep Guardiolas side have slipped into top gear in recent weeks, defeating Inter 2-0 in their last Champions League assignment and edging domestic rivals Real Madrid in the first Clasico of the season.         
	This is the biggest game of our season so far and it will define the rest of our season, said Guardiola after his sides 3-1 win at Deportivo la Coruna on Saturday evening. Im confident that we will preform well. We cannot go out of Europe and we have to finish top of our group, he added.         
	Barca can afford to lose by any two-goal scoreline other than 2-0 in Kiev, due to their 2-0 victory over the Ukrainians in the reverse fixture, while a 0-0 or 1-1 draw will be enough for Inter at home to freshly crowned Russian champions Kazan as long as Dynamo do not win.         
	Inters lead at the top of Serie A was cut to four points when they lost 2-1 at Juventus on Saturday but they will be bolstered by the return to fitness of Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder.         
	We are disappointed because we wanted to win the big game against Juventus, said Inters Brazilian international goalkeeper Julio Cesar.         
	Liverpools catastrophic exit from the competition made the headlines in Group E, with Fiorentina travelling to Anfield on Wednesday knowing that victory will secure top spot in the group ahead of Lyon.         
	With Liverpool already assured of a place in the Europa League, coach Rafael Benitez is likely to use the visit of the Viola to test the fitness of Fernando Torres and hand a first start to Italian summer signing Alberto Aquilani.         
	Should Fiorentina fail to beat Liverpool, Lyon must win by two goals at home to the groups bottom side Debrecen to snatch top spot and secure a potentially favourable draw in the last 16.         
	Dutch champions AZ Alkmaar, who sacked coach Ronald Koeman at the weekend, cannot make the next round but will take the Europa League qualifying spot with victory at Standard Liege.

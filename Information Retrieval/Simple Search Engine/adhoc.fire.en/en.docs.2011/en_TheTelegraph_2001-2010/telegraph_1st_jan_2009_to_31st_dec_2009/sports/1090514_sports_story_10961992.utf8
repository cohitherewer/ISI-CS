The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The Royals start as underdogs
                                                   The Royals start as underdogs
                      
	Durban: Rajasthan Royals will be a lesser force when they take on the in-form Mumbai Indians in a crucial Indian Premier League match here Thursday, with their inspirational captain Shane Warne ruled out owing to a hamstring injury.         
	Warnes hamstring injury means his much-anticipated face-off with Mumbai captain Sachin Tendulkar, which was denied by the rain Gods last time around, will have to wait.         
	Both the teams are tied on 11 points after 11 games but Mumbai are ahead on net run rate at the fourth spot and Thursdays match might prove to be crucial in deciding the semi-finalists.         
	The Royals current form is not too encouraging and after the team lost to the Chennai Super Kings and the Deccan Chargers in their last two matches, Warnes imposing presence would surely be missed.         
	The Mumbai side, on the other hand, seem to have recovered from a hat-trick of losses and have registered back-to-back wins over the Royal Challengers Bangalore and the Kings XI Punjab to put their campaign back on track.         
	The teams batting looks solid with Tendulkar in reasonable form and J.P. Duminy emerging as the middle order mainstay. Among others, Dwayne Bravo has also been among the runs while Ajinkya Rahane played well in his first appearance.         
	Sanath Jayasuriyas form, however, remains a concern and Tendulkar would expect the Sri Lankan to come out of the bad patch Thursday and play his natural, swashbuckling cricket. Mumbai bowlers are not doing too badly either and injured pace spearhead Zaheer Khans absence has not been felt much.         
	Lasith Malinga and Harbhajan Singh have combined to lead the attack well, although the fiery off-spinner has complained that he is not aware of his role in the team.         
	In comparison, the Royals batting is too dependant on Graeme Smith and Yusuf Pathan.         
	The unavailability of pacers Kamran Khan and Amit Singh, both of whom were found guilty of having a suspect action, has taken the bite out of the Royals bowling attack. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Atletico, Villarreal slump to defeats
                                                   Atletico, Villarreal slump to defeats
                      
	Madrid: Villarreal and Atletico Madrid continued to struggle in La Liga after both slumped to unexpected defeats on Sunday.         
	Promoted Xerez came from behind to beat Villarreal 2-1 and notch up their first ever La Liga victory, sending the visitors to the foot of the standings. Atletico were torn apart 3-0 by Osasuna, conceding all three goals inside the first half hour in Pamplona.         
	Xerez, who had scored one goal and collected just two points from their first six matches in the Spanish top flight, fell behind to a 17th-minute goal from Robert Pires.         
	But Villarreal, who were also seeking their first win under new coach Ernesto Valverde this season, were full of nerves and were pegged back to 1-1 when Mario Bermejo headed in at a corner before the break. Xerez climbed to 18th with five points, one ahead of Malaga, who lost 2-1 to Almeria, and Villarreal who have three.         
	Leaders Barcelona top the standings with 19 points despite being held to a 0-0 draw in Valencia on Saturday.           (REUTERS)

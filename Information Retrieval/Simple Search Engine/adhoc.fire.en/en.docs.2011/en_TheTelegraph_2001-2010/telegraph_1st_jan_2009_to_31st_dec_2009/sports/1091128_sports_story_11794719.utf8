	Silverstone: Force India will retain Adrian Sutil and Vitantonio Liuzzi as its drivers for the 2010 Formula One season.         
	We are very pleased to retain the services of both Adrian and Tonio for another season, team owner Vijay Mallya said Friday. Consistency is key at this stage in the teams development and for the first time in many years we will have the continuity of not only the same drivers, but also the same engine and senior management.         
	With this stability now in place I truly believe we have an excellent platform to build on and move forward on our strong 2009 performance.         
	Force India finished ninth out of 10 teams with 13 points in the constructors championship.         
	After three seasons in F1, the 26-year-old Sutil recorded his best finish in 2009: fourth at the Italian Grand Prix.         
	I want to be in the points on a regular basis, maybe even challenging for the podium, the German said.         
	Liuzzi retains his seat after being promoted from his role as test and reserve driver in September for the remaining five races.         
	It was always my goal to be back racing in 2010 and Ive finally achieved it, the 28-year-old Italian said. I feel the five races I did in 2009 were a bit of a warmup  get back racing, learn the car, get the feeling back. Now Ive done that I feel ready to really push next season.         
	A decision on the third driver will be made after Paul di Resta of Britain and J.R. Hildebrand of the United States complete their tests next month in Jerez, Spain.           (PTI)

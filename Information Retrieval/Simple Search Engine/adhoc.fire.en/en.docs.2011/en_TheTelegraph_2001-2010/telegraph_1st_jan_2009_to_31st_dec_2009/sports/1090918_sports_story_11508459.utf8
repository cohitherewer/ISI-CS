                                                   Adventure behind decision
                      
	London: Greed was not behind Andrew Flintoffs snub to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) contract but it his ambition to try adventure sport that led to the decision, according to his agent.         
	According to Flintoffs agent, the burly all-rounder is likely to appear in an adventure show on TV where he may go for bungee-jumping and the national contract with cricket Board does not permit that.         
	Ive seen reports hes a mercenary  hes nothing of the sort. There were one or two things in it that made it difficult to sign. Like he wouldnt be allowed to participate in dangerous sports and hes possibly doing a television series in which he may do bungee-jumping, Andrew Chandler said.

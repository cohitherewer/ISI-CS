                                                     Bhaichung sends letter to Bagan
            A STAFF REPORTER            Bhaichung Bhutia                                   
	Calcutta: India captain Bhaichung Bhutia on Thursday sent a letter to the Mohun Bagan club, the contents of which couldnt be confirmed.         
	While the club claimed that the letter was a reply to the show cause notice slapped on Bhaichung last week  for allegedly neglecting club duties  the letter could also be the footballers request for an early release from the club.         
	A top Mohun Bagan official confirmed receiving the letter. We dont know about the content Its a sealed enveloped addressed to the secretary. The secretary is on a holiday and we will hand it over to him when he returns. We are not in a hurry to decide anything. Bhaichung has taken a long time to answer and now we will take our sweet time.         
	Club secretary Anjan Mitra, when contacted, said: Yes, I have heard that he (Bhaichung) has sent a letter to the club. But I cannot say anything without checking what he has actually said.         
	According to Mitra, he would place the letter in front of the working committee before deciding the next move.         
	East Bengal authorities declined to comment anything on the issue. Meanwhile, former India coach Syed Nayeemuddin has held Bhaichung responsible for the tiff with Bagan. The veteran coach, who was at the Mohun Bagan ground to watch a practice match between the Bengal Santosh Trophy squad and Services, said: I think this problem could have been avoided easily if he (Bhaichung) had said sorry to the club authorities.

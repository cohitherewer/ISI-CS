	Paris: Serena Williams raced into the French Open third round on Thursday with a clinical 6-2, 6-0 demolition of Spaniard Virginia Ruano Pascual.         
	Two days after blasting her first-round performance as junior tennis when she needed nine match points and three sets to end the challenge of Czech Klara Zakopalova, Williams turned on the style to demolish her opponent in 57 minutes.         
	The 10-times Grand Slam champion and second seed needed two match points to secure victory after the world No. 133 pulled out a beautiful passing shot that even Williams watched in admiration on the first.         
	The American sealed the match when her powerful crosscourt backhand could only be smacked wide by her opponent. Williams will face another Spaniard, Maria Jose Martinez-Sanchez, in the next round.         
	Roger Federer survived a tough match on his least favourite surface on Thursday, overturning a 5-1 deficit in the third set to beat Jose Acasuso of Argentina 7-6(10-8), 5-7, 7-6(7-2), 6-2 in the second round of the French Open.         
	Venus Williams also came close to an early exit, needing to save a match point before beating Lucie Safarova of the Czech Republic 6-7(5-7), 6-2, 7-5. Fifth seed Jelena Jankovic joined the seven-time Grand Slam champion in the third round of the womens tournament by defeating Magdalena Rybarikova of Slovakia 6-1, 6-2.         
	Williams began her match on Wednesday, but play was suspended because of darkness after the third seed American lost the first set. She faced a match point while trailing 5-4 in the final set, but managed to hold serve, break Safarova and hold again for the win.         
	Yesterday (Wednesday), I think I did too many things wrong. She just was firing for every shot and making them, Williams said. Obviously with the delay, (there) was a lot of things to think about beforehand, what I could do different, and just tried to be as aggressive as I could.         
	The last two sets, you know, it was close. But these kind of matches are really rewarding, and she was playing well. But I felt like I deserved it.         
	Jankovic had an easier time, moving a step closer to her third straight semi-final appearance at Roland Garros by beating Magdalena Rybarikova 6-1, 6-2.         
	I think Im coming back, said Jankovic, who started this season as the top-ranked player in womens tennis. This is the most important thing for me, especially when you saw me playing a few months ago. It was really disastrous.         
	Fifth seed Jankovic won 15 of the first 17 points, and then broke her opponent in the final game of the first set. In the second, she recovered from an early break to win four straight games, and closed out the match with her sixth break of service.         
	Jankovic lost in the semi-finals at Roland Garros in each of the last two years. She made her first Grand Slam final at the 2008 US Open.         
	Im trying to, little by little, play more aggressive and move into the net as much as I can, and, you know, try to improve my serve, Jankovic said.         
	Seventh seed Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia also advanced, beating Galina Voskoboeva of Kazakhstan 6-0, 6-2. No.10 Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark and No.24 Aleksandra Wozniak of Canada also won, but seeded French players Marion Bartoli and Alize Cornet lost. The 13th seed Bartoli, who reached the Wimbledon semi-finals last year, lost to Tathiana Garbin of Italy 6-3, 7-5, while No.21 Cornet fell to Sorana Cristea of Romania 6-3, 6-2.         
	On the mens side, fifth seed Juan Martin del Potro defeated Viktor Troicki of Serbia 6-3, 7-5, 6-0. No.10 Nikolay Davydenko and No.16 Tommy Robredo of Spain also advanced.         
	Also, Andy Roddick entered the third round of the French Open for the first time since 2001.         
	Sixth seed Roddick beat 85th-ranked Ivo Minar of the Czech Republic 6-2, 6-2, 7-6(7-2) Thursday to match his best showing at Roland Garros. (AP)

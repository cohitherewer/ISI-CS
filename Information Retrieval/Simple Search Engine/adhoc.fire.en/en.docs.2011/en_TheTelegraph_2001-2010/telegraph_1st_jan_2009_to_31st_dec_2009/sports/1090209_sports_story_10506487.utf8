                                                   I proved a point, says Yuvraj
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Colombo: Indias swashbuckling left-hander Yuvraj Singh picked Sachin Tendulkar for special praise after being adjudged Man of the Series against Sri Lanka on Sunday.         
	The southpaw totalled 284 runs at an average of 56.80 in the five-match ODI series against the islanders.         
	Speaking during the prize distribution ceremony, Yuvraj said: This (award) is second in a row for me. I had a bad series the last time I came here, so I was determined to turn it around. I proved a point.         
	There was little doubt about playing the spinners.         
	A big thanks to Sachin for helping me out at the nets and I also want to thank my teammates and the coaching staff who helped me play to my strength.         
	Yuvraj scored a century and two half centuries in the five innings he played.         
	He also picked up four wickets with his brand of left-arm spin.         
	The Punjab batsman said he had been in good form coming into the series. Yuvraj had scored 325 runs with two centuries in Indias 5-0 home series win against England.         
	I was in good form coming into this series. I was hitting the ball well I knew I have the potential to score quicker than run-a-ball, he said.         
	Asked if he had made changes in his batting after putting up a sorry performance the last time India toured Sri Lanka, Yuvraj said he had made minor adjustments.         
	I havent changed a lot in my batting. Just changed a few things here and there. You learn more as you continue playing, he said.         
	Yuvraj scored a scintillating 73 off 62 balls on Sunday in the fifth ODI which Sri Lanka won by 68 runs. The southpaw hit 11 boundaries and a six in his innings.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | With team in crisis, Ponting break over
                                                   With team in crisis, Ponting break over
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Australia captain Ricky Ponting will return to the team for the crucial third one-day International against New Zealand to be played in Sydney Sunday, according to information forwarded by Cricket Australia (CA).         
	Ponting, who had earlier been rested for the second and third ODIs, has himself wanted to play as Australia would lose the fivematch series if they lose in Sydney.         
	National selection panel (NSP) chairman Andrew Hilditch said that Ponting had been asked to rest for the Melbourne and Sydney ODIs as part of long-term workload planning. However, Ricky has today made a strong appeal to be allowed to play given that this is a decider, he said.         
	Given the circumstance, we have made an on-balance decision to support his request and we will continue to monitor his workload closely, he added.         
	Hilditch also said: It should be noted that selectors were pleased with Michael Clarkes leadership and batting form in Melbourne, where he was the Man of the match but this decision will bolster our batting. We also understand Rickys desire to lead from the front.         
	A defeat Sunday would see Australia lose six one-dayers in a row only for the second time in their history. Pontings men have already lost the top spot in ICC ODI rankings to South Africa after losing a five-match series against the Proteas last month, and have now slumped to third behind India.         
	The squad for the last two ODIs will be selected after Sundays match.         
	Australia had started the trend of rotating key players to ensure they are fresh for the important tours but now that they are in trouble, rotation seems to have lost favour with the management.

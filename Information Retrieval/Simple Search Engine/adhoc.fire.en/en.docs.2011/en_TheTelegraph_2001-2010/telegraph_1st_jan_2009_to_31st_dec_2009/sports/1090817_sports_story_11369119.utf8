The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rahul back after 22 months
                                                   Rahul back after 22 months
    - Amit Mishra is no more a Test specialist; rohit Sharma gets the boot           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: The national selectors formally met on Sunday morning, but the squads for the tri-series in Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in South Africa were actually finalised during an informal session the previous evening, in Chennai itself.         
	Krishnamachari Srikkanth and his colleagues (Yashpal Sharma, Narendra Hirwani, Surendra Bhave and Raja Venkat), therefore, didnt have much to discuss at the meeting proper, attended by only one of the two co-opted members, Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	Coach Gary Kirsten wasnt around. Apparently, he has gone back to South Africa and will return before the preparatory camp at the end of this month.         
	It was very smooth... With Virender Sehwag himself not sounding confident, the selectors kept him out of the equation during their informal session... It was at the meeting proper that the Board informed them Sehwag wouldnt be able to play before September 17, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	 The selectors had, by then, already made up their mind on picking a common squad for both tournaments. Such a possibility had been reported in these columns on Saturday.         
	While the tri-series is from September 8-14, with New Zealand being the third team, the Champions Trophy has been scheduled between September 22-October 5.         
	Sehwag, who underwent surgery on his right shoulder two months ago, hasnt played any form of cricket since the Delhi DareDevils versus the Deccan Chargers IPL semi-final, on May 22. Thats when he got injured.         
	Given the circumstances, with Sehwag and Zaheer Khan (who, too, has undergone surgery) not available, the selectors have done a fine job.         
	This selection committee has, of course, authored a course correction. As a result, former captain Rahul Dravid has been a beneficiary. His 333rd and last ODI had been 22 months ago.         
	However, Sehwags surgery and the inability of the top-order to handle the short-pitched stuff, both during the World T20 in England and on the short tour of the West Indies, forced the selectors to fall back on the 36-year-olds technique and experience.         
	After a 49-match forced break, Dravids expected to provide all the solidity at No.3.         
	The move to bring Dravid back came from Srikkanth, when he and his colleagues sat down to name the 30 Champions Trophy probables. If it works, and theres no reason to assume it wont, then the chairman will need to be congratulated.         
	 Dravids recall means that age isnt a factor or, at least, not an obsession with the men who matter. Thats one message, from the selectors, which has gone out loud and clear.         
	 Another, most definitely, is that performance counts, not so much potential. The dropping of Rohit Sharma, whose list of admirers is headed by Sunil Gavaskar, let exactly that be known.         
	That had also been conveyed, pretty recently, when Irfan Pathan wasnt found good enough to feature among the Champions Trophy probables. Elder brother Yusuf has, on the other hand, more or less cemented his place in the shorter forms of cricket.         
	In a bold move, the selectors have peeled off the Fit For Tests Only label from leggie Amit Mishra. His last ODI was as far back as April 2003, but hed been tipped by this newspaper to make a comeback.         
	Mishra is an attacking bowler and, with Zaheer absent, the XI could do with somebody hungry for wickets. Pragyan Ojha, the left-arm spinner who got omitted, is of the restrictive kind.         
	Significantly, Mishra (26) made a big impression in the Emerging Players meet in Australia, which was won by India.         
	As expected, Sachin Tendulkar and Suresh Raina, who hadnt gone to the West Indies for the four ODIs, have returned to the squad.         
	Sachin had taken a break then, while Raina had a fitness issue.

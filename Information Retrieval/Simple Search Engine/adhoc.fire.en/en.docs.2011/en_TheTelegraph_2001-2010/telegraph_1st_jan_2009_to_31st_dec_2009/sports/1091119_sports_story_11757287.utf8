The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ramzi stripped of gold 
                                                                                                                                   Ramzi stripped of gold 
                      
	London: Middle-distance runner Rashid Ramzi has been stripped of his 1,500-metre Olympic gold medal for doping, officials with knowledge of the decision said on Wednesday.         
	Ramzi was one of five athletes from the 2008 Beijing Games who tested positive in April for CERA, an advanced version of the blood-boosting drug EPO, in new tests using retroactive blood samples.         
	On Tuesday, Italian cyclist Davide Rebellin was stripped of his silver medal in the Beijing road race for a positive CERA test.         
	The other athletes from Beijing who tested positive were German cyclist Stefan Schumacher, Croatian 800-metre runner Vanja Perisic, and Greek race walker Athanasia Tsoumeleka. They did not win medals.         
	The Moroccan-born Ramzi was the only gold medallist from Beijing caught using performance-enhancing drugs. He gave Bahrain their first Olympic track and field gold medal with victory in the 1,500. He could also now face a two-year ban from the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). Under IOC rules, he also is banned from the 2012 London Olympics.         
	Sebastian Coe, who won two 1,500 Olympic titles and is an IAAF vice president, praised the stripping of Ramzis medal.         
	That was the right decision, Coe said. Cheats cannot prosper in our sport and people will realise that sooner or later. Unfortunately, that was high profile and we can do without it, but it also shows the quality of our testing procedures now.         
	Asbel Kipruto Kiprop of Kenya stands to be upgraded from silver to gold in the 1,500.           (AP)

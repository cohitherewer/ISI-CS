                                                     TFA drubbing shocks Subhas
            A STAFF REPORTER            Subhas Bhowmick at the Barasat Stadium on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: On Tuesday, East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick got a relief as the Central Bureau of Investigation closed the disproportionate assets case against him. Two days later, the veteran coach is once again plagued by a problem  only this time a matter which is very much on-field than off it.         
	East Bengals 1-3 drubbing at the hands of the young boys of the Tata Football Academy in the IFA Shield group league encounter left him shocked and to put it in his own words, he was responsible for the debacle.         
	Its shocking Its absolutely shocking. Ive no words to explain the situation. My head has gone blank, a dejected Bhowmick said at the post-match interaction with the media.         
	Admitting that his fancied team was outplayed by the Jamshedpur side, he said: We failed in all the departments Nothing worked for us today. We simply played bad football and there cant be any excuse for that. No explanations are adequate to summarise our performance.         
	The red-and-gold brigade were a disjointed unit in the game Thursday as the midfield was devoid of any co-ordination. My midfielders disappointed today and what worried me most was the fact that there was no blocking in the midfield. That cost us dear, observed Bhowmick.         
	He went on to add that his move to substitute striker Subhas Singh with Gautam Kujur with the intention to bolster the midfield was wrong plan that backfired.         
	I wanted to strengthen the midfield and so brought on Gautam. But I must admit that it was a mistake, he said.         
	East Bengal defenders were inconsistent as well as the young TFA guns left them high and dry for better part of the match. I shouldnt have tinkered with the defensive combination that I was using during the Myanmar tour. That unsettled the boys and the defence failed to gel, said Bhowmick.         
	Bhowmick was also disappointed with the performance of Czech recruit Jan Berger as he said: Im a disappointed with his show I expected more from him.         
	He failed to keep up the good job he did in the practice matches.         
	With his head hanging down, a pensive Subhas Bhowmick signed off saying: This is one of the most shocking defeats of my career.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger stalks, Jeev stutters 
                                                   Tiger stalks, Jeev stutters 
                      
	Chaska: Tiger Woods shot a bogey-free 5-under 67 to build a one-shot lead over defending champion Padraig Harrington in an ideal start to the US PGA Championship on Thursday, his last chance this year to win a Major.         
	It was only the third time that Woods has opened a Major with a bogey-free round  the other two were at the US Open and British Open in 2000, which he won by a combined 23 shots.         
	Meanwhile, Jeev Milkha Singh found himself at tied 69th with a mundane two-over 74. Eyeing an encore of his top-10 finish in the PGA Championship last year, Jeev had a rather sedate front nine where birdies on the first and seventh holes more than made up for the stroke he dropped on the fourth.

                                                   No end to Bhaichung row
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Any hope for an amicable solution to the Bhaichung Bhutia-Mohun Bagan impasse continued to be a distant dream as the officials of the green and maroon brigade refused to budge from their stand on Monday.         
	The two senior Mohun Bagan officials who held a meeting with the All India Football Federation (AIFF) general secretary Alberto Colaco on Monday, said they were not interested in releasing Bhutia for the current season.         
	The general secretary was kind enough to give us a patient hearing, said the Mohun Bagan secretary, Anjan Mitra. We told him that Bhutia is our legally contracted player for the 2009-10 season and there is no question of releasing him at the moment.         
	Moreover, we have suspended Bhutia on disciplinary ground. He has no right to cross over to another club. We have also apprised the general secretary of the decision taken by the executive committee of the club, Mitra added.         
	Colaco said he was still looking for an amicable solution that he would place in front of the committee that authorised him to mediate in the matter.         
	An AIFF official feared it would be difficult to find a solution if both the parties refuse to climb down from their positions. Instead of interfering, the AIFF should have allowed the IFA to take a decision on this subject, the official said.         
	The federation officials, however, are confident that the suspension notice would not be an hindrance for Bhutia to play in the Nehru Cup. The suspension is meaningless unless it is approved by the IFA, said an official.

                                                   Indians seek redemption
  - SECOND TWENTY20 INTERNATIONAL TODAY                         
	Wellington: World champions India would seek to restore their pride, after being trounced in the first match, as they go into the second and final Twenty20 International against New Zealand here Friday. The visitors are fully aware that only an inspired show will help them level the series.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhonis young bravehearts reputation as kings of Twenty20 took a beating by the seven-wicket defeat in Christchurch. A win Friday would prove that Wednesdays loss was an aberration. A victory will also boost Indias morale ahead of the five-match ODI series starting on March 3.         
	However, the visitors will have to do a lot of catching up as the New Zealanders have the distinct advantage of having bowling all-rounders in their ranks unlike India, who rely on their batsmen to bowl in the middle-overs.         
	The lack of a genuine all-rounder is beginning to prove quite costly. Only Ravindra Jadeja seems to fall in this category, but the youngster from Rajkot may not find the team managements favour yet.         
	The defeat in Christchurch could have prompted the Indian think-tank to consider an alternative for Irfan Pathan, who had courageously won India a cliffhanger in his brothers company a fortnight ago in Sri Lanka.         
	 Irfan had emerged on the international arena as a bowling all-rounder, but of late he has been more productive with the bat than the ball.         
	Under the conditions here, a bowler of Praveen Kumars ability would be more effective than Irfan, who conceded as many as 38 runs in three overs in the first Twenty20. But Dhonis penchant for a deep batting line-up may yet see Irfan get the nod ahead of the Uttar Pradesh seamer, who has this uncanny ability of picking up top-order wickets.         
	Although Dhoni blamed the batsmen for the debacle, the Indian captain would do well to analyse that India were outplayed by the more athletic Kiwis, who fielded with the alacrity of a leopard and batted with calmness. Only if Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh and Yusuf Pathan produce scores in excess of 50, can India hope to deprive the hosts of a much-sought after series victory. Sehwag and Yusuf cleared the dwarfed boundaries at the AMI stadium in Christchurch consistently, making 26 and 20 respectively, but failed to keep the momentum going. If only they could apply themselves like Suresh Raina, their unbridled belligerence would be of value to India.         
	Having taken the lead in the series, the Black Caps would be keen to complete a 2-0 rout, which they are immensely capable of, before the five-match one-day series kick starts in Napier. New Zealand coach Andy Moles believes his boys could achieve their goal.         
	The boys know they are up against a very, very talented Indian side. We have got our noses in front, and we want to stay there. It is a two-match series and we want to win it. The boys are looking forward to the challenge that lies ahead of them, he said.         
	Moles thinks India, after their seven-wicket loss in the tour opener, have now got a fair idea about the New Zealand players and would come back strongly.         
	They know we are a good side. They have seen us operate last night, and they wont be taking anything for granted, a cautious Moles said.         
	According to him, the hosts would have to improve their game in all areas to thwart an Indian backlash.         
	We are looking at all areas. While bowling, we didnt hit the hole we wanted to. In fielding, we were good overall but we can be better. Perhaps we are struggling a bit with our batting at the top of the order. We are not going to stand still. As a team we are looking to get better with every game, Moles said.         
	He also praised McCullum for his match-winning innings in Wednesdays match. It was a good innings. He just struggled to get going as the wicket was two-paced. He had to play the supporting role to see the side home. He can assess the situation while he is out there and adjust his game accordingly, said Moles.

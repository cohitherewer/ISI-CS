                                                   Chetri dismay
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Striker Sunil Chetri missed an opportunity to play for English championships club Queens Park Rangers (QPR) when his application for a work permit was rejected by the British government.         
	I had signed a three-year contract with Rangers a few weeks back and was waiting for my work permit, said Chetri on Saturday. Sadly, it has got rejected, my agent informed me on Friday.         
	His application for permit, however, has been rejected not for want of skills. As per the British law, an outstation footballer coming from a country ranked below 70 in the Fifa rankings needs to get a work permit to play for an English club.

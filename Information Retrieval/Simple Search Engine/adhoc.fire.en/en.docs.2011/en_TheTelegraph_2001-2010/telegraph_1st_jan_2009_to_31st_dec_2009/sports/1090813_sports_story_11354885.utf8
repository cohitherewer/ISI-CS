The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England to consider Ramprakash 
                                                   England to consider Ramprakash 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                       
	London: The possibility of Marcus Trescothick making a dramatic return to the England side to face Australia in the deciding Ashes Test at the Oval has been dismissed by England selector Geoff Miller although Mark Ramprakashs case will be discussed.         
	Miller insists he wont ask Somerset batsman Trescothick to come out of international retirement for the fifth and final Test of a series that is level at 1-1.         
	After losing to Australia by an innings and 80 runs in the fourth Test at Headingley, Andrew Strausss team must win the final match of the five-Test series to regain the Ashes, whereas a draw would be enough for Australia to keep the urn.         
	With Kevin Pietersen injured, England have been struggling for runs, leading to suggestions that Trescothick could be tempted back for one match. He has been in superb form for Somerset since retiring from England duty due to a stress-related illness and the opening batsman had indicated that he would listen if England approached him. But Miller ruled out that option, insisting that he will not try to change the 33-year-olds mind.         
	Marcus has many times said hes retired from international cricket, and until I hear contrary to that, he will not be a part of the selection process, Miller said.         
	He knows where he is, hes really comfortable and playing really, really well, but hes retired from Test cricket so hes not a part of our thoughts at this moment in time.         
	But Miller admitted the selectors will consider 39-year-old Ramprakash when they sit down to discuss the squad for the Oval clash.         
	Mark has not stated hes not available for international cricket, so we will discuss that, Miller said.         
	Its not just my decision, its a team decision, and well sit down as a unit. We have a consistency and continuity angle as far as selection policy is concerned and we try to stick to that as much as possible.         
	But we do want to win this series, which is a matter of winning this game in a one-match situation, so its a very difficult equation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 6 world records on Day II
                                                     6 world records on Day II
                  Sarah Sjostrom                     
	Rome: Sarah Sjostrom of Sweden kept up the assault on the record books at the World Swimming Championships, breaking the mark she set a day earlier to win the 100-metre butterfly. Six world records were set in all.         
	Sjostrom touched in 56.06 seconds on Monday, easily knocking off her semi-final time of 56.44. Australias Jess Schipper also went lower than the previous record (56.23) to take silver. Chinas Jiao Liuyang claimed bronze in 56.86.         
	Sjostrom set her latest record after Brenton Rickard of Australia set the first world mark of the second day. He won the 100m breaststroke in 58.58, beating the mark of 58.91 set by Japans Kosuke Kitajima at last years Olympics.         
	Rebecca Soni of the US set the ninth world record of the championships, breaking her own mark in the 100m breaststroke. Not even bothering to wait until the finals, Soni touched with a time of 1 minute, 4.84 seconds in her semi-final heat. That knocked off the record of 1:05.09 held since 2006 by Australias Leisel Jones.         
	Russias Anastasia Zueva set the 10th world record at the meet, breaking the mark for the 100m backstroke in the semi-final heat.         
	Zueva posted a time of 58.48 seconds, eclipsing the mark of 58.77 by Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe that won gold at the Beijing Olympics.         
	Ariana Kukors of the United States closed out another speedy night at the pool, breaking her 24-hour-old world record in the 200m individual medley.         
	Kukors beat Olympic champion Stephanie Rice of Australia with a time of 2 minutes, 6.15 seconds on Monday, nearly a full second ahead of the Americans record showing in the semi-finals, 2:07.03.         
	Kukors didnt even qualify for the 200 IM at the US championships this month, but she got in when teammate Elizabeth Pelton decided to scratch to focus on the 100 backstroke. Not a good move by Pelton, who was knocked out of that event in the semi-finals.         
	However, US swimming star Aaron Peirsol stunningly failed to qualify for the final of the 100m backstroke.         
	Peirsol only managed the ninth-best time in the semifinals  a stunning development considering he won the 100m back at the last two Olympics and was a big favorite to capture another title after setting a world record in the 100m back this month. But his semi-final time of 53.22 was nearly a full second behind top qualifier Junya Koga of Japan at 52.39. Peirsol was a tenth of a second out of the eighth spot, which would have gotten him through to the final.         
	Serbias Milorad Cavic upset Spanish favourite Rafael Munoz to win gold in the 50m butterfly. Cavic charged to victory with a championship record time of 22.67 seconds.         
	Matt Targett of Australia took the silver medal while Spanish world record holder Munoz, who himself a set a new championship mark in to qualify top in the semi-final, could do no better than third.

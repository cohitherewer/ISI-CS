            A CORRESPONDENT            Sachin Tendulkar in Napier on Sunday. (Reuters)                           
	Napier: New Zealand coach Andy Moles said a draw is the most likely result of the second Test after the fourth days play. He hoped that a little bit of luck should go the visitors way on the last day for them to win the Test to square the series.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The performance of the Indian batsmen on Sunday         
	Its been a tough day. Obviously it has been a great day to bat Good weather, excellent wicket. We stuck to our task very well during the day. There is still only one team turning up tomorrow (Monday) that can win the Test match and its not often that we have been in that position. They have played well, they stuck to their disciplines but we have also showed exceptional discipline with our bowling. We hope tomorrow that a little bit of luck goes our way and we can get the opportunity to push for the win that I think we deserve.         
	The likely outcome of the Test match         
	Draw would be the favourite result but it only takes a couple of good catches and a special spell by somebody. It is an exceptionally good batting wicket and they have got some exceptional players, who have played well on it. If we can get our intensity right and hit the right areas, all we are looking for is two or three mistakes.         
	The wicket         
	Everybody would admit that it is an exceptional batting wicket. Its very very hard and therefore it is very difficult to see any real wear and tear on the surface over the five days. I dare say if we started today (Sunday), we could still play another five days on it and it will still be an exceptional surface.         
	The condition of the New Zealand players         
	They are sore, theres no injury. Obviously they are a little bit tired. When you make teams follow-on, you obviously do get a bit tired. Good teams spend a lot of time on the field, so my message to the team is, get used to it. If we are going to become a good Test side, it is about getting big scores and then making teams follow on.         
	If NZ shouldnt have asked India to follow on         
	The only way we had to win was to enforce the follow-on.         
	Mondays first session         
	Youd like a brand new one tomorrow The boys will be fresh in the morning. The batters have got to get themselves back in again, so it will be a good challenge in the morning for both sides. The first hour will be crucial, the first session.         
	New Zealand having dominated the Test         
	Five-six days ago, we were underdogs, we were playing against a side against whom we were out of our depth. That was a lot of the theme that came across from the questions I was being asked by certain sections of the media. I think we have had an excellent Test match. There is a lot of confidence in our dressing room at the moment. If things dont go well tomorrow, its a game drawn. The Indians will know that come next week we are a better side than we were when we came to Napier. The way that the Indians have played today probably shows a little bit more respect for New Zealand. Certainly, up until today, there has been some loose cricket and today we saw some very good batting from some very good players.

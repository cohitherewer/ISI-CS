The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin not in favour of neutral venues
                                                   Sachin not in favour of neutral venues
                      
	Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar Friday said he was not in favour of playing matches at neutral venues as it takes away much of the charm.         
	I dont agree with the neutral venue. Whenever a team plays it should play in front of the crowd which is against them or behind them ... even at the international level, Sachin said when asked about his feelings before playing the Ranji Trophy final against Uttar Pradesh in Hyderabad from Monday.         
	We get very few matches to play at neutral venues such as World Cup or Champions Trophy, otherwise through most part of our careers we play in the opponents country or at home.         
	The 35-year-old was felicitated by the Mumbai Cricket Association for being the first cricketer to cross the 12,000-run mark. Tendulkar said he was not worried about the future of Tests in the wake of ODIs and Twenty20 matches but rather about dwindling attendance in the longer version of the game.         
	Test cricket has its own place. There is no threat to Test cricket from IPL or Twenty20 or even 50-over matches. But I am only concerned about the falling attendance for Test matches in India, he said.         
	I have a suggestion to the BCCI. Whenever Test cricket is played, local school and college students should be allowed free entry on weekends, he said. (PTI)

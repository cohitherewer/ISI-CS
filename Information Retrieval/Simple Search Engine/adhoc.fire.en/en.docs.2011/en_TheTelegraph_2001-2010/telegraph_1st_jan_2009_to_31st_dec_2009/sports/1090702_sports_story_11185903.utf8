The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal bodies merge
                                                   Bengal bodies merge
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal Hockey Association (BHA) president J.B. Roy Wednesday claimed that the creation of an unified state body for hockey will be a step towards fair elections in a democratic manner to a umbrella body for hockey administration in India.         
	In conformity with the Federation of International Hockey (FIH) directive, endorsed by the Indian Olympic Association, and at the initiative of the Bengal Olympic Association, the Womens Hockey Association of Bengal merged with the BHA on Wednesday.         
	BHA will henceforth be looking after hockey activities for both men and women in the state.         
	I dont want to say anything on Hockey India, but I hope this merger would help create a democratically elected body for the national hockey. This should also serve as a precedent for the other state associations, Roy said.         
	Roy, who is also the leader of the rival faction in Indian hockey, has in the past expressed dissatisfaction with the hockey administration in the country.         
	Meanwhile, Gurbux Singh, secretary of the BHA, said he hoped that the association would work together for the betterment of the game.         
	This is a very positive step. Two separate associations for men and women in a game is ridiculous It happens nowhere in the world. Now that we have an unified body, hockey in the state should improve.

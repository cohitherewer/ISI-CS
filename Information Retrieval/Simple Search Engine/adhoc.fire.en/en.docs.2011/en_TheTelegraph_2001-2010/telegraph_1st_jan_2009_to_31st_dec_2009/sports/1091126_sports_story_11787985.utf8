	Calcutta: Edeh Chidi scored his third hattrick of the season Wednesday as Mohun Bagan won their second Calcutta Football League premier division match on the trot with a 4-0 drubbing of Kalighat Milan Samity at the club ground.

	Midfielder Ishfaq Ahmeds freekick put the green and maroon brigade ahead in the 26th minute. As the ball bounced in front of goal, Chidi attempted a header but missed. Keeper Debjit Majumar failed to collect the ball and it rolled into the far corner.         
	It was in the second-half that Chidi turned on the style.         
	Tomba Singhs shot hit Kalighat defender Abuchis hand in the penalty area and referee Ajit Dutta pointed to the spot. Chidi slotted it home past the hapless keeper with ease. It was the 50th minute.Four minutes later the Nigerian scored his second.

	The hattrick came in the dying moments of the match, in the 89th minute. Collecting a pass from Tomba Singh in the midfield, Chidi sprinted towards the goal for a clean finish, beating a couple of defenders and the keeper on the way.         
	Bagans new Japanese recruit, Ryuji Sueoka, who made his debut in the 57th minute as Branco Cardozos replacement, impressed the crowd with his skills.         
	Three minutes in, the Japanese, wearing jersey No.15  Bhaichung Bhutias shirt number at the club  played a pass to Tomba Singh, got it back and unleashed one but Majumdar made no mistake in collecting the ball.

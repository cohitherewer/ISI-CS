                                                     Ponting lost cool: Report
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Ponting                           
	Birmingham: Ricky Pontings anger boiled over during the drawn third Test here as he smashed a dressing-room door at Edgbaston on Sunday.         
	According to a report in a newspaper, Ponting lost his temper after being dismissed by Graeme Swann in the second innings of the Test here.         
	Already chastened by the pantomime villain boos when he came out to bat, Ponting lost his rag after being bowled by Graeme Swanns ball-of-the-century contender on Sunday evening  and a door bore the brunt of his anger, the newspaper reported.         
	Host club Warwickshire made light of the incident and their cricket operations manager Keith Cook said: We have to make all sorts of running repairs all over the ground. Ive not had any complaints, but if a batsman has lost his temper when hes out, it wouldnt be the first time.         
	Meanwhile, Australia vice-captain Michael Clarke will not train Wednesday after suffering a minor abdominal strain during his match-saving undefeated 103 on Monday, according to a Cricket Australia release.         
	Team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said: Michael Clarke has an abdominal strain that became sore after the completion of Mondays game. He will continue to be treated with a view to him being fit for the fourth Test beginning on Friday.

                                                   Roy using money power: Batra 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Jammu and Kashmir Hockey Association (JKHA) on Thursday accused the Bengal Hockey Association (BHA) president J.B. Roy of using money power to buy support of the state associations.         
	In a press release, the JKHA president Narinder Batra claimed that most of the 28 state association members, who attended the meeting called by the BHA chief on Wednesday, were not eligible voters in the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) elections.         
	The JKHA secretary Jagjit Singh, according to Batra, had no mandate from the state association to attend the meeting. All the other members, the JKHA chief claimed, were provided with free air tickets, free hotel accommodation and were paid Rs. 50,000 to Rs. one lakh each to attend the meeting.         
	Batra said some of the members were misleading the BHA president.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India hold China 1-1
                                                                                                                                   India hold China 1-1
                      
	Bangkok: India held formidable opponents China 1-1 in their penultimate Group A match to inch towards the semi-finals of the Womens Asia Cup hockey Tuesday.         
	India now need just a draw against Malaysia in their last group match Wednesday to make the semis.         
	It was the Chinese who opened the scoring with Liao Jia Hui hitting the target in the 18th minute from the first penalty corner they earned.         
	But Saba Anjum equalised for India in the 45th minute, converting a short corner.         
	India are yet to lose a match in the tournament and have routed Singapore and Thailand 13-0 and 15-0 respectively in their first two group matches. With two wins and a draw, both India and China have seven points though Malaysia still have a chance of entering the last-four.         
	On an overcast day, the Indians made their intentions clear from the beginning and played aggressive hockey forcing the Chinese on to the backfoot.         
	But wayward shooting by the forwards let India down. The attacking duo of Jasjeet Kaur and Rani Ramphal were off-colour with the former missing two open chances. (PTI)

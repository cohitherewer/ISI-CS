	Warsaw: Maria Sharapova eased past Darya Kustova of Belarus 6-2, 6-0 on Wednesday to reach the quarter finals of the Warsaw Open, her first singles tournament since coming back from shoulder surgery.         
	The three-time Grand Slam title winner needed only 57 minutes to eliminate Kustova.         
	I played a solid game and did everything that I had to do in order to win, Sharapova said. More importantly right now than ever, is just to do the right things and to work on my game. It doesnt really matter who Im playing.         
	The Russian had surgery for a torn rotator cuff last year and missed the past two Grand Slam tournaments. She said the shoulder hasnt bothered her in Warsaw, and the only sign of the injury on Wednesday were two strips of white tape on her right shoulder.         
	Im really enjoying myself, and after putting in so much work and being out for so long, it just gives you so much satisfaction to know that the work that you put in at some point is going to bring you victories, she said.         
	But right now its just a thrill to be out there and competing.         
	Sharapova, who is playing in her first Womens Tennis Association (WTA) tour singles tournament in nearly 10 months, is trying to regain the form that led her to the No. 1 ranking in 2005. She slid to No. 126 in the rankings while sidelined with the injury, but despite showing a few signs of rust, she didnt face much of a challenge from the 209th ranked Kustova.         
	Sharapova broke the Belarusian in the second game of the first set, and her only slip of the match came when she double faulted when leading 40 to hand Kustova a break.         
	But she quickly recovered and claimed the first set with a forehand winner that clipped the baseline.         
	Despite the two wins in two matches, Sharapova stressed she still faced a long road back to her championship form.         
	I think its going to take time. I think I still need match play, and being in different situations in the matches is going to give me that feeling back and that experience back, she said.         
	Looking ahead to her quarter final matchup with eighthseeded Alona Bondarenko, a 6-3, 6-1 winner over Marta Domachowska of Poland earlier Wednesday, Sharapova said she expects a challenge from the Ukrainian.         
	Shes in good form, she plays a really good defensive game but she can also step in and hit the ball, Sharapova said. Shes a good opponent for me to play.         
	In other second round action, sixth-seeded Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia beat Urszula Radwanska of Poland 6-3, 6-1, Klara Zakopalova of the Czech Republic upended third-seeded Zheng Jie of China 6-0, 6-4, and qualifier Alexandra Dulgheru of Romania upset fifth-seeded Sara Errani of Italy 6-4, 6-3.         
	Also, Anne Keothavong of Britain downed Jill Craybas of the United States 3-6, 6-3, 6-1, Galina Voskoboeva of Kazakhstan beat Kateryna Bondarenko of Ukraine 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) and Ioana Raluca Olaru of Romania eliminated Julia Goerges of Germany 6-3, 0-6, 7-6 (7-3).

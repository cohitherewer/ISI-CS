                                                   Win a balm for Mahesh
            OUR CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Melbourne/Mumbai: Mahesh Bhupathi and Sania Mirza registered their first Grand Slam title together, crushing Andy Ram and Nathalie Dechy in straight sets in the mixed doubles final of the Australian Open here Sunday.         
	The Indian wild-card pair proved too good for the Israeli-French duo, taking only 55 minutes to thrash them 6-3, 6-1.         
	The win also gave Bhupathi his 11th Grand Slam title  seventh in mixed doubles. For Sania, it was her maiden Grand Slam title. The pair also got richer by $134,460 (Aus).         
	The Indians started the match on a confident note, breaking Ram in the opening game and then Bhupathi held his serve to go 2-0 up.         
	They, however, could not hold on to their lead for long as Mirza lost her serve in the fourth game to hand the Ram-Dechy duo the opportunity to level the scores at 2-2.         
	Bhupathi and Sania were soon in their elements, breaking Dechy and going 4-3 up.         
	Subsequently, Sania held her serve and then rounded off the set with an immaculate forehand volley on Rams serve.         
	The Indians showed no mercy in the second set and breezed to the title.         
	Following the match, Bhupathi said that Sundays victory had come as a relief to him after the heart-breaking defeat in the mens doubles final Saturday.         
	Bhupathi, however said that the victory would make up for the loss in the mens doubles final on Saturday, but only to an extent.         
	They are two sets of things. Obviously doubles is a big thing for me. I am glad I won the mixed doubles but I dont want that to overshadow the career Grand Slam, Bhupathi told The Telegraph.         
	Bhupathi had a word of praise for Mirza. She has always been a great player. We complement each other, he said.         
	The 34-year-old Bhupathi said he wants to continue playing with Sania in the remaining three Grand Slams as well.         
	Well, you know, for us, its always four Slams where we have the opportunity to play mixed. Ideally Id like to continue playing with her, now that were doing so well, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Special to lead, says Shukla
                                                     Special to lead, says Shukla
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT              Laxmi Ratan Shukla                      
	Calcutta: It was no more than a T20 warm-up match, that too which ended in defeat, but Laxmi Ratan Shukla will still remember Tuesdays game against Free State as pretty special.         
	He was, after all, the nominated captain in the Kolkata Knight Riders first competitive match overseas.         
	Bahut achcha laga Ive been the Bengal captain for two seasons and, so, captaincy isnt something new Lekin, this was a different experience Rather special because the game was played outside India, Shukla told The Telegraph.         
	As for different leaders on the park, Shukla said: Look, I set the fields with help from the wicket-keeper (Morne van Wyk) and after consulting the bowlers         
	Like John Buchanan, Shukla insisted that much shouldnt be read into the defeats (Aakash Chopra captained in the second match).         
	Our team was heavy with bowlers, not so much with batsmen It will be different when Dada (Sourav Ganguly) and the others (Chris Gayle, Brendon McCullum) take the field, Shukla pointed out.         
	Shukla, of course, is saddened by the injury to wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha. They say he could be fine in 16-18 days Lets hope so

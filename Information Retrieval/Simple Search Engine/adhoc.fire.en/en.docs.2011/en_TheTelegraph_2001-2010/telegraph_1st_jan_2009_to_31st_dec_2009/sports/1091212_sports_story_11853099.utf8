	London: Chelseas priority in the Premier League is banishing defensive lapses, while Manchester Uniteds is to not let a lack of players to fill the back-four hurt them.         
	Chelsea, who lost at Manchester City last weekend, lead Manchester United by two points going into Saturdays match against Everton.         
	It has been a bit of a bumpy week and we need to bounce back at the weekend and get back to winning ways, Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole said. The next five Premier League games are very important  the Christmas period is always vital. We want to still be sitting on top of the league at the start of January.         
	By then, the league season would have passed its halfway mark  and thats when United manager Alex Ferguson has targeted a return to the top as he chases a fourth straight title.         
	The collapse at City, coupled with Tuesdays 2-2 draw with APOEL Nicosia in the Champions League and the previous weeks League Cup elimination at Blackburn, exposed frailties in the Chelsea team.         
	Its got to be a real wake-up call, Chelsea captain John Terry said. Were still top by two points and this emphasises that the Premier Leagues not a walk, its a big, big battle.         
	Before the end of 2009, the Blues also have home games against last-place Portsmouth and Fulham, along with potentially tricky away matches at West Ham United and resurgent Birmingham City.         
	Midfielder Michael Essien will be absent for the next month after tearing a hamstring in the meaningless Champions League match when first place in group D had already been secured. Striker Salomon Kalou is also sidelined.         
	The Red Devils are looking for a fourth straight league win Saturday when they host Aston Villa, who are eight points behind United at fifth.         
	We wont take our foot off the pedal now, said United midfielder Michael Carrick, who is likely to start in central defence alongside Nemanja Vidic due to the injury crisis.         
	We are starting to play well now and we are scoring some goals so we want that to continue. There is an awful long way to go and we are not getting carried away.         
	Patrice Evra and Vidic are the only regular United defenders who are fit, with Rio Ferdinand, John Shea, Jonny Evans, Gary Neville, Wes Brown, the Da Silva brothers, Rafael and Fabio, all set to be out. Wayne Rooney, Dimitar Berbatov and Ryan Giggs should all be available to reinforce Fergusons squad at Old Trafford after recovering from injuries.         
	Also Saturday, its: Birmingham vs. West Ham; Bolton vs. Manchester City; Burnley vs. Fulham; Hull vs. Blackburn; Stoke vs. Wigan; Sunderland vs. Portsmouth; and Tottenham vs. Wolverhampton.         
	Sundays only match is a meeting between third-place Arsenal and Liverpool, who areseventh. (AP)

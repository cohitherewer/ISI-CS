                                                   Vidit hogs limelight
            BIPIN SHENOY                      
	Calcutta: The second day of the Kolkata Open belonged to world U-14 boys champion, Vidit Santosh Gujrathi, who outclassed Indian GM G. N. Gopal at Gorky Sadan on Wednesday.         
	As many as three Grandmasters lost to their lesser-rated rivals. Himanshu Sharma of Haryana upset defending champion Viktor Laznica in another interesting battle while Neelotpal Das succumbed to Arjun Tiwari.         
	In the most sensational upset of the day, Vidit decimated Gopal where both sides had a queen rook and opposite coloured bishop. Vidit won a pawn after middle game exchanges and then nursed one of his connected passed pawns to victory.         
	Himanshu Sharma played the rook endgame like a book to thwart Viktor Laznicas attempts to squeeze out a draw from the ending. Sriram Jha drew against top seed Shakriyar Mamedyarov..         
	English Grandmaster Nigel Short overwhelmed Petr Kostenko by a brilliant sacrifice which opened up the position and gave him full point in 31 moves.         
	GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly outwitted IM R. R. Laxman in just 16 moves. Both were following the Anand-Picket game in a Petroff defence. Laxman was surprised when he differed on move 11 as Surya followed it up by a bishop sacrifice, which cost him the game.         
	Sandipan Chanda cruised through with a comfortable victory against IM S. Satyapragyan with black in a Sicilian defence.         
	B Adhiban held GM Aleksej Aleksandrov of Belarus to a draw to take his tally to 1.5 points.

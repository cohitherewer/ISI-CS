                                                   The CSA experiment
                      
	Johannesburg: A 40-over innings, 12-a-side team with all members eligible to bat, bowl or field and the Powerplays that have to be completed by the 35th over  these are some of the new formulae Cricket South Africa is applying, to inject more excitement into domestic format.         
	Cricket South Africa chief executive officer Gerald Majola Thursday announced the new format for the domestic circuit, replacing the MTN 45-over domestic franchise competition on a trial basis.         
	The new format, with all its innovations, is going to revolutionise this version of limited-over cricket in South Africa. CSA believes the new format will be a dynamic alternative to the dull periods that have crept into the 45-over version, by providing added excitement, Majola said.

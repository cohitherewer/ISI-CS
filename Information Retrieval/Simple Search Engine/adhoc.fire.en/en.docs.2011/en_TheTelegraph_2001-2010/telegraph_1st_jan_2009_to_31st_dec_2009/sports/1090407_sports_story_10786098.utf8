The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | An English club will win the Champions League: Alex
                                                   An English club will win the Champions League: Alex
                                  Alex Ferguson: United rsquo;s man for all seasons		    
	Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson believes it is an English club that will win this seasons Champions League. Going into the quarter final first-leg tie against FC Porto at Old Trafford on Tuesday, Uniteds man for all seasons talks about everything, from the teams workhorse Ryan Giggs to Inter counterpart Jose Mourinho, in a freewheeling interview with ESPNsoccernet.com.               
	Following are excerpts               
	Porto bring back memories of 2004  you were dominant, you had a goal struck off, but it just wasnt to be  theres a bit of a score to settle here, is there not?         
	Well, theres always a score to settle. Its just a reminder of how fragile the game of football can be. As you pointed out, we had a goal wrongly chopped off in the first half, we werent pleased with the performance of the referee in the game and they scored in injury time in a game which, as you said, we dominated. We were bitterly disappointed with that.         
	What have you observed doing your homework for the Porto match?         
	Ive been watching the videos the last couple of weeks and theyre very difficult to play against on their own ground  they have a terrific record there. It goes down to the first leg. Hopefully we can get a two-goal lead. If we get a two-goal lead it gives us the best opportunity without question.         
	Youve spoken about Barcelona as being the biggest threat potentially in the Champions League, what is that you see about this particular Barcelona side that catches the eye?         
	Well, I think theyre the biggest threat to the English clubs. I do think that an English club will win it again this year, but Barcelonas form has been fantastic this year and theyve got goals in their team. Thats the real answer to that in (Samuel) Eto and (Lionel) Messi and (Thierry) Henry. They have a goal-scoring operation, which does very well.         
	Youve placed the emphasis again on the Champions League this season, but how hard is it to win the competition in back-to-back years? The last team to do it was AC Milan, in the old European Cup format, way back in 89 amp; 90         
	Well, that tells you everything I suppose. Hopefully we can defend it, wed be the first to do it in the Champions League and, to be fair to our club, we are good at doing firsts. Hopefully this is going to be another first, to defend a title, which no one has done.         
	A word on Ryan Giggs  hes having one of his best-ever seasons, maybe against the odds when you consider the age factor, but has it surprised you just what he has delivered this term?         
	Its not surprising, knowing the boy for a long time. Weve always remarked about him that hes conducted his life very well, hes always looked after himself, hes a naturally fit and athletic boy and hes one of these lads with a terrifically cold temperament to the game, nothing fazes him. So, these things help towards longevity in the game and what I think were seeing now is Ryan Giggs at his very peak. I dont think were seeinghow would you put it that gradual trailing off that players do in their 30s as I experienced myself as a player. With Ryan we dont see that at all.         
	You think he can go on and on and on?         
	I think he can play for another two or three years.         
	Dimitar Berbatov is in his first season with United and hes been a key figure for you. Hes featured in many of your selections, but some of the United supporters are saying: Hes not busy enough. What is it about Berbatov specifically that you like?         
	I can understand them saying that because hes a very economic player, hes like Teddy Sheringham in that way. Teddy was exactly the same. He drifts in to spaces, his movement is off the ball, but when you actually do the stats hes as high as anyone in the team. Plus, I think hes got 14-15 goals this season, hes made about 14-15 goals  theres a Cantona link to that.         
	When you look at Inter Milan manager Jose Mourinho, do you see a lot of similarities with, maybe, a younger Alex Ferguson?         
	I can see in Jose some qualities that I hope I had in terms of. being very bullish, very confident. Hes very bullish and very confident in his abilities and theres nothing wrong with that but you have to deliver and in most cases he has delivered. And Ive always found him really good company. I think one of his great attributes is he can laugh at himself and he never fails to show up after the game no matter what the result which, I think, is a good quality. And he came in after the game against Inter Milan. It was very good  he accepted defeat with great dignity.         
	Is the EPL missing Mourinhos personality?         
	Yeah, I think so. I think the game has missed him, theres no doubt about that. I think he was fantastic for the press, the press loved that, but Chelsea also were a very strong team.         
	Will you be in Rome on May 27?         
	Lets hope so.

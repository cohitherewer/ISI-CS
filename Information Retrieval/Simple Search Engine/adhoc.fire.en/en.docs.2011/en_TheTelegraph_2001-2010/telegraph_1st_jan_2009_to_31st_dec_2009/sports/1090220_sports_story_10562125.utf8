The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rohan in Davis Cup squad
                                                   Rohan in Davis Cup squad
                      
	New Delhi: Rohan Bopanna Thursday replaced Prakash Amritraj in the Indian Davis Cup team for the Asia/Oceania Group I tie against Chinese Taipei as the selectors picked a five-member squad here.         
	Leander Paes, Mahesh Bhupathi, Somdev Dev Varman and Sanam Singh, as a reserve player, are other members of the squad for the away tie, to be played from March 6.         
	Amritraj, who took part in the play-off tie against Romania, has been left out as he was rendered ineligible for selection after the new sports policy came into effect. According to the new policy, only Indian citizens are allowed to represent the country. Amritraj holds a US passport and hence, has become ineligible for selection.         
	Bopanna, who has been doing well in doubles in the recent past on the ATP circuit, was not part of the team for the Romania tie. S.P. Misra will continue as non-playing captain, an AITA press release said.         
	The All India Tennis Association selection committee, led by chairman Anil Dhupar, chose the team. The other members of the committee are Misra (cochairman), Akhtar Ali, Balram Singh and Rohit Rajpal.

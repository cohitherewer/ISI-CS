The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev slips to tied 26th
                                                   Jeev slips to tied 26th
                      
	Hilton Head (US): Jeev Milkha Singh brought home his second level-par card of the week to slip to tied 26th after the penultimate round of the Verizon Heritage golf tournament here. Overnight tied 21st, Jeev returned 71 to take his three-day tally to two-under 211 and join 14 others at the 26th place.         
	Jeev parred his first two holes before he bogeyed the third but his ninth hole birdie had him level-par at the turn.         
	On his way back, Jeev again was pushed to the back foot after the 11th hole bogey but he birdied the next and then parred the next to sign off with a level-par card.         
	Overnight leader Brian Gay (200) fired 67 to open up a three-stroke lead over Tim Wilkinson, who shot 65. Gay is a round away from his second career victory after winning the 2008 Mayakoba Golf Classic in Mexico, when most of the golf world was watching the bigger names at the World Golf Championships Match Play event.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IFA rushes in new referee
                                                   IFA rushes in new referee
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan, in the latest turn in the Edeh Chidi-red card drama, have warned the Indian Football Association (IFA) of not playing the Shield final if the state governing body didnt take any action against match officials .P. Thakur and A. Arjunan.         
	The duo had issued marching orders to Chidi in Wednesdays semi-final against Chirag United.         
	Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra has written to the IFA to look into the incident again and reconsider whether action shouldnt be taken against the erring match officials. Bagan feel it was unfair that only Chidi should have picked up a red card, for headbutting Eduardo when the Chirag defender too was at fault for starting the altercation.         
	Bagan will decide on their course of action depending on the IFAs reply. The IFA said that the appointment of referees was the sole discretion of the AIFF and they had no role to play.         
	However, according to sources, Bagans veiled threat has put the IFA in a spot of bother. The AIFF, upon receiving a request, went to the extent of calling up the Nepal Football Association but to no avail. It was learnt that Gujarats Dinesh Nayar, who was bound for New Delhi en route to Jamshedpur, has been asked to rush to Calcutta to officiate in Saturdays final.         
	While Bagan fretted over Chidis non-availability for the final, Churchill Brothers were leaving no stone unturned for a successful end to their Calcutta sojourn. The visitors will have the services of Okolie Odafa, who had missed the semis with a double booking.         
	Having Odafa is obviously an advantage for any club. He is a key player But we will be up against a good team and, more importantly, on their home ground, coach Carlos Pereira said.         
	Meanwhile, Bagan have ridiculed Bhaichung Bhutias defamation charge against the club saying the India captain has become a laughing stock.         
	Why has he claimed compensation for Rs 1 crore only? It should have been Rs 20 crore Hes been misguided by some people from the first day of this episode, Mitra alleged.

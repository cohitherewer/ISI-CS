	Karachi: Former Pakistan captain and pace legend Wasim Akram Thursday broke down in front of an inquiry committee, probing into the allegations that his wife Huma died due to medical negligence.         
	Akram after meeting the committee members, consisting of federal health ministry officials, said that he is appalled by the way the medical professionals carry out their duties in some hospitals of the country.         
	My wife died because she was not provided proper medical care and as a result, her kidneys failed and she suffered heart complications, Akram said.         
	He also demanded the government to intervene and to take concrete steps to check the malicious activities of these private hospitals, where people were not being provided with due medical care and being fleeced.         
	The committee members, meanwhile, after the meeting, have sent their recommendations to the government to cancel the licenses of around 17 doctors and para-medical staff at one of the private hospitals under scrutiny.         
	The provincial health minister later confirmed to media that he had issued orders for the cancellation of licenses of the doctors.         
	Akram had carried out a vociferous campaign seeking action against the doctors and support staff of the two private hospitals where his wife remained under-treatment before she expired in a Chennai hospital on October 25th.         
	Not satisfied with the treatment being meted out to his wife in Lahore, Akram had flown his wife to Singapore on an air ambulance for further treatment.

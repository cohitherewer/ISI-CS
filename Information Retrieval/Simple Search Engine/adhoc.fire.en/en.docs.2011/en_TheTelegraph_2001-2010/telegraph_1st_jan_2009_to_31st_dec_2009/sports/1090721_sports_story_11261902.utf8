The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A dream come true   for Andrew Strauss
                                                   A dream come true   for Andrew Strauss
                            
	London: Andrew Strauss was all praise for Andrew Flintoff after Englands victory over Australia at Lords on Monday.         
	Strauss, whose first innings 161 helped give England a solid base on which to build, said: I just want to give a special mention to Andrew Flintoff, who was magnificent this morning.         
	To win an Ashes Test at Lords is something many guys have dreamt of doing over the last 50 or 60 years or so and to be the guys who pulled it off is pretty special.         
	Off-spinner Graeme Swann provided excellent support to Flintoff with a return for four for 87.         
	Its unbelievable, said Swann. Everybody was a little bit nervous and apprehensive this morning. Fred (Flintoff) getting that wicket (of Haddin) calmed everyone down.         
	Swann, who bowled Clarke with his second delivery on the final day, added: He held them together. I think to get him out was probably the key wicket. So Ill take all the glory.         
	Australia captain Ricky Ponting, who in 2006-07 led Australia to a 5-0 Ashes whitewash of a team captained by Flintoff, had no complaints.         
	England have been the better side from the first ball  and not only in the big moments, he said.         
	Pontings men were on the wrong end of several questionable umpiring decisions during the game but he said: They are all irrelevant now. At the end of the day weve been beaten by more than 100 runs in a Test match. We cant change anything that happened.

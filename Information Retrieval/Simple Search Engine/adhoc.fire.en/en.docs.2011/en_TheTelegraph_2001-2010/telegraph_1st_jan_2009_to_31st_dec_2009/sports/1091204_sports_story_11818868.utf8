The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Blackburn get past the Blues
                                                                                                                       7                                      Blackburn get past the Blues
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                      
	For Blackburn Rovers, the ecstasy; for Chelsea, the agony. Well, not quite. The shoot-out in which Carlo Ancelotti had to digest his first exit from an English competition was painful, as Paul Robinsons decisive block from Gael Kakutas penalty propelled Blackburn to a Carling Cup semi-final, but you have to wonder if the Italian truly cared.         
	Blackburn dumped a 10-man Chelsea 4-3 on penalties on Wednesday after a quarter final thriller ended 3-3 following extra time at Ewood Park.         
	In a roller-coaster match that saw the Premier League leaders twice fall behind only to grab a dramatic 122nd-minute equaliser, it was left to teenager Kakuta to fluff the decisive penalty kick.         
	Manchester City beat a young Arsenal team 3-0 in the nights other quarter final to set up a mouth-watering clash with holders and local rivals Manchester United in the last four. Rovers play Aston Villa.         
	Ancelotti did not exactly do a disservice to the Carling Cup, in that he eventually chose to play the man of the hour, Didier Drogba, but he did not seem too bothered that Robinsons inspiration had put them out of it, either.         
	It was Ancelottis choice to send such a weakened team to Lancashire, a move that necessitated three changes at half-time, just as it was his choice for Kakuta to take the ill-fated fifth penalty.         
	City, after going into the break at 0-0, stamped their authority on Arsenal with second-half goals from Carlos Tevez, Shaun Wright-Phillips and Vladimir Weiss.

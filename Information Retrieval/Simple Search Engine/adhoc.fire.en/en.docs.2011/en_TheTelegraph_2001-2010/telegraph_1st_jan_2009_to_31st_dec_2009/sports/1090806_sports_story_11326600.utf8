	London: The Dewsbury Young Stars cricket team has the opening pair of Patel and Patel, followed by Patel and eight more Patels coming down the batting order.         
	It was an all-Patel team coming out for the DYS last week and not only the players but also the scorers and the club secretary were Patels!         
	The openers are Patel and Patel, followed by Patel, Patel, Patel, Patel, Patel, Patel, Patel, Patel and Patel. And the names of both their scorers? Youve guessed it  Patel, reported an English daily.         
	The team, aged from 18 to mid-30s, play in West Yorkshires Dewsbury District League Section B. Yunus Patel, who plays for the Young Stars, is also the club secretary. As if only to add to the long list, the Warwicks also had fielded three Patels in their team that day.

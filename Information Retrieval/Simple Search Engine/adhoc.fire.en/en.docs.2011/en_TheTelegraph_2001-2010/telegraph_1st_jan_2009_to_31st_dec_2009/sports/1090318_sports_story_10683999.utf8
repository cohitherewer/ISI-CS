The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Seniors are the real assets, says Dhoni
                                                     Seniors are the real assets, says Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT            Mahendra Singh Dhoni                           
	Hamilton: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Tuesday described the senior cricketers in the team as real assets and said they are of immense help to the youngsters.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On the wicket for the match         
	Looks like a good wicket, definitely there will be a bit of help for the seamers. More than the wicket, the conditions will favour the bowlers and the ball will move. The base also looks quite hard.         
	How important will be the toss?         
	Depends on the wicket. If the wicket is a bit damp, and its a bit cloudy, then you want to win the toss. But more often than not, if its a good batting track, nothing changes much, especially outside the subcontinent, where the wicket doesnt undergo much wear and tear.         
	If India would prefer to bat first         
	Thats what we do, but a lot depends on the conditions before the toss. Over here weather changes in 15-20 minutes, and all of a sudden from being sunny it becomes cloudy. But yeah we prefer batting.         
	How important is experience         
	Experience does count especially when it comes to the longer format. If you are a batsman, you can read what the bowlers plan is and you have time to change your game. In the same way, if you have experienced bowlers, they actually guide the youngsters and ultimately the potential of your bowling attack or batting rises a lot.         
	But at the end of they day you have to adapt, whether you are a youngster or senior, its on you to perform. One can have plenty of talk with seniors, but ultimately you are the one who has to do it.         
	If India will be boosted by the return of the seniors         
	Of course. They have been playing cricket for quite some time. They have performed wherever they have played. They are the real assets. Not only from a batting point of view, they provide a fair amount of input when it comes to bowling. It helps you as a skipper, when you look around and see guys with experience of at least 75 Test matches and some with over 100 Tests. If you are having tough time, you can go to any of them and they will sort a problem out for you. Its a big asset to have in the side.         
	Virender Sehwags batting         
	He plays the way he wants to play, because thats his natural style. We all know if he gets going, he can dominate the bowlers and all of a sudden you see the bowling attack rattled. We have seen if he plays for two or three hours, he is a batsman who is capable of getting big scores. He is not the kind who gets out in the 30s or 40s or 50s or 60s. If he gets going, he gets big scores. We dont want individuals to change their game. Thats the strength because of which they are part of the Indian team.         
	Ishant Sharmas form         
	You know he is a much better bowler than what he did in the one-dayers. More often he bowled one-change, and wickets were quite placid. We had big scores, and most of the times New Zealand got off to a good start and the batsmen basically targeted the third seamer. Its always tough to judge on the basis of one-dayers.         
	The late start of the Test match         
	It will be very different for us. It will be like playing at night. Play will go on till dont know what time. That will be definitely difficult. I have not played any Test that starts at 12 noon. The people in the team who get up late will relish it. They can sleep for one more hour.         
	Indias dismal performance in the last series         
	Not talking about what has happened in the past. Thats one thing beyond our control. We are just focusing on the process, and what we need to do as a team. We are not thinking about the result. We are not thinking too much about the conditions. We need to put our 100 per cent We want to prepare ourselves, and execute our plans well.         
	The team that comes out winners is one that executes those plans. It will be important to play consistent cricket over a period of time, not just one day or two day, but five days. Especially the fourth and fifth day, every session is crucial. Match changes with every session.         
	If India are relying on any individuals performance         
	We dont rely on individuals, thats one thing. If you see our record in the past one and a half-year, we dont rely only on batsmen. Bowlers on flat tracks have come out with plenty of aggression. They bowl the right line, they have got the best batsmen out because of their consistency and their plans and the execution. Thats what is important. We dont rely on just the batsmen or the bowlers, we have been good as a team.         
	On the New Zealand team         
	Its an interesting line-up. They lost the one-day series but that doesnt mean they are not a good side. They are a very competitive side, especially when it comes to exploiting the home conditions. Definitely they are a good side, and we expect tough cricket over the next 20-25 days.         
	If the Indian pacers performance is going to be important         
	I think the whole bowling attack needs to be good. We are looking for a 3-1 combination. Each and every individual is important. Its not only about the new ball. Most important thing is how the bowler is bowling from the 20th over onwards, when the initial glaze off the ball is gone         
	A third seamer comes into action when there is not much help for the bowler and that extra effort from all the three seamers is needed.         
	One good thing is that the weather will be nice, so they can run in all day. At the same time there will be wind, and somebody will have to bowl into the wind. So each and every individual is important, including part-timers.         
	How important is this Test series for India         
	Every series is important. Its not about whether we are playing in India or New Zealand. Whatever international game we play is important. Not only for me, but the whole team. Its important for all of us. Its as important as any other series.

                                                     TN ride Mukund century
                  Abhinav Mukund                     
	Nagpur: Abhinav Mukund feasted on Uttar Pradeshs pedestrian attack and slammed his fourth century of the season as Tamil Nadu cruised to 296 for two wickets on the opening day of their Ranji Trophy semi-final match here on Sunday.         
	Dinesh Karthiks decision to bat first stood vindicated as Mukund (100) and Murali Vijay (69) added 167 runs for the opening stand before both fell in a span of seven overs.         
	S. Badrinath (59) and Karthik (58) continued the good work and remained unbeaten at stumps, having added 114 runs for the unbroken third wicket stand.         
	India international Rudra Pratap Singhs absence due to a shoulder injury was thoroughly felt as UPs new ball colleagues Praveen Kumar and Bhuvneswar Kumar managed to contain but could not make any inroads into the Tamil Nadu line-up.         
	Once they got their eyes in, Mukund and Vijay, who featured in a 462-run stand against Maharashtra in the first match of the season, were in complete control of the proceedings as UP bowlers toiled without success.         
	Mukund has been in stellar form this season, averaging 84, and the left-hander continued his purple patch against UPs toothless attack.         
	Vijay was equally confident as he drove and cut with elan. The left-right combination went on to add 167 runs before medium pacer Parvinder Singh drew first blood when he had Vijay caught by Praveen Kumar in the 51st over.         
	Brief scores: Tamil Nadu 296/2 (A Mukund 100) vs UP. Match to continue. (PTI)

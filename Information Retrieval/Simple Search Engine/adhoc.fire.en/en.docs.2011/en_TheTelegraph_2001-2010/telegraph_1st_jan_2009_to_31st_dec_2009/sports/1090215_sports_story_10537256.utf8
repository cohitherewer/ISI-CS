                      Yusif Yakubu (top) and Sunil Chetri                       
	Margao: A brace each from Sunil Chetri and Yusif Yakubu helped East Bengal score a resounding 4-1 victory over a fighting Vasco in the 15th round of the ONGC I-League at the Nehru Stadium here on Saturday.         
	East Bengal, which led 1-0 at half time, scored through Sunil (29th, 89th) and Man of the Match Yusif Yakubu (46th, 55th). Vasco pulled one back through Sherzod Nazarov (54th).         
	Both teams started on a cautious note but East Bengal gradually took control of the proceedings. They increased the pace with long passes, putting the rival defence under pressure.         
	Yakubu sounded the first warning when his early attempt at the goal hit the post.         
	The Vasco defence, particularly Covan Lawerence, warded off the moves but the defence finally faltered in the 29th minute when a move from the right saw Yakubu taking a pot shot at the goal which keeper Laxmikant Kattimani managed to block. The deflection went to Sunil, who slammed the ball into the net to put East Bengal in the lead.         
	Yakubu increased the lead a minute after the lemon break, when he tapped home a well-directed lob from a flag kick taken by Rennedy Singh. Goalkeeper Kattimani misjudged the flight of the ball on this occasion.         
	Vasco reduced the margin in the 54th minute. Substitute Joy Ferrao put Sherzod Nazarov through with a back-header. Nazarov took two rival defenders in his stride and placed the ball into the net past custodian Abhra Mondal.         
	Yukubu struck again a minute later when he headed home a well-directed cross off Rennedy.         
	Vasco tried hard to come back into the match towards the end but it was a bit too late as Sunil scored his second, one minute before the final whistle, guiding home a cross from substitute Alvito D Cunha.         
	The win took East Bengals tally to 19 points from 15 matches while Vasco remained at the bottom of the table with 10 points.         
	Referee Pratap Singh showed yellow cards to Vascos Ferrao, Nazarov and East Bengals Ismael Addo.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Whitewash possible, says White
                                                   Whitewash possible, says White
                      
	Southampton: Aussie all-rounder Cameron White believes Australia can finish their England tour with a flourish by trouncing England 7-0 in the ongoing one-day international (ODI) series.         
	Whites century at the Rose Bowl here Wednesday helped the world champions to a six-wicket win, earning them a 3-0 lead. Victory at Lords Saturday will give Australia the series.         
	At the moment, if we keep playing good, consistent cricket, keep bowling and fielding well, there is no reason why not, White said, asked about the possibility of a clean sweep.         
	England have decided to rest Paul Collingwood and James Anderson for the next three and two matches\ respectively. Durham batsman Collingwood and Lancashire pacer Anderson have not missed an England fixture since early February and will finally get a chance to rest their weary limbs.         
	Although England need a victory Saturday to stay alive, it was decided that the strain of a heavy schedule in the aftermath of the Ashes triumph has taken its toll on the duo.         
	Collingwood will return for the last match, while Anderson will rejoin the squad before the second of back-to-back day-nighters at Trent Bridge. (AFP)

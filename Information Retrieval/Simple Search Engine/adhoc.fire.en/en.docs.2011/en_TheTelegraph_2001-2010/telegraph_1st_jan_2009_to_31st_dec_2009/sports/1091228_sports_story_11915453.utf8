The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | For Clijsters, court not everything
                                                                                                                       7                                        For Clijsters, court not everything

	When Kim Clijsters came out of retirement and won the US Open, it was one small step for motherhood and one giant leap for womens tennis.         
	The Womens Tennis Association has been a misnomer, the World Tennis Adolescents probably a more apt name for a tour teeming with teenagers who come with baggage not confined to their racket bags and suitcases.         
	Clijsters was 14 when she turned professional, the same age as Andrea Jaeger, one of many prodigies who left tennis by the time they left their teens. Clijsters was 23 when the grind of the tour turned her passion to dust. She was emotionally and physically spent from having her life tethered to tennis.         
	This is how the storybook careers of so many female athletes used to end, with a desire for marriage and motherhood driving them out of the competitive arena. The script is slowly but surely being rewritten by the likes of Dara Torres, who won three silver medals in swimming at the 2008 Olympics as a 41-year-old mother; and the WNBA player Candace Parker, who returned to the court this summer, weeks after giving birth to a daughter.         
	The perspective that comes with maturity and motherhood can be performance-enhancing, as Clijsters, 26, discovered when she resumed training at the start of 2009, not quite a year after she and her husband, Brian Lynch, welcomed their daughter, Jada, into the world.         
	Throughout the two weeks of the Open, Clijsters described herself as a more complete person.         
	She spoke of the joys of being able to leave tennis behind at the end of the day and be a wife and a mother. Her contentment was in sharp contrast to the misery of top-seeded Dinara Safina and Ana Ivanovic, a former No.1, two 20-somethings who sounded in sore need of a life outside tennis.         
	In a weird way, Clijsters had to become a multitasking mother to find her peace of mind. She spoke of being able to handle her emotions better during matches, of having a lot more understanding of myself.         
	The criticism of Clijsters in her younger days was that her nerves got the best of her in big matches. She showed a steely resolve in defeating Venus Williams and Serena Williams on her way to the Open final.         
	Her straight-sets victory in the semi-finals sent a more forceful message than Serena Williams did in her tirade against a lineswoman before match point.         
	With her 7-5, 6-3 victory over 19-year-old Caroline Wozniacki in the final, Clijsters put the mom in momentous.           NYT NEWS SERVICE

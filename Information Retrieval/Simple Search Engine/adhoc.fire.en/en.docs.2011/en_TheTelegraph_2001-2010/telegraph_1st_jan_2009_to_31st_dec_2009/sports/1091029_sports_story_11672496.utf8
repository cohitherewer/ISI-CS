The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fernando Alonso gears up for an emotional exit
                                                     Fernando Alonso gears up for an emotional exit
  - Spaniard says hed love to finish Renault career with a great result       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Fernando Alonso                                 
	Fernando Alonso is readying himself for an emotional farewell to Renault this weekend as he races his last Grand Prix with the team ahead of his big-money move to Ferrari, ending a two-year association.         
	It is the second time the Spaniard will be saying his goodbyes as he faced a similar situation in 2006 after winning back-to-back world titles with Renault prior to his ill-fated move to McLaren.         
	Ahead of the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Alonso said: I would love to finish the season and my Renault career with a great result.         
	It will be an emotional race because I have enjoyed so many special memories with this team, and I am leaving behind a lot of friends.         
	Renault is one of the great teams in Formula One, and I look forward to fighting with them on the track in the years ahead.         
	Paying tribute to Alonso, team principal Bob Bell remarked: Hes made a huge contribution to the team, especially winning two world championships in 2005 and 2006 so he will be missed enormously.         
	Its often said he is the best driver on the grid, and I wouldnt disagree with that, so were understandably sad to see the end of our very successful relationship.         
	But were also looking forward and were all delighted to be welcoming Robert Kubica to the team as I believe he will quickly show that he is of the same calibre as Fernando.         
	Hes a strong team player, a great motivator and incredibly quick, so we have plenty to look forward to as we enter a new era for the team.         
	Looking forward is the best Renault can do really. This season hasnt been kind to the French carmakers. The Oxfordshire-based teams only podium, so far, came at the night race in Singapore  Alonso finishing third behind McLarens Lewis Hamilton and Toyotas Timo Glock.         
	But the Nelson Piquet Jr Crashgate scandal has ensured that Singapore will stay alive in the teams memory for all the wrong reasons, indeed as one of the darkest chapters in an otherwise illustrious racing history.         
	The guard, though, has changed with Flavio Briatore, the team principal at the 2008 Singapore GP, getting the axe for the part he played in the entire affair. Piquet Jr had been replaced with Romain Grosjean but has had a run of indifferent results.         
	With the highly-rated Kubica coming in for the next season, Renault will be hoping to put the ghost of Singapore 2008 to rest and turn their attention to the track..

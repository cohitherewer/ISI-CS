The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rai still on top
                                                   Rai still on top
                      
	Johor Bahru: Himmat Rai sits uneasily at the top of the heap with just one-shot lead after some strong efforts by his rivals at the weather-hit $1 million Iskandar Johor Open Saturday.         
	Rai had finished his second round Friday with his two-day total of 13-under-par 131 at the Royal Johor Country Club, and he will be making a title assault Sunday.         
	The Asian Tour event heads into the third and final round Sunday after inclement weather forced officials to reduce the event to a 54-hole stroke play tournament.         
	Asian Tour honorary member KJ Choi of Korea and Australias Darren Beck held on to their tied second positions on 132 while Chinese Taipeis Chang Tse-peng is also among the mix in fourth position on 133.         
	However, eight Indians missed the cut, which came at two-under. The best-placed Indian after Rai was Rahil Gangjee (67) as he moved up to tied eighth at eight-under 136 for two rounds.         
	Anirban Lahiri shot a 69 and was tied 14th at six-under. Also tied 14th at six under was Gaganjeet Bhullar (69).         
	Ashok Kumar and SSP Chowrasia were tied 22nd at five-under, Jyoti Randhawa was tied 30th at four-under, C. Muniyappa was tied 42nd at three-under and Digvijay Singh was tied 53rd at two-under which was the cut line.         
	Defending champion Retief Goosen of South Africa failed to make an impact and conceded that he was out of the title race after shooting a second round 70 to lie in tied 22nd on 139.

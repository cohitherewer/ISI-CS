The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England look down the barrel
                                                     England look down the barrel
            Scyld Berry            Australias Marcus North dives for the line to score his 100th run on Day IV of the first Test in Cardiff on Saturday. (AP)                           
	Cardiff: It has not worked as a home Test for Englands players so far. But all will be forgiven if Welsh rain enables England  wounded in mind and body  to survive the final day and escape from Cardiff with a draw.         
	The Australians, tough of mind and body, have made the most of their abilities. England have collectively under-performed.         
	England have to clear their heads, starting with Andrew Strauss and Kevin Pietersen.         
	England have to bat well beyond tea time as it will only be around then that they will clear off the remaining arrears of 219.         
	If there is no Welsh rain and 98 overs are bowled, the Australian pace attack will have a second new ball for re-armament, and their assortment of spinners will test Englands patience: a virtue lacking in the home sides first innings when too many batsmen, like persistent atheists, failed to convert.         
	Marcus North, benefiting from his time inside the Trojan Horse, became the 15th Australian to score a century in his first Ashes Test, and England may not have heard the last of him.         
	Norths off-spinners, from a high arm, bounce more than those of Nathan Hauritz, although as a part-timer North bowls more than his share of full tosses.         
	Into this terrible hole England have slowly, almost imperceptibly, dug themselves. Firstly their batting started off on the wrong foot when Alastair Cook offered the first soft dismissal of the game.         
	Then Englands bowling set off badly when Stuart Broad offered width to Phil Hughes, whose innings was small but initiative-seizing, allowing Katich to bed down as the first of Australias four century-makers. Starts are not always everything, but they were here.         
	Andrew Flintoff was the most threatening seamer, as usual, but had very little to show in the wickets column, as so often the case in the last few years when he has played.         
	North, when he cover-drives, follows through with a distinctive flourish and a hint of Sourav Ganguly. In defence he is relentlessly methodical  or rather he is when he has a big innings behind him, such as his 191 in the Worcester warm-up.         
	He has now scored two hundreds in his three Tests, which makes him sound very inexperienced, but he has played for five first-class counties in England.         
	Brad Haddin inflicted a first of some indignity when he added his own century: never before had England conceded four individual hundreds in an innings to any country.         
	Softened up, footsore and 239 runs behind, England had half-an-hour to last until tea and the likely close of play as rain was imminent. Cook is still not into this series. He fell over to the offside and was pinned by the first left-arm pace bowler he has seen in Test cricket in 2009: such are the bad habits that can come from playing the same opponents for half a year.         
	His Essex teammate Ravi Bopara was unlucky in that the ball hit him above the knee-roll and Billy Doctrove suddenly switched from being a confirmed not-outer yet the stroke was too ambitious, considering the ball was straight and new, tea and the close were near at hand, and the situation dire.

                                                   Last years laggards make an explosive turnaround
                      
	Centurion: A blistering 85 from skipper Adam Gilchrist propelled the last editions bottom-ranked Deccan Chargers into the final of the Indian Premier League following their six-wicket win over the Delhi DareDevils in the first semi-final here on Friday.         
	Gilchrist hammered 10 fours and five sixes during his 35-ball knock that single-handedly turned the semi-final into a no contest after the DareDevils, invited to bat, rode on Tillekaratne Dilshans half-century to post a fighting 153 for eight.         
	The Australian wicketkeeper seemed to be in a hurry to finish off the match. He was in a murderous mood, hitting Dirk Nannes for five consecutive boundaries in the very first over and then welcoming Pradeep Sangwan with back to back fours and a huge six over mid-wicket.         
	Gilchrist had looked like a man with a plan when, at the toss, he said the Chargers would field and try and keep the opposition to an achievable target. With teams not always chasing down totals in the vicinity of 160 easily under lights at Centurion, Deccans chase wasnt expected to be an easy one.         
	Herschelle Gibbss (0) dismissal had very little effect on him as he brought his 50 off just 17 deliveries, the fastest in the IPL so far, and fifth quickest in Twenty20 cricket.         
	His innings was finally brought to an end by Amit Mishra after Gilchrist attempted another big one but held out to Nannes at short third-man.         
	And if Delhi thought getting rid of Gilchrist was the end of all their troubles, they were in for shock as Andrew Symonds (24 off 15 balls) walked in and clobbered Nannes for two successive boundaries.         
	Tirumalsetti Suman (unbeaten 24) too joined the party and picked up a couple of fours and by the time Symonds fell to Mishra (three for 19), the Deccan Chargers were well into the final, which they did with 14 balls to spare.         
	Earlier, Sri Lankan Dilshan survived two dropped catches and a run out attempt to score 65 off 51 balls and alongwith captain Virender Sehwag (39) and AB de Villiers (26), helped the DareDevils recover from a terrible start that saw Ryan Harris send openers Gautam Gambhir and David Warner back to the pavilion without a run on the board.         
	It brought Sehwag and Dilshan together. The duo drove, cut and pulled with effortless ease and at the half-way stage, Delhi had raced to 83 for the loss of two wickets.         
	A scoreline of zero for two had little bearing on Dilshan. He led a charmed life, pulling his first ball just over deep backward square legs fingertips for six and edging the second between gully and slip for four. Then Sehwag nearly ran him out next ball when he punched the ball to mid-wicket and then changed his mind.         
	While Sehwag got tall to work the ball to the leg side, Dilshan preferred to back away and squeeze it through backward point and third man. He used the uncomplicated strategy of judging the length early and then slapping it either off the back foot or front. Gilchrist was given a tough time in setting a field for Dilshan, who was adept at picking runs anywhere in the park.         
	However, the first over after the break accounted for Sehwag. Symonds trapped the Delhi skipper in front of the wicket for 39. His 31-ball knock included five hits to the fence.         
	Sehwags departure put the breaks on Delhi and despite De Villiers 26 off 21 balls, the total seemed a bit short.         
	In the final over, the DareDevils lost three wickets. Rajat Bhatia was caught by Venugopal Rao off Singh for four, then Dilshan and Amit Mishra were run out by Gilchrist in the last two balls of the innings.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Odafe eyes Fed Cup
                                                   Odafe eyes Fed Cup
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Wiping off beads of sweat from his forehead, Okolie Odafe was asking for a bottle of water. There were still some confettis on his closely cropped hair and the forearm. Want to talk? he asked the reporters, soaking in every bit of attention he was getting.         
	Its not me alone who brought this title. Its teamwork. Everyone from the coach to the players played their part in this victory, Odafe said.         
	Indian footballs most prolific striker in recent times, Odafe has won everything with Churchill. From the I-League to the Durand Cup and now the IFA Shield. Fed Cup is still missing. And we will win this time, he promised with a touch of arrogance.         
	Indias most expensive striker  Churchill shelled out a whopping Rs 1.10 crore to retain this most-sought after man  is also targeting the AFC Cup. Yeah, we can play against quality opposition. AFC Cup will be tough but we are ready for it.         
	Odafes next stop is the Durand Cup and Churchill, as usual, are one of the favourites. We should win that too, he said. Well if he continues to fire, is there anybody who can stop this Churchill team?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahesh, Mark fall in final
                                                   Mahesh, Mark fall in final
                      
	Melbourne: Teen sensation Yuki Bhambris historic junior singles title lit up the day for India at the Australian Open before Mahesh Bhupathis loss in the mens doubles final rounded it off on a disappointing note here on Saturday.         
	Bhupathis seven-year Grand Slam title drought in mens doubles continued after the Indian and his Bahamian partner Mark Knowles squandered a one-set lead to go down to Americans Bob and Mike Bryan 6-2, 5-7, 0-6.         
	The Indo-Bahamian pair made a resounding start to the proceedings breaking the Americans in the opening game to race to a 3-1 lead.         
	Bhupathi and Knowles broke the Bryans once again in the fifth game to wrap up the opener in just 27 minutes.         
	However, it all went downhill for them thereafter as the Bryans roared back into the match.         
	The second set went on serve and both the teams frittered away a break point each before the Americans edged past their opponents.         
	Bob and Mike earned a couple of break points in the 12th game and this time they made no mistake, converting the chance to make it 1-1.         
	The third set completely belonged to the second seeds and they were simply unstoppable, breaking the Indo-Bahamian pair thrice to seal the match.         
	Bhupathis mens doubles hopes may be over but he is still in contention for a title at the seasons first Grand Slam as he has also reached the mixed doubles final teaming up with Sania Mirza.         
	The duo takes on French Nathalie Dechy and Israels Andy Ram in the final on Sunday.         
	Bhupathi last won a mens doubles Grand Slam title in 2002 when he teamed up with Max Mirnyi to lift the US Open.         
	He has never won the Australian Open mens doubles title and his other three Grand Slam titles have come at the 1999 French Open and Wimbledon and the 2001 French Open.         
	All three of these titles came with his now-estranged partner Leander Paes.         
	For the Bryans, Saturdays triumph gave them their seventh overall and the third Australian Open Grand Slam title.

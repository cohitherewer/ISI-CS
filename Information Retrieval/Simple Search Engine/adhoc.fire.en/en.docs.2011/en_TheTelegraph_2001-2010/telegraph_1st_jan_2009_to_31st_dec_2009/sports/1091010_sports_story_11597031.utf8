    - Cup qualifiers France, POrtugal in must-win matches                   Cristiano Ronaldo during a training session in Lisbon on Friday. (AP)                           
	Milan: Confident Serbia will qualify for the 2010 World Cup and consign 2006 runners-up France to a probable playoff berth if they beat Romania on Saturday, the penultimate round of qualification matches for most European nations.         
	France are not even guaranteed a November playoff spot with Austria four points behind but they should be able to seal one with a home victory over the Faroe Islands, even without the injured Franck Ribery.         
	Three points in the Scandinavian derby will send Denmark to South Africa while victory for Sweden will mean Portugal and Cristiano Ronaldo will be watching next Junes showpiece at home if they fail to beat Hungary.         
	Group Eight leaders Italy need a point against second-placed Ireland, coached by former Azzurri boss Giovanni Trapattoni, with Switzerland and Slovakia also able to secure their passage.         
	Serbia, who top Group Seven with 19 points from eight matches, require one win from their final two qualifiers at home to Romania on Saturday or away to Lithuania four days later.         
	Germany are a point above Russia in Group Four and want a win to join already-qualified Spain, England and the Netherlands at Africas first finals.         
	Russia have secured a playoff spot and must beat the Germans and Azerbaijan on Wednesday to go through .         
	The task is easier for Group Three leaders Slovakia, who need a point at home to second-placed Slovenia to reach their first ever tournament as an independent nation.         
	The permutations are more complicated in Groups One and Two.         
	The Danes will make up for not reaching the last World Cup or Euro 2008 if they beat Zlatan Ibrahimovics Sweden in Copenhagen, a result that would be equally celebrated in Lisbon.         
	Third-placed Portugal, two points behind the Swedes, cannot afford to lose at home to Hungary and at least should have Ronaldo fit after an ankle injury.         
	Only the best eight second-placed teams make Novembers home and away fixtures.         
	Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro will meet up with his teammates as expected on Sunday and the issue of his failed drugs test has already been resolved, Lippi said Friday.         
	The Juventus defender received emergency cortisone treatment for an insect bite on August 28 and then failed a dope test after a Serie A match two days later, the club said on Thursday. Cannavaro had requested an exemption after being treated for the bite but did not receive it before he was tested.         
	Meanwhile, Fabio Capello has confirmed his intention to start the World Cup finals with David James as his first-choice goalkeeper. The Italian is planning to play his strongest possible side against Ukraine in Englands penultimate Group Six World Cup qualifying match, with James set to return in place of Robert Green.

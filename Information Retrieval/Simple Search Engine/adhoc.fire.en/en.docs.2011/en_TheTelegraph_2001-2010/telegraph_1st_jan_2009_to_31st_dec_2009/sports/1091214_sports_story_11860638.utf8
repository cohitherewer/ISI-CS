	London: Arsenal scored twice in the second half Sunday to win 2-1 at Liverpool and keep the pressure on Chelsea and Manchester United at the top of the Premier League.         
	The Gunners trailed to a 41st-minute goal by Dirk Kuyt. But Liverpool defender Glen Johnson levelled the scores five minutes into the second half with an own goal and Andrei Arshavin hit the winner eight minutes later with a shot from the edge of the area that left goalkeeper Pepe Reina stranded.         
	Victory lifted Arsenal to 31 points, three fewer than defending champions United and six fewer than leaders Chelsea. But the top two sides have played one game more.         
	Liverpool, last seasons runners-up, remained stranded in the seventh place with 24 points and six losses in 16 matches.         
	But Liverpool could easily have led by more than a single goal after dominating the first half, with Fernando Torres shooting weakly at goalkeeper Manuel Almunia when he was unmarked in front of goal.         
	Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas said coach Arsene Wenger had been appalled at his teams first-half performance.         
	The boss screamed at us like never before, Fabregas said.         
	He said we did not deserve to wear the Arsenal shirt if we played like that.         
	Defender Thomas Vermaelen said Wengers tirade had roused the team from their stupor.         
	Ive never seen him before like that and we just reacted very well, Vermaelen said. We put some pressure on them and you see the result.         
	It was important for us because we closed the gap a little bit now and were back in the race again.         
	It was a mistake by Almunia that led to Kuyts first goal at the Anfield in three months.         
	Almunia punched weakly at a long-range free-kick by Fabio Aurelio and the ball fell straight to Kuyt in the area. The Netherlands forward had time to control the ball with his chest and prod it into the net.         
	But Arsenal started playing more narrowly in the second period and pressured the home midfield, resulting in possession being split more evenly.         
	The equaliser arrived after Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas played a pass to Samir Nasri out on the right. Jamie Carragher failed to clear the Frenchmans cross and the ball took a slight deflection off him before hitting Johnson and rolling into the back of the net.         
	Arshavin, who scored four goals at Anfield last season to earn his team a 4-4 draw, then collected the ball on the edge of the area.         
	A defender shielded him closely and seemingly blocked his way to goal, but the Russia international took one touch, turned and hit a shot between his opponents legs. Reina did not even have time to move his feet as the ball flew past him and into the net, off his right-hand post.         
	Arsenals win was especially valuable after second-place Manchester United lost 1-0 at home to Aston Villa on Saturday, when leaders Chelsea were held to a 3-3 draw by Everton.         
	The Gunners have a real chance of winning the title for the first time since 2004, although Arshavin limped off in injury time and may join fellow forwards Robin van Persie and Nicklas Bendtner injured on the sidelines.         
	Liverpool have seen their season go from bad to worse and now are absolutely off the pace in the title race. The Reds have dropped points against the weaker sides in the Premiership and Rafa Benitezs would surely have wanted his boys to take as many points off the big four as possible. That, however, hasnt really happened this season.         
	On match eve, Torres, the man who had a big contribution in the Reds finishing second last season had said that their title hopes were effectively over.         
	With Liverpool also exiting the Champions League at the group stage after Wednesdays 1-2 defeat to Fiorentina, the top two prizes have gone. All Liverpool players have to fight for is the FA Cup and the Europa League tr-ophy while ensuring they finish in the top four to qualify for Europes elite competition next season.         
	We are really far out from the Premier League, so now we change our targets, Torres had said. We have to think the Europa League and FA Cup are the two competitions we can win this season and obviously trying to stay in the top four. Staying together is the main thing now.         
	If we can stay together  manager, players, staff, everyone at the club  we have quality enough to stay in the top four and win trophies, Torres added.         
	That looks increasingly difficult with the recent spate of poor results for the club. Especially when after every on-field disappointment comes fresh speculation that heads are about to roll at Anfield.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gay wins in 9.69 
                                                   Gay wins in 9.69 
                      
	Shanghai: Former world champion Tyson Gay equalled the second fastest 100 metres time ever on Sunday when he clocked 9.69 seconds at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix.         
	Gays time equalled the world record set by Jamaican Usain Bolt when he won the 100 metres final at last years Beijing Olympics.         
	Bolt reduced his mark to 9.58 seconds at this years Berlin world championships with Gay second in 9.71.         
	Gay, who has been suffering from a strained groin, told reporters he would be more motivated to challenge Bolts world record when he was fully fit.         
	Im not too motivated because Ive not been fully healthy ...I ran my run so well even though my groin hurts, he said.         
	Gays teammate Carmelita Jeter overtook Marion Jones as the worlds second fastest women over 100 metres when she clocked 10.64 seconds. Only the late Florence Griffith-Joyner has run faster.         
	The biggest cheer of the night came when former world and Olympic champion Liu Xiang looked to have edged Terrence Trammell in his first 110 metres hurdles race in more than a year.         
	However, the American was given the victory with both men clocking 13.15 seconds.         
	Russian Yelena Isinbayeva failed in three attempts to improve her own pole vault world record of 5.06 metres.           (REUTERS)

            A STAFF REPORTER            Stanley Rozario (right) with Edmilson at the East Bengal club ground on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Stanley Rozario entered the East Bengal ground on a rain-sodden Wednesday afternoon for the first time since his sacking in December 2008. And it was one of his former wards  Brazilian enfant terrible Edmilson  who was there to welcome the Lajong coach the moment he stepped onto the pitch.         
	A brief hello and Rozario was quickly into the thick of things, instructing the Aibor Khongjees and Daniels. They are here for the IFA Shield and have a job at hand, playing as they do Mohammedan Sporting in Sundays opener.         
	Inside the East Bengal tent there Subhas Bhowmick, Roazarios successor, was in the middle of a news conference. Stanley wasnt aware that Bhowmick was there and was diplomatic when asked whether it would be a cordial meeting were the two to bump into each other.         
	Lets talk of something else, Rozario said.         
	The practice session was typical Rozario. Focussing more on shapes and formations. Its something he learnt during his days with national coach Bob Houghton.         
	We are a young side and there is a lot of enthusiasm in these boys. You can expect a lot of running and we will give our rivals a run for their money, he said.         
	With central defender Daniel sure to make the cut as the first foreigner, Stanley said he was yet to decide on the second. It is a toss up between Jack (Liberia) and Michael (Nigeria).         
	The practice session gave an impression that Michael will be the other foreigner. But Stanley said there was still time. Its about the combination, he said.         
	Asked about the ground condition, Rozario remarked that the East Bengal ground had improved a lot. I am impressed with the ground. Its much better from when I was at the helm here, he said.         
	Its not just Rozario, even skipper Aiborlang Khongjee must have felt a sense of dj vu when he walked onto the East Bengal turf.         
	The right back was in the red and gold brigade when Subrata Bhattacharya was the coach, a couple of seasons back.         
	The Lajong academy product could not handle the Maidan pressure and left midway through the season.         
	Such was his homesickness that at times he used to cry. In fact, Aiborlangs native place in Meghalaya was so cut off from the rest of the world that it was difficult to communicate, a senior player, who was then with the red and gold brigade, said.         
	Bhattacharya also was highly impressed by Aiborlangs talent and East Bengal officials sent Poibong Poshna, his friend, to track him down. He just refused to come back, a club official said.         
	Aiborlang said on Wednesday that he was happy going back to his roots and that he wants to forget his East Bengal tryst.         
	There was some personal problem during my stay here. But these are things of the past. I am looking forward to a great season with Lajong.         
	 Yes! The entire Northeast too is looking forward to something special from Aiborlang and his band of brothers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bolt: CWG decision next year
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bolt: CWG decision next year
                      
	New Delhi: Undecided about his participation in the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games, Olympic and world champion sprinter Usain Bolt said the final call on the matter would be taken by his coach next summer.         
	Bolt said the decision would depend on how well his training goes.         
	My coach Glen Mills will make this decision next summer depending on how my training and racing is going, Bolt said.         
	The Jamaicans participation in the Games has been a subject of much speculation in the past few months as he has refused to commit to the event, hinting that he would prefer to go slow on his international assignments next year.         
	CWG organising committee chairman Suresh Kalmadi has requested Bolt to participate in the Games, the build-up to which has been marred by delay in construction work and open disagreements between the International Olympic Committee and the Commonwealth Games Federation.         
	Triple Olympic gold medallist Bolt said his primary target next season is to do well in the IAAF Diamond league.         
	In 2010, I will target the IAAF Diamond League, in 2011 the main target will be the IAAF World Track and Field Championships in Korea, said the world-record holder sprinter.         
	I am now preparing for the 2010 IAAF Diamond League which will take place all over the world from May to August next year, he said.         
	Bolt said he would be trying to better his own record of 9.58s but ruled out setting any targets for himself.         
	I dont try to set limits on myself. When I ran 9.7 people spoke of 9.6. When I ran 9.6, people spoke of 9.5. Now, who knows? he said.         
	It gives me a lot of motivation to be the worlds fastest man. I dont really chase times but mainly try to win races. he said.         
	Bolt said fellow Jamaican Asafa Powell and American Tyson Gay were his toughest competitors.         
	For me, Tyson Gay and Asafa Powell have been the toughest competitors in the past few years. But I think my record is safe at the moment but there are some very good sprinters out there so you never know, Bolt said.         
	On his equation with Powell, Bolt said despite being very competitive on the track, they are good friends off it.         
	We are good friends off the track but when we get on track, it is all business and everyone is trying to win, he said.         
	Bolt said maintaining his fitness level is the key to his success.

                                                   Tax worry for ad hoc panel 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) ad hoc committee on hockey now has a new problem.         
	According to the ad hoc committee sources, the department of income tax has issued a notice to the IOA-run body for not paying tax on income worth Rs 2 crore.         
	Sources said that the tax was due from several sponsorship deals the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) had struck in the last few years.         
	Obviously, it is a case of mistaken identities, said the source. The money was supposed to be paid by the K.P.S. Gill-run IHF. Since the IHF has been disbanded, the income tax department has sent the notice to the ad hoc committee.         
	When contacted, IOA treasurer A.K. Mattoo admitted that he had indeed received a notice from the income tax department. It wasnt meant for us, Mattoo said. The IOA has been running the game only for the last few months. Before that it was the IHF which was managing the show. So, I have sent the notices to K.P.S. Gill and K. Jothikumaran.         
	Mattoo said that he has also filed an appeal with the tax department as a precautionary measure. We have written to them pointing out that we could not be held responsible for unpaid taxes. They have to go to the old IHF to recover the money.         
	An ad hoc committee member, however, said it was the fault of the IOA.         
	When the IHF was disbanded, no effort was made to seize the account books. No one even bothered to close their bank accounts. We have no idea whatsoever about the IHFs financial position.         
	Neither Gill nor Jothikumaran were available for comments.

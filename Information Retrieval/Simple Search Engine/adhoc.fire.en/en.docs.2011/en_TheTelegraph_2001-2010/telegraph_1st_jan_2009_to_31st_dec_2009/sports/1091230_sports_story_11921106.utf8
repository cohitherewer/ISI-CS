The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pak hopes rest on captain Yousuf

            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Shane Watson                           
	Melbourne: Captain Mohammed Yousuf will hold the key as Pakistan chase a record 422 for victory after Shane Watsons maiden Test century gave Australia the upper hand heading into the final day of the first Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.         
	Yousuf (45 not out) and exciting youngster Umar Akmal (27 not out) steered the visitors to 170 for three at stumps on Day IV, still requiring a further 252 runs with seven wickets remaining to pull off what would be the most successful run chase in Test history.         
	Ricky Ponting earlier declared Australias innings closed on 225 for eight, midway through the second session.         
	To win, Pakistan must surpass the highest-ever successful chase of 418 made by the West Indies in their defeat of Australia at St Johns in 2003.         
	Having come so close on three previous occasions already this summer, Watson finally broke through for his first Test century shortly after lunch.         
	This match, however, now rests in the hands Pak batsmen after Australia forged into a formidable lead on the penultimate day, despite the efforts of Mohammed Aamer, who finished with five for 79.         
	The 17-year-old had threatened to turn the match in Pakistans favour with his first five-wicket haul in Tests.

                                                                                                                                   Bungling may cost Delhi Lanka ODI
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The mismanagement in the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) reached such a level in the lead up to the third one-day International between India and Australia, on October 31, that even Match Referee Chris Broad didnt get his quota of passes.         
	Broad is understood to have complained. But, then, he wasnt the only one to do so. Apparently, some of the boards affiliated units were also denied passes.         
	Upset with the happenings, Board president Shashank Manohar has asked secretary N. Srinivasan to seek an explanation from the DDCA within 72 hours.         
	One learns that if DDCAs explanation is not satisfactory, the December 27 one-dayer between India and Sri Lanka could be moved to another venue.         
	Significantly, DDCA president Arun Jaitley, who is a senior BJP leader, had been in Bangalore in the lead up to the October 31 ODI, trying to defuse the crisis which almost saw the exit of Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa.         
	In the same tours, programmes and fixtures committee meeting on Monday, the Board also rejected Services plea of rescheduling their Ranji Trophy encounter against Jammu amp; Kashmir.

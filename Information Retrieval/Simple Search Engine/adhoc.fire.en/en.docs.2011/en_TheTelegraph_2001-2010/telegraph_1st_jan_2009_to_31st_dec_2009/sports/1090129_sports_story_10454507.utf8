            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: South African player-umpire Marais Erasmus believes the concept of neutral umpires is a safer option although it might not necessarily be the best.         
	The 43-year-old became part of history this month when he officiated in the Duleep Trophy match between South Zone and Central in Bangalore. As per an agreement between the Board of Control for Cricket in India and Cricket South Africa, Indias Sunil Shastri officiated in South African domestic cricket earlier this season.         
	Erasmus, an ICC International Panel umpire, felt that there was nothing wrong in umpires standing in home matches. It (neutral umpire) is the safer option. I dont want to comment about international cricket, but in South Africa it (standing in home matches) happens, the South African said.

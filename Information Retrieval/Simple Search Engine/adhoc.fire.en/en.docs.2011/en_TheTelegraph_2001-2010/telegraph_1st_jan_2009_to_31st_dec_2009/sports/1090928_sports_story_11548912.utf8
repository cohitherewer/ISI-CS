	Kyoto: Jyoti Randhawa found the going tough amid swirling winds at the Joyo Country Club and turned in a disappointing five-over 76 in the final round to sign off tied 16th at the Panasonic Open golf tournament here Sunday.         
	The Delhi golfer finished with a total of two-over 286.         
	Gaganjeet Bhullar also finished over-par carding a three-over in the final round to total 10-over 294. Bhullar ended his campaign tied 55th.         
	It wasnt the best of starts for Randhawa as he dropped a bogey on the first hole before stumbling to a double bogey on the second. He parred the remaining holes of his front-nine to be three-over at the turn.         
	The back-nine was no better as Randhawa dropped shots on the 10th 13th, 16th and 18th holes.

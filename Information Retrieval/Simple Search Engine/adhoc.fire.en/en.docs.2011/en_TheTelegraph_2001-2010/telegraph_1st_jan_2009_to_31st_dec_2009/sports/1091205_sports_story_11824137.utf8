            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The CAB has rightly objected to the appointment of umpire Abdul Azim and match referee Baldev Gossain for Bengals next Vijay Merchant (U-16) Trophy match against Jharkhand in Siliguri from December 8-10.         
	Both Azim and Gossain are from Jharkhand, which has put their appointment under the scanner.         
	We have sent a letter to the BCCI requesting them to assign neutral umpires. The match is a crucial one for us, CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey said.

                                                   Bangla make it 2-0
                      
	Bulawayo: Stand-in captain Shakib-al Hasan hit a century while opener Tamim Iqbal added 80 runs Tuesday to guide Bangladesh to a 49-run victory over Zimbabwe in the second one-day International of the five-match series.         
	Shakib, who was dropped twice on 67 and 70 by Stuart Matsikenyeri and Ray Price respectively, faced 64 balls and cracked nine boundaries and four sixes on his way to 104. Tamim hit five boundaries and a six in his innings as Bangladesh recorded a daunting total of 320 for eight at the Queens Sports Club.         
	Shakib said he was enjoying the Zimbabwean conditions. Its a concrete wicket and 300 is not good enough, he joked.         
	The wicket looks good for batting and we are all enjoying it. (AP)

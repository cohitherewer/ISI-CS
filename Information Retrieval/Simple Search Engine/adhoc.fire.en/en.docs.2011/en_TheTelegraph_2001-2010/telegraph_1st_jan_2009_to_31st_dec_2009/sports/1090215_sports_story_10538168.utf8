	Eng vs Aus, 3rd Test in Headingley, Aug. 14-19, 1975. Match drawn.

	Captains: A. Greig, I. Chappell. Toss: England. Umpires: D. Constant, A. Fagg.         
	Note: Match was abandoned on the fifth day after vandals, campaigning for the release of a convicted criminal, sabotaged the Rugby Ground End of the pitch with knives and oil.               
	WI vs Eng, 1st Test in Kingston, Jan. 29, 1998. Match drawn.         
	England (1st innings): 17/3.         
	Captains: M. Atherton, B. Lara. Toss: England. Umpires: S. Bucknor, S. Venkataraghavan.         
	Note: Play was suspended after 10.1 overs (56 minutes) after the batsmen had been struck several times by balls which lifted dangerously off a length. Lengthy discussions ensued and after another 10 minutes, the players left the field. The match was abandoned an hour-and-a-half later. An additional Test was scheduled from February 5-9 in Port-of-Spain.               
	Eng vs Pak, 4th Test in London, Aug 17-21, 2006. England were awarded the match.         
	England (1st innings): 173.         
	Pakistan (1st innings): 504.         
	England (2nd innings): 298/4.         
	Captains: A. Strauss, I. Haq. Umpires: B. Doctrove, D. Hair. Toss: Pakistan.         
	Note: Pakistan refused to come out after the tea break on the fourth day, leading to the umpires awarding the match to England. Despite Pakistan later being willing to play, the umpires insisted the result must stand. This was confirmed by the respective Boards later that night. The match was originally awarded to England. This result was amended to an abandonment by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in July 2008. In January 2009, the ICC voted to reverse their earlier decision and allow the original awarding of the Test to England to stand.               
	Eng vs WI, 1st Test at St Johns, February 13, 2009. Match drawn.         
	England (1st innings): 7/0 (in 1.4 overs).

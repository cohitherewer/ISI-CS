The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan meet Sporting
                                                                                                                                   Bagan meet Sporting
                      
	Margao: Sporting Clube de Goa are up against a formidable rival in Mohun Bagan when they meet in a seventh-round match of the I-League at the Nehru Stadium on Saturday.         
	With six rounds completed, it has been a roller-coaster ride for Bagan. They started disastrously, losing their first two matches before bouncing back, winning the next three on the trot.         
	But loss in their last match, against Mumbai FC at home, has dented their morale somewhat. Key player Jose Ramirez Barreto is not fully fit and Bagan will once again be relying on Edeh Chidi, their mainstay upfront, to deliver the goods.         
	Sporting are struggling to register their first win from five matches. They have drawn two and lost three and occupy the bottom rung on the league table. (PTI)

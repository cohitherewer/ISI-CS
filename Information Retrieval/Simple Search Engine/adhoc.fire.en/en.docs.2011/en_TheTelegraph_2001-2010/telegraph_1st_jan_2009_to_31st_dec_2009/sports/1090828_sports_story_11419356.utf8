	Brussels: Belgian media were speculating on a possible return to womens tennis of former world No. 1 and multiple Grand Slam winner Justine Henin, 15 months after she retired from the game.         
	Noting that Henin is back in training for exhibition matches, several papers have speculated she may return to the circuit as compatriot Kim Clijsters did earlier this summer.         
	Vers Avenir newspaper reported: Juju has as good as taken her decision to return to competition from January.         
	Neither the Belgian tennis federation nor the player herself commented on the rumours  seven-time Grand Slam title winner Henin is currently abroad working on a charity campaign with Unicef.         
	Close friend and former coach Carlos Rodriguez played down the rumours.         
	Theres nobody telling me of a return. Weve not spoken about that. I am really astonished, he insisted. (AFP)

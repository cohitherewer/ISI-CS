The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shabbir Ali relies on Eduardo, Sunday
                                                   Shabbir Ali relies on Eduardo, Sunday
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting are not expecting a cakewalk, like the one they had against Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) in the first match, when they take on George Telegraph in a CFL Premier Division tie at their home ground on Thursday.         
	As coach Shabbir Ali puts it: They (George) are a good side. They finished fourth in the last season. So they cant be taken lightly, Shabbir said Wednesday.         
	Against George, Sporting would be banking on the strike duo of Theodore Sunday and Eduardo to deliver once again. Eduardo scored a brace against CPT and seemed like enjoying his stint with the club, while Sunday was quite impressive in his first match coming from an injury.         
	With strikers like Dipendu Biswas and Nilendra Diwan waiting in the wings, Shabbir is not bothered about the goals. We are not changing the winning combination, he said.         
	Sporting also have some talented attacking halves in Bapi Chowdhury and Jyothi Kumar and they will prove to be the thorn in their rivals flesh.         
	Chowdhury, in particular, was a livewire against CPT, combining well with Eduardo and Sunday. The under-19 player should serve the club well this season.         
	The defence, though, did not look confident enough against CPT and Sporting may rue releasing Peter Odafe. The likes of Anupam Sarkar and Amrit Pal Singh can thwart lesser players but will they be able to handle Edeh Chidi or Abel Hammond when they come calling?         
	George though have lost some of those regulars who starred in last seasons brilliant league run. Shubho Kumar, Safar Sardar and a few have left for bigger clubs and coach Raghu Nandy is in the process of rebuilding the team.         
	I have limited resources but am confident of a good show. They wont get the match on a platter, the coach who took Bengal to the Santosh Trophy final said.         
	Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Mohammed Nooruddins hattrick enabled Tollygunge Agragami to beat Eastern Railway 3-2 at the Mohun Bagan ground.         
	Niladri Sekhar Chakraborty scored a brace for the losing side. In another match, at the Kalyani Stadium, Mohammedan AC beat Kalighat 2-0 with Kunal Ghosh and Saeedi on target. The match between CPT and Railway FC at Khardah ended in a goalless draw.

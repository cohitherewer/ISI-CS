                                                   Pujara shines in 6-wkt victory
                      
	Cuttack: Cheteshwar Pujara starred with an unbeaten 53 as eight-time champions West Zone thrashed minnows Zimbabwe Presidents XI by six wickets to sail into the final of the Deodhar Trophy here on Monday.         
	Electing to bat first, the touring Zimbabwe side never had it easy against heavyweights West who came up with a tidy bowling performance to restrict the visitors to 176 for nine in their stipulated 50 overs at the Barabati Stadium.         
	Chasing the paltry total, West rode on an unbeaten 53 by Pujara to romp home in 38.1 overs in their Group B encounter.         
	With five points from the match, they ended the league stage at the top of Group B with 10 points.         
	West began on a cautious note with their openers Parthiv Patel and Ajinkya Rahane opting to take time to settle down. Former India wicketkeeper Parthiv (7) became the victim of Elton Chigumbura.         
	The visitors fielding was not up to the mark as C. Mpofu dropped Rahane off Graham Cremer. Rahane (41) steadied the innings with Pujara, sharing 40 runs for the second wicket before the former departed having faced 49 balls.         
	Pujara combined in a match-winning stand with Ravindra Jadeja (28 not out). Jadeja started attacking from the outset and hit three sixes and one four in 13 balls as West reached their target with more than 11 overs to spare.         
	Leg spinner Iqbal Abdulla was the most successful West bowler, claiming three for 28 from his nine overs.         
	However, it was Jadeja who gave the Zimbabwe side some tough time, conceding just 27 runs from his quota of 10 overs. Jadeja bagged two wickets.         
	For Zimbabwe Presidents XI, Stuart Matsikenyeri scored a defiant 44 from 74 balls. In fact, it was the duo of Matsikenyeri and Regis Chakava (30) who repaired the innings from 55 for three to 130 for four.

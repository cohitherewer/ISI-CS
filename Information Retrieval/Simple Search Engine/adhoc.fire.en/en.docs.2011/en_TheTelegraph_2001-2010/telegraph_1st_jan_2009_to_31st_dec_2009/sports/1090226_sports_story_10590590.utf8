The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Captain Dhoni blames it on irresponsible batting 
                                                   Captain Dhoni blames it on irresponsible batting 
                      
	Christchurch: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni Wednesday blamed the seven-wicket loss to New Zealand on irresponsible batting by his teammates.         
	The Indian captain, suffering his third defeat in 12 Twenty20 matches, felt that his batsmen went after the New Zealand bowlers without proper planning, which led to his side losing too many wickets at the beginning of the innings.         
	I think most of the batsmen batted brilliantly but the mistake we committed was that we went with the momentum.         
	Maybe one of the batsmen could have realised that we had got off to a flier and needed to stay put at the crease, said Dhoni.         
	 Throughout the IPL and other Twenty20 games, we have seen that even if you bat out 20 overs, you dont score more than 200 runs.         
	So you have to decide whether you are happy with a score of 180 or 190. Or whether you look for those extra 25 runs which we dont actually need and end up getting 160-odd, a total which is difficult for the bowlers to defend in conditions like these and on wickets that are placid, Dhoni said.         
	Praising New Zealand for their measured approach, Dhoni said: They got a good start even though they didnt get off to a flier like us.         
	One thing is for sure, in Twenty20, we need wickets in hand at the end and thats what they did. If you have five wickets in hand in the last five overs, I think you have an upper hand.         
	On whether India missed a seamer, Dhoni said: This is the kind of team that we have always played with where an extra spinner or a part-time spinner has contributed. If we play an extra seamer, the batting is not as long and deep as you would prefer in a Twenty20 game. I was quite happy with the kind of combination we played with, said Dhoni.         
	The Indian captain, however, was happy with the bowlers performance.         
	The bowlers did a fantastic job, especially Harbhajan Singh, who was playing after a long time. He was in good rhythm and was bowling the yorker superbly. Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma contributed as well, Dhoni said.         
	We have learnt a lot from our mistakes. We are a good side that learns very quickly. Fortunately, we have youngsters who are willing to learn from the mistakes. If we dont commit these mistakes again, we have a very good chance, Dhoni said.         
	Asked if New Zealand would have the psychological edge after winning the tour opener, Dhoni said: New Zealand know that if we dont commit these mistakes again, they will have to chase a big score. Its not about putting pressure on the opposition but about performing on the field.         
	You can win a game with a big margin but the next day, its a fresh start again. One or two games dont matter as long as you dont lose a series and get bogged down. For us, it is important to do well in every game, he added.         
	New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori heaped praise on his bowlers for restricting the visitors to 162.         
	There are a number of aspects I was pleased with. Obviously, we were put under immense pressure at the start. I am happy in the way the bowlers responded to it and the way they restricted a destructive team like India to around 160, Vettori said.         
	The left-arm spinner also picked up wicketkeeper-batsman Brendon McCullum for special mention. The opening batsman guided New Zealand to victory with an unbeaten 56 that included three sixes.         
	In the chase, McCullum was the rock. Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor and Jacob Oram played around him. I couldnt really have many complaints, said Vettori.         
	McCullum praised the efforts of Guptill and Taylor.         
	The way Martin batted upfront, and the way he put pressure back on India was fantastic, said McCullum, who shared a 54-run partnership with Guptill and then added another 50 with Taylor.         
	He lauded the youngsters in the side and said: They did play with a lot of confidence. Ross has been playing well for a long time. Martin has come in and had some success early on. Those two guys in particular are pretty confident at the moment.

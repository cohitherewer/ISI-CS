The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Alves stunning goal breaks SA hearts 
                                                     Alves stunning goal breaks SA hearts 
                  Daniel Alves celebrates with Robinho after scoring against South Africa during their Confederations Cup semi-final in Johannesburg on Thursday                     
	Johannesburg: Daniel Alves scored with two minutes left on Thursday to give a lacklustre Brazil a 1-0 win over South Africa and a place in the Confederations Cup final against the United States.         
	South Africa had unsettled Brazil with a frantic hustling game of quick challenges and tight marking, but the substitute defender curled in a free-kick from the edge of the penalty box to give his team a chance of a record third title, as briefly reported in Fridays late city edition.         
	The game was very closed so I put on a very quick player, a very aggressive player, who is strong on set pieces, Brazil coach Dunga said. It was one of the few opportunities we were going to have. The foul was right in front of the goal area, so it was perfect for us.         
	South Africas packed midfield and attentive defence had displayed far more energy and guile than Brazil, and Bafana Bafana were denied a famous victory only by the lack of finishing up front.         
	Instead, Brazil held on for a seventh straight win and a place in Sundays final at Ellis Park against the United States, who upset European champion Spain 2-0 Wednesday.         
	Im always ready to come in, regardless of where the coach wants me to play, said Daniel Alves, normally a right back who came in on the left of defence in the 82nd. I just wanted to go out there and do everything I could to help the team. Gladly it worked out perfectly.         
	Dunga said he had not watched the United States since the group stage, where Brazil beat the Americans 3-0. I didnt watch the game on Wednesday night because I was more concerned with our semi-final, Dunga said.         
	Just four days after routing World Cup holder Italy 3-0, defending Confederations Cup champion Brazil looked short of ideas and laboured in their efforts to find an opening  largely trying to play through the middle.         
	But that was mostly due to a vastly improved home team, which covered almost 10 percent more ground throughout the game and matched their opponents 12 shots on goal.         
	Only former World Player of the Year Kaka seemed able to direct his passes with any regular accuracy as South Africa equalled their illustrious opponents skill and surpassed their work rate.         
	South Africa finally showed fans they could be something of a force at next years World Cup, shrugging off indifferent group form to outplay the record five-time World Cup winners.         
	Maybe with a years preparation, we can win a game like this against Brazil, South Africa coach Joel Santana said. You cannot make these mistakes. A set piece was enough to knock us out of the semifinals.         
	With central defender Matthew Booth snuffing out almost every attempted attack from the wayward Luis Fabiano and ineffective Robinho, Brazils best chances had been shots from Ramires, Andre Santos and Kaka that goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune easily saved.         
	We played in a similar way to the way we did against Spain, Booth said. We knew Brazil would have a lot of possession and we had to get players behind the ball. But we had a go at them.         
	Backed up by Siphiwe Tshabalala, who replaced the suspended MacBeth Sibaya, Teko Modise put three disappointing displays behind him to drive the home midfield and came close to securing a famous win when his 58th-minute shot deflected off defender Luisao and almost beat goalkeeper Julio Cesar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Black day for Red Devils
                                                   Black day for Red Devils
                      
	London: Champions Manchester United imploded at Fulham on Saturday when Paul Scholes and Wayne Rooney were sent off in a 2-0 defeat at Fulham which blew the title race wide open.         
	Scholes was dismissed for handball on the line in the 18th minute which gave Danny Murphy the chance to put Fulham in front from the penalty spot and Rooney was red-carded for throwing the ball towards the referee after Zoltan Gera had made it 2-0.         
	The shock of their first back-to-back defeats in the Premier League since 2005 was softened as second-placed Chelsea wasted the chance to narrow the gap to one-point when they lost 0-1 at Tottenham Hotspur in a match delayed by a security scare.         
	Luka Modrics second-half goal ended Chelsea boss Guus Hiddinks unbeaten start since taking over in February and made it a great day for third-placed Liverpool who host Aston Villa on Sunday.         
	United lead the table with 65 points from 29 games while Chelsea have 61, having played a match more.         
	Liverpool also have 61 points from 29 games played.         
	Portsmouths prospects of avoiding relegation were also boosted by Peter Crouch scoring twice to secure a 2-1 victory over Everton.         
	The three points had looked in doubt when Leighton Baines put Everton ahead in the fourth minute with a free kick that curled in off the far post.         
	It was massive we got a win today, Crouch said. We started badly. Thankfully we showed a lot of character to come back.         
	Pompey, who had won just one of their last 13 league matches, levelled in the 22nd when a corner was only half cleared before reaching Glen Johnson, who headed across goal for Crouch to find the net.         
	The England forward pounced again with 15 minutes remaining at Fratton Park, heading past United States goalkeeper Tim Howard. Bottom club West Bromwich Albion look doomed after a 1-1 home draw with Bolton Wanders. Blackburn Rovers also drew 1-1 with West Ham United. United had not lost at Fulham since 1964 and recently won there 4-0 in the FA Cup to go with a 3-0 win at Old Trafford in the league.         
	However, the match swung Fulhams way after 18 minutes when Bobby Zamora headed goalwards after Edwin Van der Sar had saved an effort by Brede Hangeland and Scholes used his hands to stop the ball going over the line.         
	Scholes was sent off before Murphy, a former Liverpool midfielder, placed his penalty beyond Van der Sar.         
	That was a double blow, you miss a great player like Scholes and of course they got the penalty, Uniteds Ryan Giggs said later.         
	It knocked us off track a little bit. The lads were determined to get back on track but in the first half Edwin Van der Sar kept us in it. We were the better team by far in the second half.         
	United manager Alex Ferguson replaced the sluggish Dimitar Berbatov at halftime and sent on Wayne Rooney to revive the visitors.         
	United duly pinned Fulham back but Mark Schwarzer made several fine stops before Gera finished off a flowing move to clinch a victory that should make them safe from relegation.         
	A frustrated Rooney then compounded Uniteds day of misery when he appeared to throw the ball angrily towards referee Phil Dowd and was sent off.         
	United have now had three players dismissed in their last two games.           (REUTERS)

                                                     Chetri: I want to stay with EB
  - India striker wants club to make the first move       A STAFF REPORTER              Chetri                                 
	Calcutta: Sunil Chetri would like to stay with East Bengal for one more season but he wants the club to make the first move. Talking to reporters after a practice session at the Howrah Stadium on Friday, Chetri said he would be more than happy to stay with East Bengal. I have no complaints against my club. They are taking good care of me. I want to stay and I think I can give a lot more in the next season. But the club has to come to me and it cant be the other way round, Chetri said.         
	Chetri said he has the highest respect for coach Subhas Bhowmick who he felt was doing a wonderful job.         
	Chetris decision to stay back comes at a time when the India international is being sounded out by Dempo Sports Club of Goa. So, dont be surprised if he does a volte-face in the near future.         
	Chetri, the highest scorer till now among the domestic players in the ongoing I-League with nine goals, said this season hasnt been good for the red and gold brigade. We faltered at crucial junctures. Weve had three coaches in one season and I think that hampered the rhythm. But next season, with Bhowmick calling the shots, I am confident of a better show, he said.         
	Chetri refused to comment on the club brand ambassador Alvito DCunhas decision to go for a pay cut. I havent read what appeared in the newspapers and neither did I talk to him. But as brand ambassador for the club he said something. And I also think its his personal decision to go for the cut, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Dempo midfielder Betos arrival in the city on Thursday has raised quite a few eyebrows. While the rest of the players touched down on Friday to play their remaining I-League matches  versus Mohun Bagan on Sunday and versus East Bengal on April 16  the Brazilian apparently brought his visit forward to spend some time with compatriot and friend Jose Ramirez Barreto.         
	Betos wife is also here for the Easter weekend. Dont read too much into everything, a source close to Barreto said.         
	But in this time of the season when every move a player makes is scrutinised, Betos visit seems to be interesting. He has already gone public with his desire to play for East Bengal and his respect for Bhowmick. A senior club official however said that unless he (Beto) has the release order from Dempo, theres no point talking about him.

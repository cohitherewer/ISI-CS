The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | T20 no big deal for Test players, says Kallis
                                                   T20 no big deal for Test players, says Kallis
                      
	Cape Town: All-rounder Jacques Kallis feels that cricketers playing Test cricket can play any form of the game including the shortest version.         
	Kallis also said the Bangalore Royal Challengers, who finished last in the inaugural edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), have what it takes to make it to the semi-finals of the second edition.         
	They started their campaign by stunning defending champions the Rajasthan Royals.         
	Notwithstanding their loss in the second match, the Royal Challengers looked a completely different side this time and Kallis credited the turnaround to coach Ray Jennings and new skipper Kevin Pietersen.         
	Kallis feels senior pros like Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble and others, regarded as Test players, have justified their worth in Twenty20 cricket in the first few matches of the tournament.         
	I think players that are playing Test cricket are more than good enough to play Twenty20 cricket. If you are playing Test cricket, you can play any form of the game. It has been proven, he said.           (PTI)

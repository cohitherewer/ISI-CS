The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB takes a dig at Raja
                                                   CAB takes a dig at Raja
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Jagmohan Dalmiya said on Tuesday that it was not his prerogative to invite someone to watch Bengal players in action. He said that he could only ask the Bengal selectors to go and watch the Laxmi Ratan Shuklas and Wriddhiman Sahas play but not someone else. I cant take moral responsibility for that, he said.         
	The dig was obviously at Raja Venkat, the national selector from East Zone. Raja has been at the receiving end of the CAB officials ire for not pushing the Bengal players case during selection committee meetings. For the record, Wriddhiman Saha was in the 30-member probables list for the Champions Trophy to be held in South Africa from September 22, but failed to make the cut.         
	His detractors, in fact, have accused him of not watching enough Bengal matches. What can you expect from him when he hardly watches any match, one of the detractors said.         
	Venkat refuted the allegations and said he never skipped Bengal matches. Thats rubbish. Its just that I watch matches alone from the clubhouse, he argued.         
	The spat between the CAB and Venkat is nothing new. Sourav Ganguly also played his part to reignite the row. During the last CAB annual general meeting on July 31, Sourav had questioned the rationale behind the national selector from East Zone not being in Bengals selection committee.

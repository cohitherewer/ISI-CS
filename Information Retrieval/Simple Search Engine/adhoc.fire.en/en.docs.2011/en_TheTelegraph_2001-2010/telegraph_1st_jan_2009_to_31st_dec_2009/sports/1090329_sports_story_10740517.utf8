	Bangkok: Japan and North Korea snatched the lead in their respective qualifying groups for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa by claiming home wins on Saturday.         
	Japan edged a point ahead in Group 1 with a 1-0 victory over Bahrain and surprise package North Korea beat United Arab Emirates 2-0 to move two clear at the top of Group 2 and edge closer to their first World Cup finals since 1966. Uzbekistan, whose campaign had looked to be over, lifted themselves off the bottom of Group 1 with a 4-0 rout of Qatar to boost their chances of securing a playoff berth.         
	Three-time Asian champions Japan had the best of the chances in Saitama and with three games to play they are almost certain to reach the tournament for the fourth time in a row.         
	They secured the three points when Shunsuke Nakamuras free kick, two minutes after the break, took a lucky deflection and sailed into the net. Japan have 11 points from five matches in Group 1. Australia, who are at home to Uzbekistan on Wednesday, are second with 10 points from four games. Uzbekistan are third with four points from five matches.         
	This win basically means Japan will qualify, Bahrains Czech coach Milan Macala said.         
	They have taken a big step and with 11 points Im sure they will go to the World Cup. Second-half strikes from Pak Nam-chol and Mun In-guk sparked euphoric scenes in Pyongyang and pushed the North Koreans ahead of fierce rivals South Korea while virtually killing off UAEs hopes of booking a playoffs berth.         
	North Korea lead Group 2 with 10 points from five matches, ahead of South Korea on eight points from four.         
	North Korea were frustrated early on by a UAE side who defended well but lacked drive going forward in what was a must-win game for groups bottom team.         
	North Korea came out fighting after the break and their tenacity paid off on 51 minutes when Pak unleashed a powerful left-foot drive into the top corner.           (REUTERS)

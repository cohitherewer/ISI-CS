The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Banerjee injures ankle
                                                                                                                       7                                      Banerjee injures ankle
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal opener Rohan Banerjee twisted his ankle while fielding during the third days play of Bengals Ranji Trophy encounter against Karnataka in Mysore. There is a chance that the first innings centurion may not open in the second innings.         
	But the good news for Bengal is that the injury is not serious after the X-ray report revealed that there is no fracture.         
	If I am allowed a runner from the beginning of the innings, I may open. Else, I will come at No 5 or 6. I am relieved that there isnt any hairline fracture. There is a little swelling But it has lessened after using the ice-pack. I have also had pain-killers, Banerjee informed. In case Banerjee is unable to open, Deep Dasgupta is likely to partner Arindam Das at the top.         
	Bengal captain Manoj Tiwary feels that saving the match wont be a problem as the pitch has eased out considerably.         
	The first day wicket expectedly had a lot of juice in it. The pitch eased out on the last two days. We have a good batting line-up. I am hopeful that we will bat out the final day, Tiwary said.         
	Off-spinner Sourasish Lahiri, who got his first five-wicket haul this season, is far from satisfied with his performance.         
	The pitch didnt offer much turn and bounce. I would have been happier had these five wickets come for 60-65 runs rather than 160, Lahiri said.

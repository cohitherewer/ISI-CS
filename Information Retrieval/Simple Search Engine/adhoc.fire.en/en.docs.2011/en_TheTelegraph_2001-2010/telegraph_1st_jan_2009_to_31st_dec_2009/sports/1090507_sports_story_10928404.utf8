The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ravi Bopara stands tall against fierce Fidel
                                                   Ravi Bopara stands tall against fierce Fidel
                      
	London: Ravi Bopara stood firm in the face of some magnificent fast bowling from Fidel Edwards on Wednesday to steer England to a respectable 289 for seven on the opening day of the first Test against the West Indies at Lords.         
	Bopara fully justified his promotion to the problematic number three spot with his second century in consecutive Tests, batting with painstaking application to reach 118 not out in his first Test at Lords.         
	Edwards bowled with sustained hostility, got some late away swing from the right handers but had no luck at all.         
	After bowling out Alastair Cook for 35, he dismissed Kevin Pietersen with his next ball  caught one-handed by wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin  and Paul Collingwood (8) was caught low down at second slip by Devon Smith. He also accounted for Matt Prior, caught in the covers for 42.         
	But after tea, Edwards had Bopara dropped at square leg by Brendan Nash on 76 then watched in frustration as Stuart Broad was put down on nine and 13. The West Indies dropped three more chances, two off Broad, who was finally out for 38.

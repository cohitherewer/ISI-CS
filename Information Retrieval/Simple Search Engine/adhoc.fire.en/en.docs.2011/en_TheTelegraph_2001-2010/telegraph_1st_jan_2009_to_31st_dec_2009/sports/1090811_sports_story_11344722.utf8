The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zaheer: We voiced universal concern
                                                     Zaheer: We voiced universal concern
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT    
	New Delhi: Zaheer Khan Monday said that the Indian cricketers had done athletes the world over a good turn by raising their voice against the controversial whereabouts clause of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) code.         
	Talking to the media during a promotional here, the spearhead said: I am confident that athletes all over the world found that particular clause objectionable but did not raise their voice. Someone had to take the initiative and cricketers came forward.         
	Zaheer said that neither he nor any of his 10 teammates named by the ICC in its registered pool for out-of-competition testing had any problem with the code except for the one clause dealing with whereabouts.         
	We do have an objection to the clause that requires us to inform them (Wada) about our availability and location three months in advance, said Zaheer. Otherwise we are ready to be tested anytime, added the left arm bowler.         
	Zaheer, however, hastened to add that the cricketers would abide by whatever the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) decides.         
	Asked to comment on his injury, Zaheer said he would be going back to South Africa soon for the second phase of rehabilitation. I am sure to return much stronger and fitter, he said.         
	Injuries are part and parcel of our life. I have to be patient and try to get back to my old self. I cannot rush things, Zaheer said.         
	At the moment I see it as an opportunity to work on my fitness. I want to return to the field at the earliest but at the same time, I dont want to let my team down. I want to return when I can give 110 per cent, Zaheer said.         
	Zaheer was confident that the bowling department would not suffer in the Champions Trophy despite the injury to him.         
	Ishant (Sharma) and Ashish (Nehra) are there. So, there is no need to panic, said Zaheer. They are perfectly capable of taking the responsibility. The most important thing is that India should win the tournament.         
	Zaheer is happy that Nehra could make a comeback to the team. Ashish faced a lot of injuries and as a fellow bowler and a close friend I know what he has gone through before making a comeback after four years, said Zaheer.         
	Zaheer said it was not right to say that the Boards sports medicine consultant Dr Anant Joshi had been kept in the dark regarding his injury. I kept the Board informed all along, Zaheer said.

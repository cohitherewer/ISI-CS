                                                     Coventry try out Chetri
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Sunil Chetri                           
	New Delhi: East Bengal striker Sunil Chetri, who reached England on Monday, has had two short training sessions with the Coventry City Football Club at their Ricoh Arena stadium.         
	The 24-year-old striker is likely to appear for a full trial on Thursday with the first team players of the English side.         
	Coventry, one of Englands most famous and traditional clubs, play in the League Championship, which is a tier below the Premier League.         
	Chetri has been mentioned as a possible recruit for the Sky Blues, coached by Chris Coleman, but the club officials are trying their best to avoid the media.         
	Asked to provide details on the trials and the clubs first impression of the Indian striker, Coventry City press officer Lara Thorns said she had no information.         
	At present we do not have any information on any player on trial with the club, she said.         
	I will add to our mailing list during the transfer window so you receive official information as and when it becomes available, she added.         
	Coventry coach Coleman, however, confirmed Chetris arrival and said: He trained with us yesterday and today and is here for a couple of weeks just for us to have a look at him.         
	Chetris agent, Yogesh Joshee, was not sure whether the Indian striker would get the nod from the recruiters, but was confident that Chetri stood a very good chance.         
	Otherwise, they wouldnt have invited him to join the trials here, he said. Chances are very bright that he will make the cut, the agent added.         
	According to reports reaching here, Chetris arrival in England has generated huge interest among the followers of Indian football. Minutes after his arrival, Chetri was interviewed by a local television channel. I am really optimistic and am looking forward to the trial. I just want to give 100 per cent, he had said.

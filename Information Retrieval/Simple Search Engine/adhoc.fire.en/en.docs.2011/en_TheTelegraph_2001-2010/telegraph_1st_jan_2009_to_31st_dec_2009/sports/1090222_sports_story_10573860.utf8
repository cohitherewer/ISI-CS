The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Md. Sp. snatch a point
                                                   Md. Sp. snatch a point
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mohammedan Sporting held on for a gallant 0-0 draw against Mahindra United, compounding the latters goal-scoring woes, in a 16th round I-League clash here Saturday.         
	It was the fourth goalless match in a row at the Cooperage, but languishing second from bottom on the league table, Mohammedan Sporting were happy to walk away with a valuable point.         
	At least we have one point. This is our first point against Mahindra in Mumbai, the Calcutta outfits coach Shabbir Ali said after the match.         
	As a team we are nothing in front of Mahindra whom I rate among the best four in the county, but we defended well. We now have two points from two matches (after a draw against Air India last month) at this ground.         
	Goalkeeper Naseem Akhtar was the bulwark of the Mohammedan Sporting defence as he repeatedly rose above the onrushing Mahindra forwards to either punch away or deflect the high balls.         
	Wasim Feroz and Gurpreet Singh combined with Adebayo in the middle and the hard-working Suroj Mondal was impressive in moving back and forth to keep the rival defenders on their toes.         
	For Mahindra, the finishing remains a puzzle yet to be solved.         
	Today, we tried red and black (jersey), next match we will try full red, coach Derrick Pereira said in jest. It is the same old story, he added.         
	With no goals in a fortnight, the pitch became a talking point.         
	It is a difficult ground because of the lack of grass and a lot of bounce. For a player like Sushil Kumar (Singh), who tries to play on the ground, it is difficult. It is an advantage for teams playing for a draw, Pereira said.         
	But Mahindra should be given credit for trying. Sushanth Mathew and Steven Dias made a number of incisive moves from the flanks, yet the goal remained elusive.         
	In the 31st minute, Douhou Pierre shot over the bar from close, and in the second half Arata Izumis header from a cross ricocheted off the bar. It was the only time Akhtar was beaten.         
	The visitors showed more offensive intention in the second half but lacked the bite to penetrate the Mahindra defence.         
	Teams         
	Mohammedan Sporting: Naseem Akhtar, Sheikh Azim, Mike Okoro, Suroj Mondal, Eugene Gray, Wasim Feroz, Gurpreet Singh, Adewusi Adebayo, Rajib Ghosh, Goutam Thakur (Ashim Das 83), Jothi Kumar (Lalhriatzuala Tezoka 60).         
	Mahindra United: Subhashish Chowdhury, Harpreet Singh (Paresh Shivalkar 71), Lamine Tambe, Sushanth Mathew, Mohammed Rafi (Edeh Chidi 58), Ravanan Dharmaraj, Sukhvinder Singh, Steven Dias, Debabrata Roy, Sushil Kumar Singh (Arata Izumi 59), Douhou Pierre.         
	Referee: .P. Thakur         
	Man of the Match: Gurpreet Singh         
	Mumbai FC are hoping to return to their goal-scoring ways when they take on Sporting Clube de Goa on Sunday. The I-League debutants, who have netted 16 times in 15 matches, failed to score against Mahindra United (0-0) and Dempo SC (0-3) in their last two games.         
	They would do well to pull up their socks against an opposition who have been equally prolific.

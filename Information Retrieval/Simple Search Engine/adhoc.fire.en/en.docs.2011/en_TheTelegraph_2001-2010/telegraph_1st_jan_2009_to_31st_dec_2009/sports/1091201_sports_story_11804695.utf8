  - Dip in form due to changed action hampers Parmars chances       A STAFF REPORTER            Kolkata Knight Riders coach Dav Whatmore with captain Sourav Ganguly at the Eden on Monday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Former Bengal captain Rohan Gavaskar is all set to join the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) for the upcoming edition of the Indian Premier League.         
	Rohan will be the fourth former ICL player to sign for the Shah Rukh Khan-owned franchise after they roped in Tamil Nadu all-rounder Ganapathy Vignesh, Madhya Pradesh middle-order batsman Syed Abbas Ali (grandson of the legendary Mushtaq Ali) and Bengal left-arm medium pacer Syed Eklakh Ahmed.         
	I havent yet signed on the dotted line but expect the formalities to be completed in a few days. I have always enjoyed playing T20 and this format suits my game. I am looking forward to a fruitful stint with KKR, Rohan said while leaving for Mumbai. He will not be present for Tuesdays session.         
	Interestingly, Gavaskar junior is set to bag an IPL-contract at a time when Bengal chairman of selectors Sambaran Banerjee has raised doubts about his inclusion in the squad for this seasons Ranji Trophy. Gavaskar has scores of 23, 16 not out and 46 not out in the three first-class innings he has played so far.         
	Eklakh was supposed to join the Mumbai Indians, but KKR skipper Sourav Ganguly showed initiative in roping in the left-armer.         
	Sourav helped me bag a KKR contract. I had attended a Mumbai Indians camp earlier this year before the KKR contacted me, revealed the bowler who has taken 29 wickets in 23 T20 matches in the ICL.         
	If Rohans recruitment comes as a surprise, the case of Gujarat off-spinner Mohnish Parmar seems to get more confusing by the day.         
	The franchise signed Parmar before the last edition of the T20 league but couldnt select him for IPL-II in South Africa because the BCCI was yet to clear him for suspect action.         
	The situation is unlikely to change this time for the 21-year-old offie although, recently, he was cleared by a National Cricket Academy panel comprising S. Venkatraghavan, Jawagal Srinath and A.V. Jayaprakash.         
	However, the clearance has come with its own share of problems. Parmars action has been literally overhauled and is more sideways. Also, the spinner is only getting negligible turn.         
	The result was a thrashing at the hands of Tamil Nadu. Parmar went for 87 runs in 18 wicketless overs in his first-class comeback match after two years. Due to the poor show, he has been dropped from the state squad.         
	Parmars name still figures prominently in the BCCIs list of bowlers with suspect action. The umpires have been told to keep a close check on his action when he is playing BCCI matches.         
	The problem with him is, whenever he is trying to bowl an off-break, his action cant be deemed fair. Now, with his changed action, he no longer is the same bowler he was a couple of seasons back. The moment he is not bending his arm, he is bowling flat, a former umpire in the know-of-things said Monday.         
	Yes, his (Parmars) action has undergone change. We need to give him time to settle down, a member of the KKR support staff said.         
	It will be interesting to see if the new KKR coach, Dav Whatmore, who had a close look at the bowler during his NCA days, can pull the youngster out of the mess.

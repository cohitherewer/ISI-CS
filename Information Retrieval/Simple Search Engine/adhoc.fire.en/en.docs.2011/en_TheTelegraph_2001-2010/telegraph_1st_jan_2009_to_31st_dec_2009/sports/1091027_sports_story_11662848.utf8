The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhowmick quits as EB coach 
                                                     Bhowmick quits as EB coach 
  - De Ridder likely successor; Barreto out for 3 weeks       A STAFF REPORTER            Subhas Bhowmick                                 
	Calcutta: On Sunday Subhas Bhowmick was down, a day later he was out. Taking moral responsibility for East Bengals 3-5 drubbing at the hands of Mohun Bagan, Bhowmicks days as red and gold brigade coach was over on Monday afternoon.         
	Bhowmicks likely successor is Phillippe de Ridder, the Belgian coach who was at the helm of affairs during the 2005-06 National League. Apparently De Ridder who shared a very good rapport with Bhaichung Bhutia during his previous stay, has agreed to a one-year contract. He is currently in Belgium and our officials did have a telephonic discussion with him. He asked for a two-year contract but later on he settled for a one-year deal. He will be reaching on October 30 or 31st. As things stand now, he is the most likely successor, an East Bengal source said.         
	On Thursday, though, when East Bengal play host to Salgaocar, assistant coach Tushar Rakshit will be guiding the boys from the bench and will be assisted by none other than Bhaichung Bhutia. This is not the first time though the India captain will be playing mentor. During his Mohun Bagan days, when trainer Robson was coach for a brief period, Bhaichung and Jose Ramirez Barreto pitched in with their ideas and the team went onto win the Fed Cup and were runners-up in IFA Shield.         
	Coming back to Bhowmick, the under-fire coach who was at his sulking best after the loss had hinted on Sunday itself that he should quit. And so it was not surprising that he put in his papers on Monday afternoon. I hold myself responsible for the teams failure, Bhowmick wrote in his resignation letter.         
	Bhowmicks 10-month stay with East Bengal has hardly been satisfactory. Apart from beating Mohun Bagan in the I-league match in February there has been nothing to write home about. Bhowmick has been bogged down by personal problems and that was clearly hampering our chances. Its good that he has quit, a top club official said on Monday night.         
	But secretary Kalyan Majumder was more forthright. Sacking Stanley Rosario was a big mistake. And we paid the price for that. For the record, the Lajong coach was at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday.         
	So what Mohun Bagan doing the day after? The team took an early morning flight to Guwahati and from thereon a four and half hours bus journey to Shillong where they play Lajong on Thursday. Deepak Mondal and Bishwajit Saha have been inducted into the squad.         
	We have come early to settle down to the conditions here, coach Karim Bencharifa said from the Meghalaya capital. It has been learnt that Sundays hero Edeh Chidi is nursing an ankle injury and the Bagan thinktank is following a wait-and-watch policy.         
	Barreto, who injured his hamstring on Sunday though stayed back and will be out for atleast 21 days. That means he will be missing four I-League matches. But going by the high they are on at the moment, it doesnt matter whos in and whos out.

    - Centuries from Arindam Das, Manoj Tiwary as hosts fight back           A STAFF REPORTER            Centurions Arindam Das (right) and Manoj Tiwary at Eden Gardens on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Bengal batsmen Thursday called the shots, raising hopes of overhauling Saurashtras 650 in their Ranji Trophy Elite group match at the Eden.         
	The hosts were 319 for two at close, needing another 331 from the 90 overs on the final day.         
	A first innings lead will fetch three crucial points that will keep hopes for a quarter final berth alive.         
	After adding 112 for the second wicket with Deep Dasgupta, Arindam Das teamed up with Manoj Tiwary to put together 196 in an unbroken third wicket partnership. At stumps, Arindam was batting on 136 with Tiwary on 102.         
	We are aiming for three points. Weve got to be positive, Tiwary said.         
	Saurashtra captain Jaydev Shah didnt sound too upbeat.         
	The onus is on Bengal. The ball is in their court and they have to decide whether to go for the chase, Shah said.         
	If the match isnt decided on the basis of first innings lead, no team will get any points unless the elements intervene.         
	Friday will certainly produce an exciting days play. Given the conditions it wont come as a surprise if Bengal put Saurashtra behind in the first innings.         
	For the record, Delhi had overhauled Karnatakas 705 in the 1981-82 Ranji Trophy final. Bengal coach Roger Binny was among the four centurions for Karnataka in that match.         
	Resuming at the overnight 27 for one, the Bengal batsmen needed to show character on the penultimate day and they were, in turn, helped by a pedestrian attack and a wicket that has played true from the opening day.         
	Caution was on Arindam and Deeps minds as they went about their task in the morning. They waited for the loose balls and concentrated on the ones and twos.         
	Deep seemed determined to get a big score but was dismissed with the third ball after lunch. Having done all the hard work, he was undone by a Ravindra Jadeja delivery that came in and held its line.         
	Not the best way to get dismissed and disappointment was writ large on his face. He spent 91 minutes for his 61, which included nine fours.         
	Arindam, who has been among runs this season, has justified the faith shown in him by the selectors. He was solid in his approach and never allowed the bowlers to get on top.         
	Except for a brief while after lunch, when Rakesh Dhruve and Sitangshu Kotak troubled him, he used his feet well against the spinners. He curtailed much of his ambitious strokeplaying and kept within the V. This was his fifth first-class century and he has already spent 416 minutes at the crease.         
	Tiwary, after coming in at a crucial juncture, batted according to the situation. Knowing well that a wicket at that stage would mean extra pressure, he batted responsibly and with authority.         
	The Boards Grade D contract has certainly acted as a motivation. The only blemish was when he nicked one between first slip and the wicket-keeper in the Nervous Nineties.         
	None of the Saurashtra bowlers had the pace or variation to be successful on this wicket. While the batsmen have had a field day so far, such wickets are proving to be the bowlers graveyard.         
	The wicket is not in my hands Its not result oriented, said Shah.

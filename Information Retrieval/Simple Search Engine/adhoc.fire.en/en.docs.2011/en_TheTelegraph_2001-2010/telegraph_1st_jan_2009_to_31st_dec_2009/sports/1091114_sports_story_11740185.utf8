The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rafa battles to win
                                                                                                                                     Rafa battles to win
                  Rafael Nadal on Thursday                     
	Paris: Rafael Nadal kept winning the hard way at the Paris Masters on Thursday, overcoming fellow Spaniard Tommy Robredo 6-3, 3-6, 7-5 to reach the quarter finals.         
	Nadal, who saved five match points before taming Nicolas Almagro in another all-Spanish battle on Wednesday, needed two hours and 20 minutes to shrug off a brave challenge from Robredo, seeded 14th in the indoor event.         
	I didnt play my best but I played better than yesterday and managed to play big rallies without making mistakes, so thats positive, Nadal said.         
	Robredo had his chances, serving for the match in the third set, leading 5-4, but Nadal lived up to his reputation as a fierce competitor to recover and seal victory.         
	Roger Federers second-round exit in the French capital on Wednesday means Nadal stands an outside chance of finishing the year as world No. 1.         
	Before contemplating that accolade he must beat defending Paris Masters champion Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, the world No. 9, who swept aside fellow Frenchman Gilles Simon 6-2, 6-3.         
	The conditions will be good for him with a fast court and the crowd on his side, Nadal said. He will be the favourite but Ill do my best.         
	France will have two players in the quarter finals for the first time since 1992 after 15th seed Gael Monfils posted a 6-4, 6-3 win over Julien Benneteau, who looked exhausted after his shock victory over Federer in the previous round.         
	Britains world No. 4 Andy Murray looked tired, too, when he lost 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 to Czech Radek Stepanek.         
	Despite having battled for over two hours to beat James Blake on Wednesday, finishing in the middle of the night, Murray started well against Stepanek, relying on his strong serve, but then collapsed, making many unforced errors.         
	Obviously, I was not at my best but I was not expecting to (be), Murray told reporters. It was four clock by the time I got to bed and thats not the ideal preparation for a match.         
	Stepanek now faces US Open champion Juan Martin del Potro, who moved past Chiles Fernando Gonzalez in dramatic, late action.         
	Gonzalez won the first set 7-6 and world No. 5 Del Potro had just won the second by the same score after surviving seven match points when the Chilean pulled out with a sore right knee.         
	Murray will now rest before going to London where he could meet Swede Robin Soderling, who kept alive his slim hopes of entering the year-end event by beating Russias Nikolay Davydenko 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.         
	Soderling goes on to meet world No. 3 Novak Djokovic, who cruised past Frenchman Arnaud Clement 6-2, 6-2 to reach the quarters in Paris for the first time.         
	Despite losing to Soderling, Davydenko qualified for the World Tour Finals in London. He became the seventh player to win a ticket to London. Fernando Verdasco, Soderling, and Tsonga are still in contention for the last remaining berth.

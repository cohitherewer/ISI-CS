The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Captain Clarke wins it for Australia
                                                   Captain Clarke wins it for Australia
                      
	Abu Dhabi: Michael Clarke hit a fighting half-century but Australia still managed just 198 for seven in their allotted 50 overs in the third day-night International against Pakistan Monday.               
	Australia won by 27 runs as Pakistan were all out for 171 in 47.1 overs               
	The 28-year-old right-handed batsman scored 66, adding 54 with Callum Ferguson (41) for the fifth wicket as Australia were made to struggle for runs after they won the toss and decided to bat on a flat Abu Dhabi Stadium wicket.         
	Clarke, who hit eight boundaries during his 93-ball knock, also added 46 for the third wicket with opener Brad Haddin (26) after Australia lost two early wickets with James Hopes (15) and Shane Watson (0).         
	Australia lost Hopes in the sixth over when he failed to beat a direct throw from Pakistan captain Younus Khan and was run out. Watson was bowled by Umar Gul off an inside edge.         
	Clarke and Haddin steadied the innings before Shoaib Malik removed Haddin, while leg-spinner Shahid Afridi had Andrew Symonds.           (AGENCIES)

                                                     Sarwan fights on for the West Indies
                  Ravi Bopara en route to his maiden Test century in Bridgetown on Friday                     
	Bridgetown: Off-spinner Graeme Swann claimed two wickets in the morning session Saturday on day three of the fourth cricket Test as the West Indies were restricted to 163 for three in response to Englands mammoth first innings total of 600 for six declared.               
	At midnight, the West Indies were 252 for three. Ramnaresh Sarwan (115) and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (56) were at the crease.               
	Swann grabbed two for 38 as the West Indies added 78 runs to their overnight total in the morning session for the loss of opener Devon Smith (55) and Ryan Hinds (15).         
	Ramnaresh Sarwan stroked a typically fluent, unbeaten 81 off 127 balls to lead the home teams resistance. The 28-year-old stroked 10 fours, all through the off side and most with sumptuous drives and cuts, along with one leg side six.         
	The experienced Shivnarine Chanderpaul was unbeaten on four at the interval.         
	Earlier, Sarwan and Smith extended their overnight partnership to 108 before Swann struck just before the drinks break.         
	Left-hander Smith, who resumed on 37, went on to make his first half century in 24 Test innings. But shortly afterwards he was ruled leg before wicket to Swann by umpire Aleem Dar. Smith called for a referral but TV umpire Daryl Harper saw no reason to overturn Dars decision.         
	Smith struck eight fours off 113 deliveries.         
	Sarwan, already with scores of 107, 94 and 106 in the series, brought up his half century in the days third over and went to lunch in sight of a 14th Test century.         
	Hinds fell just before the break as Swann gained another lbw verdict from Dar. Hinds, who hit two fours off 44 balls, wisely chose against a referral as he was out in similar fashion to Smith.         
	The West Indies still trail by 437 runs.           (AP)

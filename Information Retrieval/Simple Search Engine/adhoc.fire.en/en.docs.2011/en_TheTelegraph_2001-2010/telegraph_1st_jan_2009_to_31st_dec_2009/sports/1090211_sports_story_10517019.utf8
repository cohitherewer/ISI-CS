                                                   SA assured of top spot
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: New Zealands defeat against Australia in the fourth match on Tuesday assured South Africa of $175,000 as the Proteas now cannot be caught at the top of the ICC ODI Championship table before the cut-off date of April 1.         
	Prior to New Zealands match against Australia in Adelaide, only the Black Caps had the chance of overtaking the Proteas before the cut-off date.         
	The six-wicket defeat, however, means that even if Daniel Vettoris men were to win the remaining ODI in this series and then beat India 5-0 next month, they would still fall short of South Africas current rating of 125.         
	On the current schedule of ODIs, no other side can match South Africa and with the Proteas themselves not playing any match before April 1, they will not be budging from the rating they enjoy now.         
	 Apart from the cash, South Africa will also be presented the ICC Championship Shield.         
	However, both India and New Zealand have the opportunity to topple Australia from the second spot, depending on the result of the final ODI between the Aussies and New Zealand in Brisbane and then on the results of the five matches that follow between them.                 
	RANKINGS: 1. South Africa (125), 2. Australia (124), 3. India (120), 4. New Zealand (114), 5. Pakistan (111), 6. England (108), 7. Sri Lanka (105), 8. West Indies (91), 9. Bangladesh (46), 10. Zimbabwe (23), 11. Ireland (19), 12. Kenya (0).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Toss the ball... Hit the ball... Oops! Oops!
                                                     Toss the ball... Hit the ball... Oops! Oops!
            KAREN CROUSE            Dinara Safina                           
	The serve in tennis is the only shot completely in the players control, the one part of the script in every match in which the same person is director, writer and star. That has been little comfort to some of the top players in womens tennis, whose serving has bombed on the biggest stages this summer.         
	Case in point Dinara Safina. Although she won her first-round match at the US Open, she scattered 11 double faults throughout her three-set victory against Olivia Rogowska, including set point in the first-set tiebreaker.         
	Safina, a 23-year-old Russian seeking her fourth title of the year and the first Grand Slam championship of her career, recovered with help from Rogowska, an 18-year-old Australian with deep ground strokes and a thin rsum.         
	Cliff Drysdale, who was calling the match for a TV sports broadcaster, at one point said of Safina: Her mind is in the way. Shes just terrified.         
	Safina avoided becoming an ignominious footnote in history as the first top-ranked woman to lose in the first round at the Open in the modern era. Afterward, she told the fans in Arthur Ashe Stadium to serve as she says, not as she does. Please try to see your ball when you serve, she said, looking as if she wanted to exit stage left and keep on going all the way back to Moscow.         
	Between them, Safina and Rogowska collected 24 double faults in what is becoming a familiar script. In the final of a Womens Tennis Association event last month in Toronto, Elena Dementieva and Maria Sharapova, a former No. 1, combined for 17 double faults.         
	Sharapova, once the worlds No. 1, now has the dubious distinction of leading the tour in double faults with an average of 8.14 per match. Dementieva averages 5.4.         
	Assessing todays top women against their predecessors is difficult because the WTA, the governing body for womens professional tennis, has complete double-fault statistics for only the past two years, according to Kevin Fischer, a spokesman for the organisation.         
	Why does bad serving happen to great players?         
	Bob Thate, a former shooting coach for the Nets and a recreational tennis player, suspects he has the answer. He views free-throw shooters and servers as practitioners of essentially the same art  one more positivist than impressionist, its strokes predicated on rhythm and routine.         
	Theres a great correlation, he said. Youre not going up and down the court or side to side, youre standing at the line and 10,000 people are watching you hit the ball.         
	The serve and the free throw share key components: foot placement; body balance; weight shift; toss and follow through. Misses happen when players minds are willing but their mechanics are weak, or vice versa. Then theres Safina, who committed 17 double faults in an ugly loss in Toronto in her final Open tune-up and then said: Its not the serve. Its just my brain.         
	After enumerating the numerous flaws in her technique, Safina laughed ruefully and said, I know this, and Im still so stupid that I continue doing it.         
	Even the strongest athletes have minds fragile enough to form cracks through which doubts can seep. Roger Federer was bounced in Montreal, in his first tournament after winning his 15th Grand Slam singles title, when he double-faulted on match point in the quarter finals.         
	Sometimes when things go bad on the serve during a match, its hard to change them, Federer had said. You try to find what it is, if its the toss, is it the wind? Is it the swing? Are you going too fast in the beginning? But then youre asking yourself many questions, and the next thing you know youre not focusing about playing the baseline points anymore.         
	When she is struggling with her serve, Dementieva said, her mother tells her not to think about it. She finds the advice counterproductive, like telling a hungry dieter not to focus on food. Its easy to say, she said, but hard to do.         
	Holding serve tends to be much more of an adventure for the women than the men. As the TV sports analyst Mary Carillo explained, the womens game is predicated on power. You get tired, you get tight, you have nowhere to go, she said.         
	Kim Clijsters, a former No.1 who recently returned from a two-year retirement, hurried the follow through on her serve in her first-round victory against Viktoriya Kutuzova and racked up four double faults. I want to recover really quickly to get the return back because a lot of girls really like to step in now, she said. Im kind of already preparing myself for the next shot while I didnt even finish my serve yet.         
	Clijsters prepares to serve by bouncing the ball three times. Her husband, Brian Lynch, who played professional basketball in Belgium, did the same thing before every free throw attempt. Comparing the free throw and the serve in an email message, he wrote: Its the only shot where all eyes are on you, and nothing else around is happening. This is where the pressure comes in.         
	Professional tennis is not like the NBA, where a few teams have shooting coaches on the payroll. It is not like major league baseball, with its hitting coaches. On the WTA and ATP tours, there are no serving gurus.         
	Brad Gilbert, the analyst, said, Its probably the next wave.         
	Leave it to Serena Williams, the fashion conscious favourite on the womens side and arguably the best server on the tour, to identify her sports next trend. After her first-round win, she attended the news conference in a T-shirt with Aces emblazoned across her chest.           NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Youzhny, Schiavone lift titles in Moscow
                                                   Youzhny, Schiavone lift titles in Moscow
                      
	Moscow: Russias Mikhail Youzhny rallied to beat Janko Tipsarevic of Serbia 6-7(5-7), 6-0, 6-4 Sunday to win the Kremlin Cup, while Italian Francesca Schiavone won her second career title, beating Olga Govortsova of Belarus 6-3, 6-0 for the womens crown.         
	Youzhny did not drop a set on his way to a fifth career title and extended Russias title streak in the home event to six consecutive years since American Taylor Dent won here in 2003. The first set was a tough one for both of us, Youzhny said. But in the second set he appeared to be really tired after a tough doubles match he had played late on Saturday.         
	Tipsarevic, who had not lost a set on the way to his first ATP Tour final, said: Im obviously disappointed because Ive lost. But I think, I didnt lose today  Misha (Mikhail) beat me. He was a better player. Though the third set was 6-4, I was really struggling to win my service games, while he was winning his very easy.         
	The sixth seed Serb prevailed on the first-set tiebreaker, but the 30th-ranked Youzhny charged back, winning eight consecutive games to level at one set apiece and lead 2-0 in the decisive set. Tipsarevic saved four match points in the ninth game before Youzhny served for the match and sealed the win with a forehand crosscourt shot. It was Youznys first final in 11 appearances at the event. He is now 5-11 in ATP finals.         
	Schiavone is 2-10 in WTA Tour finals. She also won the 2007 Gastein Ladies.         
	The eighth seed Italian, the 2005 runner-up, broke decisively in the eighth game of the first set after Govortsova had saved five break points in the sixth game. Schiavone said that a break on the ninth deuce in the sixth game for a 4-2 lead was the key moment of the match.         
	The game was very long but I did very good, Schiavone said. Everything changed at that moment. When I found the way, it was much easier, and she (Govortsova) didnt know how to finish points, I think.         
	Govortsova broke back immediately, but Schiavone then won eight games in a row.

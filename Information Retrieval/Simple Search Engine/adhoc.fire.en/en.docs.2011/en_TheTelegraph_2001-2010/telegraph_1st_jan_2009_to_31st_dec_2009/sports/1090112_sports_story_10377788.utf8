Last year rsquo;s US Open champion was serving for the match at 6-5 and 30-30 in the second set when the chair umpire failed to notice an obvious let call when Williams rsquo;s serve hit the net and into the serving area on Stosur rsquo;s side of the net. Williams didn rsquo;t even bother to chase down Stosur rsquo;s return, believing it to be a certain let. Stosur was awarded the point and went on to break Williams and won the ensuing tiebreaker.

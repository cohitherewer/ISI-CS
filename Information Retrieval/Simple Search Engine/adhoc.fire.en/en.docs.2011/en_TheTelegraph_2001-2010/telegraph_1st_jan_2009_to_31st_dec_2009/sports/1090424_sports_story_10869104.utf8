The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yusuf breaks Knights hearts
                                                   Yusuf breaks Knights hearts
            A CORRESPONDENT                                  
	Yusuf Pathan broke the Indian Premier Leagues first tie and the Kolkata Knight Riders hearts in the Super Over at Newlands on Thursday. Sourav Ganguly struck form, but that wasnt enough as Yusufs pyrotechnics saw Rajasthan Royals win the thriller.         
	Set to score 151 against the Rajasthan Royals, the Knight Riders huffed and puffed before Sourav and Yashpal Singh added 49 in a crucial sixth-wicket partnership that almost saw them through. Needing seven off the last over, Sourav (46 off 30 balls, 4x4, 2x6) was caught behind off the penultimate delivery.         
	Two runs were needed off the last ball, but Ishant Sharma could manage only one as he was run out going for the second. That left the scores tied on 150.         
	The Super Over was forced into play to break the deadlock. Chris Gayle and Brendon McCullum managed 15 against Kamran Khan. Yusuf needed just four balls to reach the target against Ajantha Mendis.         
	Shane Warnes inspirational leadership gave the Rajasthan Royals a slight edge but the 16th over of the innings tilted the scales as Munaf Patel conceded 22 runs. Sourav hit the last two deliveries for huge sixes  one over deep square leg and the next over long off.         
	Once again, it was Gayle who gave the innings the early momentum. He continued his flurry of fours and sixes, picking Dmitri Mascarenhas for special treatment. Straight hits off the ground were followed by pulls and jabs that left the fielders bewildered. It seemed that no force would be able to stop him.         
	Warne, who believes in leading by example, finally got into the act luring the West Indies captain with a flighted delivery. Gayle, who hit two fours and four sixes for his 41 off 33 balls, got the timing wrong and Ravindra Jadeja, running across from long on, held on to the skier.         
	If the Rajasthan Royals tried to pull off a surprise by opening the bowling with Yusuf, the Knight Riders replied by sending in Laxmi Ratan Shukla at No.3 after the early dismissal of McCullum.         
	The Bengal captain, who was dropped on nought by wicketkeeper Mahesh Rawat, scratched around for his 13 off 13 balls before becoming Kamran Khans victim. Brad Hodge didnt last long, too.         
	Kamran, the 18-year-old left-arm pacer from Uttar Pradesh who is yet to play first-class cricket, bowled a superb spell in the middle overs to put the brakes on scoring. His action may not be to the purists liking but his pace and discipline kept the Knight Riders on a leash.         
	That was before Sourav and Yashpal Singh got together. Yashpal unnecessarily brought about his downfall, going for a slog in the 19th over when nudging into the gaps would have sufficed.         
	Earlier, Mendis struck two vital blows that pegged back the Rajasthan Royals.         
	The Sri Lanka spinner, who was drafted into the side after missing the first two matches, removed the dangerous looking Graeme Smith and Yusuf in his second over. The ball didnt turn big, but there were enough variations to trouble the batsmen who were looking to force the pace. He finished with figures of 4-0-19-2.         
	The start wasnt good for the Royals. They were reduced to 14 for two in the third over. Anureet Singh removed Paul Valthaty when the thick outside edge was taken by Ishant running from thirdman to deep point. Rob Quiney left in the next over, caught at first slip off Ishant.         
	Smith and Yusuf then wielded the long handle, adding 56 for the third wicket before the South African captain departed.         
	The ball clipped his pads in front of the stumps and lobbed low to Chris Gayle at first slip. Mendis went up for the leg before but Mark Benson ruled him caught after replays confirmed that he had edged the ball onto his pads.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wie recovers after early hiccups
                                                   Wie recovers after early hiccups
                      
	Rancho Mirage (California): American teenager Michelle Wie overcame a jittery start and erratic form off the tee with a red-hot putting display in Thursdays opening round of the Kraft Nabisco Championship.         
	The elegant Hawaiian, who has produced three top-10s in her four previous appearances at Mission Hills Country Club, birdied two of the last five holes for a one-under-par 71 in the first womens major of the year.         
	I was a little shaky at the beginning but I was able to calm myself and I made some good shots, Wie, 19, told reporters after ending the first round five shots behind pacesetting American Brittany Lincicome.         
	Asked whether she usually experienced nerves early in the round, she replied: No, not really. You always have the same jittery feeling when you play in the majors.         
	Wie, who covered her outward nine in one-over 37, hit nine fairways out of 14 on the day but limited the damage by totalling only 25 putts, including a 20-footer for birdie on her final hole.         
	Despite repeatedly pushing her tee shots to the right, she saved par on seven occasions by holing putts from between six and eight feet.         
	Thankfully those putts went in, said Wie, who tied for third here in 2006 before a lingering wrist injury prevented her from competing in 2007 and last year.

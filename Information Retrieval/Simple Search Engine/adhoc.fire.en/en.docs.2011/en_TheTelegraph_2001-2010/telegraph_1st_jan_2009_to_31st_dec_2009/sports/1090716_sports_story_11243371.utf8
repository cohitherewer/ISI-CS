The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kapil Dev: Dont see why I should bow before BCCI
                                                     Kapil Dev: Dont see why I should bow before BCCI
    - world cup-winning captain wasnt invited for 2011 logo unveiling function           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Kapil Dev                                 
	Calcutta: Some of Kapil Devs closest friends, like Madan Lal, Ashok Malhotra and Bharat Reddy, have turned their backs on the Indian Cricket League (ICL) and rejoined mainstream cricket, but Indias only (50-over) World Cup-winning captain doesnt intend bowing before the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).         
	I dont think Ive done anything wrong I didnt leave the BCCI either Having done no wrong, I dont see why I (too) should bow before the BCCI I dont wish to beg for forgiveness, Kapil, the ICL chairman, told The Telegraph from New Delhi.         
	Last month, the BCCI granted amnesty to 79 current cricketers, 11 former India players and 11 from the support staff category.         
	That effectively killed the Zee-promoted ICL, started two years ago, incidentally, before the Indian Premier League (IPL) was launched.         
	Look, on paper at least, the ICL still exists Im not hurt that so many have gone back to the BCCIs fold Its a question of their future and if somebody, for example, wants to play for the country, then who are we to stop him? But, yes, they had been intimidated         
	I know the list of those whove returned to the BCCI includes some very dear friends, but I dont hold any grudges Friendship is on one level, but when it comes to looking after ones financial well-being, then thats something else Woh apni jagah par hai, Kapil added.         
	Perhaps, its worth recalling what he said at an ICL function soon after its launch: Those whove joined us have shown so much courage. When I was their age, I didnt have that courage, didnt have their confidence         
	But, then, it was never a level playing field for the ICL and the BCCIs hostility kept growing by the day. As did its support for the IPL, the official T20 hungama.         
	Amazingly, Kapil wasnt invited to the unveiling of the 2011 World Cup logo in Mumbai on Tuesday. Its an International Cricket Council (ICC) tournament being hosted by, among others in the region, India.         
	However, two members of the history-scripting 1983 squad  Dilip Vengsarkar and Balwinder Singh Sandhu  were present. The former has always been part of mainstream cricket, while Sandhu is among those granted amnesty by the BCCI.         
	Obviously, for the BCCI, Kapil remains rebel No.1 and, keeping the venue in mind, the ICC chose to be politically correct. It did use Kapils quotes in a media release, though.         
	Even if the powers-that-be shun Kapil (and it will be interesting to see for how long), his achievements cant be struck off the record books.

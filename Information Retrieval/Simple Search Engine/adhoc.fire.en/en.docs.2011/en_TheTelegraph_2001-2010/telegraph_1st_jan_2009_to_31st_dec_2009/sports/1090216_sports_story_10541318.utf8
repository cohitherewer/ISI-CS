                                                   Mahelas advice for Mendis
                      
	Karachi: After the recent thrashing against India, mystery spinner Ajantha Mendis needs to work on reading the batsmens mind to regain his lost spark, believes Sri Lankas outgoing skipper Mahela Jayawardene.         
	India is one of the top sides today and they played very well against us. We have played them a lot in recent times and I think they played Mendis very capably, Jayawardene said on Sunday after arriving here for a two-Test series against Pakistan.         
	He now has to realise that the surprise element is out and he now has to become a much smarter bowler and come up with new tricks and learn to read the mind of the batsmen. He has got Muralitharan with him who is a very good teacher, he added.         
	Jayawardene once again side-stepped queries on who his successor would be when he steps down after the Pakistan series. ...I think the final decision is with the selectors, he said.         
	Jayawardene also said that his resignation would allow the new captain ample time to put his plans in place.         
	Jayawardene rejected suggestions that the one-day series loss against India would have any bearing on the Test series against Pakistan.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Antenor may do the trick
                                                                                                               Antenor may do the trick 
            STAR RACER                                    
	Calcutta: Competition is going to be tough in Fridays race card featuring the 2,000m Hyderabad Race Club Cup for horses in the upper classes. The prime contenders in the six-horse field are Compton Star, Antenor, Storming Success and Azureus who had crossed swords in the RWITC Cup a fortnight ago. Storming Success won that race but Antenor and Compton Star, who finished close behind, had gone through troubled galloping room. More importantly, Antenor was also given a poor ride by Neeraj Rawal. C. Alford rides the H. S. Bath-trainee now and the horse deserves another chance.

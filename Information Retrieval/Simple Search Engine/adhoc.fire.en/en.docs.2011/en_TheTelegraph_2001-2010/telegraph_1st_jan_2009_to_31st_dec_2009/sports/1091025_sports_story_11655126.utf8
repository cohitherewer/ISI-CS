The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Antonios all set to strike
                                                                                                               Antonios all set to strike
            OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT      
	The Mumbai-challenger Antonios gets another chance to show his mettle when the Glory Of Dancer-Twin Star colt takes on five rivals in the 2,400m Indian Turf Invitation Cup, the star attraction in the Hyderabad race card on Sunday. The winners stake in the race is a whopping Rs 60 lakh, plus a trophy valued at Rs One lakh.          
	Antonios had joined the big league, following his easy victory over Set Alight  a filly who hadnt tasted defeat till she lined up for the Indian Derby (Mumbai). Antonios subsequent performance confirms his mettle and also makes the prized colt an unbeatable proposition in Sundays races. Jockey P. Kamlesh partners the horse.          
	The Invitational races were originally scheduled for early March in Mumbai, but the outbreak of equine influenza in RWITC jeopardised the entire programme. With the Hyderabad Race Club (HRC) volunteering to hold the premium event in view of maintaining the continuity, the event is being staged. The club has, however, packaged the two-day Invitational programme into a single day, listing all the invitational races.

	Perth: Simon Katich missed a well deserve century by one run as Australia were 339 for three at the end of Day I of the final Test against the West Indies here on Wednesday.         
	According to cricinfo.com, Shane Watson (89) also fell 11-run short of his century as the Australians dominated the day all through against the visitors.         
	Michael Hussey with a brilliant 81 and Marcus North (23) were at the crease.         
	But the Aussies greatest concerned will be captain Ricky Pontings left-elbow injury that forced him to walk off the field at a score of 23. Though the 34-year old Ponting was later cleared by x-rays, it was learnt that the captain will bat when required.         
	Kemar Roach provided the West Indies with the early breakthrough.

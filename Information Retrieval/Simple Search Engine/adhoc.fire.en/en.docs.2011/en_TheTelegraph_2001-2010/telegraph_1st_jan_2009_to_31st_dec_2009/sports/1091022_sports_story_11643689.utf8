            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Shoaib Malik                           
	Calcutta: Former captain Shoaib Maliks outburst, directed at successor Younis Khan, after the recent Champions Trophy has made the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) draft a new Code of Conduct.         
	The Code will have to be signed by all the players before the team departs for the engagements against New Zealand.         
	Among other things, they will be barred from publicly commenting on matters relating to the PCB and the team.         
	Ejaz Butt, the PCB chairman, has gone on record saying that the new Code would have to be strictly followed.         
	For obvious reasons, the captain will be treated differently.         
	Malik, it may be recalled, criticised Younis for changing his position in the batting order from No.4 to No.3, in the semi-final, against New Zealand.         
	The former captains point was that hed got a match-winning hundred (128) against India at No.4 and batted in the same position against Australia (scoring 27). There was, therefore, no need for a change.         
	Malik managed just two at No.3 and his failure had a telling effect. Eventually, Pakistan lost the semi-final by five wickets.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Maliks outburst led to his being asked to show cause, but he hadnt replied till late on Wednesday.         
	Three-figure knocks against India count for much, which is probably why Malik is taking it easy.         
	Its to be seen whether the former captain is compelled to reply before the selectors pick the players for the upcoming ODIs, T20 Internationals and Tests.

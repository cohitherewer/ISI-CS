	Calcutta: Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) officials on Sunday squashed reports that Australian David Hussey will be unavailable for the second edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	Were confident that David will be available for the IPL this season. He never said that he will be unavailable, a KKR official said.         
	The official said that the franchise werent thinking about a replacement at the moment. He is in constant touch with adviser-in-charge John Buchanan. There is nothing to worry about him, the official said.         
	David had revealed on Saturday that he could follow Australia captain Ricky Ponting and stay away from the second season of the IPL.         
	Im sort of hoping to be playing in the one-dayers against South Africa and against Pakistan. Maybe a two-week window in the IPL Im not really sure at the moment. I have to see how the body is holding up, David was quoted as saying by a website.         
	I desperately want to be part of the Ashes squad. Im hoping to finish off the Shield season in good form and get an Ashes berth David, a regular in Australias ODI and Twenty20 squad, said.

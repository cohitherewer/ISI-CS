The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vaughan backs Trescothick
                                                   Vaughan backs Trescothick
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Former England captain Michael Vaughan believes Marcus Trescothick will continue to be one of county crickets most devastating domestic performers despite the reoccurrence of his stress-related illness.         
	Together the pair formed one of Englands most successful opening partnerships in recent memory and Vaughan, who remains close friends with the Somerset batsman, does not think his early departure from the Champions League in India will have any impact on his domestic form.         
	Trescothick, who has agreed to take over the countys captaincy from Justin Langer in 2010, was first troubled by the illness on Englands tour of India in 2005-06 and then quit the following winters Ashes trip just two weeks after leaving home.         
	It eventually forced him into international retirement, but a set of special measures put in place by Somerset had led to hopes he could spearhead their drive for success in the lucrative Twenty20 league.         
	Vaughan said: Marcus deserves a huge amount of credit, it was a courageous decision for him even to try and go there to play.         
	Its obviously not worked out but I spoke to him and hes fine. Its not the first time this has happened but at least hes given it a go.         
	I didnt speak to him about the details, I just called to make sure he was alright. It was obviously bad enough for him to come home and he knows what his own limits are.         
	I dont think people realise what an effort it took for him even to go out there. But Tres loves his cricket and hell be back next year, no doubt about it.         
	He will certainly be back next season playing for Somerset and full of runs, just like he was this year.         
	Vaughan acknowledges that the touring commitments placed on the top international players are intense but, with the growing influence of cash-rich Twenty20 competitions like the Champions League allied to the ever-growing ICC schedules, he does not believe there is a respite in sight.         
	Marcus is obviously a very public situation and how many other players are going through that I dont know.         
	But touring is part of a cricketers life and playing cricket is a wonderful experience. I was fortunate enough to do it and experience that for 10 years. Now, with the Champions League and and the IPL, players will probably have to travel more rather than less. It is tough at times but it is also a wonderful living.         
	Somerset chairman Andy Nash, who also spoke to the 33 year-old, was heartened to find Trescothick in good spirits         
	He is fine. He sounds like normal Marcus, down to earth and grounded, Nash said.         
	He also confirmed Somerset are full of gratitude for Trescothicks attempts to beat his fears.         
	Everyone connected with the club and cricket is aware how brave it was of him and [his wife] Hayley to even travel out there in the first place. This is not a step back for Marcus. It was a victory for him to get there. We are full of admiration for what he has done for us. We are looking forward to him being a highly successful captain for us from next season.

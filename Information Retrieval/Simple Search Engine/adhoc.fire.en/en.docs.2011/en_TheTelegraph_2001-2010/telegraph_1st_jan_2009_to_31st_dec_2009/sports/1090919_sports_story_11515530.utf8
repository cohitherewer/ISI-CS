	Nottingham: England captain Andrew Strauss told his players to show character after a 111-run thrashing by Australia here left them on the brink of a 0-7 series loss.         
	No side has ever lost a bilateral one-day International campaign by that margin. But a sixth straight defeat against world champions Australia meant England faced the prospect of making unwanted history in Sundays climax at the Riverside.         
	Six-nil is bad enough to be honest, Strauss said, after England were beaten for the second time in three days under the Trent Bridge floodlights Thursday.         
	Weve got one more opportunity (this series) to show our calibre as a side. We need to take that opportunity.         
	England, set 297 to win after Australia made 296 for eight, featuring a maiden ODI century from wicket-keeper batsman Tim Paine, were bowled out for 187 with nine overs to spare, with only No.8 Tim Bresnan, going past 30.         
	Englands top order failed once again, although Strauss, the hosts best batsman in this series, did appear unlucky to be given out caught behind for a second-ball nought. But the left-handed opener said his dismissal was no excuse for another batting horror show that shattered Englands already dented confidence ahead of the Champions Trophy.         
	It was a bit of a horror show with the bat, Strauss said. No one is more frustrated than me.         
	Strauss, booed by angry spectators during the post-match presentation ceremony, remarked: We were never in the hunt with the bat. So I can understand the frustration of the crowd. Im not going to sit here and make any excuses. What we have shown so far in this series hasnt been good enough, far from it. As a group of players, and as individuals, we need to stand up and show some character now. Its as simple as that.         
	Its been damaging for the one-day unit because confidence has become increasingly frail, he added.         
	However, Strauss insisted England could regroup in time for Sundays match and the Champions Trophy. Recalling how England won the one-daytournament on their last tour of Australia, Strauss said: Its not impossible to get back. I remember in Australia, in 2006/07, we were in a similar state and Paul Collingwood got a couple of hundreds and things turned around. Its a very simple process.

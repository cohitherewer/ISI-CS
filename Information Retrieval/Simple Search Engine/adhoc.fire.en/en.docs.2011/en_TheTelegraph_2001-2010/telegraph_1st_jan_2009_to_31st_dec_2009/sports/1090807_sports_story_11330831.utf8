                                                   CRICKET BRIEFS
                      
	PCB seeks legal advice   
	Lahore: The Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ejaz Butt said on Thursday that he was taking legal advice on how to tackle accusations of match fixing as suspicion fell on the national team after suffering crushing defeats in Sri Lanka.  
	We are discussing the matter with our lawyers on how some senior players came up with allegations without any proof. This is not on and not acceptable, Butt said.               
	Vettori view   
	Colombo: New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori is confident that his team has the talent to compete with the likes of Sri Lanka and India in their upcoming Test and ODI series, saying the only thing his squad lacks is experience. We have not played a lot of Test cricket and so our performances havent been as good as they should be, Vettori said.  
	Sehwag aim   
	Calcutta: India opener Virender Sehwag says his penchant to hit big centuries in Tests was driven by critics doubting his calibre in the longer version of the game. In Test matches Im very cautious. I want to score more runs and want to prove everyone wrong, he said.  
	Srinath point
    
	New Delhi: Former India pacer Jawagal Srinath has warned against the launch of a local franchise Twenty20 league, saying it could kill young talent. Dont make these kids professional T20 players at the age of 17. Money at this stage is difficult to handle, he said.  
	BCCI pensions
    
	Mumbai: Ex-cricketers who have severed their links with the rebel Indian Cricket League, including former captain Ajit Wadekar, have started to get their monthly pensions from the BCCI which had been stopped.  
	Butcher retires
    
	London: Former England batsman Mark Butcher has retired from first-class cricket due to knee problems. The Surrey captain had been struggling with a knee injury throughout the season and had surgery last month. The 36-year-old Butcher played 71 Tests for England.

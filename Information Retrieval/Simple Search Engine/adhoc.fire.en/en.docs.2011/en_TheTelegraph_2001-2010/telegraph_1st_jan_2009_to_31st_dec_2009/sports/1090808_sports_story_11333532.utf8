                                                     Jayanta clinches spot for finals
            A STAFF REPORTER            Talukdar                           
	Calcutta: Jayanta Talukdar, on Friday, qualified for the finals to be held in Copenhagen on September 26, despite an early exit from the World Cup archery (Stage IV) in Shanghai.         
	Otherwise, it was a disappointing day for the Indians in the individual recurve section. Nobody went past the pre-quarter finals.         
	Talukdar, winner of the second leg of the four-leg World Cup series in Porec, accumulated 45 points to qualify ahead of Simon Terry of Great Britain (43) and Romain Girouille of France (36).         
	This is the second entry for Talukdar to the finals of World Cup. He had qualified for the 2006 finals where he finished last. Dola Banerjee was the first Indian to win the prestigious title in 2007 in Dubai.

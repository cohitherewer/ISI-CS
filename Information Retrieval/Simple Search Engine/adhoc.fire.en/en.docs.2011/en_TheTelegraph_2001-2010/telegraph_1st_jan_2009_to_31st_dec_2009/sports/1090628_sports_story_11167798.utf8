The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kapur tied 11th, Randhawa out 
                                                   Kapur tied 11th, Randhawa out 
                      
	Munich: Shiv Kapur zoomed to the tied 11th spot with a six-under 66 but Jyoti Randhawa missed the cut by just one stroke despite an improved 69 in the second round of the BMW International Open golf tournament on Friday.         
	Kapur, who was languishing at the tied 63rd spot overnight, reeled off seven birdies against a lone bogey to total seven-under 137.         
	Randhawa, meanwhile, totalled two-under 142 but couldnt make the cut which came at three-under. The other Indian in fray, S.S.P Chowrasia, turned in a modest two-under 70 to make the cut with a total of five-under. Chowrasia was tied 27th.         
	Kapur played out a flawless front-nine stroking birdies on the first and sixth to make the turn two-under.         
	The Delhi-pros back-nine started with a bogey but he soon made amends with a hat-trick of birdies from 11th to 13th before gaining two more shots to end the day on a high.         
	Retief Goosen was plagued by insects during his second round of four-under 68 but they did not bug him enough to stop the South African clinging on to a one-shot advantage on Friday.         
	First round front-runner Goosen moved to 12-under-par 132, a stroke ahead of Denmarks Soren Kjeldsen, who produced an eagle and five birdies during his second round 65 to nearly catch the two times US Open champion. Britons David Drysdale, who matched Goosens 64 of the previous day and Nick Dougherty, who carded a 65, were on 10-under.         
	Goosen could not repeat his fast start of the first round and said he had a reason. I got a bit carried away by bugs, he told reporters.         
	I was wearing a green shirt and thats not normally their favourite colour but it was this time. It was scary. The way they were swarming I couldnt see the ball.

  -Final test: Youngsters disappointed after missing out on maiden centuries         OUR CORRESPONDENT            Murali Vijay after his dismissal, in Mumbai, on Thursday. (Reuters)                                   
	Mumbai: Murali Vijay Thursday rued missing out on the century but hoped that his more illustrious opening partner, Virender Sehwag, would get a 400 in the third and final Test.               
	The following are excerpts               
	His dismissal         
	I think it was a bad shot in that situation. I missed out on a hundred got out at the wrong time.         
	Coming in for Gautam Gambhir         
	Gautam and Sehwag have been playing really well. It was a good opportunity for me. I have been doing really well so I just wanted to go out and give my best.         
	Partnering Sehwag         
	It takes pressure off you basically because, if you play normal cricket with Sehwag around, you get runs. He always keeps you in a calm state of mind. In a lot of ways, he helps me out.         
	Sehwags knock         
	It was a fantastic innings. You learn a lot by watching him play. Its really great and no words are enough to describe this great knock. I hope he carries on and gets 400.         
	Sehwags advise to him before the innings         
	To just go out and enjoy.         
	A permanent slot in the team         
	Performing for India is the ultimate dream and I am living it right now. Obviously, I will get my turn. They (Sehwag and Gambhir) are playing very well and I hope they continue the same way. Whenever I get an opportunity Ive just got to be prepared.         
	Facing Murali         
	I played a lot against him in the IPL. I know he is a great bowler and I just went out looking to play positively.

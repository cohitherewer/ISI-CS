The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Liverpool look for inspiration

	London: Liverpool have a few reasons to believe they can score at least three goals at Chelsea on Tuesday to overturn a 3-1 deficit and reach the Champions League semi-finals for the fourth time in five seasons.         
	The Reds have already ended Chelseas 86-match unbeaten home streak this season and completed a Premier League double over the London club for the first time in 19 years.         
	Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez will also be encouraged by Chelsea conceding three goals in 11 minutes after leading Bolton 4-0 on Saturday. The Blues clung on to win the league match but that was with captain John Terry, who is suspended for the second leg at Stamford Bridge.         
	Benitez, who won the 2005 Champions League in his first season at Liverpool, hopes to have captain Steven Gerrard in the team. The England midfielder, who is the Reds top scorer this season, has been responding well to treatment on a groin injury.         
	Obviously we do not want him to break down again  he could then be out for 10 to 16 days  but the injury is not a massive one. It will be a calculated gamble to play him but one that I will consider, Benitez said on Monday. It makes a difference if we play with him. Clearly we need him, he is a key player for us. Everything can change if he can play and if he plays well.         
	Chelsea manager Gus Hiddink is concerned about the threat posed by Gerrard working in tandem with striker Fernando Torres.         
	No doubt he is very important but you have seen Torres also how important he was in the first goal (at Anfield)  Gerrard was not involved in this goal, except he was penetrating just before the goal, Hiddink said.         
	Chelsea, who have never lost a European clash after taking a first-leg advantage back to Stamford Bridge, eliminated Liverpool at home in last seasons semi-finals before losing to Manchester United on penalties in the final.         
	But Hiddink only has to look back at how Liverpool won their fifth European Cup in 2005 to see the potential for a comeback.         
	The Reds were trailing 3-0 at halftime to AC Milan in Istanbul, but scored three times in the second half to take the final into extra time and a triumphant penalty shootout.         
	That is why we are saying we have to be very careful, Hiddink said. We are not just saying that to be polite, it is fact. Of course we are in a good position, but if we think we can manage it easily then we have lost before the game.         
	Liverpool have also recently managed to score four goals against Real Madrid, Manchester United and Blackburn, and hit five against Aston Villa. I believe the team can score three goals at Chelsea, although it is very difficult because they are a strong team, Torres said.         
	We can do it. We have confidence, we know we can win the game and we will not panic if we do concede one there, if we score three then it goes to extra time. We won away to Manchester United, they scored but we still won 4-1. Chelsea could just defend, but I doubt that. They will want to score themselves and that will give us a chance ourselves.

                                                   Jeev Milkha signs off tied 39th
                      
	Pacific Palisades (California): Jeev Milkha Singh finished tied 39th after signing off with a sedate two-under 69 at the Northern Trust Open golf tournament here. Jeev sank four birdies against a couple of bogeys to end with an aggregate of five-under 279 at the Riviera Country Club.         
	Daniel Chopra (288) finished tied 72nd. Playing his back nine first, Jeev started with a string of pars before hitting a birdie brace before dropping a stroke on the 18th hole. The other nine had a similar story to tell as Jeev birdied the first and fifth holes with a bogey in between on the fourth to settle for a card of 69.         
	Phil Mickelson squandered a five-stroke lead before coming from two behind with three holes remaining to win the Northern Trust Open by a shot on Sunday.         
	The American left-hander, who hit only nine of 14 fairways and reached just nine of 18 greens in regulation, birdied 16 and 17 before parring the last to complete a successful title defence at riviera country club.         
	Mickelson, who had charged four ahead of the chasing pack with a blistering 62 on saturday, clinched his 35th PGA Tour victory with a 15-under total of 269.         
	American Steve Stricker, two shots ahead with two holes to play, had to settle for second place after bogeying the final hole for a 67.         
	PGA Tour veteran Fred Couples, champion here in 1990 and 1992, carded a 69 to finish at 13 under in a tie for third with Argentinas Andres Romero (70) and South Korean K.J. Choi (69).         
	Im pleased to be sitting here as the champion, Mickelson told reporters after earning the winners cheque for $1.134 million. It was not easy. The good thing was that I was able to fight hard, and fight through the round.

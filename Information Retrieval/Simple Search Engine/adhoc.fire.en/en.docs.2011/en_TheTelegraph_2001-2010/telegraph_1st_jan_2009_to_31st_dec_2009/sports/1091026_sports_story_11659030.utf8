            OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT                            
	Trainer Bezan Chenoys Autonomy upset the applecart of the hot favourite Antonios in the 2,400m Indian Turf Invitation Cup, held in Hyderabad on Sunday. It was definitely Antonios race until the horses jockey P. Kamlesh literally presented it on a salver to his fellow-professional, Y.S. Srinath. Kamlesh wilted under pressure, after being in commanding lead in the last furlong of the race.          
	The 1,200m Sprinters Cup and the 3000m Stayers Cup were, however, won by the deserving contenders  Oasis Star and Yana, respectively.

            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                      
	Ahmedabad: What was to be Sachin Tendulkars party turned into a run-fest for Rahul Dravid and Mahendra Singh Dhoni on the opening day of the first Test of the Jaypee Cup.         
	A day after completing 20 years in international cricket, Sachin fell for a mere four runs, but the middle-order ensured India finished the day on a commendable 385 for six, their best ever on the first day of a Test         
	Dravids 27th Test century gave the innings stability and direction, but it was his partnerships with Yuvraj Singh and Dhoni (110) that undid all the good work by the Sri Lankan opening bowlers.         
	It can be argued that the pre-match hype had probably left Sachin with little time to concentrate on the Test, but theres no denying that Chanaka Welegedara deceived him with a beauty.         
	The 28-year-old left-arm pacer  in the mould of Chaminda Vaas and playing only in his second Test  along with Damika Prasad, reduced the Indian top-order to tatters during a 42-minute burst in the morning.         
	Welegedara (7-2-28-3) did the most damage in a dream spell with the batsmen struggling against his in-swingers at robust pace. Dhonis decision to bat seemed unjustified as Welegedara sent shivers down the spine.         
	Gautam Gambhir was bowled off the inside edge, and Virender Sehwag attacked for a while before Welegedara produced the perfect in-swinger to trap him in front.         
	At 27 for two and 34 minutes after the start, the stage was set for Sachin Tendulkar to make the occasion memorable. If the new Gujarat Cricket Association regime, under Narendra Modi, had hoped Sachins batting would fill the almost empty stands on Monday morning, they were in for a rude shock.         
	A perfect drive between cover and point, that met no obstacle, marked his arrival at the crease. The second ball was left alone. Expectations grew.         
	The next one, though, proved fatal. Welegedara had the icon all squared up as he found the gap between his bat and pad with one that slightly held its line.         
	 A dream lay shattered and all the preparations for another grand felicitation had come to a nought. Despair was writ large and not just on Sachins face.         
	Damika made his presence felt in the next over as V.V.S. Laxman dragged one onto his stumps after being done in by inward movement.         
	At 32 for four, it seemed the opening session blues at Motera  India were shot out for 76 against South Africa in the last Test here  had struck the hosts batting again.         
	But Dravid and Yuvraj held fort during a 125 run partnership (off 173 balls) for the fifth wicket. Unnerved by the circumstances, they went about the task in their own natural way and with positive intent.         
	Once they realised there was no demon in the wicket, there was no stopping the pair. The late introduction of Muttiah Muralidharan only made their task easier.         
	Determination and focus, with perfect timing, was the hallmark of Dravids chanceless unbeaten 177. Seldom has one seen him bat with such fluency and authority in the recent past. Scoring more runs than he ever has in a days play, the former India captain crossed 11,000 runs, and in the process, became the fifth highest run-getter in Tests.         
	No doubt, then, that Dravid proved a few things along the way.         
	The clenched fist pointing towards the dressing room, even before the 100th run had been completed, was meaningful. He outscored Yuvraj (68 off 93 balls, 13x4) and matched Dhoni run for run during their 224-run sixth wicket stand. Dravid set the pace of things to follow with three fours in one Welegedara over after lunch.         
	That 110 of Dravids runs came from boundaries and a six, off only 251 balls during 374 minutes at the crease, is ample proof of his acceleration.         
	 A typical example of Dravids skill and temperament, this innings will certainly rank among his very best.         
	Yuvraj lived dangerously on a couple of occasions but showed the resolve to stay put. In contrast, Dhonis second century in Tests was achieved through some intelligent use of feet against the spinners. He ran the singles hard and forced the Lankans to make mistakes on the field.         
	As Sangakkara was forced to employ a pre-dominantly singles saving field to stop Dhoni, Dravid used it to get the boundaries at will. Not surprising then that Dhoni had only ten boundaries and a six during his 200-minute stay.

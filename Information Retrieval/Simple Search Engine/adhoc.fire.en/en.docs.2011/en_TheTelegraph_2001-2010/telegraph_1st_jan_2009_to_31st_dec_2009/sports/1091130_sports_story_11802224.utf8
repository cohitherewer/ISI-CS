The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ibrahimovic does it for Barcelona 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ibrahimovic does it for Barcelona 
                      
	Barcelona: Zlatan Ibrahimovic came off the bench to volley 10-man Barcelona to a 1-0 home victory over Real Madrid on Sunday which put them back on top of La Liga.         
	Cristiano Ronaldo missed the clearest chance of a first half in which the visitors successfully frustrated Barca before substitute Ibrahimovic made the breakthrough by smashing a volley past Iker Casillas in the 56th minute.         
	Shortly afterwards, Barca midfielder Sergio Busquets foolishly picked up his second yellow card to leave his side a man short for almost 30 minutes.         
	But Real could not make the extra man count in a pulsating finish and it needed a superb save from Casillas to deny Lionel Messi at the end. Real had Lassana Diarra sent off in the 89th minute. Barcelona have 30 points from 12 games, two ahead of Real who slipped back to second.         
	On Saturday, Sevilla striker Luis Fabiano scored twice in the second-half to give his side a 2-2 draw at home to struggling Malaga.         
	The visitors, who started the day bottom and without a win in 12 consecutive matches in all competitions, had taken a surprise 2-0 first-half lead through Fernando and Duda.         
	Malaga climbed off the foot of La Liga and moved up to 17th.         
	Valencia conceded a late penalty to be held 1-1 at home by Real Mallorca. They are fourth with 25 points.         
	Earlier, Villarreal goalkeeper Diego Lopez kept out two penalties against Sporting Gijon but could not prevent his side slipping to a 1-0 defeat.           (REUTERS)

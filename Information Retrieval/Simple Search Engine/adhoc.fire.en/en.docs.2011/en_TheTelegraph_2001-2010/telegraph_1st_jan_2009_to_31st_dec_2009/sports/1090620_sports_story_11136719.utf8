The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lanka set up Pakistan date
                                                     Lanka set up Pakistan date
                                    
	London: Tillekaratne Dilshan prolonged his purple patch with a sublime unbeaten 96 as Sri Lanka overcame a mid-innings collapse to post 158 for five against the West Indies in the second semi-final of the World Twenty20 here on Friday.               
	Sri Lanka will face Pakistan in the final of the World Twenty20. In the semi-final, they beat the West Indies by 57 runs. The West Indies, chasing 159, were bundled out for 101.         
	Captain Chris Gayle staged a lone battle scoring an unbeaten 63 off 50 balls as none of the other West Indies batsmen could reach double figures. Sri Lanka pacer Angelo Mathews, who represented the Kolkata Knight Riders in the second edition of the Indian Premier League, rocked the Windies in the first over of the innings claiming three wickets.         
	Muttiah Muralidharan bagged three while Ajantha Mendis claimed two               
	Dilshans unbeaten 57-ball knock, bejewelled with two sixes and 12 fours, was the cornerstone of the Lankan innings as the right-hander went on to eclipse Jacques Kallis as the leading scorer in the tournament.         
	Dilshans knock was not only the highest individual score of the tournament but also the highest by a Lankan in a Twenty20 International.         
	Incidentally, with the ball not exactly coming to the bat as they would have liked, Sri Lanka had a rather quiet start after the West Indies captain Chris Gayle put them in.         
	Sanath Jayasuriya struggled to time the ball as Dilshan, clearly the more fluent of the duo, did not get enough strike.         
	Jayasuriya hit Darren Sammy and Suleiman Benn for boundaries but still could not find the meat of the bat and even changing the willow did not help.         
	The veteran Sri Lankan managed to score 24 off 37 balls hitting only 3 boundaries during his stay at the crease.         
	Dilshan, however, looked in silken touch and could not be stymied.         
	He tickled a Jerome Taylor delivery over the wicketkeeper for a four and paddled the next one, a low full toss, for a stunning six to break free.         
	Dwayne Bravo did not go unscathed either as Dilshan hit him for three fours in the same over.         
	He edged Chris Gayle for a four and followed it up with a slog-sweep to send the ball into the stands behind the mid-wicket region.         
	Sri Lanka had cruised to 73 runs without loss at the midway stage when Bravo triggered a batting collapse that left the Lankans reeling at 77 for three.         
	Jayasuriya hit Bravos third ball of the over straight to Taylor and two balls later, Kieron Pollard took a blinder to return Kumar Sangakkara for a duck.         
	Pollard then returned to remove Mahela Jayawardene (2) and suddenly Sri Lanka found themselves staring at abyss.         
	Not that it had much of an effect on Dilshan who kept hitting his big shots to bolster Lankas case. The innings found some vital momentum in the 17th over when Bravo was taken for 18 as he struggled to find his length. Dilshan cracked three boundaries and Silva then joined in when he swung the final delivery one bounce to the square-leg rope.         
	Silvas contribution to a stand of 50 in six overs was just 11 before he fell trying to reverse hit Benn.         
	In the penultimate over, Darren Sammy produced an excellent diving catch to dismiss Jehan Mubarak (7) off Taylor. Dilshan went into the final over on 91 and hit three from the first two legitimate deliveries.         
	Angelo Mathews hit a six, then a four, leaving Dilshan needing a six from the last delivery to score a century.         
	He hit Gayle to long off but could only scramble two.                 (AGENCIES)

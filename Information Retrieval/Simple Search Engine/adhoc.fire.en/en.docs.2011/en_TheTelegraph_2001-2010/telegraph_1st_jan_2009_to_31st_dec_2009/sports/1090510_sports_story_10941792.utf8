                                                   Need to win all games to qualify for semis: Sachin
                      
	East London: The Mumbai Indians, aware that another defeat will bring their semi-final hopes crashing, are desperate for a victory in the crucial Indian Premier League (IPL) match against the Royal Challengers Bangalore at Port Elizabeth on Sunday.         
	With only three wins out of nine matches, the Mumbai Indians find themselves at a lowly seventh spot in the IPL points table, and captain Sachin Tendulkar admitted that from here on, his side will have to win all their remaining matches to be in the fray for the semi-finals.         
	Mumbai Indians slumped to their third consecutive defeat last night when the Delhi DareDevils humiliated them by seven wickets here and the master blaster said that not putting enough runs on the board has become a major worry for the side.         
	Well I think whatever games are remaining we have to win them all. We have been pushed to the corner and we will have to start to put up some descent totals, Tendulkar said.         
	I think we didnt scored many runs on the board but the bowling department was very good. So the basic problem is not having enough runs on the board, he added.         
	He, however, lauded his bowlers for their gutsy display against the DareDevils and making a match out of the paltry total.         
	I dont think if you score 117 runs and still make a good match out of it and I think we were pretty much there in the match. Our bowling and fielding were disciplined. Sometimes things just dont click for you, he said.         
	It is always good to have big totals on the board but I think the positive of the game for us was that we were able to push the game to the 19th over.         
	The spinners did a fantastic job. And they brought us back into the game, he said.         
	Tendulkar also said that it was a tough call to leave out Sanath Jayasuriya from the playing eleven.         
	The Mumbai Indians Friday dropped Jayasuriya and in his place roped in Luke Ronchi who was run out without opening his account.         
	Well I know it is tough. But sometimes you have to take certain calls., the Mum said.

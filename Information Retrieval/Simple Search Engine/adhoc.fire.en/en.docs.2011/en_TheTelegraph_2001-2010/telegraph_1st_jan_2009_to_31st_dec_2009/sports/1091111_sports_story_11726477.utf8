            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Rohit Sharma during nets in Mumbai on Tuesday. (PTI)                           
	Mumbai: The India hopefuls like Rohit Sharma and Manoj Tiwary would like to make their performance count when they represent the Board Presidents XI in the three-day match against Sri Lanka starting here on Wednesday.         
	While the Indian squad for the first two Tests against the Lankans has already been selected, the names for the five-match one-day International series are still to be decided.         
	Bengal batsman Tiwary, who has been in good touch this season, said: My performance is in my hands and I want to make it count.         
	Pragyan Ojha would look to add to his impressive five for 52 for Hyderabad in Himachal Pradeshs second innings while Dhawal Kulkarni and Tiwarys state teammates Wriddhiman Saha and Ashok Dinda would be eager to boost their chances of getting a national call up.         
	The visitors, on the other hand, would obviously look to put the lone practice game ahead of the first Test, starting in Ahmedabad from November 16, to best use.         
	Unfortunately, unexpected showers affected the teams training on the eve of the match and could severely curtail the first days play.         
	Teams         
	Board Presidents XI (from): Rohit Sharma, Robin Uthappa, Abhinav Mukund, Ajinkya Rahane, Manoj Tiwary, Wriddhiman Saha, Piyush Chawla, Pragyan Ojha, Pradeep Sangwan, Dhawal Kulkarni, Ashok Dinda, Pankaj Singh, Abhishek Nayar, Ishank Jaggi.         
	Sri Lanka (from): Kumar Sangakkara, Tillekaratne Dilshan, Rangana Herath, Mahela Jayawardene, Prasanna Jayawardene, Thilina Kandamby, Thilan Samaraweera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Angelo Mathews, Ajantha Mendis, Muttiah Muralidharan, Tharanga Paranavitana, Dammika Prasad, Kaushal Silva, Thilan Thushara, Chanaka Welegedara.

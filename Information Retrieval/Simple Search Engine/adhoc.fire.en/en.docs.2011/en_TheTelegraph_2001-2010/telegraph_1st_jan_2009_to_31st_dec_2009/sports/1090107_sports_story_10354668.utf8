The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Daniel Vettori pitches for extra Test
                                                   Daniel Vettori pitches for extra Test
                      
	Wellington: New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori has supported Indias call for an extra Test when the team comes here in March this year.         
	India are scheduled to reach New Zealand on March 1 and play their first match, a Twenty20 clash here, on March 6.         
	Five one-dayers follow before the first of the originally-planned two-Test series starts in Hamilton from March 26. The second Test will be held in Wellington from April 3.         
	But the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has asked its New Zealand counterpart to arrange for an extra Test after the Indian government refused to clear the teams tour of Pakistan for a scheduled series.         
	Im pretty excited. I think most players have been crying out for that third Test match style series, Vettori said on Wednesday. (PTI)

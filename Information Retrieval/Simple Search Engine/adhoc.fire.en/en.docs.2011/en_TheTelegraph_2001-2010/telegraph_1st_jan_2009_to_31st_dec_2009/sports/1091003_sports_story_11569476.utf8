                                                   Chirag bank on Edmilson 
            A STAFF REPORTER                                Edmilson       
	Calcutta: Chirag United coach Subrata Bhattacharya believes that Edmilson Marquess inclusion in the team will solve his problems in the forward line.         
	After Edmilsons brace in a practice match against Customs, played at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday, Bhattacharya appeared to be a contented man.         
	I was facing some problems in the striking zone Now, with Edmilson coming in I hope the problems will be solved, Bhattacharya said after Friday.         
	Besides Edmilson, Joshimar, Bijen Singh and PC Lalawmpuiya each scored apiece, as Chirag beat Customs 5-2. But the club management is still in search of a sniper. An Ivory Coast striker as a possible replacement for the unimpressive Joshimar, would be soon coming for trials, it was learnt.         
	Speaking about Edmilsons inclusion in their I-League opener against Mohun Bagan, Bhattacharya said: Look its a marathon league. A lot depends on the performance of the foreigners. The first two three matches hardly matters. We have to play 26 matches and my aim is to finish among the top four.         
	And for Edmilson, its a known place. I am confident that he will do well I have not decided but he may play on Monday, he added. For the season, Brazilian Eduardo along with Asian quota player Australian Keegan Nash will be Bhattacharyas mainstay in the defence. Keegan, who is yet to receive his international release, will have to sit out in Mondays match.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Crowd support helped: Chetan
                                                   Crowd support helped: Chetan
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Hyderabad: Local favourite Chetan Anand did not let the motley crowd down at the Gachibowli Stadium on Monday. The world No. 15 got past Korean Ji Hoon Hong 21-6, 21-16 in the first round of the World Badminton Championships and the crowd loved every bit of it.         
	They swayed to his smashes, egged him on when the chips were down. And when the match was over, they chanted his name.         
	So, it was not surprising when Chetan said in the post-match press conference: The crowd support helped me. I would like to see more supporters in my next match.         
	Chetan said that initially he was finding it difficult to get into the groove. I was very stiff and a bit nervous. But as the match progressed I got my confidence. My opponent also was under pressure, thanks to the crowd. And that really helped my cause.         
	Chetan attributed his slump in the second game to a sudden loss of concentration. At 12-12 he won a close point. And suddenly I was a bit nervous. Thankfully I recovered in time, he said.         
	Chetan, however, promised that his fans would see an improved performance from him in the next rounds. These are early days. I am confident of improving in the next round.         
	Chetan said Pullela Gopichands word of advice on Monday morning also came handy. He told me to play my natural game and not to think too much about Hong. And the stint at the Prakash Padukone Academy in Bangalore also helped me. I was there for the last few weeks and learnt a lot from Prakash sir.         
	The national champion conceded that 2009 till now has not been that great for him. In most of the tournaments I played there were some problems. But thats not an excuse for being not upto the mark, he signed off.

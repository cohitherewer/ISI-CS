                                                                                                                       7                                        Confusion over Yuvi
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Yuvraj Singh                           
	Calcutta/Rajkot: Conflicting signals regarding the injury to Yuvraj Singhs finger on the left hand emerged Sunday. All this largely due a total lack of communication from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).         
	It couldnt be confirmed, but there were reports that Yuvraj has a fractured finger. A well-placed source, however, gave a different version.         
	While around 8 pm it was learnt that Yuvraj would be out of the first two ODIs against Sri Lanka, it later emerged that the team management expects him to be fit and a call would be taken after practice on Monday morning.         
	Yuvraj injured his finger while fielding during the second Twenty20 in Mohali on Saturday.         
	Yuvraj, who took three for 23 in Mohali, bowled only three overs before he was taken off after the 17th. However, the injury didnt affect his batting as he slammed an unbeaten 60 off 25 balls, hitting three boundaries and five sixes, to help India comfortably chase down 207 with five balls to spare.         
	He was taken to Dr Dinkar Virparias clinic in Rajkot for a check-up after he complained of pain on arrival, sources in the Saurashtra Cricket Association said. An X-ray was also done.         
	Virat Kohli, who was called up as cover for Gautam Gambhir after the opener was suspected to have been struck with swine flu on the eve of the Mohali game, is with the side. Gambhirs tests later turned out to be negative and he played the Mohali match.         
	It may be recalled that Yuvraj fractured the little finger on his right hand in the midst of a conventional training session in Johannesburg on the eve of the Champions Trophy. That injury kept him out for six weeks.         
	Team India are already without pacer Sreesanth, who is recuperating from swine flu in a Mohali hospital.

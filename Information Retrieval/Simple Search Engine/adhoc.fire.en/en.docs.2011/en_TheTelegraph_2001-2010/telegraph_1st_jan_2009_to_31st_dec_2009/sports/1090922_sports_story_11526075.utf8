The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Roger Millas message for the Bhutias
                                                   Roger Millas message for the Bhutias
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Zurich: Work harder, is the talismanic Roger Millas advice to Indian footballers.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph on the sidelines of a Fifa (and Coca-Cola) function here on Monday, Milla said: Indias population exceeds one billion and, if it can have such a good cricket team, I dont see why it cant also have a good football side...         
	So, did he have a message for the Bhaichung Bhutias? Milla grinned and replied: Of course, work harder...         
	As Milla isnt fluent in English, he spoke in French and a lady interpreter did the translations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 4 Indians advance
                                                   4 Indians advance
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Atanu Das and Pawan Xalxo in the junior mens recurve, Sanjay Boro in the cadet recurve men and Deepika Kumari in the cadet recurve women, moved into the quarter finals of the 11th Youth World archery championship at Ogden in Utah Wednesday.         
	These four are the only Indians who survived to fight another day in the individual elimination round as it was the end of the road for those in the compound bow group.         
	None of the eight compound archers was a match for the world class opponents. Only Sudhakar Kumar Paswan made it to the pre-quarter finals in the cadet mens section after the rest were shown the door either in the first or second round.

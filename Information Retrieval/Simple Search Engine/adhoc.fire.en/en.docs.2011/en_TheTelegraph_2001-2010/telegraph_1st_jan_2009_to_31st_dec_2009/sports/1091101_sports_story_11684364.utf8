                                                     Barreto: Its sad to see history from sidelines
            A STAFF REPORTER            Barreto at the Bagan ground on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Jose Ramirez Barreto still cant forget that he was not on the ground when Mohun Bagan scored the fifth goal against East Bengal last Sunday. I am sad. I waited for this moment ever since I came to Mohun Bagan some 10 years back, and when it came I was sitting on the bench. Just think Barreto said on Saturday.         
	Barreto, in fact, broke down while being substituted in the 57th minute and Edeh Chidi scored the fifth goal (and his fourth) in the 66th. It was more of spontaneous reaction to his injury than the realisation that he was missing a bit of history.         
	Barreto, however, was happy that Chidi was taking the burden of scoring in his absence. It is a good sign. Chidi is getting the goals. I am hopeful that he will score more. And once I come back we can pose quite a few problems for the rivals, the affable Brazilian said.         
	Barreto said Bagan were very impressive against Lajong FC and the win should give the team confidence. Winning at Lajong was a big thing. We played really well on Thursday. It will never be easy for anyone to win there, Barreto said.         
	Barreto said he is recovering well from the hamstring injury and is confident of a comeback. As of now I am doing well. Lets see how it goes, he said.         
	On the artificial turf Barreto however was diplomatic. Look for the last few years the ground was not maintained. But with the artificial turf at least that problem has been solved. Yeah its a bit hard and you can injure your knee or ankle while turning. There are good points as well bad points with the artificial turf, he said.         
	Meanwhile, in a fine gesture, coach Karim Bencharifa paid a visit to the East Bengal fan Sambhu Nath Hazra, who suffered a heart attack during last Sundays match, at a nursing home in central Calcutta. The Moroccan also gave the family financial help.

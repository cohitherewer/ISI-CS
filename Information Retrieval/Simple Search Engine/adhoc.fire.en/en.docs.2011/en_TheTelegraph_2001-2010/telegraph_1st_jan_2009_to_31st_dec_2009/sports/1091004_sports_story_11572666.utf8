The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pakistan tighten noose
                                                   Pakistan tighten noose
                      
	Johannesburg: Umar Akmal and Mohammed Yousuf starred in a brief bail-out act and Mohammed Aamer played a crucial cameo down the order as Pakistan managed a modest 233 for nine against New Zealand in the second semi-final of the ICC Champions Trophy here Saturday.         
	The New Zealand bowlers kept a tight line interspersed with the odd short ball and their fielders ensured that the opponents had to work hard for every run. This, in a way, frustrated Pakistan into giving their wickets away at important junctures.         
	Pakistan top order had left them precariously poised at 86 for four inside 21 overs before Yousufs (45) experience and Umars (55) aggression put them back on track with an 80-run stand for the fifth wicket.         
	But once the duo departed, Pakistan middle order crumbled and it was Aamers (19 off 20 balls) unbeaten 35-run stand off 34 balls with Saed Ajmal (14) for the last wicket that lent some respectability to Pakistans score.         
	Ian Butler (4/44) was the most successful New Zealand bowler, while Daniel Vettori claimed three for 43.         
	It did not exactly rain fours and sixes right from the word go but the 46 runs put together by Imran Nazir (28) and Kamran Akmal (24) in nine-odd overs meant Pakistan were off to sedate, if not spectacular, start without early setbacks.         
	Pakistan captain Younis Khan, however, was soon left to reflect on his decision of batting first as the next 40 runs cost the side their top four batsmen, including the skipper himself.         
	Nazir had warmed up with three fours off an Ian Butler over before a Shane Bond snorter did him in.         
	Bond was accurate on Saturday, consistently bowling in-swingers on the off stump. The first such delivery to Nazir showed him a slight bat-pad gap. Bond kept consistently working on that area.         
	Butler then dealt two quick blows that had the Pakistan top order reeling.         
	The lanky Black Caps pacer had Shoaib Malik caught in the slips in his third over and then returned to dismiss Kamran just when the batsman was looking dangerous.         
	At 69 for three, things were not looking rosy and Pakistan needed a captains knock from Younis but Saturday was not his day.         
	His opposite number Vettori had flighted it on the off-stump and Younis wanted to work it to the onside. But all he managed was a leading edge and Ross Taylor pouched the dolly at short cover.         
	Yousuf is not new to such crisis and he decided to haul Pakistan out of the hole in company of Umar. The caution, however, meant that boundaries were not easy to come by.         
	It was at this stage that Umar decided to play the aggressors role, leaving grafting to his senior partner Yousuf.         
	The right-hander went after Vettori, hitting the Black Caps skipper for successive boundaries on two occasions to keep the scoreboard ticking.         
	Yousuf fell five-run shy of his half-century when Kyle Mills castled him and while Umar did notch up his second fifty the youngster fell to Vettori two overs later, triggering another batting collapse.         
	Following Umar was Shahid Afridi. But if the Younis Khans were hoping that runs would flow from the Pakistan Twenty20 captains bat then they were in for further disappointment.         
	The man with the record for the fastest one-day century enjoyed the briefest of stints at the crease, scoring a measly four off an identical number of balls. The feisty Pathan became Butlers third victim when, trying to direct the ball to third man, he gave an edge to McCullum behind the stumps.         
	Afridis sudden departure would have set the Pakisatn think tank thinking. Ideally, Younis Khan should have taken the batting Powerplay when the pair of Yousuf and Umar were set.

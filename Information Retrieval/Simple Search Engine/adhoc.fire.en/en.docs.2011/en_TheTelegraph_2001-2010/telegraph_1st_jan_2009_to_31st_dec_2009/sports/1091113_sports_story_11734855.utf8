The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I still feel nervous: Sachin
                                                                                                                                   I still feel nervous: Sachin
                      
	Mumbai: Even after grabbing virtually every batting record in his illustrious career, Indian batting icon Sachin Tendulkar says he still feels nervous when he walks out to bat.         
	I believe feeling nervous enables one to give his best. You can get nervous only when you care about something and I care about cricket, Tendulkar said while speaking at a felicitation function for batting legends Sunil Gavaskar and Gundappa Viswanath here Thursday.         
	Tendulkar spoke about how his idol Gavaskar personally came to greet him after he broke his record of 34 centuries.         
	There is not a bigger thing than getting recognised from the person you adore. He advised me not to stop and carry on. I am trying to follow his advise, Tendulkar, the highest run-getter in both Test and one-day formats, said.         
	Tendulkar also spoke about how Gavaskar wrote a letter to him in his school days in 1987 after he had failed to win the best junior cricketer of the year award.         
	I was very disappointed not to win the award. Thats when I got a letter from him. That letter was more valuable to me than the award itself.         
	During the 1987 World Cup, when I was a ball boy at the Wankhede, I remember him (Gavaskar) calling me to the dressing room and introducing me to the entire team. I was too stunned and hardly spoke during the entire day, he added.         
	Gavaskar said that if he was reborn, he would like to be a fast bowler and give it back to all those who had hurled bouncers at him.           (PTI)

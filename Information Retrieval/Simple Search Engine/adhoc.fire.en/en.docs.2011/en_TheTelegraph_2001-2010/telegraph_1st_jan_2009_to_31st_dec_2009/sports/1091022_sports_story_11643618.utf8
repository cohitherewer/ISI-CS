The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sunday not on mind: Bhowmick
                                                   Sunday not on mind: Bhowmick
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: For East Bengal, Wednesdays 4-0 victory against Eastern Railway in their Calcutta Football League opener should be an ideal scoreline before their Sunday I-League derby against arch-rivals Mohun Bagan. Its also a stress buster for coach Subhas Bhowmick, who has been at the receiving end for the poor show by the club this season.         
	But Bhowmick was not in the best of moods at the post-match interaction with the media, deciding to bypass or refuse most of the questions thrown at him.         
	Reacting to the obvious question whether this victory will serve as a morale booster ahead of the derby, Bhowmick said: Dont ask me about Sunday. Im not thinking about that match. That will be a different affair altogether.         
	He also refused to name any probable inclusions from Wednesdays line-up in the derby as he said: I wouldnt like to divulge anything about the probable team.         
	And most of the players who took field today (Wednesday) wont be present in the big match either.         
	His reserve bench performed quite well on the day but all efforts to get his reactions on that fell flat on its face as he said: Why should I say how my boys played?         
	It was for everyone to see how they performed on the field.         
	Among the four goals scored by the red and gold brigade, none came from their strikers Abel Hammond and Subhas Singh.         
	Subhas was the culprit on more than one occasion of letting down his team.         
	When asked if that was a problem, Bhowmick said: Yeah thats true. But the fact that my strikers were moving well, co-ordinating between themselves and constructing good moves augurs well for the team.

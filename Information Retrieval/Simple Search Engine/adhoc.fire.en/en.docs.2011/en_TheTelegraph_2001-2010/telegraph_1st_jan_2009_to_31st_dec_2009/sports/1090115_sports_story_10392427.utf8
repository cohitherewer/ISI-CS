    - One-day Rankings
  -   Chris Gayle emerges as the new number one       A STAFF REPORTER            Chris Gayle                                 
	Calcutta: The West Indies captain Chris Gayle toppled his Indian counterpart Mahendra Singh Dhoni to reach the top of the batsmens list in Reliance Mobile ICC ODI rankings.         
	Dhoni slipped down one spot to be placed second with 779 points. A series of fine performances against New Zealand catapulted Gayle to the top of the table and he is ahead of Dhoni by four points.         
	However, Dhoni will have a chance to reclaim the top spot when India take on Sri Lanka in a five-match ODI series later this month.         
	The 29-year-old Jamaican managed an impressive 135 off 129 balls  including nine fours and five sixes  in the final ODI against New Zealand in Napier, although his side eventually lost the match.         
	Gayle was also ranked fourth in the list of allrounders with 336 points.         
	The left-hand batsman was last ranked number one nearly five years ago (in April 2004) but he has not been out of the top 20 since the middle of 2002, according to an ICC release.         
	Australias Michael Hussey was pushed to the third spot from second.         
	Indias left-hand batsman Yuvraj Singh slipped one rung to the sixth place while South Africa captain Graeme Smith lost two spots to be placed fifth.         
	Smith is likely to fall even further with injury forcing him out of the upcoming five-match ODI series against Australia starting on Friday.         
	Indias master batsman Sachin Tendulkar retained his 12th spot with 708 points, while Australia skipper Ricky Ponting (740) remained on the seventh position.         
	However, Hussey has the opportunity to push back up the rankings from third with the upcoming series against South Africa.         
	Also aiming to clamber back up the rankings will be Husseys captain, Ricky Ponting, currently occupying seventh position in the table. A return to the top five is not out of the question for the Tasmanian.         
	South Africas AB de Villiers will also be looking to improve his current ranking of 14.         
	De Villierss in-form teammate Jean-Paul Duminy will also be eyeing a higher spot in the rankings. Duminy, currently ranked 43rd, has had an extremely good run with the bat in Australia and has the potential to climb the rankings in the coming weeks.         
	In the bowlers list, New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori slipped from the number one spot to second. Australias Nathan Bracken heads the bowlers list.         
	Zaheer Khan, placed at tied 10th with 660 points, was the only Indian in the list of top-20 bowlers.         
	Australias Mitchell Johnson gained climbed one place to fourth.         
	None of the Indian cricketers figure in the list of allrounders, headed by New Zealands Jacob Oram.

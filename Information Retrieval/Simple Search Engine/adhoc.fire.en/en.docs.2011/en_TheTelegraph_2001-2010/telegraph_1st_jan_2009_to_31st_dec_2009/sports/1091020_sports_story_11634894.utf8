	 The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) are miffed with the Indian Football Association (IFA) who has announced dates for the Super Division League matches without their prior consent.      
	The CAB is in possession of the Maidan grounds from October 1 and the preparation of pitches and grounds starts from October 15.       
	With IFA scheduling league matches, there might be a chance that pitches adjacent to Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting grounds maybe affected.       
	We are still not sure what kind of solution can be worked out when IFA didnt even discuss the fixture with us before announcing the dates of their league, CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey stated on Monday.                
	 Mohammedan Sporting defender Peter Odafe may join East Bengal on lien.       
	The former Mohun Bagan defender has offers from Mumbai FC and Salgaocar but East Bengal may snap him up to bolster their defence.       
	Meanwhile, Ashim Biswas joined Chirag Uniteds practice session after being out of action for almost two years.

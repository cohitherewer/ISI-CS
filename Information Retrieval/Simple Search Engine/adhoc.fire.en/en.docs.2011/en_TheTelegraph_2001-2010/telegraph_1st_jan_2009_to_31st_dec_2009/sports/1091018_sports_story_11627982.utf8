                                                   Indians seal series
                      
	Surrey: Continuing their stupendous run, India scored a comfortable 2-0 win against Canada in the fourth Test and secured an unassailable 3-0 lead in the seven-match series at Tamanawis Par here Saturday.         
	Vikram Pillay scored from a penalty stroke in the 22nd minute while Rajpal Singh shot home in the 38th minute to script Indias victory.         
	India had won the first two matches and played a 4-4 draw in the third Test match. Canada began aggressively winning a penalty corner in the third minute after goalkeeper Sreejesh made a dangerous save from Ranjeev Deols shot at goal.         
	The Indian defence stood out as they blocked the indirect attempt from Scott Tupper. The Canadians won their second of six penalty corners after Philip Wright was stopped by Bharat Chhikara but Sreejesh brought off a splendid save.         
	India could have broken the ice midway in the first half after Gurwinder Chandi powered his way into the striking circle but Vikram Pillay was a trifle late at the second post.         
	However, India got a penalty stroke when Chandi was tripped by Canada goalkeeper Matt Peck in the 22nd minute. Pillay shot in to the custodians left to give India the lead.         
	The visitors had two more opportunities to increase the lead before half time, but on the first, a penalty corner pull in was not stopped, while Tushar Khandker missed on a goalmouth scramble later.         
	The second half saw India in total domination of the proceedings with quality midfield and backup play highlighted by captain Dhahanjay Mahadik, Gurbaj Singh and Sardar Singh.         
	Prabhjot Singh grabbed the ball from close to the centre line, body feinting and dribbling past a host of Canadian players before setting up Rajpal Singh three minutes into the second half.         
	The wily Chandigarh winger smashed the ball past Peck from the edge of the circle to make it 2-0 for the Indians.         
	Rajpal had another opportunity to score when he combined with Bharat cutting into the circle from the left flank but his shot was well taken by Peck.         
	India were awarded their second penalty corner when Prabhjot was obstructed by Wayne Fernandes but Sandeep Singh flicked wide.         
	The fifth Test will be played here Sunday. (PTI)

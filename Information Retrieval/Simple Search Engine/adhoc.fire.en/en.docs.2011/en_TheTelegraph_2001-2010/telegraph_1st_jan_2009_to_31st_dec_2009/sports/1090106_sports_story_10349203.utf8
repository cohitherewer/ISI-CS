The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvraj role in Sania   recovery
                                                   Yuvraj role in Sania   recovery
                            
	Hong Kong: Sania Mirza on Monday said she had recovered from a career-threatening injury with help from cricketer Yuvraj Singh.         
	A beaming Mirza was delighted to be back on court after the painful wrist problem that forced her out of the Beijing Olympics in tears and left her unable to perform even such simple functions as lifting a fork for eating.         
	Australian physiotherapist Amir Takla and many others suggested a surgery for healing the injured wrist and then on the recommendation of Yuvraj, Sania consulted Jatin Choudhry, who by applying spiral therapy healed her injury in a very short period.         
	It is great blessing. I am lucky to find somebody like Jatin. It was almost a desperate time. Then he came and did a miracle, Sania said.         
	A lot of people thought that I needed another surgery to heal and that it was the only option. There were countless MRIs and I was running around hospitals. So, it is really miraculous for it to have healed like this.         
	He (Yuvraj) said why dont you try and give it a shot. I did not have a choice. He really played a big part (in healing the wrist). Its a Korean Therapy and it worked on me. she said.         
	Mirza is taking part in the World Team Challenge exhibition event here. The 22-year-old, who reached a career-high ranking of 27 in August 2007, plummeted down the rankings last year as injury blighted her season and is now ranked 100.         
	The World Team Challenge, from January 7-10, features four teams representing Europe, Russia, the Americas and Asia-Pacific. Players includeJelena Jankovic, Venus Williams, and Vera Zvonareva           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cricket is fighting for survival
                                                   Cricket is fighting for survival

	I never thought I would see the day when cricketers would return to their families as soldiers often do after a protracted battle at the front. But, sadly, this is what I saw when the Sri Lankan team returned home from Lahore.         
	It was around half past nine on Tuesday morning when I received a call from the Prime Minister about the terrible incident unfolding in Lahore. Over the next four hours, we were in constant touch with the Pakistan authorities and our embassy in Islamabad. We feared the worst which, thankfully, was not the case. It has now been replaced by the gnawing feeling that its cricket which is now fighting for survival.         
	I, as a former cricketer and Sri Lanka board official, have often been confronted by the security issue in Pakistan. Last year, as president of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), I took the call for the Asia Cup to be held in Pakistan. It wasnt an easy decision but assurances from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), in consultation with the government, were comforting.         
	I personally went over and was delighted to see top-class security arrangements. The Asia Cup passed off without a hiccup. The players were happy too. I am not sure how the security issue between the Sri Lanka board and its Pakistan counterpart was handled this time around. A lot of uncomfortable questions would now be asked.         
	The next big issue confronting cricket in the subcontinent is now at hand. The Indian Premier League (IPL) is just a few weeks away. Auctions, transfers and security issues were being put in place. Now they would be up for review.         
	Foreign cricketers, in particular, would be questioning if the enormous sum of money on offer could make up for the anxiety their families would suffer and the genuine advice of their managers. Such issues invite a herd-like reactions from human beings. Cricketers are no different.         
	A few walkouts, I fear, could open floodgates. And before you realise, the wheels of cricket would come to a stop. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Indian government must present a unified and determined stance to the world. Any dithering on their part would only add to the insecurity of the visiting players.         
	The issue is still hot. I hope it cools down over the next few days. Cricketers and administrators can then think and decide on the future course of action. Cricket, especially on the subcontinent, cant afford to take another hit.         
	But then, is this only the responsibility of the subcontinents cricket boards and the governments? The issue might be at our doorstep but the danger is no less alive in the rest of the world. Everyone needs to join hands to tackle terrorism. A helicopter on a cricket pitch is symbolic of the gravest threat to the game we love.         
	Cricket and war is now being talked about in the same breath. Its a sinking feeling, but we must rise together and take on this menace which confronts our game. (PTI)

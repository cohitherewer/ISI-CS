The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Real not a one-man team, insists Cristiano Ronaldo
                                                     Real not a one-man team, insists Cristiano Ronaldo
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Cristiano Ronaldo during his presentation at the Bernabeu on Monday. (AFP)                           
	Madrid: Cristiano Ronaldo has talked down suggestions that he will single-handedly lead Real Madrid to European glory next season.         
	However, the worlds most expensive player at 80 million did admit his ambition is to once again win the Champions League trophy he claimed with Manchester United and will be doing everything he can to achieve it.         
	Madrid have been crowned champions of Europe nine times during their illustrious history, but have been underachieving of late  falling at the last-16 stage five consecutive seasons.         
	Those failures have wounded Madrid and claiming that elusive 10th European crown has turned into something of a Holy Grail for the Spanish giants now, particularly with next summers final being held at their Bernabeu home.         
	But Ronaldo does not see himself as the only one capable of turning the clubs fate around insisting he is not the only one that plays.         
	He said: In the games there are many players. I will be part of the team and I will give my best to win the Champions League. We have a great team and a great coach [Manuel Pellegrini]. We are going to take it step by step, taking it calmly, and then we can think about winning the Champions League. We have a decent chance, but we need to take it slow and work hard.         
	Ronaldo played a key role in helping United reach two consecutive Champions league finals and has confidence in his ability to adapt in order to help Real achieve more European success.         
	I know Ill feel more pressure here than at Manchester United, but I have faith in myself and Im ambitious. I want the league to begin so I can do my absolute best, he added.         
	I expect a different league of course. I played six years in the Premier League and its very difficult. Its faster and players are stronger. Its very competitive here as well. I think Im ready for the challenge. I eat well, sleep well, drink well. Its not a problem, Im ready for La Liga.         
	I hope I can give some problems to defenders, and I think it will be interesting.         
	The 24-year-old has repeatedly talked of how his move to the Bernabeu has fulfilled a childhood dream; but now he said it is time to focus on the job at hand and prove to Real they made the right decision when they made him the worlds most expensive transfer.         
	Ive always said a club must pay a lot of money to get the best players, he said. I want to prove that they made the right decision. It makes me feel proud.         
	Ronaldo conceded that one aspect of the game will certainly benefit him: Spanish referees. He often complained about receiving scant protection in the Premier League and his ex-manager Alex Ferguson also suggested that players often got away with kicking him.         
	In England, there are very nice referees, but in La Liga you have unbelievable referees, Ronaldo said with a smile.         
	Ronaldo said one of the last things Ferguson said to him before he left Manchester was that he hopes Man United and Real Madrid meet in the Champions League final. That would be fantastic. (Ferguson) joked about it with me before I left, about seeing me here in May, Ronaldo said. I hope.         
	Although he preferred not to say it, Ronaldo did mention Barcelona when it came to the one match he was most looking forward to.         
	A Spanish girlfriend was not a priority after media reports suggested Ronaldo had spent part of his vacation in the company of Paris Hilton.         
	Its not one of the clubs objectives that Cristiano gets a girlfriend, the clubs director general Jorge Valdano answered while trying to keep the focus on football. The objective is that he plays the way he knows how.

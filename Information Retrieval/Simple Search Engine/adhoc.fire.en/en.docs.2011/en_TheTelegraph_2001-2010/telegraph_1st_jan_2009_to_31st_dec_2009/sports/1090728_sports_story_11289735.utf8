                                                     T20 not a threat to Tests: Akram
  - Former captain sees no future for Shoaib       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT    
	New Delhi: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram believes Twenty20 cricket can never be a threat to Test cricket.         
	Test cricket will always remain the pinnacle of the game, Akram said here Monday. The entertainment value of T20 is only a passing phase. Every cricketer in the world wants to be known for his exploits in Test cricket. Sachin Tendulkar is famous for his contribution to Test cricket.         
	I simply dont agree with the comments of Chris Gayle and Kevin Pietersen that Test cricket has no future, Akram said.         
	Twenty20 or ODI is good fun but Test cricket is the only measure of the quality of a cricketer. I have told the kids (in the Gatorade academy) that they should consider Test cricket as their ultimate goal and everything else would follow, but it does not happen the other way round, he added.         
	Akram, who was speaking at the launch of the Gatorade Centre for Pace Excellence here, felt the International Cricket Council (ICC) should do something to increase the popularity of Test cricket.         
	It wont be a bad idea if the concept of day-night Test cricket is introduced, Akram said. The four-day format is not going to work. Rather, the ICC should use pitch inspectors to make sure wickets around the world produce results.         
	Asked to comment on Shoaib Akhtars omission from the list of probables for the Champions Trophy, Akram said Pakistan needed to look ahead.         
	I am not too sure whether the Rawalpindi Express would again be picked for the national side, he wondered. Nobody can say that Akhtar was not backed by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). He even played in the series against Australia in Abu Dhabi. Now that he has fallen out with the PCB, I dont see him returning to the side anymore. He has no place in the current team. The present set of youngsters are doing very well.         
	They have to look ahead and think about the future. They have to back the youngsters who will do the job for them, even if you look at the 2011 World Cup.         
	The left-arm pacer with 900-plus international wickets also predicted a difficult future for Mohammed Asif, who put his doping and drug episodes behind to return to Pakistans list of probables for the Champions Trophy.         
	My advice to Asif would be to learn from your mistakes. I sincerely hope he learns from the 300 mistakes that he has made in the last two years.         
	Hes young, talented and one of the best Pakistani bowlers but it will take him some time to return because Aamer is now bowling really well, Akram said.         
	He warned international comebacks was not easy and cited the case of Umar Gul and Sohail Tanvir to prove his point.         
	Even Tanvir was struggling in Twenty20. Gul is phenomenal but I dont think he bowled well enough in the Test matches.         
	My advice to Gul is Twenty20 and ODI are fine but if you are to be recognised as a good bowler you have to do well in Test cricket, Akram said.The former great sounded upset when he said that the PCB was not utilising his services to nurture fast bowlers in Pakistan.         
	I have helped players like (Mitchell) Johnson, Irfan Pathan and even Umar Gul recently. I also helped pick Mohammed Amir and Tanvir from camps organised in Pakistan, and now they are playing for the national team. But I can only offer further help if they (PCB) call me, said Akram.         
	The former Pakistan captain did not like Allan Donalds suggestion that ball tampering should be made legal by the ICC.         
	I dont know why Donald said so. ICC should not legalise ball tampering. Reverse swing comes naturally to some bowlers. It is a skill that a bowler has to develop, he said.

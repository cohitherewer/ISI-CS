The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vettori: Weve got   the momentum
                                                     Vettori: Weve got   the momentum
                    Daniel Vettori                      
	The following are excerpts from New Zealand captain Daniel Vettoris media conference, at the Wanderers, on Friday afternoon:         
	Weve got the momentum... Its nice to enter a semi-final knowing that weve won two big games (Sri Lanka, England)... Well be starting with a lot of confidence... Were expected to make the semi-final and also expected to lose in the semi-final...         
	So, we want to change the script a little bit and it will be satisfying for me to take New Zealand to the final... Id always been confident of making the semi-final...         
	Actually, after collecting the Spirit of Cricket award, it would be the ultimate to win a major tournament...         
	Where pressure is concerned, I think theres plenty on us to get past the semi-final and were up against a higher-ranked team... Any team going into a semi-final would feel the pressure...         
	I think well be playing on the wicket where we played against Sri Lanka and that had a lot of runs... I dont think the toss will make a big difference...         
	Pakistans spin bowling has been impressive over the past year or so, with Shahid Afridi and Saeed Ajmal combining exceptionally well... Thats coupled with a very good seam bowling attack and there are no obvious weaknesses in their batting... Its a very good side, but were hoping to catch them on what could be their off day...         
	The update on (all-rounder) Grant Elliotts injury is that the pain-killing injections work when hes batting, but dont when hes bowling... Well probably leave the decision till the last possible moment...         
	Injuries are frustrating and, the other day, Id said we were down to the bare bones... We had injuries in the World T20, too... Ive gone through this before... We do have a bad reputation of players becoming unavailable at the last minute...         
	The only thing that I can do, individually, is to control my performances and Ive been doing that...           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT IN JOHANNESBURG

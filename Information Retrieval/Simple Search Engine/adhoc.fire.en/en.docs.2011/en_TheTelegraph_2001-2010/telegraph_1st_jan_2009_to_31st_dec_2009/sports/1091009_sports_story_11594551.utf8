The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | JP Duminy shines as Cobras win
                                                   JP Duminy shines as Cobras win
                            
	Bangalore: JP Duminy dazzled with an unbeaten 99 to guide Cape Cobras to a five-wicket victory over the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the opening Group C match of the inaugural Champions League T20 Thursday.         
	Not a single Bangalore bowler was spared as the left-hander struck eight fours and five sixes in his scintillating 52-ball knock to power the South African side home with two balls to spare. For the Royal Challengers, Praveen Kumar picked up three wickets for 32 runs.         
	Earlier, Robin Uthappa made a brisk 51 off 39 balls while Ross Taylor scored an unbeaten 53 to help the Royal Challengers post a formidable 180 for four from their 20 overs.         
	The Cobras run chase got off to horrendous start as Praveen Kumar took Herschelle Gibbs outside edge with the last ball of the opening over to see the opener depart for a duck.         
	Cobras captain Andrew Puttick became Praveens next victim when Virat Kohli picked up his catch.         
	It was then that Henry Davids (27 off 21) and JP Duminy stabilised the innings with a 48-run third wicket stand before the former fell prey to first change R. Vinay Kumar.         
	But Duminy used his experience to great effect and played sensibly to keep the Cobras in the game.         
	Needing 53 off the last five, Ryan Canning stepped on the gas, cutting Kohli for four. Duminy finished off the over with another boundary off the last ball.         
	To the disappointment of the Bangalore fans, skipper Anil Kumble dropped Duminy on 74 off his own bowling and the left-hander then rubbed salt into the former India captains wound by hitting his next ball over the mid-wicket boundary.         
	The 25-year-old middle-order batsman, who plays for Mumbai Indians in the IPL, finished off the proceedings, slamming Vinay Kumar over wide long-on.         
	Earlier, electing to bat first the Royal Challengers had a cautious start to their innings and it took a smart shot from Jacques Kallis to bring the first boundary in the second over.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Bayliss happy with batting
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Rajkot: Sri Lanka coach Trevor Bayliss on Tuesday said at a press conference that he was happy with their batsmens form ahead of the opening ODI.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Thoughts at the start of the one-dayers         
	We are looking forward to the one-dayers. Both the sides played some very competitive cricket in T20. The best thing to come out of the T20 was our batting. I am happy with the form the batsmen displayed.         
	Sanath Jayasuriyas batting position         
	Sanath can bat anywhere in the line-up That adds a bit of flexibility to us. The form of (Upul) Tharanga on top of the order has been quite good for us. Tharanga had scored some 70s and 80s in the home series against Pakistan a few months ago. We cant overlook him on current form.         
	On the new players joining the side         
	Some new guys have also come into the Sri Lanka team for the one-dayers. The new guys lift the morale of the others. Thats what happened to us in the T20s, and some more new guys have joined us for the ODIs.         
	If he was worried about the fielding in the second T20         
	Our fielding was bit of a disappointment in the second T20, but we did well in the first match. That happens in cricket. Im not unduly worried.         
	If there were any injury concerns         
	No. Only (Lasith) Malinga is not feeling at his best, bit of a fever. We will wait and watch till tomorrow (Tuesday).

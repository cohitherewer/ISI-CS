	The Indian Premier League had threatened to loom large over Andrew Strausss first tour as England captain but as the team prepared to fly to the West Indies on Wednesday morning he proffered a solution that was almost as cunning as it was sensible.         
	Give players more responsibility for their own preparation was the strength of it, though when that includes not playing in the round of Championship matches prior to the first Test of the summer, the sticking point that was limiting Englands Test players to just two weeks in the IPL, there was some bargaining going on as well.         
	I want to see players who are able to think on their feet out in the middle, take responsibility for the situation, and dont leave it for someone else, Strauss said on Tuesday.         
	The only way we can do that is by giving them responsibility off the pitch as well. I am looking for my players to start thinking about what they need to do in terms of preparation.         
	As early manifestos go it was a shrewd start by Englands captain, handing as it did a degree of self-determination to his players while simultaneously nudging the England and Wales Cricket Board in a conciliatory direction. Strauss almost certainly has nothing to gain himself from IPL but he will have much to lose on this tour  the West Indies will not be the pushovers most seem to think  and in its Ashes aftermath, if his two top players, Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen, begin to feel aggrieved due to limited opportunities in the IPL.         
	Players have to be fully prepared for a Test match but what that preparation is depends on the player to a certain extent. In keeping with my philosophy, Im quite happy to say to my players, This is what I need preparation-wise. I believe the players who will be involved in the IPL are experienced campaigners. They didnt just turn up yesterday. They know what Test cricket is about and know what preparation they need. Whatever time they have before the Test match Im sure theyll use it wisely.         
	It will still require some back-tracking from Lalit Modi, the chief commissioner of the IPL, who needs to relax his stipulation of four weeks participation, but at least Strauss has paved the way for Pietersen, Flintoff and, perhaps, Paul Collingwood and Stuart Broad, to play for three weeks in the IPL.         
	Bending to the players wishes over IPL may win their loyalty as well as their signatures upon those mouldering central contracts, but it could yet have a downside for Strauss should those involved be unable to raise a gallop for him on their return.         
	Just witness some of the recent lame performances from the Australians involved in last years IPL. Crickets Pandoras Box may be brimming with easy money but there is clearly a price to pay.         
	Handing responsibility to the players, and the less is more approach to interference from coaches, has several roots for Strauss. The oldest comes from his close association to Duncan Fletcher, who chose to work on specifics with batsmen only if they wanted to.         
	The coaches will play more of an advisory role, confirmed Strauss. Its vitally important that players are challenged to think for themselves. The more we do that, the more we will find that out in the middle people will do the right things.         
	The other reasons come from Strausss own recent experience in regaining his form, where he worked things out for himself, and the way England came into the Chennai Test in India fairly cold and dominated the match until the post-lunch session on the penultimate day. Inspiration rather than perspiration until Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar out-sparked them.         
	The physical bruising will come when Pietersen faces the potent West Indies Test attack of Daren Powell, Jerome Taylor and Fidel Edwards, but there are one or two unseen pains that need sorting before then.         
	Strauss knows this, which is no doubt why he has included him in that other Fletcher favourite, the players management group, for the one-day series.         
	When you have been under the pressure Kevin has recently, its easy to react in a number of different ways, admitted Strauss.         
	Where I was pleasantly surprised was that he reacted in the way we all wanted him to, to show that he is fully committed to playing for England. He will go on to play a very, very important role on and off the pitch.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | NSW Blues want Yuvi
                                                   NSW Blues want Yuvi
                      
	New Delhi: Yuvraj Singhs exploits in the shortest format have grabbed the attention of Australian state side New South Wales Blues, who want to rope in the stylish southpaw for their domestic T20 tournament.         
	According to a top NSW player, the management is likely to contact Yuvraj and try getting him on board for the T20 tournament, which runs from December 28 of this year to January 23, 2010.         
	Hes a great player, and hes been magnificent in conditions across the world, so, if we can get him, itll give us a great chance at the title, the unnamed cricketer told a TV sports network.         
	Captain of the Kings XI Punjab, Yuvraj scored 415 runs from 15 matches at an average of 34.58 and a strike-rate of 160.85 over the two editions of the Indian Premier League apart from capturing two hattricks.         
	Overall, in 57 T20 Internationals, Yuvraj has scored 1380 runs at a strike-rate of 138.27 and bagged 20 wickets.         
	NSW are the 2008-09 Big Bash champions, and are currently in India for the Champions League T20.         
	The team boasts of many Australia internationals but ten of their 36-member squad for the season are bound by Cricket Australia contracts.         
	The Blues have also shown an interest in signing Pakistan all-rounder Shahid Afridi and Sri Lanka skipper Kumar Sangakkara.         
	Yuvraj is currently out of action because of an injury which forced him out of the Champions Trophy.         
	The elegant southpaw, who is the vice-captain of India in ODIs, is currently ranked second in the one-dayers behind captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Yuvraj equalled a world record in the inaugural World Twenty20 in South Africa in 2007, hitting six sixes in one over off Englands Stuart Broad.         
	Even though Kings XI Punjab have not done anything special under the Punjab batsman in the first two editions of the IPL, Yuvraj has been quite successful himself.         
	Of late, he has become a quite a handful with his left-arm spin which adds to his utility as a cricketer in the shorter forms of the game. (PTI)

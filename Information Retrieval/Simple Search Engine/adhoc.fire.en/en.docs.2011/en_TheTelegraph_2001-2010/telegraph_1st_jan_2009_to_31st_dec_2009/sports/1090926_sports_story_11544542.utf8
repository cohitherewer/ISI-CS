    - Pakistan debate over Mohammed Asifs inclusion in key clash           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Johannesburg: Even as New Delhi and Islamabad continue to joust for political and diplomatic points, the cricket score between India and Pakistan will be settled in the now rather bustling Centurion.         
	Saturdays match, the ongoing Champion Trophys derby fixture, will be the first after Mumbais 26/11, a terror outrage which has (again) halted bilateral cricket exchanges.         
	As things have turned out, then, neighbouring Centurion is playing neutral host and a capacity crowd is expected. The Cricket Stadium there had played the same role in the 2003 World Cup.         
	While Team India would love a similar result (a six-wicket win which took them to the Super Six stage), Pakistan must be praying for a change in fortune in mega events.         
	Theres a lot riding over the scheduled 100 overs.         
	Both captains, significantly, have been trying to play down the emotional content of the match. The reasons are understandable.         
	Look, the rivalry is and will be there, but I wouldnt like the pressure to get to the team... Rather, we should enjoy the moment, pointed out Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	He added: At the end of the day, the cricket played is the same, though the intensity is more... If we think too much and focus too much on one team alone, then the chances of success come down.         
	Opposite number Younis Khan, who wishes to emulate Sachin Tendulkars stupendous effort (98 off 75 balls) in 2003, said much the same thing.         
	The pressure, clearly, is more on India: Dhoni and Co. launch their campaign as the No.1 team in limited overs cricket  Pakistan are three spots lower.         
	Expectations are more, but one can only control what is possible to be controlled... Weve got to play to potential and execute our plans well. If thats done, then we will win... As for Pakistan, the team is capable of beating any side, Dhoni commented.         
	Asked if he recalled the 2003 face off, Dhoni replied: I do... Id watched that exciting and special match...         
	Actually, it was a classic and the way Sachin decimated Shoaib Akhtar, in particular, is part of World Cup folklore.         
	Dhoni conceded that vice-captain Yuvraj Singhs injury, on Wednesday, had hurt the team hard. Yuvis been an asset and the pillar on whom weve relied in the middle overs... Well be missing the bowler in him, too... Three part-timers (Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj, Rohit Sharma) arent around... Hopefully, somebody will put his hand up and do the job...         
	With match-winners like Sehwag and Yuvraj not available, the ask has got tougher. At the same time, their absence gives others the chance to showcase their abilities.         
	Defending the choice of Virat Kohli as Yuvrajs replacement, Dhoni said: Im happy that hes here... This is an ideal opportunity for him... A big stage... A big platform...         
	However, he lamented the absence of a bowling all-rounder.         
	Till late on Friday, the Team India XI hadnt been finalised. Dhoni, though, ruled out fielding five specialist bowlers. Thats a luxury...         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, the scenario was as uncertain in the Pakistan camp. One change simply has to be made, as Younis has decided to play despite a hairline fracture.         
	The biggest debate is over Mohammed Asif... Initially, it was almost certain that he would play, but the regular quicks have been bowling well and dropping any one of them would be unfair... So, Asif may have to wait for his comeback, is what one source revealed.         
	Having beaten the West Indies on Wednesday, Pakistans account has already opened.         
	Match starts: 6 pm (IST).

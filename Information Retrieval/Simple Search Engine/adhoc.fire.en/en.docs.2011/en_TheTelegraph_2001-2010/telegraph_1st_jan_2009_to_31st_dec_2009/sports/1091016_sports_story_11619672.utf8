  - Diego Maradona turns on his critics, throws future as coach in doubt       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Argentinas Mario Bolatti celebrates after scoring against Uruguay in their World Cup qualifier in Montevideo on Wednesday. (Reuters)                                 
	Diego Maradona hit out at critics of his coaching after his Argentina team qualified for the World Cup and said he had issues to discuss with his boss. For those who didnt believe in this national team, for those who treated me like garbage (I say) on Wednesday we are in the World Cup with all the honours, beating a team like Uruguay, Maradona said.         
	Argentina secured their berth at the 2010 finals in South Africa with a 1-0 away win over archrivals Uruguay at the Centenario, scene of the first World Cup final in 1930. Substitute midfielder Mario Bolatti stabbed home the only goal five minutes from the end of a tense, foul-riddled match, ending Uruguays hopes of a victory that would have put them through.         
	I am black or white, Ill never be grey in my life, Maradona, who in Argentine eyes could do no wrong as a player, told reporters as he criticised the media for inventing stories about differences within the national team staff.         
	Maradona has been under fire for most of the qualifying matches since he took charge a year ago, for inconsistencies in selection and tactical errors that left Argentina on the brink of missing qualification.         
	He lost four matches and won four, including the last two against Peru and Uruguay that left Argentina in the last of South Americas four automatic qualifying berths behind Brazil, Paraguay and Chile.         
	Fifth-placed Uruguay have their playoff next month against Costa Rica, of the Concacaf region, for another place.         
	A week ago, Maradona gave the impression there were divisions in the national team staff, suggesting to reporters in Buenos Aires that preparations to face Peru on Saturday had not run smoothly. He said he would only stay on for the finals on his terms, but a few days later accused the media of inventing his possible resignation.         
	On Wednesday, he allowed a similar doubt to fill the air when, in answer to a question about whether he would be in charge of Argentina in South Africa, Maradona would only say: I need to talk to (Argentine Football Association president Julio) Grondona.         
	Maradona celebrated on the touchline after the goal and wept and hugged members of his coaching staff at the final whistle, a spontaneous outpouring of emotion that signalled an end to months of anxiety.         
	And the coach knew how close it was with the home players willing to give no quarter.         
	Uruguay defender Martin Caceres was sent off in the 81st minute for bringing down Jonas Gutierrez, his second yellow card offence. His teammate Cristian Rodriguez was sent off right at the end, four minutes into stoppage time, for violent conduct. But Argentina, who had struggled with the inexperience of Maradona as coach and his inconsistencies in selection, survived some early scares.         
	However, the visitors took control with some precise passing in midfield looking for the telling breakthrough.         
	Muslera went down to save at striker Gonzalo Higuains feet from Lionel Messis pass and Uruguay captain Diego Lugano headed wide at the other end.         
	The breakthrough came when Bolatti, who had come on for Higuain five minutes earlier in his first qualifier and only his third international, found the net from close range following Verons ball into a packed area from the left.

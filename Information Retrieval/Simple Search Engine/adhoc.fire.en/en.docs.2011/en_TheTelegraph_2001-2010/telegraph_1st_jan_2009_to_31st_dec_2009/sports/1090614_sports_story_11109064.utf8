The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvi is such a quality player: Gayle
                                                   Yuvi is such a quality player: Gayle
                      
	The following are excerpts from what the West Indies captain, Chris Gayle, said after leading his team to a memorable win over India:         
	Defeating the reigning champions         
	Yeah, we were up against a quality team... They almost defended 153 and, so, credit to India... Somebody (Yuvraj Singh) stepped up and gave them a decent total.         
	Yuvrajs innings         
	Some guys make runs and hurt teams... Hes such a quality player, someone who has hit six sixes in an over (in the inaugural World T20)...         
	Hostile spells at the start         
	Fidel Edwards was very good and fast... He did his job (three for 24)...         
	Finally, the difference made by his teams fielding         
	It did, yes, and the catch that (Lendl) Simmons took off (Gautam) Gambhir was outstanding.           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT IN LONDON

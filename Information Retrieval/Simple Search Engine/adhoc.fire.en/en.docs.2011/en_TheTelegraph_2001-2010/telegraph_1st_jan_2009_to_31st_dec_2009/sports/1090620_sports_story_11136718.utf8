                                                   Afridi thanks skipper for his support
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nottingham: Shahid Afridi spoke to the media after their seven-run victory over South Africa in the semi-final of the World Twenty20 on Thursday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	If he was ready to bat up the order         
	The main thing is, Younis (Khan) has always supported me and asked me to be ready to bat higher up in the order. Thats exactly what I needed from the captain. The coach, too, was appreciative of the idea. Inshallah, Ill be ready for the final as well.         
	What was the plan when he went into bat on Thursday?         
	In the last two games, I tried to stay at the wicket and go for the singles. Younis asked me to go ahead and play my own game. He said there was no pressure on me. After that, I felt much better. Yeah, in the last three-and-a-half years, Ive not played well, because I shifted my focus from batting to bowling. But the team needed me with the bat today (Thursday).         
	What did Younis tell him?         
	Take your time to settle down, be responsible as a senior is what Younis said to me. You are my main player, he said.

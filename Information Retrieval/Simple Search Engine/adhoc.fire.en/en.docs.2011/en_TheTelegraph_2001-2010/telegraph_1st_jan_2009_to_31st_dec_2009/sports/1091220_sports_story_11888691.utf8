The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Call made to clear confusion
                                                                                                                       7                                        Call made to clear confusion

	Nagpur: Chief selector Krishnamachari Srikkanth is understood to have talked with Virender Sehwag, over the telephone, before the Board announced that hed be the stand-in captain for the next two ODIs against Sri Lanka.         
	That, it seems, was done to clear the confusion caused by a Sehwag interview to a TV channel, not too long ago, when he was recovering from shoulder surgery.         
	Sehwag didnt say anything to the Board, but that interview, where he favoured a younger player being groomed for the captaincy, did lead to confusion... Thats why Srikkanth is learnt to have first spoken to him (on Saturday morning), a top source in the Board told The Telegraph.         
	Had Sehwag, who was a stand-in captain more than once in 2005-06 and earlier this year as well, declined to lead, then both Yuvraj Singh and Gautam Gambhir wouldve come into the picture.         
	Yuvraj, incidentally, has been declared fit to play in Cuttack on Monday. For different reasons, he missed the first two matches.

                                                   Dhoni: Need to be consistent
                      
	Kingston: The World Twenty20 debacle is still fresh on their minds, and a wounded India will be desperate to avenge their recent defeat against the West Indies when the four-match ODI series gets underway here Friday.         
	The Indians, who suffered a seven-wicket thrashing at the hands of Chris Gayles men in the World T20 in England, has now regrouped for the 50-over format after a nine-day break from competitive cricket.         
	The squad is without Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag and Zaheer Khan, who are nursing various injuries, but promises to put up a good show with the return of pacer Ashish Nehra and some new faces.         
	The Indian team is packed with all-rounders in Yusuf Pathan and Ravindra Jadeja besides the likes of Yuvraj Singh, Gautam Gambhir and Rohit Sharma.         
	Their bowling department, as admitted by West Indies batsman Ramnaresh Sarwan, will be the main concern for the home side, especially the spinners.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who has vowed to bring the smiles back on the faces of the Indian fans, has already made it clear to the opposition that his team was not short on confidence and had the wherewithal to challenge the West Indies. When it comes to playing for your country you dont really need motivation to go out and perform, Dhoni said.         
	The West Indies are playing good cricket at the moment. They had a very good World Twenty20 tournament, but in the 50 overs, you have time to settle down, he said.         
	Dhoni believes consistency would be the key to success in the series, which begins at the slow Sabina Park track. The team that plays consistent cricket over the series will come out as winners. We have to play consistent cricket and I think that will be the key for us, Dhoni said.         
	The West Indies, seemingly resurgent following their semi-final berth in the World T20, are not taking the Indians lightly though. Chris Gayle and Co had lost their last series in England.         
	India is always a good one-day team and they will be looking to beat us based on their Twenty20 disappointment. Sehwag and Tendulkar are two world class players but they still have quality players to step up and they have a lot of experience in one-day cricket, Gayle said.

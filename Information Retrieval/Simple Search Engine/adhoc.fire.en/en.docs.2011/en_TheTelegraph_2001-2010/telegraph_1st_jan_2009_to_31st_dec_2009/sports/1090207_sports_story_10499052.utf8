The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chetri: Wasnt rejected 
                                                   Chetri: Wasnt rejected 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Coventry City havent rejected me. Theyve only said that two-and-a-half days are too short to assess somebodys ability. Thats why I wasnt selected, East Bengal forward Sunil Chetri told reporters Friday.         
	Chetri thought this clarification was necessary as there has been a lot of speculation about the reason behind his returning empty-handed from England.         
	I was surprised and hurt to know that people thought Coventry had rejected me. Let me make it clear that I was there for only two-and-a-half days and the club had a match during that period. So they could not give me much time, Chetri said.         
	Asked if he has been invited for another trial in summer, Chetri said: Not just Coventry. Ill be going for trials at some other clubs too, not only in England, but also in other European countries.         
	Chetri was of the opinion that there is not much difference between Indian footballers and those who play the Football League Championship (the second tier of English league football) as far as skill is concerned.         
	The difference between us is just physical. The shortest player of Coventry is around 59. Otherwise, there is not much to choose between us. Many Indian footballers would do well there, Chetri said.

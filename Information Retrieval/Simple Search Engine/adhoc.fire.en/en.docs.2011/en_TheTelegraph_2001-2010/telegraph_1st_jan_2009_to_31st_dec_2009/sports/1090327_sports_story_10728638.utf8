The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand slips to joint 2nd
                                                   Anand slips to joint 2nd
                      
	Nice: A rare queen blunder against Russian Alexander Morozevich cost world champion Viswanathan Anand dearly as he lost the lead in the 10th and penultimate round in the Amber blindfold and rapid chess tournament here.         
	It was roughly a balanced middle game position in the blindfold game when Anand went for a long calculation and erroneously played a queen move that was supposed to be the second move in his plan.         
	The Indian ace drew the return rapid game and remained in contention for top honours even as Levon Aronian of Armenia jumped to sole lead at the expense of Chinese Wang Yue by a 1.5-0.5 margin.         
	The shock of the day was registered by Vladimir Kramnik of Russia who defeated overnight joint leader Magnus Carlsen of Norway 1.5-0.5, winning the blindfold game in just 20 moves with black pieces.         
	As things stand with just a round to go, Aronian has 13 points while Anand and Carlsen, a full point behind the Armenian, are now joint second in the combined standings. Kramnik is sole fourth on 11.5 points while Hungarian Peter Leko is a distant fifth with 10 points. Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine, shares the 6th spot along with Gata Kamksy of the US, Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria and Morozevich and this group is a half point clear of Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine.         
	Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan is 11th in the 12-players tournament on 8 points while Wang Yue was at the bottom with 7 points in his bag.         
	Despite losing the blindfold game against Kramnik, Carlsen remained in sole lead in this section on 7 points.           (PTI)

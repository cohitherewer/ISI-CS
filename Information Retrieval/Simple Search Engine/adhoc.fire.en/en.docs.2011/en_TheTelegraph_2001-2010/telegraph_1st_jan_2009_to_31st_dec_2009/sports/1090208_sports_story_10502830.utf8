	Bangalore: S. Padmanabhan-trained Icebreaker (David Allan-up) may win the 2,400m Poonawalla Bangalore Derby, here on Sunday. The tremendously improved filly had the measure of her rivals in the Bangalore Oaks over the Derby trip. The other major contender is Fleeting Arrow (Sam Fargeat-up) who has proven his mettle over the metric mile and has been unbeaten so far. His recent mock-race over 2000m brings him into strong contention.

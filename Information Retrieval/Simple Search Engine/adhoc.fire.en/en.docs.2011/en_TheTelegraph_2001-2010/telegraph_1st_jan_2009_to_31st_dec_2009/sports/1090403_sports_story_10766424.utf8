                                                   Sourav: Time to move on
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly feels that the controversy surrounding John Buchanans multiple-captain theory will not have any effect on the teams preparations for the forthcoming Indian Premier League.         
	I dont think this will have an adverse effect on the teams morale. We all are professionals and we all have a responsibility. We all have a job to do in South Africa and we have definitely put all those controversies behind Its time to move on, Sourav said at a function organised to announce the Nokia Sprite para cricket series on Thursday.         
	Sourav said every team goes through some controversies and comes out stronger.         
	On Kolkata being dropped from the KKR logo, Sourav said that might have been done since the tournament was being held in South Africa. Kolkata is still very much part of the Knight Riders. And next year when the tournament returns to India you will get to see Kolkata coming back, he said.         
	Sourav said he had no problem whatsoever with Bloemfontein being the team base. Its a lovely city and have great facilities. Our physical trainer Adrian le Roux is from that part of South Africa and he has spoken highly about the facilities being available there, he added.

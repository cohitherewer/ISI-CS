The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan not expecting walk in park
                                                   Bagan not expecting walk in park
            A STAFF REPORTER                                      Bencharifa    
	Calcutta: Karim Bencharifa feels Wednesays IFA Shield semi-final, against city rivals Chirag United, on Salt Lake Stadiums newly-laid artificial turf, will be a 50-50 affair.         
	Given their brilliant run in the ongoing tournament, the Mohun Bagan coach considers Chirag one of the principal contenders.         
	They are a very good side. The players are in good form they are one of the contenders for the title, Karim said after the teams practice session at the Salt Lake Stadium Tuesday.         
	And considering the way they have played so far I feel the semi-final is evenly poised, the Moroccan added.         
	Although Bagan have not done too badly themselves, Karim said his team will be going in with a cautious approach.         
	Edeh Chidi, the lone striker against in Sundays match against Mahindra United, is likely to be partnered by K. Kulothungan upfront. At the heart of the midfield, there will be Marcos Pereira, Snehasish Chakraborty, James Singh and Micky Fernandes.         
	In order to keep the Chirag strike-duo of Joshimar and Parveen Kumar in check, Karim will be sticking to Deepak Mondal, Rakesh Masih, Surkumar Singh and N. Mohanraj in defence.         
	Whether it will be Sangram Mukherjee or Shilton Paul under the bar was still not decided. However, Bencharifa said he had been impressed by Shiltons performance in the Mahindra match.         
	As to adjusting to the artificial surface, Bencharifa said it was not his exclusive worry. The bounce is different and I believe it would be difficult for the players to read the bounce. But, it will be the same for both teams. All 22 players will need time to settle down, the Moroccan opined.         
	Chirag are likely to miss the services of Malswamtlunga but coach Subrata Bhattacharya was more worried about the refereeing. We have nothing to prove. My boys are well prepared and are raring to go. But I am scared of the refereeing. The referee can make mistakes under pressure and that affects the outcome of a match, Subrata said.         
	Other than Shylo Malswamtlunga, who is down with fever, Bhattacharya has a full squad to choose from.         
	I have nothing to prove. I just have to win and prove some Bagan officials wrong, Subrata, the former Bagan coach, said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Moises named standby
                                                   Moises named standby
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Moises Henriques, member of the victorious New South Wales Blues side that won the inaugural Champions League T20, will join the injury-hit Australian squad as a standby player for the remainder of their tour of India, Cricket Australias National Selection Panel (NSP) confirmed Tuesday.         
	The 22-year-old Henriques appeared in the Kolkata Knight Riders colours in the second edition of the IPL in South Africa.         
	Injuries to three main players  Brett Lee, James Hopes and Mitchell Johnson  is a blow potentially damaging to their campaign in the seven-match ODI series and, with Lee and Hopes ruled out for the Wednesdays ODI at Nagpur and the latter doubtful for the third match as well, NSP chairman Andrew Hilditch said adding a standby player to the squad is a necessity.         
	The decision to draft Henriques into the effort would have been helped by the youngsters ability to perform with both bat and ball.         
	Henriques will arrive in Delhi Wednesday and join the squad when it reaches the city a day later.

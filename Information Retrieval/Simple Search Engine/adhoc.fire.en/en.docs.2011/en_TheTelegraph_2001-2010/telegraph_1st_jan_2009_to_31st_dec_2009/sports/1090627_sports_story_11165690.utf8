  -   Gautam Gambhirs poor run continues; Karthik contributes 67               Dinesh Karthik en route to his 67 during the first ODI against the West Indies at Sabina Park in Kingston on Friday. (AFP)                           
	Kingston: Yuvraj Singh hit a sublime 131 and Dinesh Karthik smashed a brilliant 67 to propel India to a solid 339 for six against the West Indies in the first one-day International Friday.         
	The duo put together a 135-run stand for the third wicket to resurrect Indias innings, which was rocked by short-pitched bowling after the visitors had elected to bat at Sabina Park.         
	Early dismissals of Gautam Gambhir (13) and Rohit Sharma (4) had left India reeling at 32 for two but Yuvraj and Karthik batted with patience to steady the innings and build a solid platform for a big total.         
	After guiding his side to a safe position, Yuvraj started clobbering the Windies bowlers as he hit seven sixes and 10 fours in his 102-ball knock. This was the southpaws 12th ODI century.         
	He hit Jerome Taylor and Chris Gayle each for two sixes and also added 86 runs for the fourth wicket with skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who contributed 41 runs before being run out.         
	Yuvraj batted fearlessly as he hit Lionel Baker for two fours and a six to reach 98 and then stole a single off Taylor to bring up his century.         
	Just when the Punjab player was threatening to take India to a total beyond the hosts reach, Dwayne Bravo dealt the visitors a twin blow by dismissing Yuvraj and Ravinder Jadeja (0) off successive balls in the 39th over.         
	Yuvrajs innings came to an end when he nicked one off Bravo onto the leg-side for stumper Denesh Ramdin to take a splendid diving catch.         
	Yusuf Pathan (40 off 38) hit the first ball of the last over for a six and Harbhajan Singh (21 off 13) smashed the last one into the crowd.         
	Earlier, Gambhir and Karthik, who has switched to the openers role in the absence of the injured Virender Sehwag, gave a steady start to India, adding 25 for the first wicket.         
	However, Gambhirs lean patch continued, as he could not build on the start and fell to a short-pitch delivery from Taylor. Surprised by the bounce, the left-hander mistimed a pull shot that was caught by Dwayne Bravo.         
	Taylor was part of the attack that exploited Indias weakness against the rising delivery during the World Twenty20 and he resorted to the approach once again though the Sabina Park pitch was far slower than the one at Lords.         
	He hurried the batsmen with pace, beat them with seam movement, and proved extremely hard to score off during his first spell by giving nothing to drive or cut.         
	Unfortunately for the West Indies, the pressure Taylor created dissipated because no one provided taylor enough support from the other end with Lionel Baker, Dwayne Bravo and David Bernard unable to bowl economically.         
	Rohit Sharma (4) became the second victim of the short-pitched stuff as he tried to pull one off Baker but just managed a top-edge to Bravo in the square-leg region.         
	Yuvraj and Karthik relied more on ones and twos initially to steady the rocking ship. But once they got their eye in, and the spinners were introduced, the runs started flowing from their blades.         
	Yuvraj first hoicked Gayle for a huge six over mid-wicket and then meted out the same treatment to Suleiman Benn to bring up the 100-run partnership.         
	Karthik hit six boundaries in his 77-ball effort.         
	The Indians were determined to forget memories of their 2007 World Cup campaign on this tour. They had crashed out of the World Cup in the first week itself after embarrassing defeats at the hands of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.         
	Of course, it is not an easy thing to forget, especially that 2007 World Cup. It is always tough to forget that kind of tournament. It will be important for us to do well here, Dhoni said ahead of the match.         
	A year before the World Cup debacle, the team was thrashed 4-1 by the hosts in an ODI series. The Indian team came into the series after a disappointing World Twenty20 campaign where the defending champions failed to even make the semi-finals.         
	Dhoni also predicted the series to be hard-fought and was kept his fingers crossed for the weather to hold up.         
	Our aim is to win this series and keep on improving our world rankings, said Dhoni.

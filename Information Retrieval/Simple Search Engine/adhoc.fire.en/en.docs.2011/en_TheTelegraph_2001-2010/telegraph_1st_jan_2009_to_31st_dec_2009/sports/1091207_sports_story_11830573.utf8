The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lack of reviews hurt us: Kumar
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lack of reviews hurt us: Kumar
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara has criticised ICCs decision not to include the Umpire Decision Review System in the Test series against India.         
	This series was probably the best advertisement for the review system, when decisions cost us over 500 runs and a lot of wickets, Sangakkara said.         
	It always puts a lot of pressure on the side. We were outplayed but not to have the review system when every other side in the world is using it, that becomes an extra handicap.         
	It cost us quite a few runs in this Test and the last.         
	Team India counterpart Mahendra Singh Dhoni was more diplomatic on the issue.         
	It is very difficult to say because I havent played in a single series that had the review system, Dhoni said.         
	I dont think it is 100 per cent foolproof yet, but at the same time, it cant be foolproof if you are not trying it.         
	It has its own advantages and disadvantages.         
	What happens is that, if you are at the receiving end, you will say it is not good.         
	But at the same time, if your spinners are getting wickets because of the review system you will be favouring it

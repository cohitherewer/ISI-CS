The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No total   is safe: Dhoni 
                                                                                                                       7                                        No total   is safe: Dhoni 
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni                                 
	Nagpur: Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the Team India captain, spoke to the media in general and to The Telegraph separately on Thursday afternoon.         
	Dhoni was absolutely relaxed, the recent successes definitely contributing to his present state of mind.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Whether theres a safe total in an ODI         
	One cant afford to relax... Because of T20, theres no total which is safe. One can, perhaps, assess the situation after the first 10 overs have been bowled (in session No.2)...         
	If hed watched the history-creating South Africa-Australia ODI, at the Wanderers, on the TV         
	No.         
	Whether Sri Lankas aggressive response in Rajkot took him by surprise         
	No... The wicket there gets better and I knew that they would go for it if their start was good... They started well and went for the target (415).         
	If the day isnt far off when 500 will be touched         
	Would be difficult, I think... The wicket would come into play... Actually, we should have got it in Rajkot... After 30 overs, we were 261 for one and its generally believed that the score gets doubled, in the remaining 20...         
	Indias highest in ODIs having been registered in Rajkot         
	Yes, but well be starting the next match from scratch... We dont, usually, get such wickets... It wasnt a big ground... Had we scored 20-30 more, it wouldve been an entirely different story... As it turned out, despite 410-plus, we won by just three runs.         
	The wicket in (neighbouring) Jamtha         
	Looks flat and good.         
	Curators preparing flat wickets         
	They try their best... Preparing wickets isnt easy... Theres no formula to prepare a good wicket... Its very easy to criticise... The wicket during the (recent) Kanpur Test was flat, yet the match finished with a day-and-a-half to spare.         
	On Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehras bowling at the death in Rajkot         
	Probably bowled the best in the past year... Ashish bowled five on the trot...There was a bit of reverse swing and that helped... Every run counts and its important not to give away even one or two... One has to constantly update plans and international cricket demands that you improvise... (Even) A captain cant stick to certain fields, cant persist with a deep third-man or a deep fine-leg.         
	Catches being dropped         
	Yes, weve been dropping catches and its a botheration... Were working hard and, at some point, it should be sorted out.         
	Mike Young being absent         
	Hes gone to (Mumbai) to work with the U-19 boys         
	The toss         
	If your bowling is weak, then you look to chase... You may also want to give your batsmen the freedom (by batting first)... There are positives and negatives...         
	Whether dew could be a factor in Jamtha         
	Not that much... I spoke to the curator (Pravin Hingnikar) and he said hed been observing it for the past couple of days and it wasnt significant. Of course, one expects dew at this time of the year.         
	Muttiah Muralidharan and Dilhara Fernando having returned home         
	Its an opportunity for the players who have come (as replacements)... Murali is a great bowler, whatever the format, and Sri Lanka will feel his absence... Dilhara is a good bowler at the death... Has pace... Has the slower one, too.         
	Update on Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh         
	Sehwag is fit... Yuvraj has flu... As of now, its just flu (not swine flu).         
	Finally, having effected 200 dismissals         
	(Smiles) Oh, Im very happy... More than the 200, Im delighted that Ive now got 51 victims through stumpings. Its a really good feeling, yes... It also shows that our spinners have been doing a good job.

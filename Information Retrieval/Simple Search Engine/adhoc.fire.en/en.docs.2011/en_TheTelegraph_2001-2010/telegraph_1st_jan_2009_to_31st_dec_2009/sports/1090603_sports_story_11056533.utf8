The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India look to hit form vs Pak
                                                     India look to hit form vs Pak
                  Ishant Sharma                     
	London: India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni would need pluck and luck in equal measure to score a consolation win against Pakistan in a warm-up match for the ICC World Twenty20 Wednesday.         
	The tie has been designated as Catch the Spirit match following a recommendation by the ICC. The proceeds of the match will go to the families of the victims of the Lahore terror attacks         
	Dhonis men lost their first warm-up match to New Zealand Monday and are up against an opponent who consider themselves unlucky to have lost the two previous encounters between the two sides.         
	Both the previous ties were in the inaugural edition in 2007 and India crossing the line was a matter of chance.         
	Indians prevailed in the first through a bowl-out after the match ended in a tie. In the 2007 final in Johannesburg, Pakistan were just a stroke away from victory when Misbah-ul Haqs scoop off Joginder Sharma landed in Sreesanths hands at short fine-leg.         
	Pakistan would be determined to settle scores for they might not get another opportunity to get even with the Indians unless this time, again, both sides make it to the final.         
	Indians would be resigned to leaving Zaheer Khan and Virender Sehwag on the bench as both are battling shoulder injuries.         
	However, they would be keen to play Yuvraj Singh who is just about recovering from a bout of food poisoning, as disclosed by skipper Dhoni Monday night. Fast bowler Rudra Pratap Singh could have another game to get into rhythm after the pasting in the first warm-up.         
	Irfan Pathan would be hoping for a few more overs under his belt, as would Praveen Kumar and Yusuf Pathan. Ishant Sharma would look to build on his superb success from the first game. Opener Gautam Gambhir and Dhoni would have another opportunity to spend some time in the middle and be in a better frame of mind before the tournament kicks off Friday.         
	Pakistan, who lost their first warm-up match against South Africa, could field 17-year-old fast-bowling sensation Mohammed Aamer tipped by Wasim Akram to be the revelation of this tournament.         
	Aamer, a tall and skinny lad from the Punjab province of Pakistan, regularly hits upwards of 140kmph and he could form a formidable fast bowling trio with Umar Gul and Sohail Tanvir.         
	Gul and Tanvir are star bowlers in this format. Gul was the highest wicket taker in the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup while Tanvir was the best bowler of the IPLs inaugural edition.

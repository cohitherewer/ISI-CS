The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhaichung praise for Houghton
                                                   Bhaichung praise for Houghton
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India and Mohun Bagan captain Bhaichung Bhutia on Sunday slammed Indian coaches of being partial as he showered praises on national coach Bob Houghton for his professional approach to the job.         
	Talking about the All India Football Federations ambitious Goal 2011 plan, Bhutia said: I wouldnt like to comment on the matter as we havent been informed officially yet. Bob Houghton too didnt say anything about it.         
	Then, speaking about Houghton, he added: Neither do I have Bobs phone number nor he mine. In fact, he has none of the players number and that is good. We only interact on the ground. He maintains a certain detachment from the footballers, which ensures his neutrality as a coach. In India, coaches often show favouritism towards certain players. But no one can blame Bob on that count. Even the players who dont get a chance in the first XI cant accuse Bob because he treats everyone equally. His method is exemplary.         
	Bhutia was speaking after their practice session on Sunday. Bagan will be locking horns with Al Wehdat of Jordan in an AFC Cup encounter on Tuesday at the Howrah Stadium.         
	Mohun Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa had earlier said that his priority was not the AFC Cup, but the I-league and that he would be trying out different combinations against the Jordanian club.

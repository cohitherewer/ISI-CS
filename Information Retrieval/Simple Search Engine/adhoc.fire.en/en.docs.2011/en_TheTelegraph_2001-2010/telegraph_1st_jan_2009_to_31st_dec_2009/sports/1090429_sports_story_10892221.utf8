                                                   Sarkar to be back in SA
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Durban: Bengals right-arm medium-pacer Sourav Sarkar, whod been sent home after the Kolkata Knight Riders camp in Bloemfontein, has been called back.         
	Sarkar has been asked to rush as we arent sure how long Anureet Singh will take to recover, a member of the team management told The Telegraph.         
	The medium-pacer left Calcutta on Tuesday evening and is expected to reach here before the Knights leave for East London.         
	Sarkar wont be considered for Wednesdays match against the Royal Challengers Bangalore.         
	Singh pulled a muscle in his right thigh in the very first over of the match against the Mumbai Indians, on Monday.         
	The Railwayman looked in considerable pain while travelling from Port Elizabeth to Durban.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spanish coach for India
                                                   Spanish coach for India
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       
	New Delhi: The days of Harendra Singh as the national coach seem numbered as the ad hoc committee for hockey is all set to appoint a foreign coach by the end of this month.         
	Though the name of the coach has been kept secret, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) sources said that an experienced coach from Spain has already been chosen by the ad hoc committee.         
	We have chosen a Spanish coach, who is an FIH Masters degree holder, and have forwarded his name to the sports ministry for clearance, said an IOA official.         
	He should be here by the end of this month.         
	Sources said that the Spanish coach would take over as the national coach immediately after the four-nation tournament to be played in Chandigarh from January 31 to February 9.         
	Olympic champions Germany , the Netherlands and New Zealand, who replaced Pakistan, are the other participants in the meet.         
	The new coach will take charge irrespective of the result of the Chandigarh tournament.         
	The coach is likely to stay till the next Asian Games, a source informed.         
	Initially it was believed that a coach from the Netherlands would be India s national coach. But the IOA insiders said that the recent change in the FIH leadership has prompted Indian hockey authorities to opt for a Spanish coach.         
	 Till November, the FIH was headed by the Netherlands Els van Breda Vriesman, who was believed to be interested in getting a Dutch coach for India , an official said.         
	But now that Leandro Negre of Spain has taken over as the president of the FIH, a Spanish coach seems to have been given priority.

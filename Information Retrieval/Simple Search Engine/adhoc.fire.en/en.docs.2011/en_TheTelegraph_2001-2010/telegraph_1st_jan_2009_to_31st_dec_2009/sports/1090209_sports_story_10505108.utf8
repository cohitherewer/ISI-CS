The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Higuain seals Real win 
                                                   Higuain seals Real win 
                      
	Madrid: A clinical finish by Gonzalo Higuain gave Real Madrid a 1-0 home win over Racing Santander on Saturday and a seventh successive Primera Liga victory that trimmed Barcelonas lead at the top to nine points.         
	Third-placed Sevilla lost further ground on Real after goals from Sergio Garcia and new signing Ricardo Oliveira gave Real Betis a 2-1 win at the Sanchez Pizjuan and condemned their city rivals to a third consecutive league defeat.         
	Champions Real have 47 points from 22 matches behind Barcelona. Sevilla are third on 38 while Betis move up to 13th with 25, easing the pressure on under-fire coach Paco Chaparro, and Racing stay 10th with 28.         
	Argentine forward Higuain grabbed the only goal at the Bernabeu when he raced on to Rauls headed pass, turned inside a sliding challenge from Cesar Navas and clipped the ball over Racing goalkeeper Tono into the far corner.         
	Meanwhile, in Milan, Inter Milan stretched their Serie A lead to eight points after the champions won 3-0 at Lecce and AC Milan could only draw 1-1 at home to bottom side Reggina on Saturday.         
	Reggina went ahead on 33 minutes when Davide Di Gennaro fired in after Bernardo Corradis assist.         
	Kaka equalised with a 67th-minute penalty but soon went off with an injured foot and is taken to hospital for tests. The Brazilian also hit the post and Clarence Seedorf had a goal ruled out when he used his hand to net the rebound.

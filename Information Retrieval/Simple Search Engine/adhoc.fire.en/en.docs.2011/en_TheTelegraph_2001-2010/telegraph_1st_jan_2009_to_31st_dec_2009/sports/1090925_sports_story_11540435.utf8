                                                     Younis Khan: I will play against India
    - After nets, pak captain relaxes by watching ashs mistress of spices           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Younis Khan                                 
	Johannesburg: Back in his hotel room after a decent hit at the afternoon nets, Younis Khan was watching Aishwarya Rai Bachchans Mistress of Spices, a Hollywood production, before the evening namaaz and an early dinner.         
	The Pakistan captain, who is nursing a hairline fracture on the little finger of the right hand, couldnt have been more relaxed. That, too, with the Champions Trophy match against India a mere two days away.         
	But, then, thats Younis  a Pathan with a difference.         
	The pain has almost gone and, while some discomfort is there, Ill play on Saturday... Ive decided to take a chance, taki baad mein koi kuch na bole, Younis told The Telegraph at the Sandton Sun.         
	Younis injured himself in the build up to the tournament and didnt play Pakistans opener, against an under-strength West Indies, here on Wednesday.         
	Earlier in the day, on Thursday, coach Intikhab Alam had left it to Younis to decide on playing the India match. Hes shaping up well, but Ive left it to him... Hell have to take the call, Intikhab said.         
	The Younis-Intikhab partnership, it may be recalled, helped Pakistan win the World T20 in June and, clearly, they understand each other well.         
	In Youniss absence, Shahid Afridi led Pakistan to a five-wicket win. Given the quality of the opposition and the target (134), it should have come easier, though.         
	Afridi, the T20 captain, won his first match in that role in the shortest form, too  in Sri Lanka, at the start of this season.         
	Yes, Ive got an all-win record... Jeetna sabse zaroori hota hai... Am I looking forward to being the regular captain in all forms? Ill only say that Im happy playing under Younis, Afridi maintained, speaking exclusively.         
	At 29, Afridi is a veteran and would like to make the most of all opportunities. Hes been around for 13 years.

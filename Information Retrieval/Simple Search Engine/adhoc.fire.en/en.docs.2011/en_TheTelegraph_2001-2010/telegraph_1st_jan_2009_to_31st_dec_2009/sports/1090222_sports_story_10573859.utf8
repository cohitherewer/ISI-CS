                                                   In football, as in life, nothing is impossible: Bhowmick
  - Emotions run high on eve of crucial I-League derby
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Subhas Bhowmick is spitting fire. On the eve of East Bengals I-League derby clash against Mohun Bagan, Bhowmick was at his rhetorical best during the press conference at the club tent.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q Your thoughts on the eve of Sundays match?         
	A It is no different from what it is on the eve of any other match. The way my team prepared for Vasco, against Bagan its much the same. Every team in the I-League deserves respect.         
	East Bengal have not won against Bagan in the last nine matches. Will that have an impact?         
	Those things dont count. Whoever plays better on the day and makes fewer mistakes, will win. It has been like this since the first derby. Also, the wheel has to turn. Isnt it?         
	Whats your message to the players?         
	I have told them that its a new day, a new beginning. Its the spirit which makes the difference. Even if things dont go our way, it wont change our lives. Winning and losing are all part of the game.         
	East Bengals campaign in the I-League hasnt been up to the mark. Any comment?         
	Big deal! We may have lost some matches but the red-and-gold colour is too bright to fade so easily.         
	Your take on Sundays rivals?         
	Bagan are the team to beat. They are in great form and its good for Bengal football that a team from the city is a favourite to win the title. They have been unbeaten in their last 10 matches and have players like (Bhaichung) Bhutia and (Jose Ramirez) Barreto in their ranks. It will be an interesting battle on the morrow.         
	East Bengal have nothing to lose. Does that keep the pressure off you?         
	Nothing to lose? Who says? Our supporters havent tasted a win against our archrivals in the last nine matches. Dont you think we are answerable to them? It is for them that we have to win.         
	But the dream of winning the title win is as good as over         
	I refuse to buy that. In 2004, when I was here, we lost the league even after enjoying a seven-point lead. In football, as in life, nothing is impossible.

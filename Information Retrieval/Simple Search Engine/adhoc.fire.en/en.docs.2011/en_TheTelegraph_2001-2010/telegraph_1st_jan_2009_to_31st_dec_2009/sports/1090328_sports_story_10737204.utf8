	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders cricket manager, John Buchanan, has chosen Bloemfontein as the IPL teams base in the lead-up to the T20 tournaments second edition.         
	Its a quiet city Few will disturb the players and, most important, John has good contacts there Also, the set-up is of a high quality, a well-placed source told The Telegraph.         
	Bloemfontein is, of course, Allan Donald territory. The late Hansie Cronje too hailed from the Free States capital city, once a Whites-only area.         
	The source, who spoke on Friday, added: As of now, we intend taking 24 players, but four will be sent back after our camp and the warm-up matches Eventually, the Knight Riders squad will have 20 players         
	Significantly, no captain/captains will be named when the Knight Riders go public with the list of 24/20.         
	Its a decision taken by Buchanan and, clearly, has the backing of principal owner Shah Rukh Khan.         
	One understands that Buchanan and the first lot of around 10 players could leave as early as March 31, with most of the others joining them by April 4 or so.         
	Those doing international duty would, obviously, be reporting last.         
	Were likely to depart for Cape Town (venue of the opening ceremony and the editions first two matches) on April 16, the source pointed out.         
	The Knight Riders opening match, against the Deccan Chargers, is in Cape Town itself, on April 19 (Day II of the tournament).

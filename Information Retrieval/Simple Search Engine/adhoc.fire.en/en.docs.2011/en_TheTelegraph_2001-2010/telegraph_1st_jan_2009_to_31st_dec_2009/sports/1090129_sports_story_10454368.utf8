The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Simon gives Nadal a fight
                                                     Simon gives Nadal a fight
                  Rafael Nadal in Melbourne on Wednesday                     
	Melbourne: Serena Williams survived the onset of a once-in-a-century heatwave and endured an out-of-body experience on Wednesday to oust Svetlana Kuznetsova and join a trio of Muscovites in the Australian Open semi-finals.         
	Closing the Rod Laver Arena roof and cranking up the air conditioning helped the defending champion pull herself together and advance to the semi-finals  but left her opponent steaming.         
	I felt I was watching someone play in a blue dress, and it wasnt me, because it was so hot out there, said the second-ranked American, who beat Russias Svetlana Kuznetsova 5-7, 7-5, 6-1. And I kept trying to tell myself that its not hot. But it got hotter.         
	Serena, seeking her fourth Australian title and 10th Grand Slam championship overall, next faces Olympic gold medallist Elena Dementieva, who had to play her entire match with the roof open. The fourth-seeded Dementieva ousted Carla Suarez Navarro 6-2, 6-2 to run her winning streak to 15 matches after she won two tune-up tournaments.         
	Top ranked Rafael Nadal won his fifth match without dropping a set by beating Gilles Simon 6-2, 7-5, 7-5, though he was strongly tested by the sixth-seeded Frenchman. Simon broke his serve three times  matching Nadals total for the tournament  and had a set point with the Spaniard serving at 4-5 in the second set. Nadal was up to the task, ripping several winners on the dead run that were never inside the court until they landed and skipped away untouched.         
	Simon won their last meeting in Madrid in October. I was coming to the match with some doubts, Nadal said. But I knew I was playing better here.         
	Simon is one of the quickest players around, but Nadal just ground him down by constantly sending him sprinting from corner to corner. Even with the roof still closed, the lanky Frenchman was pouring out sweat.         
	Nadal got his seventh service break on a forehand that caught the line for a 6-5 edge in the third set, then held at love with Simon sending a forehand long on match point.         
	His victory set up an all-Spanish semi-final, with 14th-seeded Fernando Verdasco  the lowest-ranked player to reach the quarter finals  earlier beating No. 5 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, last years runner-up, 7-6 (2), 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.         
	I think its incredible for us, Nadal said. One will be in the finals, so we have to be happy with that.         
	The heat wave is forecast to continue Thursday. If Serena wins  Dementieva has won their last three meetings, including the Olympic quarter finals  she would play a Russian for the third consecutive match in the final. Third-seeded Dinara Safina is facing fellow Russian Vera Zvonareva in the other semi-final.         
	With temperatures soaring to 43 C (109 F) on a cloudless day  moths were dying within seconds of touching down on the blistering surface and Serena had her rackets restrung during her match because they lost their tension  the retractable roof was closed after Kuznetsova won the first set.         
	The heat was beginning to take a toll on Serena and the eighth-seeded Kuznetsova was angry at the decision. She felt that the break gave Serena time to recover and that playing indoors benefitted the Americans powerful serve.         
	Why should I not be? Kuznetsova said. Game going my way. I was very comfortable playing outside. Its two different games. One you play inside; one you play outside. Serena was tough. Shes playing great. I give her credit. But I dont get this rule.         
	Neither did other players.         
	Even though Dementieva won, she felt the roof should have been closed before her match started. Tournament officials called a news conference to explain the decision-making process, bringing in the official doctor and meteorologist to talk about the Wet Bulb Globe measure that determines when its too hot. We do this to protect the players and to protect their ability to perform optimally, said tournament director Craig Tiley.         
	The roof was closed for the first time during a match under the tournaments evolving heat policy, which was changed after a heat wave two years ago. At that time, matches which started under open skies had to finish that way.

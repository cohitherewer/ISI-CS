                                                     Poulami: Nice to be honoured
            A STAFF REPORTER            Mangal Singh Champia                           
	Calcutta: Poulami Ghatak believes her engagement to fellow table tennis player Soumyadeep Roy, earlier this month, is the good luck charm that has earned her the Arjuna Award.         
	Speaking from Delhi before boarding a China-bound flight on Monday, the 26-year old said: I am very happy. I believe that my engagement has brought me good luck and that is the reason I have been nominated for such a prestigious Award.         
	Poulami, who will participate in a tournament in China, is the sole sportsperson from Bengal to bag the Arjuna Award this year.         
	It feels nice to be honoured. I want to dedicate this success to my parents, my in-laws and my sister, she said.         
	Incidentally, Poulami got engaged to Soumaydeep on July 12. Olympian Mangal Singh Champia, the sole archer on this years list, felt the Award should have come last year itself.         
	I am happy today. But I should have won the Award last year, Mangal told The Telegraph.         
	Mangal had made the Arjuna Awardees shortlist last year too.         
	But this year I was almost sure to win it. I have been performing consistently and bringing medals, the 26-year old said.

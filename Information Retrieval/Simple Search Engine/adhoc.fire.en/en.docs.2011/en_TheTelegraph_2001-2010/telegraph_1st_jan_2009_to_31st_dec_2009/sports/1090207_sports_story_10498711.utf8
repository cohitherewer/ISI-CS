The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pietersen tipped to lead Bangalore
                                                   Pietersen tipped to lead Bangalore
            Richard Hobson                      
	For three weeks only, Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen will be able to look down on the millionaire footballers in England after securing contracts worth about 170,000 per week in the Indian Premier League (IPL) auction. They were not the only winners as the gavel slammed down in Goa.         
	Ravi Boparas $450,000 deal may seem relatively modest, but it means that the Essex player will earn in a month what ordinarily would take him two years.         
	Although England rank among the weaker one-day teams in the world, they can now boast in Flintoff and Pietersen the two most highly valued cricketers in the IPL. Only a minute after Chennai Super Kings paid $1.55 million for Flintoff, Bangalore Royal Challengers matched the record when they secured their own prime target in Pietersen. Shane Warnes Rajasthan Royals were outbid both times.         
	Wages are paid pro rata and Flintoff and Pietersen are available for the first 21 days of the competition. Bopara can play an extra week for Kings XI Punjab under the terms of his ECB incremental contract, which contributes close to a fifth of his core annual salary of roughly 100,000.         
	Essex pay the rest but, regardless of money, it is a dream opportunity for a 23-year-old with roots in northern India and who speaks fluent Punjabi.         
	While some England players have slavishly followed the party line that IPL has not been a leading topic of discussion, Bopara has never been embarrassed to show an interest. Dealers were impressed by his brilliant 201 not out in the Friends Provident Trophy quarter-final against Leicestershire last season and the Punjab franchise had money to spare when Michael Clarke, their first target, pulled out on Wednesday.         
	The fee for Pietersen was expected to beat the record of $1.5million paid by Chennai for Mahendra Singh Dhoni last year. Just in case there was doubt, Vijay Mallya ensured that his signing would become the centre of attention by suggesting that Pietersen, a month after resigning the England captaincy, may lead his new club for the first half of the event, which runs from April 10 to May 29. That option is open, Mallya said.         
	Ray Jennings, as the Bangalore coach, will have a big say in that. Jennings fits part of Pietersens ideal coach straight away, being South African. On the debit side, he makes Peter Moores looks like a mouse and his aggressive methods brought near-revolt from players in a brief stint with the national side.         
	Bangalore finished next to bottom under Rahul Dravid in 2008, when they appeared to make the mistake of thinking that games lasted five days rather than three hours. Jacques Kallis was their star buy.         
	They have clearly learnt because Pietersen was joined Friday by Jesse Ryder, the flamboyant New Zealand opener, who may be interested to know that Mallya is chairman of a brewery group.         
	In all, seven English players will feature. Delhi DareDevils paid $275,000 each for Paul Collingwood and Owais Shah, who was the single touring player to enhance his reputation during the one-day series in India before Christmas. Dimitri Mascarenhas and Graham Napier already had deals in place, but there were no takers for Samit Patel or Luke Wright.         
	More places will become available if the IPL expands to 12 franchises as Lalit Modi, the commissioner, expects to happen before long.         
	Owners have been savvy with one of the biggest outlays of $650,000 by Rajasthan on Tyron Henderson, arguably the leading Twenty20 specialist in the world.           THE TIMES, LONDON

                                                     Zaheer Khan: Trying to regain bowling fitness
                  Zaheer Khan                     
	Bangalore: Out of action for the last four months due to a shoulder injury, Zaheer Khan is hopeful of returning to the national side. The Team India pacer is going though regular fitness drills to regain fitness.         
	Zaheer, who underwent an arthroscopic labral repair on his left shoulder in South Africa in mid-July and has subsequently gone through a rehabilitation programme, said he was currently working on his fitness.         
	I have been bowling for a while and have been regularly practising for the last two weeks. I am trying to regain my bowling fitness., the bowler said.         
	I miss playing cricket, and that is for sure that I want to get back to playing cricket, said the 30-year-old, who missed both the ICC World Twenty20 in England and Champions Trophy in South Africa. On the upcoming India-Australia ODI series, he felt that Mahendra Singh Dhonis team would do well.         
	On the Australian team, Zaheer said: They talk more about the team they are playing against than their own. It is time they look at what their own team is doing and stop worrying about others.

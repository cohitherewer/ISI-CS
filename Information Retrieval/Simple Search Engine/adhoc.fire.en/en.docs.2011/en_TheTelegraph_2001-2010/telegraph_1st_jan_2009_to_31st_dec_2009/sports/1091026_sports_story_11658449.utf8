The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bout of migraine keeps Mark Benson away
                                                     Bout of migraine keeps Mark Benson away
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mark Benson                           
	Vadodara: A severe bout of migraine forced Mark Benson to miss officiating in the opening ODI of the latest India-Australia series.         
	The attack came last night and the migraine usually remains for a day, with a hangover effect generally persisting for 24 hours after that, Benson told The Telegraph on Sunday evening.         
	Speaking at The Gateway Hotel, the 51-year-old former England cricketer (his only Test was against India, in 1986) added: Ive been experiencing such attacks two or three times in a year... Unless I dont feel better at all, Ill definitely travel to Nagpur on Monday...         
	Benson is scheduled to officiate in the first four ODIs, with the second slotted for Wednesday. His illness here saw Amiesh Saheba being promoted to on-field duty (with comeback man S.K. Tarapore).         
	Incidentally, Benson had also taken ill during the South Africa-India Test in Durban, almost three years ago. Hed been rushed to hospital from Kingsmead and, soon afterwards, underwent heart surgery.         
	Oh, it was different (and more serious) then, palpitations starting that illness... Id then felt as if Id suffered a heart attack, Benson recalled.         
	Benson, whose place on the field in Durban was taken by Ian Howell, has been on the ICCs Elite Panel for some years now. Pakistans Asad Rauf had been at the other end there.

	Calcutta: India B women sprung back into the championship by upsetting India A in the 4th round of the Asian Team Chess Championship at Town Hall on Friday.         
	The mens India A team continued their string of victories  though their first board GM P. Harikrishna was surprised by Le Quam Liem  to maintain their lead by a point.         
	India A now have eight points and are followed by Iran a point behind. They meet in a crucial fifth round Saturday, and the result might decide the fate of the championship.         
	In the womens section, after India As unexpected reversal, Vietnam emerged as sole leader with seven points. They beat Iran by a narrow margin of 2.5-1.5 points.         
	India captain GM K. Sasikiran won against Nguyen Ngoe Troung Son, while Surya Sekhar Ganguly won a quick game against GM Dao Thien Hai with the black pieces in a Grunfeld defence.         
	GM Parimarjan Negi drew his game against GM Nguyen Anh Dung.         
	The day, however, belonged to the national junior girls champion, 17-year-old Bhakti Kulkarni, who outwitted WGM Kruttika Nadig on the fourth board, to set up her teams victory against their star-studded A team.         
	It was the best game of my life, particularly so, because it helped my team win, said Bhakti, a Class XII student.         
	City-based WGM Mary Ann Gomes played the end-game brilliantly to hold former world junior champion WGM Dranavalli Harika on the top board, while WGM Nisha Mohota drew against WGM Eesha Karwade on the second.         
	Young Padmini Rout held WGM Tania Sachdev to a creditable draw.         
	We came back from the grave a beaming captain Nisha Mohota said after the game.         
	I had full faith in Bhakti and had asked her to get the full point Friday morning during breakfast she added.         
	Mary Ann, a devout Catholic, said it was the best Christmas gift for her.         
	A decade ago, I drew against Harika, also on Christmas, to win the National U-9 title, she said.

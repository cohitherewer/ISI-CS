	San Francisco: Phil Mickelson and Anthony Kim led the way as Presidents Cup holders, the US, fended off a bright start by the Internationals to lead by 3 points to 2 after Thursdays opening foursomes.         
	At one point, the Americans trailed in four of the six alternate-shot encounters before gathering momentum over the closing stretch at Harding Park Golf Course.         
	The Internationals have generally struggled in the foursomes playing format and the home team, seeking their sixth victory in the Cups eighth edition, ended the day in control.         
	However, a two-point advantage appeared likely for the US until Jim Furyk and Justin Leonard lost the final two holes of their match against South African Retief Goosen and South Korean Yang Yong-eun to finish all square.         
	Mickelson and rookie Kim, one down to Canadian Mike Weir and South African Tim Clark after 12 holes in the top match, rallied in spectacular fashion with four successive birdies to draw first blood with a 3 amp;2 win.         
	A superb wedge approach by Kim to three feet at the par-four 13th sparked the late surge by the Americans in mainly overcast and cool conditions at Harding Park.         
	The American duo charged three up with four birdies in the first six holes and never relinquished their grip before sealing victory at the par-three 14th where Woods rolled in a 15-footer for birdie.

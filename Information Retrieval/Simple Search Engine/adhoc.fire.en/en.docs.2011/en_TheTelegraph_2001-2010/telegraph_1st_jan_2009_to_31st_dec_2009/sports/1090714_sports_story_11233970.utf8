	Kingstown: Fast bowler Darren Sammy set up an intriguing victory chase of 277 off 80 overs for the West Indies on Monday after finishing his stint with five for 70 on the final day of the opening Test against Bangladesh.               
	At tea, the West Indies were 128 for six. Nikita Miller (3) and David Bernard (18) were at the crease               
	Bangladesh, overnight 321 for five, were toppled for 345 in their second innings, losing five wickets in the first hour at Arnos Vale.         
	The West Indies lost both the openers as they went to lunch at 66 for two, still needing 211 from a further 62 overs.         
	Captain Floyd Reifer was unbeaten on 18 while Travis Dowlin was 17 not out.         
	Left-arm spinner Shakib-al Hasan, stand-in captain in place of the injured Mashrafe Mortaza, took one for 11 while the other wicket fell courtesy a run out.         
	Earlier, the visitors lost their way to Sammy and Kemar Roachs controlled pace bowling.         
	Shakib hit an early boundary but fell soon afterwards as he lofted an expansive stroke to mid-off off Sammy. The left-hander hit two fours in 30.         
	Mahmudullah (8) followed soon afterwards, leg before to a good length delivery from Roach. The innings swiftly subsided as Mortaza, handicapped by his knee injury, fell for a duck as he clipped a catch to square leg off Sammy.         
	Roach spreadeagled the stumps of Mushfiqur Rahim and Sammy claimed his second five-wicket haul in Tests by gaining a fortunate leg before decision against last man Rubel Hossain (1).         
	Mushfiqur struck three boundaries in 37 off 97 balls.         
	Openers Dale Richards and Omar Phillips launched the West Indies pursuit in thrilling style before both fell in quick succession.         
	Richards lashed three delightful boundaries in 14 before he was run out. (AP)

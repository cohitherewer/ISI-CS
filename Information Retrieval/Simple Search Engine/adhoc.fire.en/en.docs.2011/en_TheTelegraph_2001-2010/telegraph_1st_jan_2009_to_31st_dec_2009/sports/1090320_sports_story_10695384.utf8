	London: Paul Collingwood and Owais Shah have asked Delhi Daredevils, their IPL team, and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) if Ahmedabad is safe enough to play.         
	The city has been proposed as a venue in the revised IPL schedule which is awaiting Indias home ministrys nod.         
	According to a British daily, Collingwood and Shah are in two minds about playing in the city. Lines of communication are open and we have been seeking to make a contribution on all aspects of security, Sean Morris, chief executive of the Professional Cricketers Association, was quoted as saying. It is true England had no wish to play in Ahmedabad after the Mumbai bombings, he said.

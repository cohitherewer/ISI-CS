                                                   West Indies make it 1-1
                      
	Georgetown: An unbeaten 112 by Shivnarine Chanderpaul trumped a fine 105 from Andrew Strauss as the West Indies beat England by 21 runs in the second one-day International at the National Stadium at Providence.         
	Chanderpauls 10th ODI century, spiced with 10 fours off 134 balls, was the backbone of the home teams challenging 264-8 off 50 overs on Sunday, which proved enough to level the five-match series 1-1.         
	Fellow Guyanese Ramnaresh Sarwan chipped in with 74 off 89 deliveries. James Anderson (3-37) led Englands attack while medium pacers Paul Collingwood (3-49) and Dimitri Mascarenhas (2-53) provided fine support.         
	Strauss anchored Englands chase but the visitors were bowled out for 243 off 48.2 overs. The 32-year-old Strauss cracked seven fours off 129 balls in his third one-day hundred before he was ninth out.         
	The medium pacers Dwayne Bravo (2-40), Kieron Pollard (2-46) and Darren Sammy (1-36 in 10 overs) starred for the home team.         
	Strauss admitted that England were let down by early strikes from the West Indies. We lost too many wickets too early so we were always a little bit behind the eight ball, he said.         
	The West Indies were in early peril after they won the toss and batted. The 26-year-old Anderson removed both openers as the home team limped to 24-2.           (AP)

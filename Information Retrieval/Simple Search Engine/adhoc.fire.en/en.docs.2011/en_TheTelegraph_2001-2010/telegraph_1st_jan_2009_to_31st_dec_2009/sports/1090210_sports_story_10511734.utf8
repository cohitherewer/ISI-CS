	Chennai: Ramesh Powar wrecked South Zone with a 10-wicket haul in the match as West Zone lifted their 17th Duleep Trophy title on Monday defeating the hosts by 274 runs in the five-day final here.         
	Chasing an improbable 678 for victory, South Zone ended at 403 for nine in their second innings. Injured Vinay Kumar did not come out to bat.         
	Off-spinner Powar took seven for 140 in the second innings with a match haul of 10 for 187.         
	Resuming at the overnight score of 232 for three, skipper S. Badrinath (59) and wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik (75) toiled hard for runs. The duo put on 121 runs for the fourth wicket before Badrinath was caught at long on by Powar off the bowling of Rajesh Pawar.         
	Badrinath, a centurion in the first innings, stroked eight fours during his fighting knock in the second essay. Karthik was unfortunate to be dismissed hit wicket off Powar.         
	He shouldered arms to Powar but while watching the ball through to the keeper, dragged his right leg back and trod on the stumps. Karthik hit five fours and three sixes during his stay at the crease.         
	R. Ashwin played a valiant unbeaten innings of 46  studded with eight fours  and combined with M. Suresh (28) for a half-century stand. Shadab Jakati contributed 22 runs.         
	Powar scalped five of the six wickets that fell on Monday on a crumbling pitch. For West Zones Wasim Jaffer, the triumph rounded off a brilliant season as he had led Mumbai to the Ranji Trophy title earlier.         
	South needed another 446 to win on the final. On a crumbling pitch, their biggest challenge was facing the spin duo of Powar and Rajesh Pawar and not surprisingly, the pair bowled 64 per cent of the overs.         
	West already had a firm grip on the trophy by virtue of their first-innings lead; it was only a matter of whether South would hang on for a draw. West took three wickets in the opening session and importantly, claimed all the specialist batsmen.         
	Once Badrinath fell, West attacked the new batsman, Arjun Yadav, who didnt last very long. Powar kept plugging away outside the off stump and his patience finally paid off when Yadav lobbed a catch to Pawar at mid-off.         
	R Ashwin and M Suresh took the attack to the seamers and resisted with a half-century stand. They didnt last too long in the afternoon session as Suresh lost his off stump while trying to cut Powar.         
	Shadab Jakati added 22 with Ashwin before he was trapped lbw by a Powar delivery which straightened. That signalled the end and none of the remaining batsmen managed to arrest the slide.         
	The 58-run stand for the seventh wicket in 22.1 overs between Ashwin, who remained unbeaten on 46 and Suresh only delayed the inevitable.         
	Getting prodigious turn, Powar made the South batsmen dance to his tune and signed off in style removing S Jakati (4) and Sreesanth (4) in one over, triggering celebrations in the West camp.

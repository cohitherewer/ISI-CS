The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Azad remark raises a storm
                                                     Azad remark raises a storm
  - DDCA row 
  -   Pataudi brokers peace between cricketers and the association               Sehwag                           
	New Delhi: No sooner had Arun Jaitley resolved the Delhi Ranji players dispute than he turned on fellow Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member Kirti Azad who has claimed that prostitutes were used to influence the Delhi Ranji sides team composition.         
	The allegation has drawn a strong reaction from the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) president who has demanded Azad back his charge with proof.         
	Azads claim means further embarrassment for the DDCA and Jaitley was in no mood to take it lying down.         
	He owes a national responsibility to give us the full details, an agitated Jaitley said Tuesday.         
	If he gives us the details, we will investigate the matter and will take the strictest action if it is proved true, he said.         
	But if he fails to give us the facts, it would be his own credibility that would be in danger, Jaitley said of Azad, who is also a BJP Parliamentarian.         
	Jaitley said Azad this was a serious charge and that Azad would have to back it up with evidence.         
	This is a serious allegation and he just cannot pass the buck by saying he heard it or read it somewhere, Jaitley said.         
	As for the mutiny led by Virender Sehwag, it fizzled out on Tuesday with a tame compromise after former India captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi brokered peace between the DDCA and the players.         
	Jaitley said the compromise was reached Monday evening when Sehwag and Delhi teammate Gautam Gambhir met him in Pataudis presence.         
	Accordingly, Sehwag is not going anywhere and would be representing Delhi, Jaitley said, without disclosing how he managed to pacify the star opener who had threatened to leave Delhi protesting nepotism and the high-handedness of the sports committee.         
	Last (Monday) evening, both the senior players met me and my DDCA colleagues and we were fortunate to have Mr Pataudi among us. We discussed several issues and I can tell you that the nature of the discussion was not adversarial, Jaitley said.         
	They had primarily two concerns  to ensure that the selection process is absolutely fair and that no interference of any kind is tolerated. Their suggestions were well-intentioned and I told the players and my colleagues that both steps should be taken so that fairness is maintained, he said.         
	Jaitley said he had never feared that the issue would snowball into a crisis and said it had been an opportunity to set things right.         
	I did not see it developing into a crisis. It was not a conflict of interest. Their and our objectives are the same. I rather saw it as an opportunity for bringing reforms, he said.         
	Even though some DDCA officials had been quoted in the media as saying that Sehwag was free to collect his No Objection Certificate and move to Haryana, Jaitley completely denied any such statements.         
	Nobody ever said Sehwag can go if he wanted. The moment I came to know about his view on the subject, I told him to meet me... He did just that and we resolved the issue, Jaitley said.         
	In the entire exercise, not a single sports committee head rolled as Jaitley sprang to the support of the panel, which has been at the eye of the storm.         
	In what seemed the only consolation for Sehwag, Jaitley said the DDCA was ready to form a panel comprising senior players.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Physio report puts BCCI in a tight spot
                                                   Physio report puts BCCI in a tight spot
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) was left grappling on Friday with a fresh controversy when it came to light that some key players, including captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, were selected in the World Twenty20 squad despite carrying injuries.         
	Team physio Nitin Patel had cast doubts on the fitness of as many as five key players in his report to the BCCI before the tournament, but all of them were included.         
	According to reports, the physios report had mentioned that Dhoni, Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, RP Singh and Zaheer Khan had injuries that needed treatment. The BCCI sought to downplay the physios report saying it was a routine report, and that the injuries sustained by the players were really too minor in nature to warrant an omission from the side.         
	It is a routine report which is given before every tour to assess the fitness of the players. Too much importance should not be attached to the report, BCCIs media and finance committee chairman Rajiv Shukla said.         
	Interestingly, Dhoni himself had disclosed that many of his players were not 100 per cent fit.         
	We werent 100 per cent there on the field. Somebody had an ankle problem, somebody had a shoulder problem That impacted on our fielding Its coming to be more demanding mentally and players will, I think, have to take breaks to be at peak fitness, Dhoni said.         
	Team India coach Gary Kirsten had earlier said: Its not an excuse, but fatigue was a factor Also, we had a fair number of players not in the best of form and some were carrying niggles from the IPL.

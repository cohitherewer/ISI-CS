                                                   Ravi Shastri: I didnt have to be told what to do after play
  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  Flamboyant ex-captain says a professional should know what rsquo;s good for him
                  LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                                                        
	Johannesburg: Former India captain Ravi Shastri, a man of many parts who today is with the International Cricket Council as well, spoke to The Telegraph on Sunday afternoon.         
	Known to talk straight, he did just that         
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Youve served as a stand-in cricket manager/coach of the Indian team. Would you have communicated with the players in writing on, among other things, sex and its link with on-field performances?         
	A Look, (present coach) Gary Kirsten has denied any role in circulating a document...         
	He has. However, would you have put something which isnt openly discussed in India, in writing, as has been done by mental conditioning expert Paddy Upton?         
	When I was playing, I didnt even think about it... It happened... I didnt need anybody to tell me either what to do or what not to do after a days play... It was my business and I knew exactly what to do.         
	But you havent answered the question...         
	Each one has his own way of saying and doing things... I wouldnt need to put anything down on paper, Id just go to the player and tell him what needed to be told... Whats said in the dressing room must, in my view, not go beyond its walls. I dont see why such an issue has been made.         
	You had a playboy image, didnt you?         
	(Interrupting) Who is a playboy?         
	Certainly one with women hanging from his arms...         
	Thank God that they were women, not men!         
	Youve said it happened. From your experience, then, is there actually a connection between sex and delivering on the field?         
	Thats a very personal question. Why dont you see my record? Youll get the answer in those facts and figures... I did what I did.         
	Do cricketers need to be wary of certain off-field distractions?         
	A professional should know whats good for him and what could be a distraction. He doesnt need to be told.         
	The final one: Your thoughts on the studies to establish a link between sex and on-field performances...         
	(Amused) Why get into studies and research? Where Im concerned, a good player will remain a good player... Such studies could continue for the next 20 years or so... Let me know if anything conclusive is reached.

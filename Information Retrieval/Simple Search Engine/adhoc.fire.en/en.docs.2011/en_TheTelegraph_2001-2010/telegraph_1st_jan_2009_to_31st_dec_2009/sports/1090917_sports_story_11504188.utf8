	London: Two goals from the worlds most expensive player helped Real Madrid beat FC Zurich 5-2 to begin a Champions League journey they trust will take them across Europe and all the way back home.         
	Cristiano Ronaldo struck the first for Real, who will host this seasons final, and the $133.2 million new boy helped them recover from a nasty bout of nerves by adding a second free kick late in the Group C opener on Tuesday.         
	The tussle at the Letzigrund provided the best entertainment on the return of European footballs elite club competition.         
	Manchester United, who lost to Barcelona in last seasons final, squeezed a 1-0 win at Besiktas in Group B with a Paul Scholes header and Juventus were held 1-1 at home by Bordeaux in Group A.         
	A goal from striker Nicolas Anelka, beautifully taken after his first effort was beaten away, gave Chelsea a 1-0 home win over Porto in Group D while two goals from Filippo Inzaghi kept AC Milan on Reals heels with a 2-1 win at Olympique Marseille.         
	Milans game at Marseille was a repeat of the first final of the Champions League era in 1993 but this was not to be a night of classic drama  apart from in Zurich, that is.         
	Real brought in Ronaldo from Manchester United as part of an eye-watering investment of a quarter of a $365.9 million designed to buy them a ticket for their own end-of-season party at the Bernabeu.         
	Qualifying for the knockout phase should be a formality after this victory but the way they let the Swiss team give them a scare will give coach Manuel Pellegrini a lot to think about.         
	They say were favourites to win the Champions League but we have to take it step by step, Ronaldo told reporters after his two-goal European debut for the Spanish club.         
	I never feel pressure, the 24-year-old added. I just work to score goals. I scored two and Im really pleased for that but the important thing is to win games.         
	Real, who won the last of their nine European Cups in 2002, appeared to be cruising when Ronaldo, Raul and Gonzalo Higuain scored in a devastating 18-minute spell before halftime but from 3-0 up they suddenly found themselves wobbling at 3-2.         
	The game turned when Xavier Margairaz converted a 64th-minute penalty after Iker Casillas upended Alexandre Alphonse and almost immediately Silvan Aegerter headed in to bring the game back to life.         
	Ronaldo snuffed out Zurichs comeback hopes with a free kick from longer range with a minute of normal time left, as keeper Johnny Leoni contrived to punch the ball into the roof of his own net. Guti then completed the scoring.         
	Bayern Munich took control in Group A with a 3-0 win at Maccabi Haifa, with Thomas Mueller scoring two goals.         
	VfL Wolfsburg had a Grafite hattrick to thank for a 3-1 home win over CSKA Moscow in Group B.         
	APOEL Nicosia had an encouraging goalless draw at Atletico Madrid in Group D. (AP)

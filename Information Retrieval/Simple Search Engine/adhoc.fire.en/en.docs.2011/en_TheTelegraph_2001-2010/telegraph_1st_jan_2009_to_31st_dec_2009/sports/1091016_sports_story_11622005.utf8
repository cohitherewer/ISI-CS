The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Marcus returns home, again
                                                     Marcus returns home, again
            Nick Hoult            Marcus Trescothick                           
	Marcus Trescothick was warned only a week ago that his stress-related illness could return at any time. On Thursday, it struck again and he flew home just hours after learning Somerset faced at least another four days in India.         
	While his team-mates made the short 45 minute flight from Bangalore to Hyderabad on Thursday morning to begin their Champions League T20 Super Eight phase on Friday, Trescothick was on a plane destined for Heathrow.         
	He had asked for a meeting with Brian Rose, the Somerset director of cricket, after his sides defeat by Trinidad amp; Tobago in Bangalore. He had been dismissed in that match for three but had looked relaxed throughout, chatting to the television studio as Somersets fielder nominated to wear a microphone.         
	However, underneath it was different and he was experiencing the separation anxiety that triggers his problems. Rose knew what was afoot. It was over. But Trescothick stayed on for a couple more days and if Somerset had exited the tournament on Wednesday evening, courtesy of Deccan Chargers beating Trinidad, then he would have flown home on Thursday with his team-mates and his plight would have been covered up.         
	But Deccan lost in a final-ball thriller putting Somerset into the second phase and matches in Hyderabad on Friday against Diamond Eagles and New South Wales on Sunday. While his team-mates celebrated their amazing escape, Trescothick knew he would not be with them to share the rest of their Champions League experience.         
	As you are all well aware Marcus Trescothick has made a great effort to travel to India to attend this exciting tournament, said Rose, who had accompanied Trescothick on his flight to India. Regrettably it has not worked out for him regarding his personal well being and he has travelled back to England to rejoin his family. The club and his team-mates fully appreciated this effort and personal commitment and look forward to further success on his behalf.         
	Officials at Somerset were insisting all was well in the camp only hours before the club released a statement on Thursday night.         
	But by then Trescothick was almost back in England and gone with him were any faint hopes of this being the start of a new era for a batsman England would desperately like to have fit.         
	Last week Trescothick met the press in India only 24 hours after arriving for his first cricket trip abroad since his England career collapsed on the last Ashes tour in 2006-07.         
	In Hyderabad where his team was staying, Trescothick was open and honest admitting he only made the decision to fly to India the day before arrival. The club had agreed his wife, Hayley, could accompany him and that he could join the team a few days after the rest of the squad had arrived in India.         
	He said at the time: In my own mind it is just an achievement to get here but Ive still got to continue to work and do the good things Im doing to maintain me being here.         
	He was wrong and once again a trip to India was too much. It was in a hotel room in Baroda in 2006, Trescothick suffered nights of mental anxiety and left an England tour for the first time. In Pakistan in 2005, where his problems first surfaced on international duty, he remained with his team-mates and saw a miserable tour through.         
	Trescothick is home again. It is hard to see him ever leaving again.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

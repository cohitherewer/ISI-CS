The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indian could replace John
                                                     Indian could replace John
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Shah Rukh Khan                           
	Calcutta: Its not official (and may not be for some time yet), but its almost certain that (a) John Buchanan will be replaced as the Kolkata Knight Riders head of cricket operations and (b) the support staff will feature more Indians.         
	From No.6 in the IPLs inaugural meet, last year, the franchise finished at the bottom (No.8) in the just-ended second edition.         
	(Principal owner) Shah Rukh Khan could have asked Buchanan to break journey in Mumbai on the way home (Brisbane) from South Africa, but chose not to. That, as far as Im concerned, is bad news for Buchanan. I dont see him continuing, somebody associated with the Knights told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Saturday afternoon, more than a week after the Knights eminently forgettable campaign got over, the gentleman added: Also on the cards is a stronger Indian presence where the support staff is concerned Its likely that the next head of cricket operations would be somebody who has represented India at the international level...         
	However, it doesnt necessarily mean that the coach (currently Buchanan chela Matthew Mott) too would be an Indian.         
	At present, among the support staff, team director Joy Bhattacharjya is the highest-ranked Indian.         
	Buchanans contract probably runs till 2010, or the end of the third edition, but there would surely be a termination/exit clause.         
	For good reasons, the franchise wouldnt like another mess, like the one it invited by the poorly-executed (and absolutely needless) sacking of Sourav Ganguly as captain, just days before the meet in South Africa.         
	Shah Rukh, it seems, has been advised not to rush things as time isnt at a premium and (learning from experience) just about everything would have to be handled in a sensitive manner.         
	Talking of Sourav, according to the gentleman, there may actually be a big role for him between now and the start of the next edition.         
	I say so because 2010 will be Souravs last year as a cricketer in any form and hed be keen to sign off a winner rather than a loser... To be honest, I dont know Shah Rukhs mind on this, but theres definitely a feeling (within) that Sourav should be made to get involved in a much bigger way... We need to use his experience, perhaps even as a suitably designated talent-spotter in the lead-up to next year...         
	That call will, of course, be made by Shah Rukh.         
	Other key decisions will also be taken by the principal owner, but all after the middle of July, when hes back in India after six weeks of shooting overseas.         
	Shah Rukh is set to go abroad on Tuesday.         
	Incidentally, while Souravs successor Brendon McCullum (hand-picked by Buchanan) scores on quite a few fronts, he isnt exactly hot tactically.         
	The captaincy issue, therefore, appears to be pretty open.         
	Come to think of it, Shah Rukh has much on his plate before the IPLs next edition.

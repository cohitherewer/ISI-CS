	Calcutta: It was double delight for Krittwika Sinha Roy on Wednesday. The 16-year old clinched the youth girls and womens title at the Toss West Bengal State Table Tennis Championship at Narikeldanga Sadharan Samity.         
	I feel great, a beaming Krittwika said after outsmarting Kajol Das 9-11, 11-6, 7-11, 11-6, 9-11, 11-7, 11-3 in the womens title clash.         
	Incidentally, Kajol lost to Krittwika in the youth girls final earlier. 11-6, 5-11, 12-14, 9-11, 11-5, 6-11 was how the scoreboard read after that encounter.         
	However, Krittwika failed to make it a hattrick of titles after she lost in the junior girls final to Sutirtha Mukherjee 3-11, 4-11, 4-11, 7-11.         
	I am always nervous while playing finals... Even today (Wednesday) I was nervous and that is why I lost the junior girls final. I feel todays performance will help me in the upcoming zonal tournaments from October, added Bengal womens No.1.         
	Playing since she was two years old, along with brother Anirban Sinha Roy, who however lost in a second round match on Wednesday, Krittwika is focused on joining the likes of Poulami Ghatak and Mauma Das.         
	I have always dreamt of making it big, like Mouma and Poulami I know it wont be easy but I am confident, she said.         
	My strength is spin. I have always relied on that. But I lack power. I know if I want to achieve my dream I have to work on that, the diminutive girl said while talking about her future plans.

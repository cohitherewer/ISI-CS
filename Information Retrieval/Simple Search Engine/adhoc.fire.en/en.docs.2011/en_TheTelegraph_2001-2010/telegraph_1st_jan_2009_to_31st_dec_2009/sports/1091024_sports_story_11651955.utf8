	Trainer Pesi Shroffs three-year-old classic filly, Astral Flash, justified her up-country form while winning the 1,400m Goffs Crystal Trophy, the main attraction at the Pune races on Friday, the penultimate day of the 28-day season. Jockey Suraj Narredu, who partnered the Belong To Me-Burooq daughter to a six-length victory, was brilliant in the saddle when he guided a less-fancied Kite Runner to victory in the very next race.RESULTS

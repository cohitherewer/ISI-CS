The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dinda set to be nailed in report
                                                   Dinda set to be nailed in report
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal pacer Ashok Dinda is likely to be nailed in the managers report for his spat with strike partner Ranadeb Bose on the eve of Bengals semi-final against Baroda in the Vijay Hazare Trophy in Agartala.         
	According to sources, Dinda will be held responsible for instigating Bose.         
	The role of the Kolkata Knight Riders pacer is increasingly coming under the scanner with a section in the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) insisting that it was time to put an end to his antics.         
	Incidentally, Dinda was also cautioned by the association for gesturing towards the selectors during a match in the zonal one-dayers for the Vijay Hazare Trophy.         
	The right-arm pacer, however, has his sympathisers in the CAB. It was learnt that a senior member of the Bengal team has already started sending feelers to CAB officials that Dinda should be pardoned for one last time. The issue was also discussed at a meeting at the CAB last week. The office bearers agreed that the spat played a role in Bengals poor show in the Vijay Hazare Trophy final against Tamil Nadu.         
	On submission, the report will be placed before CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya to decide on further course of action.         
	Overall, the issue is far from over and the managers report will play a big role in deciding Dindas fate.

                                                     Double gold for Jayanta
            A STAFF REPORTER            Jayanta Talukdar                           
	Calcutta: Jayanta Talukdar won the individual recurve gold, out-shooting Athens Olympic gold medallist Marco Galiazzo of Italy by 110 points to 108 in the Archery World Cup Stage II being held at Porec in Croatia on Saturday.         
	This is Talukdars second individual gold at the event; the first came in 2006 defeating the same opponent.         
	It was a successful day for the 2006 Arjuna awardee as the mens recurve team, comprising Rahul Banerjee, Mangal Singh Champia and Talukdar, defeated the Russian Federation 220 points to 218.         
	In the individual event, Talukdar held the lead in the first two ends of three arrows each at 55-52.         
	He conceded two points in the third end to allow the Italian to narrow the gap to 81-82. When Galiazzo hit an eight with his second arrow of the final end of the three arrows, the Indian needed a nine to win. Instead he hit a 10 to win his second crown in Porec.         
	This is the third time Talukdar beat the 1996 Olympic gold medallist. Surprisingly, all three times at Porec. As mentioned earlier, he had first tamed Galiazzo in 2006, then in 2008 and for the third time in the final on Saturday.         
	In the team final, the Russian Federation trailed India by one point in the first end, but recovered in the second end to tie the match at 108 points. India took the lead in the third end with 164-162.         
	Their opponents showed their best in the last end, but it was not enough to beat the Indians. The bronze in the mens event went to Italy who beat China 221-219.         
	It was the second team gold for India on the trot, as the trio had earlier won in the same event at the Santo Domingo World Cup Stage I last month, beating Great Britain in the final.         
	The trio had earned India their first team gold in the World Cup series, winning at Antalya in Turkey in 2008. The three, along with Raju Ajonda, had won the gold in the 15th Asian Archery Championship held at Xian, China in 2007.         
	The womens recurve team, however, failed to clinch the bronze, losing the playoff to Ukraine at 197-212.         
	Though, the women took the lead in the first end with 53 points against 49 points by their opponents, they could not manage against the windy conditions.         
	China took the gold beating France 214-200.

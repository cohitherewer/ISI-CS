The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SA board seeks report on exit
                                                   SA board seeks report on exit
                      
	Johannesburg: South Africas persistent failure to deliver at big events, highlighted most recently by their early exit from the Champions Trophy, has prompted Cricket South Africa (CSA) to demand a report on where the team has been going wrong, from coach Mickey Arthur.         
	This followed an unprecedented public outrage over the teams failure to qualify for the Champions Trophy being played here.         
	There will be a brutally honest analysis of the Proteas early demise in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy and other failures of this nature in knockout competitions, to ensure that it does not happen again, said a joint statement by CSA CEO Gerald Majola and Arthur.         
	If mistakes have been made, they must be acknowledged and remedied before the next World Cup, it added.         
	The statement said, while credit must go to the Proteas for being ranked as the worlds top Test and ODI team, this should not overshadow the need to bridge the gap between these ratings and the failure of the Proteas to reach the semi-finals of the ICC Champions Trophy on home soil, as well as other major knockout tournaments elsewhere.         
	The analysis and the remedial process is to begin immediately and a report on the way forward will be presented to the board of directors of Cricket South Africa by the national coach at its next board meeting on October 30, it added.         
	Meanwhile, national selector Mike Procter feels too many all-rounders and lack of specialists in the team is the reason for South Africas debacle.         
	Its probably necessary that we go back to a team that almost looks like a Test team, with six specialist batsmen, four bowlers and a wicket-keeper, Procter told a local daily.         
	Procter said the side lacked a specialist bowler against England Sunday. Another batsman in the middle order, who could have kept us on course when a few wickets fell suddenly, would also have helped, he pointed out.         
	Mark Boucher can get you 30s and 40s at No.6 in the batting order, but we needed another specialist batsman in that position, he said.         
	Procter felt that a big hitter such as Albie Morkel or Roelof van der Merwe should have been at No.3 against Sri Lanka and England, but captain Graeme Smith disagreed.         
	In Jacques Kallis and AB de Villiers, you have two world-class batsmen who went in at No.3 and 4. They had all the hits to take advantage of such a situation and thats why I dont think a big hitter could have done any better, Smith said.

	Mumbai/ Vadodara: On a day dominated by the bowlers and marked by tumbling of 20 wickets, Saurashtra eked out a wafer-thin four-run first innings lead over Baroda on the first day of their Ranji Trophy Super League Group B match here Tuesday.         
	Saurashtra were bundled out for a paltry 127 as Munaf Patel Baroda captain Irfan Pathan wrecked havoc. Munaf grabbed five for 48 while Irfan chipped in with three for 41.         
	But Barodas reply turned out to be even weaker and the hosts were shot out for 123 runs in 40.5 overs with Jayesh Odedra grabbing five for 28.         
	In Mumbai, S. Badrinath hit a century to help Tamil Nadu avoid a disaster against Mumbai at the BKC ground here on Tuesday. Badrinath scored an unbeaten 123 to lead Tamil Nadus recovery from 51 for five and reach 251 for five at close on the opening day. Badrinath was well supported by C. Ganapathi (70n..) as the duo stitched an unbroken 200-run partnership.

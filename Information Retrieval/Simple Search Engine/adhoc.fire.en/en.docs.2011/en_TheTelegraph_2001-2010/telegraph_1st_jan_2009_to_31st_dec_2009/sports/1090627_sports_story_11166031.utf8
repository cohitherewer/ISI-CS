The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No balls put off coach Nielsen
                                                   No balls put off coach Nielsen
                      
	Melbourne: Australia coach Tim Nielsen, furious at the no ball woes of his bowlers, specially of pace spearhead Brett Lee, has said on Friday that he is pulling his hair with the Ashes less than a fortnight away.         
	Nielsen was shocked that the Aussies overstepped the mark 22 times in 80 overs during the four-day match against Sussex county in Hove.         
	Lee was found overstepping eight times, Peter Siddle and Ben Hilfenhaus on five occasions each and off-spinner Nathan Hauritz crossed the line three times.         
	Shocking Pulling my hair out about that. Its the only thing I am a bit grumpy about, Nielsen said.         
	I think we bowled about 18 or 19 of them, so I dont know We dont bowl them in Twenty20 cricket maybe because it is a free hit and so the implications are greater for a no ball in that format, he said.         
	Nielsen hinted that it could be a decisive factor for selection of bowlers in the playing eleven for the first Ashes Test starting July 8 in Cardiff.         
	You would hope not, but yes. The thing is, it seems to me that wherever we play, the length between the popping crease and the stumps is the same. It is something we have to fix up, he said.         
	The coach said the County Ground in Hove had a significant slope, which could be a factor in the bowlers erring.         
	I think the fact you were either running up or down a hill created a lot of problem for them, he said.

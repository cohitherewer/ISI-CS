The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB plans change of Eden lights
                                                                                                                       7                                      CAB plans change of Eden lights
            A STAFF REPORTER                                
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) are planning to have high power bulbs in each of the four towers for future day/night matches.         
	Currently each of the four towers have 216 bulbs. The CAB authorities want to have 125 high power bulbs in each of the four towers.         
	The reason for having lesser number of bulbs is that we would then require much lower power generators (250 kw) for each tower. If we carry on with the current set-up we may require high power generators (750kw), a senior CAB official said on Monday. Accordingly the association will soon be inviting bids from various electrical manufacturers.         
	On Monday, Calcutta Police, PWD and CESC officials, who are part of the seven-man committee formed to probe the light fiasco, inspected the tower at the High Court End. CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey was also present.         
	We will only know what kind of corrective measures can be taken after the committee submits its report, Dey said.         
	The main issue now is the use of the generators during the next phase of matches. While there is a section of influential officials, who strongly feel that during next years IPL, CAB should use the generator and keep CESC on the standby.         
	But there are a few who have a counter-argument. The cost of either buying generators, which is a bigger possibility, or taking them on hire involves a huge cost. Save a month, during IPL every year, apart from four World Cup matches in 2011, there will be hardly any usage round the year. The maintenance cost will be very high in case CAB plans to buy generators and it may turn out to be a White Elephant in future, a senior official said.         
	Also, it remains to be seen whether the CABs working committee and the trustee board approve the expenses.

            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: Trainer Darius Byramjis Conquering Love and Vijay Singhs Exclusivity may fight out the issue in the 1,200m Star Magic Cup, the main attraction in Sundays eight-event card. However, Conquering Love appears to have a marginal edge over his main rival and the topweighted horse may score in the hands of jockey C. Alford.

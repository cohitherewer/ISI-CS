The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Razzano in semis
                                                   Razzano in semis
                      
	Dubai: Virginie Razzano upset fifth seeded Russian Vera Zvonareva 7-6, 7-5 on Thursday to set up a semi-final date with Estonias Kaia Kanepi at the Dubai Championships.         
	Unseeded Frenchwoman Razzano came out firing from the start of the two hour 23-minute match, which consisted of furiously-contested baseline rallies right until the final ball.         
	Razzano squandered a 5-3 lead in the first set before clinching it by winning the tiebreak 9-7.         
	After trading seven breaks of serve in the second set, Razzano sealed victory with a backhand winner down the line.         
	Kanepi is expected to become the first Estonian to break into the worlds top 20 after following up her victory against Jelena Jankovic with a 6-3, 7-5 win over Russian qualifier Elena Vesnina.         
	Kanepi placed Vesnina under pressure from the start and broke for a 4-2 lead with a scorching forehand and went on to win the set. The second set was more closely contested.         
	Kanepi served for the match at 5-4 but was broken to love. She regained the advantage in the next game and served out for victory at her second opportunity.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Taylor-made win for England
                                                   Taylor-made win for England
                      
	London: Claire Taylor produced a scintillating unbeaten 76 as England recovered from a sluggish start to snatch a dramatic eight-wicket victory over Australia and storm into the final of the womens Twenty20 World Cup here Friday.         
	Chasing a stiff target of 164, the hosts rode Taylors 53-ball unbeaten knock and her match-winning 122-run partnership with Beth Morgan (46) to romp home with three balls to spare. It was a remarkable come-from-behind victory for England who were looking down the barrel at one stage, but Taylor and Morgan unleashed a flurry of strokes in the later half of the innings to leave the Aussies in a daze.         
	England will now take on New Zealand in the final on Sunday. Earlier, put into bat, Australia rode some useful contributions from Leah Poulton, Shelley Nitschke and Karen Rolton, to post 163 for five.

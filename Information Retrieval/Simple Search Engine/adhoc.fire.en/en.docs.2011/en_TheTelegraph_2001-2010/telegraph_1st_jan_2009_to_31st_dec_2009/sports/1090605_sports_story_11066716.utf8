The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Symonds, the enfant terrible, to head home
                                                     Symonds, the enfant terrible, to head home
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES              Symonds                           
	Calcutta/London: Andrew Symondss World Twenty20 campaign came to end even before it started, when he was being sent home on Thursday. His career seemed to be as good as over as Cricket Australia (CA) called the incident the final straw for the all-rounder.                    
	The Event Technical Committee of the ICC World Twenty20 has approved of Cameron White as a replacement for Andrew Symonds in the Australia squad. The confirmation was conveyed to Cricket Australia on Thursday.                 
	According to CAs chief executive officer James Sutherland, the decision to send Symonds home was taken due to an alcohol-related breach of rules and other violations.         
	Sutherland and Australia captain Ricky Ponting declined to give specifics of the misbehaviour. The breach of team rules of itself was not a major offence, but was, in effect, the final straw after a series of previous indiscretions and in the light of the undertakings Andrew had given, Sutherland said.         
	Sources said Symonds have had one or two drinks at a gathering with teammates to watch Queensland play a rugby match on Wednesday, and breached personal behavioural terms imposed as part of CAs rehabilitation programme. He was also absent from the practice session.         
	The Queensland all-rounder has a record of off-field problems dating back to Australias last tour to England in 2005, when he was banned for two matches after arriving drunk for an ODI.         
	Were all disappointed with what happened over the last 24 hours, Ponting said. Losing one of the best Twenty20 players in the world is obviously not ideal.         
	The past 18 months have been the most tumultuous of Symonds career.         
	In January 2008, he was at the centre of the Monkeygate scandal in the home series against India.         
	He missed the return tour to India after going fishing in September instead of attending a team meeting.         
	Symonds won a recall for the series against New Zealand in November but was subjected to an investigation soon after, following reports of a brawl at a bar.         
	He was cleared of that charge but fined again in January for making derogatory comments about a player in a radio interview. He was allegedly drunk during that interview.

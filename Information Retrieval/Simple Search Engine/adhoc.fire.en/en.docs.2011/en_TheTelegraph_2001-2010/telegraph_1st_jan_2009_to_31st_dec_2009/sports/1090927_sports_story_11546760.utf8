The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saha scores in Everton victory
                                                   Saha scores in Everton victory
                      
	London: Portsmouths woes deepened Saturday as Everton inflicted a seventh straight defeat to keep the club pointless and rooted to the bottom of the Premier League.         
	Evertons 1-0 victory at Fratton Park was clinched in the 42nd minute by Louis Sahas seventh goal of the season.         
	The French striker brought down a long, high ball and went past Younes Kaboul before unleashing a clinical strike past goalkeeper David James.         
	Pompey could have equalised twice in the closing minutes, but Hassan Yebdas header was cleared off the line by Leighton Baines and Everton keeper Tim Howard blocked Kevin-Prince Boatengs shot.         
	Everton had lost Steven Pienaar earlier in the second half, when the midfielder was stretchered off following a collision with Aaron Mokoena.         
	In marked contrast to Pompeys miserable plight, leader Chelsea was chasing a seventh consecutive league victory later Saturday at Wigan to maintain their perfect record.         
	Also Saturday, defending champion Manchester United was at Stoke, Liverpool hosted Hull, Tottenham took on Burnley, Aston Villa was at Blackburn, Birmingham entertained Bolton and Arsenal crossed London to Fulham.

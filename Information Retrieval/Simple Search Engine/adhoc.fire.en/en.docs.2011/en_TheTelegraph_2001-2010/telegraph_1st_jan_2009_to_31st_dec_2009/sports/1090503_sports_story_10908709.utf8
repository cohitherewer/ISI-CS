The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Challengers look to continue run
                                                   Challengers look to continue run
                      
	Johannesburg: Royal Challengers Bangalore, the surprise package so far in the Indian Premier League 2009, will aim to spring another surprise when they take on the in-form Mumbai Indians here Sunday.         
	Back to back wins over the Kolkata Knight Riders and the Kings XI Punjab in the last two matches have not just lifted the Royal Challengers spirits but have also helped the team rise from the bottom to fifth on the points table.         
	Mumbai, on the other hand, are in good form as well. After the narrow defeat against the Kings XI, the Sachin Tendulkar-led outfit bounced back to beat the struggling Knight Riders Friday. Mumbai are currently third on the points table with three wins from six matches, one of which was washed out.         
	Mumbais explosive batting gives them a slight edge over the Royal Challengers.

	Karachi: A resilient Sri Lanka produced a clinical display to crush Pakistan by 129 runs in the second one-dayer to level the three-match series 1-1 here Wednesday.         
	Put into bat, the islanders first amassed 290 runs for eight wickets with Tillekeratne Dilshan and Thilina Kandamby laying the foundation and Chamara Kapugedera providing a late flourish with his 39-ball cameo of 44.         
	Sri Lankan bowlers then complemented the batting effort by skittling out Pakistan for 161 in 34.5 overs for a series-equalling victory. Muttiah Muralidharan and Ajantha Mendis shared six wickets between them to sink Pakistan.

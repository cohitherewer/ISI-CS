The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pepper foam warning for unruly fans
                                                   Pepper foam warning for unruly fans
                      
	Melbourne police have expressed confidence that they can prevent a third successive year of violence and disorder at the Australian Open. A riot in the picnic area during the 2007 tournament was followed by last seasons controversy when officers used pepper spray as they attempted to remove abusive fans from one of the outside courts.         
	For the first time, all officers at Melbourne Park will carry canisters of pepper foam, which will allow the police to target a person more directly than would be possible with the spray.         
	Two years ago, age-old Balkan enmities came alive at the tennis, with Serbian and Croatian supporters exchanging insults before they attacked their rivals with fists, sticks, beer cups, bottles and flagpoles, and about 150 spectators were later removed from the grounds.         
	Last season police used pepper spray as they tried to deal with a group of male Greek fans who had been chanting abusively at Chilean Fernando Gonzalez. The Greeks then acted in an aggressive and threatening manner towards the police. It was later suggested by witnesses that some of the women and children in the crowd had inadvertently been dosed with the pepper spray, with footage of the confrontation uploaded on to the internet.         
	So the sports image here has not exactly been as cuddly as a koalas, but Tennis Australia want to ensure that there is a family-friendly environment at the opening grand slam of the year.         
	If there is a similar incident at this years Australian Open, where Andy Murray is the bookmakers favourite for the mens singles, police will be better equipped to deal with any troublesome spectators.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

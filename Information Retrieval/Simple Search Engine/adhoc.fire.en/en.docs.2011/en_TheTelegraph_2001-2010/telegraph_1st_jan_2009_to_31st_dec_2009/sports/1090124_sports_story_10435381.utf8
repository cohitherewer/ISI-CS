	What are the qualities of an ideal captain?
  (Ankit Pattnaik, 17, Rourkela)              
	He has to be a good student of the game. Has to have good man management qualities and must be cool under pressure and tactically sound.                
	I am a right-arm medium-pacer. How does one swing the new ball?
  (Deborshi Mukherjee, 16, Calcutta-40)  
	You need a good action and also check with your coach your grip and wrist position.                
	I am a right-arm medium-pacer. To keep the batsman guessing should I hide the ball when running in to bowl?
  (Mayank Surana, 15, Shillong)  
	Not necessarily unless the ball is swinging. And for that to happen you got to have the ability to swing the ball both ways to start with.                
	I am a pacer. Whenever I try to increase pace I end up bowling full tosses. Please help.
  (Pranjol Dutta, 19, Guwahati-2)  
	Make sure in striving for that extra yard of pace you dont lose your balance at time of delivery and your head position is very important.    
	I am a left-arm medium-pacer. I often bowl wides when trying to bowl wicket to wicket. Please help.
  (Samrat Das, 14, Howrah)  
	Watch the spot you want the ball to land and work on your action with your coach.                
	I am a righthanded batsman. I often get dismissed by slower deliveries. Please help.
  (Tanmoy Nandy, 19, Howrah)  
	Keep your eyes on the ball. And watch it come out of the bowlers hand.                
	I am a medium-pacer. How important is sledging at the batsman when bowling?(Sukrit Dey, 19, Calcutta)  
	First have the ability before you think of mind games.                
	How can one improve concentration when batting and bowling?
  (Amit Kr Shaw, 17, Calcutta-29)  
	Keep talking to yourself and focus on your shot selection.                
	I am an off-spinner and would like to know the ideal length for bowling an off break?
  (Pratik Ganguly, 19, Calcutta)  
	The ideal length is one where you make the batsman grope forward.                
	I am an off-spinner. I find it very tough to bowl on a turning track because the ball turns too much and I fail to control it. Please help.
  (Ramen Saha, 21, Calcutta-22)  
	Work on your line when the ball is turning too much. Also dont hesitate in bowling around the wicket.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Safina gets past Venus 
                                                   Safina gets past Venus 
                      
	Rome: World No. 1 Dinara Safina came from a set down to win an epic contest with Venus Williams 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 6-4 on Friday and set up an all-Russian final at the Italian Open.         
	Safina rallied from a set and 0-2 down to earn the right to face her compatriot Svetlana Kuznetsova, who barged past Belarussian Victoria Azarenka with a 6-2, 6-4 win.         
	Venus won the first set in a tiebreak and took a 2-0 lead in the second before Safina stormed back by winning six of the next seven games to even things up.         
	The Russian twice let a break advantage slip in the third set before finally clinching an enthralling match that lasted over three hours. (Reuters)

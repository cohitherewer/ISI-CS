The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dinara, Serena to battle for top spot 
                                                   Dinara, Serena to battle for top spot 
                      
	London: The equation could not be simpler  whoever performs best out of Russian Dinara Safina and American Serena Williams at this weeks WTA Championships in Doha, that begins Tuesday, will end the year as world No. 1.         
	Sundays draw appeared to hand the advantage to 23-year-old Safina as she was placed in the easier of the two four-women groups that will be contested at the Khalifa Tennis Centre on the shores of the Persian Gulf.         
	She will face late qualifier Jelena Jankovic of Serbia, the 2008 year-end No. 1, and tournament debutants Caroline Wozniacki, the US Open runner-up from Denmark, and Victoria Azarenka of Belarus, in the White Group.         
	Serena, who claimed the No. 1 spot from Safina at the China Open earlier this month, lost it to the Russian on Monday.         
	The American is also in the much tougher Maroon Group in Doha where she must play sister Venus, the defending champion, and formidable Russians Svetlana Kuznetsova, the French Open winner, and Olympic gold medallist Elena Dementieva.         
	To have the battle for No.1 going to the wire is a dream scenario for womens tour chiefs and the Qatari tennis authorities who paid $42 million to stage the season-ending event for three years until it moves to Istanbul in 2011.         
	If both players, Serena and Dinara go out at the same stage the No. 1 ranking will probably be decided by who wins most round-robin matches which are each worth 160 ranking points. The Russian currently has a 155 point advantage over the American.

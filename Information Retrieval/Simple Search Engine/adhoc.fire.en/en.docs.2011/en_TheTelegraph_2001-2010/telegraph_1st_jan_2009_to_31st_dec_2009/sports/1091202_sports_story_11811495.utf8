            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: National footballers, led by skipper Bhaichung Bhutia, have submitted a letter with their signatures to the All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Praful Patel expressing dismay over the suspensions of Dempo duo, Mahesh Gawli and Samir Naik.         
	The AIFF had Sunday suspended the two for not attending the ongoing national camp in Goa.         
	We are surprised. Instead of taking the club to task, the federation suspended these two players. The players never wanted to skip the camp. If the club doesnt allow them they are helpless. We were not aware of their suspensions and came to know about it through the media, Bhutia said from Goa.         
	In the letter, the players said that instead of addressing the root cause of the problem, the AIFF was making players the easy targets.         
	They hoped that Patel would look into the matter and deliver a just decision.

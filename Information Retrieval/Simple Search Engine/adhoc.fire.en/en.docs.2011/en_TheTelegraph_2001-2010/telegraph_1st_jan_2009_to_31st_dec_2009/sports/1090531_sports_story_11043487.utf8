	Paris: Novak Djokovic became the first big-name player to be eliminated from the mens tournament at the French Open, losing to No.29 Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany 4-6, 4-6, 4-6 in the third round Saturday.               
	Roger Federer came back from a set down to reach the fourth round with a 4-6, 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 victory over Frenchman Paul-Henri Mathieu               
	The fourth-seeded Serb reached the semi-finals at Roland Garros in each of the last two years, but could do little against Kohlschreiber while playing for the third time in three days.         
	What is disappointing was that I couldnt find the rhythm throughout the whole match, said Djokovic, who completed a suspended three-set win from the previous round on Friday. I was trying not to be frustrated with a lot of unforced errors. Tried to be positive and just wait for the chances.         
	Djokovic finished the match with 38 unforced errors, 16 more than Kohlschreiber. He didnt give me a lot of chances. But yet again, I didnt work for those chances, Djokovic said. This is the problem. I played too passive, and he played really solid from all the strokes.         
	No.6 Andy Roddick managed to stick around, however, reaching the French Opens fourth round for the first time by beating Marc Gicquel of France 6-1, 6-4, 6-4.         
	Fifth seed Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina also reached the fourth round, as did No.2 Serena Williams and No.5 Jelena Jankovic from the womens draw.         
	Roddick is only the second American to advance this far at the clay-court major since Andre Agassi in 2003, the same year Roddick won the US Open. Robby Ginepri also made the fourth round in Paris last year.         
	Its three matches, said Roddick, who had seven aces and only 11 unforced errors. Its a lot better than Ive done here before.         
	Roddick has reached at least the semi-finals at the other three majors. Besides winning the 2003 US Open, he also is a two-time runner-up at Wimbledon. But at the French Open, Roddicks best performance before this year was the third round in his 2001 debut.         
	I like my chances maybe more than the other years, Roddick said. I feel like Im moving a little bit better on this stuff. Im able to kind of slide into my forehand.         
	Del Potro beat Igor Andreev of Russia 6-4, 7-5, 6-4, while No.9 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France, compatriot and No.11 Gael Monfils, No.16 Tommy Robredo of Spain and Tommy Haas of Germany also gained the fourth round.         
	On the womens side, fourth seed Elena Dementieva lost to No.30 Samantha Stosur of Australia 3-6, 6-4, 1-6.         
	I just feel Im far away from... being in good shape, Dementieva said. I feel like I couldnt perform any better.         
	Stosur has never before reached the fourth round at the French Open. She made it that far at the 2006 Australian Open, but has never played in the quarter finals at a major.         
	As that match went on today (Saturday) I knew I could get there because I was playing (well) enough and was handling the conditions and everything maybe a little bit better than her, Stosur said.         
	Serena Williams rallied to beat Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez of Spain 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, while Jankovic defeated 73rd-ranked Jarmila Groth of Australia 6-1, 6-1. No.7 Svetlana Kuznetsova beat Melinda Czink6-1, 6-3.         
	I cruised through the match and did my job, did what I had to do in order to win, said Jankovic, who, after starting the season as the top-ranked womens player has since dropped to No.5.         
	No.9 Victoria Azarenka of Belarus completed her comeback over No.22 Carla Suarez Navarro of Spain 5-7, 7-5, 6-2. Suarez Navarro won the first set Friday and Azarenka took the second before play was suspended because of darkness.         
	No.12 Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland, No.24 Aleksandra Wozniak of Canada and unseeded Virginie Razzano of France also advanced. (AP)

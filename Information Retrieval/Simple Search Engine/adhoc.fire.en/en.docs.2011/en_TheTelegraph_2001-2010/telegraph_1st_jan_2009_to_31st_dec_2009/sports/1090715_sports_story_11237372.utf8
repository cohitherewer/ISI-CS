The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bangla bowlers fined
                                                   Bangla bowlers fined
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bangladesh bowlers Shakib-al Hasan and Shahadat Hossain have been fined 10 and five per cent of their match fees respectively, for excessive appealing in the first Test against the West Indies, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Tuesday.         
	Opener Imrul Kayes was officially reprimanded for the same breach during the match, which Bangladesh won for only their second victory in 60 Tests. Kayes avoided a fine with the ICC saying it accepted that he was still new to international cricket.         
	I can understand the enthusiasm and excitement on the field as the Bangladesh players were sensing a long-awaited victory and their first in the West Indies, match referee Andy Pycroft said in statement.         
	But excessive and prolonged appealing on more than one occasion is against the spirit of the game and has no place in the game.

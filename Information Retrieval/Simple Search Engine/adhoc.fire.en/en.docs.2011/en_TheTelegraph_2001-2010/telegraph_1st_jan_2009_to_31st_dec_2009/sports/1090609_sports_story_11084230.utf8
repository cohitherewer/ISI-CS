                                                     Younis: Cant teach fielding at this stage
                  Younis Khan                     
	Karachi: Pakistan captain Younis Khan has lashed out at the sloppy fielding of his teammates and asked them to lift their standards ahead of the crucial match against The Netherlands in the ICC World Twenty20.         
	I cannot take a stick and start caning them if they misfield. It does not work that way in international cricket. Each player must realise his own individual responsibility in the team, Younis told a TV channel after the match against England.         
	Pakistan dropped at least four chances and misfielded several times as they collapsed under pressure. Former Test players and critics have said that Younis needed to be more strict and aggressive on the field with his players to lift the declining fielding standards of the team.         
	But Younis disagreed, insisting he could not teach the players, at this level, how to field.         
	Look, if I start scolding or shouting at new players like Saeed Ajmal or Ahmed Shahzad every time they misfield, then they will lose confidence even as a bowler or batsman, the Pakistan skipper said.         
	Meanwhile, His comments that Twenty20 is played just for fun and it would not be a disaster if his team fails to make the Super Eight stage has ruffled some feathers in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).         
	It would be sad if we dont make it but I have never attached too much importance to Twenty20 cricket, as it is played for fun, Younis said.         
	The PCB has asked for confirmation and explanation from the management about Younis comments.         
	A former Test player, requesting anonymity, went on to question Younis integrity and said: If he is not interested in playing Twenty20 cricket, then why did he go to England in the first place?

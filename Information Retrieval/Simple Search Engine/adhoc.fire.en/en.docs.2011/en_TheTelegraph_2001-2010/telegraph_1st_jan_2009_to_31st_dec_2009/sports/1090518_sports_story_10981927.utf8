	Madrid: Barcelona were gifted their 19th Primera Liga title without kicking a ball on Saturday when second-placed Real Madrid were beaten 2-3 at Villarreal.         
	Robert Pires, Cani and Joan Capdevila scored for the hosts, delivering Barcas second piece of silverware in a week after the Catalans overcame Athletic Bilbao 4-1 in the Kings Cup final on Wednesday.         
	Barca can make it a treble by defeating Manchester United in the Champions League final in Rome on May 27.         
	Real have 78 points and two games left, eight points shy of Barcelona . The visitors looked short on confidence and ideas at the Madrigal and fell behind when Pires headed home Ariel Ibagazas cross in the 17th minute.

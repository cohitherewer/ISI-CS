The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team India lacked planning: Arjuna
                                                     Team India lacked planning: Arjuna
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Arjuna Ranatunga                           
	Nottingham: In Arjuna Ranatungas opinion, lack of planning had much to do with Team Indias failure to qualify for the semi-finals of the ongoing World T20.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men had won the inaugural edition, two years ago.         
	Your team didnt plan well... That contributed in a big way to bowing out from the Super Eights, Ranatunga, a (50-over) World Cup-winning captain, told The Telegraph.         
	Also a former chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), Ranatunga came to Trent Bridge on Tuesday to watch the double-header: Sri Lanka versus New Zealand and India versus South Africa.         
	Im happy that our team has been winning, but I fear the batting is a little shaky... Our bowling, on the other hand, has been fantastic... (Lasith) Malinga, (Muttiah) Muralidharan and (Ajantha) Mendis have all been having it their way, Ranatunga added.         
	According to Ranatunga, Sri Lankas best chance of winning the tournament would be to avoid meeting South Africa in the semi-finals.         
	That wasnt clear when our conversation took place.         
	Ranatunga, meanwhile, said that he would sue sports minister Gamini Lokuge for as much as $10 million.         
	The Supreme Court, it may be recalled, has upheld Ranatungas contention that his removal from the SLC chairmans position, by Lokuge, had been wrongful.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wicket the cynosure, again
                                                                                                                       7                                      Wicket the cynosure, again
    - Final test lanka may opt for extra pacer at the expense of mendis             K. KUMARASWAMY                            
	Mumbai: Pitch has been the talking point right through the ongoing series between India and Sri Lanka. That did not change on the eve of the third and final Test of the Jaypee Cup, which starts here at the Brabourne Stadium on Wednesday. The wickets sporting nature and the slopes on either side of it are being talked about.         
	For Kumar Sangakkara, the Sri Lanka captain, the slope at the Cricket Club of India is not the only thing to worry about.         
	The tourists arrived in India with sky-high confidence following back to back series wins over Pakistan and New Zealand, but have struggled to make things happen in this country.         
	Before the start of the series, the Lankans were talking of India as the last frontier, as it was with Steve Waughs Australia in 2001.         
	One could not have found fault with that approach as they had won nine of the 14 Tests they have played since the beginning of 2008.         
	But three weeks into the series, Sangakkaras men are a battered and bruised lot, and their quest for winning a Test on Indian soil remains a dream.         
	On the other hand, the hosts, who were left licking their wounds after the ODI series loss to Australia in the lead up to the Sri Lanka series, are buoyant after taking a 1-0 lead.         
	Moreover, also up for the grab is the No.1 ranking in Tests and a 2-0 victory in the series will lift Dhoni and Co. to the summit.         
	Suddenly, as is natural for a winning side, the team management is so confident that they have released Gautam Gambhir, a key member of the team, to attend his sisters wedding.         
	The pitch provides hope for the visitors. One of the main reasons behind Sri Lankas below par performance in this series has been Muttiah Muralidharans indifferent form. As the pitch here is expected to offer more turn and bounce than the Motera and Green Park tracks, the highest wicket-taker in Tests can hope to put up a better show in his last Test in India.         
	The Brabourne track traditionally retains a bit of moisture and combined with coastal breeze, it would provide enough encouragement for the seamers as well.         
	Sri Lanka, therefore, are likely to go for a third seamer, instead of playing three spinners as they did in Kanpur. Nuwan Kulasekera is likely to share the new ball with Chanaka Welegedara, while Murali and Rangana Herath will be the two spinners.         
	That the headlines during the series have been less about the Indian team and more about security and the pitches, says a lot about their performance.         
	They thrashed the visitors by a huge margin in Kanpur, but that was expected of them. They are expected to win the decider as well.         
	With expectations comes pressure. It would be interesting to see how Mahendra Singh Dhonis men handle the pressure. That would be as crucial in determining the outcome of the match as the much talked about slope.         
	Teams         
	India (likely): Murali Vijay, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, VVS Laxman, Yuvraj Singh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Sreesanth, Pragyan Ojha.         
	Sri Lanka (from): Kumar Sangakkara, Tillekaratne Dilshan, Tharanga Paranavitana, Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews, Thilan Samaraweera, Prasanna Jayawardene, Muttiah Muralidharan, Nuwan Kulasekera, Rangana Herath, Chanaka Welegedara, Dilhara Fernando, Ajantha Mendis, Thilina Kandamby, Damika Prasad, Kaushal Silva.         
	Umpires: Daryl Harper (Aus) and Nigel Llong (Eng); TV: Shavir Tarapore (Ind).         
	Match starts: 9.30am.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Younis Khan anger makes panel chief backtrack 
                                                     Younis Khan anger makes panel chief backtrack 
            OUR BUREAU AMP; AGENCIES            Younis Khan and Intikhab Alam                           
	Calcutta/Karachi: Strong reaction from Pakistan captain Younis Khan and coach Intikhab Alam has forced Jamshed Khan Dasti, the chairman of the national assemblys standing committee on sports, to backtrack on the allegations of match-fixing that he had levelled against the team.         
	National coach Alam blamed the Indian media for the latest controversy to rock Pakistan cricket while Younis has simply rubbished the allegations.         
	Indeed, the Pathan even threatened to resign from the captaincy over the match-fixing row. All this has led Dasti, the man who had stirred the hornets nest by claiming that the Younis Khans had tanked their Champions Trophy match against Australia, to do a somersault and say that he had never made such allegations.         
	I never said the Pakistani players indulged in any match-fixing against Australia or New Zealand. What I was trying to say has been completely misunderstood by everyone, Dasti offered in explanation.         
	Intikhab, for his part, has accused the Indian media of triggering off and fanning the row. He has also asked the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to decide whether there is any need to restore cricketing ties with India as the neighbours seem hell bent on damaging them.         
	All this stuff about our team being involved in match-fixing started because of reports in some Indian newspapers and since then they have carried out a relentless campaign to defame us, the coach said.         
	The truth is that it is hard for the Indians to digest the fact that this year, in two major tournaments, their team was eliminated in the first round and our team not only won the World T20 but also reached the semi-final of the Champions Trophy, he said.         
	Alam continued: Maybe it is time we also reviewed our cricketing relations with India and decided whether we really needed to play them when they are hell bent on trying to damage us, said Alam, who had coached the Punjab Ranji team in India.         
	So shocked has been Younis that he has decided to meet PCB chief Ejaz Butt to discuss the issue. It came as a shock to me that such allegations have been made without any evidence, Younis said.         
	The captain further backed up the indignation with defiance, insisting he would not hesitate to relinquish captaincy if need be: I have struggled all my life, so I am not bothered about losing the captaincy or not being able to play for the team. Im always prepared to face any situation.         
	The captain and coach duo has been appalled that such serious allegations have been made without any evidence to back them up.         
	Without any evidence or proof how can he make such allegations? was what Intikhab had to say.         
	Dasti, however, claimed that all he wanted to do was look into concerns, expressed in some quarters, that Pakistan might have deliberately lost their matches to Australia and New Zealand.         
	As to the hearing in question, Younis has said he had yet to decide whether he would attend the same.         
	Meanwhile, ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat, in Johannesburg, rubbished the allegations and also gave a clean chit to Australian umpire Simon Taufel who was officiating the match.

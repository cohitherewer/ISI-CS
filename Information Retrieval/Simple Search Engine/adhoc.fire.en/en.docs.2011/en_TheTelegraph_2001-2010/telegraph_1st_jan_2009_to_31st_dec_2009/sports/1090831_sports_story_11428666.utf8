The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I may not play again: Flintoff
                                                     I may not play again: Flintoff
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH    
	London: Andrew Flintoff has conceded that he may never play cricket again.         
	The 31-year-old underwent surgery on his long-standing knee injury after helping England seal their second consecutive home Ashes series win at the Oval last weekend.         
	Flintoff hopes to be back in action by March, but he told a newspaper: There is a possibility I may not play again. Its something Im going to have to be prepared for in case the operation is not as successful as I hope.         
	There will be a question mark in my mind about whether I have played my last game until I know how the operation has turned out. Id be lying if I said it hadnt crossed my mind, but the success rate for an operation like this is pretty good. The bottom line is that if it doesnt work, theres nothing I can do about it.         
	But I dont want my career to end like this. My Test career ended on a high by England winning the Ashes and Id like to finish my one-day career by winning the World Cup.         
	Flintoff played through the pain at the Oval after missing the Headingley Test, but looked far from his best, with his only telling contribution coming in the second innings in the form of Ricky Pontings run out.         
	He said: The day after the Ashes win, I went for a scan which confirmed my knee problem had got worse. I was really struggling towards the end of the final Test. The next few weeks are quite crucial in the recovery and Im not supposed to put any weight on my knee.         
	In the past, when Ive been on crutches for two or three weeks, my leg has been terrible, so this time its going to be awful. I will see the specialist in a couple of weeks and then have another eight-week check-up. Its only then well know the extent of my injury.         
	I have set myself a target of returning for the tour to Bangladesh, which is from mid-February to the middle of March, but whether thats realistic or not, Im not sure, Flintoff said.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Top England stars, including Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff, will be available for the Indian Premier League (IPL) both this year and the next season after the BCCI and the ECB reached an agreement on Tuesday.         
	A joint statement issued by the two boards said the England players would play in the IPL for a minimum of three weeks in 2009 and 2010.         
	The agreement put to rest the uncertainty over the availability of the England players in the IPL auction on February 6 in Goa.         
	The BCCI and ECB added they had also agreed to schedule Test match and one-day International series over a four-year period starting in 2011.

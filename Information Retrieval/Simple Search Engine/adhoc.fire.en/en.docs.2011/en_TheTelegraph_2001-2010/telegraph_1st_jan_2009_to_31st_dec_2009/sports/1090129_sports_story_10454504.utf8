The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kalighat accused of ball tampering
                                                   Kalighat accused of ball tampering
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting on Wednesday refused to return to the field after alleging that Kalighat players had tampered with the ball during a CAB first division league match.         
	The CAB, which imposed fines on Mohun Bagan and East Bengal only on Tuesday, is faced with yet another on-field spat. Of late, Kalighat, who won all five local trophies last season, have found themselves in the midst of a number of controversies.         
	Deciding to bat first at the High Court ground, Mohammedan Sporting were reeling at 107 for six with medium-pacer Avik Chowdhury spitting fire with a spell of five for 44.         
	The spectators, complaining that Kalighat players were applying vaseline on the ball, marched onto the ground and disrupted the match.         
	The umpires  Subhasish Chatterjee and Mukesh Sinha  after a brief hold-up, asked Mohammedan Sporting to continue with the match but they declined. The umpires have already submitted the ball and their report to the CAB.         
	According to sources, the umpires have said in their report that there was no evidence of ball tampering and mentioned that Mohammedan Sporting declined to continue playing.         
	Mohammedan Sporting later lodged a formal complaint of ball tampering with the CAB. Joint secretary Arun Mitra said he was yet to see the umpires report.

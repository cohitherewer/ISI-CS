The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The bouncer that floored Tendulkar
                                                   The bouncer that floored Tendulkar
                      
	New Delhi: In a two-decade long career, the only bouncer Sachin Tendulkar found tough to negotiate came from his son, who would refuse to speak to him on phone during tours, out of sheer annoyance over his absence from home.         
	Tendulkar, who will complete two decades in international cricket in November, disclosed that his son did not like him leaving home frequently and wouldnt come on phone until six years of age.         
	It was tough initially, because my son did not like it when I left home. For the first five-six years of his life, he did not speak to me on phone. That was difficult for me, Sachin said.         
	Now he (Arjun) knows what I do and he appreciates that; so thats nice. I am a family man and they now know that I play for India, he added.         
	Asked whether he wanted his son to become a cricketer, Sachin said he would not force Arjun to play the game. I have left that to him. He has started playing cricket and my daughter plays tennis. I dont want to force them anything. It has to come from their side, he said in a TV interview.         
	Sachin has all along been saying that he does not play the game to break records, but conceded that he had one in mind while starting his career, and that was to surpass his idol Sunil Gavaskars 35 Test hundreds.

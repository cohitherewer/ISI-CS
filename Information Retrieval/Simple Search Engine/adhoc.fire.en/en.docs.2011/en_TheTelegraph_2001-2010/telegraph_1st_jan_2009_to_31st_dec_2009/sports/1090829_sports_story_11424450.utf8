                                                   Kyrgyzstan beat Lanka, finish third
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: All the talks about Sri Lanka coming at par with India in the points tally proved futile after they lost 1-4 by Kyrgyzstan in the inconsequential Nehru Cup match at the Ambedkar Stadium Friday.         
	While Kyrgyzstan finished their engagements with four points in the five-nation round robin, Sri Lanka had to remain content with three points.         
	Syria with nine points top the group at the moment, followed by India, who have six points. India and Syria will play in the last league match on Saturday and again in the final on Monday.         
	The victory, however, brought joy to the Kyrgyzstan camp as it ensured them the third place in the tournament and a cash award of $10,000.         
	Kyrgyzstan, who led 2-0 at the breather, opened the scoring through Anton Zemlianuhin in the 34th minute and struck again a minute before the half-time via Ildar Amirov.         
	In the second session, Lanka went into the attacking mode to pull one back through skipper Chathura Maduranga in the 53rd minute. The joy was short-lived as Kyrgyzstan pumped in two more to complete the rout.         
	Teams         
	Kyrgyzstan: Maskim Agapov; Abitov Faruh, Anton Zemlianuhin and Azmazbek Mirzaliev; Sergey Kaluetin, Mirlan Murzaev, Davron Askarov, Vadim Harchenko and Ildar Amirov (Pavel Sidorenko, 74th); Roman Albamikov and Rustem Usanov.

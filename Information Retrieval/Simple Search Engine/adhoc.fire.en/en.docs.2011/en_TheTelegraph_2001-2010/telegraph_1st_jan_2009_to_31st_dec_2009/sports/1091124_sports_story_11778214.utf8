The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shukla has a deputy, at last
                                                                                                                       7                                      Shukla has a deputy, at last
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Common sense suggests, before the start of a tournament, a captain and a vice-captain should be named. But the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), so far, had avoided doing that.         
	First, they were reluctant in naming a captain for the entire season. Moreover, they had denied the necessity of naming a vice-captain. The result  controversies, controversies and more controversies.         
	Three matches into the Ranji Trophy, common sense prevailed on Monday as the CAB named Manoj Tiwary the vice-captain of Bengal, on the eve of their crucial tie against Saurashtra at the Eden.         
	Tiwary, in fact, will lead the side against Saurashtra as captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla was omitted from the squad because of fitness issues.         
	While former India captain Sourav Ganguly and Rohan Gavaskar made a comeback, spinner Shib Sagar Singh and batsman Arindam Ghosh were dropped. But while Tiwarys appointment is a welcome news, Shuklas omission has sparked off a new controversy.         
	Shukla had missed Bengals last match against Karnataka. Dr Vece Paes, Bengals fitness consultant, was not satisfied with the all-rounders fitness test Sunday, and had decided to have a re-look Monday.         
	According to sources, Dr Paes thought Shukla needs a little more rest, and his opinion influenced the selectors.         
	Though Dr Paes admitted that Shukla was recovering well, he told the selectors that the captain should be rested from this match, in order to ensure his availability for the rest of the season. Thats the reason the all-rounder was not risked, said a source.         
	However, it was learnt that Shukla himself had expressed his wish to play the match, and had said in the morning that he is fit. Sources added that he didnt expect the omission and was quite upset with it.         
	Dr Paes, on the other hand, did not pinpoint Shuklas problem.         
	Asked why the selection was delayed till the eve of the match, CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey said: We wanted to be sure about Shukla, and so waited till today (Monday).

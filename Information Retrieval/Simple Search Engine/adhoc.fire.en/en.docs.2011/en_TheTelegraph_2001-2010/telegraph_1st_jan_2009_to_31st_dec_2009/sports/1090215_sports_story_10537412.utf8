The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | For Bagan, Md. Sp. is the team to beat 
                                                     For Bagan, Md. Sp. is the team to beat 
    - I-LEAGUE 
  - Green and Maroon brigade look for a perfect ten today             A STAFF REPORTER            Mohun Bagan players stretch during a practice session at the club ground on Saturday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh                                 
	Calcutta: The fact that Mohun Bagan have not beaten Mohammedan Sporting this season (a loss and a draw in the Calcutta League followed by another 1-1 draw in the first leg of the I-League) is not bugging coach Karim Bencharifa.         
	So, it was not surprising that on the eve of the I-League match between the city rivals, the Bagan coach was in his usual jovial mood.         
	Probably, the confidence comes from the nine wins on the trot, which have catapulated the green-and-maroon brigade to the top of the heap.         
	I wont dispute that, but you can be sure theres no complacency creeping into the system, the Moroccan said at the club tent on Saturday.         
	Sunday will be a tough match as Mohammedan Sporting are high on confidence after their win against JCT. But we have the character to pass this test, the man who will be celebrating his 41st birthday Sunday said.         
	Yes, Bagan have the character to leave the pitch with beaming faces. Their no-frills approach is the talk of the I-League. There hasnt been any flamboyance but Bhaichung Bhutia and Co. have been very effective.         
	If Bhaichung and Jose Ramirez Barreto are getting the goals, Ishfaq Ahmed and James Singh have been consistent with their deliveries from the flanks. Marcos Pereira and Rakesh Masih have been equally up to the task in the centre of the park.         
	Even the defence, which was stuttering when the season started, is rock solid. Conceding nine goals from 14 matches drives home the point that the Bagan back-four has been superb.         
	Agrees Mohammedan Sporting coach Shabbir Ali: They are the best team now. The fact that they havent beaten us this season will not have a bearing on Sunday.         
	But doesnt that win against JCT give Mohammedan Sporting a confidence boost? It has, says new arrival Eugene Gray. If we play to our strength it will be a different ball game, he adds.         
	Mohammedan Sporting will be missing Shovan Chakraborty who is nursing an ankle injury. And Shabbir is yet to decide on his replacement. It may be that Gautam Thakur will get a nod in.         
	Mohammedan Sporting officials, meanwhile, are leaving no stone unturned in pepping up the players.         
	They have already announced a Rs 1 lakh incentive if Mohammedan Sporting win Sundays match.         
	WIll Bencharifas boys allow their rivals to take home the incentive? We will have to wait till Sunday evening for the anwser.

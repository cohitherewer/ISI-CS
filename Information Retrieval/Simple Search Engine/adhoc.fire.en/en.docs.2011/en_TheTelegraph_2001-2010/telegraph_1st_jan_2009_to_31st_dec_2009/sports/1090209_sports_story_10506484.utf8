The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Strong start by South
                                                   Strong start by South
                      
	Chennai: Chasing a daunting target of 678 for victory, South Zone squandered the fine start given by their openers Robin Uthappa and Murali Vijay to end the fourth and penultimate day of the Duleep Trohpy final against West Zone at a precarious 232 for four here Sunday.         
	Still 446 runs adrift of an unlikely win, the hosts had captain and first-innings centurion Subramaniam Badrinath and wicketkeeper batsman Dinesh Karthik at the crease at stumps.         
	Souths chase went haywire after Vijay and Uthappas solid first-wicket stand of 165 came to an end. The duo negotiated the bowlers, particularly the spinners, confidently but both perished going for ambitious shots.         
	Former India captain Rahul Dravid was dismissed for a duck when spinner Ramesh Powars skidding delivery knocked off his stumps.         
	Powar earlier separated the opening pair, when Vijay edged one to Parthiv Patel. Uthappa, meanwhile, perished trying to hit Rajesh Pawar over mid-off, giving a simple catch to Siddarth Trivedi.         
	Uthappa, who was dropped by Wasim Jaffer at first slip on 17, made 94 off 98 balls with 12 boundaries and three mighty sixes.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A special victory: Dhoni
                                                   A special victory: Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Colombo: In what should be a boost before their Champions Trophy campaign, captain Mahendra Singh Dhonis men bearded Sri Lanka in their own den to clinch the Compaq Cup, the first digital trophy, on Monday.         
	India, who enjoyed the briefest of stints, for a day, at No.1 on the ICC ODI rankings after their defeat of New Zealand and slipped to No. 3 after losing to Lanka, are back at the No.2  the position where they were before the start of the series.         
	With a blistering 138 off 133 balls from Sachin Tendulkar and able assistance from Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh, India defeated the hosts by 46 runs. Harbhajan Singh did the star turn with the ball as he picked up five for 56.         
	Dhoni dedicated the victory to former Board of Control for Cricket in India chief, the late Raj Singh Dungarpur, who passed away on Saturday. He was the manager during our tour to Pakistan. He was a great man. We dedicate the victory to him, he said.         
	While expressing satisfaction that they had clinched an ODI trophy in Lanka after a long time (the last one being in 1998) Dhoni said: The victory is special It feels great to win a trophy in Sri Lanka after such a long time. Being the second-placed team in world rankings we have to keep performing well to sustain the quality. The boys are young and learning and we always try to give our best.         
	But he didnt give his team full marks saying there was much room for improvement in the fielding and the bowling departments.         
	We have got to learn from our mistakes We did lack a bit in the fielding and bowling departments and both are very crucial. Thankfully, we ended on the winning side today.         
	Dhoni lavished praise on Rahul Dravid for agreeing to open the innings as it allowed him to experiment with the batting order. The shuffling of the batting order was possible only because Rahul agreed to open. Its very difficult to ask him to change his batting order since he is so brilliant at No.3. But with him opening, I shuffled the batting order a bit which surprised them.         
	He also praised the Lankans for giving a determined chase. (Tillekaratne) Dilshan batted really well We just fed him with a lot of the short-pitched stuff that he relishes. We will be careful next time, he said.         
	Sachin bagged the Man of the Match and Man of the Series awards for his superlative performances.         
	It has been a lot of fun playing here. The conditions were different and so we did really well. Dhoni and Yuvraj batted excellently and then Harbhajan was fantastic with the ball. It was a good team effort, Sachin said.         
	Calling the match quite a tense affair, Sachin said he had bitten off all his nails in the process. Well, Ive lost all my nails But congratulations to Sri Lanka for putting up such a great show, he said.         
	He didnt agree that he had changed his style of playing: I didnt change my style But maybe the way people look at me has changed. He also added that his body has been holding up pretty well except for a few cramps.         
	Harbhajan, who claimed his third five-wicket haul on Monday, said: Its great to win a series in Sri Lanka after a long time. All the guys chipped in with useful contributions to take us to victory. But we could have bowled and fielded better.         
	Dhonis counterpart Kumar Sangakkara felt they could have won the match had the batsmen shown a little more responsibility.         
	We were in the hunt till the 43rd over. At one stage, we were ahead of the asking rate. But we kept losing crucial wickets and that brought the downfall. If the batsmen could have shown a bit more responsibility, we could have ended on the winning side.         
	We went close, but fell short in the end. But it was a good game today and Im proud of the effort my teammates put up, he added.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Bhaichung Bhutia has come a long way from his eye-catching debut in the Subroto Cup in 1991 to be acknowledged as the face of Indian football.         
	On Sunday, when India take on Kyrgyzstan in a must-win Nehru Cup encounter, the Indian skipper will achieve a personal landmark of playing his 100th match for India.         
	Bhaichungs international career began in the 1995 Nehru Cup in Calcutta. In the opener against Thailand, which India lost 0-5, Bhaichung was brought on as a substitute by coach Rustam Akhramov.         
	In the second match against the then Asian Games champions Uzbekistan, Bhaichung started with Kuljit Singh and struck a sensational goal with a flying header to pave the way for a shock Indian win.         
	Ive never had to come on as a substitute again for the national team, remembered Bhaichung.         
	Asked about his next target, Bhaichung said in a lighter vein: To play another 100 matches for India. The Indian captain is expected to be around at least till the 2011 Asian Cup final rounds.         
	Under Bhaichungs captaincy, India have won three tournaments  the LG Cup in Vietnam in 2002, the Nehru Cup in 2007 and the AFC Challenge Cup in 2008. The AIFF will present the captain with a memento before the match Sunday, with a felicitation lined up for August 30.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wake-up call for Symonds
                                                   Wake-up call for Symonds
                      
	Melbourne: Australias stand-in captain Michael Clarke thinks Andrew Symonds owes a debt to national selectors for choosing him for the one-dayers against Pakistan despite a poor domestic form and off-field controversies and now he should repay it by strong performance.         
	He comes into the group as every other player that walks back into the team. Cricket Australia (CA) have made it clear that he was right to come back and as captain Ive tried to make him as welcome as possible.         
	They (selectors) have shown faith on him by re-selecting him for this tour. Everybody knows hes a wonderful player when hes playing his best cricket, Clarke said.         
	This is probably a chance for him to repay selectors for showing plenty of faith in him. Its great that his bodys in good nick and that hes come back and hes in good spirits, Clarke was quoted as saying by an Australian news agency.         
	I dont know if its an Ashes trial, but weve got lots of cricket coming up. Weve got Ashes series, weve got ICC Champions Trophy, weve got some big one-dayers back in India, then were heading towards the 2011 World Cup, he said.         
	Its an important stage in his career to see firstly how his body is and obviously get some form under his belt.           (PTI)

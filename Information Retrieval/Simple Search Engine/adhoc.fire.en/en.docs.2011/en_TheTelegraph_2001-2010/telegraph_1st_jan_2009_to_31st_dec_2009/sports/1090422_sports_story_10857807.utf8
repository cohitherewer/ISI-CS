The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pietersen warned for on-field dissent 
                                                   Pietersen warned for on-field dissent 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Kevin Pietersen, the Royal Challengers Bangalore captain, was let off with a severe warning by Match Referee G.R. Viswanath for showing dissent over the umpires decision during their match against the Chennai Super Kings on Monday. The Royal Challengers lost the match by 92 runs.         
	Pietersen objected his first-ball leg before dismissal off the bowling of Muttiah Muralidharan and was reported by umpire Simon Taufel.         
	The offence, as per the Indian Premier Leagues code of conduct, is a level 1 offence, and the ex-England captain was warned post a hearing conducted by the Match Referee with the player.Pietersen, thus, became the first player in the second edition of the IPL to have been found at the wrong side of the Code of Conduct.         
	The IPL has adopted the MCCs Spirit of Cricket doctrine and will ensure that the cricketers follow the values of the same in letter and in spirit.Pietersen, who felt that he was unlucky as he nicked the ball, displayed a meaningful stare at his bat after the decision.         
	I think I got a little nick on it, but such is life, Pietersen was quoted as saying by a newspaper.         
	However, Muralidharan differed from Pietersens views. I didnt think he edged it and nor did Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Thats why we appealed. Its up to the umpire to make the decision, he said.         
	Meanwhile, chairman and commissioner Lalit Modi said every incident was taken seriously by the IPL.

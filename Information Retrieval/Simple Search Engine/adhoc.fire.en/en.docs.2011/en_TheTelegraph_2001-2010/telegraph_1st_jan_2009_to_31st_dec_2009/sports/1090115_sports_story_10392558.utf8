The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Somdev a step up in qualifiers
                                                   Somdev a step up in qualifiers
                      
	Melbourne: Somdev Dev Varman moved one step ahead in his quest for making the main draw of the Australian Open, overcoming a fighting Prakash Amritraj in the first round of the qualifying event here on Wednesday.         
	Somdev, seeded 28 in the qualifiers, tamed his unseeded compatriot 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 in the opening round. He will have to win two more matches to reach the main draw.         
	The 154th ranked Indian will take on 207th ranked Lukasz Kubot of Poland in the second round.         
	Kubot beat Edouard Roger-Vasselin of France 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 in their first round match.         
	It was a very well played match. Prakash played a great second set and fought well throughout the entire match. The third set was really close and the match came down to a couple of points. I am glad I got through this match, he said after the match.         
	Somdev, though, acknowledged that the road ahead would get only tougher.         
	I play a very good player in Kubot in my next match on Friday. I have to play well to beat him, he said.         
	Somdev broke Amritraj twice in the match and dropped his serve once.         
	Indias 196th ranked Sunitha Rao will open her womens singles qualifying campaign on Thursday against Melanie Oudin of the US, who is ranked 173 in the WTA list.         
	Somdev has been in scintillating form of late. He made history last week when he became the first Indian to reach the singles final of Chennai Open, the oldest ATP tournament of the country.         
	Although the 23-year-old lost the final to Croatian Marin Cilic, his performance earned him a lot of praise.           (AGENCIES)

    - Djokovic ousts world No. 2                           
	Miami: Sania Mirza and Chia-Jung Chuang of China bowed out in straight sets to third seeds Lisa Raymond of the US and her Czech partner Kveta Peschke in the womens doubles semi-finals of the $4.5m Miami Masters here.         
	The unseeded Indo-Chinese duo lost 6-7 (5-7), 4-6 making way for Raymond and Peschke to enter the final of the prestigious hard court event here on Friday.               
	Victoria Azarenka, the 19-year-old from Belarus, beat world No. 1 Serena Williams 6-3, 6-1 in the final on Saturday.               
	Sania and Chuang matched their higher-ranked opponent game by game in the opening set and stretched the affair into the tie-breaker but they were soon overpowered by the US-Czech pair.         
	Sania and Chuang ran out of steam in the second set and put up just a feeble resistance as their opponents easily sealed the match.         
	Raymond and Peschke will meet wild cards Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia and Amelie Mauresmo of France, who reached the final after defeating Patty Schnyder of Switzerland and Anna-Lena Groenefeld of Germany 7-6 (9-6), 6-3 in another last match.         
	In mens event, an out-of-sorts Roger Federer smashed his racket in frustration as he fell to a 6-3, 2-6, 3-6 defeat to Serbias Novak Djokovic in the semi-final (as reported in Saturdays Late City edition).         
	Djokovic will face Andy Murray in Sundays final after the Briton notched a 6-1, 5-7, 6-2 victory over Argentine Juan Martin Del Potro.         
	After winning the first set comfortably against an error-prone Djokovic in just 25 minutes, Federer faded badly in the second.         
	In windy conditions, he won just 57 percent of first-serve points in the second set and it got worse in the third as Djokovic broke at the first attempt.         
	Down 30-0 in the third game of the final set, Federer played a forehand long and responded by hurling his racket to the ground, totally mangling it and drawing jeers from the crowd.         
	Four years ago at the same venue, Federer was down two sets to Nadal when he smashed his racket and then came back to win in a five-set thriller in the final.         
	Although Federer got the crowd going and won two games in a row from 4-0 down, Djokovic kept his cool to secure just his third win in 10 attempts against Federer.         
	Federer thought the conditions contributed to his defeat.         
	I thought I was playing okay in the first set but it was always going to be tough in the wind, he said.         
	I already felt it in the warm up. It was coming across the court. I struggled heavily. It was tough, he said.           (AGENCIES)

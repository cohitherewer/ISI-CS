The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AIFF to announce campers list today 
                                                   AIFF to announce campers list today 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The much-awaited list of campers for the national team will be released on Tuesday, according to the All India Football Federation (AIFF) general secretary Alberto Colaco.         
	The top I-League clubs had been demanding to know the names of the players to be called for national duty after the AIFF announced its plans to hold a series of camps for the senior team throughout the season to prepare for the 2011 Asia Cup.         
	So much so, that some of the clubs, including East Bengal and Dempo, said they would not release the players for a longer period as it would hamper their interest.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph, Colaco said he would release the names of the players on Tuesday. National coach Bob Houghton has already made the list. Tomorrow (Tuesday) I will send it to the clubs and the concerned state associations.         
	The federation, however, will not accede to the request of some of the clubs that no fresh player outside the list should be called for the camp in future. If a new player excels in the next season, the federation has the right to try him out for the national team, Colaco said.         
	All the national team players, according to Colaco, will be able to play for their respective clubs in important tournaments like the I-League and the Federation Cup. As per the AIFF calendar, the first phase of the camp that begins on June 25, will be over after the Nehru Cup on August 31. The next camp will only begin on November 15.         
	Two knock out tournaments  IFA Shield and Durand Cup  will be played in September, followed by the first phase of the I-League. The players then will be free to play for their clubs, Colaco said.

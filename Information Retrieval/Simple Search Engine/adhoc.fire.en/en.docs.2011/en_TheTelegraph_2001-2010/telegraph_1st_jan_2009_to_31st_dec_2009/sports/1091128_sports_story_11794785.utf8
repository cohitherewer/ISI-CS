	Calcutta: Tollygunge Agragami taught a bitter soccer lesson to East Bengal Friday, beating them 2-1 in their CFL Premier Division match at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	Salau Nuruddin Olawale scored a brace as a disciplined Tollygunge outsmarted the red and gold brigade to bag full points. Harmanjot Singh Khabra scored the consolation goal for the city giants.         
	Tollygunge, on the defensive in the initial ten minutes, gradually started making forays into the East Bengal defence.         
	East Bengal custodian Avijit Ghosh was clueless and never looked like being in the match unlike his Tollygunge counterpart, Nasibul Haque, who made some brilliant saves.         
	In the sixth minute of the match, Nasibul showed his skills in keeping a well-directed effort C. Malsawmkima outside.         
	Nuruddin drew first blood in the 15th minute.         
	It was actually a long-ranger from Shanku Guha. A casual Wasim Feroz failed to clear it only to witness an opportunist Nuruddin to slot home with a precise left-footer that left East Bengal and a handful of their supporters stunned.         
	East Bengal tried to regroup and 20 minutes later they came close to restoring parity.         
	Abel Hammond placed it past an advancing Tollygunge goalie but the shot rebounded off the far post and fell for an unmarked Budiram Tudu.         
	All Budiram had to do was to put the ball into the open net but he wasted a couple of seconds before producing a half-hearted shot that was saved by the keeper.         
	However, eight minutes later, Khabra, grabbing a feeble Tollygunge clearance, unleashed a fiery left-footer for the equaliser.         
	However, things changed dramatically after the break. De Ridders boys were seen busy defending rather than going for the kill.         
	Wasim Feroz and Uga Okpara lacked co-ordination and Mehtab Hossain, in the mid-field, was the only one to try something different.         
	Nine minutes from time, Nuruddin netted the second. Chesting down a long ball, the Nigerian dribbled past Uga Okpara for his second.

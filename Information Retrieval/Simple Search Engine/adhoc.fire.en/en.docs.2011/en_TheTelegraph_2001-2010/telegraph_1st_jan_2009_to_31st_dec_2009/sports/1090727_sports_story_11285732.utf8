            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Shuttler Shruti Kurian feels it is her fitness and not the chemistry of the nascent partnership with Aparna Balan that needs working on as she prepares for the badminton World Championships to be held in Hyderabad next month.         
	Ours is a new combination. We are gelling well, but right now I think we are not fit enough to take on the best players, Kurian told The Telegraph from Melbourne on Sunday.         
	Kurian and Balan, who came together only recently after the former parted ways with Jwala Gutta, reached their second final, the first at the Grand Prix level, in as many months at the Australian Open.         
	As at Mays Spanish Open, the Indian duo once again fell at the last hurdle, losing 13-21, 9-21 to home favourites Chia Chi Huang and He Tian Tang.         
	Kurian, however, was undeterred by the loss.         
	This is the fourth tournament together for us. In the Sudirman Cup we won three out of four matches. We are settling down. We have started playing well at this level, now we have to step up to the next level, she said.

                                                     Dougherty wins, Shiv ends 8th
                  Goosen                     
	Munich: Britains Nick Dougherty held off a rampaging Rafa Echenique of Argentina to win the BMW International Open title on Sunday, his third on the European Tour.         
	Dougherty produced a blistering finale, an eight-under-par 64 for a 22-under-par 266 four-round total. That left him a stroke better than Echenique, whose albatross on 18 saw him home in 27 strokes for a magnificent 62.         
	A huge crowd had turned up in hope of seeing their home favourite, 51-year-old Bernhard Langer, become the oldest winner on the European Tour.         
	But they were disappointed, as was the leader for the first three rounds, South African double US Open champion Retief Goosen (71), who had to settle for third place, four behind Dougherty on 270. Langer slipped to 273 after a closing 72.         
	Indias Shiv Kapur finished eighth on 272.         
	Starting the day three strokes behind Goosen, Dougherty quickly caught up with three opening birdies. When Goosen bogeyed the fourth Dougherty led on his own.         
	While Goosens eagle on the ninth briefly put him level with Dougherty, the 27-year-old Englishman took control by picking up four shots in six holes after the turn.         
	With Goosen faltering and Langer unable to find his best form, Echenique, rifling in a three-iron approach from 243 yards on the final hole, put Dougherty under pressure in the end.         
	Ive had a few chances to win and things have gone against me but by the 15th I told myself this is my time, the winner said. Then I looked at the scoreboard and realised what Rafa had done and thought oh my goodness. I was delighted to get the job done but all credit to him. Ten-under-par is some score.

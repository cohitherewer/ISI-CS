The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mendis always in reckoning: Sangakkara
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mendis always in reckoning: Sangakkara
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Kanpur: There was relief for Kumar Sangakkara Monday when trusted lieutenant Tillekaratne Dilshan was declared fit for the second Test. But Damika Prasads absence definitely would be a cause for concern.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On injuries to Dilshan, Prasad         
	Dilshan is fit and will be playing tomorrow. As far as Damika is concerned, he is improving gradually but I dont think he will be fit by tomorrow morning.         
	Dilhara Fernando being a possible replacement...         
	Dilhara has been bowling well and has a good chance of playing tomorrow.         
	Whether Mendis could be drafted in         
	A bowler like Ajantha (Mendis) will always be in the reckoning. Although we havent decided on the final XI, we may think about the option of playing three spinners as all three  (Muttiah) Muralidharan, Mendis and (Rangana) Herath are top class bowlers.         
	Over-dependence on Murali         
	There is no denying that we are dependent on Murali. And he delivers more often than not. One always depends on the legends to deliver.         
	The camaraderie in the team         
	We have got a bunch of extremely talented and hard working boys who are always striving to raise standards. Each and every player in this team has been told to write down his individual goals. After a series, we try and assess how much we have been able to achieve.

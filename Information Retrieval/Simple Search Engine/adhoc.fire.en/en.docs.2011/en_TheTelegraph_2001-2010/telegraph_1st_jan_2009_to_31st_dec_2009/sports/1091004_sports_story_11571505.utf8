The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jyoti slips to tied 33rd
                                                   Jyoti slips to tied 33rd
                      
	St Andrews: Jyoti Randhawa turned in an even-par 72 to slip to the tied 33rd spot while Shiv Kapur continued to struggle, carding a 74 to be tied 142nd after the second round of Alfred Dunhill Links golf championship here.         
	Randhawa, overnight tied fourth with an opening round of 67, sank in three birdies and an equal number of bogeys in the second round to total five-under 139. Kapur, on the other hand, is unlikely to make the cut, with a total of three-over 147 so far.         
	Meanwhile, Arjun Atwal rode on a brilliant back-nine to card a three-under 69 and surge to the tied 31st spot but Jeev Milkha Singh slipped to tied 51st with a modest 72 in the second round of the Turning Stone Resort golf Championship here.

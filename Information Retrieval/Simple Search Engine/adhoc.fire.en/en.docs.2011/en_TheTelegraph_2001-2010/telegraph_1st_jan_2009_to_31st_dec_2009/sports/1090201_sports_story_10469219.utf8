The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I lost my cool, admits Dhoni
                                                     I lost my cool, admits Dhoni
                  Dhoni                     
	Colombo: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni Saturday said he lost his cool when his bowlers got confused and did not know what to do during the Powerplays in the second one-dayer against Sri Lanka here.         
	I lost my cool, especially when bowlers got confused with the Powerplays. I was not myself, especially in the second Powerplay, Dhoni said after his sides 15-run victory that saw them go 2-0 up in the five-match series.         
	Dhoni said he did not feel the job done yet, despite his teams 2-0 lead.         
	It was tough and we did not have such a game for a long time. We have to be careful as such wins often make us relaxed a bit. We should remember that the series is yet to be won. We want to win the series and for that each of us has to give 100 per cent, Dhoni said.         
	He said the team would have to make improvements in some departments to win the series.         
	Todays game was a tough one during which we committed some mistakes which we would like to rectify before going for the next match, he said.         
	We had couple of run outs. Besides, the bowlers should maintain line and length in the slog overs, he added.         
	The hosts captain Mahela Jayawardene conceded that India played better and were deserving winners.         
	They (Indians) played better cricket today. It was a good game. They deserved to win. We have also some positives to take. We fought back well.         
	It was a bit too much for Kandamby to finish the match. Myself and Kapugedera should have been there, he said.         
	During Indias innings we gave way too many runs when we were in control. We have to minimise mistakes and raise our game in the remaining matches, Jayawardene added.

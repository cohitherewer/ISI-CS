The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shock loss for Real
                                                   Shock loss for Real
                      
	Madrid: Real Madrid suffered an astonishing 4-0 defeat at third-tier side Alcorcon in the Kings Cup on Tuesday, humiliated in the first leg by a club with a budget more than 400 times smaller than the La Liga giants.         
	Real were missing their two most expensive signings, Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka, as well as several other key players, but were undone by a club with a $1.6 million annual budget compared to Reals 420 million. It was the third defeat in five matches for Manuel Pellegrinis side and piled more pressure on the Chilean coach after Saturdays 0-0 draw at Sporting Gijon and last weeks 3-2 home defeat to AC Milan in the Champions League.         
	Its an embarrassment, I have no explanation. When you lose like that there is not much to say. Sometimes in the Cup you think that your weaker opponent is easily beaten and until you lose you dont take them seriously, Pellegrini said._Pressed about his future, he added: I have never thought about, I am not thinking about, and I will not think about, resigning.

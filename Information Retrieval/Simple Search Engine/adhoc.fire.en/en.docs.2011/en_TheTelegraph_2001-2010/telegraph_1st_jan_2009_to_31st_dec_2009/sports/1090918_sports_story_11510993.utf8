	Calcutta: Indian archers swept all the top places in the ranking round of the fourth Asian Grand Prix archery tournament at the SAI, Eastern Centre, on Thursday.         
	Olympian Mangal Singh Champia topped the mens recurve event with a score of 679 points out of 720. Rahul Banerjee was second with 678 while Tarundeep Rai, competing as an individual entry, occupied the third spot relegating Jayanta Talukdar to the fourth position.         
	Young Rimil Buriuly was the best among the recurve women with a score of 651 points. She was followed by two individual entries  V. Pranitha (649) and Laxmi Rani Majhi (638). Two other Indian team members, Dola Banerjee (634) and Reena Kumari (626), were fourth and fifth, respectively.         
	Archers shot 36 arrows twice over 70m distance in the ranking round.         
	We had a good round today Its nice that we have managed to put behind the disappointing show in the World Championships, said Champia.         
	The Indians domination in the compound event was complete too. Kh. Ratan Singh, out of the Indian team for this meet after a dismal performance at the 45th World Championship in Ulsan, showed his capabilities by ranking first in the mens compound event with a score of 694.         
	He was followed by two Indian team members  Chungda Sherpa (689) and C. Srither (688).         
	Reza Zamaninejad of Iran was placed fifth with a score of 684.         
	Indias top ranked women compound archer, Jhano Hansdah, ruled the roost with a total of 688. The other two Indian team members, Namita Yadav (676) and Manjudha Soy (664) were behind her.         
	Meanwhile, for the first time, Indian archers will participate in an indoor competition when they take part in the 3rd Asian Indoor Games to be held in Hanoi (Vietnam) from October 30-November 8.

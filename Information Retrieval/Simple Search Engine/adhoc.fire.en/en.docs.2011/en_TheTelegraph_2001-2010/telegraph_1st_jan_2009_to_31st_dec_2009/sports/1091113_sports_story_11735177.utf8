The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan face ground realities
                                                                                                                                   Bagan face ground realities
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The weather has relented in Pune and the decks are cleared for Mohun Bagans crucial I-League match against Pune FC on Friday.         
	Bagan havent been in great nick with a loss and a draw in their last two matches. Still coach Karim Bencharifa would have nothing but victory in mind.         
	But Pune FC are no pushovers and Bencharifa knows that.         
	They havent won a single match but they havent lost either. It will be a difficult match. The condition of the ground also did not look good after the heavy downpour of the last two days, he said.         
	Bagan may go with a single striker and a five-man midfield. If that happens Edeh Chidi will be the lone man upfront with James Singh, Tomba Singh, Marcos, Manish Mathani and Snehasish Chakraborty manning the centre.         
	The defending in the I-League has been pathetic so far but Shilton Pauls return to form under the bar should give Bencharifa a reason to simile.

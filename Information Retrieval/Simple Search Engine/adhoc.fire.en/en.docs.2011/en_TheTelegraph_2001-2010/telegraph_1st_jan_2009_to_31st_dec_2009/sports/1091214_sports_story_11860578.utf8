                                                                                                                       7                                        Arindam: Indebted to Bob
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Arindam Bhattacharya                           
	New Delhi: A thought might have crossed Arindam Bhattacharyas mind when he stood under the bar during tie-breaker on Sunday. What Subrata Paul can do well, I can do even better.         
	The gutsy India U-23 goalkeeper was hardly affected by nerves as he pulled off couple of spectacular saves which will even make his senior colleague Subrata (he saved three penalties vs Syria during last Nehru Cup final) proud.         
	I had full faith in my abilities and didnt feel any pressure, Arindam said when contacted in Dhaka.         
	Ive had a good tournament in Dhaka and was confident of pulling it off in the shootout.         
	One reason for that could be the under-23 goalkeepers experience of having been in a similar situation before  he also saved two penalties for Churchill Brothers in the Durand Cup.         
	It was a rare chance for Arindam and he wanted to make it count.         
	I was extra determined to do well in this tournament...         
	I wasnt getting a chance to play for the senior national team as we have a fantastic goalkeeper in Subrata Paul.         
	The desperation to prove myself was very much there, he added.         
	Arindam also expressed his gratitude for U-23 coach Sukhwinder Singh and national coach Bob Houghton for showing faith in him.         
	I am happy that I have been able to live up to their expectations, he further added.         
	But the youngster refused to term the final as his best match ever.         
	I wouldnt say this was the best match of my career. That is yet to come, said the man who like Subrata Paul also hails from the small town of Sodepur.

                                                     Ponting has taken the right decision, says Buchanan
    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  KOLKATA KNIGHT RIDERS CRICKET MANAGER LOOKS AHEAD             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            John Buchanan                                 
	Calcutta: Ricky Ponting wont be coming... Ajantha Mendis is in hospital... Chris Gayle is again having fitness problems...         
	Its not great news for the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), but the IPL franchises Brisbane-based cricket manager, John Buchanan, hardly sounded perturbed during an interview with The Telegraph on Tuesday.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q The line-ups of the other teams have been known for some time now. Your thoughts on their strengths and weaknesses?         
	A Our analyst is on the job... Hes compiling a dossier on every player in every other franchise... Im not worried.         
	To talk of KKR, arent you disappointed that Ponting has chosen to make himself unavailable?         
	Given the amount of cricket Ricky and Australia face in the next 10 months and given the (captains) position that he occupies, I think hes taken the correct decision.         
	But havent your plans been upset?         
	No, Im happy with our squad of international players... Finalising our home-grown contingent over the next couple of weeks, preparing properly for 20-over cricket and not being distracted by things outside our control - for example, the threat of terrorism and the economic climate - will be the key to us competing successfully through the 2009 IPL.         
	Is the country-first bit a worry for the franchises?         
	No, I dont think so. The IPL have consistently said that the country must come first. However, at the same time, administrators around the world must provide adequate windows for the IPL and the Champions League so that the franchises and others can prepare their squads to the levels that they wish.         
	Youve mentioned terrorism. After Lahore, there was a report from Australia that KKRs coach, Matthew Mott, could review his coming to India. Have you spoken to him?         
	Like many others, Motty has concerns, but Ive spoken to him and I have no reason to believe he will not be coming.         
	What was your reaction when you heard of the attack on the Sri Lanka players, including KKRs Mendis?         
	Very distressed that anybody was attacked, not just a member of KKR... It was a sad day for everybody involved with cricket and the world itself... Im sure that attack has strengthened the resolve of the majority on our planet who abhor terrorist activities.         
	Mendis made the XI in only one match last year. Surely, its going to be very different in the IPLs second edition...         
	I expect Ajantha to impact significantly in at least 50 per cent of the games hes picked for.         
	Theres a question mark again over West Indies captain Gayle...         
	Im awaiting a medical feedback... Wouldnt like to comment till I get it.         
	Brendon McCullums form in the T20 Internationals against India must have delighted you. Did you follow the two matches?         
	Not too closely, but I was interested in Brendon and Ishant (Sharma).         
	What makes McCullum such a hot property in T20?         
	Brendon has the ability to quickly move his game from playing technically correctly to being innovative and taking high risks, and back again, if needed. As he learns how to be more consistent, well get to see some exceptional performances.         
	Your take on form...         
	Form is transient, skill and the knowledge of ones game is permanent.         
	For one reason or the other, there have been new international signings. Your views on the KKR rookies (in random order)?         
	 MASHRAFE MORTAZA (Bangladesh, all-rounder):Umar Guls non-availability has been a big loss for us and, so, well be looking to Mortaza to utilise his undoubted talent as a frontline bowler and a late-order hitter.         
	 ANGELO MATTHEWS (Sri Lanka, all-rounder): May not see much game-time this year, but is a player with huge potential.         
	 MOISES HENRIQUES (Australia, all-rounder): Similar to Matthews, but has the capcity to be the frontline bowler.         
	 MORNE van WYK (South Africa, wicket-keeper-batsman): Rickys replacement... Comes with a very good T20 record at home, but may not get much game-time.         
	[According to the IPL rules, only four overseas players can be fielded in the XI.]         
	The final one: When are you returning to Calcutta?         
	Between March 20-22.

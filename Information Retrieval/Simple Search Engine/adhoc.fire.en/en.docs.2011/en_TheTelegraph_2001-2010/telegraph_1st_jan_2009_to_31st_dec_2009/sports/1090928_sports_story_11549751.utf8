                                                     NZ keep semi-final hopes alive
                  Daniel Vettori and Daryl Tuffey celebrate the win over Sri Lanka, in Johannesburg, on Sunday                     
	Johannesburg: Riding a splendid all round show, New Zealand saw off Sri Lanka by 38 runs in a high scoring Group B match to keep their semi-final chances alive in the Champions Trophy here today.         
	New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori shone with both bat and ball in his teams victory as he first contributed an invaluable 48 and then took two crucial wickets.         
	Invited to bat, New Zealand overcame a mid-innings collapse to post a challenging 315 for seven and then bundled out Sri Lanka for 277 in 46.4 overs at the New Wanderers Stadium.         
	Sri Lanka have completed their league engagement with one win and two defeats but they still can make the semi-final grade as all four teams are still in contention in Group B.         
	Result of the other clashes will decide which team qualifies for the next stage and net run-rate will surely have a major say in deciding that.         
	Jesse Ryder (74) and Brendon McCullum (46) gave their side a solid start and then Martin Guptill (66) and Vettori, with their fiery knocks down the order, pushed Kiwis to an impressive 300-plus score.         
	Sri Lanka were off to a flying start with Tillekaratne Dilshan (41) and Sanath Jayasuriya (24) going berserk but lack of partnerships after their dismissal cost them dear.         
	Kyle Mills was expensive but emerged the highest wicket taker for Black Caps with his 10-0-69-3 figures. Daryl Tuffey (2/39) and James Franklin (2/40) took two wickets each.         
	Jayawardene (77), who was dropped on nought, was the top scorer for Sri Lanka.         
	Nuwan Kulasekara hit a fighting unbeaten 57 at No. 8 but that was not enough to save Sri Lanka from defeat.         
	At the start, Mills and Shane Bond (0/82) were at the receiving end when Dilshan and Jayasuriya were at the crease.         
	Tuffey brought relief for his team when he saw the back of Jayasuriya and Mills got rid of Dilshan six balls later.         
	Both Sangakkara (11) and Jayawardene got lives when they had not even opened their accounts but the skipper could not make most of that dropped chance off Mills.         
	Jayawardene though cashed in on and kept his team in the hunt with his sedate 85-ball knock, which featured six fours and two sixes.         
	However the former captain did not get a good partner as Thilan Samaraweera (17) and Thilina Kandambi (11) squandered good starts.         
	Kiwi skipper Vettori sent back Samaraweera not letting a partnership flourish between him and Jayawardene, leaving Lankans at 137 for five.         
	Angelo Mathews (2) also returned in hurry but Kulasekara raised hopes when he stuck to the crease and rattled up an unlikely 78 runs with Jayawardene for the seventh wicket.         
	Vettori broke the stand when he castled Jayawardene and the task was quite enormous for Sri Lankan lower order to score the required runs. (PTI)

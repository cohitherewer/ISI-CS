The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AI want to play final tie at home
                                                   AI want to play final tie at home
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Relegation-threatened Air India on Friday demanded that their final I-League match against Sporting Clube de Goa be played at home as originally scheduled.         
	Yes, we have written to the Western India Football Association (WIFA). Our last game is a home match and we want to play at home only, Air India coach Bimal Ghosh said.         
	The AIFF earlier this week decided to shift the Air India-Sporting tie on April 16 from Mumbai to Gurgaon as it was clashing with elections in Maharashtra. It also decided that Mahindra Uniteds tie against Mohun Bagan on the same day would be played in Delhi.         
	While Mahindra have not expressed concerns in playing Bagan at a neutral venue, Air India are keen to retain the home advantage as they are not completely out of the relegation zone.

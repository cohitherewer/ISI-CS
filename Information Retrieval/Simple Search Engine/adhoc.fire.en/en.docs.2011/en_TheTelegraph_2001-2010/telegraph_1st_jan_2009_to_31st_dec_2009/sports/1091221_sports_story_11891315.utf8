                                                                                                                       7                                        Bagan eye a winning start 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT             Barreto                           
	Guwahati: Defending champions Mohun Bagan take on Mohammedan Sporting in the opening match of Federation Cup at the Nehru Stadium, here on Monday.         
	The black and white brigade is hoping that Theodore Sundays return will give them the much-needed boost. Along with Eduardo Escobar, Sunday will prove quite a handful for the Bagan defence.         
	The ground has been a lucky ground for Sunday who scored a few goals for Mohammedan Sporting during last years second division league.         
	This is a tough group and we seem to be the weakest as far as the profile is concerned.         
	However, I am confident that our boys will put up a great fight, Sporting coach Shabbir Ali said.         
	Shabbir predicted Mondays match to be a tough one. We will have to play really well to beat them, he added.         
	Mohun Bagan will be banking on their foreign power to see them through on Monday. With talismanic Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto back in action, the green and maroon brigade will be hoping for a winning start.         
	They also have in-form striker Edeh Chidi and highly talented Asian quota player Ryuiji Sueoka. How the trio combine upfront remains to be seen.         
	We are confident but not complacent. Mohammedan Sporting are a good side and can create an upset. We have to be careful, Bagan coach Karim Bencharifa said.         
	Later, Chirag United will open their campaign against Mahindra United in a Group B match.         
	Placed third in the ongoing I-League, the Calcutta outfit will be no pushovers and Mahindra will have their task cut out.         
	It is anybodys tournament. All the sides are equally strong and it will be a battle of nerves in every game, said Chirag coach Subrata Bhattacharjee, after a practice session at the Nehru Stadium on Sunday.         
	Chirag will be banking on Brazilian striker Edmilson for goals as his countryman Joshimar has been ruled out of the tournament with injury.         
	Mahindra, on the other hand, will depend on Muritala Ali and Mohammed Rafi upfront while, in the midfield, Svetozmar Mijin, Steven Dias and NP Pradeep, will be the ones on whom coach David Booth will pin his hopes.         
	In Silchar, where Group A and C matches will be played, the spirit was more upbeat than in Guwahati.         
	In the first match of the day in Silchar, Churchill will meet qualifiers Hindustan Aeronauticals Ltd. (HAL) while Sporting Clube de Goa will lock horns with Mumbai FC in second encounter in the evening.  
	Fed Cup over the years  Mohun Bagan have won the title most number of times mdash; 13   Mohun Bagan won the cup thrice in a row on two occasions mdash; (1980-82) and (1992-94)  Despite reaching the finals 12 times, East Bengal have won the title just five times, twice jointly with Mohun Bagan   Mahindra United became the third team (after Mohun Bagan and Dempo) to win the Federation Cup-NFL double in a season (2005-2006) Mohun Bagan achieved the feat in 2001-02 and Dempo in 2004-05.  Jamsed Nassiri holds the unique distinction of scoring goals in three consecutive finals-1983,1984 (for Mohammedan Sporting) and 1985 (for East Bengal).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhutia row drags on 
                                                   Bhutia row drags on 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The deadlock in the Bhaichung Bhutia-Mohun Bagan row continued after the warring parties failed to settle the matter amicably on Tuesday.         
	The All India Football Federation (AIFF)-appointed arbitrator, Amarendra Sharan, who heard both sides the third time this month, has asked Bhaichung and Bagan to return for another round of talks at 4.30pm on Wednesday.         
	Attempts made to solve the matter amicably have failed, Sharan admitted. The arbitration has begun. I will announce my verdict in due course.         
	The arbitrator added he would consider Bhaichungs plea for interim relief, so that he can play club football while the decision is pending, on Wednesday.         
	The arguments on conciliatory proceedings are over. I have reserved the judgement and the plea for interim relief will be taken up tomorrow, Sharan said.         
	Sources said the arbitrator appeared committed to finding an amicable solution but that neither side was willing to yield even an inch. So much so that Bhaichung, who attended the meeting, walked off after telling the arbitrator that under no circumstances would he play for Bagan again.         
	The ace striker said that since Bagan have raised questions about his integrity, it would not be right for him to don the green and maroon jersey again.         
	Bhaichung was in no mood to meet the Bagan officials, said a source. He wanted none of them to raise questions about his commitment to the game.         
	Sources in the AIFF said that Bagan officials were trying to question the validity of the entire process.         
	They seem not too keen to continue the process, sources revealed. Now they want to prove that the AIFF was wrong in appointing an arbitrator without going through the process of referring the matter to the Players Status Committee and the Appeals Committee of the federation, the official said.         
	Bhaichung, who was suspended by Bagan for six months for not showing up at practice sessions and an exhibition match in Jalpaiguri, has been pleading for justice for more than three months now. The issue was further complicated when Bhaichung signed for East Bengal and asked Bagan for a release.         
	Bagan officials claimed the Indian captain had an agreement with their club till end of the 2009-2010 season and refused to release the Sikkimese striker.         
	Considered an icon of Indian football, Bhaichung initially wrote to IFA and then to AIFF to resolve the matter but neither of the two could offer a solution.         
	The AIFF general secretary, Alberto Colaco, who was authorised by the emergency committee of the federation to break the stalemate, also failed to find a solution after holding a series of meetings with both parties.

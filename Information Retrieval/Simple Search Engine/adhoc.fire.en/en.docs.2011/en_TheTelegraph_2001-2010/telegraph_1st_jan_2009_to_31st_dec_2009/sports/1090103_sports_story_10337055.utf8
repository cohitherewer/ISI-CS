The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania faces an uphill journey
                                                     Sania faces an uphill journey
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Sania Mirza                           
	Mumbai: Sania Mirza is cautiously optimistic about 2009 as she begins her long journey towards regaining the lost glory on the tennis arena.         
	The Indian star will be playing her fifth straight Australian Open, starting January 11, but faces the prospect of going into the years first Grand Slam without having played a competitive tournament following a four-month injury layoff.         
	Being ranked No.101  thanks to a wrist surgery that kept her out of court for the most part of 2008  means that Mirza wont get direct entries into top tier tournaments unless she is given a wild card.         
	A star-studded exhibition event in Hong Kong will be Mirzas first tournament since she lost in the first round at Beijing Olympics. The 22-year-old will be part of an Asia-Pacific team against European and American teams led by world No.1 Jelena Jankovic and reigning Wimbledon Champion Venus Williams, respectively.         
	The Hyderabad girl is looking for a wild card, courtesy the Hobart event (from January 11) where she reached the quarter finals last year. In case she doesnt get one, the Pattaya Open in Thailand in February would be her first WTA event.         
	What this means is that Mirza has 120 points to defend  30 from Hobart and 90 from the Australian Open  and a bad outing in Melbourne could see her ranking plummet to 160.         
	The Australian Open will be more special because I am coming back from injury. It is the place where I played my first Grand Slam  but I am living in the moment, Mirza told The Telegraph.         
	I dont want to get ahead of myself. I dont know whats going to happen two weeks from now or thereafter. I am taking it day by day, she said.         
	Besides the climb back into the top-30, where she was at the end of 2007, winning her second title  she won her first in 2005 in Hyderabad  could be another motivating factor.         
	You will be surprised to know that not many in the top-100 have won a title in their entire career. I am lucky I won mine at a very early stage and have come close to winning the second, she said.         
	It is a motivating factor but it is not a realistic target for now. There is a huge difference between being fit and match fit. Its not some magic, cannot be done overnight.         
	Mirza was disappointed that the two womens tournaments in the country, the Bangalore Open and Sunfeast Open, have gone off the WTA calendar.         
	Its disheartening. They gave the people and the players of this country an opportunity to see what the level is. It is unfortunate but people (involved with the tournaments) have their reasons.         
	The Fed Cup, which follows immediately after The Australian Open, in Perth poses another challenge for Mirza. The governments recent ruling that only Indian citizens can represent India in sports has made Shikha Uberoi and Sunitha Rao ineligible for the womens team event.         
	It is the governments decision. As long as I am selected, I will give my best regardless of who is going to play with me, she said.

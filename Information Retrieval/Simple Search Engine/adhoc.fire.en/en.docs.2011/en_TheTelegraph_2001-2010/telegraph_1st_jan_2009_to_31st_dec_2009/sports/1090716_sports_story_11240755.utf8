                                                   Padraigs bold step to get into swing 
            [+uc('Brendan Gallagher   The Daily Telegraph')+]                      
	Rebuilding your golf swing is radical but not unprecedented for golfing greats. Nick Faldo undertook it to make the quantum leap from outstanding tour player to major winner, and Tiger Woods went back to the drawing board in 2000 so he could dominate the worlds biggest tournaments. For some sportsmen, being first among equals is nowhere near enough.         
	Padraig Harrington, to the puzzlement of many, including his wife Caroline, has been rebuilding his swing this year despite having won three majors in 2007 and 2008. He was even at it again on Tuesday in the sun and showers, deciding to break his wrists much earlier to change the plane of his swing.         
	Harrington was hitting the ball like a bullet in practice and was comfortably the most relaxed player on view, even if his followers were quietly having kittens.         
	Its a case of short-term sacrifice for long-term gain, admitted Harrington.         
	Harringtons urgent need to change what, for eight years, had appeared to be a winning formula is an extension of his compulsive personality.         
	The need to win and be the best is all-consuming, as is his attention to detail. It is what drives the finest competitors; the only thing strange is that some consider it odd.         
	Former England batsman Graham Gooch provoked great mirth and disquiet when he unveiled his stand and deliver stance in 1979 after an aunt taped the previous winters Ashes on her video recorder, which highlighted a litany of faults as Gooch wandered across his stumps at delivery time. But once he perfected his new technique he could not stop scoring runs and his England career was relaunched.         
	It took years of fine tuning before Jonathan Edwards, already competitive, finally mastered the triple jump, at which point he smashed the world record and became unbeatable.         
	One of the oldest truisms in sport is that if you stand still you effectively go backwards. That is totally unacceptable for Harrington, who has spent the majority of his golfing life towards the top of the leaderboard.

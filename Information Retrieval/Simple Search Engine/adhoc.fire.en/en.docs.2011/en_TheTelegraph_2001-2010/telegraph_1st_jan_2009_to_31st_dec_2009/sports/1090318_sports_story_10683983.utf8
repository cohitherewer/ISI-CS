The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indias final hopes fade
                                                   Indias final hopes fade
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Indian men had no problems in thrashing New Zealand 3-1 in the just-ended series, but Jhulan Goswami and Co. just couldnt put it across the New Zealand women.         
	On Tuesday at North Sydney Oval, in a crucial Super Six match of the ICC Womens World Cup, the Indians lost by five wickets making it difficult for them to progress to the final.         
	India batted first after winning the toss and despite opener Anjum Chopras 18th ODI half-century, managed only 207 in 49.4 overs. Anjum (52) fell soon after completing her half-century. Reema Malhotra contributed with an unbeaten 59.         
	Opener Kate Pulford led New Zealands chase with an 89-ball 71 .         
	After Tuesdays loss, India have two points from two matches.         
	India are ahead of New Zealand on net run-rate but can reach the final only if they beat West Indies in their final Super Six match and hope that New Zealand lose to Pakistan and Australia lose to England.         
	It is very difficult to motivate ourselves after losing such a crucial match, Jhulan said after the match.         
	England in final         
	The England womens team secured a place in the World Cup final by beating the West Indies by 146 runs on Tuesday.         
	BRIEF SCORES

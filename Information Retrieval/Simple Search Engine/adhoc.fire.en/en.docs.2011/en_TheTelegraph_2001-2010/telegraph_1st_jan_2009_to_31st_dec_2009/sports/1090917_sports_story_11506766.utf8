The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting adds to England woes 
                                                   Ponting adds to England woes 
                      
	Nottingham: Ricky Ponting piled on the misery for England with a masterful century to help Australia claim a comfortable four-wicket win and a 5-0 lead in the one-day series on Tuesday.         
	Captain Ponting thumped 126 in 109 balls as the visitors eased to their target of 300 with 10 deliveries to spare at Trent Bridge.         
	Australia, who again lost the toss, will now target a clean sweep in the sixth and seventh games in Nottingham on Thursday and in Durham on Sunday respectively.         
	Pontings side hit 302 for six, Mitchell Johnson clinching victory with a six over long-on from a full toss by seamer Ryan Sidebottom.         
	The win was set up by a well-paced third-wicket partnership of 133 between Man of the Match Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke (52).

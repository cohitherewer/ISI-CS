The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Flintoff praised
                                                   Flintoff praised
                      
	Durban: Andrew Flintoff, forced out of the IPL due to injury, was a good influence on the Chennai Super Kings, according to coach Stephen Fleming.         
	He (Flintoff) bowled very well for us in the second game. But AB de Villiers had his day. Flintoff has been a good influence as well. Its such a fine line between having a good day and a bad day, Fleming said.         
	We are not going to get carried away. Flintoff is one of the great all-round players certainly I have seen. So, no concerns there. (PTI)

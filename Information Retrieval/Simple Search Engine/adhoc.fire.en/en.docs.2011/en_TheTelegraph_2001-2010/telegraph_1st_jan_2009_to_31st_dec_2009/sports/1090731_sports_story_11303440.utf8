The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhullar, Lahiri at tied 11th
                                                   Bhullar, Lahiri at tied 11th
                      
	Bandar Seri Begawan (Brunei): Gaganjeet Bhullar fired a four-under 67 to join compatriot Anirban Lahiri at tied 11th in the $300,000 Brunei Open on Thursday.         
	Fresh from his triumph in the Indonesia President Invitation in Jakarta last week, Bhullar looked completely at home at the Empire Hotel and Country Club, barring that fifth hole bogey which was the lone blot in an otherwise impeccable card studded with five birdies.         
	Lahiri, a 10th tee starter, dropped two bogeys but more than compensated with four birdies and the spectacular 15th hole eagle. Seasoned campaigner Gaurav Ghei carded 68 to lie tied 19th, one shot ahead of compatriot C. Muniyappa who was tied 30th.         
	Baaz Mann (70) was at tied 51st while city pro Ranil Gangjee and Digvijay Singh managed identical 71s and the trio of Chirag Kumar, Himmat Rai and Manav Jaini carded matching 72s.

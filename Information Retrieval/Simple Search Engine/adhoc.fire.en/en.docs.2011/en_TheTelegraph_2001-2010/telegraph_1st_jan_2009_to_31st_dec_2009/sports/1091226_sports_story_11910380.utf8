	 Rashid Khan and Rahul Bajaj stayed on course for a final-round showdown with both players winning their quarter final ties at the LG Goodricke Eastern India Amateur Golf Championship that is being played at the par-72 Royal Calcutta Golf Club Friday.       
	Rashid won his tie against Karan Vasudeva 4 amp;2, while Rahul Bajaj defeated Pawan Kumar 4 amp;3.      
	In the clash between the Calcutta boys, Samaresh Sardar emerged victorious over Mohammed Sanjib to set up a semi-final clash against Rashid while Raja Sardar prevailed over SK Pappu to progress to the last-four stage.      
	Earlier in the day, Vasudeva, still seeking his maiden win on the LG Amateur Tour, dominated the early stages of the match against Rashid. The lower-ranked Vasudeva went 3Up after just eight holes and seemed in control of the tie close to the halfway stage.       
	But Vasudeva made three straight bogeys to bring the score back to all-square after 11 holes. Rashid made his first birdie of the day on the par-4 12th hole, but Vasudeva too made a birdie on the same hole and avoided losing further ground.       
	However, having found his opportunity after trailing through most of the match, Rashid birdied the difficult par-3 13th, to go ahead for the first time in the match.       
	Vasudeva made bogeys on the 14th and 15th, and was 3Down before Rashid closed the deal with a birdie on the 16th.          
	National Handball Academy (NHA) beat Karnataka by 32 goals to 25 to make it to the quarter finals of the 38th senior National handball championship Friday. Madhya Pradesh completed the last-eight line-up by defeating Assam 37-30.      
	The results ensured that both NHA and Madhya Pradesh will figure in the upper pool in the next Nationals while Karnataka and Assam, who had finished last in the upper pool groups, and figured in pre-quarterfinal play-off, will be relegated to the lower pool next year.      
	The other teams who have reached the quarter finals are West Bengal, Services and Delhi from group A and Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Haryana from group B.                
	 Royal Taj Tigers (Red) defeated Royal Taj Bengal (Navy Blue) 5-3 in the first exhibition match of the Taj Bengal Cup at the Pat Williamson Polo Grounds.       
	Fort William Riding amp; Polo Club defeated Calcutta Polo Club 11-5 to win the BFL Polo Masters in the Annual Polo Season in Calcutta.

                                                   India colts thrash Aussies by 7 wkts
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: After Team India and the Indian women, it was the turn of the Indian colts to thrash Australia.         
	Captain Ashok Menaria scored an unbeaten 63 as India Under-19 beat their Australian counterparts by seven wickets in the five-match limited-overs tournament opener at the Bellerive Oval Tuesday.         
	Electing to bat, the Australians were bowled out for 168 in 48 overs. Assam pacer Krishna Das took two wickets, while Manan Sharma was the pick of the Indian bowlers, taking three for 24 from his six overs of left-arm spin.         
	Joel Garrett top scored with 29 for the home team. Tom Beaton (22) and Nic Maddinson (26) got the innings off to a solid start with a 41-run opening partnership, but the Indians struck back.         
	The Indian bowlers kept the pressure on the Australian middle-order, restricting them with some disciplined bowling.         
	In reply, the visitors got off to a steady start, before Victorian speedster Jackson Coleman struck twice, snaring the wickets of Avi Barath (13) and Mukul Dagar (31). India finally reached the target with five overs to spare.         
	Captain Menaria led the charge with an unbeaten 63 from 91 deliveries which also earned him the Player of the Match award. He received good support from Harpreet Singh, who finished on 38 not out, as the pair guided the team home with an unbroken 79-run partnership.         
	Although disappointed with the opening loss, Coleman was confident the home side would come back strongly in the next match.         
	The second match will be played at Bellerive on Thursday.         
	Coleman could have had an extra wicket had he not bowled Barath on a free-hit delivery during the 14th over, but the quick was happy with his initial outing.

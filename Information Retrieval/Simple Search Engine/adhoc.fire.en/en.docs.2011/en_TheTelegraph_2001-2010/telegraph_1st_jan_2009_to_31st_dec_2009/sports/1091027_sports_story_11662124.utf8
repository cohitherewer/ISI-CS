The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saha is the dark horse
                                                   Saha is the dark horse
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Laxmi Ratan Shuklas captaincy appears to be under threat with major changes likely when the Bengal senior selection committee meets Tuesday to pick the squad for the Ranji Trophy.         
	In that case, wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman Saha, according to a Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) source, has a very good chance of becoming the new Bengal captain.         
	There can be a change in the captaincy Recent results have shown that there is something wrong within the team and, now, its high time to take certain measures, a top CAB official said.         
	Besides, team manager Robert Rozarios report about the lack of discipline in the Bengal team will come into play during the selection.         
	It was learnt that the CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya, who is extremely unhappy with the managers report on indiscipline, spoke separately to Deep Dasgupta, Shukla, Ranadeb Bose and Manoj Tiwary on Monday.         
	He (Dalmiya) is unhappy with the reports about the indiscipline in the team. He is personally looking into the matter and also handling the selection issue.         
	With pathetic performances in the JP Atray Memorial, Moin-ud-Dowla Gold Cup and, more recently, the just-concluded East Zone T20 meet in Dhanbad, Shuklas captaincy has come in for criticism.         
	We had given Laxmi ample time to prove himself with the team but there was no result So we want to see somebody else now Although options are few... I think Wriddhiman will be good, the official added.         
	However, sources close to Dalmiya revealed that the president does not want the promising Saha to be burdened with the captaincy.         
	Asked about Rohan Gavaskars chances of making the squad, the CAB official said that there was no point leaving the left-hander out when the middle-order looked far from promising. The 24-member probables will be pruned down to a squad of 15 players.         
	Meanwhile, coach Roger Binny, who is in Bangalore due to personal reasons, is likely to miss the meeting.         
	Binny, is scheduled to return tomorrow evening and, in that case, will miss the meeting. But the president wants him there So, I dont know, the meeting might also be deferred by a day. Lets see what happens, CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey said.         
	The president, it was learnt, will be present in the selection committee meeting.

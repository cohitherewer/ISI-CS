  - First Test 
  -  Sri Lankans already ahead by 165 runs; Indians avoid the media         INDRANIL MAJUMDAR            Sachin Tendulkar congratulates Mahela Jayawardene after his double century in Ahmedabad on Wednesday. (PTI)                                   
	Ahmedabad: Its a battle for survival for the Indians.         
	Mahela Jayawardenes monumental unbeaten 204 and an unbroken 216-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Prasanna Jayawardene grounded Mahendra Singh Dhonis men into the Motera dust on Wednesday.         
	At close on the third day of the opening Test, the visitors were ahead by 165 runs and eyeing their first victory on Indian soil.         
	For most part of the afternoon the Indians body language was one of despair. There was no attempt to make things happen as their drooping shoulders did little to enhance their reputation. They simply allowed things to drift inexplicably.         
	So pathetic was the Indian performance that no one showed the courage to face the media after the days play.         
	The players dismal attitude showed on the field  Dhoni cross-armed and searching for ideas, Gautam Gambhir sulking over a dropped catch, Harbhajan Singh adopting a more flatter line, Amit Mishra looking more like a club-level bowler. It was only Sachin Tendulkar who made some attempt to spruce up things.         
	The pacers, except for a brief session before lunch, failed to generate swing, conventional and reverse, while the spinners were wayward. Dhonis leadership should also come under the scanner for his lack of imagination in field placements.         
	The pitch, too, played its part. It remained a batting beauty with the slow nature almost negating the turn it offered. It is in these situations that you feel the absence of one Mr Anil Kumble. The propensity to bowl consistently from one end, the untiring efforts that helped to keep the teams morale high when the going got tough and the leadership he provided to the bowling were sorely missed.         
	Harbhajan, despite the years of experience he has had playing with Kumble, hasnt shown the maturity and tenacity to survive in such circumstances. If Harbhajan was a disappointment, Mishra once again struggled with his rhythm. At one point, the leg-spinner tried utilising the footmarks outside the leg stump but ended up with half volleys and full tosses.         
	There was no attempt to make use of the popping crease. Moreover, for most part of the day, Harbhajan was made to bowl with a deep point that defied all logic.         
	Harbhajan could do well to send a thank you note to umpire Daryl Harper after he had provided India with a glimmer of hope at the stroke of lunch. Angelo Mathews luck ran out when he was given caught at silly point after the ball had come off his pads.         
	Sri Lanka were 151 behind at the start and the opening session was set to decide the course of the game. Both Mahela and Thilan Samaraweera negotiated the slow turn with some intelligent use of their feet. Sensing very little hope, Dhoni didnt waste an opportunity to take the new ball.         
	Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharmas spells before lunch were the best of the innings. The senior pro almost left Samarweera clueless in the sixth over with the new ball beating him both in pace and movement. Then, a well-aimed bouncer narrowly missed his body.         
	Ishant got into the act with one that held its line and left Samarweera (70) rattled. The next one was short, and as he pulled, it was plucked from the air by an acrobatic Yuvraj. The 138-run partnership for the fourth wicket had finally been broken and the relief was palpable.         
	Mahela, though, ensured that the excitement was short-lived with three boundaries in one Zaheer over. The former captain batted with authority, consolidating in the initial stages and then accelerated with consummate ease. Quality control was the buzzword in his batting.         
	 This was his sixth double century and first century on Indian soil. It was, above all, a fine exhibition of his skill and temperament that took 480 minutes and included 17 fours, a five and a six.         
	Mahela reached his double century in the second last over of the day while Prasanna (84 batting) is set for what would be a chanceless hundred.         
	It would take loads of patience and concentration on the part of the Indians to bat through on what will be more than a days play.

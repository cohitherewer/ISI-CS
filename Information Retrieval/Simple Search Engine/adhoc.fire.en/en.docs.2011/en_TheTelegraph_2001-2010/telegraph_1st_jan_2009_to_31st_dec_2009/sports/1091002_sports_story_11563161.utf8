	London: Manchester United and Chelsea secured victories while Bayern Munich drew 0-0 at home with Juventus in the Champions League on Wednesday, as reported in Thursdays Late City edition.         
	However, seven-time European champion AC Milan suffered a stunning 1-0 home defeat by FC Zurich, piling the pressure on coach Leonardo.         
	There were no such problems for Real Madrid as they won, helped by two more goals from Cristiano Ronaldo,         
	Milan won at Olympique Marseille in their group opener but have had a tough time domestically under new manager Leonardo with goals very hard to come by.         
	It was the same story on Wednesday with a sparse San Siro crowd whistling derision at their sides blunt efforts.         
	Their big names were shown up by the clever mid-air backheel of unmarked Finnish centre back Hannu Tihinen which put Swiss side Zurich on the way to a famous victory after 10 minutes.         
	Both Milan and Zurich have three points and Real Madrid top Group C on six after two more goals from red-hot Ronaldo helped them to a 3-0 home victory over Marseille.         
	The Premier League leaders had to come from behind to beat VfL Wolfsburg 2-1 at Old Trafford.         
	Bosnian striker Edin Dzeko headed the lively German champions into the lead 10 minutes into the second half but 35-year-old Ryan Giggs levelled with a deflected free kick.         
	United, looking inventive around the box after a sluggish start clinched victory 12 minutes from time with a crisp shot by midfielder Michael Carrick.         
	United top Group B with six points. Wolfsburg have three, as do CSKA Moscow after their 2-1 home win over Besiktas.         
	Chelsea produced a repeat of their first group game as a solitary goal by Nicolas Anelka was enough to win 1-0 at APOEL Nicosia.         
	Porto bounced back well with a 2-0 home win over Atletico Madrid to leave the fancied Spaniards up against it with just a point after two games.         
	Bayern Munich missed an opportunity to take early command of Group A when they wasted a stack of chances in their goalless home draw with Juventus.

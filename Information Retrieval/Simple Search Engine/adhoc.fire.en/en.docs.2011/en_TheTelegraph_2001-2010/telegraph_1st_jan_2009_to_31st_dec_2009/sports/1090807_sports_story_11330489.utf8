The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhupathi out of doubles 
                                                   Bhupathi out of doubles 
                      
	Washington: Mahesh Bhupathi and his partner Mark Knowles, seeded third, crashed out of the ATP Washington Classic event after losing a tough quarter final match to Martin Damm and Robert Lindstedt on Wednesday.         
	The Indo-Bahamian pair made a good start by annexing the first set but their opponents counter attacked and took away the match 3-6, 6-1, 16-14 in one hour and 26 minutes.         
	Bhupathi and Knowles broke the Czech-Swedish combination once and saved a breakpoint to go one set up.         
	Meanwhile, in the singles event, top seed and three-time champion Andy Roddick cruised to a 6-3, 6-2 second round victory over Benjamin Becker in his first match since his five-set loss to Roger Federer at Wimbledon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Eto brace rescues Barcelona
                                                   Eto brace rescues Barcelona
                      
	Madrid: Samuel Eto scored two goals, including a late equaliser as leaders Barcelona rallied from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Real Betis and stretch their unbeaten run to 22 league games.         
	Betis were two goals up within 25 minutes through Juan Melli Andreu and Mark Gonzalez before Eto scored off the rebound from his saved penalty in the 45th for his 100th league goal for Barcelona Saturday.         
	The Cameroon strikers shot in the 84th minute needed a slight deflection to beat Betis keeper Ricardo Soares. He looked set to hand Barcelona their first loss since the opening day with the Portugal goalkeeper making several fine saves towards the end of the game, including a point-blank volley by Gerard Pique in the 82nd.         
	Barcelona saw a 10-game winning streak snapped, however, as they moved to 60 points after Eto took his league-leading goal tally to 23. Also Saturday, Osasuna held Deportivo La Coruna to a 0-0 draw at El Riazor Stadium.         
	In Seville, Barcelona could have been ahead in the sixth minute but Eto failed to control the ball alone in front of goal, with Xavi Hernandez eventually firing a hard shot wide.

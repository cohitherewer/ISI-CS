The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Knight in shining armour
                                                   Knight in shining armour
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: At $700,000, Brendon McCullum didnt come cheap for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPLs inaugural auction, last February.         
	He wasnt all that expensive either.         
	Owing to New Zealands commitments (versus England), though, McCullum wasnt available for much of the IPLs first season, but such problems wont arise this year.         
	The second edition begins on April 10 and will end on May 24.         
	Great news for the Shah Rukh Khan-owned team which failed to make at least the last-four stage.         
	Indeed, over the six weeks this time, it should be total paisa vasool for the Knight Riders. McCullum, in fact, will be returning to Calcutta as a bigger brand  thanks to the MoM awards in successive T20 Internationals against India.         
	With no Shoaib Akhtar (dumped by the Knight Riders) and no Ricky Ponting (who has made himself unavailable) either, McCullum is set to be the biggest draw after captain Sourav Ganguly.         
	Were absolutely delighted that McCullum will be around for all (minimum of 14) matches... His reputation as a match-winner has grown, somebody closely associated with the Knight Riders told The Telegraph on Friday evening.         
	The gentleman added: One recalls the fierce bidding for McCullum... In the overseas wicket-keepers category, he was one of the two (other being Adam Gilchrist) most sought after... I think he was the first keeper to be bought at that auction in Mumbai         
	There were good reasons for McCullum being in such demand and his blinder in the IPL opener (versus the Bangalore Royal Challengers), when he smashed an unbeaten 158 off as few as 73 balls, gave the tournament a start which even the most gifted of spin doctors wouldve struggled to script.         
	However, theres much more to McCullum than big-hitting and Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. need to learn from the professional way he anchored New Zealands chase in both T20 Internationals.         
	Whatever the form, more often than not, the result will be favourable if somebody at the very top of the order takes responsibility till the mission has been accomplished.         
	McCullum has quickly recognised 20 overs isnt that short an innings-span and the game isnt only about trying to clear the boundary. Basically that smart cricket is called for.         
	Its time a Virender Sehwag realised that too.         
	The first to get past 500 runs in T20 Internationals, 27-year-old McCullum (with fifties in each of his last four matches) now has 582 against his name.         
	Given that McCullum wears two hats, hell remain an asset and, in time, should begin making a bigger impact in Tests and ODIs.

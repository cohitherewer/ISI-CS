The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Super Kings look to get back on track
                                                     Super Kings look to get back on track
                  Mahendra Singh Dhoni                     
	Port Elizabeth: The Chennai Super Kings, stung by their two-wicket loss against the Royal Challengers Bangalore on Thursday, would hope to get their campaign back on track against the Mumbai Indians in a bid to advance to the semi-finals, in the Indian Premier League here on Saturday.         
	The Super Kings would look to take advantage of the Mumbai Indians weakness of buckling under pressure, as was evident on Thursday when the Sachin Tendulkar-led side fell short by only two runs against the Rajasthan Royals.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhonis men have collected 13 points from 11 matches while the Mumbai side have a tough task on their hands having garnered 11 points from their 12 appearances in the tournament so far.         
	The Super Kings, who lost to the Mumbai side in the tournament opener, are in a stronger position ahead of Saturdays encounter despite their unimpressive fielding. They have a strong batting line-up, which runs deep with the likes of Australian Matthew Hayden, Suresh Raina, Dhoni, Jacob Oram and S. Badrinath in their ranks.         
	They also have a formidable bowling department with Sri Lankan spin-wizard Muttiah Muralidharan leading the pack with able assistance from Lakshmipathy Balaji and Shahdab Jakati.         
	The Chennai side would also have a reason to approach the match with a relaxed mindset as they would still have two more chances to score enough points and make the last four stage as they round off their league campaign with matches against tournament laggards Kolkata Knight Riders and Kings XI Punjab.         
	The Mumbai side, on their part, would be under pressure as very few of their tactics paid off against the Rajasthan Royals on Thursday.         
	With frequent chopping and changing in their batting order, the Mumbai Indians star-studded line-up buckled under pressure in the last few matches. But Tendulkar and Sanath Jayasuriya along with JP Duminy, Dwayne Bravo and Abhishek Nayar would be expected to perform at their best on Saturday to clinch a positive result. Their bowling department, led by Lasitha Malinga and Harbhajan Singh, will also have to rise to the occasion.         
	With pressure already being their weakness, the Mumbai Indians will be further worried with the fact that they play the dangerous Delhi DareDevils in their subsequent encounter.         
	We have got big teams to play. We have got the Chennai Super Kings and the Delhi DareDevils who are on the top. It will not be easy and it is a big task for us. We need to help ourselves. We need to get those 15 points to see us through, admitted Mumbais chief mentor Shaun Pollock, after losing on Thursday.

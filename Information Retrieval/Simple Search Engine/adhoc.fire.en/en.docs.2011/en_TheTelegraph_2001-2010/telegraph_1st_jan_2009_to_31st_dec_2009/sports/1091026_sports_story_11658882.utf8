  - Nigerian striker scores four in 5-3 derby win as Mohun Bagan exorcise 1975 ghost       SUDIPTO GUPTA            Edeh Chidi at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: For those who vouch that facts, at times, can be stranger than fiction, Sunday could be deemed as a day when facts propelled to such heights that even fiction, for sure, would not dare to compete with them.         
	It was a battle between two beleaguered teams, desperate for three points to bolster their dwindling fortunes in the I-League.         
	Ninety minutes of flip-flop drama saw Mohun Bagan leaving the pitch with a spring in their strides, having vanquished archrivals 5-3, which also relieved them of a 34-year-old burden  a 0-5 humiliation at the hands of East Bengal.         
	It was a tale of two stars  Jose Ramirez Barreto shone through his presence while Bhaichung Bhutias absence inflicted a pitch-black darkness on his team.         
	Barreto, in his 56-minute stay on the pitch Sunday, did the spadework for Bagans victory, scheming perfect moves for the Edeh Chidis. Bhaichung, on the other hand, was conspicuous by his absence. Yusif Yakubu missed him throughout.         
	East Bengal began well, taking the lead in the ninth minute when Nirmal Chetri headed in from a Rennedy Singh corner, with the Bagan defence looking on like bystanders. With many expecting a demoralised red and gold brigade in the absence of Bhaichung, the goal came as a pleasant surprise.         
	But Edeh Chidi, who had promised after missing goals galore in Bagans last CFL match that he kept the goals in his pockets for the derby, had other plans. In the 17th minute, right back Surkumar Singh, after gaining possession near the centre circle, went past a couple of rival defenders with a brilliant solo run, cut into the box and placed the ball for Chidi, who finished it off with clinical perfection.         
	With the score at 1-1, what followed was a crazy amalgamation of pathetic defending, inept goalkeeping and, not to forget, opportunistic attacking.         
	Karim Bencharifas gamble with rookie Manish Mathani paid off, when in the 22nd minute, his low pile-driver off a failed East Bengal clearance went in, thanks to an Abhra Mondal bungle. Barretos brilliant and measured centre in the 33rd minute found Chidi inside the box, who obliged with a strong header to score Bagans third goal.         
	If Abhra was the bungling-in-charge of the East Bengal goal, young Shilton Paul was on a similar duty, letting in a soft goal in the 34th minute, when he failed to stop a feeble Yakubu push. Subhas Bhowmicks wards restored parity just before half-time, when a curling Rennedy free-kick kissed Yakubus head before landing in Bagan net.         
	With the score 3-3 at the halfway mark, Chidi decided to create history, in style. He added two more in the 46th and the 65th minute to become a legend in Indian football.         
	And talking about the negatives in the match Who cares!

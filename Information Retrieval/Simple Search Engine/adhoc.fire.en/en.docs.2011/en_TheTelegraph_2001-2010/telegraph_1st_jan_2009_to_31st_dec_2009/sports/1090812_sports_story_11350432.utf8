The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ballack boost for Germany 
                                                     Ballack boost for Germany

	London: The season has barely started and Michael Ballack has already flattened an opponent, angered Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson and picked up his first winners medal of the season.         
	That is good news for Germany as they resumes their World Cup qualifying campaign in Azerbaijan on Wednesday with their captain showing he is over a lingering toe injury and back to his skillful and aggressive best.         
	Although the Premier League doesnt start until Saturday, the Chelsea midfielder has a very competitive game behind him after recovering from injury. He was involved in one of the controversial incidents against Manchester United in the traditional start to the English season, the Community Shield, on Sunday.         
	Before Chelsea won a penalty shootout after a 2-2 draw at Wembley, Ballack blatantly blocked Uniteds fullback Patrice Evra in an incident which happened to precede Chelsea scoring their second goal and had Ferguson shouting at the referee.         
	It was a lively start to the English season even though the Premier League, like Italys Serie A and Spains La Liga, is yet to kick off         
	The Bundesliga has already started, however, and that means Germany have no excuses if they fail to beat Azerbaijan in Baku and open up a four-point advantage over Russia at the top of Group 4.         
	If you believe you can be successful with a 90-percent effort, that could have dire consequences, said Germany coach Joachim Loew, whose team leads the Russians by one point. We have to win the game so that we can defend our good position in the group.         
	Evra arrived a little bruised at Frances training camp ahead of Wednesdays Group 7 qualifying game against the Faeroe Islands in Torshavn.With eight points to make up on group leader Serbia, the French cant afford to slip up against the last place Faeroes even though Raymond Domenechs team has two games in hand on the Serbs.         
	Be true to yourselves, be worthy of the French team shirt, anything other than a win would be a catastrophe, Domenech said in a message to his stars, who are well aware how much of a disaster it would be.         
	If we cant beat the Faeroe Islands then we have no right to be at the World Cup, said striker Nicolas Anelka, who also played for Chelsea in Sundays Community Shield at Wembley.         
	In another of the five World Cup games being played on Wednesday Croatia go to Belarus with both teams almost resigned to chasing the runners-up spot in Group 6.         
	Runaway leaders England have won all seven games so far and will guarantee finishing top to capture a place at next years World Cup in South Africa by beating Croatia at home September 9.         
	That would leave Croatia, Ukraine and Belarus chasing second for a place in the play-offs. A Belarus victory in Minsk would lift the team from fourth to second with a point advantage over the other two.         
	With no World Cup game to play this time, England have angered some of the Premier League managers by arranging a friendly with the Netherlands, which has already captured a place in the finals at the top of Group 9.         
	The game comes with clubs building up to Saturdays start of the Premier League and the England stars have had to break off domestic training to join up with national team coach Fabio Capello for a game in Amsterdam.         
	Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard wont be going, however, pulling out of the squad with a slight groin injury.           (AP)

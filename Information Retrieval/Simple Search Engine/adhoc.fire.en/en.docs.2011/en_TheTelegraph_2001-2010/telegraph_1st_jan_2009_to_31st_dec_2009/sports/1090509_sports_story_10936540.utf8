                                                     Super Kings brawn up against Shanes brain

	Kimberley: A mouth-watering clash between a consistent batting side and a strategically proficient team is on the cards as table toppers Chennai Super Kings and the Rajasthan Royals face off in the Indian Premier League (IPL) here Saturday.         
	There is not much to choose between the two teams as far as their performance in the last couple of matches are concerned. However, the Super Kings seemed to be much more consistent in batting and bowling, but sloppy in fielding. They will be aiming to notch up their fifth win on the trot while the Royals would be plotting revenge after losing to the Chennai side by 38 runs in Pretoria on April 30.         
	The two teams have same number of points (11), have won five matches each, lost three each and there was no result in one of both teams matches, but the Super Kings are ahead on net run rate. This shows that the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led side has done better in batting. In fact, the Super Kings have crossed 150 in all their matches.         
	The Royals were also dealt a blow by the injury of all-rounder Shane Watson who has been ruled out of IPL after suffering a mild groin injury during Australias one-off Twenty20 International against Pakistan in Dubai. Watson, the player of the tournament in IPLs first edition, would have solved a lot of problems in the inconsistent Royals middle-order apart from strengthening the pace attack.         
	The Super Kings batting has been firing all along with retired Australian Matthew Hayden leading the charge and Suresh Raina and Dhoni himself in fine touch. In fact, Hayden (378 runs) and Raina (296) are occupying the first two places among the run-getters in this IPL at the moment.         
	In the bowling department, Laxmipathy Balaji has been among the wickets (11). Muttiah Muralidharan (7) and little known Shadab Jakati (9) have also been doing wonders. Dhoni can also rely on part-timer Raina after his immaculate bowling against the Kings XI Punjab Thursday.         
	One area of concern for the Super Kings is fielding. Dhoni was understandably angry with the shoddy fielding of his side against the Kings XI as his players dropped easy catches of key opposition players. The team management will have to address this issue if they are to put pressure on stroke makers like Graeme Smith, Naman Ojha, Yusuf Pathan and Ravindra Jadeja. The Royals batting can fire anytime with Smith close to his best form after scoring 77 against the Kings XI Punjab in Durban.

                                                   Vinod hits 3-under 
                      
	Panchkula: Vinod Kumar returned a brilliant three-under 69 card to shot into lead after the second round of PGTI Players Championship, here on Friday. Gaganjeet Bhullar (65, 73), the overnight leader, slipped into second place after returning a one over 73 at Panchkula Golf Club.         
	Vinod, who had earlier fired 67 in Round I, took his overall score to eight-under 136 and leads Bhullar by two strokes. Mohammed Siddikur Rahman (69, 70) occupies third position at five-under 139.         
	Vinod Kumar put up a solid show on Friday and the 29-year-old Delhi golfer was five under after 10 holes at one stage after birdie on the 10th hole, eagle on the 12th and birdies on the 15th and first.         
	However two bogeys (2nd and fourth) on the back nine, marred his card. I didnt play as well as yesterday (Thursday) but I am happy to be leading at this stage. (PTI)

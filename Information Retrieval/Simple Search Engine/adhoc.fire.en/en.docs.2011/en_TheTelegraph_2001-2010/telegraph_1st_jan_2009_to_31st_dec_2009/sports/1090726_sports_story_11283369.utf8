The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bangla have high hopes
                                                   Bangla have high hopes
                      
	Roseau (Dominica): Bangladesh would be looking at christening international crickets newest venue with victories in the first of the three one-dayers against the West Indies when the series kicks off Sunday at Windsor Park here.         
	The Tigers would probably have had arrived with low expectations in the Caribbean, but fortune favoured them when the leading West Indies players chose to boycott the series.         
	Their replacements were no match for the Bangladeshis, who convincingly swept the two-Test series for the boost of confidence that their appointed captain and leading fast bowler Mashrafe Mortaza set as one of their objectives. Sadly, Mortaza played only a minor role in the Test series triumph, following a fall which aggravated a previous right knee injury.         
	Shakib-al Hasan will lead the side, as he did during the Tests. (AFP)

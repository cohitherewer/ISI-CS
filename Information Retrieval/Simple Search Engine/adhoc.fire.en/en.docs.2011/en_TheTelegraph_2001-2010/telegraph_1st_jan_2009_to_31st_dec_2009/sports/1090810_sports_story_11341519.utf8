                                                   Players safety reason behind England move
  - Decision to pull out of world meet invites sharp criticism from Indian shuttlers         OUR BUREAU AMP; AGENCIES                                  
	England on Sunday announced an 11th-hour withdrawal from the World Badminton Championships citing Lashkar-e-Toiba threats despite assertions by the Indian government there is no danger to the week-long event.         
	Badminton England (BE) simply was not convinced by Home Minister P Chidambarams assurance of foolproof security and went by a recent Home Ministry advisory on threat perception to the event before withdrawing its eight-member contingent.         
	This was an incredibly tough decision and one we didnt take lightly, BE CEO Adrian Christy said. After the Olympic Games, this is the most prestigious Championships in the world but we were not prepared to risk the safety of our players, coaches and staff in what we felt could have been a very volatile environment, Christy said.         
	Accordingly, the England contingent, including Olympic silver medallist Nathan Robertson, will return home immediately, he said.         
	None of the English shuttlers are seeded either in men or womens singles in the tournament.         
	Meanwhile, in New Delhi, an external affairs ministry spokesman said there is no cause for concern as adequate protective measures have been taken. All precautions have been taken. All necessary and adequate security measures are in place. There is no cause for concern, he said. India is in touch with participating nations with regard to the security and other aspects, he added.         
	Its not the first time that England pulled out of tournaments in India. Two English shuttlers  Carl Baxter and Rajiv Ouseph  skipped the Indian Open Grand Prix badminton in Hyderabad in March this year. The duo was advised against the trip by the British Foreign Office in London.         
	Then last year, an English cricket team led by Kevin Pietersen, had left India midway through a one day series following the Mumbai terror attacks. They however, returned to play two Test matches.         
	Christy said BE has been in constant touch with the Foreign Office and British High Commission before arriving at the decision.         
	The conclusion is that safety is of paramount importance and therefore, with great regret, the team will be returning home immediately, Christy added.         
	England will have to pay $250,000, as is the practice for last minute withdrawals, and the organisers made it clear that this was not a fine.

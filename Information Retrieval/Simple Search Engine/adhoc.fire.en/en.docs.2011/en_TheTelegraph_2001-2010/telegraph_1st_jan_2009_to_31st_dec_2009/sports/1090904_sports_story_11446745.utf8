                                                   Bolt gives 100m a miss
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                       
	Brussels: Usain Bolt will not compete against world silver medallist Tyson Gay in the 100m at the sixth and final Golden League meet of the season on Friday.         
	Bolt has opted only for the 200m here. Gay, however, will be up against Asafa Powell.         
	Ive run a lot of 100m races this season, thats why in agreement with my coach, I decided to run the 200m in Brussels, said Bolt.         
	Sprinting line-ups aside, there are only three athletes who remain on course for netting the $1m Golden League jackpot  Kenenisa Bekele, Sanya Richards and Christine Ohuruogu.

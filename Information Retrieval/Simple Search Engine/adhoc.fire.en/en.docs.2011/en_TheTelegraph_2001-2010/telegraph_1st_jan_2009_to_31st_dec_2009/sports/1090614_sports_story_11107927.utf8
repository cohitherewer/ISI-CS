The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | John: No secrets to divulge 
                                                   John: No secrets to divulge 
                      
	Melbourne: Ex-Australia coach John Buchanan, under fire for agreeing to work as a consultant with Englands junior teams, ridiculed suggestions that he would divulge secrets of his former wards to Englands senior team during the stint.         
	Buchanan came under scathing attack from former Australian players, including Shane Warne, with many accusing him of disloyalty ahead of the Ashes next month.         
	However, Buchanan, who will work as a consultant with the England Lions and under-19 squads this month, said it was ridiculous to say he would divulge inside information to the English team.         
	I am spending time with the coaches in their elite program and will sit down at the end of that week to discuss if there is a role for me, he said.         
	I said to them that its a pretty sensitive time and its probably best that I not be around when the Ashes are on, he said.         
	In a sense, I dont know what secrets there are. People have access to vision and data and everything else. Everybody has that information already., he added.

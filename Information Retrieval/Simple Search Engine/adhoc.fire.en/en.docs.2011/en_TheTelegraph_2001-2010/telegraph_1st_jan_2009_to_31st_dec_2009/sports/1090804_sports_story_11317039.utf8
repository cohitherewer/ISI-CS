The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Subhasda was a father figure, says Kapil Dev
                                                   Subhasda was a father figure, says Kapil Dev
    - World Cup-winning captain says Chakraborty always kept his word           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: Even if one didnt quite know much about the state of sport in Bengal, one knew who the concerned minister was. Such was the panama hat-wearing Subhas Chakrabortys profile.         
	He wasnt, of course, a run-of-the-mill politician and didnt bother about being politically correct.         
	To give examples in sport, Chakraborty threw his weight behind Jagmohan Dalmiya when the states chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, was backing Prasun Mukherjee.         
	That was three years ago.         
	As it turned out, Chakraborty supported the right candidate: Dalmiya couldnt be removed from the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) presidents chair.         
	Dalmiya had to leave five-six months later, but that was because of intra-Board politics, and spent around a year-and-a-half in the wilderness before making a comeback in July 2008.         
	He had Chakrabortys backing then too. And to think that in the mid-Eighties, both had actually been at loggerheads over the Society for Sports and Stadium members issue.         
	Yes, there were differences at that point in time, but after a series of meetings, Subhasda understood the CABs point of view From then on, he was always there to help us Whatever the occasion, we could bank on him, Dalmiya, wholl be missing him more than some of the others in sport, reminisced.         
	Another instance of Chakraborty not caring about political correctness was last year, when he extended unconditional support to Kapil Dev, promising to make available stadia under his ministry for the rebel Indian Cricket League.         
	The Board, headed then by politician Sharad Pawar, frowned, yet Chakraborty remained unfazed.         
	But, then, the late minister shared an enviable rapport with Indias only World Cup-winning captain.         
	In fact, back in the summer of 1992, Chakraborty had even persuaded Kapil to turn out for his favourite club, East Bengal, in an exhibition match at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	Rain played spoilsport, but around 65,000 still had something to talk about.         
	On Monday afternoon, a couple of hours after Chakrabortys passing away, Kapil got rather emotional while speaking to The Telegraph from New Delhi.         
	Subhasda wasnt just a good friend... Id say he was more like an elder brother, a father figure... Its a huge personal loss, Kapil, who lost his mother two months ago, said.         
	I cant recall the first time I met Subhasda, but it must have been at least two decades ago... You dont straightaway become close to somebody... Its over a period that our relationship grew...         
	The last time that I met Subhasda was when hed been hospitalised in Delhi, some months ago... After that, I spoke to him on the phone... I dont think I ended any visit to Calcutta without at least talking to Subhasda on the phone, he added.         
	According to Kapil, whose companies (Dev Musco, Dev and Dev) installed the floodlights at the state government-funded Barasat Stadium, Chakraborty always kept his word.         
	Ive dealt with politicians who dont deliver on their promises, but Subhasda was different... If he said something would be done, you didnt have to worry... He kept his word and always acceded to my requests Equally, if Subhasda wanted me to do something, I made sure he wasnt disappointed, Kapil recalled.         
	Awaiting details, Kapil said that he might fly over to Calcutta for Chakrabortys funeral, on Tuesday.         
	Ill remember Subhasda as a wonderful person and somebody who found time for others, especially sportspersons... He was so down to earth Bengal, to my mind, has lost more than a minister, Kapil signed off.         
	Thats a sentiment shared by many.         
	Footnote: Not that Chakraborty ever wore anything flashy in public, but he would be even simpler at home. Indeed, it wouldnt be unusual for visitors at his residence to be received by the minister clad in no more than a lungi and vest!

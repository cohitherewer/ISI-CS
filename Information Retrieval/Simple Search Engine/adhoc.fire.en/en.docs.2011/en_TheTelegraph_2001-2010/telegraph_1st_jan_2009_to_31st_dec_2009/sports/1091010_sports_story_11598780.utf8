	 Mohun Bagan shot off a letter to the All India Football Federation (AIFF) Friday complaining about the standard of refereeing in the I-League. The club requested the AIFF to go through the recordings of the two matches Bagan have played so far and claimed that they have been at the receiving end of a number of wrong decisions      
	The club also warned the federation that they would be forced to take a strong decision were they to be denied justice.      
	Meanwhile, Bagan gave a clean chit to Moroccan coach Karim Bencharifa on the alleged scuffle that he had with a scribe last Tuesday. The club said in a statement Friday that following an enquiry they have found that there was only a heated exchange between the two.                
	 The Calcutta Football League, which was to begin from Monday, has now been postponed due to unavailability of grounds. A possible decision may be taken on Wednesday.

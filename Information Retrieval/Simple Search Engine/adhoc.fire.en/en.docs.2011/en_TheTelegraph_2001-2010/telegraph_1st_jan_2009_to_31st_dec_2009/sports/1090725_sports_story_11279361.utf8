The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chetri is in doubt for Nehru Cup
                                                   Chetri is in doubt for Nehru Cup
            ANSHUMAN ROY                      
	Barcelona: India striker Sunil Chetris injury in right ankle has still not healed and he is doubtful for the Nehru Gold Cup to be held in New Delhi from August 18.         
	Chetri picked up the injury during his stint with Calcuttas East Bengal and a false diagnosis aggravated it.         
	The MRI scan in Calcutta showed that it was just a minor sprain. But when the injury didnt heal even after three months, national coach Bob Houghton asked for another scan to be done in Dubai.         
	The test revealed that Chetri had a muscle tear and he was advised at least three weeks rest.         
	It still aches a little, Chetri said. If I was diagnosed correctly in Calcutta then a proper treatment would have healed the thing.         
	Chetri said he was lucky that he went for the test in Dubai.         
	Just think if I had kept on playing... Then suddenly one jerk during a match and my career would have ended.         
	Chetri, in fact, played for Delhi in the Santosh Trophy but gave in after a match. I could not carry on, he said.         
	Chetris case once again showed how things are run in Calcutta.         
	Without giving any importance to the recovery period, the most vital time after an injury, Calcutta clubs have this tendency of forcing players to play.         
	The diminutive strike will play for Goas Dempo FC in the next season.         
	Chetri has been out of action since a month but he has started light training with his teammates since the last few days.         
	If Chetris injury is forcing Houghton to rethink about the frontline, then Climax Lawrences fatigue is making him upset.         
	According to sources, the Indian thinktank didnt like the idea of Climax being flown to Chennai to play in the Santosh Trophy.         
	He had just returned from the AFC Cup and was straightaway asked to report to the Goan camp. Now he is so tired that he is not being able to give 100 per cent, a source said.         
	Meanwhile, the Indian team will play their first practice match on Saturday against Spanish third division side Unio Esportiva Castelldefels.         
	Defender Gourmangi Singh, who is running a slight temperature, is doubtful for the match. Gourmangi, in fact, complained of fatigue after the practice session on Thursday.         
	The Saturday clash will also give a glimpse of how the Bhaichung Bhutia and Sushil Singh striking combination is shaping up. The match will be played at Gava and will begin at 6 pm (IST).         
	India will lock horns with another third division side, AE Prata, in their second practice match on Wednesday.         
	They play again on August 1 and 5 before flying back home on August 7.

	Guwahati: Top-flight newbies Lajong FC not only sent heavyweights Dempo SC packing but also kept alive their hopes for a semi-final berth in the 31st Federation Cup with a 2-1 win over last years runners-up at the Nehru Stadium Thursday. Dempo had lost 1-2 to Pune FC in their first match here.         
	Lajong went into the lead in as early as the 7th minute through striker Anil Gurung with a neat finish off a measured cross from Seikhohau Tuboi.         
	But the Shillong side watched Dempo pull level when defender Daniel Bidemi muffed a clearance to put the ball into his own net in the 35th minute.         
	Lajong must have felt especially unlucky to have conceded that goal since, in the build up, the linesman missed it when the ball had gone out of play before Dempos Anthony Pereira cross into the box. It was this cross that Bidemi was trying to clear when the ball went in.         
	Dempo were reduced to ten men after defender Anwar was sent off in the 46th minute for two bookable offences.         
	Thereafter, Dempo came under a lot of pressure as Lajong laid siege to their goal. The Goan team had their chances too with Sunil Chetri coming close to scoring in the 32nd and 42nd minutes.         
	Lajong went all out for the winner as the clock showed 10 minutes left for the final whistle.         
	The Gurung-Tuboi combine soon crowned those efforts with a magical piece of work for the decisive goal in the 81st minute.         
	A solo run from the midfield saw Gurung pass for Tuboi who made space between Dempo custodian Tyson and defender Valeriano Rebello to launch into a brilliant bicycle kick that hit the back of the net.         
	As it turns out, Thursdays victory is sweet revenge for Lajong, who had lost 1-4 to Dempo in Goa in the I League.         
	While Dempo coach Armando Colaco did not offer any comment on his sides ouster, Lajongs Stanley Rozario was all praises for his boys.         
	We played really well. We are a young side but never got bogged down by the big names. We played our hearts out and got the desired result. Its a great victory and we are confident of making it to the last four, he said.         
	It was indeed a great achievement for a club, which is still at its infancy stage. The team from Northeast, in its very first year amongst the big boys, has managed to carve out a niche for itself.

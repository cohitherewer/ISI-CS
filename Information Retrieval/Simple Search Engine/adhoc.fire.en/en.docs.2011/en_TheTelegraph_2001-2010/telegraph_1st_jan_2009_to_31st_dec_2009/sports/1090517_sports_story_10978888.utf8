The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvis men face the Chargers
                                                   Yuvis men face the Chargers
                      
	Johannesburg: The Kings XI Punjab, on a high after a morale-boosting six-wicket victory over current league leaders the Delhi DareDevils, would look to keep up their good work against the Deccan Chargers in their must-win Indian Premier League (IPL) match here on Sunday.         
	With 12 points from 12 matches and only one match left after Sundays clash, they will have to win against the Chargers, who are also on 12 points but have played a match less, if they desire to make it to the semi-finals.         
	The Kings XI will have the psychological advantage going into the match as they had beaten Adam Gilchrists men by three wickets in their earlier meeting.         
	Australian fast bowler Brett Lees return has also been a confidence-booster for the Kings XI. Lee had been instrumental against the DareDevils with a match winning effort of three for 15 which has kept the Punjab sides semi-final hope alive.         
	Among the batsmen, Sri Lankan Kumar Sangakkara has been consistent. Mahela Jayawardene, who is suffering from a hamstring injury, is unlikely to return to the side, as indicated by Yuvraj after the match against the DareDevils.         
	For the Chargers, they have to leave behind their cricket suicide committed against the DareDevils on May 13. Their middle order will have to stop gifting away wickets and think of finishing off matches.         
	They will also have to pull up their socks in the fielding department.         
	Rohit Sharma, who had failed in his last three outings, is due for a big score while Gilchrist could be tempted to bring back Herschelle Gibbs at the top and push T. Suman down the order..

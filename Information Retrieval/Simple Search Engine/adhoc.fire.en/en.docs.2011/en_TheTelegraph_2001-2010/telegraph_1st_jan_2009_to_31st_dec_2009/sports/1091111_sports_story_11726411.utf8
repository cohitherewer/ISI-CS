The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tough for Verdasco
                                                                                                                                     Tough for Verdasco
                  Verdasco                     
	Paris: Russias Nikolay Davydenko and Spains Fernando Verdasco moved closer to spots at the World Tour Finals in London with contrasting second-round wins at the Paris Masters on Tuesday.         
	World No.7 Davydenko, who would guarantee a berth in the November 22-29 season finale with a semi-final appearance here, took only 78 minutes to brush aside German Benjamin Becker 6-2, 6-1.         
	Verdasco, the world No.8, who will a book a trip to London if he wins the title but could qualify earlier depending on how other contenders fare, needed over two hours to move past Italian Andreas Seppi 6-7, 6-4, 6-4.         
	The Spaniards win meant Czech Radek Stepanek and Croatias Marin Cilic dropped out of the race, leaving just five players fighting for the two remaining tickets to the London event, featuring the worlds top eight players, with Davydenko and Verdasco first in line.         
	Swede Robin Soderling, Chilean Fernando Gonzalez and Frances Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, the defending champion in Paris, are the other three but stand only an outside chance.         
	Davydenko, 28, who won in Paris in 2006 and is seeded sixth this year, will now meet Soderling or Croatias Ivo Karlovic.         
	Every year, its the same, whether Im in (the World Tour finals) or not depends on how I play in Paris, and Im always in, Davydenko said.         
	Seventh seed Verdasco, 25, next faces Cilic or Polands Lukasz Kubot.         
	All the worlds top 10 players, except the injured Andy Roddick, are in the French capital for the last tournament of the regular season.         
	World No 1 Roger Federer and No.2 Rafael Nadal will get started on Wednesday, against Frenchman Julien Benneteau and Spaniard Nicolas Almagro respectively.           (REUTERS)

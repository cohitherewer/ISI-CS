The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mumbai Indians are finally back to winning ways
                                                   Mumbai Indians are finally back to winning ways
                      
	Port Elizabeth: Ajinkya Rahane and J.P. Duminy scored unbeaten half-centuries on Sunday to steer the Mumbai Indians to a 16-run victory over the Bangalore Royal Challengers in the Indian Premier League.         
	Rahane made 62 and Duminy 52 at the St. Georges Park and put on a third wicket partnership of 104 to help the Mumbai side to 157 for two.         
	The Royal Challengers were never in the run chase, losing wickets in quick succession in the early overs and with no substantial partnership to boast of  the highest being the 23 between openers Jacques Kallis and Virat Kohli.         
	Their top five batsmen  Kallis (12), Kohli (20), Robin Uthappa (4), Ross Taylor (16) and Rahul Dravid (10)  did not contribute much         
	Harbhajan Singh took two for 15 while Dhawal Kulkarni, Lasith Malinga, Dwayne Bravo and debutant Chetanya Nanda managed a wicket each to restrict the Bangalore side to 141 for seven.         
	The 20-year-old Rahane hit four boundaries and a six in 49 balls, while Duminy, an emerging star for South Africa, cracked two boundaries and three sixes in 41 balls.         
	Rahane and Duminys partnership was the perfect response for the Mumbai side after they once again lost veteran openers Sachin Tendulkar and Sanath Jayasuriya early.         
	The duo scored 53 from the last five overs to take the Mumbai sides total past 150 on a wicket which offered swing and bounce early on.         
	The Royal Challengers looked like to be off to a good start with Kallis finding a few boundaries early on. But gradually they lost momentum with wickets falling in quick succession.         
	Mark Boucher played a cameo, an unbeaten 49, for the Royal Challengers but it wasnt enough to see his team through.         
	The Royal Challengers lost their first wicket when Kallis attempted to cut a delivery from Bravo only to be caught by Kulkarni at short-leg.         
	Uthappa followed in the fifth over, finding Tendulkar at mid-wicket off Kulkarni.         
	Leg-spinner Nanda, making his IPL debut, had Kohli caught by Duminy at mid-wicket in his first over to reduce the Royal Challengers to 40 for three.         
	Dravid was then run out by a combination of Malinga and Harbhajan to leave the Bangalore side in trouble at 58 for four.         
	The former India captain was well short of his crease while running for a second run with Harbhajan dislodging the bail after picking a Malinga throw from the deep.         
	The Royal Challengers batsmen tried to accelerate the run rate which had shot up to over 10 after the 10th over and over 11 after the 15th, and they fell one by one in doing so.         
	Malinga compounded the Bangalore sides problems when he bowled Ross Taylor with a trademark yorker.         
	Harbhajan took the last two wickets to fall as Roloef van der Merwe (3) and Vinay Kumar (7) were both stumped by Yogesh Takawale while looking for big shots.         
	Boucher and captain Anil Kumble (7 not out) needed 40 off the last two overs but that was too tough a task and they could score only 23.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB, ICC disagree over fees
                                                   PCB, ICC disagree over fees
                      
	 Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the International Cricket Council (ICC) are yet to sort out the issue of hosting fees for the next months Champions Trophy, which was shifted out to South Africa last September due to security reasons.         
	The ICC is saying it will pay Pakistan around $750,000 but the PCB is quoting figures at around $2.5 million. This issue has to be sorted out soon because the Champions Trophy is due next month, a PCB official said.         
	Mani role         
	 Karachi: Former ICC president Ehsan Mani has advised the PCB against giving up their demand to host their share of the 2011 World Cup matches at neutral venues, sources said. It was on his advice that the PCB decided to pursue legal action against the ICC, a move that has proved costly without yielding any results so far as the ICC has refused to give into the demand to host matches in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.         
	Tour venues         
	 Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board has still not decided the venues for its one-day and Test series against New Zealand in October-November. The series has to be played outside Pakistan after New Zealand Cricket refused to send their team to the strife-torn country.         
	Officials flayed         
	 Karachi: Pakistans former Test players  Mohsin Khan, Zaheer Abbas, Sarfaraz Nawaz  and Muhammad Ali Shah, a senior member of the PCB governing council, have demanded sacking of coach Intikhab Alam and manager Yawar Saeed following the national teams poor show in Sri Lanka.         
	Television cameras showed Saeed dozing off during the second ODI at Dambulla on Saturday and this has only added fuel to the debate that the Pakistan team management needs a younger and more active coach and manager.         
	Razzak out         
	 Dhaka: Bangladesh left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak has been ruled out of this months one-day International (ODI) series in Zimbabwe with a hamstring problem, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said on Sunday. Razzak picked up the injury while batting during the third ODI against the West Indies at St Kitts on Friday. The BCB added that fellow left-arm spinner Enamul Haque Jr would replace Razzak. The five-match ODI series against Zimbabwe will start on August 9.         
	CSA row         
	 Durban: The mediators appointed to resolve the dispute between the Cricket South Africa (CSA) and its affiliate the Gauteng Cricket Board (GCB) have managed to bring the two warring bodies on common ground at least on some issues.         
	Symmo for T20         
	 Melbourne: New Zealands domestic side Auckland Aces are keen to sign Andrew Symonds for their Twenty20 competition and have asked his Deccan Chargers teammate Scott Styris to convince the Australian all-rounder.           AGENCIES

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harbhajan downplays incident
                                                   Harbhajan downplays incident
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Harbhajan Singh Thursday sought to downplay the incident at the Bangalore International Airport, saying he, at no stage, had hit or jabbed a cameraman before leaving for the tri-series in Sri Lanka.         
	Harbhajan had reportedly jabbed at a cameraman Wednesday after his camera had hit him on the head while he was taking his luggage out from a car before entering the airport.         
	I am very particular of being touched and hit at my head or my patka. As a prompt reflex, not even knowing what hit my head I pushed the object, realising it after I pushed it that it was a camera. At no stage did I hit or slap the cameraman. Neither will I ever do it, the off-spinner wrote in his blog.         
	There was a clear security cover around me. The cameraman breached that cover. The CISF guard and official asked the camera guy to step back as they saw him being at fault of hitting my head with his camera and crossing the security cover, he said.

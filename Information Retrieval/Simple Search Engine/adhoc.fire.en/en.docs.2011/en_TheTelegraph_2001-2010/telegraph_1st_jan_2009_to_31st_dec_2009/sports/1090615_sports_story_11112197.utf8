                                                     Coach miffed with strikers
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Tamil Nadus Riju with the highest scorers trophy in Chennai on Sunday. (PTI)                           
	Chennai: Bengal coach Raghu Nandy blamed his strikers profligacy for the loss against Goa in the Santosh Trophy final, here on Sunday.         
	What can you do if you miss chances. Surojit (Bose), Puiya (P.C. Lalawmpuiya) and Lalkamal (Bhowmick) should have converted those chances.         
	Nandy said skipper Habibur Rehman Mondal was missed but praised replacement Rajib Ghosh. He was superb. I have no complains, he said.         
	Nandy refused to accept that the Goans were better on the day. Never. We dominated the match. They were never in the match, he said.         
	Nandy said he had to substitute Bishwajit Saha as he was unable to carry on. He was having unbearable pain in his left thigh and could not even walk. I had no option thats why I continued with him till the 109th minute. I was working in distress, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Felix DSouza revealed how a tip from former goalkeeper Brahamanand helped him in the tie-breaker. Before the tournament, Brahamanand sir told me to stare at the penalty taker from half line. It seems they get nervous. I tried doing that today and it really worked, he beamed.         
	Not a good penalty stopper by his own admission, Felix said he has never stopped one for his club Sporting Clube de Goa. Never man, never. Today too I was scared, tense. You people must have seen how I was making a prayer when our players were taking penalties, he said.

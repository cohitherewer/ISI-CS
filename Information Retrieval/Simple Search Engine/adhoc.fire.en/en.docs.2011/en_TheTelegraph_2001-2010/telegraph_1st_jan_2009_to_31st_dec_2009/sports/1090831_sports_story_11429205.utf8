            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Monday will be a red letter day in Indian tennis. When Somdev Dev Varman and Sania Mirza take on their respective opponents in the US Open, it will be the first time in more than a decade that India will have a mens and womens singles player featuring in the main draw of a Grand Slam.         
	Somdev will take on Frederico Gil of Portugal. On the eve of his first-round match, Somdev spoke to The Telegraph.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q Finally you are on the big stage, where not many Indians have been before. What is going through your mind?         
	A I am happy to have achieved my first goal by qualifying. Now I just want to focus on my first-round match. Of course its a special day for me and Indian tennis.         
	Would you say you have changed your game since playing the qualifying rounds of Wimbledon? What has been the difference between then and now?         
	I love playing in the US summer hard court season. It suits my game best. Other than that, I just kept working hard and believing in myself.         
	Having done college in the US, the Open must be all the more special for you. What are the images of the tournament you have in the mind and what does qualifying mean to you in this regard?         
	Every Slam is special in its own way. Of course I have a lot more friends here, so for me to perform in front of them is special. My sister is here, too, and thats pretty special for me!

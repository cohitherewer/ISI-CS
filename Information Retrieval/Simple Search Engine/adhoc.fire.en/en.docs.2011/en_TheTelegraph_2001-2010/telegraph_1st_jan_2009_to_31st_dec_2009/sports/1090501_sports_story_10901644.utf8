The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Challengers look for revenge
                                                   Challengers look for revenge
                                      Anil Kumble and Kumar Sangakkara have been the best performers for their teams so far      
	Durban: The Royal Challengers Bangalore will look to avenge their defeat against the Kings XI Punjab when the two sides face each other for the second time in the Indian Premier League (IPL) here Friday.         
	Under Kevin Pietersen, the Royal Challengers had started the tournament with a win against the Rajasthan Royals but then lost four matches on the trot before pulling off a narrow win over the Kolkata Knight Riders Wednesday.         
	With Pietersen leaving for national duty, there is uncertainty surrounding as to who will be his successor with coach Ray Jennings saying that the pre-tournament back-up plan of having Jacques Kallis at the helm may not be used given the all-rounders patchy form. The South African has struggled to find a regular place in the team so far.         
	On the batting front, the Challengers have tried different combinations for the opening slot, but have still not found a stable pair.         
	Jesse Ryder, Ross Taylor, Robin Uthappa  all have failed and even middle-order batsmen like Jacques Kallis and Virat Kohli are far from being consistent.         
	With the exception of Rahul Dravid, who has been on leave to attend to his new-born child, the batting has been a letdown for the Bangalore team.         
	The Royal Challengers bowling looks equally lacklustre. An inconsistent Dale Steyn has been in and out of the team and only Praveen Kumar (6) and Anil Kumble (8) have been among the wickets.         
	The Kings have been in rampaging form, winning three matches on the trot after being at the receiving end of the rain Gods ire twice  against the Delhi DareDevils and the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	Although their batting looks a bit inconsistent, Kumar Sangakkara has made sure they always reach the safe zone.         
	Even Ravi Bopara has played some crucial innings at the top and with all-rounder Irfan Pathan scoring regularly, things are working out quite well for the Mohali team.Among the bowlers, pacer Yusuf Abdulla has been the wrecker-in-chief, while leg-spinner Piyush Chawla has managed the spin department well.         
	The only concern for the Punjab team is the form of captain Yuvraj Singh, whose bat has been surprisingly silent since the start of the tournament.         
	The Kings XI are on the third spot in the table, with three wins from five matches.         
	The Royal Challengers are placed seventh, just above the Kolkata Knight Riders, with four points from six matches.

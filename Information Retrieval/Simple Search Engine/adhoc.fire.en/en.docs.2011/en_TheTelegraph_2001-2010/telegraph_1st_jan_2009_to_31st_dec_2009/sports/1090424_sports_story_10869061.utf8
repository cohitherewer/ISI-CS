                                                     Glenn McGrath: I would like to work in India
  - Aussie legend says current IPL season could be his last       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Glenn McGrath with late wife Jane                                 
	Cape Town: At some stage, Glenn McGrath plans to extend the McGrath Foundations activities to India.         
	The Foundation, set up by Glenn and his late wife Jane, brings about awareness and raises funds for things related to breast cancer.         
	Jane, it may be recalled, died in June last year following complications after breast cancer surgery.         
	Once the Foundation is more settled, yes, Id like to work in India too... I know there would be friends willing to help, Glenn told The Telegraph the other day.         
	The 39-year-old great, who quit playing for Australia after the 2007 World Cup, said that this could be his last season in the IPL.         
	Ive got two young children (James, Holly) and I cant be leaving them with relatives all the time... Besides, Im too old, Glenn pointed out.         
	Hes been turning out for the Delhi DareDevils.

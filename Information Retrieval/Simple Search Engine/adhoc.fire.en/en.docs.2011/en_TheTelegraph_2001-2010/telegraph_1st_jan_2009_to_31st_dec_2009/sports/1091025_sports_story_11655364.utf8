                                                     Dhoni: Long series provides a chance to bounce back
  - Aussies have a side which has got better talent when it comes to all-rounders             Mahendra Singh Dhoni                           
	Vadodara: Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Saturday said the length of the current series would give the teams an opportunity to bounce back.         
	This is a long series which provides an opportunity to come back into the series. Whichever side loses the first few games have ample time to come back. It is important to play good cricket throughout, Dhoni said at the pre-match media conference here.         
	Its not like a five-game or four-game series where you win the first three and the tournament is in your hands, he said.         
	It may recalled that Ponting, on his arrival, had questioned the logic of playing a long series. Dhoni said there were no major fitness worries. Most of the guys are fit. Most guys are carrying small niggles but no major injuries. You cant do much when someone gets injured while batting or bowling during practice sessions, which are so intense.         
	Thats part and parcel... If you get injured often in a short time span, then you are unlucky, Dhoni said.         
	On his own injury, sustained during nets on Friday, Dhoni said he was feeling much better. Today Im a lot better.         
	The Indian captain said they do not have the luxury to go in with five bowlers like Australia and hoped part-timers would do the job. We have often relied on the part-timers. They have contributed, especially in a situation like this where they may get assistance from the wicket. Thats one thing in the mind but to comment right now is too early, he said.         
	All-rounders are very crucial. If you have a good all-rounder you can play with five specialist bowlers. They have that luxury. They have a side which has got the better talent when it comes to all-rounders, he said.         
	Dhoni felt that though fast bowlers did extremely well for India in their last Test series at home against Australia, the one-day scenario was different.         
	Its a completely different ball game. The ball is different, a white ball. With the red ball reverse swing comes in and the length and line is different. Zaheers not here which is a factor, he said.         
	Last time the fast bowlers did a great job but at the same time spinners performance was also great. Even part-timers got wickets. The situation and scenario are also very different, Dhoni said.         
	Dhoni felt the wicket prepared for the game at the Reliance Stadium would not crack as much as it did in the last ODI played here, between India and Sri Lanka.         
	Right now theres some stickiness. Its an early start. You will have to see conditions tomorrow (Sunday). There will be a fair amount of dew on the field at this time. It looks a good track and it seems it will not break up as much as it did the last time we played here, Dhoni said.         
	Asked about the fact that key Australian bowlers, like pace spearhead Brett Lee, have acclimatised to the conditions by playing in the Champions League, Dhoni said: It has given them good experience. But at the same time it can be said they are a bit exhausted. Yesterday (Friday) also they played a game.         
	Dhoni refused to get into a debate over the sacking of the bowling and fielding coaches, Venkatesh Prasad and Robin Singh, ahead of the series. We have a coach Gary Kirsten. We are trying to do whatever we can with the available resources, he said.         
	Dhoni reiterated that his team was not worried about the ICC rankings.         
	I have said often that we concentrate on playing good cricket and that takes care of the ratings, he said. (Agencies)

                                                                                                                       7                                        New Zealand fight back
                  Vettori in Dunedin on Wednesday                       
	Dunedin: Captain Daniel Vettori (99) Wednesday missed out on a well-deserved hundred but together with Brendon McCullum, steered New Zealand to 404 for eight on a rain-marred second day of the first cricket Test against Pakistan.         
	Resuming at 276 for six, the New Zealand skipper put on a fearless batting display and added 164 runs for the seventh wicket with wicket-keeper McCullum, who made 78 before being bowled by Umar Gul.         
	Only 36 overs were bowled Wednesday due to rain interruptions and the hosts defied all odds to score 128 runs in a stunning fightback.         
	The left-handed Vettori smacked 14 boundaries in his 133-ball knock, which ended when he edged one off Gul to Kamran Akmal behind the wicket.         
	Shane Bond (8) and Iain Brien (2) were at the crease at stumps.         
	At the start of the second day McCullum, who was on 25 after Day I, provided brilliant support at the other end.         
	He batted with patience and resolve, battling 154 balls.           (PTI)

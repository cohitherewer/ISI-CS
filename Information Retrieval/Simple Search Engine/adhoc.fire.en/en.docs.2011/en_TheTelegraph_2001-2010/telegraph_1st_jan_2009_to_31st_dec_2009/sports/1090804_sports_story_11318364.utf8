                                                   Sourav: A sad day for state
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Calcutta: There was little to suggest that Sourav Ganguly and Subhas Chakraborty shared a particularly close relationship  the late minister, in fact, made a derogatory comment last November  but the states No. 1 sports icon spoke respectfully on Monday evening.         
	Its a very sad day for the state Subhasdas was such a recognisable face and he always connected with people Id say he was a leader of people, Sourav told The Telegraph.         
	He added: Id met Subhasda just some weeks ago (on July 12), during a charity soccer match at the Barasat Stadium, and found him quite fit then Id known him for such a long time, for so many years         
	While declining to talk of the reported differences between him and Chakraborty, Sourav said: This just isnt the day (for that)

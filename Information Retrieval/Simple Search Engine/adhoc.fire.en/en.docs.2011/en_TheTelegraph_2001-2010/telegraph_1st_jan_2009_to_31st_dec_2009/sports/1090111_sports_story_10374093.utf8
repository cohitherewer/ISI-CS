The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Review in the USA, but not by Obamas team
                                                   Review in the USA, but not by Obamas team
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: Come January 20 and a new chapter will unfold in the United States of America (USA). Cricket, of course, wont be a priority for Barack Obama, who takes guard as President that day, but a review is scheduled for January 24.         
	That wont be undertaken by Obamas team, but by the International Cricket Council (ICC), specifically principal advisor Inderjit Singh Bindra and chief executive Haroon Lorgat.         
	Bindra and Lorgat will meet the USA Cricket Association (USACA) officials in New York.         
	The USACA, it may be noted, has recently been taken back into the ICCs fold. Infighting, largely between factions dominated by members of Indian and Jamaican origin, had led to its suspension.         
	At this point in time, the USACA (an associate member of the ICC) is headed by Gladstone Dainty, who is understood to have the blessings of the West Indies Cricket Board.         
	The West Indies lacks clout in the ICC, but is the full (Test-playing) member closest to the USA and, therefore, has some influence in the region.         
	Given the huge potential, we dont want to lose the market in the USA... At the same time, we in the ICC need to be clear about the direction the USACA is taking... Thats why this review, Bindra, a former president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Saturday, he added: Many in the USA have an emotional attachment to cricket and that needs to be harnessed... Sadly, theres been in-fighting from the early 1990s... Now, apparently, everybody is getting together and thats a good sign... The USACA cant afford to have more factionalism.         
	Indeed, but for the in-fighting, the Sahara Cup (a joint venture between India and Pakistan) wouldve been held in the USA and not Canada, in the second half of the 1990s.         
	Because of the expats presence, the USA is seen by many as a viable offshore venue. But merely holding matches there wont help the USACA in a significant manner.         
	The USA apart, the ICC is looking to especially tap the market in China, which is an affiliate member (lowest rung), but where enthusiasm doesnt seem to be at a premium.         
	Bindra, the first-ever principal advisor, will be heading to China in April. Hopefully, things should work out smoothly both in the USA and China, he said.         
	The focus, understandably, will be on cricket at the grassroots  beginning with the schools.

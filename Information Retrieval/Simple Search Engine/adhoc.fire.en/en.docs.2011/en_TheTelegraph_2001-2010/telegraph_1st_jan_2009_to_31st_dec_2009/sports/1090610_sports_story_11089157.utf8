                                                     Early hiccups for Black Caps
                  Graeme Smith                     
	London: Brilliant bowling and some excellent fielding helped New Zealand restrict South Africa to 128 for seven in a group D match of the ICC World Twenty20 at Lords, here on Tuesday.               
	At the end of seven overs, New Zealand were 38/2. Brendon McCullum (25) and Ross Taylor (3) were at the crease.               
	Captain Graeme Smith scored 33 and put on an opening stand of 49 with Jacques Kallis, who hit 24, but South Africa then lost their next nine wickets for 77 runs after an excellent fielding display from New Zealand.         
	Both Kallis and Smith played restrained knocks. Kallis hit two boundaries and a six in his 23-ball stay, while Smith managed four hits to the fence in his 35-ball knock.         
	Ian Butler was the pick of the bowlers with two for 13 from four overs.         
	With both sides having already qualified for the Super 8 stage, the game was played in a relaxed atmosphere.         
	The opening stand ended in the eighth over when Kallis was run out by a direct hit from Brendon McCullum.         
	Gibbs was a brief stay at the crease as he managed a meagre 3 before being caught by Scott Styris off his own bowling.         
	Smith went with the total on 63, bowled by Butler.         
	Roelof van der Merwe (0) was out two runs later castled by Nathan McCullum.         
	The prize wicket of AB de Villiers, run out by a direct hit from Martin Guptill for 15, ended South Africas chances of posting a healthy score.         
	Mark Boucher was caught for 6 by Brendon off Butler in a vain bid to accelerate the run rate in the 18th over.         
	JP Duminy went in the penultimate over for 29, chipping a ball from Kyle Mills straight to Neil Broom, one delivery after hitting the same bowler for a six.         
	The South Africans managed just six runs from the final six balls.         
	Nathan bowled well too giving away just 18 runs from his four overs taking one wicket.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gary dossier has players talking
                                                   Gary dossier has players talking
                      
	Centurion: Coach Gary Kirstens reported mantra for Indian cricketers to have sex to boost competitiveness was the subject of much amusement and discussion among the cricketers assembled here for the Champions Trophy.         
	Kirsten, a former South African opener, has reportedly circulated a four-part document which broadly envisages an active sexual life and disciplined food and sporting habits, aimed at helping the players on and off the field.         
	The document, the contents of which are quite unusual, looks back to Indias history, its food habits and its lack of aggression.         
	From a psychological (body) perspective having sex increases testosterone levels, which causes an increase in strength, energy, aggression and competitiveness. Conversely, not having sex for a few months causes a significant drop in testosterone levels in both males and females with corresponding passiveness and decrease in aggression, the document said.         
	The document, jointly prepared by Kirsten and mental conditioning expert Paddy Upton, advised cricketers to go solo if they didnt have partners.         
	The dossier came up for discussion during the press conferences of Australia skipper Ricky Ponting and his England counterpart Andrew Strauss.         
	A bemused Strauss said: With regards to sexual habits, I dont think that has come up in any of our dossiers. Not sure if it is likely to either, for us. I dont know.         
	To a similar question, Ponting replied: The team vision document would be interesting. No, I dont think it would (in ours). Thats all I can say. You caught me off-guard with that question.

  - Disastrous batting sees bengal concede first-innings lead         A STAFF REPORTER            Ravindra Jadeja (left) celebrates one of his wickets with a teammate at the Eden on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: The Bengal middle-order surrendered the advantage on the final day as Saurashtra enforced follow-on in their Ranji Trophy match at the Eden on Friday.         
	The hosts needed 331 runs to overhaul Saurashtras 650 with eight wickets remaining. But as wickets fell at regular intervals, none of the home batsmen showed the application and determination to stay put and the team ended 194 runs in arrears. In their second essay, Bengal closed at 153 for one.         
	Saurashtra got three points while Bengal had to be satisfied with one from the drawn encounter.         
	Ravindra Jadeja took four wickets in a disciplined spell on an unresponsive pitch.         
	Manoj Tiwarys departure in the second over of the day started the slide. The stand-in captain chased a wide delivery outside the off stump to be caught at slip. Arindam Das didnt stay much longer as he was trapped plumb in front. Wriddhiman Saha yet again failed to make a mark.         
	It was the perfect platform for the wicketkeeper-batsman to pile on the runs and he had everything going in his favour. All that was needed was a bit of discipline and concentration. Having done the groundwork, he carelessly holed out to bowler Jadeja for 35.         
	Wriddhiman hasnt done enough to enhance his reputation in the season so far and the India hopeful needs to do well in the remaining two group matches to stay on the national selectors radar. All hopes rested on Sourav Ganguly and the former India captain started off with a flourish.         
	A glide past slip and a square drive showcased his class. In between, though, there was an edge between slip and gully.         
	Sourav was troubled by back spasms during his 25-minute stay and needed attention from the physio. Just when everything looked in place, Sourav dragged an angular delivery from left-arm seamer Sandip Jobanputra on to his stumps for 16.         
	The writing was on the wall. Rohan Gavaskars late resilience  46 not out  went in vain in the absence of a resolute tail. Jadeja later apologised to Match Referee Sumit Dutta of Assam after being reprimanded for getting into a slanging match with Gavaskar following the dismissal of Sourasish Lahiri.         
	We knew if we managed to get two/three wickets we would be able to put them under pressure. Once we got a wicket in the second over, we knew we had a chance We just needed to apply the pressure each time there was a new batsman at the crease, said Saurashtra captain Jaydev Shah.         
	Once Sourav got out it boosted our confidence he was the one who could have taken them closer to 650 and handled the pressure. The second new ball, taken at the start of the day, did all the damage, he added.         
	Saurashtra enforced the follow on to pile on the humiliation. And, to make matters worse, Rohan Banerjee left in the fourth over of the innings. The leg-before decision was not to the openers liking and he stood his ground before walking back.         
	It was enough to incur the wrath of the Match Referee and Banerjee had to file a written apology. Arindam Das and Deep Dasgupta prevented any further damage to add 128 runs for the unbroken second wicket.         
	It must be mentioned that the last hour dished out farcical cricket after Bengal insisted they wanted to continue batting despite appeals from the rival captain to call it off. Jadeja kept while Sagar Yogani bowled one over.         
	Bengal next play Uttar Pradesh in Kanpur, from December 8. Sourav may be available for the away match.         
	Meanwhile, Bengal players were fined ten per cent of their match fees for bowling three overs short. Captain Tiwary was fined 20 per cent.

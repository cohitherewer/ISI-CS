            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                
	Nottingham: Its one thing to make a statement on the field, quite another to read one, off it, and walk off without bothering about protocol.         
	Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni did just that, at Trent Bridge, on Friday afternoon. Clearly, it took no more than a few minutes for his reputation of being calm and level-headed to take a beating.         
	Even if our cricketers dont author a record in edition No.2 of the World T20, they definitely set one on the eve of launching their trophy-defending campaign.         
	Irked by a newspaper report back home, which claimed there was tension between captain Dhoni and vice-captain Virender Sehwag, the players and the support staff paraded themselves before the media, scripting a strange precedent.         
	That, obviously, wasnt enough (at the squash court within the Trent Bridge complex): Dhoni read a hand-written statement and then walked out, without taking questions. His men, of course, followed.                 
	One was left stunned.         
	The International Cricket Councils communications officer, Sami-ul-Hasan, was the first to react and told the team management that a pre-match media conference was mandatory.         
	Just as well, for everyone seemed to have forgotten that Indias opening match, against not-to-be-underrated Bangladesh, was the very next day.         
	Five minutes later, word came that coach Gary Kirsten would represent Team India before the media. Instead of 25 minutes, though, he took a good three-quarters of an hour to turn up.         
	Dhoni, for his part, left for London to attend the opening ceremony at Lords. However, inclement weather forced the organisers to do away with what would have been a pleasing spectacle.         
	The show of unity had a purpose... We wanted to send a message across to our fans... I dont think this will serve as a distraction. If anything, it has brought the team even closer... I was blown away when I heard of the report which talked of infighting... Such things hurt... Ive not experienced any (infighting), Kirsten said.         
	In the coachs opinion, the exercise in unity should actually be seen as a huge positive and had been decided upon collectively.                     
	According to The Telegraphs sources, the Board of Control for Cricket in India brass suggested that something strong be done.         
	But, surely, the issue could have been handled better and a statement from the team management alone would have sufficed.         
	Apparently, Sehwag isnt too keen to open, preferring instead to bat in the middle-order, but Dhonis thinking is different.         
	For now, though, thats irrelevant as Sehwag hasnt recovered from a grade-I shoulder tear and wont be playing against Bangladesh.         
	Sehwag didnt bat during Fridays nets, but Zaheer Khan did bowl. Hes recovered from his shoulder problem, but its not certain that he will feature in Team Indias opener.         
	Match starts: 10.00 pm (IST).

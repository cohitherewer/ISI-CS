                                                   Bangla crumble as WI fight back
                            
	St Georges (Grenada): Bangladesh added 99 runs for the loss of four wickets Saturday, reaching 134 for five at lunch on the second day of the second Test against the West Indies.               
	At 12 am, Bangladesh were 185 for seven. Mushfiqur Rahim (24) and Mahmudullah (7) were at the crease               
	Raqibul Hasan was unbeaten on 32 while captain Shakib-al Hasan was 11 not out at the interval at the National Cricket Stadium.         
	Resuming on 35 for one in pursuit of the West Indies first-innings total of 237, Bangladesh batsmen struggled as the hosts produced a disciplined bowling display.         
	Fast bowler Kemar Roach, medium pacer David Bernard Jr., spinners Ryan Austin and Ryan Hinds claimed one wicket apiece.         
	Roach struck in the days fourth over when nightwatchman Enamul Haque Jr. was caught down the leg side for 13 after wicket-keeper Chadwick Walton clung onto a brilliant, two-handed catch.         
	Tamim Iqbal and Junaid Siddique added 24 for the third wicket before both fell in the space of two runs.         
	Tamim, after compiling 37 off 59 balls with six boundaries, nibbled outside the off stump and provided a third catch to Walton off Bernards swing bowling.         
	Austin struck with his first delivery as Siddique dragged the ball back onto his stumps for 7 to make it 77 for four.         
	Raqibul and Mohammed Ashraful took Bangladesh past 100, but the West Indies dismissed Ashraful 45 minutes before lunch.         
	Ashraful, who became only the second Bangladeshi to appear in 50 Tests, slapped a long hop from left-arm spinner Hinds straight to backward point. Raqibul moved to his highest Test score before the break, hitting two fours off 68 balls. Shakib had one boundary in 28 deliveries.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin: We need to value our strong spirit and unity
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sachin: We need to value our strong spirit and unity
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin Tendulkar                           
	Calcutta: It didnt come as a surprise that Sachin Tendulkar declined to comment on having taken the initiative for Team India to observe a minutes silence at the Green Park, on Thursday morning.         
	The inspirational multiple-record holder probably believes that, being the senior-most pro, he ought to be taking such initiatives and guiding the Mahendra Singh Dhonis.         
	Whatever, Sachin spoke to The Telegraph for around 10 minutes (from the team hotel in Kanpur) after the days play. Usually, he doesnt talk to the media at all during a match, unless requested to do so by the team management.         
	Sachin, an Indian first and then a Maharashtrian and Mumbaikar, chose to make an exception this one time, though.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Exactly a year after Mumbais 26/11         
	(Pauses) Its a time to recall the terrible experience the country went through... It wasnt an attack just on Mumbai... One feels the pain of the families who lost near and dear ones... A number of people have, over the past year, done their bit to fight terror... To ensure that something like 26/11 isnt repeated... Id like to avail of this opportunity and place on record my appreciation of their efforts... Its an emotional day.         
	On how he first heard of the terror strikes         
	It was in the dressing room, after the ODI (against England) in Cuttack... It was with shock that we watched one of the news channels... I called home as soon as I could and spoke to my immediate family... I did feel concerned... The family, too, was watching TV with disbelief... Actually, its very difficult describing what one felt.         
	Whether he and the other citizens are safer today than a year ago         
	Im no expert, but steps have been taken... Id like to believe that security has been strengthened, something which benefits the common man... I do feel that the security agencies and personnel are more on their toes now... Obviously, Im not privy to what is being done on a day to day basis, across the country, so I cant comment on the specifics... As Ive said, Im no expert, either.         
	If lessons have been learnt         
	Im not the competent person to answer this question...         
	Finally, his message for fellow-Indians         
	Weve always stuck together in a crisis... We should pray to God that 26/11 isnt repeated, but if something does happen again, then we must continue to show unity and a strong spirit... A crisis, especially, brings India together even more... We need to value our strong spirit and unity... As Ive told you, on a different occasion, Im the positive type and hate to criticise purely for the sake of criticising. As a country, we need to be confident.         
	Footnote: In the lead up to completing 20 years as an international cricketer, on November 15, Sachin had picked his unbeaten hundred (103) in the first Test after 26/11 (against England, in Chennai), last December, as his No.1 moment. The Shiv Sena, clearly, needs to take note.

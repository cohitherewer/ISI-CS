                                                     Bhutia has rule leeway 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bhaichung Bhutia                           
	New Delhi: An ambiguity in the players registration rules of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) may allow Bhaichung Bhutia to seek justice from the national body without routing his application through the Indian Football Association (IFA).         
	The AIFF officials, who are closely monitoring the situation but are not yet ready to publicly stick their necks out, feel there are ways through which the suspended footballer can fast track his case to the AIFF Players Status Committee.         
	There is some vagueness in the rules, said an official. Mohun Bagan and Bhaichung may be registered under the IFA but at the same time they are registered in the I-League.         
	And since the I-League is an AIFF property, a footballer in the professional league also remains directly registered with the federation. Under this rule, Bhaichung can try his luck by straightaway approaching the federation, the official said.         
	However, another official, who is certainly sympathetic to the Indian captain, thinks Bagan hold an upper hand on several counts.         
	To say Bhaichung is a free player is wrong. As per the available records, Bhaichung has a contract with the club till the 2009-2010 season. Since the IFA season has not begun, Bagan have not registered him. It doesnt mean the footballer is free. Bhaichung is definitely a professional player with Bagan.         
	The official also made it clear that it would be even more difficult for the ace striker to get a release from Bagan.         
	In this case, Bagan can have the last laugh. A professional footballer, even if he is more than 28 years old and has only one year left on his existing contract, needs the clubs permission to join another club.         
	The rule in this case is very clear. Otherwise, Beto would have walked over to East Bengal. Bagan, if they want to, can keep Bhaichung till the end of the season. An amicable settlement is the only solution, said the official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lucky to restrict Pak, says Ricky
                                                   Lucky to restrict Pak, says Ricky
                      
	Centurion: Australia captain Ricky Ponting lavished praise on Pakistan bowlers for making life difficult for his batsmen and said they were lucky to have restricted their rivals at a low score here Wednesday.         
	Australia pulled off a last-ball win against Pakistan to reach the last four stage of the Champions Trophy and Ponting said they would have to do some soul-searching before they take on England in the second semi-final on Friday.         
	It was quite emotional and chilling to sit there in the dressing room and it really got too close. But we have crossed the line and we will meet England in the semi-finals in a couple of days time, he said.         
	We had a very good series against England over there but its different conditions here and I think they are playing really good cricket. We have to go back to the drawing board and see what went wrong in the last half an hour, he added.

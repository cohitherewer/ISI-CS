The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Managers report tomorrow
                                                   Managers report tomorrow
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The managers report on the spat between Ranadeb Bose and Ashok Dinda was not submitted to the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) as scheduled on Saturday and would now be tabled on Monday.         
	The spat took place on the eve of Bengals semi-final against Baroda in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, in Agartala.         
	The CAB joint secretary Arun Mitra on Saturday said that he had asked Debabrata Das, the manager of the Bengal team, to submit a hard copy of his report on Monday.         
	When asked whether any special committee would be formed to probe the issue, Mitra replied in the negative. After the report is submitted, I will hand it over directly to president Jagmohan Dalmiya, he said.         
	I dont think any decision on the matter will be taken soon as both the players are playing for the East Zone in the Deodhar Trophy in Cuttack. A decision will be taken only after they return.

                                                   Derek not to try out Paul 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The citys football lovers will have to wait before they can see Subrata Paul, Indias best goalkeeper, in action this season.         
	Pune FC coach Derek Pereira said Thursday that he would not field Subrata in the teams last match in the IFA Shield on Saturday, against AS Douanes of Senegal.         
	Were already out of the tournament, and the guy has been playing his heart out for India for the last few days. So hes obviously tired. Playing him wont make any sense, Derek said.         
	The pain of having to leave the city where he grew up as a footballer was writ large on Subratas face when he came to the Mohun Bagan ground with the team on Thursday. But he is determined to do well for the club, a thing he has not been able to do in the last few seasons.         
	After the practice session, Subrata said: Leaving this city is painful but Ill give everything to my new club.

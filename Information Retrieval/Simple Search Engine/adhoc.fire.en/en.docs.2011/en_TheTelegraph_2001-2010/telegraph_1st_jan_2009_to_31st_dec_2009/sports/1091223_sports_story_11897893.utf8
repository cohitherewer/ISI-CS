                                                                                                                       7                                        Gayle forgives Watson
                  Gayle                     
	Melbourne: West Indies captain Chris Gayle said he has forgiven Australian all-rounder Shane Watson for his wild celebration in the Perth Test even though Watson has no remorse for the behaviour which cost him 15 per cent of his match fee.         
	Watson was cock-a-hoop after getting Gayle in the second innings of the acrimonious Perth, Test and the Australian broke into a wild, prolonged celebration that miffed, among others, Match Referee Chris Broad, who fined him.         
	In an article titled Shane, I will forgive you in a local newspaper  Gayle said he held no grudge against Watson. There is no doubt he over-reacted, but Im prepared to move on and let bygones be bygones, wrote Gayle.         
	The flamboyant West Indian said the Australians kept commenting on the field but he was proud the way his teammates fought against all the odds.         
	There was certainly a lot of talk and a lot of niggles from Australian players in Perth. They played us really hard. It is never going to be easy taking on the Australians, but I was proud of the way we stood up to be counted, Gayle said.         
	On Watsons behaviour, Gayle said: Watson is an interesting individual but, on reflection, I am prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt for the send-off he gave me in Perth.

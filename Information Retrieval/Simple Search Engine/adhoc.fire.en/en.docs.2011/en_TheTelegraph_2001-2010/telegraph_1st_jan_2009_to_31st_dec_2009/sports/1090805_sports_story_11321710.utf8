The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ecclestone thrilled by Schumi comeback
                                                   Ecclestone thrilled by Schumi comeback
                      
	London: Seven-time world champion Michael Schumachers return to Ferrari will be an education for some Formula One rivals, Bernie Ecclestone said on Tuesday.         
	I think hes going to give one or two of them a driving lesson, the F1 supremo told a news conference.         
	The 40-year-old German is poised to return to the track at the European Grand Prix in Valencia on August 23 in place of Ferraris injured driver Felipe Massa.         
	The Brazilian is recovering from a fractured skull after being hit by a bouncing spring before crashing during qualifying for the Hungary Grand Prix in July.         
	He obviously wouldnt have decided to come back unless he thought he was going to be competitive and Michael is a competitive guy, Ecclestone added.         
	The surprise return of F1s most successful driver, who retired at the end of 2006, has been hailed by motor sport fans and will provide intrigue ahead of the race in Spain.         
	His comeback will see McLarens current world champion Lewis Hamilton, as well as Red Bulls title contender Sebastien Vettel  nicknamed Baby Schumi by his compatriots  race for the first time against the man who dominated the sport for a decade.         
	Hes always been super popular even though he won too many races and people said he was boring. He was never boring and he wont be boring now, Ecclestone said.         
	I think I was just as surprised as Willi Weber  his manager  he didnt know he was coming back (either). I think it was (Ferrari president) Luca di Montezemolo that convinced him.         
	Meanwhile, Ecclestone said motor racings premier sport will return to Montreal next season.         
	The Grand Prix du Canada was taken off the F1 calendar this year after a contractual dispute.         
	But Ecclestone said well be driving in Montreal again in 2010. Ecclestone also ruled out a return to Indianapolis, which last hosted an F1 race in 2007.           (REUTERS)

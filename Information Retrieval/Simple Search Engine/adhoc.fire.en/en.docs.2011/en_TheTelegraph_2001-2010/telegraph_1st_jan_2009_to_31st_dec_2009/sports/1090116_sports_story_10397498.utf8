The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Colts whip Britain to make final
                                                   Colts whip Britain to make final
                      
	Sydney: The Indian boys hockey team continued their rampaging form, trouncing Great Britain 6-1 in the second league match of the Australian Youth Olympic Festival (AYOF) at the Olympic Hockey Centre here to book their berth in the final of the four-nation tournament.         
	However, the girls team lost their second successive match Thursday, and that dashed any hopes of them progressing to the title round.         
	The girls had gone down 1-3 to Great Britain Wednesday and suffered a 2-3 defeat to Australia Thursday.         
	In the under-21 mens encounter, skipper Diwakar Ram (7th and 16th minutes) was at his best with the dragflicks while striker Pramod Kumar (38th, 46th) too joined the party along with Danish Mujtaba (26th) and Jaykaran (66th).         
	The British started with vigour but as the game wore on, India wrested the initiative and an early goal opened the floodgates.         
	Diwakar made no mistake in handing India the lead with a perfect dragflick from a short corner. Great Britain tried to claw their way back into the game but India managed to thwart their counter attacks.         
	At the opposite end, had it not been for British goalkeeper Ian Scanlon, who blocked several attempts in the first half, Indias margin of victory could have been bigger.         
	Despite Scanlons heroics, Diwakar doubled the lead with his second in the 16th minute following a penalty stroke. (PTI)

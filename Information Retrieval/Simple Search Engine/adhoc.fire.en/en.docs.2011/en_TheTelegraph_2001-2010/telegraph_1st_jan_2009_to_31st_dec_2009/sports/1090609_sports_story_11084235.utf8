	Nottingham: Around 70 pro-Tamil protestors parked themselves outside Trent Bridge before the Sri Lanka-Australia match got under way.         
	According to a statement issued by the Nottinghamshire Police, security personnel facilitated the lawful protest.         
	Such protests, related to recent happenings in Sri Lanka, could well get bigger as the World T20 moves towards the next stage.         
	Never before has the Sri Lankan team been given the level of security put in place this time, a top source told The Telegraph on Monday.

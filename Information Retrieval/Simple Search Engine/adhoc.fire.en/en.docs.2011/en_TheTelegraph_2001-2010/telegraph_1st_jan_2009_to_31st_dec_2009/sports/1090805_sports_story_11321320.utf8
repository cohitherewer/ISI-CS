	Calcutta: Samar Banerjee, captain of the Indian football team at the 1956 Olympics, and nine of his teammates have decided to return their grant of Rs 25,000 each from the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to the football body calling it an insult.         
	This is a big insult for us. We have never asked for any kind of grant from anybody, Banerjee, who was accompanied by Nikhil Kumar Nandy and Tulsidas Balaram said Tuesday.         
	We never expected this kind of reception from the AIFF We played for our nation and dont want any kind of grant from them for that We have self-respect we are not beggars. The nine of us have decided to sent the cheques back to the AIFF along with a letter of protest, Banerjee added.         
	Of the 18-member team for the Melbourne Olympics, only nine, who are alive, have received the AIFF grant in July.         
	Besides Banerjee, Nandy and Balaram, P.K. Banerjee and Krishna Chandra Pal are the other members of that team from the city. S.S. Narayan, Mohammed Abdus Salam, Ahmed Hussain, Mohammed Zulfiqaruddin are the remaining four.         
	The former captain said that he had advised the AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco to follow the cricket Boards way and arrange a pension-scheme for the former footballers.

                                                   WI make steady progress
                      
	Kingstown: Opener Omar Phillips hit an unbeaten 71 on his debut as the West Indies made sound progress Saturday to reach 136 for two on the third day of the opening cricket Test against Bangladesh at Arnos Vale.         
	The 22-year-old left-hander struck five fours off 139 balls in a polished display that guided the home team to 136 for two at lunch in reply to Bangladeshs modest first-innings total of 238.         
	Nightwatchman Ryan Austin contributed a defiant 17 in a second-wicket stand of 79.         
	Travis Dowlin, making his Test debut along with Austin and Phillips, made an enterprising 22 not out before the break. The diminutive right-hander cracked four fours off 38 balls.         
	Rubel Hossain, another debutant, claimed the only scalp for the visitors when Austin nicked to first slip where Imrul Kayes held a low catch. The 19-year-old fast bowler took one for 30.         
	Bangladesh were handicapped in the first half hour when captain and main fast bowler Mashrafe Mortaza limped off after injuring his right knee on a follow through. Team officials said Mortaza had exacerbated a previous injury and would not return to the field on Saturday.

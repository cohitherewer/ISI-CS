	Chennai: Somdev Dev Varman produced a masterclass of tactical tennis as he shocked world No.25 Ivo Karlovic of Croatia 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 to storm into the singles semi-finals of the Chennai Open on Friday.         
	If on Thursday the 23-year-old Somdev had displayed grit in conquering former world No.1 Carlos Moya, the rising Indian star tamed Karlovic with a display of solid baseline game to record perhaps the best win of his career.         
	At 610, Karlovic is the tallest player on the ATP Tour. But apart from delivering booming serves, the Giant from Salata doesnt seem to do much else with his height. He is not the quickest mover on court, nor does he have the softest of hands at the net. In a nutshell, to paraphrase Shane Warne, he cant bend, cant move, cant play.         
	And Somdev, who had beaten 69 John Isner to win his first NCAA title two years ago, thoroughly exposed his opponents limitations. Whether it was drawing Karlovic up to the net and passing him on both flanks, or beating him with drop shots and bootlace returns, Somdev played out a copybook game.         
	The result has Somdev emulating Leander Paes on another landmark. It was 10 years ago when Paes reached the last-four stage of the tournament. Then, Paes ran into a wall called Patrick Rafter. Similarly, Somdev faces Rainer Schuettler. The German, a former world No.5, could prove to be a tougher nut to crack .         
	For sure, the Chennai fans have not had a champion player to cheer in a long time. And the couple of thousand that came to the Nungambakkam stadium got their moneys worth on Friday.         
	Somdev was aware that against a big serving rival, he had to first hold his own serve before inflicting any damage. So, he kept up with Karlovic in the first set and struck when the first chance came in the tie-break.         
	An effortless lob that caught Karlovic on the wrong foot gave Somdev the crucial break and he built on it to take a 3-0 lead in the tiebreak. From there on, given the Indians solid baseline game, Karlovic had no chance of a comeback.         
	As the match wore on, it was clear that Karlovic was struggling to find an answer to Somdevs ground strokes. The first match point came when a forehand to the far corner left Karlovic gasping for breath in the 10th game. It was 30-40.         
	The Croat saved that with a service winner but Somdev was not to be denied. He created another breakpoint with a typical cross-court winner for advantage. Karlovic then obliged by hitting a forehand long.         
	German Schuettler overwhelmed his compatriot Bjorn Phau 6-2, 7-5 in another quarter final.         
	Another Croatian Marin Cilic, kept himself on course for the title after avoiding a slip-up against Serbian Janko Tipseravic to win 6-4, 0-6, 6-4. He will meet Marcel Granollers of Spain, who defeated Lukas Dlouhy of the Czech Republic 7-5, 2-6, 6-4, in the other semi-final.         
	But Somdevs win was dampened by the shock 6-3, 3-6, 8-10 defeat of doubles top seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles to the Swiss pairing of Stanislas Wawrinka and Jean-Claude Scherrer in a late evening match.

  - I-league
  -  Churchill Brothers ecstatic as Mohammedan Sporting look for scapegoats         OUR CORRESPONDENT                
	Margao: For Churchill Brothers players and officials, the maiden I-League title might have been just a dream come true. But for one man, it was a little more than that.         
	For coach Zoran Djordjevic, a god-fearing Serbian, the triumph meant victory of good over the evil.         
	I never do anything wrong. I do my best to help Indian football. But there are some who offer money, they make tricks. The corruption is evident, they are gangsters who should be sent to jail. But today we beat them all, an emotional Djordjevic said after the 6-2 win over Mohammedan Sporting.         
	It doesnt need much detailing to figure out what Djordjevic, who was animated on the sidelines and gesturing to the cameras well before the match had come to an end, was saying.         
	Allegations of fixing and deliberate under-performance is not new, and it is strongly believed in Varca, the home town of the new I-League champions, that Mohun Bagans 2-1 win over Dempo last weekend was one such result.         
	It may also be recalled that Mohun Bagan had offered Mohammedan Sporting a prize of Rs 5 lakh if they beat Churchill.         
	But Djordjevic declined to make a direct comment. Am just a coach, what can I do? It is they who have to be ashamed, is all that he would say.         
	But the players themselves are not bothered about such issues.         
	I am happy my dream has come true finally. We were looking forward to this match right from the start of the week. This victory is for the players and the family (of Churchill Alemao), Odafe, the Leagues top scorer with 26 goals, told The Telegraph.         
	We were very confident that we would win against Mohammedan Sporting, and that Mahindra (United) would win against Bagan as well, the 24-year-old Nigerian said.

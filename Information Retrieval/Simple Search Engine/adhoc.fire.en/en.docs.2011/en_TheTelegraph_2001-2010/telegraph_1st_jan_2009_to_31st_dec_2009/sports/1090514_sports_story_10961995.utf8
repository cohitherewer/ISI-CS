The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hayden is a genius, says Sreesanth
                                                   Hayden is a genius, says Sreesanth
                      
	Johannesburg: Temperamental pacer Sreesanth has said he considers Matthew Hayden a genius and does not know what prompted the belligerent Australian to call him an over-rated bowler.         
	During the May 7 Indian Premier League match between Chennai Super Kings and Kings XI Punjab in Pretoria, the Australian spanked the Indian pacer for two sixes before falling to him in the same over.         
	At the subsequent press conference, Hayden alleged Sreesanth had sledged him and said the Kerala pacer was an over-rated bowler.         
	Sreesanth denied sledging the Australian and was clueless what prompted Hayden to say so.         
	I came to know from my friends in Bangalore (that) I have been called an over-rated bowler by Hayden. I dont even know why he said that, Sreesanth said.         
	Even my friends were asking me what I said about it. I said I dont have anything to say... He is a genius, genuine great batsman, the greatest batsman in the world. I have nothing to say on that, he said. (PTI)

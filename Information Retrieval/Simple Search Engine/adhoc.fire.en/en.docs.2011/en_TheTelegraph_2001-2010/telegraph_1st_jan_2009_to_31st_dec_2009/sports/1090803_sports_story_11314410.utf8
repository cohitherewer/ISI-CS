	Mainz: World champion Viswanathan Anand has bowed out of contention for a top place in the Grenkeleasing World Rapid Chess championship after being eliminated in the preliminary round.         
	Having lost two of the first three games, Anand needed exceptional results with some luck to make it to the finals and even though he tried hard, the lady luck did not smile on the world champion.         
	The 11-time winner here, Anand scored 2.5 points in all after drawing all the three games in the return games of the prelims and finished third while the top place went to Levon Aronian of Armenia and Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia finished second. Arkadij Naiditsch of Germany finished at the bottom of the tables in the prelims.         
	I think the two people who deserved to qualify, qualified. Thats life. If you play badly you get punished, Anand said in the press conference. The Indian will now play Naiditsch in the third place play-off late on Tuesday.

	Chandigarh: India conceded a goal in the dying minutes to lose 1-2 in the final of the Punjab Gold Cup hockey tournament against European champions Holland here Monday.         
	Tournament top-scorer Jeroen Hertzberger converted a penalty corner in the 66th minute to dash Indian hopes in the final played under lights in a packed Sector 42 hockey stadium.         
	After a barren first half, it was India who took the lead in the 43rd minute. The hosts were awarded a penalty stroke following an unfair tackle by Wouter Jolie on striker Shivender Singh inside the striking circle.         
	Skipper Sandeep Singh, who had failed to convert from the spot against the Dutch in the group league stage, made no mistake this time as his low hit beat the Dutch goalkeeper, Jaap Stockmann. The visitors equalised within three minutes when Robbert Kempermans deflection beat India goalkeeper Baljit Singh.         
	India tried hard to find the winning goal  their hunt yielding five penalty corners  but to no avail, as Hertzbergers sixth goal of the tournament left them high and dry.         
	India earned their first penalty corner in the fifth minute, but Sandeeps powerful hit was saved by Stockmann.         
	The hosts came close to opening their account in the 19th minute but striker Tushar Khandekars diagonal pass to Shivender missed the goal by inches.         
	Holland earned their first penalty corner in the 20th minute, but goalkeeper Baljit once again rose to the occasion to block the powerful shot. The Indian defence came in for some tough time late in the first half from the Dutch strike pair of Hertzberger and Lucas Judge, but Baljit kept them at bay.         
	India got yet another chance to forge ahead at the stroke of halftime when Shivender led an attack from the right flank. However, Rajpal failed to trap the ball inside the striking circle and the chance went begging.         
	The Dutch, who were held 4-4 and 2-2 by India in the group league stage, took a victory lap after the final hooter.         
	New Zealand striker Joel Baker struck in the last minute of the match to help his team shock world champions Germany 3-2 in the play-off and finish third.         
	Both the teams were locked 2-2 till the dying minutes of the match but Baker scored the winner to carve out a memorable win for his team.         
	The New Zealanders, ranked as low as seven, did not win a single match in the league stages.

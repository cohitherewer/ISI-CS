The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Difficult to come back from 27/5, says Dhoni
                                                                                                                                     Difficult to come back from 27/5, says Dhoni
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Ravindra Jadeja after reaching his 50 Sunday                           
	Guwahati: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni had been looking forward to a good start in Sundays crunch game against Australia to keep the series alive. But that was not to be. Dhoni admitted in the post-match press conference that it was difficult to stage a comeback after they were reduced to 27 for five in 5.1 overs.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Sundays loss         
	Everything happened too fast. In the first over, we lost a couple of wickets. There is not much you can do about it. You need your experienced guys to be in the middle. There is no use altering the batting order too much.         
	On ground and pitch conditions         
	Quite good But of course it is not quite as good as Mohali or Nagpur. But there is nothing to complain about. The wicket played superbly. . We knew the first half- hour will be crucial and, I thought that if we negotiate that well, we can always set the total we have in mind.         
	Thoughts after being reduced to 27 for five         
	It was a bit too much. Even if it was the loss of one or two wickets, we could have probably fought back because we had the seventh batsmen. We have also seen Praveen (Kumar) and Harbhajan (Singh) contributing with the bat. But once you are 27 for five, it is difficult to come back in the game. Even 150 was looking difficult. We are fortunate to have scored 170. The early wickets cost us dear.         
	On the umpires decision which led to his dismissal         
	Disappointing But then it is part and parcel of the game. I dont know how much difference it would have made.         
	What went wrong in the series         
	We are lacking consistency in our batting and have done well in patches in this series. We have not grabbed the opportunities that have come our way. We often didnt get off to a good start. And when we didnt, even the middle order had failed. I wont blame the bowlers too much because the conditions were favourable for the batsmen. We were lacking in batting.         
	Losing out on the No. 1 spot         
	You have to win games to be the No. 1 side. I think losing the series says everything.

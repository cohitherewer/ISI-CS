The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saina Nehwal goes down fighting to second seed
                                                     Saina Nehwal goes down fighting to second seed
            SHARMISTHA CHAUDHURI    
	Hyderabad: She recovered in time, she battled but she failed to conquer. Saina Nehwal bowed out of the World Badminton Championships after she lost to second seed Lin Wang of China whom she had defeated just a month-and-a-half ago to win her maiden super series tournament in Jakarta.         
	Lin had ample time to prepare and she played really well, was the first thing Saina said after her 16-21, 19-21 quarter final loss Friday.         
	The match could have gone either way. I made some simple mistakes, which I never imagined I would. It was a very good fight, the 19-year-old added.         
	Saina kept her guard up throughout the match but unfortunately, couldnt resist the determined Chineses smashes and fabulous net play. Lin didnt wait for an opportunity to be handed to her; she went for her shots from the start and raced away to an incredible lead.         
	Not to be outdone, Saina kept her chin up and pulled level at 11-11. No matter what Saina tried, long rallies or smashes, Lin never let the world No.6 get ahead in the first game. Smart tactics and powerful net play helped Lin win the first game 21-16.         
	Her net play was just too good. I did dribble but Lin attacked straight from the net, almost never giving me a chance. Unlike the Indonesia Open final, she wasnt lifting the shuttle something that had allowed me to take advantage, said the Beijing Olympics quarter finalist.         
	I did go in front in the second game though, she added. Despite a service error on the first point, Saina pulled up her socks and cut down on unforced errors to lead 10-2. But Lin wasnt prepared to give up that easily. She won an incredible eight points to even the scores. However, had Saina not made silly errors at crucial moments, maybe the game would have gone to the final game.         
	Till 18-18, Saina always remained in the lead but two brilliant net plays suddenly saw the Indian two match points down. But never-say-die was Sainas motto as she smashed to save one crucial point. But in the end, the match finished the way the Chinese had scripted.         
	It was her good day today. But when two top-10 players meet, its always the one who plays better on the day that wins. And thats what happened here, Saina added.         
	This World Championships has been incredible for me. In 2007 I had only reached the pre-quarters and this year the quarters. I beat the 10th seed and almost defeated another seed.         
	Lin was the better player. She picked up all my smashes, she said. I could have easily gone till the final game. A win would have been incredible but thats how it goes.         
	Pullela Gopichand, the former All-England champion, said: Im very happy with the way Saina has played. Just a week after recovery (from chicken pox), its incredible the way she put up a fight.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Prasanna Jayawardene en route to his unbeaten 84 in Ahmedabad on Wednesday. (AFP)                           
	Ahmedabad: Mahela Jayawardene feels that if the bowlers can put India under pressure it will open up opportunities for Sri Lanka as they pursue their first Test win on Indian soil.         
	The former captain described his unbeaten 204 as commendable at a news conference on Wednesday.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On becoming more consistent         
	With the captaincy had come a bit more responsibility. After playing for so many years, I have realised what my strengths and weaknesses are and how to build an innings. Even before that I was doing the right things, but making too many mistakes. Maybe with maturity, you realise how to pace your innings.         
	How he rates his knock         
	Given the situation and that it came against India in India was commendable. I was determined to get my first hundred here         
	If the groundwork for a win has been done         
	When we came here, we had a very realistic plan of beating India, given the way we have been playing Test cricket over the last two-three years. So that was one of our goals We were disappointed to let India get away after the excellent start we had on the first day. But they did bat well. Rahul Dravid, in particular, and Mahendra Singh Dhoni. We still knew the wicket was good and (Tillekaratne) Dilshan batted superbly, giving us the momentum. He took on the two spinners and we havent let it slip. If we can build a good lead, we can create opportunities.         
	On Prasannas innings         
	We worked on a few things against different bowlers. He batted well today. He has the ability, but its just applying yourself out there that is important. Hes got a lot of talent and he showed what hes capable of today.         
	Indias bowling         
	You should probably ask them! It was very hot out there. We knew if we could grind them, the effort would pay off.         
	If India had bowled negatively         
	They were trying to not give us a big lead today. You can even pick up wickets in that manner. We didnt play too many shots and we played the way we wanted to play. The teams use different tactics and you have to adjust accordingly.         
	Declaration         
	We will see how it goes... (Captain) Kumar Sangakkara and the team management will have to decide on that.         
	The wicket         
	You never know Anything can happen on the fourth and fifth days They (India) are under pressure and that can create opportunities. We have handled the wicket pretty well. But if they lose too many wickets quickly, it will be a different ball game.         
	The tactics now         
	As on any Test wicket, the deterioration will be there and we will see whether we can take advantage of that.         
	Muralis condition         
	Hes fine. He was speaking a lot in the dressing room, which means hes okay.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gayle, Sarwan centuries boost WI
                                                   Gayle, Sarwan centuries boost WI
                      
	Kingston: Two wickets by Stuart Broad shortly before lunch gave England much-needed encouragement after a Friday morning session dominated by centuries from West Indies batsmen Chris Gayle and Ramnaresh Sarwan.         
	West Indies were 224 for three at the interval on the third day in response to Englands 318.         
	While Gayle made 104, Sarwan was unbeaten on 103.         
	Resuming on 160 for one, Gayle and Sarwan carried on as they had left off, batting with authority and attention against a fiery Andrew Flintoff and keeping the run-rate ticking along nicely against Englands other bowlers.         
	Captain Gayle brought up his ninth Test century, and his first on his home ground of Sabina Park, in majestic style.         
	On Thursday, Gayle and Sarwans unbeaten 142-run partnership for the West Indies against England on Thursday came as a vital lift for two men shouldered with the responsibility of taking the fight to the tourists.         
	Skipper Gayle had been without a century for three years until his 197 in a drawn Test against New Zealand in December and he picked up where he left off with an unbeaten 71 on a slow track.         
	Sarwan had a disappointing time in New Zealand, where he managed just 21 runs in three innings over the two Tests, but appeared to have rediscovered his touch by building a stylish 74 before the close.         
	Throughout the past year, the West Indies have been over-reliant on the dependable Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who too often has come in to bat in tricky situations or has been left without support.         
	Sarwan and Gayle are regarded as the two other world class players in the batting line-up and they carried that responsibility well against a tame England attack.         
	While there is an air of predictability about the little Guyana right-handers return to form  few ever doubted that the lack of runs was but a blip for a man who averages 39.8 in Tests  there appears to be a more significant change in Gayles batting.         
	In his near double-century in Napier, Gayle batted with the kind of disciplined responsibility that his critics have maintained was lacking from his hard-hitting approach which often saw him dismissed with loose strokes.         
	The more-careful Gayle was in evidence again and even though he hit three sixes, he was more circumspect in his shot selection.           (REUTERS)

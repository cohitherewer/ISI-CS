The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barcelona coach not taking Bayern lightly
                                                   Barcelona coach not taking Bayern lightly
                      
	Berlin: Barcelona take a 4-0 advantage to Munich but are wary of Bayerns wounded pride when they face the Germans on Tuesday in their Champions League quarter final return leg.         
	Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola warned their high-scoring victory in Spain last week could bring the best out of the German champions, who have called the defeat a debacle and said they have no real chance of qualifying.         
	Bayern are capable of scoring four goals, all the more so when they are wounded, Guardiola said at a news conference. I dont believe the statements about them already having given the tie up for lost, he said.         
	I am sure they will put in a good performance and we have to go there with a lot of ambition to win the match. If we are speculative they will roll over us.         
	Guardiola left key players, including midfielder Xavi, Primera Liga top-scorer Samuel Eto and captain Carles Puyol, out of his starting line-up for Saturdays comfortable 2-0 home win over struggling Recreativo Huelva.         
	The former Barcelona and Spain midfielder will have to watch the match from the stands after being dismissed from the bench in the first leg and then seeing his appeal with Uefa rejected. Ill be in the stands but it does not matter, it is something completely secondary, he said.         
	Barcelona central defender Rafael Marquez is suspended after picking up a yellow card at the Camp Nou.         
	Bayern, who had not lost in the Champions League this season before last weeks defeat, have said the team has an obligation to restore the clubs pride.         
	Boosted by their 4-0 crushing of Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday, the Germans are looking to bow out with their heads held high.         
	With this win (against Frankfurt) we repaired part of the damage but not all of it. We have a lot to do on Tuesday so that we can say goodbye to the competition in a good way, coach Juergen Klinsmann said.         
	Klinsmann is again expected to field 34-year-old keeper Hans Joerg Butt, ahead of Michael Rensing, who had been his first choice throughout the season until last week.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Not under pressure, says Viru
                                                                                                                       7                                      Not under pressure, says Viru
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Cuttack: Stand-in Virender Sehwag conceded on Sunday that its difficult to contain an in-form player like Tillekaratne Dilshan. The only way to stop him is to get him out early, Sehwag said at a press conference.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The Dhoni factor         
	Obviously, its a huge blow He is our best middle-order batsman.         
	The pressure of sitting in the hot seat         
	There is no pressure on me. I have been a part of the team for the last nine years. I am aware about whats going on... So its not that difficult.         
	Expectations from Dinesh Karthik         
	He has done well in whatever little chances he has got. He is a good prospect and we expect him to do well.         
	On Dilshan         
	Obviously when someone bats in the form Dilshan is batting at the moment, bowlers will find it difficult to contain him. The only way to stop him is to get him out. Its like Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar batting When they are batting well, its difficult for the bowlers to stop the flow of runs.         
	The issue of slow over-rates         
	Nothing much... Ive told the bowlers that they have to complete 50 overs in three-and-half hours.         
	The toss         
	The toss will be important as dew will play its role. I guess bowling first wont be a bad option.         
	ODI pitches turning into bowlers graveyards         
	I would like to put it in a different perspective. The batsmen have started devising new techniques to attack the bowlers. Now the batsmen feel that they can chase down any total.         
	Whether Mike Young has been able to make an impact         
	Mike is a good coach. He has taught us some innovative drills. When you try and adapt a new system it does take some time. I am sure that we will get better with the passage of time though fielding remains an area of concern.

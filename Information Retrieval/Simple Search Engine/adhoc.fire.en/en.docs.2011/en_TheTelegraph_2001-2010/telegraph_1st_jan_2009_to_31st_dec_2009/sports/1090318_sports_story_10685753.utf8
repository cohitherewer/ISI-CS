                                                   Knight Riders scrap tour
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders have scrapped their plans of a preparatory tour to Bangladesh amid uncertainty reigning over the second edition of the Indian Premier League.         
	The team had planned to play some practice matches in Bangladesh as part of their preparations for the forthcoming season of the IPL.         
	The recent attack on the Sri Lankan cricketers in Pakistan, coupled with the disturbed political scenario in Bangladesh, have forced the KKR officials to decide scrap the tour.         
	Touring Bangladesh was never finalised as the plans were tentative. But in the present circumstances it would be better if we didnt tour Bangladesh.         
	We are not closing our doors on Bangladesh forever. May be something will materialise in the future, a KKR official said.         
	The teams five-day preparatory camp at the Eden kicked off on Tuesday with around 28 fringe players.         
	More players will be joining the camp after the Deodhar Trophy final gets over in Cuttack on Wednesday.

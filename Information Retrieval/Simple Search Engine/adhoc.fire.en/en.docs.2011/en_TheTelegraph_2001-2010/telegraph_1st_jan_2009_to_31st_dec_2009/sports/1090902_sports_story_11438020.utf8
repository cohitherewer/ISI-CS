                                                     Chirag, TFA in dull draw
  - Joshimar misses penalty; Violence mars George tie       A STAFF REPORTER            Subodh Kumar on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: It couldnt get any worse. Chirag United and the Tata Football Academy played out 90 minutes of dull, drab and uninspiring football to finish tied 1-1 in an IFA Shield group A match at the Mohun Bagan ground Tuesday.         
	The September humidity made it all the more difficult for the sparse crowd that waited in vain for the young guns of TFA and the Big Two rejects to give them something to cheer about.         
	After 45 minutes of mindless and aimless football, TFA shot into the lead two minutes into the second half. Skipper Subodh Kumar put his team ahead with a right-footed free kick that nestled into the net leaving Chirag goalkeeper Sandip Nandy rooted to the spot.         
	Stung by the reverse, Chirag started showing more purpose venturing into the rival area. The equaliser, however, came courtesy a defensive lapse. Defender Gurjinder Singh had no business chesting down an innocuous Lalkamal Bhowmick centre as TFA goalkeeper Ishan Debnath looked all set to gather it. Shylo Lalsawmtluanga, who was lurking nearby, pounced on the blunder and slotted home to restore parity.         
	In the first half Chirags Brazilian recruit, Joshimar muffed a penalty. Five minutes from half time, Joshimar was brought down inside the box by defender Hardeep Singh. However, the Brazilians feeble shot was saved by the young Ishan.         
	 For Chirag, Eduardo Coelho, who plied his trade for Mohun Bagan some seasons back, was impressive and it was because of him that the likes of Robin Singh and Jagtar Singh did not find even an inch of space.         
	On Wednesday, Mohammedan Sporting are taking on Churchill Brothers at the Mohun Bagan ground, while Senegals AS Douanes meet AIr India. Mohammedan Sporting defender Peter Odafe who has a slight niggle, es expected to make the cut.

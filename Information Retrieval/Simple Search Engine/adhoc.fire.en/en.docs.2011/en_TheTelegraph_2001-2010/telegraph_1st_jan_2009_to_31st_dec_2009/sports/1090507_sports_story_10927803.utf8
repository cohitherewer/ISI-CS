                                                   Practice on Test strip helped, feels Smith
            A STAFF REPORTER                       
	Calcutta: Rajasthan Royals opener Graeme Smith, who cracked a 44-ball 77 to lay the foundation for his teams 78-run win over the Kings XI Punjab Tuesday, said he practised on a Test strip to prepare for the match.         
	I have been working hard at the nets. And today, we actually got a Test strip to bat on. So, that was one thing which went in my favour as I was feeling a lot more comfortable on the wicket, the South Afrcian captain said.         
	I think I was a little tense during the initial matches but I have settled down. Now, I have some confidence going. I played my natural game yesterday. And I am very happy that we won the match, he was quoted as saying in the IPL website.         
	With Rajasthan placed at No. 3 on the points table, Smith said his new found confidence will help his team to make it to the final four.         
	No, I did not want to set a score for myself. I just wanted to be positive today. I just wanted to be myself on the field. Hopefully, I can use the confidence in the coming matches to help my side secure a semi-final berth, he said.         
	The left-handed South African also lavished praise on his opening partner Naman Ojha.         
	Naman Ojha was awesome. He allowed me to play some positive cricket. It was great to have a good opening partnership in the match. Our top-order has struggled, so it feels good to make the amends, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Villegas gets the better of Jeev 
                                                   Villegas gets the better of Jeev 
                      
	Casares: Lee Westwood, Camilo Villegas, Henrik Stenson and Rory McIlroy maintained their chances of reaching the World Match Play Championship semi-finals with wins Friday.         
	Westwood beat Ross Fisher by two holes and Villegas defeated Jeev Milkha Singh 3 up at the Finca Cortesin golf club. All four players in group D have two points. Group C also has four players with two points from two matches after Stenson held off former Masters champion Angel Cabrera 2 up, while McIlroy kept his chances alive with a two-hole victory over Simon Dyson. Cabrera, who leads Group C on hole difference, can qualify for the semi-finals with a win over Dyson later Friday. Singh leads group D by the same three-hole advantage and can play Saturday by beating Fisher.         
	American player Anthony Kim only needs to halve his match with Scott Strange later Friday to win group A. Retief Goosen will need a big win over the already eliminated Paul Casey to maintain his hopes of advancing.

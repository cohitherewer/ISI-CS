                                                     Jai ho at Trent Bridge
  - Ojhas was actually an inspired selection       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Pragyan Ojha                                 
	Nottingham: After parading their unity, Team India put on show their awesome might, at Trent Bridge, on Saturday. The heat was felt by Bangladesh, but the performance also warmed thousands braving the chill.         
	Long after the last ball had been bowled, one could hear shouts of jai ho in the vicinity of Trent Bridge and four-wheelers packed with fans kept blaring Punjabi hits.         
	The defending champions emphatic 25-run win in the World T20, in fact, was the talking point on Sunday afternoon too, especially at the annual Nottingham Mela, organised by the around 6,000-strong Indian community at the Old Market Square.         
	Zabardast cricket, is what one heard as chola-bhaturas, jalebis and dosas kept disappearing from the makeshift stalls. One didnt spot anybody from Bangladesh, though, perhaps because of Saturdays result.         
	Among other things, the match proved that one over alone in each innings may make all the difference.         
	The batsmen, in particular, just keptcoming at us... The Indians had so much firepower, conceded the Bangladesh coach, Jamie Siddons.         
	Yuvraj Singh did most of the damage, lashing 41 off only 18 balls, an innings which included 19 off one over, and then T20 debutant Pragyan Ojha returned MoM award-winning figures of four for 21.         
	Ojhas was actually an inspired selection, as conditions were overcast and conventional wisdom suggested there would be place for just one specialist spinner  Harbhajan Singh.         
	You feel like doing certain things and you go ahead... Wed been looking to play Ojha as hed bowled very well in the IPL, coach Gary Kirsten told The Telegraph.         
	Ojha was one of the stars for the winners, Hyderabads Deccan Chargers.         
	Speaking on the morning-after, Kirsten added: One is happy for Ojha, for he bowled really well.         
	Among the most improved of cricketers over the past year, Ojha wasnt afraid to toss it up and two wickets in the ninth over (77 for four) put paid to Bangladeshs challenge.         
	The batsmen, of course, played poor shots (and earned the ire of Siddons and captain Mohammed Ashraful) but credit must still go to the left-arm spinner.         
	Ojha, incidentally, played for Slaithwaite in neighbouring Huddersfield a few years ago and that experience came in handy.         
	The teams shirt-maker, by the way, got it wrong and, so, Ojha played with the area next to on his shirt taped. If he hadnt done so, then his name wouldve read POJHA.         
	Footnote: Former India captain Anil Kumble, who made his debut as a TV commentator during the match, praised Ojha. He was introduced to slow it down and did a superb job... Harbhajan also bowled well... He didnt get wickets, but applied pressure from the other end... I quite liked the Harbhajan-Ojha combination...

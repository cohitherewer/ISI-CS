	Madrid: Champions Barcelona dropped their first La Liga points of the season when they were held 0-0 at Valencia on Saturday.         
	Barca had won six on the trot before their trip to the Mestalla but struggled to find rhythm in the face of intense pressure from the hosts.         
	Keeper Victor Valdes made some decisive interventions and all Valencia lacked was the cool finishing of top-scorer David Villa, who failed to recover from injury in time for the game.         
	Barca remain top with 19 points from seven matches, one ahead of Real Madrid who returned to winning ways with a 4-2 home victory over Real Valladolid.         
	Deportivo Coruna are fourth on 15 points, the same as third-placed Sevilla, after Juan Rodriguezs spectacular strike gave them a 1-0 home win over the in-form Andalusians.         
	The midfielder crashed in a 30-metre drive in the 38th minute and Deportivos well-organised defence kept the visitors at bay to end Sevillas run of seven consecutive wins in all competitions.         
	Barca had Zlatan Ibrahimovic on the bench and Thierry Henry out injured in Valencia and it was Valdes and his defence who were busiest as the home side broke forward with pace at every opportunity.         
	Valdes denied Pablo Hernandez after two minutes and pulled off another one-on-one save from David Silva after a quickly taken free kick in the second period.         
	Although Valencia tired as the second half progressed Barca made little headway in an increasingly bad-tempered affair.         
	Earlier, Gonzalo Higuain came off the bench to settle Reals jitters with a superb lob that completed their victory over Valladolid. Manuel Pellegrinis side, who were without injured forward Cristiano Ronaldo, had suffered their first defeat of the campaign in Sevilla last time out.         
	Raul scored twice in quick succession and Marcelo added a third before the break after Nauzet Aleman had netted a superb free kick for the visitors.         
	Marquitos put Valladolid back in the game again early in the second half and they grew in confidence until Argentine substitute Higuain lifted the ball over Jacobo 11 minutes from time.         
	In Serie A action, midfielder Dejan Stankovic netted with a remarkable volley from the halfway line to help Inter Milan triumph 5-0 at Genoa and surge clear at the top of the table Saturday.         
	With one touch, the powerful Serb hooked the ball in during first-half stoppage time when Genoa keeper Marco Amelia was caught out of position.         
	Jose Mourinhos physical side, whose only loss this term came in Genoa against Sampdoria, should have had more while the hosts could only look back at a failed penalty appeal and Omar Milanettos effort disallowed for a tight offside.         
	Inter have opened a four-point gap over Juventus and Fiorentina, who drew 1-1 in Turin. (REUTERS)

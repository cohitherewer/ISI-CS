The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Vettoris fight goes in vain
                                                     Vettoris fight goes in vain
          
	Colombo: Daniel Vettoris fighting 140 went in vain as Sri Lanka beat New Zealand by 96 runs in the second Test and swept the series 2-0 on the final day Sunday.         
	Spinner Rangana Herath took five wickets as the tourists, needing 494 to win, were bowled out for 397 shortly before tea. The Black Caps entered the last day at a precarious 182 for six, but Vettori and Jacob Oram delayed the inevitable with a 124-run partnership for the seventh wicket.         
	Vettori brought up his fourth Test hundred and was out last with a career-best 140, improving on his previous best of 137 not out. He was well caught by Herath off Muttiah Muralidharan after spending more than four hours at the crease, facing 189 balls and hitting 16 boundaries.         
	Tillekaratne Dilshan put an end to the Black Capss resistance, snaring Oram for 56. The all-rounder was caught by Kumar Sangakkara at extra cover. Oram faced 148 balls and hit five boundaries in bringing up his sixth Test half-century.         
	The partnership between Vettori and Oram came in 228 balls and came after New Zealand coach Andy Moles, on Saturday, accused his players for getting out after good starts and not learning from their mistakes. He called for some character and fight from his batsmen on the final day.         
	Later, Vettori combined with tail-ender Iain Brien for another valuable 69-run partnership before Herath forced an edge off Brien for a catch to wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene. Brien faced 75 balls for his 12.         
	The visitors also enjoyed some luck as Vettori survived an edge to slip, then when Herath broke the stumps without the ball in his hand, with Vettori still some distance away from the crease.

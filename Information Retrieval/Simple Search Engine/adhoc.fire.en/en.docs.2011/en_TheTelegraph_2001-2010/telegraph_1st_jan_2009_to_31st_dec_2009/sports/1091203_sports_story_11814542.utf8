The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Reward for my hard work, says Dinda
                                                                                                                       7                                        Reward for my hard work, says Dinda
            A STAFF REPORTER            Dinda                           
	Calcutta: The last two seasons have been like a roller-coaster ride for Ashok Dinda. In a space of 19 months, the maverick paceman experienced an entire gamut of emotions. Having experienced a few memorable highs and some forgettable lows, Wednesday would certainly be atop the list of all-time high for this 25-year-old who hails from the dusty bylanes of Naichanpur village in East Midnapur.         
	I am absolutely thrilled. I couldnt believe when I got the good news. I knew I was in the selectors radar. Even if you feel that you might just get a chance some day, the breaking news always evokes a special feeling. At this moment, I am really not being able to express myself. I want to thank my family but more than anyone else, my coach Atal Dev Barman. Had he not been there, I couldnt have thought of coming to Calcutta and trying out my luck in serious cricket, were Dindas first reactions when The Telegraph contacted him.         
	Is he a bit surprised by this call-up as he got only seven wickets in three first class matches this season? Not really, he answered back. I was really happy with my performance during the NKP Salve Challenger Series (he got six wickets in three matches). Post my performances in IPL-I, there was only thing in my mind, I have to keep on working hard. Sometimes I have got the results, sometimes I didnt. I believe this is a reward for my hard work, said the speedster.         
	No one can deny that IPL-I changed Dindas destiny forever.         
	IPL-I definitely made me believe that I can play at the top level. It increased my confidence a lot, he admitted.         
	Dinda has done a reality check.         
	I know you have proven performers like Sreesanth, Ishant Sharma, Ashish Nehra in the squad. I will try and learn as much as possible from the senior pros. The best comment came from someone who hasnt had a smooth relation with Dinda during the last 10 months.         
	I hope he is just 24 deliveries (a four over spell in a T20 match) away from stardom. He should get a chance to prove himself, said Ranadeb Bose who knows the pain of being in that dressing room yet missing out on action.

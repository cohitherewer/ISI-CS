The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No ill feeling, says Malik
                                                   No ill feeling, says Malik
                      
	Karachi: Shoaib Malik on Wednesday admitted that he was disappointed at losing the captaincy of the Pakistan cricket team but said he had no issues playing under new captain Younis Khan.         
	Obviously anyone would be disappointed at losing the captaincy, Malik said.         
	But the chairman of the Board requested me to step down at this stage and I agreed because nothing is bigger then the team.         
	Malik dismissed suggestions that it would be hard for him to continue in the team because of the ill feeling created between him and senior players during his captaincy.         
	There was and is no ill-feeling and I did my best to give them respect. If the Board feels the time is right for a new captain, I have no problems. For me playing for Pakistan remains an honour, Malik added.         
	Malik made it clear he had a lot of respect for the senior players including Younis.         
	Meanwhile, Younis has sought support from the public and media to get over the bad times. Our team is not in right frame of mind after its recent defeat at the hands of Sri Lanka. We need support from public and media to better our performance and I look forward to their support, Younis said in his first press conference in Lahore.         
	Asked whether he had made any demands to the PCB before accepting the captaincy, Younis said: The chairman offered me the captaincy and I accepted and this is the entire story. I will meet the PCB chairman after one week to exchange views on the future planning of the national team.

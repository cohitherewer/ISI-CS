	New Delhi: The worlds largest two-wheeler manufacturer Hero Honda Motors Ltd was Monday named the title sponsor for the 2010 FIH Mens Hockey World Cup to be held here in March.         
	The announcement was made at a glittering ceremony here in the presence of International Hockey Federation president Leandro Negre, Indian Olympic Association president Suresh Kalmadi, Hockey India president AK Mattoo and the 1975 World Cup winning members of the Indian team.         
	Negre said the event would provide eight-time Olympic champions India the perfect platform to revive their past glory.         
	For global development of hockey, it is important that India should come up and play to its potential. The FIH hopes that hosting the 2010 World Cup will give a tremendous boost to Indian hockey, Negre said.         
	I have been constantly travelling throughout the world and I must say many teams are eagerly waiting to be a part of the World Cup. (PTI)

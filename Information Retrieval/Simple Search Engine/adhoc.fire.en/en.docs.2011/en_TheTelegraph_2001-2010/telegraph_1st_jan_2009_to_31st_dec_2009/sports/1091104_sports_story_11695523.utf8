The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal have upper hand
                                                                                                                                     Bengal have upper hand
  - Ranadeb takes five for 67 as the hosts are bundled out for 179         A STAFF REPORTER            Ranadeb Bose                                 
	Calcutta: Medium-pacer Ranadeb Bose propelled Bengal to an advantageous position after the first days play in their Ranji Trophy Super League match against Maharashtra, in Pune, on Tuesday.         
	Bose grabbed five for 67 to trigger a collapse as the home side were bundled out for 179. Boses new ball partner Ashok Dinda also put up an impressive display, taking three for 65.         
	However, Bengal too stuttered at the start of their innings as they finished the day on 52 for two with Wriddhiman Saha (10) and Manoj Tiwary (3) at the crease.         
	Openers Deep Dasgupta nad Arindam Das were dismissed for 1 and 38 respectively. Sajin Sureshnath and Azhar Ansari took a wicket each for the hosts.         
	Arindam looked well set for a good score and was cruising along when Ansari had him caught behind by wicketkeeper Rohit Motwani.         
	Arindam hit eight boundaries in his 65-ball stay at the innings.         
	His opening partner Deep, however, was dismissed in the second over when Sureshnath trapped him before the wicket.         
	Earlier, Maharashtra found the going tough and were it not for Sangram Atitkar (44) and Azhar Ansari (52), they could have been in greater trouble.         
	Bose swept off the Maharashtra top-order, removing their top four batsmen as the rivals were reduced to 53 for four. However, Atitkar and Ansari chipped in with some useful runs as the other batsmen failed.         
	The initial moisture in the wicket helped the Bengal medium pacers extract movement and pace out of the track. Dinda was effective with his pace as he accounted for the hosts middle-order.         
	Bengal went in with two spinners in Saurasish Lahiri and Shib Sagar Singh and it was the latter who got rid of the Maharashtra tail, finishing with figures of two for 12 in five overs.         
	Bengal assistant coach, Goutam Shome Jr, who is in charge of the team in the absence of coach roger Binny, revealed that the pitch promises to be a good batting track and it was actually the moisture in the early hours which undid the Maharashtra batsmen.         
	It looks a good batting track If we can bat sensibly tomorrow (Wednesday) and set up a decent total, theree no reason why we cant expect a good result from the match, he said.

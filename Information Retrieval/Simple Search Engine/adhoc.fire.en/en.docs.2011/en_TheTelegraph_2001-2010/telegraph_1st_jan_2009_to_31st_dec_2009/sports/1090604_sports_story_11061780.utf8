The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gautam, Rohit dazzle as India rout Pakistan
                                                   Gautam, Rohit dazzle as India rout Pakistan
                      
	London: Rohit Sharma tore apart Pakistans bowling with a 80-run blitzkrieg as India bulldozed their arch-rivals by nine wickets with three overs to spare in their final warm-up match of the ICC World Twenty20 at the Oval Wednesday.         
	Chasing 159, Rohit and Gautam Gambhir (52 not out) raised 140 in just 16 overs for the opening stand to slam the door on Pakistan. India cruised to the target in 17 overs to complete a facile win.         
	Rohits was a sublime 53-ball knock, including nine fours and two sixes. Gambhir played the second fiddle to perfection and was unbeaten after a 47-ball innings that included five hits to the fence.         
	With Gambhir and Rohit in fine touch, Indias chase was off to a rollicking start and they never relaxed their grip. Gambhir flicked the first ball from Umar Gul for a delectable four and ended the over in similar fashion.         
	Rohit, meanwhile, was not ready to be outshone. Accordingly, Gul was hit over mid-on for a four and Yasir Arafat was dispatched into the stands for the first six of the match.         
	Shahid Afridi also found himself at the receiving end of Rohits wrath when the batsman smote him over midwicket for a huge six.         
	Rohit eventually fell in the 16th over, but by then the match was beyond Pakistans grasp.         
	Earlier, Pakistan got off to a flier but Indias disciplined bowling unit staged a remarkable comeback to restrict them to 158 for six.         
	After losing an early wicket, Pakistan cruised to 45 in just over four overs before losing three wickets in quick succession. However, cameos from Ahmed Shehzad (25), Younis Khan (32), Misbah-ul Haq (37 not out) and Yasir Arafat (25 not out) ensured they crossed the 150-mark.         
	After winning the toss, Younis Khan sent out teen twins Shahzaib Hasan (0) and Ahmed Shehzad to open the innings but Hasan was back in the hut soon after Praveen Kumars fifth legitimate delivery pegged back his off-stump.         
	Shehzads, too, could have been a brief stay but Harbhajan Singh grassed a sitter at mid-wicket off Rudra Pratap Singh when the batsman was on five and India were made to pay. Shehzad went all out against the Indian bowlers, and suddenly it was raining boundaries. RP conceded two in the same over and Praveen didnt escape unscathed either as Shehzad pulled and drove with elan.         
	Shehzads aggression proved contagious as Kamran Akmal (19) joined the party. It was probably too good to last and Pakistan lost three wickets off five balls with Raina in the thick of action. An airborne Raina first did a Jonty Rhodes to swoop on a ball and hit the stumps to remove Akmal, and then placed himself under Shehzads miscued skier in the same Ishant Sharma over.         
	Shahid Afridis was a blink-and-miss stay as the swashbuckling right-hander bottom edged Irfan Pathan and Mahendra Singh Dhoni took a diving catch to remove him for a duck. Shoaib Malik (14) started well before Pragyan Ojha snared the former captain in his first over and Pakistan were without their top half when the score reached 63.         
	Younis and Misbah raised 50 runs in 7.3 overs but boundaries had dried up by then. Harbhajan got rid off Younis, but Misbah and Arafat threw their bat at everything to push the score past the 150-mark.         
	Incidentally, Younis and his men revisited the Oval for the first time carrying the nastiest scar of forfeiting a Test against England.         
	Meanwhile, high-profile stakeholders got the ball rolling with charity donations as part of the Catch the Spirit match at the Oval.         
	The hosts for Wednesdays match, Surrey County Cricket Club, along with the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), another of the venues for the ICC World Twenty20, were among the first to pledge their support.         
	The West Indies board and the Bangladesh board agreed to contribute to the good causes targeted by the fund-raising. The Pakistan players will also make a donation.

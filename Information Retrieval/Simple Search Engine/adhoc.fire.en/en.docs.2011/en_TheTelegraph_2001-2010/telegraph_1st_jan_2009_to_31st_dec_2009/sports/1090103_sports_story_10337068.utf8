The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Moores lacks innovation
                                                     Moores lacks innovation
            SIMON HUGHES            Peter Moores                           
	In cricket, the coachs position is more delicate than in any other sport. Unlike their football equivalents, for instance, who can change strategy at any time with substitutions or new formations, the cricket coach is powerless to intervene for great swathes of the day and must sit in the dressing-room and bite his tongue.         
	Although preparation and the overall approach might be his responsibility, he has little control over the team once play starts, yet will usually get the blame if things go awry.         
	The coaches are the teams shock absorbers. The captain is the alpha male  and rightly so. And they do not come much more alpha than Kevin Pietersen. There is likely to be only one winner in this little contretemps.         
	Coaches fall into two categories. There are the traditionalists  usually men nearing 60  who bark orders, haul errant players up by the nipple, and generally run the show. Greg Chappell was one, Duncan Fletcher had elements of this style, certainly latterly.         
	Then there are the facilitators, men who blend more into the background, organising practice and recruiting experts for the high-tech stuff. Australias John Buchanan was this type, so is South Africas Graham Ford. Peter Moores, too, fits this mould.         
	The crucial requirement for any modern coach, however, is to stay ahead of the game. The captain has enough of a job just managing his resources on the field. The coach needs, as the jargon goes, to think outside the box.         
	This is where Fletcher, Buchanan and Ford have been successful, using a combination of science and psychology. Fletcher devised the forward press for batting against spin and reverse-swing from around the wicket to knock over the Aussies. Buchanan and Ford pinpointed mental frailty in opposition line-ups. Each gave their teams that crucial extra five per cent.         
	So far this is where Moores has been found wanting. He has brought a freshness and verve to training that all the players enjoy  Andrew Flintoff was privately eulogising Moores approach in India  and England, physically, are as well prepared as they have ever been. The coaching staff integrates well with the players. But strategically, they have been found wanting.         
	Test cricket is a rapidly evolving medium but Englands bowling methods and fielding plans seem largely stuck in 2005. They have been playing catch-up to India, Sri Lanka and South Africas artful skills, and at pressure moments in the field, there seems to be only a Plan A  hand the ball to Freddie.         
	Pietersen cut a forlorn figure as he cast around for alternatives in Chennai. As an inexperienced captain, he needed more imaginative input from the coaching staff. Moores is a decent, enthusiastic, hardworking man, and he is certainly not timid, giving a strong lead in the departure of Michael Vaughan as captain. But as a coach who has spent most of his time around county cricket, he perhaps lacks real sophistication at the highest level. This is probably the source of Pietersens lack of respect.         
	Having a close working relationship with Pietersen cannot be easy. He can be intolerant, and his brand of cricket is beyond the bounds of structured thinking. He is instinctive in his play  though he practises assiduously  and often unpredictable. He is totally self-assured.         
	It is revealing that when he seeks batting advice  reassurance mainly  he talks to trusted former batting stars such as Matthew Maynard and Andy Flower, rather than to Moores. Compliments for the coach are conspicuous by their absence in Pietersens press conferences. Not that there has been much cause for compliments of late.         
	That, of course, is the acid test. The availability of video evidence allows players to self-analyse, scrutinising innings on their iPods, meaning a head coach is less and less influential on individual productivity and more and more responsible for team performance. And as the team fails, so the coachs wheelbase looks increasingly wobbly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Md. Sporting blame it on foreigners
                                                   Md. Sporting blame it on foreigners
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting, who were relegated to the second division on Thursday, accused their three foreigners  skipper Mike Okoro, Adewusi Adebayo and Eugene Gray  of throwing away the match against Churchill Brothers in the last-round match of the I-League. Churchill defeated the Calcutta outfit 6-2.         
	Everyone who was at the ground (in Margao) knows what happened. They were paid by Churchill Brothers to deliberately under-perform. We are hundred per cent sure. We will request the AIFF to make sure these players dont get any clubs in the future, a club official told The Telegraph from Margao.         
	Coach Shabbir Ali who refused to comment on the issue, however, said that the trio did not live up to expectations. We banked on them but they failed miserably. I wont say anything more, Shabbir said.         
	Shabbir, in fact, got Adebayo substituted in the 20th minute. His mind was somewhere else, he said.         
	Its not the first time Mohammedan Sporting have accused players of underperforming after things didnt go their way. In 2006-07, after losing to Mahindra United 9-0 in Mumbai in their last match, Mohammedan Sporting accused some players, including Gopal Das and Madhab Das, of match-fixing.         
	Shabbir, meanwhile, said he was not sure about his future. Into the second year of his three-year contract, Shabbir will be flying to Hyderabad for a three-month break on Friday and will take his own time in deciding his future. I havent decided whether I will stay. Its up to the club, he said.         
	Shabbir did not agree that the pay dispute some months back had its effect on Mohammedan Sporting.

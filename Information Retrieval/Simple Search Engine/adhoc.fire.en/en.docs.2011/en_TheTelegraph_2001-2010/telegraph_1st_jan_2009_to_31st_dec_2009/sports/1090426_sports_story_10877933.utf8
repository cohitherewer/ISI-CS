    - Team India spearhead says he has learnt a lot by bowling with Zaheer             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL                                     
	Cape Town: Ishant Sharma, the 20-year-old Team India and Kolkata Knight Riders spearhead, spoke to The Telegraph at The Cullinan hotel on Friday evening.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q Youll be completing two years as an international cricketer next month. What have you learnt the most in this period?         
	A How to get better... Have got a better knowledge of my body too... How to carry the workload and, then, how to recover... Ive tried to make the most of the exposure given and experience gained... Ive also learnt a lot by bowling with Zaheer Khan.         
	What have you taken from Zaheer, who is months away from nine years at the top level?         
	Any bowler must be quick to adapt to the conditions and thats what Ive learnt from him... Zaheerbhais tips have been very useful... He keeps telling me that a fast bowler has to have a big heart... Bada dil hona zaroori hai.         
	How much of your bowling is a mind-effort?         
	Look, youve constantly got to out-think batsmen, get on top of them mentally... Youve got to be mentally strong. Of course, youve got to remember that if youre a professional, then so are the batsmen... So, nothing will come easy... At the international level, you cant get bogged down with too many technical things...Its in the mind that youve got to be at the top of your game.         
	While preparing for a series/tournament, do you sit with the teams analyst?         
	If needed, but because theres so much cricket, both batsmen and bowlers know each other... More than sitting with the analyst, its important to perfect your weapon at nets.         
	Youre very involved at nets...         
	Absolutely... Its such an important part of ones preparations.         
	Venkatesh Prasad is the Team India bowling coach. How much of a help has he been?         
	Hes a confidence-giver and has ironed out a few flaws... If ones skills are good, then one can come out of tough situations.         
	Everybody has been praising coach Gary Kirsten. What has your experience been?         
	Garys also a confidence-giver... Even if Ive had a bad day, he has kept my morale up... Hes never blamed me, instead has given confidence... That way, Ive never felt pressure... He keeps saying that hell be happy as long as we give 100 per cent... Results arent most important for him.         
	How has it been with John Buchanan in the IPL?         
	Hes given me the freedom to operate... I havent had a problem... In a way, Johns like Kirsten.         
	To talk of captains, you made your India debut (Bangladesh, 2007) under Rahul Dravid, then your comeback was when Anil Kumble was at the helm and have played the most under Mahendra Singh Dhoni... Have they been very different from each other?         
	Only my debut Test was under Rahulbhai... Anilbhai was very good, the way he backed his players was so comfort-giving... Hed tell me that Im not merely filling a place in the XI, but should look at myself as a match-winner... MSbhai is the same... He wants the younger players to learn from tough situations... Hes himself so calm... MSbhai wants the younger lot to become strong in the mind, which is a good thing.         
	Youve got injured a few times...         
	The last couple of times, it has been because of diving, not directly related to bowling... I mean, I havent got injured due to the overload factor. As a professional, Ive got to be prepared for injuries.         
	Now that T20 has caught on, youve got to keep adjusting your style...         
	Test cricket gives you time and is also the ultimate test for a cricketer... The pace of T20 is hot and youre constantly doing things in those 20 overs... Whatever the form, your skills have to be correct, otherwise youll be in trouble... Both in T20 and in the 50-over game, your approach is influenced by the role given to you... Both are momentum-driven and youve got to either break the oppositions momentum or keep your team going. Ek cheez lekin constant hai  youve got to bowl in the right areas. That holds true for Test cricket and the other forms. But, yes, you probably need a bigger heart in T20... Im saying that because perfectly good balls could get hit big.         
	Some, it appears, are happy bowling four overs in the IPL matches and not keen now on going through the grind of the Ranji Trophy. Your comments?         
	Im not aware of such cases, but Test cricket is the real thing and, to become a Test cricketer, youve surely got to play in the Ranji Trophy.         
	Looking back, would you still pick the 2007-08 tour of Australia as the platform where you performed the best?         
	Yes... I learnt a lot... The value of pace (timed at over 150 kmph), of using my height to extract bounce... That will remain a special tour.         
	You couldve done better on the recent tour of New Zealand...         
	I agree... Couldve been better.         
	Did you interact with Sir Richard Hadlee there?         
	No... (After a pause) I dont like complicating my cricket... The more simple you keep it, the better the chances of doing well.         
	How important is aggression?         
	A fast bowler should be aggressive, but not abusive... Aggression should be used in a positive manner. Aggression for me would be to bowl a bouncer after beating a batsman twice in succession...         
	Is there a batsman who has made you want to tear your hair?         
	No... I back my skills and have self-belief.         
	You grew up admiring Glenn McGrath, but have you, in the past two years, been impressed with anybodys bowling?         
	Andrew Flintoff... He adapts to the conditions very well and is fully aware of his strengths... Then, within my own team, its Zaheerbhai.         
	Life has changed in the past two years...         
	Bahut jyada... Two years ago, nobody knew me... Today, people want to be seen with me... They pray for my success... Nowadays, though, I cant go to a chola-bhaturewala by the roadside... That freedom has gone, but thats the price one ends up paying... Id say its a small price as, on the other hand, one has the honour of playing for the country.         
	How have you handled the riches bestowed by the IPL?         
	Money is one aspect of the game... That hasnt driven me, playing for India has... India ke liye khelna sabse badi baat hai... Money will come as long as I perform and stay fit... Cricket has given me everything and, so, Ill always respect the game.         
	In material terms, are you aspiring for anything?         
	(Laughs) Aisa kuch nahin.         
	You remain an ardent fan of Manchester United...         
	Absolutely... The other night, I saw their match against Portsmouth, saw them win 2-0.         
	Who has had the biggest influence on you?         
	My parents (Girisha, Vijay Kumar) and my (elder) sister Iva... Theyve been such a strong support group, as also the extended family... My uncles, in particular, have been very helpful.         
	[An uncle, Balwinder Singh, who played for Railways, is the one who actually encouraged Ishant the most.]         
	Youre a huge fan of Shah Rukh Khan, the Knights principal owner...         
	Jee haan... Ive watched DDLJ countless times.         
	Have you told him that?         
	Would look odd.         
	The last question: What if you had to bowl the Super Over on Thursday?         
	I didnt have to, so why talk about it... Jab karna padega, tab dekha jayega...

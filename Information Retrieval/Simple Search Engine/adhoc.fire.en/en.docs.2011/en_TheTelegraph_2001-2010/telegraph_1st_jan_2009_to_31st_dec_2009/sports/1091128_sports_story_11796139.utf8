The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Say goodbye to reputations: Manoj
                                                                                                                       7                                        Say goodbye to reputations: Manoj
  - Stand-in Bengal captain sends out strong message to teammates       A STAFF REPORTER            Manoj Tiwary                                 
	Calcutta: Manoj Tiwary should be lauded for speaking his mind.         
	The stand-in Bengal captain gave vent to his ire against the players for their listless performance in the Ranji Trophy match against Saurashtra.         
	We should say goodbye to reputations Every individual has to think about the team goal, said a livid Tiwary, without naming anyone.         
	Does it mean that the players havent been performing with the team goal in mind?         
	I will only say theres room for improvement in this area, he clarified.         
	Bengal, needing 331 runs to overhaul Saurashtras 650 with eight wickets remaining, lost the plot on the final day at the Eden. The visitors enforced follow-on after Bengal finished 194 runs in arrears.         
	Bengal, who could have got three points from the match had their batsmen showed some discipline, had to remain content with just one. The visitors took home the three points.         
	The CAB, for its part, tried to brush things under the carpet by sending a strong message to Tiwary.         
	Manager Russi Jeejeebhoy was told the captain should try and avoid unnecessary controversies off the field.         
	He cant speak on matters that might affect the team spirit He should have shown more responsibility when speaking to the media Moreover, the manager should have been present at the news conference, said a senior CAB official.         
	Tiwary was candid and didnt make any attempt to hide his feelings.         
	We played bad shots on Friday. We had planned to play out the first session but that didnt happen. I fell to a poor shot in the second over of the day.         
	Batting was our strength and we needed to apply ourselves But, then, cricket is a one ball game. We played poorly and have got to accept that it is part and parcel of the game, he explained.         
	He didnt spare anyone. We need to be more disciplined. The bowlers need to bowl to their fields and thats just not happening. We need to improve in all departments. I know the team is capable of performing better and we need to apply ourselves, said Tiwary.         
	He also explained the logic behind continuing with Arindam Das and Deep Dasgupta in the final hour despite farcical bowling and appeals by the rival captain to bring proceedings to an end.         
	I wanted them to get some runs under their belt. I didnt want anyone to point a finger at them when selection issues are raised.         
	Tiwary knows well that the final two group matches against Uttar Pradesh and Delhi will be tough.         
	The CAB, however, can breathe easy as regular captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla is fit and available for the next match against Uttar Pradesh in Kanpur from December 8.

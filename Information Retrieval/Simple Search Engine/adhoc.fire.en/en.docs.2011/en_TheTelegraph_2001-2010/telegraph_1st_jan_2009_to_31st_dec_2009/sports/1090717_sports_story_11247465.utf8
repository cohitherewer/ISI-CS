                                                     Nicki takes 12th stage

	Vittel: Dane Nicki Sorensen powered to a solo victory in the 12th stage of the Tour de France, a 211.5-km ride from Tonnerre to Vittel on Thursday.         
	The Saxo Bank rider attacked twice in the finale to beat Frances Laurent Lefevre and Italian Franco Pellizotti, who were second and third, respectively, 48 seconds behind.         
	Italys Rinaldo Nocentini retained the overall leaders yellow jersey ahead of Spaniard Alberto Contador and Lance Armstrong, second and third, respectively.         
	Sorensen featured in a seven-man breakaway at the 64-km mark that quickly built a gap of over four minutes  and he proved the strongest of the group.         
	I am extremely happy, it is something than I hardly thought of. I was lucky to win this one, said the 34-year-old Sorensen.         
	Lance Armstrong suffered a puncture after 150 kilometres but the seven-time champion was quickly brought back into the bunch by four teammates after he had had his rear wheel changed.         
	His Astana team suffered a potential blow when American Leipheimer, fourth overall, crashed towards the end of the stage.         
	Australian Cadel Evans, runner-up in the last two editions, also fell off his bike in similar circumstances.           (REUTERS)

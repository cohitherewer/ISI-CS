The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Becks hopes to play 14 Cup
                                                                                                                       7                                      Becks hopes to play 14 Cup
                      
	Rome: England midfielder David Beckham hopes next years World Cup in South Africa will not be his last even though he will be knocking on 40 at the 2014 finals in Brazil.         
	Well see. Id like to be able to play until Im 40 and take part in another World Cup, but you have to assess the situation year after year, Beckham told a weekly magazine here.         
	When you reach my age, things start to slow down. Ive always said Ill always be available for England. If they didnt call me up, Id do everything to put myself in the condition to be recalled.         
	The former Real Madrid and Manchester United player added: The moment may come when I say enough, but as things are now, I dont see it as possible.         
	Beckham has admitted he is no certainty to make Englands 2010 World Cup party.         
	He rejoins AC Milan on loan in January to try to boost his chances of making Fabio Capellos squad after helping the Los Angeles Galaxy reach the final of this years Major League Soccer Cup.         
	We all know what Capello is like and how he reacts if you are playing well or badly. In the first case, you have a chance; in the second, you dont.         
	Thats why its important for me to return to Milan and put myself on show. Capello always said I had to return to Europe after December if I wanted to be at the World Cup.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods closes in on title
                                                   Woods closes in on title
                      
	Grand Blanc: Tiger Woods will take a one-shot lead into the final round of the Buick Open as the world No. 1 shifted into top gear on Saturday firing a seven-under 65.         
	After an erratic opening round 71 left him eight shots off the pace and sparked talk of missing consecutive cuts for the first time in his professional career, Woods has spectacularly hit back to top the leaderboard on 17-under 199, one shot clear of faltering American Michael Letzig.         
	Woods triggered a wild roar that rumbled across the Warwick Hills layout when he rolled in a 34-foot birdie on the par three 17th to join Letzig at the top of the leaderboard.         
	It looked to be the way the third round would end until Letzig stumbled to a double-bogeyed at the 18th for a four-under 68, gifting Woods a one stroke lead.         
	Australian John Senden, who held a two shot lead overnight, struggled to a one-under 71 to leave him two back going into Sundays final round.         
	It will be the 50th time Woods has taken a lead into the final round. He has gone on to win the title 46 of the previous 49 times. (Reuters)

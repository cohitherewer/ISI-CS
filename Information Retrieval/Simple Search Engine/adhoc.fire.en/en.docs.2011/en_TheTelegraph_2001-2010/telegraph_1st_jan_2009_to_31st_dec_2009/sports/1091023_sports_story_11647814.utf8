	New Delhi: Theres a question mark over Indias participation in the Asian under-19 championship as the government might not allow the team to travel to Iraq to play the qualifiers.         
	According to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources, the ministry of external affairs is yet to clear the team for the trip because of security reasons. India are scheduled to play their first match against hosts Iraq on November 5.         
	The federation will have to sign an indemnity bond to send the team to Iraq, said a source. The AIFF president Praful Patel may also intervene at the last minute to get the team cleared.         
	Non-participation could be a big setback as the juniors have prepared well for the Asian meet. A last minute withdrawal is likely to invite sanction from the AFC.

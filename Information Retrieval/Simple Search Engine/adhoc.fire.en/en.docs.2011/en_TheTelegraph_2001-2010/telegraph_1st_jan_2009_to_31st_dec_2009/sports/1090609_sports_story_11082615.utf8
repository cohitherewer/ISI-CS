	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan Monday slapped a six-month suspension on Bhaichung Bhutia for defying club discipline and neglecting club duties throughout the season.         
	Bagans 22-member executive committee, after a long meeting decided to suspend Bhaichung, who is presently in Sikkim.         
	We saw Bhaichung neglecting his duties towards the club for a long time. So we have decided to suspend him for six months. Nobody is above the club. He has defied club discipline and thats why we have decided to suspend him, Bagan vice-president Subrata Mukherjee said after the meeting. The suspension will not allow the striker to sign for any club next season. We dont have any personal problem with Bhaichung. This is a message only to show that nobody is above the club.         
	We have also decided to empower the general secretary to take any further decision in this regard. The secretary, if he feels, can consider the suspension order and reduce it from six months to six days. It depends on the secretary and we will support him, Mukherjee added. Elaborating on the reason that forced Bagan to take such a drastic step, Mukherjee, a former Mayor of the city said: Though he is our captain he has let us down on various occasions. He was more focused on things other than football. A footballer should be disciplined and should follow the rules of the club he is playing for. And the committee has unanimously taken the decision to suspend him.         
	Asked what Bhaichung wrote to the club in his reply to the show-cause notice of May 14, Mukherjee said: We are not at all satisfied with Bhaichungs reply. It has nothing to do with what wed asked him in the show-cause notice. He has also violated the rules and regulations of the club while replying. The secretary had asked him to reply within 48 hours but he did not bother to. He took his own time to reply.         
	He did not take anybodys permission before participating in the dance programme He is a registered player and cannot act in this manner, Mukherjee said. The club incidentally asked Bhaichung to explain his casual conduct within 48 hours on May 14 but the striker replied on May 21.         
	On whether Bhaichung, in his reply, had asked for a release from the club, Mukherjee said: We dont want to talk about releasing Bhaichung. According to our contract, he will continue as a Bagan player till 2010.         
	On Bhaichung playing for the national side in these six months: We have no objection if he plays for the national team, Mukherjee said. The India captain was unavailable for comment. However, a source close to him said that he could move court.         
	East Bengal officials, when contacted, declined to comment on the issue.

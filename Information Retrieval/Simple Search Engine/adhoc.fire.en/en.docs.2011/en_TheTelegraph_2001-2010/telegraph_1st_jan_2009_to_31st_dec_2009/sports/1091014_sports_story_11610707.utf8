The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chargers need to win big
                                                   Chargers need to win big
                      
	Hyderabad: Aware that only an outright win with a healthy margin can clear their Super Eight passage, Indian Premier League (IPL) champions Deccan Chargers would go for the jugular when they take on Trinidad amp; Tobago in their last Group A match of the Champions League Twenty20 here Wednesday.         
	Somerset Sabres are the only team in this group to have completed their league campaign, sneaking to a tense victory against the Chargers in their first match before crashing to a 44-run defeat against T amp;T. In such a scenario, Adam Gilchrist and his teammates have little choice but to go for an outright win, in addition to bettering the net run rate.         
	Things would not have been so complicated for the IPL champions, had they clinched the thriller against Somerset. The likes of Fidel Edwards, RP Singh, Pragyan Ojha or Scott Styris could not break the 50-run ninth-wicket stand between James Hildreth and Alfonso Thomas, which cost them the match.         
	The Chargerss batting looks formidable on paper, but what the team expects from Gilchrist is sustained aggression, not just brief, brisk knocks. His opening partner VVS Laxman, however, looks in silken touch and proved a batsman does not necessarily have to play ugly to score fast.         
	But to give their bowlers a good total to defend, the Chargers need Andrew Symonds to fire and Rohit Sharma to replicate the red hot form he had displayed in the IPL.         
	In bowling, RP Singh looked dangerous, while Ojha also got a couple of wickets against the Sabres, but Edwards and Harmeet Singh need to raise their game at a time when the team is staring at an early exit from the tournament.         
	While there would be desperation in the Chargers dugout, Trinidad and Tobago would be high on confidence, following their 44-run win against the Sabres. The team under Daren Ganga looked a close-knit unit in their first outing.         
	Dwayne Bravos presence lends a sharp look to their attack, while spin twins Dave Mohammad and Sherwin Ganga can also prove quite a handful.

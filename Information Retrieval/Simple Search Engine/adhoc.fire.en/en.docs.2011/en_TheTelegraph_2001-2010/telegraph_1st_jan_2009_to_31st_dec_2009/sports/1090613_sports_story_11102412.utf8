The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Veterans recall a rout, back Bengal for repeat
                                                   Veterans recall a rout, back Bengal for repeat
            ANSHUMAN ROY                      
	Chennai: Its dj vu. Ten years back, here at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Bengal won the Santosh Trophy defeating pre-tournament favourites Goa 5-0 in the final. Basudeb Mondal, Bhaichung Bhutia, Raman Vijayan, Carlton Chapman and Dipendu Biswas were on target in one of Bengals most memorable victories. It was Bengals sixth Santosh Trophy victory in as many years and also the last.         
	Now, in 2009, Raghu Nandys boys are up against the same opponents and are on the threshold of turning a new corner  winning the trophy for the 30th time, ending a 10-year wait.         
	How do Basudeb Mondal, Raman Vijayan and Dipendu Biswas remember that win? The Telegraph took a trip down memory lane with the trio who revisited the decimation of Goa.         
	I still remember that tournament. I scored the best goal of my career in the final. A flying header from the top of the penalty box and I lost my consciousness after landing on the ground. When I regained my senses, I could not recollect what had happened. But the coaches (Sudip Chatterjee and Shankar Banerjee) were congratulating me and slowly everything fell into place, Raman, now in Chennai watching the Santosh Trophy, said on Friday.         
	Raman said the present Goa team cant be compared to the team Bengal defeated. Packed with Salgaocar players  the Goan side won the Fed Cup and National League that year  and coached by Salgaocars Shabbir Ali, the Goans were the overwhelming favourites.         
	They were acting as if they had already won the trophy. Before the final, in the tunnel their body language gave such an impression. That steeled our nerves and we showed them who the boss was, Basudeb, the man who scored the first goal, said from Calcutta.         
	According to Dipendu, the way Goa started the match nobody thought the end result would be such.         
	Minutes after kick-off Somatai Shaiza hit the post twice and Hemanta Dora made two stunning saves. But Basudebs goal changed the complexion of the match. That year none of the Calcutta clubs were able to match Salgaocar. That win was a sort of revenge for many of us, Dipendu said.         
	Raman is putting his money on Bengal for this years final. They (Bengal) are peaking at the right time. Against Services, Bengal did not do much but got two important goals. And thats a good sign. Agrees Basudeb: Goa did not look good enough. Bengal may do it this time.         
	Well thats what we all want. Bring home the cup, boys!

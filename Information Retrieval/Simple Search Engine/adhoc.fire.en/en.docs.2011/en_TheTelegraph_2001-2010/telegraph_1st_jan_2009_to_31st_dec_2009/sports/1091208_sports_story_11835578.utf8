The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Manager Raquib denies   Gul-Aamer scuffle 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Manager Raquib denies   Gul-Aamer scuffle 
                            
	Karachi: Pak pacers Mohammed Aamer and Umar Gul were reportedly involved in a scuffle after the the second Test in New Zealand, but the team management has denied any such incident.         
	According to a report by a TV channel, the duo were fined for getting physical with each other in Wellington. However, team manager Abdul Raquib denied the story.         
	No fight took place between Aamer and Gul, and they have not been fined by the management, Raquib said Monday.         
	This is not the first time that such incidents have been reported from a touring Pakistan squad. In 2007, Shoaib Akhtar was sent home from South Africa and banned for 13 matches after he hit Mohammed Asif with a bat.         
	Meanwhile, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) will decide Tuesday if Mohammed Yousuf should be retained as captain for the upcoming Test and one-day series against Australia, when the squads are announced.         
	With Younis Khan unavailable, Yousuf is expected to be retained at the helm for at least the Test series against the Aussies. (PTI)

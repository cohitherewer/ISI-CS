                                                   Better than Rod Laver
            GUEST COLUMN - Jaidip Mukerjea                
	A true champion. Thats the only way I can describe Roger Federer. On his turf, the green grass of Wimbledons Centre Court which he has dominated since 2003, this was the greatest match he has ever played.         
	Just like last years final between Federer and Rafael Nadal, this encounter between the world No. 2 and sixth seed Andy Roddick, was equally impressive. The final scoreline, which read 5-7, 7-6 (8-6), 7-6 (7-5), 3-6, 16-14 after 257 minutes of play, had class written all over.         
	I think after this win  a record 15th Grand Slam titles  there wont be any debate on whos the greatest player of all time. When Pete Sampras won his 14th Grand Slam title, the world thought that would stand for ages. But then we never thought that someone from Basel, Switzerland, would come and bewitch us with his class and grace.         
	Congratulations to Roddick for playing the best match of his career. After bowing out of the Championships last year in the second round and reaching a Grand Slam final after 2006, he showed marvellous improvement.         
	Its not easy playing against a player like Federer. With the 15 Grand Slams, he created many different records. He clinched his No. 1 position on top of the Association of Tennis Professionals chart by passing Nadal, he won six Wimbledon trophies, and became the third man in 40 years to win both the French Open and Wimbledon on the trot.         
	The man is a sheer genius. It took Pete (Sampras) 12 years to achieve his feat but Federer took exactly half the time.         
	I am honoured that I was there to witness history being created.         
	Though Federer did not begin this quest as easily one might have predicted, he finally came through. The first set was taken by Roddick the moment he got a break point leading 6-5, 30-40. In the second, when the American was up 6-2 in the tie break with four set points in hand, one in the stands thought that this was it. Federer was doomed as Roddick would just lift the trophy in a straight set victory. But he was unlucky. Losing the tie break and the second set, then again losing the third set in another tie-break, it seemed that Federer had some hope left in the match.         
	If one counts the number of games, one will see that Roddick won more. Under his new coach Larry Stefanski, the American has lost weight and is playing better than ever.         
	In their head to head meetings, Federer led Roddick 18-2 before this match. Federer had also won two of the precious grass court Grand Slams defeating this very opponent. However, the Swiss did say that every time he has played Roddick in their past 20 meetings, he brought something new to the court. Its exactly what he did Sunday. Roddick mixed up his game to confuse Federer. He served aces on his service games and played on his opponents serves and tried to bring out the weaknesses.         
	The fourth set seemed to finish very fast as Roddick broke Federer to go up 3-1 at an extremely crucial juncture. From then on, winning the set 6-3 was as just as easy.         
	The class of tennis worthy of a Wimbledon final ultimately boiled down to the final heart stopping set. It seemed to go on forever. But its at these moments that true champions must prove themselves and Roger Federer did exactly that. Its at these moments on can differentiate between a true great and the best there is.         
	Even though the set went on serve till 8-8 when Roddick managed to get two break points, Federer just lifted his game to that point where geniuses are created. The Swiss aced when required and during times of trouble, he showed his true class. That man hit 50 aces compared to Roddicks 27. It seemed as if the tables had turned, after all, its Roddick who is known for his fierce serves.         
	Federer deserved this win. A true champion is someone who can play great tennis, win during moments of danger and lift his game to the level of greatness to win the last point.         
	His name should be etched in history books, as he is the greatest that ever graced this game. In our generation we had wooden racquets and a different style of play. The past greats  Rod Laver, Bjorn Borg, Pete Sampras  all were present to honour this man on Centre Court Sunday. The respect these former greats have for Federer is enormous as they came to witness history and show their support.         
	I dont want to discredit any of the past Wimbledon winners, but I think Federer has managed to go beyond Rod Lavers accomplishmets, whom our generation called the greatest player ever.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | From better to best
                                                                                                                   From better to best

	Tucked away in a quiet corner in Golf Garden on Prince Gulam Mohammed Shah Road is a school that took every participant at the Great TTIS Challenge 08 by surprise. Hirendra Leela Patranabis School, formerly known as Better High School, beat better known schools to win the Champion of Champions trophy at the carnival held on December 5, 6 and 7.         
	The trophy goes to the school that wins the highest number of prizes in competitive categories. And this school won armloads of prizes. They bagged the first prize in medley and T-shirt painting (junior) and came second in fusion dance, best play and mock a band. The best actor award went to Sayani Ghosh of Class X while Pratik Bhattacharya was adjudged the best mocker.         
	Ask the participants if it took a lot of practice, and they say, A lot of it came naturally.                Students of Gokhale Memorial Girls School perform at their Founders Day celebration at Sarala Ray Memorial Community Hall. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray      
	We act all the time in school. From faking headaches, to pretending that we are discussing class lectures when we are actually gossiping, points out Sayani, who was impressive as a crooked godman in a play on dispelling superstition. Her co-actors agree. Laboni Chaudhuri of Class XI, who represented the school in Fusion Dance, explains that they incorporate all their whackiness into their dance. We are a wild bunch. What you saw in our performance came out through the dance, laughs Laboni.         
	Gothic regalia, with black nail polish and piercings, and Pratik, playing the lead singer pretending to be a vampire, ensured them the first position in the mock-a-band category We mocked the extreme metal band called Cradle of Filth, says Argha Modak of Class XI, who is also in the schools western music band called Virus.        
	Balancing a rocker attitude with Bollywood fundas was what gave the medley team an edge. And why not? They had Rafi-fan Sanjay Tripathi of Class XI and Kishore Kumar aficionado Kushal De in the team. Perhaps the most conscientious was the youngest participant from the school, Subhayan Banerjee of Class VI, who won a first prize for interpreting the theme of green Calcutta on a T- shirt.         
	Confidence played a key role in their success. After we came out on top at the prelims, the finals seemed easy, said Sayani.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sleepless in city over shutdown in the hills
                                                                                                               Sleepless in city over shutdown in the hills
  - Security and food shortage prime concern of guardians with wards in strike-hit Darjeeling schools          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                          Schoolchildren during a previous shutdown in the hills                                         
	Anirban Chakraborty (name changed) took a very difficult decision last weekend: to pull his son out of the Kurseong school where he has studied from Class III to VIII.        
	 I had first contemplated shifting him from St Anthonys in Kurseong to St Michaels in Siliguri during a weeklong strike a year ago. My mind was made up when the latest indefinite strike was announced, said Chakraborty, the general manager of a publishing firm in Calcutta.        
	But Chakraborty, who could not beat the Gorkha Janmukti Morchas deadline to evacuate children from hostels by Monday noon, will have to wait for the strike to end for his son to switch schools. Till then, he can only worry.        
	Chakraborty is not the only city-based parent spending sleepless nights worrying about children studying in schools in the Darjeeling hills.        
	Edwina Payne, 44, said she would have brought back son Matthew from Darjeeling for good  he is a Class VII student of St Josephs School at North Point  had he been guaranteed a seat in a Calcutta school of the same standard.        
	 I am really worried about Matty. Hes had a lot of trouble adjusting to the turmoil in the hills over the past year. I want him back but which good school in the city will take him midway through an academic session? she wondered.        
	The number of schoolchildren from Calcutta studying in the hills has dwindled over the years, but they still constitute more than 25 per cent of the nearly 6,000 students staying in hostels there. Sources in Darjeeling said the majority of boarders remained in their hostels when the shutdown began on Monday.         
	Legislator and educationist Barry OBrien, who initiated a discussion on the subject in the Assembly on Monday, said he feared that most hostels would run out of rations if the strike continued for more than a week. I have urged the ministers concerned (Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and school education minister Partha Dey) to take immediate action. The security and future of so many children is at stake.        
	Father D.A. Howard, the rector of St Pauls in Darjeeling, said schools faced logistical problems in contacting parents at short notice to request them to evacuate their children before the strike began.        
	Father Kinley Tshering, the principal and rector of St Josephs, said the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha should have consulted schools before declaring the strike. Apart from Bengal, our students come from Nepal, Bhutan, Thailand, Bangladesh and other Asian countries. It (the shutdown) will ruin the reputation of the 13 schools that are over a century old and have been providing quality education.

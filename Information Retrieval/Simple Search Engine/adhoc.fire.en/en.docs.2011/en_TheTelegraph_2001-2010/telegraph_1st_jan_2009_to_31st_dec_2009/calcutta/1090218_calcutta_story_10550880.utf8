                Mridula Bhattacharya, a 34-year-old homemaker, was arrested in her Garfa Road home in Kasba on Monday in connection with the nation-wide kidney transplant racket. A probe has revealed that she used to work with Manik Chowdhury, the alleged Delhi-based kingpin. Ten people have been arrested, including Bhattacharya, since the racket was unearthed on February 2. Police are yet to nab Chowdhury.    Several lawyers agitated at Alipore court when the six men arrested for selling a government plot in Mahestala for Rs 2 crore were produced for their bail hearing. Among the six were two lawyers, Lalmohan Basu and Gaur Das Jana. The agitating lawyers alleged that their colleagues had been falsely implicated and shouted slogans against police high-handedness. Police said the protesters turned violent when the prosecution opposed the lawyers bail pleas. The agitation continued for two hours. The police said two more lawyers, Brojo Pal and Atanu Pal, were involved in the racket.    A 30-year-old man was arrested on Monday night on the charge of molesting a minor near Habra railway station. Police said the accused, Bidhan Das, is a Trinamul Congress panchayat functionary. Residents rescued the girl from an inebriated Das and beat him up before handing him over to the police. He has been remanded in judicial custody for seven days.    The driver of the pool-car that ferried Yash Lakhotia to and from school was produced before the Howrah chief judicial magistrate on Tuesday. Dharam Raut was remanded in judicial custody for 14 days. Raut was arrested on February 6 on charges of murder, abduction and criminal conspiracy. The seven-year-old boy had been kidnapped after school and murdered on January 31.    Traffic was brought to a standstill for about 30 minutes at the MM Burman Street-Bidhan Sarani crossing when around 25 autorickshaw drivers, led by Trinamul councillor Kabita Gupta, put up a blockade at 12.20pm on Tuesday. They were protesting the government directive of converting autos to LPG and also demanded an auto stand in Bidhan Sarani.     Fifteen passengers of a bus on the Howrah-Dihibhursut route were injured after it collided with a truck on the Howrah-Amta Road on Tuesday. Local residents rescued the injured and took them to hospital. Both drivers fled.    Hindusthani classical vocalist Malabika Kanan passed away in a south Calcutta nursing home around 12.30pm on Tuesday. Born in Lucknow on December 27, 1930, Kanan was one of the foremost female exponents of the khayal. She was initiated into thumri singing after her marriage to Pandit A. Kanan.

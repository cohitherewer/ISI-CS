                                                                                                               Murder charge on father
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An eight-year-old boy witnessed his stepfathers murder by his father in Howrahs Bantra on Tuesday afternoon.        
	Babusona Das, 35, was accompanying the child home from school around 2pm when he was fired by Yubaraj Mandal in Dasarath Das Lane. Police said the child and his mother had been living with Das for the past two months.        
	Amar baba amar ekhonkar babake mereche (My father killed my present father). A man called Dharmendra was with my father, police quoted the boy as saying.        
	A probe suggests personal grudge as the motive. We are trying to arrest the accused, said an officer. Residents alleged the murder had been masterminded by Madhav Barik, an alleged gangster who had fallen out with Das. A mob burnt down Madhavs shop.        
	Das had been arrested several times on charges of extortion and illegal possession of arms, the officer added.

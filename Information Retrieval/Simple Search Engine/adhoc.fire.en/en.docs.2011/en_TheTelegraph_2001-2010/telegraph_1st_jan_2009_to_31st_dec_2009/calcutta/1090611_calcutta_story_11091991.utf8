                                                                                                               Wife bait in ruse amp; rob
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Emraan Hashmi fell victim to a husband-wife rob team in The Train                                   
	A husband-wife rogue team out to catch men off guard has been busted following a lead from a victim.        
	Amit Dutta, a software engineer from Bangur, was driving past the Lakes on a March afternoon, when he needed to relieve himself. The 47-year-old stopped his Santro on Southern Avenue and headed for a pay-and-use toilet.        
	Deed done, he was about to open the door of his car and resume his journey when a young woman approached him and asked for help to locate an address.        
	Sorry, but I am not from the locality, Dutta told the attractive sari-clad woman.        
	As soon as he turned his back on her, three men appeared from nowhere and hemmed him in.        
	Why are you misbehaving with a woman? one shouted.        
	Before he could explain he had done nothing of the sort, the woman complained that he had misbehaved with her.        
	We will teach you a lesson, snarled one of the men, snatching his car key from him and slipping into the drivers seat. Dutta was bundled into the backseat and forced to sit between the two other men, while the woman slipped into the front seat.        
	The tinted windows were rolled up, the AC turned on and the car steered towards Dhakuria. The two men at the back kept raining blows on Dutta. Beaten and bruised, the software engineer could not resist the gang who robbed him of a BlackBerry, three rings fitted with precious stones, an expensive wristwatch, a gold chain and locket, and Rs 2,500 from his wallet.        
	At a deserted spot in Baishnabghata-Patuli, Dutta was pushed out. The car was later found abandoned not far from where he was dumped.        
	Once Dutta lodged a complaint, the detective department started scanning all the gangs operating in the area. They picked up the trail of a young woman who fit the description provided by Dutta.        
	The woman was traced to Nungi, in South 24-Parganas. In a swoop on Tuesday, sleuths picked up Anjali Kandal, 22, and her husband Chaitan, 34, from their house in Nungi.        
	I used my wife as bait to trap unsuspecting men, confessed Chaitan, before putting the cops on to accomplices Ranjit Das, 31, of Thakurpukur, and Bikash Das, 36, of Narendrapur, who were also arrested.        
	All the valuables stolen from Dutta were recovered, said Jawed Shamim, the citys detective chief.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Twins triumph in test of brains
                                                                                                               Twins triumph in test of brains
  - The curious case of manali and sharmili                          Manali and Sharmili at home with their mother after the announcement of the ISC results. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray
                                
	They both scored 96 per cent in ISC in the science stream. But for identical twins Sharmili and Manali Adhikari, such coincidences are no longer surprising. The students of GD Birla Centre for Education often had the same results in school examinations as well, taking turns in topping the class. They scored 97.4 and 97.8 per cent in ICSE.        
	Having performed well consistently through school, the sisters now have their eyes set on the same goal. We want to crack the IIT entrance tests. Our fondest hope is to get through to the same institution, says Sharmili, the quieter of the two.        
	Their exam preparations were centred around the competitive examinations, including AIEEE and the West Bengal Joint Entrance. They began preparing for the board exams a few months before it began. We worked late into the night, studying for seven to eight hours, Manali said.         
	The sisters always study together. We are so used to each others presence that we feel somethings missing if one of us isnt there, she added. But differences would erupt over books. They have their own set of textbooks. But I gave them only one set of reference books. They always fought over them, to the extent of tearing a book apart in two, said their mother, from their house in Nandalal Mitra Lane, near Tollygunge.         
	The duo love watching cartoons. So much so that while ISC was on, they couldnt do without half an hour of Animax in between studies.         
	With the same hairstyle and spectacles, the twins dont just look identical, but have similar tastes as well. We listen to rock music and like watching Manchester United on television, said Manali.

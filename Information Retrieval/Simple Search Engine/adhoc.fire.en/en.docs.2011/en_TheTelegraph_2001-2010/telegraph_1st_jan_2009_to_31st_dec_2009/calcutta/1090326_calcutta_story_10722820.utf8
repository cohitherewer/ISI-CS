The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Move to split test, ease load
                                                                                                               Move to split test, ease load
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Madhyamik 2010 could be made easier for students with a move afoot to split the syllabus and test candidates only on the basis of what they study in Class X.        
	The Madhyamik exam now covers whatever is taught in classes IX and X, and the proposed bifurcation  following in the footsteps of ICSE and CBSE  is aimed at reducing students stress.        
	Partha De, the school education minister, held a meeting with authorities of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education and the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education on Wednesday to discuss ways to introduce the proposed bifurcation of the Madhyamik syllabi.        
	We need to introduce certain changes in the Class IX and X syllabi and also in the question pattern of the Madhyamik. The board officials at the meeting were asked to give their opinions on the changes we need to introduce to test the candidates only on the basis of the Class X syllabi, said a senior government official.        
	In an attempt to bring Madhyamik on a par with other board exams, the state government has already split the Higher Secondary syllabus, into Class XI and XII.        
	A final decision on whether it would be possible to hold Madhyamik 2010 on the basis of the Class X syllabus will be taken after examining the feedback from the board and the council, said the official.  
	The government had initially planned to conduct the current year rsquo;s Madhyamik examinations covering only the topics taught in Class X. But the move had to be stalled following opposition from the CPM-controlled All Bengal Teachers Association.  
	 The association claimed that the Madhyamik syllabus was ldquo;compact rdquo; and bifurcation would encourage students to neglect what is taught in Class IX. ldquo;We are still opposed to splitting the Madhyamik course. But we are reviewing the pros and cons of the proposal and are ready to discuss the matter, rdquo; said Utpal Roy, the association rsquo;s general secretary.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Centre nod must for Victoria annexe
                                                                                                               Centre nod must for Victoria annexe
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                          Victoria Memorial    
	The high court on Thursday directed the Victoria Memorial authorities to seek clearance from the external affairs ministry before taking money from a foreign trust to build a cultural complex-cum-administrative office in the compound.        
	In 2005, the London-based organisation had proposed a Victoria Memorial annexe that would promote Indian art and culture.        
	The Rs 53-crore project, the blueprint of which was tabled before a division bench of the court on Thursday, ran into a legal hurdle after green activist Subhash Dutta filed a petition stating that the building could harm the monument.        
	Advocate Anindya Mitra, who represented the Memorial, said the UK-based Calcutta Tercentenary Trust would bear the cost of the cultural complex, to be developed at a cost of Rs 48 crore, while his clients would spend Rs 5 crore to build the administrative office.        
	He informed Justice B. Bhattacharya and Justice Tapan Dutta that the trust would raise the amount by taking donations from individuals and organisations abroad. The money will be deposited in the London branch of the State Bank of India, the lawyer told the court.        
	When asked by the judges whether his clients had taken the necessary permissions, Mitra said: My client will seek permission from the State. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, too, has been consulted.        
	The court directed the lawyer to ask his clients to obtain an Environmental Impact Assessment report of the project from the appropriate authorities. It will have to deal with the possible impact of the proposed project on the areas environment, said the judges.        
	Our country has enough money. Why will we collect money from foreign agencies? asked Sabyasachi Bhattacharya, a trustee of the Memorial.

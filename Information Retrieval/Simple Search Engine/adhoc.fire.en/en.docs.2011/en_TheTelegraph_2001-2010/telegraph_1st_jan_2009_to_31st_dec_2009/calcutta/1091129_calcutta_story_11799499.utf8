The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Freedom fault lines
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Freedom fault lines
										      EYE WITNESS                                        A work by Pakistani artist   Bani Abidi at the Freedom is Notional exhibition      
	Winter is the time for exhibitions and fairs, and recession or not, enough shows are on now to keep viewers busy. One can take ones pick. True to its name, from its inception, Experimenter has not been afraid of cutting edge art. Freedom is Notional, that is on till January 10, brings together an Indian (Shilpa Gupta), Pakistani (Bani Abidi) and a Bangladeshi artist settled in New York (Naeem Mohaiemen). All three are active on the international art scene, and as is obvious from the title, they raise uncomfortable questions about south Asia, where they belong.         
	Naeem Mohaiemen does not create art works in the conventional way, and his series of photographs and video documenting Islamist and Leftist rallies in Dhaka are no more than documents, Bangla rock (isnt this so familiar to us?) notwithstanding.         
	Shilpa Guptas video using 100 maps of India (Sri Lanka almost always included) drawn by an equal number of people is an ironic reflection on drawing political boundaries. Bani Abidis set of inkjet prints of intercoms used in gated communities are neat enough to have been lifted from ads. But their frigid sameness generates a sense of claustrophobia and of paranoia as well.              
	Bose Pacia Calcutta has a penchant for glossy and clever  too clever by far, one may say  art works, which they often try to back up with the help of learned essays splattered with hyphens and jargon. Calcutta-based Jayanta Roy was trained as a sculptor, and his works, in which he makes liberal use of images lifted from newspapers and thought bubbles, are lean and spare. Therein lies their strength, although the canvas wrapped in newspaper sheets is a borrowed idea. But to read so many meanings in them, as the statement does, is a gratuitous exercise.              
	Debabrata Des bronze sculptures at Sanskriti Art Gallery hark back to Ramkinkar and Rodin but he ends up creating sentimental trash. Ragged men and women lying on streets and street scenes  some large, some small  crowd the gallery space. If not anything, one expects skill from most Bengal artists. But even the modelling of these figures is quite shoddy. Little wonder each figure has a price tag. A desperate measure indeed.              
	Hugo Bona-min is a young artist from Paris in love with Calcutta. His large portraits being exhibited at Akar Prakar are composed of tempestuous brush strokes. But one does not have to be an art historian to realise that this young man is overwhelmed by Francis Bacon. Imitation may be the best form of flattery but it does not make good art.              
	Why is the exhibition at Gandhara Art Gallery titled Narratives Now! when in actuality it is just a group show. No point going into details.       SOUMITRA DAS

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bangla wants arrested four
                                                                                                               Bangla wants arrested four
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The newly-elected government in Dhaka has sought immediate deportation of four Bangladeshi assassins who were arrested in the city early this month.        
	The four  one of who has been awarded capital punishment in Bangladesh  had killed leaders of Shiekh Hasinas Awami League that has swept to power.        
	Dhaka has written to Indias external affairs ministry, asking the authorities to hand over Zakir Hussain, Nazrul Islam, Oidul Islam and Shahid Ahmed Manzir at the earliest.        
	The Centre, in turn, has sought details of the four from the state home department. S.N. Gupta, the deputy inspector-general of the CID, which has caught the four who were on the run for the past four years, has submitted a report on the convicts to the director-general of police, A.B. Vohra.        
	Acting on a tip-off that a Bangladeshi national had sneaked into the state from Nepal and been staying in the city, the CID picked up Zakir from a rented house in Garia. His statements led the sleuths to Nazrul, his brother Oidul and Manzir, who were staying in the same locality in Garia.        
	Nazrul, who had fled to Belgium, was awarded life sentence by a Bangladeshi court for killing Awami League MP Mohammad Asadullah in 2004. Oidul and Shahid, his partners in crime, were sentenced to life imprisonment.        
	Zakir was awarded life imprisonment for killing a students leader of the Awami League in the same year. All four had jumped bail during trial.        
	A source said an early deportation, as sought by Dhaka, may pose problems. The four have been charged with entering India without valid documents. Since they have not committed any other crime here, they will be pushed back like other intruders, said an officer.

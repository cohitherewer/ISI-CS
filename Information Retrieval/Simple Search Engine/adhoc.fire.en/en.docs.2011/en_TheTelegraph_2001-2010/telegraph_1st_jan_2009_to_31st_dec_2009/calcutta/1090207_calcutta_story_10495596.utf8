                                                                                                               Nationwide kidney racket busted
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Mithun (left) and Hriday                                  
	A racket involved in selling kidneys across the country has been unearthed following the arrest of two men and a woman in the city over the past few days.         
	A search is on for the Delhi-based alleged kingpin, Manik Chowdhury.         
	Police said the arrested trio  Mithun Chatterjee, 28, Hriday Kumar Dubey, 37, and Chandana Mukherjee, 44  had been engaged in the illegal trade for the past few years.        
	The cops stumbled upon the racket after one of the intended victims  Mithun, Hriday and a third accused had taken him to a city hospital on the pretext of finding him a job  got a whiff of the plot and spilled the beans. The third accused, who gave the police the slip, has been identified as Pradip Mondal.         
	Blank forms on organ transplant, purportedly issued by a prominent hospital in Delhi, and fake ration cards were seized from them, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).        
	Investigators said Suman Rudra, an unemployed youth of Jagaddal, had approached Mithun a few weeks ago for a job. On February 2, Mithun had taken him to Sealdah and introduced him to Hriday and Pradip. Mithun left after a while and the duo took Suman to Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals on the pretext of finding him a job.         
	At the hospital, Rudra became suspicious when Hriday and Pradip told him that he would have to undergo a blood test. When he quizzed the duo about the test, they told him that it was mandatory for a kidney transplant, said an officer.        
	Rudra panicked and raised an alarm, drawing the attention of the hospital guards who rushed to the spot and caught hold of Hriday. Pradip managed to escape. A police team reached the spot and arrested Hriday and Mithun, who was found loitering in the hospital.        
	Chandana was arrested on Thursday after the sleuths learnt that the kingpin used to stay in her flat in Thakurpukur during his visits to the city.        
	An Apollo spokesperson said: Two-three persons were found loitering around on February 2. They were taken to the security office and later handed over to the police.        
	Under law, only a relative of a patient who needs a kidney transplant can donate the organ. Among relatives, only parents, siblings, children and spouses can donate kidneys without permission. For the rest, the Centres consent is mandatory.        
	The cops said the racketeers used to lure poor people, especially from the city and its suburbs, with promises of jobs and money and then dupe them into selling kidneys. A probe revealed that Mithun, a resident of Jagaddal, in North 24 Parganas, had sold one of his kidneys for Rs 1 lakh in 2007.        
	Mithuns kidney was removed in a hospital in Coimbatore. Since then he has been working for the racket, said Shamim.

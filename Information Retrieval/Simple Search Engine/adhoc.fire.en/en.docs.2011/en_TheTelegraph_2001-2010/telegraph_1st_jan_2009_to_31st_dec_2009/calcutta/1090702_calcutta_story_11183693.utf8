The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Heavy showers in 48 hours
                                                                                                               Heavy showers in 48 hours
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Progress of the northern limit of monsoon                                  
	The city is set to get wetter as the weatherman predicted intensified rain across south Bengal from Wednesday night.        
	The intensity of rainfall in the city and its outskirts will increase consistently. The process may start on Wednesday night and gather momentum over the next 48 hours, said Gokul Chandra Debnath, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.         
	Independent weather analysts said the monsoon had progressed by leaps and bounds over the past 72 hours. The northern limit of monsoon (NLM) covered more than 95 per cent of the mainland on Wednesday, passing through Udaipur, Jaipur, Pilani and Hissar.         
	The NLM showed remarkable progress over the past three days, covering 45 per cent of the mainland, the chief meteorologist of a non-government agency told Metro from Delhi.         
	Independent analysts have forecast healthy rainfall through July, which might, to some extent, make up for the June deficit. The monsoon had officially arrived in the state on May 25, dragged by Cyclone Aila much in advance, but remained dormant for more than a month.         
	Going by the monsoons sudden revival, we can expect quite healthy rain throughout July. This holds for most parts of India, including Bengal, said Leela Sen, a geographer.         
	Current meteorological analysis and numerical weather prediction models suggest widespread rainfall with heavy to very heavy showers in large parts of eastern India, including parts of Bengal, agreed a senior official from the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting.        
	Calcutta received 9.8mm of rain over 24 hours (till 5.30pm on Wednesday). The maximum temperature remained a degree below normal at 32 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature, at 25.6 degrees Celsius, was normal. The discomfort index  58 degrees Celsius  was three points above normal, with the humidity ranging between 77 per cent and 97 per cent.        
	The cooler weather has dragged down the demand for power in CESC-served areas by 100-120MW since Saturday. There was no loadshedding till 5pm on Wednesday, a CESC spokesperson said in the evening.

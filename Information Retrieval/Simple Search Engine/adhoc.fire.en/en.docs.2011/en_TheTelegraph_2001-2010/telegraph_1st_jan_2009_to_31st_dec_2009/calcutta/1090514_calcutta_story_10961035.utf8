The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | At least its teasing
                                                                                                               At least its teasing
                            
	Calcutta looked airbrushed. The traffic was gone, so were the crowds, so was the smell of human bodies on a hot summer day, though the garbage heaps remained, with the crows on them unafraid. It was almost pretty.        
	Beleghata Main Road, though lined with CPM and Trinamul banners, stretching past Alochhaya cinema, past the railway bridge, past innumerable paan-bidi shops, looked the width it was. As did the Santoshpur flyover (actually it still looked tight). But it took only 20 minutes to travel from Beleghata to Santoshpur.        
	The mind boggled to think of how the pollution level had plummeted. At South City Mall a group of teenagers hung about the pavement, looking forlorn. The doors were closed. At City Centre in Salt Lake the silence was deafening.        
	It was as if something very big had been blotted out and darkness had filled its place. In the daytime.        
	So how is an election day different from a bandh?         
	In only one crucial way.         
	Despite the defective, much-maligned democracy, any visit to a booth makes clear the extraordinary sense of power, illusory or not, that people feel in the right to vote.         
	I didnt have time to cook. And it will take at least two hours for me to vote, said a woman at a Salt Lake booth, pointing at the long queue. My father-in-law was driving me crazy. He was the first one to vote in this booth at 7am, she explained.        
	In a Jadavpur booth, the elderly and the disabled delayed the process, said a voter, who welcomed the delay.        
	The vote also entitles one to promiscuity, or a little fling. It makes one whisper one thing, as the eyes hint another.         
	Please dont tell anyone  my entire family has voted for green, but everyone here knows us as red, said the young woman in Sarkarbazar, Beleghata, who went to the market but didnt get the mutton, lowering her eyes. Shob thik to? she asks her red neighbours next.        
	Better an election day than a bandh. At least its teasing.

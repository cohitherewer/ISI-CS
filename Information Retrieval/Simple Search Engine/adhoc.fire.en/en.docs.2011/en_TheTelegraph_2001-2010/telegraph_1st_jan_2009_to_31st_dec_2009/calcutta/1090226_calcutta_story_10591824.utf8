                                                                                                               Monk who sold Ferrari for fame     - Robin Sharma finds takers aplenty in town for his brand of leadership          POULOMI BANERJEE                           Robin Sharma makes a point on Wednesday evening. Picture by Rashbehari Das                                        
	The monk who sold his Ferrari (for a fabulous sum) drove into town and spread his message of leadership in typically loquacious style.        
	Have you lost pieces of yourself as you grew up from childhood? Maybe tonight is the time to find those pieces, the flamboyant author of The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari told a packed banquet hall in a five-star hotel on Wednesday evening.        
	Robin Sharma Live in association with The Telegraph, presented by Calcutta Park Street Round Table and Rotary Club of Calcutta Chowrenghee, drew 700-plus participants and saw the 44-year-old guru urging them not to be busy being busy, to manage stress and to be leaders.        
	On his first visit to Calcutta, Sharma had taken time out to visit the address of a rare leader. I couldnt leave Calcutta without having been to Mother House. It was a very moving experience, he later said.        
	The Canadian citizen described his first visit to Calcutta as beautiful though it was far from a pleasure trip. There was a lot of work and there has been a lot of interest in my kind of leadership. I hope to work with some companies here. Maybe Ill be back soon, he added.        
	The interest in his kind of leadership was all too evident at Wednesdays event. Your book has transformed my life; I had made two promises to myself, one was to see you in person, which has come true today, the other was to hug you may I? said Sudip Chakraborty from the audience.        
	The new-age guru was happy to oblige.                          
	In trademark black shirt with shoulder straps and black striped trousers, Sharmas message from the monk was: Many people who have read The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari think it is about renouncing the material world and going to the Himalayas in a loin cloth. No. Theres nothing wrong with having nice things, but dont let them be your masters.        
	The lawyer-turned-author-turned-CEO of Sharma Leadership International who has 10 bestsellers under his belt and been published in 50 countries in 40 languages is an advocate of quiet leadership.        
	A quiet leadership tip to beat the meltdown blues? Bad times call for big moves. Develop your people; take the long view.... Personally, I think this recession will continue, play for the best but be prepared for the worst.... Keep your finger on the pulse, talk to your people, spend time with friends and family.        
	And a quiet tip for the soul? Get up early, write in your journal, do what you like to do and meditate.

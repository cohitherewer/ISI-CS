  - Matrimonial website for the GeNext Bengali          A STAFF REPORTER                                                                
	Now, the search for the perfect partner is a few clicks away.                
	The first look of the site was unveiled on Saturday at Bengal Club by actress Koel Mullick and designer Agnimitra Paul, with actress Aparajita Adhya as emcee.         
	Patro Patri has been a part of my life since school days when we would read through the classifieds with much fun and interest. Now it moves a step ahead with such a website, so one can be sitting anywhere and yet reach out to all corners of the world in order to find a partner, smiled Koel.        
	The website is simple and easy to use. Once registered, the membership is of two kinds  free and paid. Free members can browse through profiles, but only paid members are able to view contact details. What is different about abppatropatri.com from other websites is that people can interact in the language they want, since the interface can be in Bengali or in English, said a spokesperson.         
	The wedding website will graduate into being not just a listing of brides and grooms but anything and everything related to marriages, the spokesperson added.        
	There will soon be names and contact numbers of sari shops, jewellery stores, furniture stores, footwear, caterers, astrologers and wedding houses. And since parents initiate most searches for their children, along with the option of online payment, select ABP classified counters across the city will accept payment. Paid packages include Rs 1,000 for three months, Rs 2,000 for six months and Rs 3,000 for a years membership.        
	Such a marriage website is advantageous because it allows access to many people at one time. Its prompt and gives you the choice to pick from a range of profiles that suit your personality best, says 26-year-old Smita, on the lookout for a suitable boy.        
	Bivas Chakrabarti knows what an online matchmaker can do. I found my wife Sudipta through such a website two years ago. Its a good platform to choose because everyone there is dedicated to getting married. Plus, with a brand like ABP, the trust factor is very high and people will be more than willing to go for it, says the 35-year-old.

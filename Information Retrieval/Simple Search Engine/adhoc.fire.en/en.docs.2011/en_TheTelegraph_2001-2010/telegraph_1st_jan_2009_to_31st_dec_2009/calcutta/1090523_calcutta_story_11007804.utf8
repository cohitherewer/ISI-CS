The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pressure belt key to monsoon
                                                                                                               Pressure belt key to monsoon
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A low-pressure belt over central Bay of Bengal, responsible for the current dry spell, can also provide early relief from the heat by hastening the monsoon into the state.        
	Met officials said on Friday the south-west monsoon had advanced over the Arabian Sea and might enter Kerala in a day or two. The monsoon normally arrives in the southern state around June 1.        
	The course of the monsoon and the date of its arrival in Bengal will depend largely on the behaviour of the low-pressure system, a Met official said. Under normal circumstances, the monsoon arrives in north Bengal on June 5 and south Bengal on June 8.        
	Though its too early to predict, there are chances of the low-pressure system bringing the monsoon to the state before the scheduled date, the official added.        
	A partly cloudy sky on Friday kindled hopes but brought no relief from the heat. The dry spell is likely to continue into the weekend, with the Met office ruling out chances of rain in the next 24 hours.        
	We are not expecting any rain on Saturday as the low-pressure system will prevent incursion of moisture from the sea. The system may intensify into a depression and move towards Bengal, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.

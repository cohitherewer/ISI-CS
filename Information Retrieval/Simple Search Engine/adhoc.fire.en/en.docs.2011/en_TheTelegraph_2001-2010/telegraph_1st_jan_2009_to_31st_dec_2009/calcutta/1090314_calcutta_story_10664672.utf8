The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Govts salary bait for schools
                                                                                                               Govts salary bait for schools

	Christian missionary schools whose teachers get dearness allowance (DA) from the government could soon be relieved of their entire salary burden. But the price they fear they may pay is loss of administrative and academic freedom.        
	The government is examining a proposal from the CPM-controlled All Bengal Teachers Association (ABTA) to bring the 60-odd private Christian missionary schools that get DA support completely under its fold.         
	If the proposal is accepted, the government will pay the full salaries of the teaching and non-teaching staff of schools like St Xaviers, Don Bosco, Loreto and St Augustine. At present, it picks up 91 per cent of the DA bill.        
	Although the proposal doesnt include any riders, officials of some schools feel theres more to the governments missionary position than meets the eye.        
	We now have the freedom to select teachers and decide what our fee structure should be. More importantly, we choose our curriculum or tailor it to our needs. It is unlikely that we will be able to retain our administrative and academic freedom if the proposal is accepted, said the principal of a south Calcutta school.        
	The school education department has informally sounded out some school principals on the proposal but officials are keeping the governments views under wraps, presumably to avert collective opposition to the move.         
	 All I can say as of now is that we are examining the proposal from the teachers association, said Sukumar Mahapatra, the joint secretary of the school education department.        
	The associations logic behind pushing the proposal is that it will benefit the teaching community in terms of securing their earnings. It claims students and parents will gain, too, because salary support from the government will put a cap on fees.        
	 Although the government contributes 91 per cent of the DA that is paid to teachers and non-teaching staff of these schools, the authorities have not stopped increasing their fees. Besides, they are depriving teachers of their legitimate benefits, said a senior leader of the association, the largest body of secondary school teachers in Bengal.         
	The city has witnessed repeated protests by parents over the past few months against the hike in fees by various schools. Parents and guardians fear these schools will increase their fees again after the state government accepts the proposals of the Fifth Pay Commission.         
	According to statistics available with the school education department, the government spends Rs 30 crore per year on the 5,000-odd teaching and non-teaching staff of the Christian missionary schools. The annual outgo could rise to Rs 67 crore if the proposal to pick up the full salary bill is accepted.         
	 It will be a burden on the state exchequer, but we are pushing for it because we think it will benefit everybody, said Utpal Roy, the general secretary of the teachers association.        
	The retired principal of a private school said it was a politically motivated proposal. The Left has a history of trying to interfere in the financial, administrative and academic affairs of schools.        
	The other big fear is that this will pave the way for the ABTAs entry into schools.

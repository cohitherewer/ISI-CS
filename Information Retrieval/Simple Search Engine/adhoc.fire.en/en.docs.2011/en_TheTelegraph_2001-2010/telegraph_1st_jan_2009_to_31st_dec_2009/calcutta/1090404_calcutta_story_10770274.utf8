The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ad hoc payment to open club office, bar
                                                                                                               Ad hoc payment to open club office, bar
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday directed Calcutta Ladies Golf Club to make an ad hoc payment of Rs 50,000 to the civic body by April 7 to re-open its office and restaurant-cum-bar.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) sealed the office and the bar on March 24, alleging that the authorities of the Maidan club owed Rs 96,200 in licence fee and other civic charges for the period between 2005 and 2009.        
	The CMC issued a distress warrant against the club last November. The warrant empowers a civic body to seal the premises of a defaulter.        
	Justice Tapen Sen said in his order on Friday: Within 24 hours of receiving the ad hoc payment, the civic authorities will break the seal on the restaurant-cum-bar and the office room in the presence of the club president.        
	The distress warrant will be stayed after the club makes the payment, said Justice Sen.        
	In 2005, the club authorities had written to the CMC seeking a licence to run the restaurant-cum-bar on the premises.        
	The civic body had learnt that the restaurant-cum-bar was being run by the club for the past few years. Moreover, the club was not paying other civic taxes, said the CMCs lawyer, Alok Ghosh.        
	According to him, the civic body had soon after asked the club authorities to pay the licence fee and other charges but without any result.        
	The club moved the high court challenging the validity of the civic seal on the office and the eatery. Appearing for the club, advocate A.C. Kar said: Since the club is situated on land belonging to the army, the civic authorities have no right to claim fees.        
	The CMC lawyer argued: But who is cleaning the garbage? Who is removing the sewage? The club is earning money selling food and liquor. Why will it not pay the licence fee? The case will come up for hearing on June 6.

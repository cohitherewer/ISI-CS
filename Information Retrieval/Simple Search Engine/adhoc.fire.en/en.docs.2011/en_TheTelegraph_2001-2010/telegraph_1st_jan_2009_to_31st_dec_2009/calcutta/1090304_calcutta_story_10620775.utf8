The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Strike call by Writers workers
                                                                                                               Strike call by Writers workers
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Writers Buildings employees opposed to the CPM-dominated Co-ordination Committee have called a strike at the secretariat on Wednesday. Their demands include payment of arrears from January 2006 while implementing the fifth pay commissions recommendations.        
	Six employees bodies, under the umbrella of Mahakaran Sangram Committee, took out a rally in support of the strike during the recess at Writers on Tuesday. The Co-ordination Committee also organised a rally during the recess to protest the strike call. Police had to put up barricades on the ground floor of the building to prevent any untoward incident.        
	Members of the six organisations will not attend office at Writers Buildings tomorrow, said Partha Chattopadhyay, a general secretary of the Trinamul Congress- backed State Government Employees Federation.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen said those who would not report for work on Wednesday would have to apply for casual leave.        
	P.B. Nag, a general secretary of the State Government Employees Federation, alleged that Co-ordination Committee members had tried to assault supporters of his union while they were peacefully agitating in support of the strike. The strike is politically motivated, said Ananta Bandopadhyay, the general secretary of the Co-ordination Committee.

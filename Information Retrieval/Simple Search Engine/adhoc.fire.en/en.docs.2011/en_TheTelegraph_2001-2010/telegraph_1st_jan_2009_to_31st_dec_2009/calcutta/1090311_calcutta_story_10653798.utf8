	The report The sinking feeling, January 16, regarding the chances of parts of Calcutta sinking is an eye-opener. It seems the governments efforts to fill up all ponds and lakes in the city and its suburbs and turn them into parks and playgrounds have paid off.             
	Added to this, builders show a keen desire to construct highrise buildings on local ponds. They fill up the water bodies in the dead of the night despite unanimous opposition from local residents.           
	Being a student and a future citizen of the country, I am concerned to learn of the horrifying prospect of my city sinking because of a fall in the ground water level. The fact that the ground water level has fallen by 7 to 11m in 45 years bears testimony to the mindless exploitation of the citys underground water reserves.           
	But one cant blame the government alone. In Bengal, the age-old tradition of installing a borewell in every household whether required or not continuous and has compounded the problem.           
	Now methods like rainwater harvesting and planting of trees should be undertaken to repair the damage. Measures also need to be taken to prevent further damage. This will refill the ground water and increase the height of the water table and help overcome a disaster in waiting.

	Apropos the report Hot-water attack on kids, January 22, it is shocking to hear that a neighbour had thrown hot water on Class II students of a school in Salt Lake. If the children were undisciplined, the neighbour should have complained to the principal or at most, scolded them. But her action shows how insensitive and inhuman she is. The woman and her employers even defended the action. If little kids wont play and make noise, who will? The burden of studies is ruining their childhood anyway and now such insensitive people have joined forces to eradicate innocence.             
	Amrita Mallik,

	The incident of throwing hot water on kids is most distressing. It was a barbaric act and the culprit must be arrested and given exemplary punishment. However, while setting up schools, especially in residential areas, care must be taken to locate the premises in a way that it does not disturb neighbours. This would help avoid such unpleasant incidents.

	The action of the housekeeper is unpardonable. If the children had thrown stones at the adjacent house, it could have been reported to the school authorities. Kids need to be disciplined with affection and advice. They may make mischief, but before retaliating other avenues should be explored to discipline them. What if the burn injuries of the kids had turned serious? Moreover, the house owners argument that schools should not be set up in residential areas is not justifiable. Schools need students and children need schools near their homes. So residential areas should always have schools.

	Calcutta was once famed for its humanity, hospitality and warmth. Now, with a huge influx of people from other states and Bangladesh, dacoity, looting, robbery and extortion are on the rise in the city. The report Rs 1.27cr booty recovered, 5 held, January 21, is a glaring example of the state of affairs. More efforts should be made to curb crime. Calcutta police must, however, be lauded for nabbing the accused in the Fairlie Place robbery.             
	B.N. Bose,
  Dum Dum Park           
	We have heard from our elders that Calcutta police was once compared with the Scotland Yard. The polices handling of the Fairlie Place dacoity case shows why. The lawmen not only nabbed the culprits within a few days, but also recovered most of the loot. Such prompt action enhances peoples belief in the police.           
	Sourish Misra, 
  Salt Lake                   
	Apropos the report Axe attack on grandparents, January 20, the 14-year-old boy who attacked his grandparents needs counselling. He has said he wanted to avenge the death of his father, who was allegedly driven to suicide by his family. The boys mother should have also shown restraint about blaming her in-laws for her husbands death in front of her son. Her constant accusations may have triggered the boys behaviour.

	The report Fathers old wound bleeds, January 26, along with photographs of tram tracks was a reminder of the pathetic condition of city roads and underscored how the Calcutta Tram Corporation (CTC) had failed to maintain the tracks. It is appaling that in spite of a youth being impaled by a jutting metal strip a few years ago, the worn-out tracks are still in a deplorable state. Metro has highlighted the condition of the tracks many times but the authorities cannot be shaken out of their stupor. The funds crunch excuse offered by the CTC regarding repairing the tracks rings hollow. It should seek the state governments help in that case.             
	Ratan Kumar Halder, 
  Behala           
	I thank god for the miraculous escape of a taxi driver and his passenger when the edge of tram track pierced a taxi. The CTC, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation or the city police shied off responsibility for the incident. Filing a criminal or civil case against the CTC is a cumbersome process. But the government should take immediate steps to remove such death traps from city roads.

	Apropos the article Bird peril on flight path (January 24), it is common sense that birds will be attracted to waste generated by eateries, markets and water bodies, which are mushrooming on the airport periphery. The bird peril can be easily avoided if the three adjoining municipalities adopt precautionary measures.             
	Govinda Bakshi,
  Budge Budge                     
	Apropos Revenge whiff in boy kidnap January 31, no words are strong enough to condemn the gruesome killing of Yash Lakhotia in Howrah. The law and order in the state is deteriorating with goons ruling the roost. The police cut a sorry figure in curbing crime. The murderers of little Yash should be sent to the gallows.

	The report Sinking baby hearts revived (January 29) about two mothers with their babies with life-threatening congenital heart conditions in their laps after a successful surgery made heartwarming reading. Thanks to Dr Devi Shetty whose brain child the hospital is, heart patients in eastern India benefit from the expertise of the specialists here. Patients from far-away places too crowd this hospital because of sophisticated facilities available here.             
	P.B. Saha,
  Salt Lake             
	Subhankar Mukherjee, in his letter The politics of culture (March 4) mentioned the poem Ulanga Raja as composed by Shakti Chattopadhaya. I would like to point out that the poem has been written by Nirendranath Chakraborty.

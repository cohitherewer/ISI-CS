The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Financial brakes on Audi roll-out
                                                                                                               Financial brakes on Audi roll-out
          ANASUYA BASU                          The Audi Q7. The launch of the companys first dealership in Calcutta has been pushed back                                  
	The launch of the first Audi dealership in the city has been delayed. Imperial Auto, which was supposed to open a world-class showroom at Tagore Park on the EM Bypass in January, has pulled out because of financial reasons.        
	Shruti Bagaria, the proprietor of Imperial Auto and also Imperial Honda, said: I am not in a position to make an investment to the tune of Rs 15 crore needed to open an Audi showroom. I am not prepared to commit such a huge sum of money as I am not assured of the returns.         
	Bettina Benhart, the Audi spokesperson, said in Mumbai: We are in the process of finalising a new dealer for the city. Yes, the investments for an Audi dealership would be huge but since we enter into a long-term enduring partnership, the returns are calculated to the last detail. The east is a very promising and growing market for us. We will be in the east very soon with a new dealer.         
	Audi has dealerships in Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chandigarh, Chennai, Delhi, Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Kochi, Mumbai and Pune. It plans to add 10 more dealerships in India, including one in Calcutta.        
	Imperial Auto had started constructing the showroom. We completed the foundation work, said Bagaria, who had invested Rs 75 lakh in the project.         
	The showroom was supposed to have 6,000sq ft floor space and showcase the entire Audi line-up  A4, A6, A8 sedans, the Q7 SUV and the sports car TT Coupe, prices for which range from Rs 30 lakh to Rs 1.25 crore.

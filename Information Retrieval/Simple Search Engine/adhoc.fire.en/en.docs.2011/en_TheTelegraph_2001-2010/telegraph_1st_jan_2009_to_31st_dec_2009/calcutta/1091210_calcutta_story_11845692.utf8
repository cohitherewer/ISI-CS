                      Stepping stone to success                    Designed to be the ultimate reference book for students aspiring to clear various competitive examinations, Barry OBriens General Knowledge Manual 2010 combines the advantages of any specialised subject textbook along with that of an up-to-date encyclopaedia. It has been conceived and developed on the basis of the particular requirements of competitive examinations conducted by Union and State Public Service Commissions, Indian Forest Services, Indian Engineering Services, Combined Defence Services, National Defense Academy (NDA), SSC, Bank Probationary Officers Examinations, Reserve Bank of India Officers Examinations, Railway Recruitment Board, Special Class Railway Apprentices (SCRA), LIC, GIC, AAOs, the various MBA/MCA/BCA/BBA entrance examinations, as well as other administrative examinations. Presented in simple, systematic and student-friendly style, its objective is to cover the vast subject of general knowledge in a structured and useful manner, with special focus on the current trend of questions asked. Covering a spectrum of important and relevant topics in each area of study in 12 different sections, the book provides a current, reliable and authentic treatment of all topics. It also includes exclusive sections on IQ and Logic, Personality Developement, Communication Skills and Better English. Multiple-choice questions at the end of each section will help students revise and recapitulate every chapter. Value is added to the core material in the form of supporting diagrams, illustration and interesting tidbits of information. This evening, Somnath Chatterjee will formally launch the book. A concise version of the book will also be released.

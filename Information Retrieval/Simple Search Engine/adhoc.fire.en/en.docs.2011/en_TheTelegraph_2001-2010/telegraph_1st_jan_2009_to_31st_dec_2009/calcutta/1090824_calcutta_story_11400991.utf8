The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Look, Im on a metro with a view!
                                                                                                               Look, Im on a metro with a view!

	As Metro Railway embarked on an extended 5.83km journey to the south on Sunday, Calcuttans used to tunnel vision set out in droves to check out the upor diye jawa Metro (the Metro that travels on elevated tracks). Garia Bazar to Dum Dum in 41 minutes for Rs 12 was as much an attraction as the excitement of a first-day-first-show. Metro was there to witness the thrill of the first ride and the teething trouble commuters faced.        
	THE CARNIVAL        
	Sonarpur resident Subir Dutta had promised daughters Srimoyee and Nandini, aged 12 and 9, more than a year ago that he would take them on a joyride on the new Metro after it was inaugurated. He kept his word on Sunday, trooping into Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar) station with wife and daughters to undertake the 18-minute journey to Tollygunge (Mahanayak Uttam Kumar) and back.        
	The Duttas were not the only excited family around. Hundreds came to check out the Metro that gives passengers a ringside view of terraces old and new all along the route. Some stood up on the seats and leant on the glass windows and doors watching the train go by their homes, and roads through which they had travelled on smoke-belching buses and autos all these years.        
	I had asked my wife to try and spot me and my son on the train from our terrace at Lakshmikantapur Colony, smiled 33-year-old Anirban Chowdhury.        
	He called his wife  the elevated tracks ensure uninterrupted cellphone connectivity  and started waving as the train neared his residence. She would have needed hawk-eye vision to spot her husband and son, though.        
	At each of the four stations between Garia Bazar and Tollygunge, cellphone cameras went click-click as a train entered.         
	THE CONFUSION        
	If commuters gave a carnival touch to Day One of the new Metro service, slip-ups by the Metro authorities triggered confusion.        
	Only two of the 18 trains operating on Sunday displayed the complete route map above the windows. But the map, which mentions Shahid Khudiram (Birji)  and not Kavi Nazrul (Garia Bazar), where trains are now terminating  as the last station on the southern side, left some commuters confused.        
	There was more confusion in store with stations being referred to by the grand names of Netaji, Masterda Surya Sen, Gitanjali and Kavi Nazrul. Cant they call them Kudghat, Bansdroni, Naktala and Garia Bazar till we get used to the new route? grumbled a passenger.         
	Commuters also complained about the lack of on-board announcements after Tollygunge. At Garia Bazar, Metro officials were forced to use the PA system to ask passengers to get off.        
	The old fare charts remained at all stations except those on the extended route. Those manning the counters referred to a list of the new stations every time someone asked for a ticket to a destination on the extended route.        
	We will sort out these problems by the end of this month, promised J.K. Mitra, the chief operating officer of Metro Railway.

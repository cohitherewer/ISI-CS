                                                                                                               Stove burst kills teen
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 13-year-old girl was killed and four of her family members were injured when a stove burst in a one-room house in Mollapara, under Mahestala police station, early on Wednesday.        
	Golap Khatoon was declared dead on arrival at MR Bangur Hospital. Her mother Masooda Khatoon, 35, sister Safi Khatoon, 10, and three-year-old cousin Masoora were admitted to hospital with over 80 per cent burns.        
	Masoodas husband Sahabuddin Molla, an autorickshaw driver, was discharged after first-aid. His six-year-old son Sirajul was unhurt.        
	My wife was preparing breakfast on the stove when it burst, igniting clothes kept in a heap next to it. The children were sleeping in a corner of the room. I tried to save them but the fire spread too quickly, said Molla. Sirajul managed to slip out and raise an alarm.

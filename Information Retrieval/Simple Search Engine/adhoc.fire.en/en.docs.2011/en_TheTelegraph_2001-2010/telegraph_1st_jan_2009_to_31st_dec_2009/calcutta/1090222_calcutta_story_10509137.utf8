                                                                                                               Next weekend you can be at...   Angapani
                                                
	Four of us revived our college adventure club, SNOW, and set off on a trek across the Singalila mountain range in west Sikkim. Our destination was Angapani, a clearing inside the hill forest that offers an excellent view of Mt Kanchenjunga, Mt Kabru and Mt Pandim, and if your are lucky, even the majestic Mt Everest.         
	Day I        
	Our trek started from Uttarey, a hamlet in west Sikkim, accessible by road. We arrived in Siliguri and hired a car. After a rather bumpy four-hour ride, we reached Jorthang. As soon as we stepped out of the car we were greeted by a cold January wind that lashed our faces.         
	Our next destination was Uttarey, but it was too late to set off for the village. We decided to visit Ravangla, a three-hour drive from Jorthang.         
	Enveloped in mist, Ravangla appeared as a mystical town, with Buddhist monks on the streets carrying long trumpets. We visited the magnificent Ravangla Monastery situated atop a hill and marvelled at the intricate woodcarvings, beautiful paintings, sprawling courtyard and delicate sculptures.        
	Day II         
	We hired a jeep at Ravangla to take us to Uttarey. We passed by lush orange orchards and dark conifer forests, the morning sun playing hide-and seek with wisps of silvery mist. We stopped our jeep at gurgling streams and waterfalls, relishing the cold spray and refreshing ourselves.         
	We reached Uttarey at 2pm and made preparations to start our trek the same day. Those who wish to freshen up before starting their trek may check into a resort at Uttarey, but the rates are a little steep.        
	We hired two porters and bought food rations from the village. Darkness descends very quickly in the mountains, so we hurriedly packed our mountaineering gear and began our trek.         
	It was a tough climb right from the beginning. We passed through hill terraces, leaving behind tiny mountain huts.         
	After a three-hour climb, we reached Lamha Pokhri, our first tenting spot. We pitched our tents on a small clearing near a stream.         
	A kitchen tent was put up near our living tents. The steep climb had ensured a healthy appetite and we tucked into roasted chicken and khichdi and washed them down with red wine before retiring for the day.         
	Day III         
	We woke early and by the time the sun kissed the horizon, we were ready with our tents packed and our rucksacks slung on our backs.         
	It was a hard but exhilarating trek through dense alpine forests. We spotted silver firs, oaks and birches on our way. The path was narrow and at times we had to slash our way through prickly thickets with a kukri (a long knife used by the Nepalese).         
	We reached Angapani in the afternoon. The place is breathtaking. The sky was clear blue, a novelty for city dwellers like us.         
	There were lofty peaks all around us, and the view almost intoxicating. Mt Kanchenjunga, Mt Pandim and several other peaks dazzled in the mid-day sun. We pitched our tents on a plateau and lay staring at the magnificent mountains.         
	A crisp winter wind was blowing, but the sun kept us warm. We watched the sun set into the mountains in picture-postcard perfection and suddenly we were enveloped in darkness. We retired into our cosy tents as the mountain air howled outside.         
	Day IV         
	The next morning, we stepped out of our tents into a different world.         
	It had snowed the night before, covering the green plateau in a glistening white cloak, it seemed. As the mist lifted, one by one the lofty peaks came into view, glowing golden in the morning sunlight.         
	Around 7am we began our descent. There was snow all along the path, making it slippery and dangerous.         
	The trek down was a greater challenge than the climb. A mere loose foothold could have spelt disaster.         
	All too soon, we were back in Uttarey. The mighty peaks and green vista had rejuvenated our senses and the pure mountain air had filled our lungs. We went back home with the promise of heeding the call of the wild again, soon.              
	Going   
	Take a bus or train to Siliguri or a flight to Bagdogra. Cars and jeeps are available from Siliguri for Ravangla and Uttarey. Trek your way to Angapani  
	Staying  
	Hotels and resorts are available at Uttarey. You can also hire mountaineering gear and buy rations for your trek        (METRO ON SUNDAY

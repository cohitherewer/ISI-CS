                                                                                                               The City Diary
                Calcutta High Court on Wednesday increased the maintenance of a 39-year-old divorced woman and her 15-year-old son by Rs 1,000 on the condition that she would allow the boy to spend a day every week with his father. Aveek Banerjee, a CESC engineer, had stopped paying Rs 4,000 as monthly maintenance to former wife Rita because she did not allow him to meet their son.    The first day of Madhyamik 2009 passed off peacefully on Wednesday, Mamata Ray, the president of West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, said. Examinees in some centres in south and central Calcutta, however, complained of power cuts.    Noor Alam, 22, died after being hit by a private bus on route 12B in Garden Reach on Wednesday. Residents put up a roadblock for an hour, refusing to let police take the body to hospital.

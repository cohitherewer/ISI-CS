The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tales of courage and conviction
                                                                                                               Tales of courage and conviction
          A STAFF REPORTER                            Sahina receives the Father Sheehy Memorial Scholarship; (below) Soumendu receives the Prativa Sen Gupta Memorial Scholarship                                 
	Soumendu Sundar Mukherjees Higher Secondary (HS) exams were knocking at his door when tragedy struck. His father, the sole bread earner for a family of three, died after a brief illness. But Soumendu of Rampurhat Jitendralal Vidyabhaban wiped away his tears and gave it his best shot  thats what his father would have wanted. The results are there for all to see  the young braveheart scored 96 in his HS, ranked 82 in engineering and 13 in medical in WBJEE this year and is now studying in the ISI.         
	Chandrima Chakrabartty is barely 18, but she has already learnt about life the hard way. She and her family of four barely make ends meet on a monthly income of Rs 1,200 (her father is a purohit). But that didnt stop her from scoring 90 per cent in Madhyamik and 84 per cent in HS. Driven by the dream of serving those in need, she chose to study nursing and ranked 97 in the state nursing entrance exam. She is now studying nursing in Calcutta Medical College.        
	These were just two of the remarkable tales of courage and conviction that emerged during the first leg of The Telegraph School Awards For Excellence, held on Saturday at Vidya Mandir. Soumendu and Chandrima won The Prativa Sen Gupta Memorial Scholarship and The Telegraph Education Foundation Scholarship. In its 13th edition, the final ceremony of the annual awards organised by The Telegraph Education Foundation (TTEF) will be held at the Science City auditorium on August 29.        
	The annual awards ceremony was also witness to other tales that, in the words of veteran academic and TTEF trustee Sukanta Chaudhuri, filled us with hope and inspiration, and yet shock, that such sacrifice and deprivation is part of the education scene.        
	He was referring to the likes of Suprova Chakraborty of Tiljala Balika Vidyalaya who pays for her own education and her mothers medical bills by working as a part-time tutor. Or Sahina Akhtar, whose father is a daily wage labourer, who has had to give up her dream of studying chemistry, to study English in Bethune College. I didnt get chemistry in any of the other good government college I applied to, but its okay, she smiled bravely and has re-adjusted her goal to the IAS.        
	Or maybe Chandreyee Dutta Chowdhury of Hartleys High School who suffers from an untreatable visual impairment, which means she cant study at night and has to use heavy low vision glasses to read or watch TV. Ive had to give up drawing and even dancing as the vigorous steps harm the retina. Some people underestimate me, others underestimate the severity of my problem but I dont care, smiled the Class XI student who received a certificate of honour for courage.        
	Several schools shared the spotlight with the students as certificates of merit and honour were awarded in 11 other categories ranging from academic performance to social service, sports to employee performance.        
	But these efforts remain a drop in the ocean, maintained Chaudhuri. Another significant drop in the ocean this time at The Telegraph School Awards For Excellence will be the allocation of Rs 5 lakh towards developing education in the Aila-hit parts of Bengal.

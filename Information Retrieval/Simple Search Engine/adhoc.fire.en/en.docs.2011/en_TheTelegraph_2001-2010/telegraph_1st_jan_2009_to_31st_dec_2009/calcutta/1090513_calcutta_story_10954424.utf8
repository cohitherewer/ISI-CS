The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Chaos greets election party
                                                                                                               Chaos greets election party
        OUR BUREAU                          Poll personnel protest mismanagement at Netaji Indoor Stadium on Tuesday. (Pradip Sanyal)                                        
	Kallol Sen reached Netaji Indoor Stadium at 9.30am. But even at 4pm, the 45-year-old presiding officer could not figure out whether the polling officers of the booth he has been assigned had turned up or not.        
	Exasperated with the mismanagement at the distribution centre for Calcutta North constituency, Sen shouted out: Amar meyer biye hochche je ami eto chhota-chhuti korbo (is my daughter getting married that I have to run around like this)? It is the duty of the election authorities to guide us.        
	Sens plight was shared by the 4,500-odd officials who will man the 1,646 polling booths in Calcutta North on Wednesday.        
	In the absence of guidelines, the poll personnel flocked to the enquiry counter but it was empty for most part of the day. To make matters worse, there was no arrangement for drinking water at the stadium.        
	There is utter mismanagement. Presiding officers are yet to get their appointment letters and identity cards, which should have been issued during the training, said Munir Iqbal Qureshi, a presiding officer who was waiting to collect his polling material.        
	Around 3pm, the officials gheraoed the offices of assistant returning officers. Police had to be called in to tackle the situation.        
	An assistant returning officer standing outside the stadium was heard talking over the phone to his counterparts who were still stuck inside the distribution centre: I have managed to escape. You, too, leave, or else people will beat you up.        
	Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen blamed the weather for the mismanagement. Our representatives reached the venue late because of the rain.        
	Security        
	Senior officers of the city police, along with central forces, visited more than 104 supersensitive booths and checked the strongrooms where electronic voting machines will be kept after polling.        
	The officers visited certain pockets in Topsia, Tangra, Phoolbagan, Beleghata, New Market and Taltala to gauge the ground situation and decide whether additional forces would be required on the poll day, said a source at Lalbazar.        
	Chief electoral officer Sen said security for the third phase of polling in the state was unprecedented.... The commission considers the areas going to polls on Wednesday sensitive and vulnerable.        
	Our control rooms have started functioning. Complaints are being tracked in real time by four dedicated squads, Sen added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City drive against Maoists
                                                                                                               City drive against Maoists
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police have launched a drive to identify the members of the CPI (Maoist) active in the city.        
	Officers of the special branch, the intelligence wing of the city police, have identified some underdeveloped pockets where Maoists have struck roots. The branch has also been probing the activities of Gour Chakrabarty, the spokesperson for the banned outfit who was arrested last month.        
	Maoists are exploiting the grievances of the residents of the underdeveloped pockets to spread their influence in the city. They followed the same tactic in West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia, said an officer.        
	Among the places where Maoists have been found to be active are the shanties of Maniktala, Ultadanga, Tangra, Kasba and Tiljala. Sleuths have also learnt that outfit members are trying to spread their network among the labourers of closed jute mills along the Hooghly.        
	Officers of all law enforcement agencies said they had been aware about the presence of Maoists in the city for some time. A number of posters bearing the name of the organisation were found pasted on the walls of Writers Buildings and Presidency College.        
	The police said Maoists in Calcutta had been working under the banner of front organisations, such as the Revolutionary Youth League and Ganapratirodh Mancha.        
	The members of these groups claim they are sympathisers of the CPI (Maoists) and have no direct link with the outfit. But in the meetings they organise in various localities, they openly advocate the cause of the Maoists, said a sleuth. Some residents have joined the organisation. We will try to isolate them from the Maoists.

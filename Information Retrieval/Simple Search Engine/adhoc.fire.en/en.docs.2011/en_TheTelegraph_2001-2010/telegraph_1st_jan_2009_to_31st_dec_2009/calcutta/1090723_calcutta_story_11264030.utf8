The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Drug resistance leads to rise in malaria cases
                                                                                                               Drug resistance leads to rise in malaria cases
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              
	State health and civic officials have found the incidence of malaria, particularly the malignant variant, has increased in the city compared with last year, despite anti-mosquito drives by the civic body.        
	The officials suspect patient resistance to the drug chloroquine is the main reason for the spurt in malaria cases.        
	Following a report submitted by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) in the Assembly through the state health department, which said infection of malignant malaria-causing Plasmodium falciparum parasite was higher this year than in 2008, the health department had convened an emergency meeting on Wednesday.         
	Between January and June 2008, 47,000-odd blood slides were tested. Of them, 96 tested positive for falciparum infection. During the same period in 2009, around 50,000 samples were tested and 857 were positive.        
	On Wednesday, officials of the health department and the CMC and members of the health advisory committee met to discuss whether an alternative treatment should be introduced in the face of increasing chloroquine resistance in the city.        
	Civic health officials suggested the drug-resistant patients be put on artemisenine combination therapy (ACT), which is costlier. The health department accepted the suggestion and also decided to conduct a survey of the 80 wards in the city proper to ascertain the spread of the resistance.         
	According to mayoral council member (health) Subodh De, chloroquine resistance had been detected in Sealdah and Burrabazar.         
	Chief municipal health officer DebDwaipayan Chattopadhyay said if a resistant patient was put on chloroquine therapy, the medicine would have no effect on the parasite. They will continue multiplying and may cause death.        
	Secondly, mosquitoes sucking on such a patients blood would spread the disease to others. Since civic wards are contiguous, it can be assumed that chloroquine resistance is not limited to just these two wards, De said.        
	Civic health officials said Rajabazar, Taltala, Ballygunge, Tiljala, Topsia, Chetla, Kalighat and Behala were found to be malaria-prone. Of 100 blood samples from these pockets, the malaria parasite was detected in at least 80.         
	A high percentage of falciparum infection has been found in Kumartuli, Sealdah, Rajabazar, Taltala and Kalighat. Around 25 per cent of the positive samples tested positive for falciparum.

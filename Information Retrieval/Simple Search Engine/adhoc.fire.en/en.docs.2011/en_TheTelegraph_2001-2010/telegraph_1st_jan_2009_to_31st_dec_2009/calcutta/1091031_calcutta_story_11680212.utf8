The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Strike call by lawyers
                                                                                                               Strike call by lawyers
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Around 5,000 lawyers of the high court will strike work from November 3 to 10 to step up their demand for immediate filling up of 18 vacant posts of judges.        
	Calcutta High Court Bar Association leaders said they were aware of an apex court order banning strikes by lawyers but an increasing number of pending cases had left them with no option but to call the ceasework.        
	More than 600 cases come up for hearing in the high court daily. The ceasework  effectively of six days, as the court will remain closed on November 7 and 8 for weekend recess  will result in at least 3,600 cases being added to the list of 3.5 lakh pending ones.        
	We are aware of the 1995 Supreme Court order proscribing strike by lawyers but circumstances have forced us to call the ceasework, said Sardar Amjad Ali, the president of the bar association.         
	Our association has requested the Supreme Court and the central government several times to fill up the vacant posts. But there has been no action yet, Ali added.        
	Asked about the implications of defying the ban order, Ali cited a Supreme Court judgment that had set a deadline for appointment to vacant posts of judges. In 1993, the Supreme Court had ruled that a judges post must be filled up within nine months of it falling vacant.        
	The high court now has 40 judges, 18 short of the sanctioned strength of 58. Sources said the court had never functioned with its full strength of judges.        
	Two years ago, the court administration had sent a panel of eight lawyers to the Supreme Court for appointment as judges. Only one name was cleared for appointment, Ali said.        
	Around the same time, Allahabad High Court had got appointment to all its 28 vacant posts cleared.        
	Lawyers blame the state government for the delay in appointment. The state government is not co-operating, said Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, the vice-president of the bar association.

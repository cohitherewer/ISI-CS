                Fifty first-year students of Muralidhar Girls College, who were not allowed to appear in the Part I exams after falling short on attendance, gheraoed the principal on Tuesday afternoon. The girls have been agitating since Monday evening. Students with less than 10 per cent attendance want us to allow them to sit for the exams, said principal Manjusha Tarafdar. The gherao was lifted at 11.15pm after police intervened. Students of Jogamaya College and City College recently gheraoed their principals for extended periods with the same demand. The Calcutta University authorities and the West Bengal Principals Council condemned the students action. We will not let the agitations affect the quality of undergraduate education, said Dhrubojyoti Chattopadhyay, the pro-vice chancellor of the university. Ninety-eight per cent students have the required attendance, the remaining two per cent are creating the problem, said Anjan Sengupta, the joint secretary of the principals council.     Two persons were killed and more than a dozen injured in mishaps in the city on Tuesday morning. An autorickshaw carrying 15 passengers turned turtle on Diamond Harbour Road near the Kushberia crossing while trying to overtake a truck. The passengers were taken to a local hospital, where 55-year-old Sultan Sheikh was declared dead. The driver was arrested. Binu Gayen, 60, was run over by a state bus at Bhojerhat, near the Bantala leather complex. He was declared dead at National Medical College and Hospital. The driver has been arrested.     Around 100 taxi drivers chased motor vehicle inspectors at Bhagwandas Vehicle Testing Services on the Salt Lake stadium premises on Tuesday afternoon after a misunderstanding over calculation of waiting time during meter testing. Police brought the situation under control. The taxi drivers alleged that their vehicles were damaged during the test.    A 24-year-old youth carrying a single-shot was arrested in Pilkhana, Howrah, on Monday night. Mohammed Tyyab, who lives in the Golabari police station area, was produced in the CJMs court in Howrah on Tuesday and remanded in police custody for three days.    Around 80 parents and students of St Teresas School blocked Diamond Harbour Road, near Ekbalpore, for an hour on Tuesday morning to protest a hike in fees. The blockade was lifted after police intervened.    Pamela Ghosh, 60, was arrested in her Meher Ali Road house in Beniapukur on Tuesday for illegal possession of leopard skins and heads of bisons and chinkaras. Ghosh claimed the items belonged to her husband. Forest department officials said she had not declared the items.    A mob ransacked a nursing home at Bankra in Howrah on Tuesday morning alleging negligence after a 20-year-old woman died following a Caesarean section on Monday. Yasmin Begum, whose child is alive, was shifted to Medical College and Hospital after her condition deteriorated. She died at the hospital on Tuesday morning.    A 45-year-old man was found lying outside a liquor shop in Watgunge on Tuesday. He was declared dead at SSKM Hospital.

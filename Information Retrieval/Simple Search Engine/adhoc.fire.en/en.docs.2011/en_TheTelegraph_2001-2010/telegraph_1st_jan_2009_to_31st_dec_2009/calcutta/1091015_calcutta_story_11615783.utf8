The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hitch-free submission of forms on last day
                                                                                                               Hitch-free submission of forms on last day
          A STAFF REPORTER                           A candidate fills his application form outside the public service commissions office on Wednesday. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	Proper planning and a strong police presence ensured smooth submission of forms for Group D posts at the West Bengal Public Service Commission office on Wednesday, unlike the day before when there was chaos.         
	While those who thronged the SP Mukherjee address on Tuesday had to wait for several hours in the queue to submit their forms, as reported by The Telegraph, Tanmoy Banerjee was done and dusted in 10 minutes on Wednesday.         
	I had read in the newspaper that things were very chaotic here yesterday and there was even a mild lathicharge. But I was pleasantly surprised to see separate queues for men and women, many counters to submit forms and numerous cops on vigil, said Tanmoy, an MSc in chemistry who would gladly accept a peons job.         
	The PSC authorities admitted that the presence of cops made the difference on Wednesday, the last date of submission of forms for 4,013 posts of peon, orderly peon, night guard and durwan. According to them, over 10 lakh applications had been submitted for the posts.        
	PSC officials said the sea of job-seekers had stumped them the day before. We were not prepared for the large turnout because this is the first time Group D posts are being filled through the public service commission, said a senior official on Wednesday.         
	The PSC had not informed the police in advance, leading to chaos on Tuesday. By the time reinforcements were called in, all hell had broken loose, leading the cops to wield the baton on the swelling crowd.         
	Wiser with experience, the cops took every precaution Wednesday. Around 20 cops led by an assistant commissioner and the officer-in-charge of Tollygunge police station were deployed on the PSC campus. An ambulance was kept ready.         
	Todays turnout matches that of Tuesdays but with so many policemen around, no one is trying to jump the queue, smiled little Akhtar Ali on Wednesday, who was charging the candidates Rs 2 each to stitch their forms and other documents together.

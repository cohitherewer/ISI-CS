The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Row over police plot 
                                                                                                               Row over police plot 
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The superintendent of South 24-Parganas police will have to appear before the high court with documents on the legal status of the plot on which East Jadavpur police station has come up.        
	Justice Sanjib Banerjee ordered the district police chief, L.N. Meena, to table the papers on September 11 following a petition by seven individuals who claimed themselves to be the owners of the three-bigha plot on which the model police station had been built.        
	The plot has been in the custody of a receiver since 1958 when some owners of a large tract of land, of which the three-bigha plot is a part, moved Alipore court over a dispute among themselves, Bholanath Sapui and the six other petitioners have submitted before the high court. The original case is still pending in the Alipore court.        
	The seven petitioners have also alleged that the affidavit which the government had submitted to the Alipore court contained no evidence to prove that the three-bigha plot was owned by the state.        
	The 1958 case was related to 2,500 bighas in Mukundapur. In course of the proceedings, the government vested a part of the property while the court appointed a receiver to look after the rest.        
	The receiver later sold some parts of the land illegally. But the three-bigha plot on which the police station has come up was neither vested nor sold by the receiver. It belongs to us but the government unilaterally decided to construct the police station on it, the petitioners claimed.        
	The petitioners lawyer pleaded with the judge to ask the government to produce legal documents on the ownership of the plot. The state lawyer, however, denied any irregularity in the construction of the police station.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cop crunch in suburbs
                                                                                                               Cop crunch in suburbs
          SUBHAJOY ROY      
	Rash driving leading to fatal mishaps, such as the one on Bankim Setu in Howrah on July 4, cannot be prevented unless the strength of the traffic police is boosted.        
	Of the 2,800 sanctioned posts of traffic cops in all 18 districts of the state, half have been lying vacant. Some districts, such as Bankura, have only 15 sanctioned posts of traffic cops.        
	Even the sanctioned strength is far below our actual requirement of around 20,000 personnel. With this strength we cant enforce discipline on the road, said a senior officer of the state traffic police.        
	Most districts do not even have a deputy superintendent of police in charge of traffic.        
	Whats the situation like in the three neighbouring districts of Calcutta?        
	There are around 1,000 vacancies in Howrah, North and South 24-Parganas. A year before, the government had raised the strength of the state traffic police from 2,100 to 2,800. All but five of the extra posts were for these three districts. But they have never been filled up, said a source in the traffic wing of the state police.        
	While Howrah got 138 more posts, North and South 24-Parganas were allotted 306 and 251 posts, respectively.        
	A senior officer of North 24-Parganas police said: Against the revised strength of 560 traffic cops in the district, we have only 270. South 24-Parganas has 190 traffic cops against the sanctioned strength of 510 and Howrah, 150 cops against 592.        
	In September last year, the state police had sent a proposal to the home department seeking consent for recruitment of traffic volunteers, like the green cops in Calcutta.        
	The department is yet to reply to the proposal. We later came to know that senior officials in the department did not like the idea, said a source in the state police.        
	Calcutta has 500 green cops whose salaries are paid by the civic authorities.        
	They are of great help in managing vehicular and pedestrian traffic, said Ranvir Kumar, the joint commissioner of police (traffic).        
	D.P. Tarenia, the inspector-general (traffic), said the force had been hamstrung by the large number of vacancies. We are short of manpower. Compared with the strength of Calcutta police, we dont seem to exist, said Tarenia.        
	Against the sanctioned strength of 2,800 in 18 districts, Calcutta police has 3,263 personnel in its traffic wing.        
	When contacted over the phone, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said: We will try and fill up the vacant 1,400 posts by the end of this year. He, however, could not say why the proposal for enrolling traffic volunteers had been stalled.

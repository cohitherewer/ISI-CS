The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Time to walk freedom talk
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Time to walk freedom talk
  - Will Presidency be Alimuddin Street unbound?          OUR BUREAU                          WINDS OF CHANGE: Presidency College students in celebration mode on Wednesday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                        
	The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government, poised to grant unitary university status to Presidency College, could be eyeing an alternative model of autonomy in order to grant the institution real and not illusory freedom.        
	The two other unitary universities in town, Jadavpur University and Bengal Engineering and Science University, bear the autonomy tag but remain in Alimuddin Streets clutches when it comes to crucial academic, administrative and financial matters.        
	That, sources said, is a road Team Bhattacharjee does not want to take. The government may be looking at established international models in order to ensure the resurgence of Presidency College as an unshackled centre of excellence, said an official.        
	If the chief minister manages to walk this full-freedom-to-Presidency talk, he will be signalling a dramatic departure from the party line of control over leading educational institutions.        
	Case in point: JU and Besu. While JU is governed under the Jadavpur University Act 1981 (the Act was framed in 1955 and later amended), the Shibpur institute is run by the Bengal Engineering and Science University Act 2004. So, on paper, these two institutes are autonomous and should enjoy academic and administrative freedom.        
	But in reality, there is hardly any freedom for us when it comes to key decisions. The party (CPM) has the final say on any recruitment, from durwan to vice-chancellor, said a senior teacher in the engineering faculty of JU.        
	Financial freedom is a no-no for the two institutes, as they are state-aided unitary universities  which dont have affiliating colleges  and grants from the state government form a major part of their earnings.        
	Though there is nothing overtly wrong with the acts, the smart use of some of the provisions holds the key to control. The late Anil Biswas had perfected the art of using the acts to retain control over academic institutions, said a faculty member in Besu.        
	The Biswas line is typified by the inclusion of party loyalists as registered graduate representatives in the highest decision-making bodies of academic institutions.        
	On the face of it there is nothing wrong in involving graduates of the institute in the decision-making process. But in most universities only CPM sympathisers apply for these nominations, get inducted and then toe the party line in all key decisions, said a JU professor.         
	Out of the 60 members of the JU court  one of the highest policy-making bodies on campus  10 are registered graduate representatives and it is common knowledge that they are CPM nominees. The process of inducting graduate representatives is still on at Besu, which was granted university status in 2004.        
	If similar provisions find a place in the Presidency University bill that the government is scheduled to table in the Assembly this winter session, freedom from the clutches of the government  and the party  would remain a mirage for the 192-year-old institution.        
	That is where hopes are pinned on Bhattacharjees proposed move not to repeat the mistakes made with JU and Besu.        
	Once converted, Presidency College would require at least 100 fresh appointments in key posts such as vice-chancellor, registrar, deputy registrars, controller of examinations, professors and readers. The upgrade will lose relevance if such key appointments are controlled by Alimuddin Street, said a Presidency teacher.        
	Elaborating on how the partys candidates are drafted into key positions on campus, he referred to the selection process of vice-chancellors in CU and JU. First, the university court or the senate (in the case of CU) draws up a panel of three candidates from whom one is selected as the vice-chancellor after the final ratification by the chancellor.        
	The decision-making process while drawing up the panel is heavily politicised, said the Presidency teacher. Worthy candidates are often ignored to induct party functionaries in key positions.        
	For Presidency not to fall into that trap, the government will have to start a new chapter rather than just turning the page.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Caution in other colleges
                                                                                                               Caution in other colleges
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Colleges that were granted autonomy recently and those awaiting word from Calcutta University have started working out strategies to avert a postgraduate admission controversy like the one involving St Xaviers.         
	Ramakrishna Mission Residential College in Narendrapur wont be producing its first post-autonomy batch of graduates until 2012 but is already taking necessary steps to ease the admission heartburn.        
	We got autonomy only this year but need to act straightaway to ensure that our students dont face problems after passing out of our institution in 2012, said Swami Suparnanada, the principal of the college.        
	The college intends petitioning the authorities to consider graduates from autonomous colleges on a par with those from its affiliates.         
	Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandir in Belur, Scottish Church, Bethune and Loreto have kept their autonomy plans on hold till the university adopts a clear-cut policy on admitting students graduating from autonomous colleges.        
	The general feeling is that all admissions should be on the basis of entrance tests.         
	 Colleges are granted autonomy on the basis of the recommendations of the University Grants Commission. There is no reason why Calcutta University should not treat graduates from autonomous colleges on a par with those from its affiliates, said a principal of one of the colleges.

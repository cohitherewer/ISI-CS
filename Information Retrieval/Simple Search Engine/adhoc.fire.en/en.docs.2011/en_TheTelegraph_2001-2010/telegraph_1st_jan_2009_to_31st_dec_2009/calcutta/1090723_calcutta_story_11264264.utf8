                      Tagores vision through the eyes of children                    A cultural initiative by Happenings, its annual Rabindra Utsav celebrates the creativity and universal humanism of Rabindranath Tagore and, at the same time, encourages modern interpretations, experiments and explorations of his work. Over the last three years, this unique festival has grown to include performances of theatre, dance and music by groups from across the country, performing in their own languages and styles. Besides spreading the thoughts and philosophy of Tagore to different parts of the country and beyond, the festival also aims to encourage interest in Tagore among the younger generation. Through a rediscovery of Tagore, it tries to emphasise his relevance in our lives even today. As part of this programme, Happenings has added a new component to this years festival, taking Tagore to schools with a childrens theatre festival. Twelve schools, representing diverse languages, backgrounds and cultures, are participating at the ongoing festival; 10 of them will be presenting totally new productions based on Tagores work (poetry, prose or plays), in a language, style and interpretation of their choice. There will be a panel of judges to review the productions. The best two would be presented at the main festival to be held early next month. Tagore had a unique and holistic vision of child development, which was far ahead of his times. This childrens theatre festival presents a wonderful opportunity for youngsters to engage with the ideas and creativity of Tagore, through a process that he championed: of learning through the arts.

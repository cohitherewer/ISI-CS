The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Swine flu scare trims menu at food stops
                                                                                                               Swine flu scare trims menu at food stops
        A STAFF REPORTER                          Items such as pork chops (picture above) have disappeared from the menu of city restaurants and clubs                                        
	The next time you order sushi at a star hotel, be prepared to be served the vegetarian version. For when it comes to the swine flu effect, the menu motto of Calcutta eateries is better safe than sorry.        
	With the H1N1 flu spreading its wings, many city hotels, clubs and restaurants have struck pork and semi-raw meat dishes off their menus and stalled imports from certain North American countries.        
	All cold and semi-raw meat dishes have been taken off the buffet menu, so that they are at no point in direct contact with guests. Vegetarian sushi and sashimi have replaced the usual sushi, sashimi and smoked salmon. We also make sure that all raw vegetables and meat products go through sanitisation and immunisation in 100PPM (particles per molecule) chlorine solution, reveals Ramesh Javvaji, the executive chef of ITC, The Sonar.        
	At Taj Bengal and The Park, the buffet spread is where the pork has gone missing, though the a la carte menus are still offering well-done pork dishes as well as processed items like sausages and salamis.        
	As a precaution and in response to guest sensitivities, all Taj hotels have been instructed to remove pork products such as chops and spare ribs from buffet displays.        
	But we have been reassured by the guidance from the World Health Organisation that across the world, properly handled and prepared pork products can be consumed, said a spokesperson.        
	The Park does not serve imported pork and sources it from certified suppliers with the necessary approvals from the government of India and health authorities.        
	Both the food supplier and the foodie in the city are playing it safe.        
	I love pork but just like we stopped eating chicken and eggs because of bird flu, it seems prudent to go off pork till the swine flu storm blows over, said Pallavi Sen, a young professional.        
	The swine flu scare has spread from star hotels to some social clubs.        
	While you can still lay your hands on the Chilli Pork at Dalhousie Institute (they wont stop serving till they get a directive from the government) and Saturday Club, all pork options have flown off the popular Friday lunch and Saturday dinner continental buffet at Bengal Club.        
	We stopped serving pork because of swine flu a week ago. We are sticking to chicken and mutton, said Ashim Ghosh of Bengal Club.        
	Not many seem to mind the menu decision to err on the side of caution.        
	Food issues are very sensitive. We have discontinued all pork products last week and we have noticed that people have become so health-conscious that no one is missing pork, said Ashim Mewar of Red Hot Chilli Pepper.

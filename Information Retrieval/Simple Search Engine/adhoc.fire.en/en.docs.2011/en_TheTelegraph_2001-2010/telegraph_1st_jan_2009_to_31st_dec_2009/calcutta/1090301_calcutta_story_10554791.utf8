The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Quick fix for flowing hair
                                                                                                               Quick fix for flowing hair

	Utpal Dutts Bhavani Shankar in the 1979 laugh-riot Golmaal would have felt at home at Jadubabur Bazar in Bhowanipore.         
	Apart from being the biggest market in south Calcutta before the Gariahat market took the crown, Jadubabur Bazar has a curious claim to fame. It is a one-stop destination for mens hair care.         
	Quite understandably, almost all Sikhs in the city throng the market for grooming products for beards and moustaches. Walk into any Sardarji shop in Jadubabur Bazar and ask for a fixer  wax that keeps facial hair in place  and you can choose from a range of Hair Fixers, prettily packaged in pink, red, blue and yellow bottles.         
	The bottles come in a variety of sizes. A 100gm bottle costs Rs 40 and the biggest bottle is 500gm, worth Rs 160. There are options. Apart from regular, there are fixers with aloe vera and almond oil extracts.         
	The moustache-fixer comes in a small tube and for Rs 10, promises any desired position. Keeping up with the Set Wet Zatak generation, the fixer people have introduced fixer gel in a cool blue pot, guaranteeing extra hold.        
	The biggest and possibly the first shop to stock fixers in the city is Singh Stores. My father started selling hair fixers some 55 years ago, says Jasbinder Singh, eagerly displaying the entire range of products.         
	These days, fixers are available in Burrabazar too, but that is mostly for wholesale. Individual customers come to us, he adds.         
	There may be some other shops across the city that stock fixers, but only we are famous, says another shopkeeper, Narender Singh.        
	The fixers are not locally made; they are imported from Delhi, say the shopkeepers. Over the years, Singh Stores has started supplying fixers to other Sardarji stores in Jadubabur Bazar. We distribute stuff worth Rs 30,000 a month and sell fixers worth Rs 10,000 at the store.         
	Outside the main market, Charanjit Singh sits in his tiny shop and tells the tale of how fixers from his shop make their way to foreign shores. Salt Lake? Arre, hamare dukaan ka fixer Canada tak jata hai, he remarks when asked if his customers come from all corners of the city.         
	Maybe its time the Bengali aantel skipped his Nandan visit once a month and dropped in at Jadubabur Bazar. We can do nothing about the dirty jhola, but there seems to be a way to rein in the dirty flowing beard!       SAMHITA L.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Film school chargesheet
                                                                                                               Film school chargesheet
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI) has served chargesheets to six suspended students for defacing the institute property, gross misconduct with the authorities and trespassing.         
	The EM Bypass film school has remained shut since April 2 when a section of students gheraoed four senior officials, demanding their resignation. Six of the students were asked to leave the hostel premises following the fracas.        
	The six students will have to respond within 10 days. If they admit to the charges, we will take a call on the course of action. Some kind of punitive action will definitely be taken. But if they dont, an enquiry officer, independent of SRFTI, will be appointed to probe the matter. He will submit his findings to the institute chairman within a month, who will then present it to the governing council. The school will not reopen till the six students have vacated the hostel premises, institute director Swapan Mullick said on Thursday.

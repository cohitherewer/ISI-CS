                                                                                                               Terror catch in ticket queue
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Shahbaz Ismail in Lalbazar. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	An alleged Pakistani ex-jawan-turned-terrorist said to have sneaked into the city through Bangladesh for a secret mission in Jammu and Kashmir was arrested at Fairlie Place on Thursday afternoon.        
	Shahbaz Ismail, police said, is a member of Al Badar, a terror outfit based in Pakistan and backed by the al Qaida. The 27-year-old, police added, was a former jawan of a Pakistani paramilitary force. He had crossed the Bangladesh border near Murshidabad on Wednesday.        
	He was arrested while waiting in a queue for booking a ticket to Jammu at the Fairlie Place railway reservation office.        
	Police were acting on a tip-off from the Border Security Force. They might have come to know when Ismail crossed the border. We found out that he would go to Fairlie Place to buy a rail ticket, said an officer.        
	A team of officers was posted at the reservation office with Ismails photograph. The cops noticed him standing in queue in front of counter No. 20 and detained him. A cellphone with a Bangladeshi SIM card was found in the leather bag he was carrying.        
	Ismail was sent to India by the terror outfit on a secret mission. We are yet to find out the details of the operation, said Rajeev Kumar, the special inspector-general of the Special Task Force (STF).        
	Ismail told interrogators that he was born in Dera Ghazi and joined Pakistan Rangers (batch No. R39409), a paramilitary force, in 2004. After a year of training, he was posted in Sialkot. He served the force till last year, added Kumar.        
	Ismail said in his statement that he flew from Karachi to Dhaka on a Pakistani passport and waited there a few days for instructions from his team leader. He was then asked to enter India.        
	According to the Intelligence Bureau, over 80 per cent of the Al Badar recruits used to work for the Pakistan army and paramilitary forces. The outfit wants to build up a troop with youths trained by the armed forces, said an officer.

	A teenaged domestic help hit his 55-year-old landlady on the head, tied her up and gagged her before robbing cash and jewellery worth Rs 20,000.        
	Police said Meenadevi Lohia was alone in the first-floor Sovabazar flat on Wednesday afternoon when Ramesh Das, appointed just four days ago, attacked her.        
	When one of her sons returned around three hours later, he found Meenadevi lying in the bathroom, bleeding from wounds on the head.        
	Ramesh hit the woman with a wooden bar as soon as she emerged from the bathroom, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police, detective department.        
	He then gagged her, tied her hands and legs and locked her in the bathroom before taking away the valuables from an almirah, added Shamim.        
	Meenadevis husband Kailash Lohia and their eldest son are in Jammu. The couples other two sons were in their welding shop on NS Road.        
	Ramesh, a resident of Orissa was brought to the Lohias by another domestic help in the neighbourhood.              
	Student with gun        
	An 18-year-old boy loitering around the Titagarh ferryghat was arrested on Wednesday afternoon after a revolver and five bullets were found in his schoolbag. Two days ago, a 14-year-old boy had attacked his grandparents and aunt with a chopper bought by saving his school fees.        
	Police said Mohammed Imam, a Class XI student of a Barrackpore school, had a fight with some of his friends and was plotting revenge.        
	The cops were probing how the Titagarh resident, whose father is a garments trader, procured the gun and the bullets. We became suspicious on seeing the boy in school uniform loitering around and alerted the police, said Mani Ram, who runs a paan shop.              
	Dacoits held        
	A dacoity attempt in Mahestala, on the southern fringes of the city, was foiled early on Wednesday with the arrest of eight youths. A search is on for four others who escaped. Following a tip-off, cops surrounded a foundry in Mollargate which the 12 had planned to rob. The gang had arrived by a Matador.              
	False alarm        
	Two days after a Baguiati bank was looted, a security alarm went off accidentally at the East Sinthee branch of a cooperative bank on Wednesday morning. Police rushed to the bank only to realise that it was a false alarm.

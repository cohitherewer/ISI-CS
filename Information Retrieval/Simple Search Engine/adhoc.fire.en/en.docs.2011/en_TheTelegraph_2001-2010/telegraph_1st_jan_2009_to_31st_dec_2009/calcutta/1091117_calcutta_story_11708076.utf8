The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Taxi drivers hit by replacement delay 
                                                                            Tuesday , November 17 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Taxi drivers hit by replacement delay 
          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                          The wait for new taxis could stretch to next year                                   
	Sreeram Mishra has been working overtime for over three months now without making enough to make ends meet. Till July 31, the 40-year-old drove his own taxi and earned about Rs 600 a day after meeting the fuel and maintenance costs. Today he is one of the thousands waiting for a new taxi after their old vehicles went off the road following the high court ban.         
	The Liluah resident has been driving a hired taxi but his daily income of Rs 200 is not enough to provide for his family of five and pay the equated monthly installment (EMI) for the new taxi, which might not be delivered before next year.        
	Mishra had applied for a new taxi on August 25 after getting a loan of Rs 3,22,500 from a nationalised bank. I now have to pay an EMI of Rs 7,100 after sustaining my family on a third of my usual income. If this goes on for another month, we wont get to eat, he told Metro.        
	More than three months after the ban came into effect, barely 2,000 new taxis have been supplied to the 5,200-odd applicants. Hindustan Motors, which manufactures Ambassadors, has been supplying about 600 vehicles a month.         
	At this rate, replacing the remaining 4,300-odd banned taxis will take another eight months. How will the operators survive that long? asked Tarak Nath Bari, the secretary of the Calcutta Taxi Association.         
	According to transport department sources, the problem arose out of operators reluctance to apply for replacement on time. Cabbies did not bother to apply for new vehicles despite knowing since July 18 last year that their old vehicles would be banned, said an official.        
	A four-month reprieve in the form of an extension of the high court deadline from March 31 to July 31 did not improve matters. Till the first week of August, they were busy moving the Supreme Court on the issue, hoping for a miracle, added the official.         
	Hindustan Motors too blamed the operators. Till August-end, no application reached us. Suddenly, from September, thousands started applying. We couldnt have possibly replaced 5,000 taxis in a month. The so-called delay is not of our making, said Murari Chowdhury, the executive vice-president of the company.        
	Operators arent willing to buy the argument. Even Hindustan Motors knew since July 18 last year that this was going to happen. Instead of waiting for applications, why did they not gear up to meet the demand? asked Tapan Nandy, a former taxi owner from Haridevpur, who has been waiting since early September for a new taxi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Students write to filmmakers 
                                                                                                               Students write to filmmakers 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Students of the troubled Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute met chairman Buddhadeb Dasgupta for the second time on Wednesday afternoon.        
	Dasgupta told the students that many members of the film schools governing council, which includes filmmaker Jahnu Barua and theatre and film director Jabbar Patel, might not be able to make it to Calcutta by April 16 for the proposed meeting. Barua and Patel are based in Mumbai.        
	The chairman suggested we got in touch with the council members. We have written to Barua and Patel, requesting them to come to Calcutta, said a member of the students body.        
	The students also decided to call up the filmmakers later in the evening and request them to come to Calcutta soon to help resolve the issues.        
	Dasgupta also suggested the students speak to the council members before the formal meeting and discuss their problems and demands.         
	The filmmakers are busy between April 17 and 24. We will request them to come to Calcutta before they get busy with their schedules, said a student.        
	The council members have insisted that the April 16 meeting be held outside the SRFTI campus but the students want it to be held on the premises.        
	Weve been told the council members, especially those from the ministry, are apprehensive about coming to the campus as they fear they might be attacked by students. Are we hooligans that wed trap anyone without rhyme or reason? retorted a student body member, adding the students had already held two peaceful meetings with the chairman.         
	SRFTI is likely to remain closed till the council meets. We want our classes to resume as soon as possible. Our projects are due and a lot of activities are stalled, including the diploma films to be made by final year students. The greatest loss (because of the impasse) is ours, rued a student.

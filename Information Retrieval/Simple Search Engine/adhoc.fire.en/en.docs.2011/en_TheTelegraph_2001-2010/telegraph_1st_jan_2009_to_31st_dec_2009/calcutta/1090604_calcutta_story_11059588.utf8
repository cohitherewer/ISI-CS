The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Move to ease airport road chaos
                                                                                                               Move to ease airport road chaos
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The airport authorities and airline officials have suggested measures to police to ease the congestion on VIP Road, with people regularly missing flights because of snarls.        
	The measures were discussed at a meeting of the Airports Authority of India (AAI), Airlines Operators Committee, CISF and North 24-Parganas police on Wednesday. A number of suggestions came up at our meet to relieve passengers of the traffic problem, said V.K. Monga, the director of Calcutta airport.         
	One of the suggestions was to bar vehicles coming out of the airport from taking a right turn on VIP Road towards Jessore Road. The vehicles can take a U-turn at the Kaikhali crossing, around 1km from the airport entrance gate No. 1, said an airport official who attended the meeting.         
	Some channels were created near the airport to ease traffic movement but these were of no help, said an airline official who also attended the meeting.         
	It was thus suggested that the airport gate on Jessore Road which is now closed be opened for traffic from Barasat towards Ultadanga between 7am and 11am. These vehicles will then take the road inside the airport and exit through gate No. 1. From 5pm to 10pm, the diversion will be in the opposite direction.         
	Between 6pm and 8pm a number of flights are delayed because of late reporting by fliers, said an airline official.

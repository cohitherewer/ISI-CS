The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Power dips, heat peaks
                                                                                                               Power dips, heat peaks
  - Relief a far cry as demand outstrips generation          OUR BUREAU                                            
	A demand-supply mismatch has plunged the city and its neighbouring districts into prolonged periods of power-cuts that officials fear will continue for the next few days.        
	To add to the residents woes, the city is in the grip of a Celsius surge that shows no sign of abating in the next couple of days as the conditions are not conducive for a Norwester.        
	Power department officials said the demand had increased over the past few days but the generation by the state-owned power plants and the National Thermal Power Corporations (NTPC) plant in Farakka has dropped, resulting in frequent power cuts across the city and the districts.        
	Yesterday, the combined shortfall in the city and the districts was 385 MW. Tomorrow, it may be around 400. The state-owned plants are not generating to their capacity and the Central plants, which supplied between 700 and 800 MW to the state grid till Thursday, have halved their supply, a power department official said on Sunday.        
	Officials in the department blamed the poor generation in the state units of Kolaghat, Bakreswar, Sagardighi and other places on the poor quality of coal.        
	In the Sagardighi plant, there was the additional problem of a drop in coal supply. We need three rakes of coal (10,500 tonnes) for the Sagardighi plant daily but are getting only two rakes (7,000 tonnes). So, the plant is producing 400-450 MW against the optimum capacity of 600 MW, said S. Mahapatra, the managing director of Power Development Corporation Limited.        
	NTPC officials said two units in the Farakka plant have been shut as the level of water in the feeder canal of the Hooghly has gone down.        
	With the city feeling the heat, the Alipore Met office attributed the present spell to dry hot air blowing in from the west. That has led to the discomfort though there has not been any appreciable rise in the maximum temperature. The situation is not conducive yet for a Norwester, a Met official said.        
	We are suffering regular power cuts over the past two weeks, the duration varying from 30 minutes to two hours, said Riya Chakraborty, a resident of Kasba Bosepukur.        
	Last week, every single evening was dark for around an hour or two. My three-month-old nephew has developed rashes all over his body because of the excessive heat, said Abhinaba Majumder, a resident of Behala Chanditala.

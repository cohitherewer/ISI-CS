The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Brit players for film on barefoot triumph
                                                                                                               Brit players for film on barefoot triumph
          KUSHALI NAG                                                  
	Seven British footballers, who play for clubs like Harrow, Middleton and Middlesex, are flying down to Calcutta for a face-off with Mohun Bagan.        
	No, Ashley Bailey, Joseph Bennett, Davey Lee Mitchell, Simon Cristol, Christopher Robert Kelly, Patrick Boyle and Andrew Comber will not take on Bhaichung Bhutias men, but the one that beat East Yorkshire Regiment 2-1 in the IFA Shield final in 1911.        
	Mohan Bagans historic football triumph is the subject of the Bengali film Suchona, to be steered by first-time director Arun Roy.        
	To lend authenticity to the nail-biting match, the makers of Suchona have signed British footballers to show off their ball skills.        
	I didnt want foreign tourists to pose as footballers. I wanted to keep it real and thats why we have hired players from the UK. The best part is that the footballers have agreed to do the film for free. We are only taking care of their food and stay. Their only demand is to catch a Mohun Bagan match, said Roy.        
	The UK wing of city-based PR agency Candid Communications has inked the deal.        
	The Mohun Bagan team in the film, however, wont have any professional footballer; it will star Chirodini Tumi Je Aamar hero Rahul.        
	In real life, skipper Shibdas Bhaduri had led a team of barefoot players to victory against a series of booted and brawny English clubs to lift the shield. The victory is said to have inspired the Indian freedom struggle.         
	The action replay of Mohun Bagans victory will be shot March 23 onwards on a set in Chagulia village in Kalyani.        
	We will shoot the match sequence with three cameras. We will get 50 bullock carts as back in 1911 people travelled in bullock carts. The seats would be made of bamboo, as there was no gallery then. A few tents will be put up for the British players, like in those days. We also need a huge crowd. So, we have asked the local people to drop by to catch the shooting, added Roy.         
	Co-produced by Alok Roy, Rahul and Arijit Dutta of Piyali Films, Suchona has a Rs 1 crore budget.        
	I agreed to do the project as I liked the script. The ending is superb and football is very close to the hearts of Bengalis. The expenses will not mount as none of the British footballers play in the Premier League, said Dutta, whose Piyali Films is producing a film 30 years after Tapan Sinhas Hatey Bajare and Arundhati Devis Chhuti.

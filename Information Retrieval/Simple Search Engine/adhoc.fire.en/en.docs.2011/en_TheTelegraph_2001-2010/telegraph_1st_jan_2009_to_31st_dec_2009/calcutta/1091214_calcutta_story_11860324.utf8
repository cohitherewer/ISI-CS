The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | KKR boss   keeps captain waiting
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      KKR boss   keeps captain waiting
  - Shah Rukh and Souravs friendship show           PRATIM D. GUPTA                          Shah Rukh Khan and Sourav Ganguly on the Dadagiri Unlimited stage on Sunday. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                              
	Shah Rukh Khan did to Sourav Ganguly on Sunday evening what Sourav Ganguly had done eight winters ago to Steve Waugh.        
	If the Team India skipper had kept his Australian rival waiting for five minutes at the toss at Eden Gardens, the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) boss kept his captain waiting for five hours on the quizmasters pitch at the Mohun Bagan ground.        
	The occasion? The grand finale of Dadagiri Unlimited, the show on Zee Bangla hosted by Sourav. The special guest? Shah Rukh Khan.        
	Our special guest is mid-air, Sourav had told the 10,000-plus crowd in the galleries and on the ground. That was around 7.30pm.        
	Our special guest will be here shortly, said Sourav, to the crowd getting restive (and cold), around 9pm.        
	Finally, around 9.30pm, the man emerged in the galleries, dressed in a grey blazer, black T-shirt and trademark red-framed glasses.        
	Blaming his delay on the Calcutta fog, the showman then went about doing what he does best  playing to the galleries. Dada ko pakadna mushkil hi nahin namumkin hai, declared SRK the Don.        
	It is absolutely marvellous to be in Calcutta, but even more marvellous to be here with my friend, smiled Shah Rukh.        
	There was more to come from the KBC quizmaster for the Dadagiri quizmaster. I have always seen Dada playing cricket or discussing cricket, so its a pleasant surprise to see him in a new avatar. I was watching him from backstage and he is very good.        
	The Behala boy, almost bashful at the praise heaped on him by the Bollywood badshah, repaid the compliment by claiming to be Shah Rukhs biggest fan.        
	Sunday also saw a role reversal of sorts with SRK being the guest of honour on Souravs quiz show months after Sourav had played judge to SRKs cheerleader hunt Knights amp; Angels.        
	Shah Rukh was at the ground for barely an hour but he was in full form. He mouthed dialogues from his blockbusters, sang Kuch kuch hota hai and even danced to Om shanti om with Sourav and the Dadagiri finalists.        
	The crowning moments of the mutual admiration club? The two hugged (with no John Buchanan between them) and gifted each other paintings  Shah Rukh gave Sourav a Sourav and Sourav gave Shah Rukh a Shah Rukh.        
	What if this partnership wins KKR the cup? I will come and dance for all of you, dimpled SRK.

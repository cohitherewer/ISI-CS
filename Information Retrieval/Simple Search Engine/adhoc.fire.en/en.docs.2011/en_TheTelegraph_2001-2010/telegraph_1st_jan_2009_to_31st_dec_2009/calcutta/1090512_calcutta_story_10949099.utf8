                                                                                                               Protest, gherao over fee hike
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Guardians of students of Nava Nalanda High School took to the streets for the second time in two weeks to protest a hike in fees.        
	Around 30 staff members, including rector Arijit Mitra, were not allowed by the guardians to leave the school compound for several hours. They were escorted out by police around 8.30pm.        
	Earlier, over 100 guardians demonstrated against the hike outside the main branch of the school on Southern Avenue, holding up traffic.         
	Guardians put up partial roadblocks for around 40 minutes from 9.25am outside the primary section of the school near Lords Bakery on Prince Anwar Shah Road and for 45 minutes from 1.45pm in front of the schools Gobindapur branch.         
	The roadblocks were removed after police intervened.        
	According to the school authorities, some teachers of the primary section were assaulted by the protesters.        
	The guardians demanded that the school roll back the 40 per cent increase in tuition fees and also protested against the hike in development fees from Rs 1,300 to Rs 2,200.        
	The school authorities have offered to accept the development fee in two instalments.        
	Students have to walk through one classroom to get to another. They are crammed into benches and dont get adequate drinking water even though there are water purifiers, said a guardian.        
	We have been paying development fees for so many years but little has been done with the money. We will consider paying the increased fees if the facilities are improved, said another guardian.        
	We tried to negotiate with the parents but they were not happy with anything, said Mitra.        
	The school authorities will meet the guardians on May 15.

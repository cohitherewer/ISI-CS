  - t2 Speed Dating zooms off          A STAFF REPORTER                          DATE DOCTOR: Actress Parno Mitra at the screening of candidates                                        
	He is an IIT-IIM boy working as a business consultant and looking for a girl he can spend time with and go for movies and music gigs.        
	She is an HR professional working with a reputed MNC and looking for a guy to have fun with and beat the meltdown blues.        
	Both have made a beeline for t2 Speed Dating, along with hundreds of others, underlining how the lonely hearts club in Calcutta is growing fast.        
	There are no eligible bachelors in my work space. The ones who are eligible arent bachelors and the bachelors arent eligible, smiled one of the girls gunning for a five-minute date with 25 qualified people of the opposite sex.        
	For those in the slow lane, speed dating is an organised form of matchmaking that involves many couples meeting in a short period of time. The contest, open to single boys and girls between 22 and 32, kicked off on Valentines Day and drew doctors and engineers, IT professionals and teachers. The curtains come down with a Cupid round on Saturday evening at Spring Club, involving 25 men and 25 women shortlisted and screened over a fortnight.        
	Each couple will interact for five minutes without exchanging contact details. If they want to date again  the urge must be mutual and not one-sided  email IDs would be passed on to get them started.        
	Speed dating is a new concept in Calcutta. Its a comfortable option for people like us and the profile of the people is impressive, said Rita, 24, from Sector V.        
	So why is Calcuttas single professional so ready to mingle? This kind of a dating concept is an attractive form of exposure. Half the work is already done and like-minded people are sharing a common platform, says consultant psychologist Anuttama Banerjee. Also, getting to know the unknown is pleasurable and with 25 choices you can assess who is good for you!        
	Some have been lured by the Swayamvar factor, others by the promise of thrills after spills (read, failed affairs). Speed dating means smart dating for 27-year-old businessman Viraj, while it means something that even the parents are cool about for freelancing emcee Aditi.

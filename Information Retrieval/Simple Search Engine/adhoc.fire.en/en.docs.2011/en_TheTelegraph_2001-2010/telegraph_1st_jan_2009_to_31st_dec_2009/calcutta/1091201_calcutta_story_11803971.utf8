The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Doctor faces bandh brawn
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Doctor faces bandh brawn

	Mondays shutdown revealed its cruellest face on VIP Road, where a surgeon on an emergency call was heckled and his car damaged for daring to defy the bandh call.        
	Satyabrata Roy, an assistant professor in the gynaecology department of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, was rushing to operate on a critical patient on Monday morning when he encountered the bandh brigade, wielding BJP flags, iron rods and bamboo poles near the Kestopur crossing.         
	I knew from their body language that they wanted to stop me. I slammed the brakes, got off the car and showed them my identity card, Roy later told Metro.         
	The Baguiati resident said he told the 20-odd men that he was on his way to operate on a critical patient.         
	My juniors had called me at 5.30am and said the patient needed immediate surgery. I tried to reason with the bandh enforcers but they refused to listen, said Roy.         
	Suddenly, one of the men hit the bonnet of his car with a bamboo pole. Others rained blows on the car, smashing the windscreen and the rear glass pane, Roy said.         
	They shouted at me that they wanted to teach me a lesson for defying the bandh call. I felt utterly helpless, the doctor recalled.         
	The vandals relented after causing significant damage to Roys car and allowed him to leave. Though shaken, Roy headed for the hospital and performed the surgery. The patient was stable on Monday evening.         
	It is shocking that a doctor on emergency duty was treated so badly, said one of Roys colleagues. Roy later lodged a police complaint. A mechanic said the car repairs would cost at least Rs 15,000.         
	The violence continued on several stretches of VIP Road till 8.30am. A private bus on the L238 route was set on fire at Kestopur while heading towards Barasat from Howrah. At the Baguiati crossing, police resorted to a lathicharge to remove bandh enforcers squatting on VIP Road.

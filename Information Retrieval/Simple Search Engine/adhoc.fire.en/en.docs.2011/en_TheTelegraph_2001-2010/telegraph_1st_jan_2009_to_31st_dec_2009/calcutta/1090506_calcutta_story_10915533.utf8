The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Schools lack asthma care
                                                                                                               Schools lack asthma care
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The tragedy that befell Akriti Bhatia in Delhi may strike Calcutta any day, experts warned on World Asthma Day (May 5).        
	Almost one in every five people in the city suffers from asthma and the number of the affected doubles every 10 years.        
	Akriti, 17, suffered a severe asthma attack in her school on April 20 and died before she could be taken to hospital. Akritis parents accused the school of negligence but the authorities said the parents did not inform them of their daughters condition or send any medicine with her.        
	What happened to Akriti can happen to any student in the city, as most schools here are neither aware of the ailment nor equipped with the basic medical kit, said A.G. Ghosal, the director of the National Allergy Asthma Bronchitis Institute.        
	I know about a reputable school that had once asked a parent to take his ward to another school as he had been suffering from asthma. Another school flatly refused to host an awareness programme, Ghosal added. K.K. Ghosh, the president of the respiratory wing of the Indian Association of Paediatrics, agreed: Most schools are hardly aware of the complications that asthma can lead to and do not make any arrangement to tackle respiratory emergencies.        
	Ghosh pointed out that dust, chalk powder, moist environment, a fresh coat of paint and even a strong perfume can trigger asthma attack. When the school authorities find an inhaler cannot ease the respiratory distress, they should rush the student to hospital, he said. Most schools admit they are unaware of the number of asthmatic students but accuse parents of suppressing information from them.        
	Children often bring nebulisers to schools but the parents seldom inform us about their ailments, said Ballygunge Siksha Sadan principal Sunita Sen. Schools do have a responsibility but parents, too, should alert us about their childrens ailments, said Devi Kar, the principal of Modern High School for Girls.

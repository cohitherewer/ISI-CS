                                                                                                               Tragedy strikes family of three
  Nobody was wearing a helmet     Bike took U-turn when truck hit     Trio on two-wheeler unsafe, illegal
   No traffic cop on road till accident					 					      A STAFF REPORTER                       Accident victims Souvik and Monica Roy on their wedding day                                                           
	A young family of three riding a motorbike without helmets was torn asunder when a truck rammed into the two-wheeler, killing the parents and leaving their five-year-old son critically injured.         
	The accident occurred on a service road parallel to the Rajchandrapur toll plaza on NH-2 on Wednesday morning, barely 10 minutes after 33-year-old Souvik Roy set out of home along with wife Monica, 26, and son Emon.         
	The couple were to put Emon, a kindergarten student at Adamas International School in Belghoria, on the school bus that stops near the accident site and proceed to Monicas parents house.         
	Police quoted witnesses as saying that Souvik, an executive at Techno India in New Town, tried taking a U-turn to park the motorbike at the bus stop on the right but braked on seeing a truck racing down from the opposite side.         
	If not wearing a helmet was the first mistake, taking a U-turn in the middle of the road was the second error and stopping right there on seeing the truck was the third one. The truck driver also slammed the brakes but it was too late, an officer said.         
	Souvik and Emon were flung off the motorbike on impact while Monica was dragged along with the two-wheeler for several metres before being crushed between the truck and a heavy vehicle parked in front of a roadside dhaba.         
	The sound of brakes screeching and the clang of metal are still echoing in my ears. The woman died instantly but the man was alive when me and some other bystanders rushed towards him and the unconscious child. When we reached them, the man sat up and held his head in his hands, witness Narayan Das said.         
	Souvik and his son were taken to Uttarpara State General Hospital in Hooghly, where he died shortly after being admitted. A doctor said Souvik even made a couple of calls after reaching the hospital but died of suspected brain haemorrhage a little later.                   The motorbike involved in the mishap.

	Emon was referred to SSKM Hospital from there and later shifted to the Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences at Mukundapur. Till late on Wednesday night, he was in the intensive care unit of the EM Bypass hospital.         
	Monicas mother Aparna Acharya said her daughter, who worked as a nurse in a Barasat nursing home, had taken study leave for the day to prepare for her second-year BSc examination in nursing from Peerless Hospital.         
	Who could have thought that it would come to this? she cried.         
	Residents of the area where the tragedy occurred said more accidents were waiting to happen on the service road in the absence of traffic management during the morning and late afternoon rush hours. Commuters, including schoolchildren, wait for buses on either side of the road as vehicles race down from both sides. There is not a single traffic police post on the road, said a shopkeeper.         
	The lone constable doing duty at the site after the accident said there was little he could do given the volume of traffic on the road.         
	Bus and truck drivers are a law unto themselves and two-wheeler riders dont seem to care about their own safety. At least four traffic constables are required to manage such volume of traffic, he said.         
	The arrested driver of the truck involved in the accident told investigators that he tried his best to avert the collision. Our preliminary investigation suggests that Souvik might have survived had he worn a helmet, an officer of Bally police station said.         
	Two-wheeler riders not wearing helmets is a widespread malaise in the city and its suburbs. Another common sight is more than two people on a motorbike, which is illegal. The police rarely fine offenders.

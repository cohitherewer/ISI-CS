The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Conduct code for brokers
                                                                                                               Conduct code for brokers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Realtors in Calcutta have stressed the need for a code of conduct for property marketing agents to ensure transparency in their functioning and a better deal for the consumer.        
	The selling agents job doesnt end with concluding a deal. They should also provide accurate information to buyers to help them make an informed decision, Santosh Rungta, the national president of Credai, told members of the Realtors amp; Estate Consultants Association recently.        
	The city chapter of the property consultants hosted the first annual general meeting of the National Association of Realtors, where real estate developers stressed the need for clarity in information flow from brokers to buyers to improve the credibility of the realty trade.        
	Ensuring that the title of the property is clean, providing honest details on carpet area and features of the project and even warning a prospective buyer of chronic waterlogging in a neighbourhood  all this should fall within the ambit of their work, Rungta told Metro.        
	Credai Bengal president Pradeep Sureka agreed that there was a need to raise the level of commitment to the consumer. A code of conduct for property agents on the lines of the one we have for Credai members can bring in more discipline and commitment among them, he said.        
	Property consultants admitted there was a need to streamline real estate brokerage, improve access to skills, education and best practices and act as a common voice of the community.         
	But individual agents and small brokering enterprises do not invest in such training because this trade works on success fees and does not have a steady stream of income, pointed out organised property agents.         
	We try to do our bit by coordinating with lawyers and guard against illegal products, but its often tough to control quality at all levels, said Jitendra Khaitan of Pioneer Properties.        
	P.S.N. Rao, the chairman of the National Association of Realtors, said that to address this problem, the association was trying to provide meaningful real estate education to all members.

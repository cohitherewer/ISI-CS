	If you live in Calcutta, you have a relationship with the Howrah bridge. The 705 metre-long beauty may be a part of your daily commute or you may pass through it just once a year on your way to Howrah station for the annual holiday, but we Calcuttans will always be the Howrah bridge people.         
	On a recent trip to Thailand, I met another bridge people  the Kwai people. Kwai Yai is a river, but its a bridge across the river that defines the people and their lives in the little Thai town of Kanchanaburi, tucked away near the Myanmar (Burma) border. Like the current structure of Howrah bridge, built between 1937 and 1943 to facilitate military transportation between Calcutta and the industrial hub at Howrah during World War II, the bridge on Kwai is a World War II structure too.         
	The place was made famous by the 1957 British film The Bridge on the River Kwai. The largely fictional work is based on Japans construction of the notorious Burma-Siam railway in 1942-43, also called the Death Railway because of the loss of thousands of lives of British, Dutch, American and Australian prisoners of war (POW) and Asian workers, who fell to torture, malnutrition, overwork and disease. The railway line, 424km long, was completed in December 1943. The bridge was bombed by the Allied forces in April 1943. A portion of the bridge and the Death Train has been rebuilt and opened to tourists.         
	Kanchanaburi town is around 130 km from Bangkok and can be visited on a day trip. One can also stay overnight. After the customary bargaining with a pretty travel agent in sing-song English, we set off at 7am from Bangkok in a mini-van. As we glided along the smooth-as-Hema Malinis cheek road, shiny skyscrapers gave way to lush green hills, which appeared a mysterious blue from a distance. Two hours later, we reached Kanchanaburi and our first stop was the Kanchanaburi War Cemetery. It is an extremely well-maintained cemetery of the Allied POW who died during the construction of the railway.         
	Next we stopped at the Jeath War Museum (JEATH stands for the five main nationalities involved in the construction of the railway: Japan, England, Australia, Thailand and Holland). It contains a rich collection of World War II artefacts, displayed in life-size installations. Japanese POW camps have been recreated, complete with a railway wagon that served as a prison, each telling its tales of torture with chilling clarity. Portions of the railway track and a wooden bridge that was built before the steel structure came up are on display. The most moving display is the room where the bombing of the bridge is depicted. When the Japanese realised that bombing was imminent, they made the Allied POWs stand on the bridge in hordes and wave to their counterparts in fighter planes. Little did the POWs know that they were being used as a human shield and hundreds of lives were lost. A newspaper report in the museum said the waters of the Kwai had turned red after the bombing.         
	A solemn silence descended on our group as we trooped out of the museum, having come face-to-face with the cruelty of war and mans infinite capacity for hatred. A minutes walk away stands the beautiful bridge on the Kwai with its curved railings, destroyed by war and rebuilt to give a town its identity and biggest source of sustenance. One can walk down the bridge for a breathtaking view of the river and its surrounding hills. On one end stand thatched watchtowers used by Japanese officers to keep an eye on construction workers and POWs.         
	Next on our itinerary was a ride on the Death Train. We hopped onto our mini-van and some 30 minutes later, reached a quaint little station. Corn fields flanked both sides of the tracks and the place had a dreamy air about it. But souvenir and snacks shops did brisk business.         
	It was a modest train with wooden seats and wide windows and was delightfully clean, considering that it is still used by local residents for commuting too. The train wound its way through the hilly terrain, offering splendid views of the river with every twist and bend. At one spot, the train slowed to a crawl and our guide informed us that we were passing over a wooden portion that belongs to the original World War II track. Five stops later, we disembarked at another tiny station and headed for our mini-van. Thai schoolchildren on the train waved us goodbye.         
	Our ravenous lot was next driven to the riverfront, where a typical Thai lunch was served in a little floating restaurant on the Kwai river that swayed gently in the swift current. Some went bamboo rafting on the Kwai after lunch while others were taken to a nearby waterfall for a dip. Another attraction in the area is the Tiger Temple, where Buddhist monks have reared abandoned and orphaned tiger cubs by hand. Tourists are allowed to touch, cuddle and click pictures with the regal creatures.         
	Around 4pm, exhausted and exhilarated, we started for Bangkok. As I went through the pictures of the bridge on Kwai, my mind went back to our dear Howrah bridge, majestic and magnificent.

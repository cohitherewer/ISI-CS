The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fun-filled gym for kids
                                                                                                               Fun-filled gym for kids
                                  
	Hitting the treadmill has traditionally been a rite of passage to teenage and adulthood, but with the rise in childhood obesity, gyms in the city are offering training programmes tailored to kids needs.        
	Golds Gym on JL Nehru Road has introduced an anti-obesity wellness programme for children, while Solace, a gym at Sunny Park, has lined up special activities for kids and adolescents.         
	Obesity has assumed menacing proportions among schoolchildren in the upper-middle and high income groups. There has been a 20 per cent rise in childhood obesity in India in the last five years, said Apurba Ghosh, the director of the Institute of Child Health in Calcutta.         
	Obese children are susceptible to diabetes and pulmonary and orthopaedic disorders. They may suffer from hypo-ventilation in their sleep and depression, Ghosh added.        
	Those between eight and 16 years are the most susceptible, said Bijal Purohit, the instructor for the childrens programme at Golds Gym.         
	Schools are cutting down on physical education, dance and games lessons. Children dont even go out to play after school these days. While parents are at work, the kids settle down to watch TV or play computer games with comfort foods like burger, cola or wafers, says Anubha Tataria, a nutritionist at Golds Gym.         
	We have 15 kids between 14 and 16 years who are overweight and very conscious about their problem. We recommend a dietary plan that controls senseless eating and cuts out fast food, says Carolann Hooper, the manager of Solace.         
	Some parents are also seeking expert help. My daughter never lost her baby fat and that worried me. I have enrolled her at the gym, though I havent told her its an anti-obesity programme. She thinks she will exercise with me and doesnt mind it, says P. Mukherjee at Golds Gym.         
	Fitness experts point out that a child cannot take up the same workout as an adult. The gym has to be fun too. So while Golds Gym has aerobics and sports drill for kids, Solace has aqua aerobics.         
	Avoid exercises that may cause injury. The focus should be on mobility exercises, suggests strength and conditioning expert Ranadeep Moitra.

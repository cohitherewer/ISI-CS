          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Striking high court lawyers may resume work from Monday, sources said.        
	The high court bar association, on a 10-day ceasework since Tuesday primarily to press for filling up of the vacant posts of judges, has called an extraordinary general body meeting at 1pm on Friday to review the situation arising out of the strike.        
	Chances are the meeting will decide on ending the ceasework from Monday following an appeal from Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar, the sources said.        
	Our first demand was immediate recruitment to the 18 vacant posts of judges in the high court. We are also protesting the misbehaviour of a section of judges, association president Sardar Amjad Ali said on Thursday.        
	The chief justice, Ali added, had called the leaders of the bar association and two other lawyers organisations of the court  Bar Library Club and Incorporate Law Society  to his office on Wednesday.        
	The discussion was cordial. The chief justice wants the strike to end. He provided us with crucial information about the appointment of judges and also suggested how to tackle the judges who misbehave with lawyers, Ali said.        
	Asked whether the association will withdraw the strike, Ali said: The members will decide the course of action.... The lawyers themselves are suffering because of the strike... but a solution must be respectable.        
	While announcing the ceasework on October 30, the association leaders said they would review the situation on November 9.         
	But the review meeting has been called three days before schedule. Its significant, said a source, hinting at the possibility of an early end to the strike.

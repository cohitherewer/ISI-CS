                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Goodness as reflex action
          DOEL BOSE                          Author Shiv Khera at the launch of his latest series, Little Leaders and Young Leaders, at GD Birla Sabhagar on November 1. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray                                  
	Today, youngsters no longer feel remorse about making a mistake. The only objective is to avoid getting caught. It is no surprise that the average age of a criminal is much lower now, said Shiv Khera, at the launch of his new book series Little Leaders and Young Leaders, at GD Birla Sabhagar on November 17.         
	It is this changing system of values that prompted motivational speaker and author of self-help books like the best-selling You Can Win, to pen his latest series.         
	Ninety per cent of our behaviour is habitual, believes Khera. We often act without thinking, he said. The objective of these books is to make positive behaviour a reflex actions, so that one may not have to consciously think in order to do a good deed, explained Khera.         
	Though books have been written earlier on the subject of inculcating values in youngsters, Khera feels that most of them are theoretical in approach.         
	Kheras series are written in the form of modules that children will understand easily.         
	They deal with problems youngsters have to deal with, including developing self-confidence and facing peer pressure.         
	Published by Macmillan India, Little Leaders (for classes I to V) and Young Leaders (for classes VI to VIII) passes up a didactic mode of stating right and wrong in favour of storytelling.         
	Said Harshvardhan Neotia, the chairman of Ambuja Realty, who was present at the launch along with Commissioner of Calcutta Police Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti: Shiv Khera speaks in a contemporary language about values that our grandparents sought to teach us.        
	It is easy to reach out to children, as they are impressionable. The stories will help them think for themselves, for making the right judgement is more important than memorising facts, Khera said.         
	The author explained that parents would also have to be actively involved in the process of a childs development.        
	Khera hopes the books, with class activities designed for discussions between teachers and students, will be included in school curricula.

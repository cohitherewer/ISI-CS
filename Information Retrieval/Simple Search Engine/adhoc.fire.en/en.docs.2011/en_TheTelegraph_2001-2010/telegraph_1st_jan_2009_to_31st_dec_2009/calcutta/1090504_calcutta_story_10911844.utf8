          OUR BUREAU                        WHAT A FEELING! A young Calcuttan on Sunday mirrors the mood of a city that revelled in the first rain of the season after a heat wave. (Sanat Kr Sinha)            THERE SHE BLOWS: The windswept trees on the Maidan announce the storm and shower on Sunday afternoon. Picture by Amit Datta                                       
	Relief came to the scorched city at 82kmph on Sunday afternoon.        
	The seasons first Norwester, aided by windflow patterns over the Chhotanagpur plateau, hit the city with gale force at 3.12pm and dragged down the day temperature to below 30 degrees Celsius for the first time in more than a month.         
	From a days high of 36.5 degrees around 2.30pm, the mercury slipped to 29 degrees in less than an hour  a drop of seven degrees.        
	A trough of low pressure over Bengal and a cyclonic circulation over Jharkhand and its adjoining areas combined to form tall columns of thunderclouds and brought the summers first Norwester to the city, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	The storm abated as quickly as it came, but another short burst and some light rain in the evening ensured that the city remained cool. We recorded 3.4mm of rain till 8.30pm, a Met official said.        
	The weathermen held out hope for more Norwesters. Animesh Chanda, the director of the Patna meteorological office, said conditions were conducive to thundershowers in the next 24 hours in Jharkhand and neighbouring Bengal. The prevailing wind pattern, which is easterly in direction, will help in the accumulation of moisture in the atmosphere, he said.        
	Debnath added from Alipore: There was no Norwester in the city in April, which is unusual. But we might receive the seasons second one within 24 hours of the first.        
	For a parched city that had suffered its hottest and driest April in six decades of recorded meteorological history it was celebration time. People rushed to their terraces or stood outside their homes to revel in the seasons first rain.        
	As the skies rumbled around 3pm, higher secondary student Ahana Bhattashali ran out of her house. I had planned to stay at home throughout Sunday because of the heat. But as it began to rain, my entire family was out on the lawn. We then decided to go and watch a film followed by dinner at a restaurant, she smiled.        
	According to Met officials, the city is supposed to receive around four Norwesters in April. There was none this year. The citys agony mounted as a heat wave gripped the city  loo and all  and the mercury crossed the 40 degrees Celsius mark on eight days.        
	Then, as the humidity levels rose but no raincloud appeared on the horizon, the discomfort index soared and the city became a sauna.        
	Wind speeds on Sunday initially ranged between 60 and 70kmph but the storm gathered speed as it travelled. One gust of wind was recorded at 82kmph, an official said.                
	Flight operations at Calcutta airport were stalled for 40 minutes. Airport officials said no flight took off or landed from 7 till 7.40pm, when it looked like another storm would hit the city.        
	Around 10 flights were delayed by an hour. Air Indias Chennai-Calcutta flight hovered above the city from 7.15pm till 7.40pm before being given permission to land.

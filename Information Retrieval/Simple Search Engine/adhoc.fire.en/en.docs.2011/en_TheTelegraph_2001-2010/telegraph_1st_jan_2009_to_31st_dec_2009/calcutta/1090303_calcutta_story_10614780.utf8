The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Accountant in net for 32-lakh gamble 
                                                                                                               Accountant in net for 32-lakh gamble 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 36-year-old accountant of a transport company allegedly siphoned off nearly Rs 32 lakh over nine months and bet on horses hoping to make enough to replace the stolen money and quit his job.        
	Rajesh Kumar Shah lost every time he placed a wager at the race course. But as he continued to try his luck, his employer found out that Rs 31,60,000 had been fraudulently withdrawn from his account and lodged a complaint with police. Acting on the complaint, the police arrest the accountant in a Sealdah guest house on Monday.        
	Shah was produced in the Sealdah court and remanded in police custody till March 13.        
	We found that Rajesh had withdrawn Rs 31,60,00 from his employers account by forging his signature. He told us that he had lost the entire money betting on horses. Our officers are interrogating him to find out more details, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner (detective department).        
	He had been working as an accountant in Maa Annapurna Transport Company at Topsia for two years. He used to deposit money in a bank on behalf of the company. The bank employees knew him well and didnt suspect anything, said an officer in the bank fraud cell at Lalbazar.        
	In the first week of February, the owner of the company, Pawan Rajgharia, was shocked to find Rs 31,60,000 withdrawn from his account without his knowledge. He smelt a rat and questioned Shah, who feigned ignorance.        
	On February 26, Rajgharia lodged a complaint with the bank fraud cell and told the cops that he suspected Rajesh.        
	Rajgharia found out about the money missing from his account while going through the transaction details. He suspected Rajesh as he used to deposit money in the bank and was also in charge of transactions, added the officer.        
	Shah, a resident of Kestopur in North 24-Parganas, was absconding since last week, after he learnt that the police were investigating the case. On Monday, he was arrested from the guest house where he had taken shelter.        
	He wanted to become rich overnight and hence, started to bet on horses in the hope of making a killing. But lady luck did not smile on him and he kept losing. The amount of money he stole could go up to Rs 1 crore, said another investigating officer.         
	Shah told us that he had planned to put the stolen money back in the bank after making enough profit. He thought nobody would find out about the money being taken out, the officer added.

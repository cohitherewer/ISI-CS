The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Puja deadline for repairs
                                                                                                               Puja deadline for repairs
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Police have asked government agencies to complete all road repairs by September 15 and not to start any project after September 5 in view of Durga puja.        
	Senior police officers set the deadline at a meeting with representatives of all agencies concerned on Monday.        
	Officials of the civic body, PWD, HRBC, CTC, CESC, fire brigade and the port trust attended the meeting, called as part of the pre-Puja exercise by the police.        
	We will inspect ongoing work twice a week and prepare progress reports. A senior officer of the rank of joint commissioner will coordinate with the agencies, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	Before sitting with the agencies, the police had gathered reports about the condition of some key roads from all five divisions.        
	Among the thoroughfares found in bad shape were Khagen Chatterjee Road (north Calcutta) and Kidderpore Road, which have been dug up for development work under the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project.        
	Officials present at the meeting also identified pockets that are dug up for erecting electric or telephone posts.        
	On August 27, the police will interact with members of various puja committees.        
	This year the application form for police permission and other forms that puja organisers have to fill up will be available on the Net. The last date for submitting applications for police permission is September 3, said a senior officer.        
	The idols, the officer added, should not be more than 17.5ft high when carried by trucks. The height limit has been set to ensure smooth movement during immersion. September 28, 29 and 30 have been fixed as immersion dates.        
	Joint commissioner Shamim said: We will hold talks with the port authorities regarding immersion.

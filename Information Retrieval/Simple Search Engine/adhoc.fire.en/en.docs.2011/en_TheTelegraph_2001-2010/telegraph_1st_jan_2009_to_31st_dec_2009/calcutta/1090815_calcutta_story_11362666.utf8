                                                                                                               Whiff of grudge   in youth lynch
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A 22-year-old Howrah resident was clubbed to death after being tied to a post for allegedly stealing a television from a local club to which his family had refused to make a donation.        
	Cycle mechanic Ajay Dutta was warming up for football practice at a Bally playground when members of a club with a supposedly strong Trinamul connection tied him to a electric post and hit him with iron rods and sticks. A friend, Sujay Adhikari, was also caught and assaulted in the same manner but he survived.        
	Ajays brother Sanjay, 19, told police that he heard his elder sibling crying out in pain around 7am and ran to the nearby playground to check whether he had an accident.         
	The first thing that I noticed was my brothers orange jersey on the ground. I hurried towards the adjacent club, where Ajay and Sujay were being mercilessly beaten after being tied to an electric post. When my brother spotted me, he asked me to flee. I took a few steps back and ran, an officer quoted Sanjay as saying.        
	By the time he mustered the courage to return to the club, Ajay was dead and Sujay unconscious.         
	It was premeditated murder. They (the club members) have been nursing a grudge against us since my father refused to make a donation to the club from the money he earned by selling our house, Sanjay said.        
	An officer of Bally police station said a preliminary investigation suggested that the victim did not steal anything from the club.        
	He had no crime record. We are told he was targeted because his family had refused to make a donation to Chandmari Football Association from the amount they earned by selling a house. The allegation is being investigated.         
	Members of the football club had lodged a complaint with Bally police station on Thursday after finding a television missing but did not name anyone.         
	Sources said some members of the club started a parallel investigation despite the police registering the complaint and promising prompt action.        
	The unofficial probe went horribly wrong on Friday morning when the club members pronounced Ajay guilty without a trial.        
	Ajay used to work in a local cycle repair shop and share a rented shanty with his brother since their father Sukumar sold the family house and shifted to Habra, in North 24-Parganas.         
	When he wasnt working, the 22-year-old would spend most of his time playing or thinking about football.        
	Friday morning was to be like any other day when Ajay left home for a practice session Little did he know that he would never play football again, cried Sanjay.        
	Eight club members are absconding since the incident. Sujay, who was critically injured, is undergoing treatment at TL Jaiswal Hospital in Howrah.        
	Ajay is not the first Howrah resident to be subjected to a mob trial for an alleged theft in recent times.        
	On July 2, an 11-year-old boy allegedly caught stealing a cellphone was tied to a lamp post and mauled by a mob within 500 metres of a police station.         
	Ravi Ojha, the son of ragpickers, was lucky not to die or be critically injured after the hitting and kicking. Nobody was arrested.

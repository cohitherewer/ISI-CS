The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Darkness to light, after 23 years
                                                                                                               Darkness to light, after 23 years
  - Cataract surgery delayed by two decades because of hole in girls heart          RITH BASU                          Runa Parveen with her mother at Medical College and Hospital. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                        
	For 23 years Runa Parveen could only perceive that there was light around her. On Tuesday, she saw the light for the first time.        
	I cant believe there is a world that I can now see, Runa told Metro, a day after a simple cataract surgery gifted her the power of sight she had been denied for so long.        
	Runa, a resident of Nangolpota village  around two kilometres from Rajarhat  was diagnosed with cataract-induced blindness and a hole in her heart when she was just a year old. Surgery could have cured her of blindness then itself but doctors said that using general anaesthesia on an infant with a heart condition was fraught with risk.        
	Her unlettered parents  lorry driver Saidul Islam Mollah and wife Abida Biwi  never bothered to get a second opinion.         
	Runa had grown used to being able to feel but not see when a local NGO, Alliance Clubs International, prodded her parents to take her to the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology in Calcutta Medical College and Hospital.         
	Since the culprit was cataract and not congenital blindness, a cure was possible when she became old enough to undergo eye surgery under local anaesthesia, said Ratna Banerjee, the assistant professor of ophthalmology who conducted the long-overdue procedure on Tuesday.        
	Wednesday morning brought with it a combination of anticipation and apprehension for both doctor and patient.         
	Was the surgery successful? Would she be able to see after so many years of living with cataract? When the bandage was removed, Runa wouldnt look up.                           
	It took some coaxing for her to lift her head. All these years, she would speak with her eyes transfixed to the ground because she could not see. I am so happy she no longer has to do that, Banerjee said.         
	According to the doctor, it was a good sign that Runa could count the fingers on a hand from a distance of four feet on the first day itself. She will undergo phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation on her left eye soon.        
	Mother Abida said she had all but given up hope when help came out of the blue. My daughter has never been to school. I wonder how her life would have been had surgery been conducted then.        
	The hole in Runas heart remains but Abida quoted doctors as saying that it was not life-threatening.        
	Ophthalmologist Banerjee said lack of awareness about different types of blindness and their possible cures was responsible for many like Runa living in darkness.         
	 General anaesthesia is required when very small children have to undergo cataract surgery. The doctors who examined her over two decades ago should have asked her parents to take her to an eye clinic again after she grew a little older so that surgery could be conducted under local anaesthesia, she said.        
	Apart from robbing Runa of 23 years of eyesight and a normal life, has the delay in conducting surgery affected her in any way?        
	Prolonged blindness has caused a condition called stimulus deprivation amblyopia, or lazy eye. Her eyes are slow to react. She will, however, have useful, navigable vision for the rest of her life, Banerjee said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Four roadblocks halt rush-hour traffic
                                                                                                               Four roadblocks halt rush-hour traffic

	Four roadblocks between 10.30am and 1.40pm in various parts of the city threw traffic out of gear on Wednesday. Commuters bore the brunt of the traffic disruption as cops struggled with bottlenecks at key intersections and thoroughfares.        
	The reasons for the protests ranged from police excesses on autorickshaw drivers to the delay in publishing results by a school.         
	Sources in the traffic department said the deployment of over 700 constables for election duty made matters worse. The newly recruited traffic home guards, pedestrians said, were left at their wits end by the series of disruptions on Wednesday.        
	The shortage of traffic policemen will continue till the polls are over, said a traffic department officer.        
	Wednesday was bad. Given that the city has just six per cent road space, such disruptions are bound to spell doom, said a senior traffic police officer.         
	The first blockade of the day was on Howrah bridge. Around 8.30am, nearly 500 parents of schoolchildren staged a protest against a steep hike in the fees of various schools.         
	Commuters and railway passengers struggled to make their way across the bridge during the peak period. The demonstration continued for over an hour till senior cops intervened and persuaded the parents to lift the blockade.         
	An hour later, another roadblock was set up at the Lords Bakery intersection in south Calcutta.        
	A section of autorickshaw drivers blocked the crossing from 10.30am to protest alleged police high-handedness during the checking of documents related to the vehicles. Auto drivers on various routes joined the protest and parked their vehicles across the road. The protest continued for over 45 minutes till cops intervened.        
	Around the same time, 20-odd women supporters of the Trinamul Congress blocked the intersection of Lenin Sarani and Taltala Avenue demanding additional traffic cops at the crossing.        
	For 20 minutes, all Sealdah and Entally-bound vehicles had to be re-directed, a senior traffic officer said.         
	At 1.30pm, over 200 parents blocked the intersection of Mahatma Gandhi Road and Surya Sen Street demanding immediate publication of the results of Mitra Institution (Main). The parents and students claimed the results were scheduled to be announced on Wednesday.         
	The agitation was withdrawn when the assistant headmaster of the school assured the protesters that the result would be declared on Thursday.

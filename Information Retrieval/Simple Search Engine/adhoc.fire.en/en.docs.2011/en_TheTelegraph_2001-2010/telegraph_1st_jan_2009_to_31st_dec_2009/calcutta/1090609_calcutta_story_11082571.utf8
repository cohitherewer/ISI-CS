The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bar bill brings out pistol
                                                                                                               Bar bill brings out pistol
          AMRITA GHOSH      
	Three traders enjoying an extended drinking session at an eatery-cum-bar near Howrah station on Monday evening threatened a waiter with an revolver when he presented them with a bill.         
	Krishna Singh, Pradip Kumar Mahajan and Mahesh Sharma were detained on the basis of a complaint by the manager of the eatery. All three are residents of Howrah and have no criminal record.         
	The trio ordered drinks and non-vegetarian items and were chatting among themselves. They looked decent and nothing suggested that they were carrying a firearm. They cleared the first bill of Rs 916 without uttering a word, said 32-year-old waiter Manik Maity, who got the shock of his life when he placed the second bill of Rs 197 on their table.         
	One of them (later identified as Singh) took out a revolver from his pocket and started abusing me. He threatened to shoot me if I did not leave immediately. I kept the bill on the table and walked away, added Maity.         
	He went and reported the matter to the accountant-cum-manager of the eatery, Himangshu Sekhar Choudhury, who immediately alerted the police. I stepped out and alerted policemen patrolling the area. We also informed the police station. Policemen reached in five minutes and detained the trio, he said.        
	The three do not have any criminal record. It appears that they were under the influence of alcohol. Their revolver was licenced, said an officer of Golabari police station.        
	There are around 30 bars near Howrah station, which are packed through the day. Drunks often create nuisance in the area, said a shopkeeper.

	A Positron Emission Tomography  Computed Tomography (PET-CT) machine installed at a city diagnostic centre will help doctors diagnose cancer early.         
	PET-CT helps in early detection of malignant cells and monitoring the recurrence of the disease after treatment, said V. Raja, the president and CEO, GE Healthcare (South Asia) which has produced the PET-CT installed at Eastern Diagnostic Centre in Calcutta.        
	If cancer is diagnosed early, there is 90 per cent chance of it being cured or kept under control. Besides, after one or two cycles of chemotherapy, PET-CT accurately diagnoses whether the tumour has been reduced. A normal CT scan cant do that, he pointed out.        
	During PET-CT scan, a biomarker called Flurodeoxyglucose (FDG) is injected into the patient.         
	The marker makes the malignant cells glow, helping doctors identify the diseased cells and their exact location.

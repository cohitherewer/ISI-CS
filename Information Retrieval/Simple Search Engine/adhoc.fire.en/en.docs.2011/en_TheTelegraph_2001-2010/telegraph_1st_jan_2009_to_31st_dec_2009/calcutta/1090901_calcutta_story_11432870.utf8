The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Killer of techie wife arrested
                                                                                                               Killer of techie wife arrested
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Sushmita Biswas                                  
	The killer of Sinthee resident Sushmita Biswas was arrested on Monday, three days after the 33-year-old was stabbed in the abdomen in her parents house.        
	Sushmitas gold chain, snatched by the two youths who had stormed the Santrapara Lane house on Saturday night, was recovered from Bapi Ghosh.        
	Police said Bapi, a known snatcher, admitted during interrogation that he had stabbed the woman after she grabbed his accomplice Tapas Das and started screaming in an attempt to alert neighbours and passers-by.        
	We are looking for Tapas and a third youth who stood guard outside while the duo entered the two-storeyed house looking for the victims cousin Krishnendu, said an officer of Sinthee police station.        
	Tapas had served a jail term for dacoity several years ago.        
	When Sushmita, wife of a software engineer, opened the door on Saturday night, Bapi and Tapas asked for Krishnendu saying he had not repaid a loan he had taken from them. Sushmita, whose husband is a software engineer, told the duo that Krishnendu had moved out of the house seven months ago.        
	The youths then demanded that Sushmita herself repaid the loan. When she refused, they snatched her gold chain and tried to take away her bangles, too. She then grabbed Tapass hand so tightly that he could not flee, prompting Bapi to stab her.        
	The sleuths have, however, found out that Krishnendu did not owe the youths any money. They had instead come to extort money, said an investigating officer.        
	Krishnendu was into liquor and drugs. This habit brought him in close contact with Tapas and Bapi, said Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	Krishnendu once borrowed money from them but cleared all his dues. Of late, he started paying them for the favours he took from them, Shamim added.        
	The cops identified the duo based on the descriptions provided by Sushmitas mother Madhumita, who said one of the youths had a swelling on his face and the other sported a red tilak on his forehead.         
	The youths had no idea that Krishnendu had not been living in the house for the past seven months, said Shamim.

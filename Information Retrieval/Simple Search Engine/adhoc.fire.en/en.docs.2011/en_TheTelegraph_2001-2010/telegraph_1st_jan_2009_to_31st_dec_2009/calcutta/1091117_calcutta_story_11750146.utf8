	Old north Calcutta came alive on the St Xaviers College stage during the performance of the play, A Medical Crisis  Revisited by the St Xaviers College Alumni Association and the Xaverian Theatrical Society, on November 1.         
	Part of the colleges 150-year celebrations, the play was based on the story Chikitsha Sankat by humourist Rajshekhar Basu.         
	The play charts the journey of Nandadulal Mitra (played by Ritam Siddhanta), a 40-year-old man, who takes a fall when his foot is caught in the folds of his dhoti. Though unhurt, he is convinced by his friends that he is grievously injured, and forced to visit numerous doctors, including a homoeopath, a kabiraj and a hakim. The doctors diagnoses vary from brain tumour to kidney stones, until a female doctor tells him that what he needs is a wife to look after him.                         November 13 saw city celebs bond with kids on Childrens Day eve. (Top) Children of NGO Calcutta Samaritans on a coffee date with actress Pallavie at Coffee World, on Syed Aamir Ali Avenue.

	The play is a satirical take on Bengalis who have the tendency to make a mountain of a molehill, said first-year economics student Kabir Chattopadhyay, who played Sasthi, Nandadulals friend as well as the ayurvedic doctor.        
	The actors had the audience in splits with their comic timing, while the plot found an echo in the present. The play perfectly depicts the situation faced by hapless patients who are misled by doctors out to squeeze them for money, said Yogesh Chopra, a 1994 alumnus.         
	Writing more than 50 years ago, Parashuram could envision todays situation where the layman is often a scapegoat before unscrupulous doctors, said Ashis Siddhanta, who wrote and directed the play. Siddhanta teaches chemistry at St Xaviers College and is the president of Xaviers Theatrical Society.         
	The play re-created the old world charm with songs like the Geeta Dutt classic Babuji dheere chalna. The music by Jadavpur University film studies department teacher Abhijit Roy included tappa, western and Indian classical.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Students appearing for Madhyamik 2012 will only be tested on the basis of whatever they are taught in Class X, the bifurcation putting them on a par with the system followed by other popular boards.        
	Mamata Ray, the president of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, said on Friday that the January to December academic session will be in place from 2012, but the exam will be held in February.        
	For the sake of bifurcation, the syllabi in all the seven subjects taught in classes IX and X have been reorganised. The overall content remains unchanged but certain adjustments have been made to divide topics between classes IX and X, said Ray.        
	For instance, the chapter on light in physical science now taught only in Class IX will be divided in two parts.        
	The rejig of chapters applies to students who will be in Class IX in 2010 and 2011.        
	According to officials, the new bifurcated course will put less pressure on students appearing for the Class IX exam.        
	A number of topics which are now taught in Class IX will be incorporated into the Class X syllabi, they said.        
	But would that not put an extra burden on Class X students and defeat the purpose of the bifurcation? They are not likely to be overburdened with the increased syllabi as they will get more time to prepare for the board exam compared to what they are getting now, an official said.        
	Once the January to December academic session is in place, the teaching duration will increase from 18 weeks to 29 weeks.        
	According to Ray, an overhaul of the Madhyamik syllabi, including its content, is also underway. This revision is meant for Class IX students from 2012.        
	The overhaul aims at restructuring the Madhyamik syllabi in tune with the changes suggested by the Centre. Expert committees comprising senior teachers of schools, colleges and universities have been set up to decide the changes in all the subjects, said Ray.        
	The revised syllabi will be implemented in 2012. But we need to complete the overhaul with time to spare as the textbooks will have to be re-written, a board official said.

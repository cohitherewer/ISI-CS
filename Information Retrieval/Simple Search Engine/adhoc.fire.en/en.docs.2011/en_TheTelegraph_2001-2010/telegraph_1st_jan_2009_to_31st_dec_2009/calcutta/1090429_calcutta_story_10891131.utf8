The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rogue auto rules road
                                                                                                               Rogue auto rules road
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Autorickshaws carrying six passengers were back on the Park Circus connector on Tuesday after political leaders allegedly granted the rogue drivers immunity against police action till the polls.        
	The auto drivers had blocked the key corridor for around 90 minutes on Monday after the police cracked down on three-wheelers carrying more than four passengers.        
	Some autos at Park Circus were booked late last week and slapped with a fine of Rs 3,000. Following Mondays roadblock, the police went soft, apparently under pressure from their political bosses. So on Tuesday traffic constables turned a blind eye to rogue autos.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Daughter dead amp; cremated, parents kept in the dark by cops for 4 months
                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      Daughter dead amp; cremated, parents kept in the dark by cops for 4 months
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                                            
	The parents of a schoolgirl missing since July spent four months doing the rounds of Lalbazar trying to get police to start a probe, little knowing that she was found dead along a rail track and cremated as an unidentified body in the first fortnight of their frantic search.        
	Class X student Rishensi Neha Horos parents Punit and Rashi Horo came to know on Saturday that their daughter was no more, when the police belatedly shared a vital piece of information about a body matching the 15-year-olds description being found by railway police on August 2.        
	The couple were asked to go to the Belur Government Railway Police post, where a pair of jeans, a white and orange T-shirt and a pair of silver-coloured slippers belonging to Rishensi confirmed their worst fears.         
	My little girl was gone and we didnt even know about it because the cops never made the effort to find out what had happened to her, cried Rashi on Sunday.        
	Rishensi, who was a student of St Pauls Boarding Day School on Diamond Harbour Road, did not return after stepping out of her Taratala home around 9.30am on July 31. Her parents said they suspected a local youth of abducting her.                  Rishensi Neha Horo      
	Rashi and Punits plight bears a chilling resemblance to another city couples heartbreaking wait for their missing son, found dead along a rail track and cremated as an unidentified body even as they were running from pillar to post seeking help from inert law-enforcement officials.        
	Atish Sen Gupta, a first-year electrical engineering student, had gone missing exactly a month after Rishensis parents filed a missing diary with Taratala police station. While Atishs parents Deepankar and Joyita came to know about their sons death 24 days later after chasing clues on their own, the Horos kept shuttling between hope and despair until Saturday.        
	Metro had reported on September 14 about mother Rashi accusing the police of not investigating the case. My daughter has been missing for one-and-a-half months and the cops have done little to trace her, she had said.        
	The cops allegedly remained inert even after Rashi met Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner of police (headquarters), on September 16, and detective chief Damayanti Sen on October 3.         
	Both Shamim and Sen gave me a hearing and advised that I speak to officers of the missing squad in Lalbazar. My husband and I visited the missing squads office regularly after that but to no avail. I fail to understand why they did not act on the GRP alert, she said.         
	According to Rashi, she and Punit, an employee of the Alipore mint, visited Lalbazar over 25 times in the past couple of months.         
	Every time we went and asked questions, the answer was: Shothik khobor dile aamra dekhbo (Give us specific information and we will look into it). Nothing can be more ridiculous than the police asking the complainant to do their job, she added.        
	Shamim and Sen were unavailable for comment. Repeated calls to their cellphones on Sunday went unanswered.        
	Bokul Mitra, the additional officer-in-charge of the missing squad, said investigators had not considered the train angle as the FIR mentioned the missing teenager may have been abducted.        
	Rashi said officers of the missing section had called her and husband Punit several times since Saturday to request them not to go public with allegations of police laxity. All of a sudden they have realised their blunder. We are planning to meet the chief minister at Writers Buildings on Monday. We as parents could not even perform the last rites of our daughter. Our only consolation will be punishment to the policemen who failed to do their basic duty, said Punit.        
	On July 31, Rishensi had stepped out saying she would be back in half an hour. When she did not return till evening, we lodged a missing diary. We later filed an FIR saying she had been kidnapped, said Rashi.        
	Sources in the GRP said a railway police team found a girls body between Bally and Uttarpara at 6.15am on August 2.        
	Tanmay Roy Chaudhury, the superintendent of railway police in Howrah, told Metro that Lalbazar and all police stations in the state were informed over wireless at 10.27am on August 2 about such a body being found.         
	Its very unfortunate that the parents came to know about their daughters death four months later. The girls mother identified her after seeing the clothes we had found on the body, he said.        
	The railway police cremated Rishensis body after keeping it in a morgue for 15 days. That is a regulation procedure for unidentified or unclaimed bodies, said an official.        
	According to the post-mortem report, Rishensi died of severe head injuries after being hit by a speeding train.

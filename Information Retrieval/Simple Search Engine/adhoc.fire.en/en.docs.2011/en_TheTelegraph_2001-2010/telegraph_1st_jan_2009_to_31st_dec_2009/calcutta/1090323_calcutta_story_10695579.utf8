	Howrah is set to face another dry summer with the municipal authorities not drawing up a plan to solve problems in the supply of surface water.        
	For several years, taps have been running dry in Howrah in summer forcing residents to queue up for hours for a bucket of water.        
	According to engineers of the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC), the root of the problem lies in the pipe network.        
	The old deep tubewell pipes have to be replaced and the entire water supply network revamped to solve the problem. Patchwork will not be of any help, said a civic engineer.        
	Before 1984, residents depended on deep tubewells, water from which was distributed through pipelines. After Padmapukur Water Works was commissioned, the HMC started supplying water by connecting the main lines with the old deep tubewell pipes. It was a mistake that created a number of low pressure zones in town, said another engineer.         
	Water pressure is maintained when diameters of pipes gradually decrease as they branch out to houses. But diameters of some of the old branch pipes are more than those of the main pipes, added the engineer. This has resulted in a fall in water pressure.         
	The civic body commissioned consultancy firm Ega Energy India Pvt Ltd to survey the pipelines in Howrah in 2007. Their findings matched ours  that faulty pipelines are to blame for the water scarcity in Howrah, said an engineer.         
	Low pressure zones can be found in Pilkhana, Fakirbagan Lane, Nanda Ghosh Road and BL Roy Road (ward 15 and 16), Nurmuhammad Munsi Lane, Jolapara Masjid Lane, Satkari Chatterjee Lane (ward 19), PM Basti (ward 36), Kalikumar Mukherjee Lane, Dharmadas Kundu Lane (ward 34), Ramkrishnapur Lane, Atindra Mukherjee Lane, Umacharan Bose Lane (ward 30), Balai Mistri Lane, Sheikhpara Lane, College Road (ward 38), Kasundia Road (ward 25) and P Road (ward 8), according to civic engineers.

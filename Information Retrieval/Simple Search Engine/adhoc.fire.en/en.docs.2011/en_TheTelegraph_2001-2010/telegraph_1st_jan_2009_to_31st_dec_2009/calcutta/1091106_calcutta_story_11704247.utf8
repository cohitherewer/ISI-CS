  - Bus victim recounts day that maimed family          KINSUK BASU                           If we ever meet (the driver), I would definitely like to ask him, Would you be able to drive with one hand?, Barun Chakraborty said, taking off his spectacles to wipe his tears, six-year-old son Subhadeep by his side. (Sanat Kr Sinha)                                        
	For all his desire to learn, librarian Barun Chakraborty had never imagined that he would be learning to write the alphabet all over again at 45.        
	The hand that wrote is gone. Now my left hand must learn to do what the right did, Chakraborty, whose right forearm was ripped off by a racing bus in August, told Metro the day after stepping out of hospital for the first time in 10 weeks.        
	The bespectacled Jadavpur University librarian, who holds a law degree apart from a masters in library science, has been practising to write ABCD and sign a cheque with his left hand ever since he was able to forget the pain and hold a pen.        
	I realised quickly that I must move on, he said, struggling to put on a black T-shirt before reluctantly accepting help.        
	When six-year-old son Subhadeep touched the bandaged part of the amputated arm, Chakraborty gently rebuked him: Korish naekhono byatha achhe (Dont do thatit still hurts).        
	Wife Jayshree, who lost her entire right arm in the same accident that robbed another passenger of his hand, is still recuperating at SSKM Medical College and Hospital.        
	Memories of the day when the couples lives changed forever keep coming back to Chakraborty as tidal waves of pain.        
	 How can I forget August 25? It was around 10.30am. Me, Jayshree and our son had just boarded a minibus (WB 25A 2392) in Behala to go to Howrah, where we were to meet a homoeopath. We reached SSKM instead  my wife without her right arm, me without my forearm and our little son with a blood-splattered face, he said, his face mirroring the agony of the moment.        
	Chakraborty narrates every little detail of the accident on Dufferin Road and its aftermath  from the way the minibus swerved to avoid a head-on collision with the bus racing down the middle of the road from the opposite side to the way the other passengers walked away from him and his unconscious wife.        
	When the vehicles grazed one another, my reflex action was to push our son, who was sitting on my lap, towards the passenger on my left. Thank god I did that, he said.        
	As he turned to look whether his son was safe, Chakraborty felt an indescribable pain in his right shoulder. I looked at my hand to see whether I could move my fingers, which I could. I even felt the ring on my middle finger. But my forearm was a mangled mass of flesh.        
	The next thing he noticed was Jayshree lying on the seat in front of his with blood squirting like a fountain from where the arm meets the shoulder. I screamed and screamed but there was nobody to listen, he recounted.        
	Two police sergeants arrived a little later and took the injured to SSKM.        
	The first time Chakraborty cried in hospital was when doctors told him that they couldnt save his arm. The second time was when he and Jayshree met for the first time after the surgery. I dont remember how many days had gone by but we saw each other for the first time again when we were taken to the same operating theatre to dress our amputated arms.        
	As he begins life afresh with one arm, the Behala residents greatest source of strength remains his son. My wife is also learning to write with her left hand so that she can continue helping Subhadeep with his homework. As for me, I told some of my students from Gyanchandra Ghosh Polytechnic (he is a visiting lecturer) recently that I may not be able to give them handwritten notes but I can certainly give them lectures, Chakraborty said.        
	He has heard of options like an artificial arm with built-in sensors but money is a factor. They cost Rs 6 lakh each, which I cant afford. Maybe I wont miss my right arm so much once the left one learns to do the job of both.         
	Now that he is out of hospital, would he like to meet the driver (out on bail) responsible for his plight?        
	If we ever meet, I would definitely like to ask him one question: Would you be able to drive with one hand?, Chakraborty said, taking off his spectacles to wipe his eyes.

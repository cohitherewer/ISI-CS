The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ready road left unused
                                                                                                               Ready road left unused
                            
	The 3.5km road connecting Prince Anwar Shah Road to the EM Bypass is a motorists nightmare with vehicles forced to switch flanks at an extremely congested crossing and a shop jutting into the road. The road was widened from 50ft to 100ft long ago but the authorities have kept only one flank open. Metro visits the problem stretch               
	Road closed to traffic                  
	Vehicles from both directions are forced to share a flank that should have been used only by Bypass-bound ones along half the length of the connector  from Sapuipara to the base of Jibanananda Setu. This despite the other flank being ready. In the mornings, the Sapuipara market spills over to the lane open to traffic, further reducing its width.        
	Bottlenecks and accidents are thus common on the stretch. The day after Kali puja, a motorcyclist was knocked down by a car at the Sapuipara junction and run over. Accidents occur every other day at this spot because of lane changing, said Dipak Gorai, who runs a motorcycle repair shop beside the thoroughfare.        
	On the unused flank leading to Jadavpur police station, the freshly laid bitumen has disappeared under heaps of sand and stone chips. Metro also spotted an autorickshaw stand (Sapuipara to Jadavpur police station) under the Citu banner, a taxi stand, a minibus stand and a vat on the road. A Kali puja pandal was built hogging the entire width of the flank.        
	Only between Sapuipara and the Bypass, both lanes are open to traffic.         
	Official word: The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has just finished negotiating with a couple of families whose houses are on the thoroughfare. They will be compensated and the flank should open to traffic shortly, said Sunil Chakraborty, the councillor of the Calcutta Municipal Corporations ward 106. He added that the CMDA had plans to widen Jibanananda Setu too, which is single-lane now.                
	No signals, road-hog shop        
	There are no traffic signals or road markings on the stretch, making it even more difficult for motorists. Driving is particularly tricky 100 metres from Jibanananda Setu, where a ration shop juts into the road, covering almost 50 per cent of the Bypass-bound flank.         
	Accidents are a regular occurrence on this stretch as drivers speeding down the flyover dont expect a concrete structure right on the road. They are forced to swerve suddenly to avoid colliding with the shop and this leads to mishaps, said Shantanu Palit of Kalikapur, who takes this road to work every day.        
	Official word: We have felt the need for traffic lights on this road and they will soon be installed. We were waiting till we were in a position to open both flanks, said Chakraborty.         
	He said the road widening was delayed because of legal hurdles.         
	The owner of the ration shop slapped a case on the CMDA after it decided to acquire the land where the shop stands. But the matter has been settled and the shop will soon be pulled down, he added.                
	Pavement peeve        
	The pavements along the connector have been taken over by vats, garages, building materials, rickshaw stands, cycle repair shops and trucks. Some eateries have even put out chairs and tables on the footpaths.        
	Official word: I cant recall any eviction drive on this stretch. Our main aim was to complete construction of the two flanks of the road from Jadavpur police station to the Bypass and open it to traffic. Now that the construction is complete, the next task will be to free the sidewalks,said Chakraborty

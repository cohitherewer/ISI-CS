The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Transporters review stand 
                                                                                                               Transporters review stand 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Transport operators are finally looking to replace vehicles over 15 years old after losing hope of a favourable Supreme Court verdict while the state government struggles to expedite the process.        
	Major operators who are part of the Banijyik Paribahan Bachao Committee met on Wednesday to review the situation after Mondays hearing of their plea against the high court ban on old commercial vehicles.         
	The mood was sombre. Most have given up hope of getting relief in the form of a stay or an extension. Even if a favourable verdict comes our way, it would be too late, an operator who attended the meeting told Metro.        
	We primarily discussed how to go about the replacement process. Most are willing to go ahead with it now since relief from the apex court looks distant, said committee chief Swarnakamal Saha.        
	The committee would suggest measures that can speed up the process to transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury within a few days.        
	Till Wednesday, operators filed applications for replacement of 153 buses and minibuses and only 90 replacement orders were issued. Over 3,000 buses and minibuses have not made the cut.        
	The entire process would take about 90 days, said Chowdhury. The government had earlier claimed the process would take 30 days.        
	On Wednesday morning, the transport secretary met officials and operators at the public vehicles department, where auto operators complained of delays in conversion and harassment by touts.        
	I cannot sort out the problem on my own. The new minister will assume charge shortly. He will do something about it, said Chowdhury.        
	He announced a camp at Netaji Indoor Stadium for speedy submission and processing of applications for conversion of autos and replacement of buses and minibuses.

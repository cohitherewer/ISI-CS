                                                                                                               Check-up of home inmates
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Most of the 31 boys staying in Jatio Jorodhi Sansad in Baruipur are extremely malnourished, said doctors after examining them on Tuesday afternoon.         
	The five-member medical team was sent to the home for mentally challenged boys by the sub-divisional officer (SDO) of Baruipur after Sarat, a 17-year-old inmate, died of malnutrition on Sunday night.        
	The boys in the home are suffering from several diseases because of malnourishment, said one of the doctors.         
	Ranadeb, a teenaged inmate who lost his vision at the home, needs immediate hospitalisation, according to the doctors.        
	The authorities of the home have refused to accept that Sarat died of malnutrition though the death certificate said so.        
	Abdul Goni, the SDO of Baruipur, said a report on the functioning of the home has been sent to the South 24-Parganas district magistrate.        
	We are planning to transfer the children to different homes. Till that is not done, we will provide them better quality food. I have also asked the local panchayat to provide support to the children, said Goni.         
	The home started functioning in 1994. It used to receive financial assistance from the state and central governments.        
	Currently, the home only gets irregular financial aid from the state government, claimed the authorities.        
	We will inform the social welfare department about the problems we face while running the home. We do the best at our end, said Tripti Mitra, the founder of the home.

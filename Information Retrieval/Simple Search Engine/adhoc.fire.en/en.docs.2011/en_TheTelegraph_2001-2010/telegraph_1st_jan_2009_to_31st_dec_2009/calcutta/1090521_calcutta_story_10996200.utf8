The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City shines on scoreboard   More schools fare better
                                                                                                               City shines on scoreboard 
  More schools fare better        MITA MUKHERJEE                           HE IS THE CHAMPION: Subhojit Ghosh, flanked by father Subhashish and mother Sujata, hours after he learnt that he had scored a record 99.25 per cent in ISC 2009.

	The city may fail to retain the best brains but as long as they stay in Calcutta, they are capable of outscoring their counterparts in other metros.        
	The ICSE and ISC results, which were declared on Wednesday, proved that some of the best brains are still bred in Bengal as the city schools matched the performances in cities like Mumbai and Bangalore.        
	Subhojit Ghosh of St Josephs College, a school on BB Ganguly Street, created history by scoring 99.25 per cent, an all-time ISC record.        
	I am happy with my performance. It is also good to learn that Calcutta schools have done much better this time, said Subhojit, who attributed his success to his school and the academic infrastructure in his city.         
	A girl from the Asansol branch of the Assembly of God Church School in Burdwan district, Ankita Mukherjee, scored the highest in the state  and second highest in the country  with a score of 98.6 per cent in ICSE 2009.        
	Not just individual performances, the best thing about this years result is a collective improvement of performance by the schools, said Gerry Arathoon, the additional secretary and officiating chief executive and secretary of the Council for Indian School Certificate Examination.        
	Calcutta schools performed extremely well this time. If the all-India trend is taken into consideration, Calcutta is not lagging behind other big cities, added Arathoon.        
	According to him, there has been a marked improvement in the number of students scoring over 90 per cent across different categories of schools. Instead of a few schools with a very high concentration of top performers, several middle-rung schools in Calcutta have thrown up top performers.        
	Even if we look at the pass percentage, there is an improvement by at least two per cent vis--vis last year. Pass percentage in the city is almost equal to that of Mumbai and Bangalore, where we have a good number of our affiliate schools, said Arathoon.         
	Data provided by the council proves the claim. In ICSE, the pass percentage in Calcutta is 98 per cent, which is almost the same as in Bangalore and marginally lower than Mumbais almost 99 per cent. In ISC, Calcutta, Bangalore and Mumbai have the same pass percentage, around 97.75 per cent.                    
	Over 1.6 lakh students appeared for the exams  1,08,217 in ICSE and 52,552 in ISC  across the country this year. The city has the maximum number of council-affiliated schools. Though we dont want to encourage the rat race among students, there is little doubt that producing two toppers in a single year is a big achievement, said a council official, referring to Subhojit and Ankita.        
	Arathoon emphasised the need for maintaining quality for which schools have been instructed to appoint qualified teachers and expand academic infrastructure.        
	For the council, this years other big achievement is an even spread of good performers. All categories of schools  ranging from the reputable Christian missionary institutions to the newly set up private schools  improved on their performance and produced several top performers.         
	The fact that our students have performed equally well in all the subjects is an indication that they are growing up as well-rounded kids, said Keya Sinha, the principal of Vivekananda Mission.        
	The council lays special emphasis on well-rounded grooming of students and their exposure to a variety of co-curricular activities.         
	Students have done extremely well in subjects which are less scoring like history and civics, geography and environmental education, said Ranjan Mitter, principal, Future Foundation School.

          A STAFF REPORTER                          Nata Mullick                                        
	Hangman Nata Mullick died of age-related complications at NRS Medical College and Hospital on Monday morning. The 89-year-old had to be admitted to hospital a number of times in the past year.        
	Mullick, a resident of Tollygunge, was the only hangman appointed by the government. He executed 25 people in over half a century of service.        
	He became well known before his last execution  that of Dhananjoy Chatterjee, a security guard who had raped and murdered 14-year-old schoolgirl Hetal Parekh  in 2004.        
	Mullick, who had acted in the role of a hangman in Mrinal Sens Mrigaya, appeared in a number of jatras after Chatterjees hanging.         
	Mullicks son Debabrata, who used assist his father, is likely to be appointed as hangman, said government sources.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Reality check for realty
                                                                                                               Reality check for realty
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Recession has prompted realty to run a long-awaited reality check and reduce prices.        
	Residential projects to be launched at the Credai realty show next week  between March 4 and 8  would be 25 to 30 per cent cheaper than existing apartments in the same areas, according to the realtors umbrella body.        
	For the first time, the focus at a property fair will be on affordable housing and 80 per cent of the apartments showcased will come in the Rs 10 lakh to 40 lakh bracket, said Pradip Chopra, a member of the governing body of Credais state chapter.        
	At least 20 new housing projects will be launched at the realty expo, with flats priced between Rs 10 and 25 lakh, Credai officials said. In all, over 150 products will be on display in the residential segment, while a separate pavilion will be set up for commercial projects.        
	We wrote to all our member developers, stressing the need for a price correction in these trying times. We hope the result of that initiative would be reflected in the prices of new properties, said Pradeep Sureka, the president of Credai Bengal.        
	Realtors, desperate to boost the market, are also lining up add-ons and freebies, besides introducing innovative marketing devices like back-loaded EMIs, wherein a flatowner starts repaying the home loan after moving in.        
	The focus is shifting towards affordable housing, and prices are being corrected in all brackets. A marginal reduction in land cost and some rollback in steel and cement prices have brought down construction cost to some extent. This benefit must be entirely passed on to the consumer, said Santosh Rungta, the vice-president of Credai.        
	A chunk of the cost is the load of levies, Sureka pointed out. If the government is willing to forego some taxes, we can create around 20,000 dwelling units every year in the Rs 4 to 12-lakh bracket, he promises.

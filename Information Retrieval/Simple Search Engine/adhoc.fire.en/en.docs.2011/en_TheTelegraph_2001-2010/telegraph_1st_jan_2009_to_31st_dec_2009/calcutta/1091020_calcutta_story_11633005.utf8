The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Diwali cops in deface drive
                                                                                                               Diwali cops in deface drive

	Break a rule to try and bolster another was the Calcutta police formula this Diwali.        
	In a bid to draw public attention to the decibel ban, the cops took the easy way out by plastering private walls with posters in blatant violation of the defacement law.        
	How can the custodians of the law flout visual pollution rules to try and impose noise pollution norms, said environmental activist S.M. Ghosh, who blamed the bungle on the polices belated attempt to impose the cracker ban.        
	Thousands of posters printed by the police, pasted on walls by hired hands, have defaced private walls in the run-up to Diwali.        
	The police, of course, did not even bother to obtain the mandatory written permission from the residents or owners before defacing their walls in several parts of the city centre.        
	Nobody approached us for permission, written or otherwise. We suddenly woke up one day to find scores of Calcutta police posters on the boundary walls of our complex, said a businessman who lives on Loudon Street, a shout away from police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabartis official residence.        
	So did the police keep the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) informed about its Diwali defacement drive?        
	We were neither intimated nor was our permission sought, said a CMC official.        
	Section 202 of the CMC Act of 1980 stipulates up to six months in prison and a fine of Rs 50,000 for the person(s) actually responsible for the defacement.        
	But who will police the police? Legal action can be initiated by the CMC only if there are specific complaints lodged. Even then, penal action can only be taken against the person putting up the poster and not the authorities responsible, said a legal expert from the Election Commission of India, which had sought to implement the law with respect to wall graffiti in Calcutta during the Lok Sabha polls earlier this year.        
	Even the political parties had sought our permission before writing wall graffiti for the Lok Sabha polls. But the police behaved like bullies and just plastered our walls with close to a hundred posters, said the resident of a highrise building on Theatre Road.        
	Jawed Shamim, the joint commissioner (headquarters), denied knowledge of any such violation. I dont know who told you this, but we havent received any such complaint.... If and when someone complains, the law will take its course, he said.        
	But none of the defacement victims that Metro spoke to on Monday was willing to lodge a complaint against the cops. I cant complain. I have to continue doing business and living with my family in the city, said the owner of a sari showroom on Shakespeare Sarani. The defacement is a shame but who would dare raise his voice against the police? he added.

                                                                                                               Ruthful tales 
                              Ruth Kirkpatrick at a storytelling session with a patua at Weavers Arts and Media Resource Centre                             
	Ruth Kirkpatrick from Scotland is a bloody good storyteller. She tells old Scottish tales that dont spare any blood and gore. She doesnt spare her young audience any either.         
	I tell a story in which the stepmother loses her temper and kills the stepdaughter. Then she cooks her and eats her up, says Ruth. In the age of political correctness and sensitivity to the multi-cultural sensibility  Oxford has renamed Christmas the Winter Light Festival  isnt the story a problem?         
	Sometimes there is a problem with teachers. But the children love it. They like the dark side of life, she says. For, in the end there is justice. The girls spirit becomes a white dove and seeks revenge. The stepmother dies. The girls spirit goes to heaven and finds peace.         
	No, the stepmother is not cooked and eaten up. Because the good wouldnt do that.         
	The Oxford Junior bookstore is filling up. The very young audience is trickling in, school having just got over. They are here to listen to Ruth. She is visiting Calcutta in connection with Book Fair at which Scotland is the focal theme.         
	Ruth, a bright, sprightly woman from Edinburgh with a musical voice, is a professional storyteller. In my country, traditional storytellers were called Travellers, a poor, nomadic people, who told old Scottish tales. It was a dying tradition. I am lucky that their stories were given to me, she says.         
	She tells many stories of Jack, of Jack and the Beanstalk. But Jack is many boys in her stories.         
	Sometimes he is very foolish. Sometimes he is foolish and clever. Sometimes he is a hero. Sometimes he makes so many mistakes. He is mad and impossible. The children love that too.         
	She usually tells fairy tales of hard, long Scottish winters, snow-covered mountains and the sudden joy of spring. To the young  she fell to storytelling when she worked at a social work organisation with children suffering from trauma  and also to teenagers and adults. Often at festivals.         
	When she worked with a group of Asian children in Glasgow, she had at first thought that she would tell Asian stories. But then she decided to stick to European stories, my stories, about my culture, for the issues in all stories are universal.         
	So at Oxford Junior she tells the story of the hard, old, bitter goddess of winter, Beira, lonely, ugly, with two orange teeth, her hair standing out, rampaging angrily over the cold, grey Scottish winter landscape, beating the ground with her switch into hills and mountains, of Bride, Beiras young, beautiful maid whom the goddess despises and Angus, a young, handsome prince.         
	Angus falls in love and rescues Bride. They get married. Spring comes to earth. Bride becomes the goddess of Spring.         
	The children love it. But Beira is back every winter too!                          CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Forensic delay holds up cases
                                                                                                               Forensic delay holds up cases
          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                              
	Examination of nearly 10,000 samples of viscera and other organs is pending at the state forensic science laboratory, delaying criminal cases and disbursement of insurance claims.        
	Viscera refer to the large organs in the body that are examined by forensic experts to establish the cause of a persons death. The findings of viscera examination constitute a vital part of evidence in trials involving mysterious or accidental deaths.         
	About 3,500 samples are sent to the laboratory annually but only 2,000 are tested. The annual backlog of 1,500 has piled up to touch nearly 10,000, said a forensic official.         
	The laboratory prepared 1,853 reports in 2007 and 2,227 last year.        
	D. Sengupta, the director of laboratory, said he was trying to speed up sample tests. It is a difficult and time-consuming process. We have to perform the tests very carefully since the slightest mistake can alter the report and affect its evidential merit. He was not sure when the backlog would be cleared.         
	Laboratory officials blamed the slow pace on the tardiness of viscera examiners and vacant posts in the toxicology department. The wing currently has seven examiners and three posts are vacant.        
	An examiner in the toxicology department tested only two samples in 2008 before retiring in June this year. Many of the other examiners are testing about 250 samples a year, which means less than a sample a day, said an official.        
	He cited lack of instruments and infrastructure as the other reasons for the delay in performing tests and completing reports.        
	According to insiders, 35 to 40 tests can be conducted daily with the available infrastructure.        
	Since the forensic report is needed to claim insurance benefits following mishap deaths, the delay has brewed corruption. Cops, on behalf of insurance nominees, bribe laboratory officials to obtain reports quickly, alleged a laboratory official.

                                                                                                                         3                                                                                      CU body meet on test demand
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University has called an emergency meeting of its undergraduate council on Thursday to discuss the demand for holding supplementary tests for those who have failed in the BA./B.Sc Part I and II exams.        
	The authorities are in a fix over the demand, fearing that supplementary tests would set a bad precedent and encourage all unsuccessful examinees to raise similar demands in future.        
	Officials said the tests would affect the academic standard of the university and disrupt the process of conducting the annual exams.        
	Student bodies backed by all political parties have submitted memoranda to the CU authorities demanding supplementary exams.        
	Similar demands have also been pouring in from individual students and teachers since the publication of the BA/BSc Part I and II results on November 26. Many examinees had complained of gross anomalies in their results.        
	Pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee said: A final decision on the matter will be taken on the basis of the outcome of tomorrows meeting.

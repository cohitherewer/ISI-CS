                      Of inhuman bondage                    It is estimated that 700,000 to 4 million women and children are trafficked around the world today, with no less than 2.5 million women engaged in flesh trade. Unfortunately, the term sex worker conceals the truth that no woman takes up this profession by choice: girls are stolen, lured, tricked, locked up and forced to serve multiple clients. Labour movements and legislations that guarantee minimum rights to sex workers are of little help. Let alone retirement benefits or pension during old age, these women are physically and psychologically violated, exploited and traumatised throughout their lives, having to undergo several abortions and becoming victims to diseases like jaundice, tuberculosis and HIV-AIDS. Yet, these victims are stigmatised and shunned by society, whereas traffickers and brothel owners go scot-free. To mark International Womens Day on March 8, Apne Aap, in collaboration with American Center and supported by Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR), hosts a festival of films (with English subtitles) to raise awareness on human trafficking. To be screened today: Emmy award-winning documentary The Selling of Innocents (dir: Ruchira Gupta; English, 11.30 am) and Kaal (dir: Bappaditya Bandyopadhyay; Bengali, 3.30 pm). March 6: Human Trafficking (English, 11.30 am), Chameli (dir: Sudhir Mishra, Hindi, 2.30 pm; a scene from it appears here), Mando Meyer Upakhyan (dir: Buddhadeb Dasgupta; Bengali, 4.30 pm) and Trade (English, 6.30 pm). The festival closes with an interactive discussion on March 7 (10.30 am - 1 pm).                  Event: A film festival to mark International Womens Day When: March 5 - 7 Where: Rabindranath Tagore Centre, Indian Council for Cultural Relations, 9A Ho Chi Minh Sarani
